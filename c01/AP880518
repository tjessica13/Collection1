   Authorities seized more than two tons of cocaine in the Florida
Keys, cut off a drug supply line to a New York resort and charged
four people with possession of 1{ tons of marijuana in Alabama in
three separate actions Wednesday.
   Customs agents said a patrol vessel chased down a high-speed
boat running without lights in the Florida Keys just before dawn
Wednesday, and found more than two tons of cocaine aboard. Three
Florida men and a Colombian national were arrested and their
38-foot boat confiscated, said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   Authorities had not determined the value or exact weight of the
cocaine, which they said was in 50 bales weighing from up to 75
pounds each.
   Federal authorities in Mobile, Ala., charged four people,
including a West German couple, with possession of 1{ tons of
marijuana and 236 pounds of a substance believed to be hashish oil,
worth a combined street value of more than $20 million.
   A supply line that would have brought nearly eight tons of
cocaine into the Hamptons on New York's Long Island for the resort
season was cut off by undercover agents who confiscated the first
shipment, faked a delivery and made nine arrests, officials said
Wednesday in Farmingdale, N.Y.
   The 1,200-pound shipment _ and the plane it was coming in on _
were seized in Miami because the plane, which was under
surveillance on its journey, had engine trouble and put down there
on its way from Colombia to Suffolk County Airport in Westhampton
Beach, N.Y.
   The 1,200 pounds of cocaine, divided into small packets, could
have been sold for $80 million, state police Capt. Walter Heesch
estimated.
   Special Customs Agent Arthur Stiffel said the import ring had
planned to bring in 1,000 pounds of cocaine every 48 hours for 30
days to sell in the Hamptons, the group of villages that have
become a swanky New York summer retreat.
   ``We got them on their first run,'' said Stiffel. ``They were
just gearing up so they had enough supplies during the peak sale
period of the summer.''
   Eight men, including two Columbian nationals, were charged with
conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine.
   In the pre-dawn raid Wednesday on a secluded Alabama waterfront
home, a motorcycle, a 1988 Mercedes car, a 1986 Ford pickup,
$28,000 in cash, two sailboats, a motorboat and two life rafts,
were confiscated, U.S. Customs agent Gary Wright said.
   Wright said the drugs were smuggled into the Gulf Coast from a
foreign distribution point apparently aboard a 35-foot sailboat.

   Six months after desperate Cuban detainees took
138 hostages and seized control of federal prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La., the government is paroling them in unprecedented
numbers.
   But the government program baffles some of the inmates and their
lawyers. They complain that the parole policy is incoherent and
inconsistent, quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundreds
with sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparent
reason.
   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1,093
detainees have been freed since the uprisings, compared with 92
released in the six months preceding the riots. INS officials deny
the uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy.
   In all, since the riots ended in early December, 2,224 Cubans
have been recommended for release and 1,208 have been deemed unfit
for the streets, said Duke Austin, spokesman for the INS in
Washington. Twenty-four detainees have been marked for deportation,
and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by May
31.
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III promised the full reviews
as part of an agreement that ended the riots, in which one Atlanta
detainee was killed and several others were injured. None of the
hostages was injured.
   The 2,400 men in detention at Atlanta and Oakdale last fall had
committed crimes after arriving in this country from the Cuban port
of Mariel in 1980, when Fidel Castro allowed 125,000 Cubans to
leave.
   At the time of the riots, however, the detainees had served
their sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest of
the INS.
   Some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four years
when they learned that the State Department and Cuba had
reactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of ``excludable''
immigrants.
   The Oakdale center erupted in flames on Nov. 21; the Atlanta
prison fell to the Cubans two days later. The Justice Department
would later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant four-hour
notice given prison officials by the State Department.
   The Louisiana siege ended after eight days, but Atlanta's
uprising went on until Dec. 4, becoming one of the longest in
federal prison history. Damage at the two prisons was estimated at
$64 million.
   The prisons were shut down, and the detainees, some of whom
insisted they would rather die than return to Cuba, were scattered
to prisons across the country. Since then, most of have been held
in ``lockdown'' status, confined to special seclusion areas 23
hours a day.
   ``They just sit in those cells, waiting and getting depressed,''
said Linda Serrano of Atlanta, whose common-law husband, Manuel
Casalis Noy, was approved for parole in November but has yet to be
released.
   Despite the release statistics, some advocates for the detainees
_ including Bishop Augustin Roman of Miami, who helped end the
sieges _ maintain the government has not completely lived up to its
promise.
   ``The detainees aren't being given full reviews, they're just
being interviewed. What's more, the government doesn't even make an
official record of these panel reviews, something you must have if
there is to be an effective appeal process,'' said Karen Ellingson,
a Legal Aid attorney in Minneapolis who has sat in on more than 70
interviews conducted by the 20 two-person INS review teams.
   The pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots, detainee
advocates say.
   Late last month, U.S. Justice Department spokesman Patrick
Korten said the accelerated, post-riot releases reflected a more
liberal parole policy. However, Craig Raynsford, associate counsel
at INS, said, ``I assure you these people are not being more
favorably treated because they rioted.''
   He said the number of parolees has risen sharply because the
review procedure implemented last June was slow and laborious, and
only recently began to bring about large numbers of releases.
   ``There's a cumulative effect at work here,'' he said. ``Our
parole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent, the same as
it was before the riots.''
   Gary LeShaw, an attorney who works with the Atlanta-based
Coalition to Support Cuban Detainees, said his office is still
swamped with calls for help. More than 1,100 men approved for
release remain in prison ``for one reason or another, such as a
shortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors,'' he said.
   Supporters of the detainees note that, prior to the riots, all
but about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses. Since
December, hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to their
families and sponsors.
   ``Some detainees are being released right away, almost pushed
out onto the street, while others, including some who have good
prison records and committed far less serious crimes, remain behind
bars for months,'' said LeShaw. ``Nobody seems to know what's going
on.''
   Although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach,
Raynsford said all look for the same thing in making
recommendations: ``Whether the detainee is presently non-violent
and likely to stay that way, whether he is likely to present a
threat to the community, and whether he is likely to violate his
parole.''
   He also noted that a special appeals tier had been created for
detainees who are turned down for parole. Even those who have been
scheduled for ``repatriation'' to Cuba can appeal.
   ``But these are just paper appeals,'' said Ms. Ellingson. ``You
don't get to face your accusers. Besides, it's just another case of
the INS, which has been responsible for the incarceration of the
detainees, acting as their judge and jury.''
   She gave a recent experience as an example of why the process is
so frustrating:
   ``Officials of Dismas House, a non-profit facility in Kansas
City, recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved for
parole. The halfway house took 18 of them and left the others
stranded in prison, not even knowing why they weren't selected,
much less when they would be released.''
   Asked why, the director of Dismas House, the Rev. Everett
Thornton, said he had room for only 18 detainees. ``We try and look
for motivation, that's the most important thing,'' he said.
   But Ms. Ellingson said other factors are involved, such as a
detainee's appearance and his ability to speak English, ``things
that really shouldn't matter that much.''
   Even some detainees who have been released question the fairness
of the INS process. One of them is Mario Ochoa of Brooklyn, who was
released in March, just three weeks after his panel hearing.
   ``I think I was released so quick because my wife went to
Washington several times and talked to congressmen and reporters
about my case; she really worked hard for me,'' said Ochoa, who
finished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadly
weapon with intent to use it.
   ``But,'' he added, ``I'm one of the lucky ones. There are others
still in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimes
than I did. I really can't figure out what's going on.''

   The resurrection of the Oakdale Federal
Detention Center is under way, six months after it was nearly
destroyed by rioting Cubans and none too soon for many Allen Parish
residents.
   ``If it reopened tomorrow, it would be six months too late,''
said Sandy Strother, a 25-year-old resident of this south central
Louisiana town of 7,200.
   ``I'm ready for it to reopen,'' she said. ``In fact, I've
applied for a job there.''
   Last Nov. 21, the 1,000 Cubans held here pending federal
decision on their future went on a rampage at the news that some
would be deported to their native land. They burned 10 of the 14
buildings at the $17 million center and took 28 guards hostage.
   Two days later, Cubans at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta
followed suit. That uprising lasted until Dec. 4, while the siege
at Oakdale ended after eight days.
   Assistant Warden Art Espinoza, a 25-year veteran of the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons, arrived at the Oakdale center the night before
the Cubans rioted.
   ``I've been through riots, but I've never been to a place before
where they burned the place down,'' Espinoza said.
   A pair of dormitories, which escaped with only broken windows
and some minor damage, serve as temporary administration offices
and housing for about 45 inmates maintaining the site.
   Inside, bright white, orange and yellow paint makes the
dormitories nicer than those on some college campuses. There are no
steel-gray cells with bars and wire mesh here.
   ``If you would have walked in the first day after it was over,
you would never have believed people who lived here would have
destroyed it, as nice as it was,'' Espinoza said.
   Despite the destruction, Espinoza said he had no animosity
toward the Cubans. ``Inmates are inmates. Just because they burned
the place down we can't say we don't want those types here,'' he
said.
   A Justice Department report released earlier this month placed
some of the blame for the Oakdale and Atlanta riots on prison
officials. It said they failed to recognize signs of impending
trouble.
   The report also said placing Cubans at the Oakdale facility, a
low- to medium-security alien processing center, was a ``calculated
risk.''
   Espinoza said rebuilding the center will cost more than $13
million and should be finished by Oct. 1. The prison should being
taking new inmates by November.
   Oakdale Mayor George Mowad said he'd been assured by federal
officials that the prison would not again be home to a large group
of a single type of illegals, such as the Cubans from the 1980
Mariel boatlift.
   ``Any concentration of Cubans, our people would be upset with,''
Mowad said. ``The people of Oakdale were very proud of that
facility. And then to go out and see it destroyed ... it was hard.''
   Mowad says those worries aren't enough to keep the town from
eagerly anticipating the prison's reopening. ``We had 100 percent
support for it before it burned. After the riot it dropped to about
90 percent, but we've got most of those people back.''
   After the Oakdale center is rebuilt, a second phase called
Oakdale II is tentatively scheduled to open in November 1989, Mowad
said. With both facilities operating, the 500 federal jobs would
make the detention center the city's No. 1 employer.
   Each month since the riot, Oakdale has lost $6,000 in water,
sewer and sales tax revenue, Mowad said.
   A few reminders of the uprising remain. The once landscaped
grounds and paths at the prison now have patches of bare earth
glaring in the sun.
   In some areas not yet scrubbed and repainted, slogans remain,
such as ``Muertos No Cuba'' _ ``Death, Not Cuba.''

   These days, a visitor can drive directly through
wide-open iron gates and park within 20 yards of the U.S.
Penitentiary's front steps.
   Those are the same steps descended by 89 hostages when they
poured out of the prison last Dec. 4, ending an 11-day uprising by
more than 1,100 Cuban inmates.
   The penitentiary then was less a prison than a badly damaged
fortress under siege. The front steps, patrolled constantly by
armed federal officers, led to a building only partly controlled by
authorities. The rest was in the hands of Cuban detainees, who
rioted at word of a deportation agreement with Fidel Castro.
   When it was all over, the prison was emptied of all inmates for
the first time since it opened in 1902 and officials began cleaning
up the damage. Officials estimated the damage here and in Oakdale,
La., where Cuban inmates staged a similar uprising, at $64 million.
   Now, 600 inmates, all Americans, are housed at the prison,
compared with about 200 Americans and 1,400 Cuban inmates at the
time of the takeover. In two years, the number is to reach 800 to
850. So far, there are no plans to bring Cuban detainees to
Atlanta, said Mike Caltabiano, executive assistant to Warden Joseph
Petrovsky.
   The riot interrupted a $63 million, five-year renovation
project, but many of the areas damaged were to be razed in the
renovation anyway, Caltabiano said.
   The only real loss, he said, was the burned-out prison
industries building.
   A temporary industries unit has been set up in a former
gymnasium. There, inmates repairing mailbags and making mattresses
and meteorological parachutes earned $500,000 for the prison in
April, Caltabiano said.
   A 20-foot-high chain link fence is being erected to cut the
prison almost in half. Behind it, most of the construction will go
on. The first phase of the renovation project is to be completed
next year.
   Elsewhere, vandalism in the dining hall and chapel has been
repaired.
   ``It's been the positive attitude of the staff that's made it,
by putting this kind of thing behind them and saying, `OK, we're
going to see how we can rebuild Atlanta,''' Caltabiano said.
   The prison is ``Atlanta'' or ``USP (U.S. Penitentiary) Atlanta''
to its employees. It was known as the ``Big A'' to decades of
inmates, including the famous and the infamous.
   At the dawn of the 1920s, the ``Big A'' was home to Socialist
presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, who was imprisoned for a
speech condemning war in World War I. It held Al Capone in the
1930s, Soviet spy Rudolph Able in the 1950s and Mafia informant Joe
Valachi in the 1960s.
   In the late 1970s, there were 16 slayings at the prison, many
described as professional ``hits'' related to drug sales. By 1978,
a report by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons suggested closing the
penitentiary because its old design and deteriorating structures
made security impossible.
   The prison was to have been closed by the fall of 1984.
   But the number of Cuban inmates, detained during the Mariel
boatlift because of their records in Cuba or imprisoned later for
offenses in the United States, mounted.
   Violence again was a problem. The Bureau of Prisons reported the
Atlanta pen had less than 10 percent of all federal prisoners, but
almost 20 percent of all assaults on inmates or guards.
   The Cubans frequently protested prison conditions but more often
complained that they were being detained at all. The final uprising
was triggered by word that deportations to Cuba would resume.

   Linda Serrano is philosophical when she talks
about the bureaucracy of the U.S. Immigration And Naturalization
Service, but there's an underlying current of anger in her voice.
   ``I've tried and tried to find out why they won't let Manuel
come home but so far nobody has explained it in a way that makes
sense,'' she said in an interview.
   Her common-law husband, 46-year-old Manuel Casalis Noy, an
inmate at the federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., is one of some
1,100 Cubans in federal detention who have been approved for parole
but are still awaiting release.
   Jorge Figueiras has been paroled. But his wife, Reyna Ordonez,
still fears he might be deported because of the damage done by the
Cubans during the uprisings last fall at prisons in Atlanta and
Oakdale, La.
   ``The United States is not going to let this go by,'' said
Ordonez. ``Some way, I think they'll make them pay.''
   Casalis Noy arrived in this country in the 1980 Mariel boatlift
and later served eight months in a California prison for possession
of cocaine. When his time was up, however, the INS sent him to the
federal penitentiary in Atlanta, where some 1,400 other Cubans with
criminal records waited to learn what lay in store for them.
   ``Manuel was brought to Atlanta in December 1985, and we came
here from California, three months later,'' said Serrano, who lives
with her two children from a previous relationship and works as a
nanny-housekeeper for an Atlanta family.
   While trying to get paroled, she said, her husband worked in
prison industries and kept out of trouble.
   ``He was sending us money, up to $100 a month there for a
while,'' she said. ``And we could see him every week. Then, last
November, he finally was approved for parole. Everything looked
great, I even had a job lined up for him.''
   Then came the riots. The Cubans detained in Atlanta and Oakdale
were moved to prisons throughout the country.
   ``That messed everything up,'' Serrano said. ``But when I
finally tracked Manuel down in late December I was told he was
going to have to go to a halfway house somewhere.''
   Serrano said she began trying to get her man sent home instead.
After numerous dead-ends, she said, she reached a Bureau of Prisons
official working with the INS in Washington, D.C.
   ``She told me Manuel couldn't come home because he was on the
list to go a halfway house,'' Serrano said. ``But I told her I had
made a good home here and that I know a lot of detainees are being
sent home and they did crimes a lot worse than Manuel did. Besides,
there's a long wait to get into the halfway houses.''
   In the six months since the riots, the INS has sent hundreds of
detainees home. Some, like Mario Ochoa, were paroled within a few
weeks of their interviews by a two-person INS panel.
   Ochoa, who served 26 months for possession of a dangerous weapon
with intent to use it, said he was released and sent home to
Brooklyn, N.Y., just three weeks after his interview.
   He credited his quick release to his wife's contacts with
congressmen and reporters.
   He said he was puzzled that some Cubans convicted of lesser
crimes remain behind bars. INS officials refuse to discuss the
cases of individual detainees with reporters.
   Figueiras was transferred to a federal facility in Kansas City,
Kan., after the riot. He has since been released to a halfway house
and now has his own apartment in a Kansas City suburb, his wife
says.
   Figueiras must serve his eight-month parole in the area. Ordonez
has sent two of her children to be with him and says she will make
the trip with her remaining two children when she saves enough
money.
   ``It's good news that he's out, but right now we're going
through hard times,'' she said.
   Ordonez is the only one who remains of a small group of Cuban
women who had moved to Oakdale to be near their husbands and
relatives inside the prison.
   ``The people here (in Oakdale), they still don't like us,'' she
said. ``My older kids, they were always crying, `We want to leave
here.'
   ``For me, I'm still afraid,'' she said. ``The small children
play together, but I stay inside by myself.
   ``If I had the money in my hand I'd be gone right now.''

<TEXT>
   Fourteen-year-old Noorieh Mazloumpoor
has had two educations in her young life _ one Moslem, the other
Marxist.
   She got her Marxist education in her homeland, Afghanistan.
   As a refugee with her family in Pakistan for the past two years,
her education has been based on Islam, her religion.
   She is typical of Afghan children who have been taught two
conflicting ideologies over the past decade of war in their country.
   Now with the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, the
children who have had an Islamic education in Pakistan will be
returning home to join those whose education was wholly Marxist.
   The gap may be wide, but students interviewed here were
confident it won't deter them from reuniting their country in the
long run.
   Noorieh went to school in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, until
she was 12.
   In Pakistan, she enrolled in a Moslem school run by the
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   Like many of her classmates, she has had to switch from courses
that taught Communist doctrine to interpretations of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book.
   In Kabul, she said, she was taught that it was her ``duty to
serve the country, the masses, the revolution and the fruits of
history.''
   At her refugee school in Peshawar, the blue cover of her Persian
language text book has a map identifying her country as ``Moslem
Afghanistan.'' Another map in the book carries the Koranic verse,
``There is no god but Allah. Mohammed is his prophet.''
   Refugee books published by the guerrillas' Afghan education
council also teach: ``The future of Afghanistan should be
reconstructed on the principles of Islamic culture.''
   ``Eventually we will have to reconcile the two,'' said
Ehsanollah Poopal, 17-year-old 10th grader.
   ``It's going to take a lot of effort, patience. They have their
reasons and we have ours.''
   Poopal, however, said he will not accept the Communist teachings
and will try to explain to his classmates back home why his beliefs
are different.
   Another refugee student, 15-year-old Mehrafsa, said he thinks it
is going to be difficult in the beginning.
   ``We are going to suffer first, especially to see our friends
are led toward a corrupt path, taught bad values. But I don't think
it will be too long before we understand each other. I don't think
the gap will affect the country in the long run.''
   Wassimeh, 24, a teacher at one of the refugee schools, believes
Moslem education will continue when the children among the 3
million refugees in Pakistan return home.
   Maliheh Malekzad, 28, an mathematics teacher, said she taught at
a Kabul school until two years ago. She added that unless a teacher
was a member of the Communist Party, there was no hope of promotion.
   ``It is very difficult for a Moslem not to be able to express
her religious viewpoint and to be taunted for her belief,'' she
said.
   Schools in Afghanistan, according to the teachers and students
here, have their own party recruitment bodies _ the scouts, the
first stage of Communist ``indoctrination,'' and the youth
organization, where Russian culture and language are taught, and
where some are given schoolarships to study in the Soviet Union.
   The third stage is the older youth organization where advanced
Communist books are read outside the school curriculum.
   Ms. Malekzad said the refugee schools here are good at teaching
theories but poor in practical education.
   The walls and classrooms are adorned with guerrilla posters, and
during class, the students sing: ``I cry for my motherland, I cry
for its martyr. Wherever I turn, I see broken limbs.''
   But 9-year-old Godsiyeh Amir Mohammad said she likes studying
Islam because it will ``make me go to heaven.''

   Five months of Palestinian strikes and boycotts
have cost Israel $500 million in lost tourist income, uncollected
taxes and added military expenses, officials say.
   But Israeli analysts suggest the 1.5 million Arab residents of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip have suffered even more because they
depend on Israel for jobs and services.
   Gad Yaacobi, minister of economy, estimated the loss between
$500 million to $560 million, according to his spokeswoman, Naama
Henig.
   Riots, stay-at-home strikes, refusal to pay taxes and a boycott
of Israeli products have left their greatest mark on tourism, which
brought in $1.6 billion last year.
   ``The major damage is to the tourism industry. The estimate is
there will be a drop of several hundred million dollars in income
due to the image of Israel as a result of the uprising,'' said
Assaf Razin, professor of economy at Tel Aviv University.
   Tourism in March and April was down 23 percent from the first
two months of the year, and advance bookings have fallen. This is a
huge disappointment for officials who had hoped to reap a tourist
bonanza on Israel's 40th anniversary.
   To counter its bad image, Israel will spend $5 million on an
advertising campaign under the slogan ``Israel: See for Yourself.''
   ``The idea is Israel isn't just the West Bank, it's Masada,
Eilat, Jaffa oranges, all these wonderful things,'' said Al
Lieberman, president of New York-based Grey Advertising, one of the
companies involved in the campaign.
   Half the total cost has been putting additional manpower in the
field to handle the riots.
   The ceiling on reserve army duty was raised from 45 to 62 days
per year. Razin said the government will have to pay $100 million
to reserve soldiers, who are compensated for missing work.
   Yaacobi said the army spent $250 million for riot control, and
the police $94 million. He indicated this could weaken Israel's
defense posture.
   ``It is clear that we will not be able to absorb for long sums
of hundreds of millions of shekels without this badly damaging the
readiness of both the forces,'' Yaacobi said on army radio.
   Razin said the uprising that began Dec. 8, known as the
``intefadeh,'' has not had the same economic impact as Israel's
three-year Lebanon occupation, which cost $1.6 billion to $2
billion and fueled runaway inflation of more than 400 percent.
   ``The economic aspects of the intefadeh have not been that
devastating or costly enough visibly to change Israeli attitudes,''
Razin said in an interview.
   Eitan Berglas, chairman of the Bank Hapoalim, which is
affiliated with Israel's labor movement, said the loss to Israel's
economy this year would be be 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the gross
national product of $25 billion.
   Berglas said the rising costs of governing the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip could affect Israeli thinking about the need to
keep the land seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``If Israelis are persuaded there will be no return to the
situation as it was before the uprising and if big expenditures
continue, it may convince people of the need to compromise about
the territories,'' he said.
   But Berglas said the question was whether the economic burden
would have an impact before November when national elections are
scheduled.
   In recent years, Israel has been profiting financially from
trade with the occupied territories. In 1987, the surplus was $491
million.
   Also declining are tax collections that fund the army-run Civil
Administration, which governs the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``It's starting to be significant. We have a shortage of
money,'' said a senior official in the Civil Administration which
runs schools, hospitals and utilities in the occupied lands.
   ``We are trying to protect the most vital services, such as
hospitals, but a shortage of money means a shortage of service,''
said the official, who demanded anonymity.
   To collect taxes, which fund the Civil Administration's $320
million budget, the army has set up surprise checkpoints on the
highways in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Soldiers use portable computers to check whether motorists have
paid taxes. Palestinian journalists say some cars, trucks and cargo
have been seized if taxes have not been paid.
   An army economist in the Civil Administration predicted the $1.4
billion GNP of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would decline by as
much as $100 million if the unrest continued. Razin predicted the
loss could be several hundred million.
   ``In terms of relative magnitude, there's a very big impact in
the territories while on the Israeli side it is manageable,'' said
Razin.
   The greatest impact has been on the 110,000 Arabs laborers who
hold jobs in Israel. About 20 percent have been kept off the job
and others have lost income because of PLO-called general strikes
or army-imposed curfews.
   ``The fact is the Palestinian worker needs Israel more than
Israel needs him,'' said the army economist, who demanded anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The surprise reconciliation between
Morocco and Algeria ending more than 12 years of often bloody
hostility is expected to help next month's Arab summit and further
the cause of North African unity.
   A communique issued simultaneously in Rabat and Algiers on
Monday announced the decision to re-establish full diplomatic
relations immediately and to reactivate all past agreements,
including a 19-year-old treaty of friendship and cooperation.
   Transport and communications links between the two countries are
to be restored without delay.
   The communique stressed the determination of the two North
African Arab neighbors to cooperate toward ``Maghreb,'' or North
African, unity and toward solving all bilateral and regional
problems including the dispute over the Western Sahara which has
repeatedly brought them to the brink of war.
   The announcement followed months of secret high-level diplomatic
contacts between the two governments and strong pressure from other
Arab countries to put an end to their dispute.
   The joint communique said nothing about the concessions believed
to have been made by the two sides concerning the Western Sahara _
the root of their quarrel.
   Morocco annexed Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, in
1975. It was Algeria's military, financial, logistic and diplomatic
support for a guerrilla group in the territory, the Polisario
Front, that led to the break in relations in March 1976.
   Hours before the communique was issued, Polisario's Algiers
headquarters claimed the guerrillas had launched an attack on
Moroccan troops in the desert and killed 20 of them. Morocco
refused to confirm or deny the report.
   In its first comment on the reconciliation, the Polisario Front
said it was ``determined to pursue its legitimate struggle for the
conquest of sovereignty over all its national territory.''
   The statement said the guerrilla group approved any move toward
lessening tension and creating the ``greater Maghreb'' but added:
   ``The only just and definitive solution is the recognition of
the national rights of the Saharan state.''
   Algeria had hitherto insisted that relations could only be
restored between the two governments after Morocco agreed to open
direct talks with the Polisario leadership.
   But King Hassan consistently rejected such talks on the grounds
that this would prejudge the result of a proposed referendum in the
disputed territory.
   Polisario, for its part, has insisted the 160,000 Moroccan
troops and administrators be replaced by an international
peacekeeping force prior to any vote.
   Tuesday marked the third day of a major feast ending the Moslem
holy month of Ramadan, and most senior officials were unreachable
in both countries.
   The Moroccan government paper, Le Matin du Sahara, sought to
dispel speculation that Algeria agreed to resume relations only to
ensure the participation of King Hassan II of Morocco in the Arab
summit meeting scheduled to begin June 7 in Algiers.
   King Hassan said earlier he would not attend the summit while
Morocco had no diplomatic relations with Algeria.
   ``The resumption of diplomatic relations is far from a simple
arrangement of convenience on the eve of an Arab summit,'' the
paper said. ``The creation of a greater Maghreb ... is a vital
necessity for the Arab and African peoples.''
   Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi hailed the
reconciliation Tuesday and said that ``in the immediate your
decision will have a positive effect'' on the summit.
   In Washington, the State Department hailed the renewed
diplomatic links.
   ``It's a positive step for both countries and for the North
Africa region,'' said State Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   The restoration of relations between Algeria and Morocco removed
the greatest obstacle preventing further North African unity,
however, and the joint communique said this was the objective of
both governments.
   Algeria is linked in a regional friendship and cooperation
treaty to Tunisia and Mauritania. Each of the three countries has a
veto over the possible extension of the treaty, and Tunisia has
long blocked Algerian efforts to include Libya because such action
would leave Morocco isolated in North Africa.
   Although the joint communique gave no hint of progress toward a
solution of the Western Sahara dispute, it seemed to open the way
to the possible five-nation North African community that has long
been a professed goal of all the governments involved.

   Perry Mason won another case and helped NBC win
the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings last week, part of the important May
sweeps period.
   NBC's average, prime-time rating for the week that ended Sunday
was 14.7 and its share was 26. ABC was second with a 12.8 and 22
share. CBS had an 11.4 average rating and 20 share. NBC's
season-to-date rating average is 15.8. ABC has 13.5 and CBS 13.3.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   Raymond Burr's latest stint as the ever-victorious defense
attorney topped the Nielsens. Not far behind were a Barbara Walters
special on ABC and ABC's miniseries ``The Bourne Identity''
starring Richard Chamberlain.
   May is one of four months when local stations' ratings are
measured for use in negotiating advertising rates, so the networks
put on a lot of special programming to draw viewers to affiliates.
   ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Lady in the Lake'' was the No.
1-rated prime-time network show of the week with a rating of 22.6
and a 35 share. NBC said it was the network's best Sunday movie
rating all season.
   In addition to ``Bourne'' and the usual series, ABC also made
the top 10 with the theatrical film ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' and NBC
added to the top 10 part two of its sci-fi miniseries ``Something
Is Out There.''
   CBS, shut out of the top 10, came in 11th with the season-ending
episode of ``Knots Landing.'' But part one of its big miniseries of
the week, ``Beryl Markham: A Shadow on the Sun,'' fared poorly
against ``Perry Mason'' and came in 43rd with a rating of 10.4.
   The top 10-rated shows were: ``Perry Mason'' NBC, ``The Cosby
Show'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Beverly Hills Cop'' ABC, ``Barbara
Walters Special'' ABC, ``Night Court'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC,
``Something Is Out There, Part 2'' NBC, ``The Bourne Identity, Part
2'' ABC and ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``I Married
Dora,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Uncommon Valor,'' ``West 57th,'' ``High
Mountain Rangers,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Aaron's Way,'' ``Houston
Knights,'' ``Ohara'' and ``Supercarrier.''
   For the week that ended Friday, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was
first in the ratings for the third week in a row. It had a 9.4
rating and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' was second with 9.1
and 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' continued to trail with an 8.0 and 17
share.
   ABC said that it had calculated an 11 percent share increase for
``World News'' this quarter compared to the period last year. CBS
was down 9 percent in share, and NBC down 18 percent, ABC said.

   First-place NBC is not making wholesale changes
in its prime-time lineup for the fall, but is adding eight new
shows, including a promising series set in a sophisticated New York
restaurant from the producers of the critically acclaimed ``St.
Elsewhere.''
   Besides ``St. Elsewhere,'' which the producers chose to end
after this season, NBC is eliminating eight series: ``The Facts of
Life,'' ``Crime Story,'' ``A Year in the Life,'' ``Our House,''
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' ``Beverly Hills Buntz,''
``The Bronx Zoo'' and ``Aaron's Way.''
   Replacement series ``Day by Day'' and ``In the Heat of the
Night'' made the cut. So did the 4-season-old ``Miami Vice,'' which
had been a question mark.
   ``Highway to Heaven'' and ``My Two Dads'' are not on the fall
schedule, but are still in production and will return as specials
or replacement series, according to NBC.
   NBC plans to start the season on Sept. 19 despite the strike by
the Writers Guild of America, which already has forced CBS to
announce it will start late. NBC opens with prime-time coverage of
the Summer Olympics, followed soon thereafter by the World Series.
ABC also is expected to announce it will delay the start of its
season. ABC and CBS are expected to announce their fall lineups
later this month.
   NBC is adding these new shows:
   _``Tattinger's,'' starring Stephen Collins as a popular New York
restaurant owner who moves in powerful circles. It co-stars Blythe
Danner, Mary Beth Hurt and Jerry Stiller.
   _``Something Is Out There,'' based on the the high-rated recent
sci-fi miniseries, starring Joe Cortese as a cop and Maryam D'Abo
as the extraterrestrial who helps him track down a killer from
outer space.
   _``Midnight Caller,'' starring Gary Cole as an ex-cop cult hero
with a late-night radio talk show.
   _``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which has been a series of specials
this season. Real-life crimes or mysteries are re-enacted.
   _``Baby Boom,'' based on the movie of the same name in which a
high-powered career woman suddenly finds herself saddled with an
infant. Kate Jackson stars.
   _``Dear John,'' starring Judd Hirsch as a married man suddenly
abandoned by his wife, based on the BBC series of the same name.
   _``Empty Nest,'' the semi-spinoff of ``Golden Girls,'' starring
Richard Mulligan as a recently widowed pediatrician living in the
``Girls''' neighborhood in Miami.
   _``The Magic World of Disney,'' a rotation series based on
Disney movie projects, including ``The Absent-Minded Professor,''
starring Harry Anderson, ``Davy Crockett,'' and an action-adventure
series to be announced.
   Here is the NBC prime-time lineup for next season:
   Monday: ``ALF,'' ``The Hogan Family'' (formerly ``Valerie's
Family''), ``NBC Monday Night at the Movies.''
   Tuesday: ``Matlock,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Midnight
Caller.''
   Wednesday: ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``Night Court,'' ``Baby
Boom,'' ``Tattinger's.''
   Thursday: ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Cheers,''
``Dear John,'' ``L.A. Law.''
   Friday: ``Sonny Spoon,'' ``Something Is Out There,'' ``Miami
Vice.''
   Saturday: ``227,'' ``Amen,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest,''
``Hunter.''
   Sunday: ``The Magical World of Disney,'' ``Family Ties,'' ``Day
by Day,'' ``NBC Sunday Night at the Movies.''

   Kaye Ballard's singing is tuneful and can sound
deeply felt, tender and poignant. But in her new off-Broadway show
she emphasizes her talent to amuse _ and that's rarer than the
ability to sing.
   There are jokes and impressions scattered through ``Kaye
Ballard: Working 42nd Street at Last,'' which opened on that
street's the Kaufman Theater Monday night. But she dived in at the
beginning with funny songs.
   ``Don't Ask the Lady What the Lady Did Before,'' the opener by
composer Cy Coleman, has witty, double entendre lyrics by Carolyn
Leigh. Miss Ballard followed that with ``Sondheim Song,'' which
announces that she won't sing a New York cabaret act's obligatory
song by Stephen Sondheim, whilst quoting liberally from Sondheim.
   She immediately plunged several levels of sophistication by
singing in praise of ``My Son,'' who's a stripper, and ``Burger
Beguine,'' which lists fast-food joints from the Champs Elysees to
the Apian Way.
   Kidding aside, Miss Ballard also sang some lovely songs,
including Jerome Kern's ``Remind Me''; a tastefully chosen medley
of Irving Berlin songs, sung with a throb and a beautiful tone and
a very occasional big ending; ``Yellow Flower,'' on which she
surprised by playing flute, and ``Young at Heart,'' sung with sweet
gentleness.
   The audience resumed laughing as she trashed ``Is That All There
Is?'', pushed her nose down with her finger to act out ``I Just
Kissed My Nose Goodnight'' and let Cole Porter's ``Tale of the
Oyster'' reveal its own wit without overselling it.
   Arthur Siegel, who composed several songs for Broadway's ``New
Faces of 1952,'' played piano for Miss Ballard and sang several
duets with her. He also soloed on his own ``Love Is a Simple
Thing.''
   All cabaret shows seek to lift listeners on wings of song. Miss
Ballard's also lifts one with laughter.

   The government confirmed that a man killed
April 28 was the leader of the terrorist Secret Army for the
Liberation of Armenia.
   ``The man was Agop Agopian. He was identified by some
disfigurements on his body and his wife's testimony,'' Public Order
Minister Antonis Drossoyiannis told reporters at a news briefing on
Tuesday.
   Agopian was killed by a masked gunman outside his home in
Athens' Old Phaleron suburb. No group has claimed responsibility
for the killing.
   The Secret Army, founded by Agopian in 1975, seeks the
establishment of an independent Armenian state in eastern Turkey
and vengeance for what it claims was the massacre of 1.5 million
Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1916.

<HEAD>10 Dallas Postal Workers Arrested for Trafficking Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Postal inspectors arrested 10 employees for
drug trafficking through the Dallas Main Post Office Tuesday night,
following a nine-month undercover investigation.
   Postal Inspector Jim Travell said authorities are still looking
for two more employees who were indicted for selling and
distributing marijuana and cocaine at the postal processing center.
   ``The indictments were handed down by a Dallas grand jury and
charged each postal worker with selling drugs to agents who worked
in an undercover capacity at the facility,'' said Travell, of Fort
Worth.
   Sealed indictments were handed down April 28, Travell said, but
they were not unsealed until Tuesday to allow authorities time to
organize the arrests.
   Those arrested are mail handlers or processors and distribution
clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the
Dallas facility, Travell said.
   ``They worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe
there was a conspiracy between them,'' Travell said.
   The employees, who have one to 10 years experience with the
postal service, were arrested for selling between a quarter-ounce
to several pounds of marijuana or between a half-gram to a
quarter-ounce of cocaine in any one sale to the undercover
officers, Travell said.
   ``The largest sale we did was $1,000,'' Travell said. ``Most of
them ranged from $25 to $1,000 a sale. The jist of the
investigation was dealers, not users.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Webster of Dallas said the employees
face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of
$150,000 to $200,000.
   Travell said inspectors were alerted to a drug trafficking
problem among the 4,000 workers at the facility by employees.
   ``Fellow employees are starting to be fed-up with this type of
behavior,'' Travell said.

   The Dorchester, one of London's most exclusive
hotels, will close in December for more than a year for a $134
million facelift.
   It will be the first closure in the hotel's 57-year history.
   The hotel, situated in Park Lane, was bought for $80 million
three years ago by the world's richest man, the Sultan of Brunei,
who pledged to make it the most luxurious in the world.
   A hotel spokesman said on Tuesday that major improvements
include an Oriental restaurant, a nightclub, a health club and news
conference rooms. The kitchens, plumbing and electrical system also
are to be upgraded.
   The hotel will close on Dec. 23 and reopen sometime in the
spring of 1990.

<HEAD>Dancer Talks About His Stabbing During A Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta Ballet dancer recuperating from an
accidental stabbing during a performance of ``Romeo and Juliet''
said he still believes real swords and knives should be used in the
production.
   ``You need it for effect,'' said Richard McLeod. ``It makes you
pay attention a lot more, because you realize there is that element
of danger, and if you don't do what you're supposed to do, you
could get hurt.''
   Ballet officials also defended the use of real weapons but said
they would not try to repeat the stabbing stunt that left McLeod
with a punctured lung during Friday night's performance.
   A protective shield had been sewn into McLeod's costume so he
could be dramatically stabbed in the back with a 3-inch serrated
knife. But the shield had shifted out of place.
   ``Usually, (dancer George Prieto) stabs me and leaves the knife
in there. But he said he felt something was wrong, and he pulled it
back out _ and I fell on the ground,'' said the 20-year-old McLeod,
who is recovering at Georgia Baptist Hospital.
   Atlanta Ballet President Kenneth T. Hertz said the clinking and
scraping of real swords is a vital part of a ``major league''
production.
   ``There's nothing that can really duplicate that sound,'' he
said. ``The performers can really go at it a little bit more
strongly, because it's equipment that was designed for that, not
equipment that was designed to look like it was designed for that.''
   Robert Barnett, artistic director of the ballet company, said it
is commonplace for dancers to use real swords. But, he said of the
stabbing scene during the ballet by Sergei Prokofiev, ``We'll never
do that sort of action again, because it's just not worth taking
the chance.''
   Tom Pazik, who choreographed the production, said he will change
the stabbing scene if he stages the ballet again, probably using a
retractable blade.

   An actress who drowned last month
off the east coast of England killed herself because she was
depressed over the loss of her savings in the October stock market
crash, according to an inquest.
   Coroner Rebecca Cobb on Tuesday recorded a suicide verdict in
the case of Robin Ross, who used the stage name Wendy Ross and had
appeared on several U.S. television shows, including ``Dallas'' and
``Charlie's Angels.''
   Miss Ross' mother, Virginia, testified that her 33-year-old
daughter had come back to Britain and had ``changed completely''
after losing her money. She reportedly lost $185,000.
   ``She meant for the money she lost to be hers to live on,'' said
Mrs. Ross. ``She hated the thought of being a burden to me.''
   She said her daughter, who had been living in Canada at the time
of the October crash, kept telling her mother she felt poor.
   On April 11, Miss Ross drove to a beach near Broadstairs, swam
out to sea ignoring shouts from passersby and drowned.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today told President
Joaquim Alberto Chissano of Mozambique that China went through a
20-year period of stagnation before leftist mistakes were corrected
in the late 1970s.
   Deng, 83, in opening remarks to Chissano, said China's troubles
began in 1957, the year Mao Tse-tung launched a repressive
anti-rightist movement and the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous
experiment in rapid industrialization.
   He said those mistakes led to the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, when the nation was torn apart by purges and violent
battles between rival leftist groups.
   Deng, who was purged three times during those two decades, rose
to power in the late 1970s. He has introduced pragmatic political
policies and market-oriented economic reforms which have
dramatically improved the living conditions of most Chinese.
   Chissano arrived in China on Monday for a four-day state visit,
his first since assuming office in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Almost everybody had an opinion _ usually a
vehement one _ about the ``Baby M'' case, in which Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould reneged on her promise to give William and
Elizabeth Stern the baby she bore as a surrogate mother.
   The case was decided only last year, and it's already a
made-for-television movie, airing Sunday and Monday on ABC. The
four-hour ``docudrama'' is based on court transcripts and published
accounts of the landmark case and is remarkably fair-minded,
considering the emotionally volatile subject. It was written and
directed by James Sadwith (``Bluffing It'').
   JoBeth Williams is perfect as Mary Beth, a New Jersey mother of
two married to a garbage collector. Rick Whitehead is played as a
sturdy, loyal, salt-of-the-earth type by Bruce Weitz.
   When Mary Beth decides, seemingly selflessly, that she'd like to
help an infertile couple, she is introduced to the well-educated,
well-off Sterns _ he a biochemist, played by John Shea; she a
pediatrician, played by Robin Strasser.
   For those familiar with the case, it may be difficult to watch
the two couples waltzing merrily into what will become an
unbearable situation. At one point, the Sterns are offered the
opportunity to remain anonymous, but they insist on meeting Mary
Beth, and they even socialize with the Whiteheads.
   If the miniseries falls to one side or the other, it is to Mary
Beth's, especially in the first half when she screams all night for
the child she has been forced to give away.
   William Stern, who frequently whines that he has ``no one,''
must rely for sympathy on Shea's portrayal, and it works, because
no one could despise those cocker spaniel eyes. But the movie does
show Stern to be caring enough to give the baby back _ temporarily,
he believes _ when Mary Beth appears so distraught he thinks she
might commit suicide. For her part, Elizabeth Stern comes off every
bit the ``ice princess'' Mary Beth calls her.
   Mary Beth drags her husband and the couple's two children along
on her emotional roller coaster. She and Rick flee in a vain effort
to keep the baby Mary Beth has named Sara. The filmmakers set some
scenes to the Starship song, ``Sara'': ``Sara, Sara, storms are
brewin' in your eyes. Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for
good-bye ...''
   The Sterns go to court to get the baby back. The judge seals the
case ``to shield the child from publicity and notoriety.'' Little
did he know it would become a network miniseries.
   Mary Beth finally calls Bill Stern from the road and says she
wants to resolve the situation, but she also threatens to kill
herself and the baby. Stern, unbeknown to her, is taping the call,
and it will become a bombshell in the trial to come.
   The pawn in all of this is, of course, the infant, andthe film
makes that point in one poignant scene as Rick and a sheriff's
deputy grapple for the child as the camera captures her terrified
expression.
   The second half of the movie is taken up with the court battle.
In one of the odd bit parts he seems to like, Dabney Coleman plays
the Sterns' lawyer. Anne Jackson has a small part, too, as the
attorney appointed to represent the child.
   At the trial, Mary Beth's duplicity and instability are
revealed, and Betsy Stern, it is learned, is not infertile, though
she faced the risk of aggravating her multiple sclerosis if she
became pregnant.
   Stern makes some vague protests about ``father's rights.'' But
it is Mary Beth's lawyer, played by Bruce McGill, who gets the big
speech:
   ``I tell this court,'' he says, ``there is nothing more
fundamentally repugnant than to permit a man to have one woman to
share his life and another to experience the sacrifice and pain of
pregnancy and a lifetime of suffering as a result of separation
from her child. It will always be the wife of the sanitation worker
who will bear children for the pediatrician.''
   The movie ends with the judge giving custody of Baby M to the
Sterns. A scroll updates with the results of the appeal: the New
Jersey Supreme Court ruled the surrogacy contract illegal. The
Sterns have custody of the baby they named Melissa, but Mary Beth,
now married to another man and mother of their newborn son, has
visitation rights.
   The big question has always been how Melissa Stern will feel
about all this when she's old enough to understand it. It's a
tribute to Sadwith and crew that this movie would give her a pretty
good idea of how adults' good intentions can go wrong _ and how
much they all loved a baby girl.

   Fire swept through a Soviet passenger ship
in this western Japanese port early Wednesday, killing 10 people
and injuring 35, the fire bureau said. Many of those aboard were
Soviet students and workers.
   Ten bodies were recovered from the docked 4,870-ton Priamurye,
most from a still smoldering section of a passenger cabin, the last
about 10 hours after the blaze broke out, said Toshio Yabuno of the
Osaka City Fire Bureau.
   He said the victims' identities and nationalities were not known.
   White smoke billowed from the ship as fire squads pumped water
into the lower decks. Firefighters wearing oxygen masks plunged
through the smoke to rescue people trapped aboard the ship.
   Thirty-five people were injured in the pre-dawn blaze, most from
smoke inhalation, said Yabuno. He said 28 of the injured were taken
to hospitals and the seven others were treated at the port area for
minor burns or bruises.
   The cause of the fire was not known, said Yoshiaki Kataoka of
the Maritime Safety Agency's regional headquarters in Okobe. The
agency was informed of the blaze about 1:50 a.m. (12:50 p.m. EDT
Tuesday), he said.
   Kataoka said many of the passengers were Soviet students and
workers visiting Japan on a tour organized by the Communist Youth
League.
   The ship was carrying 295 passengers and 129 crew members when
it arrived Tuesday at Osaka, 255 miles west of Tokyo, Kataoka said.
   Firefighters temporarily stopped battling the blaze at one point
because water pumped into the lower decks had caused the ship to
list. The extra water was removed.
   Police cordoned off the area and ambulences sped to the dock.
   The Priamurye left Vladivostok on May 7 and made stops at Otaru,
on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and in Tokyo. On Thursday,
it was to have left for Hiroshima, the official said.
   Soviet consular officials took most passengers to a junior high
school gymnasium.
   The worst ship disaster in recent years involving a Soviet
cruise vessel occurred on Aug. 31, 1986, when the Admiral Nakhimov
sank in the Black Sea after colliding with the freighter Pyotr
Vasyev, with the loss of 398 lives.
   Both captains were sentenced to 15-year prison terms.
   On Feb. 16, 1986, the 20,000-ton Soviet cruise liner Mikhail
Lermonov slammed into rocks off New Zealand and sank. But although
the liner was carrying more than 700 passengers and crew, there was
only one fatality, a Soviet crew member.

   The United States and Israel are negotiating a
settlement after a two-year investigation into allegations Israel
tried to acquire U.S. technology illegally for cluster bombs, U.S.
officials say.
   ``We will not prosecute criminally,'' Justice Department
spokesman John Russell said Tuesday. ``We are in negotiations with
Israel,'' he said.
   Because the case is still open, Russell would not comment on why
the department has decided to forgo criminal prosecution. He also
refused to divulge the nature of the negotiations.
   But an official of the U.S. Customs Service, speaking on
condition he not be named, said this week there was a proposal to
issue administrative sanctions against Israel, possibly civil fines.
   An official at the Israeli Embassy did not return a telephone
call to discuss the case.
   The probe centered on allegations that Israel tried to obtain
from private American contractors the technology to produce cluster
bombs, which are canisters containing hundreds of smaller
high-explosive bomblets.
   The United States banned the export of cluster bombs to Israel
in 1982 after reports that Israel had used them in the invasion of
Lebanon, violating the stipulation that Israel use the bombs only
for self-defense.
   Specifically, investigators sought to determine if there were
any violations of the Arms Export Control Act, which stipulates
that certain military items can only be exported from the United
States with a license.
   U.S. officials said Israelis had approached Vector Corp. of
Marion, Iowa, with the proposal that the company's description of
technology be relabeled so it would not appear to be used in
producing explosive devices.
   Vector's high-speed machinery compresses and seals the hundreds
of little bombs in cluster bombs.
   Israeli officials denied any violations had occurred. They said
they developed their own ``minibombs'' placed in artillery shells,
and any American technology had been imported with valid licenses,
they said.
   In July 1986, subpoenas and search warrants were served at
Israel Military Industries in New York, whose 200 employees
negotiate military contracts with U.S. companies in spending $1.8
billion in military aid grants.
   The Justice Department withdrew the subpoenas after the Israeli
government said some of the officials were covered by diplomatic
immunity. In exchange, the Israelis agreed to cooperate with the
investigation.
   Subpoenas were also served on Vector Corp.; Bexco International
of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Assembly Machines Inc. of Erie, Pa.
Grand juries were impaneled in Erie and Cedar Rapids.
   Dan Schwartz, a lawyer for Vector, said he had no information
about the Justice Department's negotiations. ``We have received no
word for a fairly long period of time,'' he said.
   Officials at Assembly Machines, a manufacturing company, and
Bexco, an export-import firm, also said they had no information
about the case.

   A new Agriculture Department report says there
have been some dramatic changes in the mix of foods consumed by
Americans since 1970 but some inconsistencies, too.
   Of all the meat consumed in 1986, two-thirds was red meat,
mostly beef, pork and lamb, compared with three-fourths in the
early 1970s.
   ``Instead, we ate more poultry, fish, grains and cereal
products,'' the report said Tuesday. ``We also cut back on whole
milk, while consuming more low-fat milk and yogurt. Fresh fruit and
vegetable consumption rose as well.''
   But the report added: ``While there was a general shift toward
foods perceived as low in fat or calories, our cheese consumption
increased during the period. In addition, consumption rose for fats
and oils, frozen potatoes, and corn sweeteners and soft drinks.''
   And families ate fewer eggs and fresh potatoes and drank less
coffee during the 16-year period.
   Overall, the consumers responded to higher incomes, new food
production and marketing techniques, and changes in lifestyles.
   Consumption of red meat declined, but poultry more than took up
the slack. Total meat consumption, which includes poultry,
gradually crept higher.
   The report was prepared by a team in the department's Economic
Research Service and was included in the agency's quarterly
National Food Review.
   In the early '70s, the report said, Americans ate an average of
151 pounds of red meat annually per person, and about 49 pounds of
poultry. In 1986, red meat dropped to 140 pounds while poultry
averaged 72 pounds.
   ``Poultry's rise stemmed largely from retail prices that
remained well below those for red meats, primarily because of
savings passed on from the farm and processing levels,'' the report
said. ``As a result, poultry was used to a greater extent in frozen
entrees and convenience foods than red meats were.''
   But poultry's price advantage was not the only factor that
affected consumers. Cut-up birds and heavily advertised branded
items such as those of Holly Farms, Perdue, Louis Rich and Tysons
Foods gained popularity.
   Pan-ready or pre-cooked items, along with upscale raw products
such as boneless breast fillets, also attracted consumers.
Processors began offering chicken and turkey franks, turkey
breakfast sausages, and turkey ham and salami in an effort to cater
to consumer concerns about fat.
   ``Other food processors and retailers joined the move toward
value-added items,'' the report said. ``Dairy processors introduced
fresh and microwave pizzas, a variety of flavored and textured
yogurts, Mexican-flavored cheeses, fruit and onion-flavored cream
cheeses, upscale frozen dairy products, and ready-to-make quiche
mixtures.''
   Frozen vegetable processors developed new combinations, sauce
selections and single-serving products in microwave containers. And
supermarkets now have a wider variety of fresh produce than they
had in the '70s, and have become more convenenience oriented with
salad bars and soup kettles.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng has
reported outside earnings of at least $119,500 last year, virtually
unchanged since he joined the Reagan Cabinet in March 1986.
   The outside earnings were in addition to his annual Cabinet
salary, which was raised to $99,500 in February 1987.
   In fact, Lyng's Cabinet salary has increased at a faster clip
than his outside income indicated by the disclosure report, which
doesn't reveal specific financial figures.
   Lyng's salary when he took over USDA 26 months ago was $86,200 a
year. In January 1987, he and other federal workers got a 3 percent
cost-of-living increase, which boosted his salary to about $88,800
a year.
   A month later, in February 1987, Cabinet salaries were boosted
to their present level, $99,500 a year.
   According to the statement released on Tuesday, Lyng owns assets
worth at least $775,000, primarily in real estate investments and a
family seed business in Modesto, Calif. His 1987 outside income was
in the range of $119,500 to $260,000.
   Lyng's liabilities, secured by mortgages and home equity, are at
least $300,000, according to the report.
   Income, assets and liabilities are reported only in broad ranges
by the financial disclosure reports.
   When Lyng underwent Senate confirmation proceedings in March
1986, he reported 1985 assets of at least $775,000 and an income in
the range of $205,000 to $344,000. The 1985 income included $82,500
salary from his private consulting firm, which he sold after being
chosen for the USDA post.

   Farmers have indicated they will plant fewer
total acres of feed grains this spring, but an Agriculture
Department report says that total 1988 production may increase
because of greater corn acreage in high-yielding states.
   ``Production of feed grains is forecast at 219 million metric
tons, 2 percent above 1987's 215 million,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
   Besides corn, other feed grains include sorghum, oats and
barley. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4
bushels of corn.
   In a related report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said that by mid-May corn planting had advanced rapidly to
about 88 percent completed in the major producing states, matching
the fast pace of a year ago. Normally, only 66 percent of the
acreage is planted by May 15.

   A federal grand jury indicted an Iranian
graduate student Tuesday on charges he threatened the life of
President Reagan and other public officials in letters and
telephone calls.
   Mohammed Farhad Khorrami, 37, a student at Indiana University in
Bloomington, was indicted on four counts of threatening injury to
the president and two counts of telephone harassment.
   Khorrami is accused of threatening the Jewish National Fund
office in New York City during January and February. He also
allegedly threatened former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
Israeli officials and Jews in general.
   Khorrami is a doctoral student in economics and held a graduate
student teaching position in Bloomington from 1982-84, said
Gretchen Wolfram of the news bureau at Indiana University-Purdue
University at Indianapolis. He has taught in a joint program of the
universities since 1985, she said.
   Khorrami has applied for legal alien status under the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's amnesty program. He faces
penalties of more than five years in prison and up to $275,000 if
convicted, officials said.

<HEAD>McFarlane Says Reagan's Own Advisers Faulted Star Wars Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to pursue an
ambitious space shield against nuclear weapons came despite his own
top advisers' belief that the Star Wars system wouldn't work, says
former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane.
   McFarlane, giving his first public account of the origins of
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, told a congressional
committee Tuesday that the president apparently came up with the
idea on his own against the advice of McFarlane and other top
military officials.
   The idea that any technological system ``could so devalue the
nuclear threat'' from additional and more accurate Soviet
intercontinental missiles as to produce ``a no-nuclear world ... is
infeasible,'' he told the House Armed Services Committee.
   But McFarlane said the idea already has served the purpose he
originally saw for it _ forcing the Soviets to reconsider their
offensive missile buildup and to add to the pressures that brought
perestroika, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's restructuring of the Soviet
economy.
   McFarlane later told a reporter he had chosen to speak out on
the subject after remaining silent for five years because ``I've
become more despairing about the responsiveness of government to
people, and it's not going to get better until we put aside the
notion that the American people are too dumb to understand.''
   He said he feels ``guilty as a member of a community ... that
has not been very candid with the American people about their
safety.''
   McFarlane said he directed the military Joint Chiefs of Staff in
late 1982 to develop the idea of using U.S. technological
superiority for some kind of anti-missile defense. The idea was
``to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that we intended to redirect
our investment strategy to an area where we had the comparative
advantage,'' he said.
   The military chiefs came up with a proposal for a limited,
ground-based system, McFarlane said, but Reagan turned that limited
concept into a much more ambitious system which McFarlane had
recommended against.
   He said the president had been thoroughly briefed on the
problems of such a system: the risks of technical failure, the
suspicions that would be aroused among allies that the United
States was seeking only its own security, Soviet suspicions of U.S.
preparation for a first nuclear strike and the ``fiscal
extravagance'' involved.
   ``My approach was one ... based on a rather sober, conservative
judgment about technological risk, fiscal realities and traditional
allied strategy,'' he said in a brief interview. ``I was paid to
deal in the real world. Presidents are paid to inspire, to lead, to
have a vision that goes beyond the status quo.''
   When Reagan announced his idea for a space-based missile shield
in a March 1983 speech, members of the military establishment,
including then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, were flabbergasted because it so differed from
anything previously discussed.
   McFarlane, who now is at work on a book while at Georgetown
University's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said
the original idea for a defense system came in late 1982 from Adm.
James Watkins, then chief of Naval operations.
   ``The president never directed me to develop an SDI program,''
McFarlane said. ``I never heard from anyone (in the White House)
the guidance to do this,'' although he was aware Reagan had some
interest in anti-ballistic missile defense dating from before his
1980 election.
   In late 1982, the administration had lost several battles in
Congress over what kind of basing mode to use in deploying the MX
missile and was concerned that the United States was losing ground
to the Soviets in offensive weapons, he said.
   Adm. John M. Poindexter, then a National Security Council
deputy, came to him with Watkins' idea, and McFarlane told the
Joint Chiefs to develop the idea further, he said. The chiefs met
several times in January 1983, then at a Feb. 11 meeting summarized
their findings in a meeting with Reagan.
   ``The president interrupted, and said, `Are you telling me that
you believe as a body that we should consider whether defense could
make a greater contribution (to the strategic balance)?' And each,
in turn, answered yes,'' McFarlane recounted.
   ``But the military was talking about missiles,'' McFarlane said.
   ``How did that get changed into an Astrodome to protect the
population?'' asked committee chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   ``Basically, the president wanted to change it, Mr. Chairman,''
McFarlane answered. ``He said, `You must deal in the traditional
threat we have faced, and in military terms. My job is to lead, and
to try to evaluate what may be feasible technologically, and be
responsive to human beings.'... I don't fault him for it.''
   Estimates of the long-term cost of Reagan's space-based defense,
which could use a combination of orbiting satellites, space fired
rockets and laser beams to knock out Soviet missiles, range up to
as much as $1 trillion. Some $25 billion in research and
development money already has been approved. Deployment of a
rudimentary version to protect a few limited military targets is
envisioned as early as the mid 1990s.

   Legislation to overhaul the federal
government's minority business development program is moving
through Congress in response to the Wedtech bribery and
influence-peddling scandal.
   The measure approved Tuesday by the Senate Small Business
Committee is intended to insulate the program ``from the political
hijinks which have plagued it over the years,'' said committee
chairman Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   ``We don't want any more Wedtech scandals,'' he said.
   Bumpers cited the numerous bribery and influence-peddling
indictments stemming from the Wedtech Corp.'s successful attempts
to win no-bid contracts from the Reagan administration.
   The committee approved a fiscal 1989 reauthorization of Small
Business Administration programs at approximately the same funding
level as this year, $5.3 billion, with inflationary increases for
SBA salaries and expenses.
   But it also voted to change the rules under which certain
government procurement contracts are set aside for companies owned
and controlled by women and members of minority groups.
   Since there is no competitive bidding, the program has come
under sharp criticism and public scrutiny because of the Wedtech
case and other scandals.
   The Senate measure requires that companies show that 30 percent
of their business comes from competitive contracts outside the
program after five years to be eligible for new contracts in the
sixth year. The percentage remains the same in year six, but
increases to 50 percent for the seventh and eighth years of
participation. A House version of the bill also calls for a varying
mix of competitive contracts but only recommends that they be goals
and not requirements.
   Both versions provide that contracts can be terminated by the
government if the business is quickly transferred or sold; the
Senate bill applies that provision to the initial year of the
contract.
   The committee also approved amendments requiring a yearly
certification of ownership. Among the allegations in the Wedtech
case is that the company continued to seek the preferential SBA
contracts even though it was no longer minority-controlled.
   Wedtech, a South Bronx military contractor, was awarded more
than $250 million in no-bid contracts in just four years. It was
frequently cited by Reagan administration officials as a minority
business success story, but the bribery and influence-peddling
allegations subsequently led to five different state and federal
criminal investigations.
   Among those under indictment is E. Robert Wallach, a longtime
friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III. Meese has acknowledged
interceding on Wedtech's behalf on a no-bid Army contract, but he
denies any wrongdoing.

   A Wisconsin machinist celebrated his 33rd
birthday by quitting his job.
   But Tom Hall didn't make a rash decision _ at least not for
someone who won a $20 million lottery jackpot as a birthday
present, the second-largest lottery winning ever in Illinois.
   ``I am very, very happy, absolutely overwhelmed,'' Hall said
Tuesday.
   ``I took a personal day off work today, but I guess by tonight
they will realize I won't be going back to work,'' said the Racine
resident, who drove to Chicago with his father and lawyer to
present officials with his winning ticket from Saturday's 6 of 54
Lotto drawing.
   The windfall will not only allow him to quit his job, which pays
$9 to $10 an hour, but will give him more time to enjoy his
favorite pasttime, fishing. And it may lead to a new marital status.
   ``I realize this might change,'' the bachelor said.
   Hall said he wasn't yet sure how he would spend his winnings,
which will be spread over 20 years.
   He said he has played the Illinois lottery since it started in
1974, driving about 20 miles across the state line to buy $15 worth
of tickets every week. Wisconsin is starting its own lottery this
year.
   The largest single prize in the Illinois lottery was a $40
million payout in 1984.

   Down a dirt road, in the middle of a cow
pasture, people rummage through piles of clothes covering an acre
of land.
   But where did the clothing come from?
   ``Like the old saying, that's my business and not yours,'' said
Lee ``Red'' Wright, who owns the farm where the clothes are stored.
   Bargain-hunters climb atop the mounds of clothes that have been
piled in the pasture for about three weeks. They pay $5 to park,
then may haul off all the clothes they want for free, Wright said.
   Some said they found bargains, others said it was ``all junk.''
   Wright had little to say.
   ``It's good for people that's not too peculiar about what they
have,'' he said.
   He said he expects more shipments of clothes soon.
   ``There's some that's got tags on them. Whether they're new or
not, I don't know,'' he said. ``That's for you to judge for
yourself. I don't know, but they're good clothes, they're real good
clothes.''
   Anson County Sheriff Tommy Allen says he's been swamped with
questions, and is investigating.
   ``He's getting so much publicity that if it's not on the level,
he's sure enough going to have some problems,'' Allen said.

   After listening to a well-rehearsed pitch
from more than 100 schoolchildren, a House committee unanimously
approved legislation naming a long-extinct creature as
Pennsylvania's official state fossil.
   Armed with posters, a skit and speeches, second graders from
Valley Elementary School in Bensalem lobbied the House Committee on
Conservation to approve legislation Tuesday naming the phacops rana
as the state fossil.
   ``Phacops rana were kings of the ocean floor millions of years
ago,'' said 8-year-old Nicky Lepone, a spokesman for his 120
classmates.
   ``The phacops rana can be found in many areas of Pennsylvania,''
Lepone said, adding that the creature ``reminds us of Darth Vader
from `Star Wars.'''
   The committee passed the bill after committee Chairman Camille
George donned a scarf and sunglasses and toted an umbrella to help
the students demonstrate how fossils are formed by weather
conditions over millions of years. One of the children then
produced a fossilized phacops rana to show to the legislators.
   Teacher Tony O'Malley said his class discovered Pennsylvania
lacked a state fossil after a student heard a question about
another state's fossil on a television game show.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Considering Eastern Europe Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev may withdraw 50,000 to 100,000 troops from Eastern Europe
this year in a bid to win support for a new round of East-West
negotiations on conventional forces.
   A unilateral Soviet withdrawal of that scale would have ``little
impact strategically'' said a U.S official. But the political
payoff could be immense in Western Europe, where polls show great
enthusiasm for Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies.
   U.S. officials trying to anticipate Gorbachev's summit strategy
have also detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summit
meeting before Reagan leaves office in eight months. The projected
sites are Vienna or Budapest.
   Another summit would give the two sides more time to work on a
treaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 to 50
percent.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz acknowledged after making
final summit preparations last week in Geneva with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that ``it is now clear there is no
way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the
summit'' in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   The two sides, however, may use the Moscow summit to sign one
``protocol'' of the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, a
provision under which each side would notify the other of the time,
place and intended target of any planned missile tests, including
those from submarines, said one U.S. official.
   Because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit, U.S.
officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said they
foresee it as an event to consolidate improvements in U.S.-Soviet
relations since Gorbachev took office in 1985 and began the summit
meetings.
   At the same time, U.S. officials were preparing for possible
surprises.
   At Reykjavik in 1986, Gorbachev seized the initiative with
sweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons.
   This time, some U.S. officials said, Gorbachev may propose a 25
percent reduction in ground forces in Europe and opening
negotiations in Vienna in late fall.
   Pentagon and other estimates of NATO and Warsaw Pact troop
strengths vary widely _ from a 900,000-man edge for the East to a
200,000 Western edge.
   The Warsaw Pact has a decided lead in tanks and artillery. The
Pentagon estimates the Soviet-led alliance has 52,000 tanks
compared to 20,000 in NATO, and 43,000 artillery pieces compared to
NATO's 18,000.
   The Soviets keep 380,000 of their armored and motorized ground
troops at a high state of readiness in East Germany, 80,000 in
Czechoslovakia, and 40,000 in Poland, acording to the London-based
Institute for International Strategic Studies.
   Other U.S. officials said Gorbachev might postpone any
initiatives until after the Moscow summit, and afterwards cut troop
levels unilaterally.
   One U.S. official predicted 50,000 to 70,000 Soviet troops might
be withdrawn. Another U.S. official said as many as 100,000 Red
Army troops could be pulled back. Both officials spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Another veteran observer, former Defense Secretary Harold Brown,
forecast that Gorbachev might try to throw Reagan off balance at
the Moscow summit by announcing a unilateral withdrawal.
   Brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the Soviets
``move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front.''
   Gorbachev and his Warsaw Pact allies have been urging, for two
years, that the United States and the 15 other nations in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization began a new round of talks on
conventional arms.
   The earlier Mutual Balanced Force Reduction talks, which began
in 1973, failed to produce agreement even on the number of troops
in the opposing forces.
   Reagan administration officials believe a breakthrough may be
possible because Gorbachev seems to have accepted the Western
argument that the Warsaw Pact must make larger cuts than NATO to
redress its geographic and numerical advantages.
   ``The Soviets can afford to take significant cuts without
hurting their military capability,'' one U.S. official said. ``The
first U.S. objective is to get the Soviets down to NATO levels.''
   The Kremlin has also showed signs of addressing Western concerns
that the Soviet Union did not meet the human rights pledges it made
in the 1975 Helsinki accord.
   Senior U.S. officials said Shevardnadze told Shultz in Geneva
that his government would soon change its policies on religious
practices and religious education. Although he did not offer any
details, his statement was taken seriously by the U.S. side.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Even Good Economic News Might Not Boost GOP Votes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even good economic news doesn't seem to cheer
people up these days, and that could prove to be bad news for Vice
President George Bush.
   The latest example came Tuesday when the stock market declined
sharply _ after receiving news of a substantial improvement in the
latest trade figures.
   That bearish response to good tidings was enough to make Bush
wonder what it will take to get a favorable political bounce out of
an expanding economy.
   ``We have an economic situation any incumbent ought to just
dream about having,'' said Eddie Mahe, a Republican political
consultant not involved in any presidential campaign.
   But at the same time, he said, national polls are recording ``a
sense of unease, a sense that it's time for a change.''
   Consider the trade figures. The government reported that in
March, the trade deficit dropped more than $4 billion as exports
increased by 23 percent.
   When trade figures a month earlier showed an increase in the
deficit, the market dropped 101 points _ demonstrating the
readiness of investors to believe the worst. It was a disappointing
deficit report that triggered the 500-point market drop last
October.
   Yet, the reaction on Wall Street to good news on the trade front
was a drop of 21 points in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks.
   The same day the new trade figures came out, a CBS News-New York
Times poll said Democrat Michael Dukakis was leading Bush by 10
points in a national survey of 1,056 registered voters. A poll two
months earlier had the two candidates in a dead heat with Bush
favored by 46 percent and Dukakis by 45 percent.
   It certainly wasn't the economy that went sour for Bush in the
period between those surveys.
   Consider the recent statistics:
   __ The unemployment rate in April was 5.4 percent, the lowest
since June 1974.
   __ Business sales climbed 1.9 percent in March and construction
spending climbed 1.5 percent, the biggest increases in both areas
in a year.
   __ Even with recent increases in energy prices, the inflation
rate remains below 5 percent.
   Bush tried to brush off the latest poll by comparing it to
surveys that showed him running behind in New Hampshire just before
last winter's Republican primary.
   ``I was 8 points back and I won by 10,'' he told reporters in
California. ``They were off by 18 points.''
   ``I don't worry about it. The election is 5{ months away,'' he
said.
   But, of course, he worries about such statistics. Any politician
would.
   One theory common among Republican and Democratic political
analysts is that the administration's economic story is being
obscured by the attention received by the trials and tribulations
of Attorney General Edwin Meese III and by public concern over
whether Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega will be let off
the hook on drug charges.
   When Bush was asked if he thought the Meese and Noriega affairs
were contributing to his negative ratings in the polls, the vice
president replied, ``You may have put your finger on something
there.''
   But before going too far with the poll figures, it must be said
that such numbers six months before the election are not reliable
indicators of how people will vote in November.
   They are just a warning to Bush that things aren't going his way
at this early stage of the contest.
   They also reflect that because the race for the Republican
presidential nomination ended early, Dukakis has been much more in
the public eye for the past six weeks.
   Week after week, the Massachusetts governor is portrayed as the
victor over Jesse Jackson in yet another Democratic primary.
   As one GOP analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, put it,
``Every time Dukakis wins another primary, he grows an inch.''
   At the same time, Bush is coasting unopposed through those same
primaries, his victories getting only perfunctory notice from a
public knowing the suspense went out of the GOP race on Super
Tuesday.
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart said Bush is suffering because on
the Republican side ``there wasn't enough of a campaign, so there
wasn't enough of a dialogue.'' He said voters never reached the
point of getting a clear view of Bush.
   That problem should be dissipated when the battle is truly
joined in the fall, when voters get a chance to compare Bush and
Dukakis as the men between whom they must choose when they vote for
president. Dissipated, that is, if Bush finally escapes Reagan's
shadow and is able to convince voters that he is strong enough to
lead.
   As for the bearish attitude of the country, analysts in both
major parties use the same terms.
   Richard Wirthlin, Reagan's pollster, has said that his surveys
show Bush is behind at this point and that they also show most
Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction.
   ``There's a lot of apprehension,'' said Hart. A common attitude,
he said, is: ``Today's okay, but I'm worried about tomorrow.''

   Folks in this quiet, wealthy
community say they don't mind having a wealthy celebrity like
Whitney Houston as a neighbor. But they do mind her home
improvement plan.
   Houston, who was born in Newark about 30 miles away, bought the
5-acre estate in the heart of fox-hunting country last summer and
began installing a swimming pool, sound studio and tennis courts in
the fall, said township officials.
   Residents are complaining that the construction trucks have
caused disruptions by being parked illegally, said Ruth Kollmer,
who lives four houses away.
   However, police have gone to the site several times and found no
parking violations, Police Chief F. Herbert Herron said Tuesday.
   The 24-year-old singer has missed much of the flap because she's
been on a European tour since mid-April.

   Actor Judge Reinhold says people
shouldn't worry about the beating he gets at the hands of a girl in
a music video being taped this week with country music singer Jo-El
Sonnier.
   The video, which will accompany Sonnier's song ``Tear-Stained
Letter,'' is meant as a lighthearted version of the serious movie
``Fatal Attraction,'' Reinhold says.
   ``It's a comic look at how violent romance can be. I'm pretty
much brutalized and beat up and victimized by a beautiful girl,''
Reinhold said.
   Reinhold is best known for his appearances in the movie comedies
``Ruthless People,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High.''
   Sonnier's song ``No More One More Time'' from the album
``Jo-El'' is in the top 10 of the country music charts.
   The two became friends in Los Angeles several years ago.

   Camera in hand, singer Eddy Arnold paid a
surprise visit to the elementary school he attended more than half
a century ago.
   Arnold, who grew up in the area, appeared in principal Robert
Morrison's office and introduced himself, then toured the school
and took snapshots.
   ``He stayed about an hour and related a lot of stories from when
he went to school here,'' Morrison said.
   The principal said the 70-year-old singer got teary-eyed Friday
when he peeked into the sixth-grade classroom where he'd been a
student.
   ``We had a real nice visit,'' Morrison said. ``We felt honored.
It makes you feel good to know somebody famous like that has such
good memories of your school.''

   Sen. Bill Armstrong, putting his pony
where his mouth is, has paid off a Super Bowl bet with Virginia
Sen. John Warner by donating a wild bronco pony to a local Boy
Scout troop.
   The senator from Colorado had backed the hapless Denver Broncos
in January's National Football League championship, while fellow
Republican Warner wagered on the Washington Redskins, who won 42-10.
   Warner put up a supply of Virginia ham and peanuts for his side
of the bet, while Armstrong ventured a wild bronco, to be donated
to a Colorado troop in Warner's name.
   ``As it turns out, Senator Warner was right about the outcome of
the Super Bowl ... this time around, anyway,'' Armstrong said
Tuesday.
   The bronco was brought from the Western rangelands by the
federal Bureau of Land Management. Armstrong paid a $125 ``adoption
fee'' for the pony, which will be the responsibility of the scouts
at Hutchinson Elementary School to train and care for as a troop
project.

   Two children who told police a
12-year-old playmate had been fatally shot by an assailant in a
passing automobile Tuesday afternoon apparently made up the story,
police said.
   Instead, police believe the three boys were playing with a
loaded gun, Sgt. R. Allen said Tuesday night.
   ``Apparently one of the kids was playing with a gun and they
fabricated the story,'' he said.
   The victim was identified as Paul Davis. He was shot while
standing in a yard with two friends, police said.
   ``He was struck in the back and died a short time later at the
hospital,'' Cmdr. Terry Ebert said.
   The other two boys, who were unhurt, at first told police that
Paul was killed by a single shot fired from a car.
   Such assaults have become relatively commonplace among the
gang-infested neighborhoods of south-central Los Angeles and nearby
communities.
   Allen said late Tuesday that homicide investigators still were
talking with the families involved, and a decision had not been
reached on whether any charges will be filed.

<HEAD>Jazz Musician Suffered Nerve Damage, Expects To Resume Career</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist Larry
Carlton says he's in a lot of pain and suffered nerve damage as a
result of a gunshot wound to the neck, but expects his career to be
``grooving'' by this time next year.
   Carlton, 40, said in a recent interview he has a clear memory of
the April 6 shooting by two young assailants in the doorway of his
office at his Hollywood Hills home.
   Carlton spoke in a whisper during the interview, the result of
permanent nerve damage to his left vocal cord suffered in the
attack.
   He said he is depressed, but looks forward to resuming the
career that has made him one of the industry's busiest studio
musicians. His doctor said it was impossible to say how long it
would take to recover.
   ``The fact is that I'm just a really thankful guy right now,''
Carlton said. ``I'm recovering fine, in a lot of pain, true, but
this time next year I ought to be grooving, thank God.''
   Surgery has repaired damage to his carotid artery, but the
trauma suffered by the nerves in his left side will be slow in
healing, said his physician, Dr. Eric Schlesinger.
   Schlesinger said Carlton ``was extraordinarily lucky.
Considering where the bullet was, the velocity and the high
caliber, the fact that he's alive is astounding.''
   No suspects have been identified, and police still don't have a
clear motive for the attack other than robbery or an interrupted
burglary.
   A $20,000 reward has been offered for information leading to an
arrest.
   Carlton won a Grammy this year for best pop instrumental for his
version of the Doobie Brothers' ``Minute By Minute.'' In 1981, he
shared a Grammy with pianist Mike Post for the theme to ``Hill
Street Blues.''

<HEAD>New Jersey Trying To Edge Its Way Into The Spotlight With
California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the final push of the primary season, it's
California that seems to get all the attention. But New Jersey is
also looking for a little respect.
   The two states hold primaries on the same day _ June 7 _ along
with Montana and New Mexico.
   California, with its prize of 314 delegates and its importance
in the general election, naturally finds its way into the campaign
spotlight.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson, for one, is throwing nearly all of his
remaining resources, both time and money, into his California
campaign.
   Vice President George Bush, the GOP nominee-to-be, is
campaigning as intensely as if he still had active primary
opponents and needed California's 175 Republican delegates. Bush is
clearly looking to the fall campaign, in which California's 47
electoral votes could be pivotal.
   But New Jersey wants a share of the limelight too.
   Though offering only about a third of the delegates at stake in
Calfornia, New Jersey is still the nation's eighth-largest primary,
with 109 Democratic delegates and 64 Republican delegates at stake.
   The candidates can't really afford to turn their their backs on
those kind of numbers, despite the headaches of simultaneously
running campaigns on both sides of the country.
   Even if jet lag is the price to be paid, they're taking the New
Jersey primary seriously.
   Both Jackson and Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis were in
New Jersey on Sunday, and Jackson will be back next week.
   Dukakis was scheduled to campaign in New Jersey on Wednesday and
Thursday before heading to Los Angeles.
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, chairman of the Jackson campaign in
New Jersey, says even if the candidate can't be in two places at
once, he'll make his presence felt in New Jersey.
   ``He's everywhere you have to go to get votes,'' said James.
   Observers are already predicting Jackson will do well in New
Jersey's cities and among minority voters, but Dukakis seen as
likely to win the state by a sizable margin.
   Rep. James Florio of New Jersey, a Dukakis backer, says even
though the Massachusetts governor is favored in the state, he
doesn't intend to get complacent and slight New Jersey.
   ``The combination of New Jersey and California are very
important,'' Florio said. Aides to Dukakis are hoping the
combination of contests on June 7 will give their candidate the
number of delegates he needs to clinch the Democratic nomination.
   In past elections, New Jersey has demonstrated some clout.
   In 1984, Walter Mondale racked up a comfortable win over Gary
Hart and Jackson in New Jersey, a victory that did much to nail
down the nomination. The same day, Hart scored a 2-1 triumph over
Mondale in California, but it was too little, too late.
   Still, some New Jersey politicians long for a place in the sun _
without having to compete with California.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, a Republican, has attempted
unsucessfully to have the date of the state's primary moved up.
   ``I worry that New Jersey is getting lost in the presidential
primary shuffle,'' Kean said in a speech to the state Legislature.
   A bipartisan commission suggested holding the primary a week
earlier this year, but the proposal was not acted upon.
   ``They were only attempting to get it out from the shadow of
California,'' said Kean spokesman Carl Golden.

<HEAD>Dukakis Scores Another Primary Win, Looks Ahead To Fall Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, who added Oregon to his growing
list of primary wins is talking more and more like a man who fully
expects to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Dukakis has been at pains in recent weeks to avoid sounding
overconfident, but in his victory statement Tuesday night he was
looking ahead to a fall faceoff with Republican nominee-to-be
George Bush following the final round of primaries.
   ``We will campaign hard for victories in California, New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico on June 7 and for the White House next
fall,'' he said.
   The people of Oregon, he said, ``voted for a candiate who can
win the presidency.''
   A day earlier, at the Statehouse, Dukakis made some lighthearted
remarks that also reflected confidence.
   ``This state will be blessed with a great new governor,'' Dukaks
said Tuesday night at a birthday party for Massachusetts Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy. She would succeed Dukakis if he assumes the
presidency in January.
   Dukakis drew laughs from the friendly crowd by delivering a
standard joke _ that if he moves to the White House, he will have
``an opportunity to live in public housing for the first time in my
life.''
   Dukakis was tending to state business today before leaving
tonight for campaign appearances in New York and in New Jersey,
which holds its primary June 7. Dukakis won the New York primary
last month but, with an eye on the fall, already has returned there
several times for fund-raisers and other events.
   His loss to Jesse Jackson in the District of Columbia primary
was the only Dukakis defeat in the last 10 primaries.
   The governor was to spend Thursday morning in New Jersey before
heading to California for a weekend of campaigning in advance of
that delegate-rich state's primary, also June 7, the final day of
the primary season.
   Before heading to Murphy's birthday party, Dukakis met at the
Statehouse for 90 minutes with Rep. Mel Levine of California, a
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an expert on
U.S.-Israeli relations.
   Dukakis has been holding a series of meetings with congressional
leaders aimed at bolstering his standing in foreign policy matters.
   ``It was a very productive meeting,'' Levine said as he left the
governor's office. ``I found the governor's questions to be to the
point, reflecting a substantive background in the area, a great
deal of sympathy for our concerns and a real inquisitive mind and
interest in finding solutions to very difficult problems'' in the
Middle East.
   Levine also said Dukakis is in ``terrific shape'' to win the
California primary.
   Dukakis aides say they expect the contests in California and New
Jersey to push the governor over the 2,081-delegate mark needed to
secure the nomination.

<TEXT>
   The new mayor says he wants to
shake this town's speed-trap reputation by giving a free ride out
of court to traffic violators, but the former sheriff retorted,
``The man is a stone-cold idiot.''
   ``I envision a police department that is not a cash register on
(Highway) 59,'' Mayor Robert Devaney said Tuesday after his first
council meeting. Devaney, a 66-year-old accountant, took office
Friday.
   Patton Village's new council members agreed to research
Devaney's proposed ``amnesty program'' for those cited as traffic
violators to determine if it would be legal.
   ``It's a parasitical situation. We're mooching off citizens of
East Texas by writing up citations and abusing people, according to
reports I've heard,'' Devaney said. ``It's my intent and desire to
remit all these fines, wipe them out and dismiss them.''
   However, Alan E. Hall, who last week announced his resignation
as police chief, warned that Devaney's action would trigger
liability problems and lawsuits for false arrest.
   ``He's going to shut down court, padlock the doors and open up
this whole town to lawsuits,'' said Hall, who has been told to
vacate his office immediately. ``It don't take an Einstein to
figure it out from a liability standpoint. The man is a stone-cold
idiot.''
   For years, Patton Village has been a notorious speed trap where
police strictly enforced a 55 mph limit. U.S. 59 is a major divided
highway a few miles east of Interstate 45, the main route between
Dallas and Houston.
   Devaney and three new council members ran on a platform that
supported giving voters the option of disincorporating the town of
1,300 residents.
   The Municipal Court will remain closed and a constable from
Mongtomery County will investigate warrants issued by the police
department to see if they were executed properly, Devaney said
following Tuesday's council meeting, which was attended by an
applauding crowd of about 20 people.
   City secretary Linda Cayton, who resigned in protest Tuesday
after the council meeting, said 90 percent of the town's 1987
fiscal budget of $435,000 came from traffic tickets and other
municipal court fines. From August through March, the court
generated $180,502 in town income, she said.
   The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct recently issued a
warning to the town's municipal court, ordering officers to stop
arresting out-of-county residents without taking them before a
magistrate.
   Floyd Duval, Patton Village's municipal judge, was suspended by
the commission pending the outcome of an official oppression charge
against him. He is accused of offering to pay a woman's traffic
ticket in exchange for sex.
   The 20-member police department remains in operation, but
officials said the officers won't be out on the highway setting up
a speed trap.
   ``The officers may be out there periodically, but they won't be
citing people for going two miles over the speed limit or other
things like that,'' said the new police chief, J.D. Broussard Jr.
   Devaney said the court will be closed for about 30 days and then
reopened ``hopefully with a different focus, not getting money
we're not entitled to.''

<HEAD>European Space Agency Makes 18th Successful Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The European Space Agency has
scored its 18th success in 22 launches of the Ariane rocket,
sending an Intelsat V telecommunications satellite into orbit in a
near-flawless operation.
   The only incident was a 15-minute halt in the countdown caused
by a storm cloud passing by six minutes before scheduled liftoff.
   The launch took place at 8:58 p.m. Tuesday (7:58 p.m. EDT).
Sixteen minutes and 40 seconds later, the 4,374-pound satellite
separated perfectly. Officials at the European space center in
Kourou, on the north coast of South America, called the flight ``a
complete success.''
   It was the second successful operation this year. Six more
launches are planned in 1988 and nine each in 1989 and 1990.
   Three of Ariane's four launch failures were caused by problems
with the rocket's third stage. The last failure, in 1986, halted
the program for nearly a year.
   ``The 22nd Ariane shot is a new success for the European
launcher,'' said President Francois Mitterrand of France in a
message to Frederic Allest, president of Arianespace, the
commercial arm of the space agency.
   ``It is particularly important for the renown of the French and
European space industries at a moment when they are engaged in a
very tight world competition.''
   The Intelsat V-F13 satellite, which was put into a fixed orbit
22,500 miles above Earth, is part of a series of 15 satellites
built by an international consortium led by Ford Aerospace. It
contains 15,000 telephone circuits and two television channels.
   ``The four Ariane shots, after an interruption in launches of
nearly a year, proves the viability of the launcher and puts Europe
in a very good world position, because Arianespace holds 56 percent
of the world orders for satellites,'' said Premier Michel Rocard of
France.
   The Europeans now have 44 launches on their order books
representing $2.6 billion. Ariane launches cost between $53 million
and $105 million, depending on the version.
   The next launch, scheduled for June 8, will be the first of the
new Ariane 4 series, a much larger vehicle capable of carrying 4.2
tons into orbit, nearly double the capacity of Tuesday's Ariane 2.
   Ariane 4, with greater fuel capacity and more powerful motors,
is scheduled to be the commercial workhorse of the European space
effort for the next decade.
   The International Telecommunications Organization plans to send
up one more Intelsat V satellite. Then it too will move into bigger
equipment. The Intelsat VI satellites will contain 40,000 telephone
circuits.
   Commercial satellite launching is also offered by the United
States, the Soviet Union and China.
   The U.S. program still is struggling to get back into
competition, however, because of the major setback suffered when
the space shuttle Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, and other
failures. Seven astronauts died in the disaster.

   David Ruffin, former lead singer of the

cocaine possession charges, his court-appointed lawyer said.
   Detroit Recorder's Court Judge John P. O'Brien issued a bench
warrant for Ruffin's arrest Tuesday morning, several hours after
the singer's nonjury trial was to resume, attorney Jeffrey Collins
said.
   Ruffin, 47, of South Lyon arrived in court in the afternoon,
Collins said. O'Brien had adjourned the case and left instructions
for Ruffin to be held in Wayne County jail if he appeared ``pending
final resolution of the case,'' the attorney said.
   Collins said he planned to ask O'Brien today to reconsider his
order that Ruffin be jailed.
   Police arrested Ruffin on charges of possessing less than 50
grams of cocaine during a raid at a Detroit home last July. Ruffin,
a member of the soul music group from 1963 to 1968, could receive
up to four years in prison if convicted.

<HEAD>Dukakis Critics: Governor Put Off Dealing With Budget Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is under sharp attack from
critics at home, who say he ignored warnings of a state budget
crisis because they came just before key presidential contests.
   Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, has made a string of
balanced state budgets a big selling point in his presidential
campaign. This week, though, he announced that state revenues were
more than $240 million below projections included in the budget.
   ``We're all aboard the government Titanic and instead of women
and children first it's the captain and the crew first,'' House
Taxation Committee Chairman John Flood said Tuesday.
   ``They will be rolling on across the Potomac River while the
ship of Massachusetts goes down with the rest of us on it,'' said
Flood, one of the few Democrats in the Legislature who criticizes
Dukakis publicly.
   Dukakis' top budget aide dismissed the criticism, saying the
governor told lawmakers a year ago the budget was based on revenue
projections that might turn out to be overly optimistic.
   The critics acknowledged getting that warning when Dukakis used
his veto power to slice $88 million from the budget. But they say
the governor should have curbed spending beginning in January, when
the administration conceded revenues for the first half of the
fiscal year were lagging by $200 million.
   But the Dukakis administration said it expected revenues to
improve, and meet targets. That soothing forecast came days before
the Iowa caucuses, the first big test of the campaign year.
   ``If anybody tells you any of this stuff is not related to
presidential politics, either they are naive or they think everyone
else is,'' said Flood.
   Republicans among the Dukakis critics vowed to continue their
attacks and predicted Vice President George Bush would pick up
their themes during his expected fall campaign against Dukakis.
   ``They had to see the problem but they chose to ignore it and
delay acting because it was not favorable to the governor's
campaign,'' said House Minority Leader Steven Pierce. ``As he
campaigned across the country it was his `Massachusetts Miracle'
but now it's our deficit.''
   ``They have known that the budget situation was worsening
daily,'' said Republican Rep. John C. Bradford. He accused Dukakis
of sidestepping his gubernatorial duties while ``fantasizing about
moving to that white building halfway down the Atlantic coast.''
   The figures released Monday showed the state was $243 million
short for the fiscal year that ends June 30, forcing Dukakis to tap
reserve and other funds to balance the budget.
   That figure is $166 million more than the shortfall projected by
the governor's Revenue Advisory Board on April 12.
   By the campaign calendar, that's a week before the big New York
primary, and two weeks before the Pennsylvania primary. Dukakis won
them both, tightening his grip on the nomination with followup
victories in Indiana and Ohio.
   The $243 million shortfall is in addition to $233 million for
planned budget expenditures that have been canceled because of the
fiscal crunch.
   ``Add that up and this state is $470 million out of balance,''
Flood said. ``They had to know it but they just ignored it for
political reasons.''
   Secretary of Administration and Finance Frank Keefe scoffed at
the criticism, pointing to the vetoes last year and the
legislature's rejection of a $255 million Dukakis-filed tax
enforcement and fee package.
   ``I'm a little bit amused by folks who want to rewrite
history,'' Keefe said Tuesday. ``It was the legislature that fully
believed the future was going to be just like the immediate past,
which was a period of enormous good fortune.''
   Keefe said Dukakis had instructed him as far back as September
1987 to put together contingency plans to cut $185 million in
spending and at several intervals since has told Keefe to look for
further cuts.
   The administration considered the Revenue Advisory Board's April
projected shortfall of $77 million conservative, but did not say so
publicly because that might have hurt the state's credit rating,
Keefe said.
   ``We weren't about to say absolutely that things were horrible
when we had no concrete evidence that was the case,'' said Keefe.

<HEAD>Bush Seems More And More Like An Underdog As He Campaigns In
California</HEAD>

   As George Bush said, ``It hasn't been a good
day.''
   The Republican nominee-to-be did win another uncontested primary
victory Tuesday in Oregon. But he also had to face polls suggesting
his standing is slipping in a hypothetical fall matchup with
Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   A Los Angeles Times poll out today indicated Bush trails Dukakis
in California, a key battleground in November.
   The vice president concedes that his problem might stem in part
from troubles that have dogged the Reagan administration _
controversies about Attorney General Edwin Meese, Panamanian
military leader Manuel Noriega and the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It could an accumulation of current events, but I don't worry
about it. I've learned not to live on these polls,'' Bush said,
talking to police officers battling gangs in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
   Stopping drug traffic is Bush's topic today, as he visits a
house where crack was sold and visits a school fighting its own
drug problem.
   But Bush's woes all but drowned out his talk of agriculture and
drugs on Tuesday.
   ``It's hasn't been too good a day,'' he said in Los Angeles.
``But it will turn around, it will turn around.''
   Part of the problem is the combination of the Democratic and
Republican nomination fights at this point, Bush aides said.
   ``Dukakis is in a very enviable position _ he is scoring a knock
every Tuesday, while we have no opponents ... and we have suffered
in the polls,'' said spokesman Pete Teeley.
   Teeley admitted the administration's problems are Bush's:
``Whatever happens to the administration rubs off on the vice
president.''
   Bush has refused to talk about Meese's problems, but he stepped
a slight distance away from the Reagan administration on the furor
over a proposed deal with Noriega, admitting a deal is unpopular.
   Asked about a Senate resolution condemning any deal, he said:
``I think it expresses a lot of the strong feeling out there across
the country on that matter, very strong.''
   But despite repeated questions, Bush refused to give his opinion
on whether Noriega should be allowed to escape drug-running charges
in exchange for stepping down.
   Bush took the offensive on the Iran-Contra affair, accusing
Democrats of leaking ``scurrilous allegations'' against him that
aren't true.
   ``You've had endless investigations _ each one with a lot of
Democrats slavering, trying to find something wrong and they
haven't,'' Bush told reporters in Fresno. ``The American people are
fair. They know when someone is telling the truth.''
   The vice president professed not to be concerned about a CBS
News-New York Times poll putting him 10 points behind Dukakis. The
poll put Bush at 39 percent and Dukakis at 49 percent in a fall
matchup.
   In another poll, limited to California, Dukakis' lead was even
wider. A Los Angeles Times survey suggested Dukakis had a 17-point
lead over Bush in the state _ 53 percent to 36 percent, with 11
percent undecided. The Times poll questioned 2,202 Californians by
telephone in six days, ending Monday night. The margin of error was
3 percentage points.
   Bush acknowledged those kind of numbers were not good news.
   ``No, they weren't,'' he said. But he quickly pointed to polls
indicating he trailed in New Hampshire, a primary he went on to win.
   Bush argued that the fall campaign has not really begun, so
hypothetical matchups at this point don't prove much.
   ``The thing hasn't really started in terms of Democrats versus
Republicans and we haven't gotten any of that in focus and it won't
be until after the convention,'' Bush said, adding he will ``not
try to join every issue with the Democrats or start jumping all
over them right now.''
   Bush's negative ratings were high in the CBS-Times poll.
Thirty-three percent said they had a favorable view of Bush, but
even more _ 35 percent _ said they had an unfavorable view. While
voters are less familiar with Dukakis, his favorable rating stood
at 38 percent and unfavorable at 14 percent.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said that the negative ratings
can change quickly in a presidential campaign.
   ``Positive and negatives can turn around overnight,'' Atwater
said.

   Three men who smuggled a bomb from Canada
into Vermont belong to a Syrian terrorist group that assassinated
Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, officials said in asking
for maximum sentences.
   U.S. Attorney George Terwilliger III said Tuesday he was aware
of the association within 48 hours of the Oct. 23, 1987, arrests.
   ``We deliberately kept the association out of our case because
it was not relevant to any of the charges,'' Terwilliger said. ``We
came away from the trial without any possible taint to our case
that premature disclosure of this association might have caused.''
   U.S. District Judge Albert Coffrin has not set a sentencing date
for the three Lebanese-born Canadians.
   ``Acts of terrorism such as suicide bombings, kidnappings and
murder have become all too commonplace as instrumentalities of
political operations in some parts of the world,'' Terwilliger said.
   ``What this case is about is an attempt to import those
techniques into the territory of the United States.''
   That charge drew an immedate rebuke from a lawyer for one of the
men, who said the FBI had failed to produce any proof that three
are members of the Syrian Social National Party.
   ``They're going to have to prove it,'' said Mark Keller, a
lawyer for defendant Walid Kabbani. ``We can say no, he's not a
member of the party. Is that enough?''
   Floyd Clarke, head of the FBI's criminal investigation division,
said sources and channels of information on which the allegation
was based are confidential.
   The three were arrested Oct. 23, 1987, in Richford after the
town police chief spotted them behaving suspiciously near the
international border. A search of their van turned up explosives,
authorities said.
   It is believed to be the first time Middle Eastern terrorists
have been arrested in the United States carrying explosives, said
Justice Department spokesman John Russell.
   ``Based on the information known by the FBI, it is our judgment
that the crimes committed by the defendants in Vermont were
undertaken in furtherance of the defendants' SSNP activities,''
Clarke said in an affidavit.
   Clarke's affidavit said the FBI does not have enough information
to state conclusively the intended bomb target.
   The affidavit was submitted with a sentencing memo and filed by
Terwilliger in U.S. District Court in Burlington.
   Walid Mourad pleaded guilty Jan. 26 to conspiring to transport
explosives and an immigration violation, and faces up to 10 years
in prison.
   George Younan and Kabbani were found guilty by a jury of several
explosives violations and an immigration violation. Younan faces up
to 35 years in prison and Kabbani up to 30 years and six months.
   All three are in custody awaiting sentencing.
   The SSNP is responsible for car bombings in Lebanon in 1985 and
1986 that killed 105 people and injured 378, as well as the 1982
assassination of Gemayel, Clarke's affidavit said.
   The group began in the 1930s as a fascist paramilitary
organization opposing the French Mandate Regime in Lebanon and
espousing ``Greater Syria,'' which envisioned Syrian control of
Lebanon and what was then Palestine, the affidavit said.

<HEAD>Report: Chile Obstructing Efforts To Learn Fate of `Disappeared'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-level Chilean officials are foiling attempts
to learn the fate of nearly 700 prisoners who vanished in the four
years after Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973, Amnesty
International charged today.
   In an 18-page report, the London-based organization said: ``Many
aspects of secret police and military operations have come to light
in the past decade and provide overwhelming evidence that the
`disappeared' were victims of the military government's program to
eliminate suspected opponents.''
   Amnesty appealed to Chilean authorities to account for the
prisoners.
   The report said the prisoners' plight had been sufficiently
documented by non-governmental investigations to be presented to
Chilean courts, but that in virtually all cases the investigations
have been blocked by higher courts or obstructed by the security
forces.
   In some cases, the courts have determined the fate of prisoners
and found that military and police personnel were involved in the
detention, torture and murder of the victims, it said.
   But the report said Chilean authorities often have issued false
or misleading reports on the missing persons, suggesting that the
names were assumed or invented.
   Amnesty International said its report compiles for the first
time a summary of the evidence on the arrests and the secret
detention centers where prisoners were held by what it called
Chile's ``secret military and police apparatus.''
   The evidence has been gathered by relatives, human rights groups
and members of the judiciary, the report said, and includes the
testimony of hundreds of former prisoners who saw the missing men
and women in detention centers and have identified those who
operated the centers.
   Other evidence came from confessions by former security force
officers describing how the ``disappearances'' took place.
   The disappearances of Chilean citizens dropped sharply in 1977
but have not stopped completely, the report said, adding that five
opposition activists disappeared as recently as September.
   Some court cases involving evidence of serious crimes, including
those relating to disappearances, have been closed under a 1978
amnesty law preventing prosecution for certain crimes committed in
the five years after Pinochet came to power in a military coup, the
report said.
   In June 1987, the Appeals Court in Santiago upheld a lower court
decision that the amnesty law applied to the case of 10 members of
the outlawed Communist Party whose 1976 disappearance was being
investigated by Judge Carlos Cerda.
   Cerda caused a sensation in 1986 by charging 38 members of the
military, including high-ranking officers in active service, in the
illegal arrest of two political prisoners who subsequently
disappeared.
   Amnesty International has said the ruling could effectively
block future judicial investigations into missing prisoners.

   Kelly Reno, the young star of the rustic
``Black Stallion'' movies, says he's at home on the range and won't
regret it if he never does another movie.
   ``If I really wanted to be an actor, I wouldn't have gotten
married,'' said Reno, a 21-year-old 6-footer who operates a ranch
for a living in Pueblo County. ``I would have gone to Hollywood and
taken any role available.''
   Reno is best known for his starring roles in the 1979 ``The
Black Stallion'' and 1983's ``The Black Stallion Returns.'' He also
appeared in the movie ``Blade's Escape,'' and starred in a 1985
episode of Steven Spielberg's ``Amazing Stories.''
   Reno said recently he would like to do classic westerns, but he
quickly added, ``If I never do another one (movie) again, I'll
never regret it.''
   He and his wife, Lynette, were married in August 1986. They own
40 acres, lease another 4,000 acres of grazing land and run 200
head of cattle on their spread south of Pueblo.

<TEXT>
   Several radio stations broadcast
reports critical of Sandinista policies in defiance of the leftist
government which threatened to impose sanctions unless the stations
tone down their criticism.
   One of the stations, Radio Corporacion, on Tuesday quoted the
head of the non-governmental human rights commission, Lino
Hernandez, as saying the communications law which the government
had threatened to apply is ``absolutely a violation of human
rights.''
   Interior Ministry officials summoned directors of eight private
radio news programs to a meeting on Saturday and told them to be
careful about reporting on military recruitment, the economy and
government.
   On Tuesday, Radio Noticias reported the black market rate for
dollars was rising, criticized several government measures for
causing unemployment and called the state-run oil company an
``organism without authority.''
   The Roman Catholic Church station, Radio Catolica, condemned the
media restrictions, which critics called a backward step in the
process of democratic reform.
   Radio Mundial said in an editorial: ``The liberals, having
suspended the state of emergency, substituted it with another
system based on the application of the law of security and
maintenance of public order.''
   The vaguely worded communications law, which the Sandinistas had
been applying since they seize power in 1979, provides for
sanctions that include closing the stations.
   Under another law, which the Sandinistas enacted in 1982 and
rescinded in January, censorship of newspapers and radio was
allowed.
   The Sandinista government began to loosen press restrictions in
the fall as part of its compliance with a Central American peace
plan signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa, which had been closed for 15
months and permitted to reopen in October, criticized the
government threat in an editorial on Monday. ``The Sandinista
regime,'' it said, ``imposes censorship restrictions on the
broadcasters because it doesn't want freedom of expression.'' The
editorial's headline was: ``The Muzzle Law Returns.''
   La Prensa said some of its reporters have been harassed by the
Sandinistas, but that the government has not interfered with its
editorial policy.

   A city bus crashed into a utility pole near
downtown Tuesday night, killing a 14-year-old boy and injuring
about 20 other people, authorities said.
   Witnesses indicated that a car may have caused the accident and
sped away, said Sgt. Lou Narducci of the Greater Cleveland Regional
Transit Authority police.
   Narducci said about 16 people were on board the bus when it hit
the pole and a chain-link fence, but Cleveland police officer Emil
Cielec said 20 people were taken to four hospitals.
   ``We've heard a lot of different versions of what happened, and
it's up to the city police to figure it out,'' Narducci said. ``We
know that the bus hit a utility pole and the fence and that another
car was involved.''
   Anthony Hardaway, a resident in a nearby YMCA building, said he
was in his room when there was a ``boom and a flash that made me
jump.''
   He said he ran outside and saw that a bus was involved in the
accident.
   ``There was nobody around, and me and some other guys tried to
help,'' he said. ``I went in the bus, but I don't want to talk
about what I saw because it was bad. I knew one boy had it.''
   The front of the bus was demolished. Another car nearby also was
damaged on the front end, and part of the utility pole was on the
car. Police were questioning the driver of that car.
   The boy, who was not immediately identified, was dead on arrival
at St. Vincent Charity Hospital and Health Center, said Dr. Carla
Streep O'Day, director of emergency services. She said it appeared
that a post from a metal fence pierced him in his side.
   The bus driver, Audrey Simmons, was admitted in fair condition
with a broken leg, hospital spokeswoman Maria Tayek said.

<HEAD>New Studies Support Radical Theory About Origin Of Earth's Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Support is growing among scientists for a
controversial theory that all the Earth's water _ including oceans,
lakes and icecaps _ originated from blackened snowball comets that
even now are falling from space by the millions.
   Papers presented Tuesday at the American Geophysical Union
meeting here, along with studies reported from Europe and Canada,
are slowly adding scientific weight to a concept that once
threatened to undermine the career of University of Iowa physicist
Louis A. Frank.
   The findings, Frank said Tuesday, are beginning to ease the
professional pain he first endured after publishing the theory two
years ago.
   ``No one has yet found data to show the comets don't exist,'' he
said. The support helps, but Frank admitted, ``My life would
certainly have been easier'' if his snowballs-from-space theory had
never been published.
   The Iowa scientist based his theory on data gathered from 1981
to 1986 by the Dynamics Explorer I satellite. In pictures taken to
study air glow around the Earth, Frank found unexplained holes that
appeared to have been punched through the upper atmosphere.
   He puzzled over the problem for months and discarded dozens of
possible answers before concluding that the only thing that could
make the holes were 100-ton comets made of ice and covered with a
black hydrocarbon. And he calculated they were falling to Earth at
the rate of 10 million a year.
   The comets, which are actually ice balls, would come apart as
they neared the Earth and would then flash to vapor in the
atmosphere, Frank said. Eventually, the vapor fell as rain and
joined the Earth's water cycle.
   He calculated that the snowballs, measuring about 30 feet across
each, contributed the equivalent of one inch of water all over the
Earth's surface every 10,000 years.
   ``That may not sound like much,'' Frank said, but if this
started 4.5 billion years ago when the Earth was formed, the black
snowballs would put enough water on the planet to fill the oceans
and build the polar ice packs.
   And if the snowball comets continue for billions of more years,
as Frank believes, it could make major changes to the Earth's
climate.
   Initially, many scientists met the idea with ridicule and Frank
said he feared for his career. But some took it seriously enough to
test the concept with experiments.
   Clayne Yeates, a physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
California, said Tuesday he at first was very skeptical.
   But Yeates said he used a powerful space search telescope at the
Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona to scan the heavens for the
snowballs, and did, in fact, capture photo views of the speeding
comets approaching Earth.
   ``It was remarkable. The results agreed exactly with the
predictions,'' said Yeates.
   Thomas Donahue, a space physicist at the University of Michigan,
thought Frank's theory could be disproved by measuring the level of
hydrogen atoms, which would be released by the water vapor, in the
space about the Earth.
   He studied ultraviolet data collected by the Voyager 2
spacecraft, expecting to find that the hydrogen atoms would be at a
low level. Instead, the data showed the hydrogen was much denser
than expected, enough to support Frank's theory.
   A group of Canadian scientists studying data from a camera
carried aboard a spacecraft called Viking (pronounced ``Vicking'')
discovered that it, too, detected the ``atmospheric holes'' that
Frank found in the Explorer satellite data.
   Other studies also are lending support to the theory. These
include:
   _A Penn State University study has used microwave detectors to
confirm the presence of water volumes at high altitudes. Similar
data were reported by West German scientists using rockets to study
the atmosphere 60 to 80 miles above the Earth.
   _A study of one of history's most famous space snowball,
Halley's Comet, has shown that the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in
the comet is the same as in the oceans of Earth, indicating that
comets could have contributed this ratio to the planet.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of disabled White House Press
Secretary James Brady is pressuring a key House opponent of
deadlocked handgun control legislation by making an emotional
appeal to his campaign contributors.
   Sarah Brady said in a telephone interview Tuesday that her
efforts on behalf of the bill include a pitch to campaign
contributors of Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
   ``We are trying everything, everything reasonable we can think
of'' to get the measure approved by the House Judiciary crime
subcommittee, said Sarah Brady, whose husband was shot by John
Hinckley in the 1981 attempt on President Reagan's life.
   The bill would establish a national seven-day waiting period to
permit local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks
on handgun buyers, if they thought them necessary.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the subcommittee's chairman and a
supporter of the bill, said the measure's prospects weren't good
this year.
   ``I've been working the last month and a half trying to get
votes, and there is no bipartisan consensus,'' Hughes said.
   ``Clay needs to hear from people back home that a vote for the
Brady bill is the right thing to do,'' said a letter from Mrs.
Brady to one of Shaw's contributors in Jacksonville.
   The ``gun lobby is spending millions of dollars'' to defeat the
measure, and Shaw was under ``intense pressure'' to oppose it, she
wrote.
   Shaw said in an interview that he never had been lobbied that
way before. ``I thought that was kind of clever,'' he said.
   Hughes said the bill has the support of five Democrats on the
panel, but is opposed by the four Republicans and Rep. Harley
Staggers, D-W.Va.
   National Rifle Association lobbyist Dave Conover said the NRA
opposes the bill in part because most states have considered the
waiting period question on their own, and many have rejected it.
However, about one-third of the states have adopted their own
waiting periods.
   Mrs. Brady said that if a seven-day waiting period had existed
in 1981, Hinckley would have been unable to buy the handgun used in
the assassination attempt from a Dallas pawn shop because it would
have been discovered that he lied about his address.
   But Shaw said he believed a study was needed to ``see whether
the waiting period is really going to achieve its purpose of
keeping guns out of the hands of felons.'' Among the questions, he
said, are whether information and record-keeping systems are
sufficient to meet the demands of the bill.
   James Brady officially has retained the title of Reagan's press
secretary despite his injury. His wife has also lobbied for a
House-approved bill that would ban plastic guns and any other
firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors and X-ray
machines.

<TEXT>
   Employees at a new Japanese-American
steel plant in this Ohio River town are diligent and hard workers,
says the mill's top executive. But they have one flaw.
   ``There is a very bad habit _ spitting,'' Takamasa Yamamura,
chairman and chief executive officer of Wheeling-Nisshin Inc., said
at dedication ceremonies Tuesday. ``I asked the employees, `Please
stop the spitting. This is my house.'''
   Spitting is ubiquitous in West Virginia, as is chewing tobacco.
But it's not welcome in the spotless, state-of-the-art
steel-coating plant.
   Company officials and politicians hope the plant will ignite an
economic recovery in the upper Ohio River Valley, where idle steel
mills sit rusting.
   ``This project is very important because it is coming at a very
difficult time in the American steel industry,'' said Yuzuru Abe,
chairman and chief executive officer of Japan's Nisshin Steel Co.
Ltd. Nisshin co-owns the plant in a joint venture with
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., which operated a steel plant at
the site before it closed.
   Politicians, workers and townspeople joined company officials in
dedicating the $65 million, computer-controled mill. Even the
refreshments reflected the cross-cultural marriage _ sushi and
chicken were served while a high school band played standards of
the 1940s.
   ``This has to be the happiest day of my life, believe me,'' said
Mayor Adam Dalessio. ``In a short time, we have come from what was
a very gray future to one bright with opportunities.''
   As proof of the town's rebound, the mayor, who worked at the
former Wheeling-Pitt plant for more than 40 years, cited the
opening of a new fast-food restaurant and a bank. A new supermarket
and drug store are scheduled to open within a month in the town of
3,900 people.
   Wheeling-Pitt provided the land along the Ohio River where the
3-block-long plant sits. The plant was built with the help of $55
million in loans from Sanwa Bank of Japan and an $8.75 million
federal urban development grant.
   Follansbee was selected over towns in Pennsylvania and Ohio that
sought the mill, which employs about 90 and will grow to 100
workers when it enters full production in July.
   The aluminized and galvanized steel the plant produces resists
rust and is used in construction, automobiles and appliances.
Coated, flat-rolled steel is considered one of the most profitable
sectors in the highly competitive steel industry.
   Wheeling-Pitt, which supplies about 80 percent of the steel used
by the plant, will receive a third of the profits generated at
Follansbee. Nisshin Steel, Japan's sixth-largest steel-maker, will

   Among the difficulties faced by the American plant employees,
who will work alongside a few Japanese workers, was adapting to the
Japanese style of management. Everyone at the plant, including
company executives, wears a powder-blue shirt and dark blue
trousers while on the job, and employees will have a say in company
operations.
   Wheeling-Nisshin spent $3 million training the workers,
including sending many to Japan.
   ``I'd like to say thanks for our training,'' said plant employee
John Thompson. ``Not only has it been invaluable, nothing like it
has ever happened to me in my lifetime.''

   An FBI report says Soviet intelligence agents
are among the most enthusiastic users of U.S. libraries, where they
rush to read sensitive technological information before it is
classified.
   The report, released Tuesday, said the Soviets are looking for
``scientific and technical documents on a variety of topics'' and
``the most recent developments in America's military programs.''
   But a representative of the 50,000-member American Library
Association says FBI countermeasures have gone too far with ``a
more generalized effort to solicit librarians to do surveillance
work.''
   Patrice McDermott, assistant director of the associations's
office for intellectual freedom, said enlisting the support of
librarians in identifying suspicious individuals violates
professional ethics.
   Soviet agents try to identify ``the nation's emerging technology
before its components become classified or restricted,'' the FBI
said.
   Libraries also are places where Soviets try to recruit those
with technological expertise, especially Americans who might have
access to classified information, according to the report.
   Americans who provide only public information initially may be
asked for classified material if the relationship with a Soviet
agent evolves, the report said.
   ``The KGB and the Library Target 1962-Present,'' was made public
as FBI Director William Sessions testified before senators on the
bureau's Library Awareness Program _ a counterespionage operation
against the 26-year-old Soviet collection effort.
   The library association disputed Sessions' testimony to the
Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he insisted the FBI program is
confined to 21 scientific and technical libraries in the New York
City area.
   Sessions said the FBI contacted librarians elsewhere, but only
when agents were tracking down specific leads.
   Ms. McDermott said her group has received information that the
FBI asked for the generalized information outside of New York.
   Ms. McDermott added: ``We know that the FBI is applying the name
`Library Awareness Program' only to what is going on in New York.
However, they have sent agents into libraries in other parts of the
country asking generalized information.''
   She said librarians have been asked to inform on people who
``look suspicious, or might be hostile to the United States. It's
been very vague. It's part of a more generalized effort to solicit
librarians to do surveillance work.''
   The report said the Soviets have targeted the Library of
Congress, along with scientific and technical sections of public
libraries, specialized departments of university libraries and
large information clearinghouses.
   The report said the Soviets also are trying to identify selected
librarians to work, wittingly or unwittingly, on behalf of the
Soviet intelligence services. Other targets are college students
and professors, scientists, engineers and corporations who work in
areas of advanced technology.
   ``The utilization of the libraries is a fertile area for the
training and developing of newly recruited agents,'' the report
said.
   While the information is unclassified, the Soviets use unlawful
methods to obtain it, including removal of ``thousands of documents
from specialized scientific and technical libraries'' by trained
Soviet agents.
   The Soviets also use their exchange students in the United
States to identify useful libraries; to subscribe to literature and
reports; and to obtain material available to them as students.
   Sessions called the library program an important
counterintelligence program, and commented, ``I think we have a
responsibility to do it. Any librarian can say to an FBI agent, `I
do not choose to give that information.'''
   ``People don't come to a technical library to read Goldilocks
and the Three Bears,'' he added.

   Led by ``Captain Hook,'' a hardened
veteran of the high seas, 1,100 endangered sea turtles raised in
captivity splashed into the Gulf of Mexico in a population-boosting
experiment.
   The Kemp's Ridley turtles hit the water eight to 15 miles off
Port Aransas, Texas, on Tuesday, and marine biologists hope the
reptiles will return to multiply on the beaches of Texas after
being decimated by exploitation and pollution earlier this century.
   ``It's quite a day _ raising the little guys from eggs and
getting to see them shipped off,'' said project spokeswoman Donna
Shaver.
   First in the water was ``Captain Hook,'' a turtle caught by a
fisherman whose 3-inch-long hook and steel cable had been imbedded
in its throat. The cable was later surgically removed.
   ``We try not to get emotionally attached to any of them,'' said
Tim Fontaine, project manager of the sea turtle ``head start''
program. ``But we feel really good about him.''
   A total of 13,500 turtles have been freed by the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Galveston in the last 10 years. But as far as
scientists can tell, none has yet returned to nest on western Gulf
of Mexico beaches _ the only place in the world where the Kemp's
Ridleys are known to nest. The turtles are expected to return eight
to 15 years after hatching.
   Apart from Captain Hook, this latest graduating class of turtles
spent most of their lives in small circular tubs, one turtle to a
container, in climate-controlled greenhouses in Galveston.
   Some dove gracefully and others belly-flopped, but once they
were released in 40 to 70 feet of water in the Gulf, they adapted,
well, like sea turtles to water.
   The Kemp's Ridley turtles, considered the world's most
endangered sea turtles, are know by their species name as
Lepidochelys kempi.
   The turtles were hatched from eggs gathered by project workers.
Fontaine supervised their growth since they were 3 to 5 days old
and about the size of silver dollars weighing less than 8 ounces.
   Today, the year-old turtles weigh about 2{ pounds each. And for
the first time this year, 98 2-year-old turtles weighing about 25
pounds each were released in hopes that more mature animals will
stand a better chance of surviving.
   Galveston-grown turtles _ marked with metal tags or special skin
grafts or electronic and magnetic devices _ have been found as far
away as Morocco, France and Newfoundland. The mystery, however, is
what triggers the animal's nesting and return to the Gulf.
   The program has received a five-year extension, and Fontaine
said it probably would end then if no new nests are discovered.
   In the late 1940s, up to 40,000 turtles nested in a single day
near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, about 200 miles south of Brownsville,
Texas.
   Today, fewer than 600 turtles nest in the entire season from
April through July or August.
   The population decline came as the beaches and turtles and eggs
were exploited from the 1940s until the 1960s. In Mexico, the
turtle was believed to be an aphrodisiac.
   Education programs and guards posted at the nesting beach in
Mexico have resolved those problems.
   Still, the turtles face pollution, debris and fishing trawlers
as enemies.
   Tony Amos, an oceanographer at the University of Texas, said
autopsies on 50 percent of the dead turtles discovered showed
plastic in their stomachs.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Transfer of World Bank Funding Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve senators have suggested that proposed
U.S. funding increases for the World Bank be used instead to make
American industries more competitive.
   In letter released Tuesday to Sen. John Stennis, chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, the senators said they are deeply
concerned about the Reagan administration's request to increase
U.S. funding to the World Bank by $70.1 million annually for the
next six years.
   ``The World Bank continues to subsidize the building of unneeded
foreign production facilities while U.S. plants close and workers
lose their jobs,'' the senators said in their letter.
   The group cited a recent decision by the World Bank to approve a
$400 million loan to Mexico to modernize its steel making
facilities.
   ``Until the World Bank reverses its policy of funding foreign
economic development at the expense of the American worker and
vital U.S. industries, we believe that the taxpayers' money can be
better spent on programs to develop efficient technologies which
make American industries more competitive and put Americans back to
work,'' they said.
   The group suggested the additional $70.1 million proposed for
fiscal 1989 instead be directed to programs that will assist
struggling U.S. industries regain their competitive edge in
international trade.
   The letter was signed by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Howell
Heflin, D-Ala.; Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio;
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; Richard Shelby,
D-Ala.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; and Steven Symms, R-Idaho.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Payroll Tax To Fund Federal Insurance For Long-Term
Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study calls for a new federal
insurance program financed by additional payroll taxes to pay
nursing home bills and other costs of long-term care for the
elderly.
   The report issued Tuesday by the Brookings Institution also says
there should be an expansion of private insurance to help cover
such costs.
   Alice M. Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office
and a lead author of the report, stopped short of saying its
primary recommendation is for a new government program.
   She said the main purpose of the 318-page report was to compile
extensive data for Congress to debate in shaping a national policy.
   However, Ms. Rivlin acknowledged the report envisions the
private insurance as supplementing a government program. For
example, the private insurance would cover co-payments required of
beneficiaries under a Medicare-like plan, or the government role
would be limited to kicking in only after privately financed
benefits are exhausted.
   Long-term care is shaping up as a major issue in 1989, much the
same way catastrophic coverage for acute illness was an overriding
Medicare issue this year. The central question of that 1989 debate
will be over the extent to which payment of long-term care expenses
_ at nursing homes and at home _ should be a federal responsibility.
   No matter what program evolves, Ms. Rivlin said provisions would
have to remain to care for the poor elderly who do not have the
resources to pay for any of their own care.
   The Brookings report says the cost of a new social insurance
program would range between $33 billion and $42 billion, compared
with the $20 billion spent on long-term care under current policies.
   That money could be raised, it said, by a payroll tax of from
2.2 percent to 2.9 percent _ half on employers and half on
employees _ with no cap on the level of wages subject to
withholding.
   Medicare currently is financed by a similar tax, but with a cap
on the income subject to taxation.
   Pending legislation by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., would remove
the cap to provide open-ended home health care for any disabled
person _ young or old.
   Under questioning, Ms. Rivlin said that is a laudable goal,
``but it's also a very tricky problem.''
   ``We're concerned that the Pepper bill does not have adequate
safeguards against escalating costs,'' she said.

<HEAD>Stock Tied to South Africa Sold By Dukakis Family Trust Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial disclosure forms indicate a $1 million
trust fund in which Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis is co-beneficiary sold stock worth up to $65,000 last year
from companies with ties to South Africa.
   The forms, filed with the Federal Election Commission, are
consistent with but more detailed than state financial disclosure
forms filed by the Massachusetts governor last month.
   Dukakis gained no income in 1987 from the family trust
established by his late father, whose equal beneficiaries are
Dukakis and Bates College, the elder Dukakis' alma mater.
   The trust drew attention last year when similar forms filed with
the FEC disclosed that until 1986 it included stock in companies
that do business in South Africa.
   Dukakis has no role in investment decisions of the trust but in
1986, when questioned about its holdings during a gubernatorial
re-election campaign, told the bank which controls the account to
divest any stock in companies with South African dealings. Stock in
10 such companies was immediately sold.
   The trust gained between $15,001 and $50,000 last year by
selling stock in Unisys Corp., which maintains operations in South
Africa. Dukakis campaign spokesman Steven Akey said the trust had
owned stock in a company acquired by Unisys last year and sold it
because of Unisys' ties to South Africa.
   The trust also reported capital gains of between $5,001 and
$15,000 from the sale of Pepsico Inc. stock. The company maintains
indirect ties to South Africa through its Kentucky Fried Chicken
subsidiary.
   Three companies in which the trust has holdings have indirect
ties to racially segregated South Africa, largely through
distribution agreements and spare parts sales contracts, according
to the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center.
They are IBM Corp., General Electric Corp. and American Telephone &
Telegraph.
   Akey said the trust's investment policy is to not acquire stock
in any company on the Washington group's list of companies with
direct dealings in South Africa.
   Dukakis is also a potential co-beneficiary of another $1 million
trust left by his father. But that trust is not considered part of
his net worth because Dukakis' 84-year-old mother controls it and
could decide to alter arrangements which currently call for that
fund to be split by Dukakis and Bates.
   The FEC forms, which cover the period from Jan. 1, 1987, to
March 31, 1988, show Dukakis' principal source of income during
that period was $106,310 from his salary as governor. The forms
were filed Friday.
   He and his wife, Kitty, also earned between $1,001 and $2,500 in
interest from a savings account that holds between $15,001 and
$50,000; between $101 and $1,000 in interest from a smaller bank
account in Mrs. Dukakis' name; and between $5,000 and $15,000 in
interest from the governor's holdings in the state retirement plan.
   Mrs. Dukakis also earned $20,000 last year in salary from a
Harvard University program that cleans up and preserves public
grounds. An investment account in the name of the couple's three
children earned between $2,600 and $5,100 last year, according to
the FEC forms.
   The couple also owns a home in suburban Brookline that is worth
more than $100,000.
   Dukakis and his wife, who do not use credit cards, listed no
liabilities.
   The largest investment in the Panos Dukakis trust is a
tax-exempt money market fund worth between $100,001 and $250,000.
Five of the trust's investments are worth between $50,001 and
$100,000: holdings in Maine municipal bonds, a tax-exempt bank
trust fund, General Electric, AT&T and Atlantic Richfield Corp.

   Q. If I could clear up that one point, though, sir, haven't you
authorized the dropping of the indictment in return for something
on Mr. Noriega's part?
   A. As I have to say, when you're negotiating _ and I did that
for 25 years as a union officer in labor-management relations _ you
don't go out and talk about what you're negotiating.
   Q. Mr. President, now that the conservatives, personified by The
Washington Times, have jumped ship on Attorney General Edwin Meese,
and the loss of morale in the department, the loss of respect for
the Justice Department in the country, and its integrity, are you
still backing Meese and have total confidence in him? Or are you
going to ease him out?
   A. No, I have complete confidence in him. And I know _
   Q. Why?
   A. Because there have been a great many allegations made, but
nothing has been proven and I have seen no evidence of any
wrongdoing on his part of the kind that it is inferred in the
allegations that are being kicked around, and right now on this
particular thing, I think you would have to talk to him about that.
   I think there's more than meets the eye with regard to this
latest departure.
   Q. What do you mean? What are you referring to? You mean that
Eastland did something to undermine the attorney general?
   A. No, he made a statement himself that there was no animosity
in anything that had happened, but I think that you should talk to
the attorney general about that and what happened.
   Q. Well, is that the role of the press officer to be a defense
attorney?
   A. Well, once again, somebody speculated that that's what was
the reason there and I think that you should talk to the attorney
general.
   Q. Mr. President, if you can't discuss the negotations with
Noriega, I would like to ask you, however, about your policy goal.
You have said in the past the goal was to see that Noriega stepped
down from power and at various times, you have talked about leaving
the country, at various times you haven't. Is your goal not only to
see that not only Noriega leaves power, but that none of his
cronies continue to exercise power in his name?

   The names of the dead were known less than
a day after a fiery bus crash killed 27 people, but official
confirmation of the deaths ``just brought it fresh again'' to the
victims' families, a minister says.
   Hearses began removing the bodies Tuesday afternoon from a
National Guard armory in Carrollton, 100 miles northeast of here,
that served as a morgue.
   There was ``a lot of grief'' inside Radcliff First Assembly of
God church, where most of the victims' families gathered Tuesday
morning to be told that the last of the burned bodies had been
identified, said the Rev. Dan Mattingly, minister of Christian
education at the church, which owned the bus.
   ``Some began to break out in tears and grief,'' Mattingly said.
``They pretty well knew it, but to actually hear it once and for
all, one time, 100 percent sure on the confirmations, it just hit
again. It just brought it fresh again in their hearts.''
   The city of Radcliff scheduled a memorial service for Thursday
evening at a high school football field.
   Meanwhile, offers of money and donations of time have poured in
for survivors and their families, hospital officials said.
   Scores of people have called Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville, 30 miles northeast of Radcliff, offering food,
babysitting, and even rooms in their homes to families of
hospitalized victims, said spokeswoman Taylor Rice.
   Callers wishing to donate cash are being referred to one of four
funds set up to aid the victims and their families, she said.
   One survivor, 14-year-old David Walliser, offered thanks from
his bed at Kosair Children's Hospital.
   ``Thanks to all the doctors, thanks to all the nurses, thanks to
everyone who cares. Thanks for all the love and thanks for all the
prayers,'' he said through his mother.
   The bus collided head-on Saturday night with a pickup truck
being driven north in the southbound lanes of Interstate 71 near
Carrollton. The fuel tank on the bus ruptured and burst into
flames, authorities said.
   The bus was returning from a day at an amusement park north of
Cincinnati. Autopsies showed the 27 died of smoke inhalation.
   Fourteen of the bus riders remained hospitalized today with
burns, including eight in critical condition.
   Local, state and federal authorities were continuing the
investigation, but few details of their work were released. State
Police Capt. Neal Brittain said investigators believed they knew
how the pickup truck driver, Larry W. Mahoney, came to be driving
on the wrong side of I-71, but would not elaborate.
   Mahoney, 34, of Worthville was charged Monday with 27 counts of
murder. Tests showed his blood contained nearly 2{ times the amount
of alcohol needed to be declared intoxicated, authorities said. He
was in fair condition at the prison unit of Humana
Hospital-University of Louisville, Ms. Rice said.
   The first victim to be taken from the armory Tuesday was April
Mills, 14, daughter of an Army sergeant, who was to be buried in
Fernandina Beach, Fla. Another victim was to be buried in Tyler,
Texas. The process continued throughout the afternoon.
   At least eight were to be buried in this town of 14,000 people.
Tiny yellow flags marked their plots in North Hardin Memorial
Gardens cemetery near the church.
   The cemetery adjoins North Hardin High School, which three of
the victims attended, and was less than 2 miles from Radcliff
Middle School, which lost 16 pupils in the crash.

   A. I said I wouldn't comment, but I'll make one comment.
   What we're interested in seeing is a restoration of democracy in
Panama.
   It didn't start with this particular name, but sometime back,
under another one, the commanding officer of the National Guard in
Panama suddenly began to take precedence over the president of
Panama and dictate to the government.
   We feel that it's time that democracy return to Panama and this
is what we're negotiating toward.
   Q. Well, sir, if someone controls the government, if Noriega
pulls strings behind the scenes, is that acceptable to you?
   A. Not if we have reinstituted democracy there in Panama, but
again, I can't comment further on this.
   We're in the midst of real negotiations.
   Q. Sir, the fear is that you are going to agree to a deal which
has a figleaf of some restoration of democracy, but in fact leaves
Noriega in power.
   A. Oh, I know. I've been reading that _ the part _ and hearing
it in the newscasts and _
   Q. Well, when you won't comment, sir _
   A. _ no, I'm not going to back away from what we're trying to do.
   Q. Mr. President, there have been charges also that this
government was aware of drug-running involved with the Contra
supply _ possibly illegal Contra supply operation _ can you tell us
_ and the congressional committees have been investigating, that
there was no involvement by this government, the CIA or any other
agencies of this government, in running drugs on the same airplanes
that were bringing weapons to the Contras? And are you
investigating, if you didn't know about it, to see whether there
are any _ is any truth _
   A. All that I knew about any of this, until the indictment came
down, with evidently evidence enough to get to an indictment, that
previously there had been some rumors he was providing information
on the situation in Central America, I think to our intelligence
people and the CIA, some rumors came up about possible drug _ but
no one ever received or could get any evidence to substantiate
those rumors.
   And then this latest thing happened, and I don't know whether
that was whether he just had started, or whether there was anything
really going on.
   Q. But sir, there are other charges that there was other
involvement by this government in drugs on the same airplanes that
were delivering weapons to the Contras, beyond Noriega. Did you
know anything about that? Is there any _
   A. No _
   Q. _ truth to that?

Noriega had to leave the country, ... the Dominican Republic wasn't
far enough, and our recognition of Mr. Delvalle as the president,
how can you do anything in the way of a compromise without
appearing to back down from your original policy goal?

whitewash anyone.

   A. Yeah, I've got _
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. I suggested two more _ three, and then _
   Q. Mr. President, you have repeatedly denied that astrology
played any role in the setting of policy, but you have ducked the
question as to whether or not it played a role in the setting of
schedule. A number of aides besides Mr. Regan have indicated that
astrology did play a role in the setting of schedule, including the
timing of the signing of the INF treaty. Why did you allow that to
go on, sir?
   A. It didn't go on.
   And this whole thing is built around an incident in which it was
printed that this had to do with the scheduling of one of my
operations.
   Well, it didn't happen that way at all.

   And you know something else?
   It didn't have anything to do with me being sworn in as
governor, taking the oath of office at midnight _ or one minute
after midnight back when I first became _ was elected governor.
   What I was doing that time was because once I became
governor-elect, the incumbent governor, whom I had defeated,
started filling up the ranks of appointments and judges to the
place where I would have had a government all set up before I got
in.
   Well, I couldn't do much about it.
   He was still in office until I was signed in.
   I asked the people who'd been in charge of my campaign, Bill
Roberts, when was the earliest that I could become governor.
   And he said, ``Well, the minute after midnight the night before
the inaugural ceremonies.''
   And I said, ``I'm going to get sworn in the minute after
midnight.''
   And I got sworn in, and at least I headed off a half a day's
appointments that he wouldn't have time because the next afternoon,
I was inaugurated.
   Q. We're talking about a couple of specific incidents. Are you
denying that either you or Mrs. Reagan, though, used astrology on
any occasion during your time here at the White House to help to
set the schedule for trips, the signing of the INF treaty? I must
say this goes against what a lot of aides are telling us, sir.
   A. Well, I'm only going to tell that _ one thing.
   And that is, after I had been shot, which was quite a traumatic
experience for my wife _

I was going to do that day and so forth because of _ he mentioned
someone that all the signs were bad and everything else.
   And Nancy was _ it was a trauma that didn't go away easily.
   And when suddenly things of the same kind _ just for a short
period there _ when I was booked for something of the same kind
where the accident occurred _ why, she would ask what does it look
like now?

   Q. (Many voices) ... signing of an INF treaty, sir?
   A. No, it wasn't.
   Nothing of that kind was going on.
   This was all, once again, smoke and mirrors.
   And we made no decisions on it, and we're not binding our lives
to this.
   And I don't mean to offend anyone who does believe in it, or
engages in it _
   Q. Do you believe in it?
   A. I've not tied my life by it, but I won't answer the question
the other way because I don't know enough about it to say is there
something to it or not.
   Q. Do you think the attempt on your life could have been
prevented?
   A. No, this friend thought that had I been told of all _ that
that was supposed to be a horrendous time for me, that I might have
done something. Well, we didn't.
   Q. Mr. President, you often spoke of your belief in the
integrity and honesty of your attorney general. I'd like to ask you
another question, which is: Don't you think that all of these
resignations, and the difficulty of filling the job, and the
attacks from so many directions are, even if he is a man of
integrity and ability _ don't you think this is getting in the way
of the Justice Department doing its job? And isn't that a reason
for him to step aside on those grounds?
   A. No, because I think that there's been a wave, and for quite a
long time _ and not just with him, but with others _ in which
accusation or allegation is taken to mean conviction.
   And there's been too much of that.
   In this land of ours, you are innocent until you are proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
   And nothing has been proven.
   These allegations are _ continue to be made.
   This has been true of others.
   This was true of Ray Donovan, and he's _ his poignant line, I
think, fit the situation.
   When he was declared totally innocent of any wrongdoing at all,
he said, ``Where do I go to get back my reputation?''
   This also applies to Beggs, who finally stood up and resigned
from NASA.
   And because of things he was supposed to have done before he
came into government, and was found innocent of every _ there
wasn't _
   Q. Well, are you saying _
   A. _ an iota of any kind of support for any of the accusations.

<HEAD>Bush Got More than $120,000 in Income from Trust, Petroleum
Partnership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush received more than
$100,000 in income from a qualified trust and $20,773 in a
distributions from a limited petroleum partnership in 1987,
according to papers filed with the government.
   The vice president's office on Tuesday distributed copies of
Bush's 1987 financial disclosure report, filed with the Office of
Government Ethics in accordance with law.
   In addition to the income from the trust, it shows the amount of
Bush's ``distributive share'' from Hollywood L.P.G. No. 2 Limited
Partnership, or his share in the partnership.
   Stephen Hart, the vice president's press secretary, said the
partnership could not be put into the blind trust with Bush's other
assets because the trust covers only shares or other items listed
for trading.
   Other income included a book royalty of $1,575 from Doubleday,
publisher of the vice president's recent book of memoirs.
   Bush had loans of $10,000 to $15,000 from Connecticut General
Life Insurance Co. and $50,000 to $100,000 each from Massachusetts
Mutual and Guardian Life Insurance, all taken out in 1979 at 5 per
cent interest.
   The report showed assets valued at from $73,000 to $160,000 in
bank accounts, credit union and similar investments. It did not
include the home the vice president owns in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Items are required in most cases to be valued only by a range,
rather than the specific figure, in the reports.
   The vice president listed receipt of gifts ranging from a number
of items valued at $100 each to a television set valued at $1,999,
which he received from Dr. and Mrs. Charles Neblett of Houston.
   Hart said the Nebletts are very close friends of the vice
president and his wife.
   Neblett's office in Houston said the doctor was in Tokyo.

   Q. Are you saying then, sir, that unless Mr. Meese would be
indicted, that he should remain in office? Or can there be lesser
allegations that don't require an indictment that would be grounds
for him stepping aside?
   A. I think that for him to step aside would be what he, himself,

this cloud, but with nothing that had ever been proven.
   Q. Well, what about the McKay report?

   Q. Thank you, sir. One more about Noriega. The combination of
sanctions and _ the combination of sanctions and negotiations has
been going on for an awfully long time, and it seems as if the
United States looks progressively weaker. Aren't you a little angry
that Noriega has managed to humiliate and embarrass the United
States?
   A. Well, we had hoped that we could make it possible for the
people of Panama themselves to exert some pressure and do
something. And I guess, having run into their own armed troops
willing to shoot, and shooting, kind of cooled that down.
   So we are continuing to negotiate, and our goal remains the same.
   Q. But sir, are you not angry about the fact that the United
States has been looking so weak when it's gone up against this man?
   A. Well, whether I'm angry or not doesn't count.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has disclosed he and his wife
have stock and bank account holdings worth at least $345,000 and
possibly more than $510,000.
   The figures were contained in a personal financial statement
presidential candidates are required to file with the Federal
Election Commission. But since the forms require only that a range
of value be stated, the exact amount of the assets cannot be pinned
down.
   Jackson listed stocks and bank accounts collectively worth
between $95,000 and $260,000, plus his wife's stock in Inner City
Broadcasting Corp. valued at more than $250,000.
   The head of the New York-based entertainment company, Percy
Sutton, also made a loan to Jackson this year, and Jackson listed
under liabilities a promissory note for between $15,000 and $50,000.
   Sutton did not return a call seeking an explanation of the loan.
Jackson's campaign referred calls to his attorney, John Bustamante
of Cleveland. Bustamante did not return a message Tuesday.
   The Democratic candidate reported salary and wages $166,933 for
the past 15{ months, plus interest and dividends totaling between
$4,300 and $15,500.
   A family company headed by Jackson's wife, Jacqueline, provided
most of Jackson's wages, $105,000. The firm, Personalities
International, Inc., handles most of Jackson's speaking fees, and
he listed himself as an employee of the firm until last September.
   In addition, he reported $30,500 in honoraria paid directly to
him. The financial statement does not reflect specific wages of
Jackson's wife, Jacqueline, as their joint 1987 tax statement did.
   On their tax return they reported $159,000 in salary and wages
together, which an aide said was from Personalities International.
   The financial statement filed this week covered all of 1987 and
through April 13 this year. It said Mrs. Jackson and one of the
couple's children received salary of between $100,000 and $250,000
from Personalities International.
   Jackson reported earning $12,750 from the Rainbow Coalition, a
voter education organization he founded and headed until he began
running for president last fall.
   He also listed $2,000 in earnings for TV appearance compensation
from Talent and Residuals, Inc. of Chicago, and $16,683 in book
advance royalties from Fortress Press which published ``Straight
From the Heart,'' a collection of Jackson speeches.
   The financial reports do not include candidates' personal
residences. Jackson owns homes in Chicago and Washington, and his
mother's home in South Carolina.
   Jackson reported dividends for holdings in: Prudential-Bache
Money Mart Assets of Chicago, Calvert Social Investment Fund of
Washington and Commonwealth Edison, Common, of Chicago, plus
interest on accounts in seven banks and savings and loan
institutions.
   The honoraria Jackson received for speaking at various churches,
campuses and other organizations ranged from $100 to $5,000.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
question-and-answer session with reporters Tuesday.
   Reagan: Well, I have a statement here, a brief statement.
   First, I'm pleased that Senate Majority Leader Bob Byrd and
Republican leader Bob Dole have agreed to take up consideration of
the treaty to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   This treaty, which was signed last December, has placed
U.S.-Soviet arms discussions on a path that goes beyond arms
control and toward real nuclear arms reduction.
   I'm both hopeful and confident that, after careful
consideration, the Senate will agree that this treaty is a
diplomatic milestone, and will give its consent to United States
participation.
   Second, the March trade figures were good news, the best news on
this front since March of 1985.
   With the trade deficit dropping $4.1 billion, and with exports
up $5.4 billion, this is clear evidence that the trade balance is
improving, as our economy continues to grow.
   Now, several days ago, I received a trade bill from Congress.
   My message to Congress on this matter is currently under review,
and I expect to issue it within a couple of days.
   But today's news emphasizes what we've been saying all along,
that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on trade or
reducing incentives for free, open markets, or closing job
opportunities.
   We want more jobs, not less.
   And we want a job market open to all working men and women in
this country.
   I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work with the Congress
once again in crafting a trade bill that will continue this trend
of more job creation and greater economic growth.
   Q. Mr. President, why have you authorized the dropping of the
drug indictment against General Noriega? And doesn't that give the
Democrats ammunition for the presidential campaign?
   A. Not if they'll wait until there's something to be announced.
   We're negotiating right now, and therefore I can't comment on
negotiations that are under way.
   It'd be foolish to do so.
   Some things you have to keep to yourself when you're arguing
with someone else.
   But we're not _ I say, negotiations are under way.
   There has been no decision made on some of the things that are
being discussed.
   And I have to say that I think that much of what many of you
have been dealing with as a story is based on some kind of leaks or
misinformation, because there are no facts to sustain it.

<HEAD>New Instruments May Help Predict Rain and Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are testing a new way to gauge the
invisible water vapor in the air, a measurement that could clear up
some of the problems in predicting sudden storms.
   Their new device measures the weak microwaves given off by water
vapor, allowing them to calculate the amount of water in the air
above. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers
in Boulder, Colo., are using a radiometer to measure the radiation.
   Ed Westwater, a supervisory physicist at the NOAA Wave
Propagation Laboratory, said the readings are particularly helpful
in detecting sudden changes in moisture, such as when a front
passes through an area.
   The radiometer can measure the water vapor every two minutes,
and tests at Stapleton Airport in Denver have found occasions when
the amount rose or fell as much as four times in a half hour,
Westwater said.
   Knowing about a change like that can help a meteorologist trying
to predict whether rain or snow will occur, and when. It could be a
major factor in issuing a warning of a sudden storm, said the
researcher.
   Westwater said atmospheric water vapor typically has been
measured using balloons and satellites.
   The balloons give the most detail, radioing back the amount of
water vapor at different levels above the earth. But they are only
launched every 12 hours.
   Satellites can give continuous readings by measuring the
infrared radiation given off by water vapor. But they can't see
through clouds, so their readings often are unavailable, Westwater
said.
   While four of the microwave meters are undergoing tests, no
schedule for putting them into active operation has been set. Money
is among the problems.
   The machines cost nearly $100,000 each, but companies are
working on instruments which could sell for as little as $25,000,
Westwater said.

<HEAD>House Probe Developing Evidence Of Drug Deals Permitted To Help
Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration may have sanctioned
and in some cases recruited convicted drug traffickers in its
secret effort to aid the Nicaraguan Contras, a House subcommittee
chairman says.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., who chairs the House crime
subcommittee, said Tuesday the panel has uncovered ``a substantial
amount of evidence'' suggesting that the administration used known
drug criminals to secure guns for the rebels.
   He said there is no proof so far, but that he will air the issue
at public hearings next month.
   President Reagan said Tuesday he knows nothing about the alleged
operations. ``No one ever received or could get any evidence to
substantiate those rumors,'' Reagan said.
   Asked if he planned to check out the reports, Reagan said,
``Yes, we are.''
   Hughes said his subcommittee has examined a 3{-year period in
which administration officials either ignored or encouraged
criminal activity on behalf of the Contra rebels.
   ``There is distinct evidence of a pattern,'' Hughes said.
   He said the crime panel has uncovered repeated allegations of
federal agents recruiting or coercing criminals to work on behalf
of the Contras, who are trying to overthrow Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government. Sometimes, Hughes said, the criminals may
have been recruited as part of a plea bargain.
   Hughes said the allegations range from poor supervision of
federal drug cases to the ``possible use or abuse of the criminal
justice system '' in the Contras' behalf.
   Hughes said some operatives involved had ties to the Medellin
drug cartel of Colombia.
   Asked if administration officials had direct knowledge of the
illegal operations, Hughes replied: ``There would appear to be a
substantial amount of evidence to suggest that.'' He declined to
give specifics.
   While Hughes also declined to name names, he said, ``There is
some evidence that the (retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.) North
operation had some knowledge.'' North, a former Reagan national
security aide, has been charged with conspiring to divert Iran arms
sale profits to the Contras at a time when Congress banned such aid.
   Hughes also said the role of Attorney General Edwin Meese III
remains an ``open question.'' Meese has denied that he usurped
local jurisdiction in Contra-related investigations.
   Newsweek magazine on Sunday suggested that Vice President George
Bush's foreign policy aide, Donald Gregg, was the Washington
contact for an arms operation supplying the Contras with links to
drug dealers.
   Bush lashed out at the report Monday as ``old news ... not even
news.''
   White House and Justice Department spokesmen have denied
repeatedly any interference by the administration in local
investigations.
   Hughes said congressional investigators have interviewed
hundreds of witnesses, and served 30 or more subpoenas. The crime
panel has coordinated its activities with Lawrence E. Walsh, the
independent council in the Iran-Contra criminal investigation,
Hughes said.
   Among those compelled to testify was Jeffery Feldman, an
assistant U.S. attorney in Miami.
   Feldman met with subcommittee investigators in closed session in
July of last year. He also was questioned by investigators of the
congressional Iran-Contra committees.
   Feldman was the lead prosecutor in a 1985 case involving an
alleged gun running operation for the Contras.
   According to crime subcommittee records, Feldman and his
superior, Leon Kellner, the U.S. attorney in Miami, may have been
persuaded to delay the case on instructions from the Justice
Department. Meese has acknowledged discussing the case with
Kellner, but denies any attempt to sidetrack the investigation.
   There have been numerous allegations that the Contras have
helped support their war effort through drug running, and the
Reagan administration also has said the Sandinistas have done the
same.
   The crime subcommittee also is investigating possible
mishandling of the case of Barry Seal, an American who Hughes said
was involved in selling drugs to the Nicaraguan government.
   Reagan in 1986 used a photo taken by Seal to show what he
described as Sandinista officials involved in drug dealing. The
photo allegedly showed officials in the capital city of Managua
loading drugs onto an airplane bound for the United States.
   Hughes said a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigation
of Seal, who was later murdered in this country, may also have been
slowed deliberately.
   Reagan, in answering questions Tuesday about the overall
allegations, referred to the case.
   ``The only thing I knew is when we operated a sting operation
and found that the Sandinistas were shipping out drugs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Two rare musk oxen donated to China as
replacements for a pair that had been presented by Richard Nixon
but have since died are ready for a presentation ceremony, says the
woman organized the gift.
   The oxen ``had to stay in quarantine a month before we would
have the presentation ceremonies,'' Helen Miller said Tuesday as
she packed for her trip to the dedication at the Beijing Zoo.
``They've been over there a month and they've passed their tests.
   ``The ceremony is on the 23rd,'' she added, ``but I don't know
whether it's our 23rd or theirs. It's a day later going in that
direction.''
   Mrs. Miller, who planned to depart for China today, began a
campaign to replace the two oxen, which were presented to China in
1972 by then-President Nixon, after she learned in 1980 of their
deaths.
   The oxen, Milton and Matilda, were given to China in exchange
for two pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, that have become popular
attractions at the National Zoo in Washington.
   As part of her project, the Moultrie resident visited the
University of Alaska to view a herd of musk oxen, which are found
only in Greenland and arctic regions of North America. The oxen,
which have heavy fur coats and horns that curl below their heads
and then upward, were hunted relentlessly for years and are
considered an endangered species.
   Mrs. Miller, a retired construction company employee, persuaded
university officials to donate the oxen, named Koyuk and Tanana, to
China under a new U.S.-China bilateral agreement for the exchange
and preservation of rare and endangered plants and animals.
   ``This is going to be the first gift under this agreement,''
said Mrs. Miller. ``I've been working on this project for 7{ years,
so this agreement came along at just the perfect time.''

<HEAD>Infertility Treatment Expensive, Not Very Effective, Congress Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle against infertility is hampered by
a lack of accurate data about afflicted couples and the
effectiveness of some treatments, a government study says.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment said Tuesday
that Congress could require more data collection and sponsor the
development of voluntary professional guidelines, or extend
consumer protection laws to selected infertility services.
   Americans spent $1 billion last year to combat infertility, but
half of them ended up conceiving a child, the OTA said.
   The report said there are 2 million to 3 million infertile
couples in the United States, and it faulted the government for
failing to keep an accurate count.
   The report said couples can spend from a few hundred dollars up
to $22,000 on infertility diagnoses and treatments. It said many
private health insurers do not cover infertility, but doctors often
bill their patients in ways that enable them to qualify for
insurance payments.
   OTA said there is no federal regulation of fertility clinics or
treatments and, though there are voluntary professional guidelines,
quality of care varies widely.
   Nearly half the clinics doing in vitro fertilization have yet to
achieve a live birth, the report said. ``Couples seeking ... IVF
are often in a quandary over assessing practitioners' skills. Is
IVF experimental or is it a proven medical therapy? In 1988, no
blanket answer to that question is possible.''
   It said the government collects little data on factors
contributing to infertility and does not require reporting of
chlamydia, the most common sexually transmitted disease, which can
damage the female reproductive system.

   The accusation came during a news conference on Tuesday where
Eduardo Sanchez, one of the alleged conspirators, was presented to
reporters.
   Sanchez described the plot in a brief statement, then was
removed from the room. Reporters were not allowed to ask him
questions.
   In another development, the pro-Noriega newspaper La Republica
said on Tuesday the Treasury Ministry has prepared charges against
Panamanian consulate officials in London and four U.S. cities who
have remained loyal to Delvalle.
   According to Sanchez, another co-conspirator was Eduardo
Herrera, a lieutenant colonel in the Panamanian Defense Forces.
Herrera was retired in April when he refused orders to return home
from Israel, where he had been the Panamanian ambassador.
   Sanchez said he had spoken by telephone with Herrera to receive
instructions on a plan to oust Noriega, head of the 15,000-member
Defense Forces and Panama's de facto leader. Noriega was indicted
in Florida in February on federal drug-trafficking charges.
   Lucinio Miranda, secretary general of the National Department of
Investigations, told reporters at the news conference that Sanchez
and three others were arrested last week in connection with the
conspiracy.
   Miranda said that during the arrests, authorities seized a cache
of weapons including pistols, grenades, rifles and machine guns.
   ``We don't know what kind of support they had,'' Miranda said,
and added: ``They could be backed by Washington.''
   ``Absurd,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone told The
Associated Press about the alleged conspiracy. Kneebone said the
purported plot appeared ``to have been manufactured out of whole
cloth.''
   The Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on Panama
after the Noriega-dominated National Assembly on Feb. 26 ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle. The previous day Delvalle had tried
to fire Noriega. The United States still recognizes Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.
   La Republica said the diplomats that will be charged with
withholding from the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in
fees paid to them by people doing business with Panama. The
U.S.-imposed sanctions prohibit such people from transferring funds
to the Panamanian government.
   The newspaper said charges of embezzlement have been prepared
against the following consular officials: Alberto Garcia de
Paredes, New York; Jaime Trujillo, Atlanta; Santiago Torrijos
Lopez, Los Angeles; Alberto Dominguez, Miami, and Eduardo Arango,
London.
   Officials at the Treasury and Foreign ministries were
unavailable for comment on the report. Many Panamanian diplomats
abroad have remained loyal to Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama.
Other diplomatic missions have been taken over by officials
representing the acting chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma.

<HEAD>Ban on Private Lie Detector Tests Cleared for Final Passage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most lie detector tests for private employees
and job applicants would be prohibited under compromise legislation
approved unanimously by House and Senate negotiators.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., on Tuesday predicted swift,
overwhelming House approval of a measure he said would ``stop the
explosion, the epidemic of lie detector tests'' administered
annually to about 2 million private employees and job applicants.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, said the bill effectively would
prohibit as much as 85 percent of private polygraph tests. He
called the tests ``inaccurate instruments of intimidation.''
   The bill would not cover federal, state or local government
employees. It also would exempt private contractors involved in
government intelligence or national security work.
   Williams and other House negotiators accepted without dissent a
Senate amendment, sought by business interests and drafted in
consultation with organized labor, that would cover instances of
``economic loss or injury'' suffered by an employer.
   The amendment would allow employers to administer carefully
controlled lie detector tests as part of a theft investigation
within the company.
   The conditions for such tests are that the employee had access
to the stolen property, that the employer had a ``reasonable
suspicion'' that the worker was involved and that the employer give
details of the incident and evidence supporting the suspicions in a
written statement.
   Senate negotiators accepted a House provision allowing employers
to give polygraph tests to guards and other security personnel, as
well as employees handling certain controlled drugs, as long as
strict standards are met and the results are not the sole basis for
adverse action against an employee.
   Permissible tests would have to be administered under stringent
guidelines to be developed by the Labor Department which would
require that each test take at least 90 minutes and be conducted by
a licensed examiner.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said business executives'
opposition to the bill was overcome when they ``realized that these
quickie polygraph tests are inaccurate, unfair and very detrimental
to their employees.''
   The House approved the original bill, 254-158, last Nov. 4.
Williams said the House will act soon on the compromise measure and
send it to the Senate, which passed its version on March 3 by a
69-27 vote.
   At the time, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said that denying
employers the chance to screen job applicants will increase
workplace thefts and consumer costs.
   Judy Goldberg of the American Civil Liberties Union said the
compromise measure is ``an important step forward'' and will have
its biggest impact in the 28 states that either do not regulate
polygraph tests or only have licensing laws for examiners.

<HEAD>NASA Officials Say Test Firing Appears Successful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most severe test firing yet of a
redesigned space shuttle booster rocket appears to have been a
success, but NASA officials say they won't be certain until the
booster is disassembled.
   ``Everything we've seen in the whole program is looking very
positive,'' John McCarty, head of the Marshall Space Flight
Center's propulsion lab, said after Tuesday's test. ``It gives us a
lot of confidence.''
   The booster was redesigned after the space shuttle Challenger
exploded shortly after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, when exhaust burned
through a joint in one of the segmented boosters. The test, which
included intentionally flawed booster joints, had been postponed
from last week.
   Jim Thomas, technical assistant in the Marshall motor project
office, said the absence of bubbles in a bead of grease placed
outside the redesigned joints indicated they did not leak during
the test.
   The old joint design probably would have failed such a test,
McCarty said.
   The test was the fourth of 10 being conducted on the redesigned
rocket in preparation for August's shuttle launching. It was the
final test firing of a shortened version of the redesigned booster.
   Shuttle managers said the firing of the 52-foot-long booster at
Marshall was the most severe test yet of the redesigned joints.
   Two joints, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter joints,
were intentially flawed through as many as three layers of
insulation and seals, including the last seal intended to keep hot
exhaust gas from escaping.
   ``It shows the redesigned joints will seal even though we had
some pretty severe flaws,'' said Thomas.
   The firing, which lasted less than a second, generated 960
pounds of pressure and a temperature of more than 5,000 degrees
Fahrenheit inside the case. The nozzle end of the stack was plugged
for two minutes to allow gas to reach the joints.
   Thomas said the test was ``unprecedented in the solid rocket
motor industry.'' But he added the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration probably won't test-fire a full-length booster the
same way.
   The abbreviated booster tests show the design is ``tolerant to
flaws of this type,'' Thomas said.
   The fifth test of the redesigned booster is planned for the last
week of July, officials said. The tests began in November.

<TEXT>
   Alexander N. Pandis lived high _ plunking down
$32,000 for a Rolls Royce, jetting to Paris _ but federal
prosecutors say he made at least $500,000 from such scams as
selling rare musical instruments he had borrowed.
   Pandis, 25, of Chicago, pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District
Court to mail fraud and credit-card fraud for a series of cons _
including bilking his father out of $53,000 _ that began in 1983,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Foley.
   ``I'd describe him as obviously a very bright, intelligent
individual who chose to use his skills for illegal gain,'' Foley
said. ``It's actually a very unfortunate commentary on a kid who at
the age of 20 decided to perpetrate a fraud on various individuals
and made literally hundreds of thousands of dollars until he was
caught.''
   Pandis is to be sentenced July 6 and could face up to 15 years
in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   The most lucrative of his scams involved borrowing rare, antique
musical instruments, such as a 138-year-old Pierre Pacherelle
violin made in France, from one dealer and selling them at bargain
prices to another, Foley said.
   ``There is a common practice in the industry to lend rare
instruments to people so they can try them out in their homes or
their studios,'' the prosecutor said.
   Pandis, posing as an investment counselor and lawyer, told the
dealers that his clients wanted to buy their rare violins, violas
and violin bows as investments, but asked to inspect them first.
   He never returned the instruments and made about $250,000 by
selling them to other, unsuspecting dealers, Foley said.
   Pandis was arrested Jan. 27 on a federal complaint and indicted
Feb. 26.
   He used the illict profits for such things as a $32,000 Rolls
Royce and taking trips to Paris, London and Los Angeles, Foley said.
   In December 1985, the indictment said, Pandis persuaded an
elderly woman to close her personal money market account and let
him manage about $100,000 of her money, Foley said.
   Pandis spent most of the money on himself, the indictment
contends.
   He also is accused of stealing more than $40,000 from his
father's individual retirement account and obtaining $13,000 in
loans using his father's life insurance policy as collateral.
   In another scheme, Pandis set up his own investment counseling
firm in 1986 and sold $85,000 worth of bogus, high-interest bonds
to 10 investors, Foley said.
   ``One thing led to another,'' Foley said. ``Once he ran out of
juice on one thing, he moved on to another. The final item was the
musical instruments, which was probably his greatest coup and
netted him about $250,000.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's armed forces chief
said Rigoberto Regalado Lara, a Honduran diplomat being held in
Miami on drug smuggling charges, also will be prosecuted in
Honduras. The two men are half brothers.
   ``The law is the same for everyone and, independently of the
ruling in the United States, we also will judge him in Honduras,''
Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez told reporters on Tuesday.
   ``We will apply the full weight of the law without conditions of
any nature,'' he said. The two were born to the same father of
different mothers.
   Regalado Lara, Honduras' ambassador to Panama, was arrested at
Miami International Airport on Sunday after arriving from
Tegucigalpa.
   He was allegedly caught with nearly 26 pounds of cocaine in his
luggage that the U.S. Customs Service said was packed in coffee to
mask its smell from specially trained drug-sniffing dogs.
   Regalado Lara, 49, is being held without bond pending a court
hearing. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry suspended his appointment
as ambassador and his diplomatic immunity.
   The diplomat was called home after Panama's de facto leader,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, had President Eric Arturo Delvalle
deposed as president on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega as Defense Forces chief.
   Three months ago, Regalado Lara spoke out in defense of Noriega,
who was indicted by a federal grand juries in Florida in February
on drug-trafficking and money laundering charges. He told reporters
Noriega had acted legally.
   Regalado Lara, a retired lieutenant colonel, has served as head
of the 1st Artillery Battalion, the 2nd Air Infantry Battalion and
the Regional Military Training Center, a school founded in 1984 by
the United States for counterinsurgency training and closed in 1986.
   He also has been ambassador to Nicaragua and military attache in
Guatemala.
   Regalado Lara, a master parachutist with more than 350 jumps,
also was president of the National Emergency Committee, a state
panel that operates during disasters.
   In 1975, Regalado Lara led a movement of young officers that
deposed Gen. Oswaldo Lopez Arellano as chief of state. The rebels
accused him of receiving a $2.5 million bribe they said United
Brands offered to reduce a banana export tax.

<HEAD>Congressmen: Soviets Sound Less Defensive On Emigration Questions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets are willing to discuss easing
Jewish emigration restrictions and improving human rights, ``but we
are awaiting action,'' says one of eight members of Congress who
met with a top Soviet Embassy official.
   ``We've heard some better talk; what we want to see is better
action,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who organized the
hour-long meeting Tuesday with Nicolay D. Smirnov, the embassy's
first secretary.
   Figures from the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, based in
New York, show 1,086 Jews departed from the Soviet Union in April,
the highest monthly total in nearly seven years, The New York Times
reported today.
   The last time more than 1,000 were allowed to leave in one month
was in May 1981, when 1,141 departed. The pace of Jewish emigration
began to rise last year after declining sharply from a peak in
1979, when the monthly average was more than 4,000, the Times said.
   However, Schumer detailed ``new procedural obstacles'' to
emigration which he said demonstrate an escalated campaign to deny
Soviet Jews the right to leave.
   He said the Soviet government has reimposed a ``first-degree
relative'' restriction which mandates that anyone wishing to
emigrate must produce an invitation from an immediate family member
living abroad.
   ``Thus, when strictly enforced, the 90 percent of Soviet Jews
who have no relatives abroad have no chance to emigrate,'' Schumer
said in a statement.
   ``We've heard talk of loosening things up,'' he said, ``but we
are awaiting action.''
   Others at the meeting at the Soviet Embassy were Reps. Louise
Slaughter, D-N.Y.; Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.; John Miller, R-Wash.;
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Constance Morella, R-Md.; Steny Hoyer,
D-Md.; and Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.
   ``I think the one positive that I picked up on is they seem a
lot less defensive than they used to be,'' said Boxer. ``They
admitted that their country isn't perfect, they alluded to the fact
that for the first time, there's more criticism in the press about
the problems that they're having.''
   The representatives declined to say much about the content of
the talks but Gilman characterized the meeting as ``a good, open
and frank discussion of a number of problems.''
   Soviet Embassy officials did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>Dollar Up A Bit, Stocks Down After Two Days Of Record Highs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground today against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo, while stock prices fell back for the first time in
five trading days following an overnight downswing on Wall Street.
   The dollar closed at 125.53 yen, up 0.71 yen from Tuesday's
finish, but slightly lower than its opening level of 125.60 yen.
   ``Trading was scattered throughout the day as market
participants stayed on the sidelines,'' said a dealer with a major
commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A sense of disappointment that the dollar did not rise high
enough in overseas markets, despite the dramatically improved U.S.
trade performance in March, prevented participants from placing
major orders, he said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the nation's
trade deficit fell more than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion,
the lowest monthly finish since March 1985.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 60.11 points Tuesday to close at a
record high, shed 52.40 points, or 0.18 percent, finishing the
day's session at 27,767.58.
   ``The overnight slump on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
Average of 30 industrials slipped back below the $2,000 level, and
fears over rising inflation in the U.S. pulled back the Tokyo
market,'' said one brokerage official, also speaking anonymously.
   It is also time for the market to adjust itself after rising
almost 660 points over the past four trading days, he said.
   The Nikkei index, the market's key barometer, closed at Tuesday
27,819.98 points, surpassing the previous record closing of
27,759.87 points registered Monday.
   Investors are concerned that rapid economic growth in the United
States could lead to higher interest rates, which in turn could
lead to declines in New York stocks, traders said.
   Popular issues included steels, non-ferrous metals and trading
houses. Drugs, precision machineries, papers, and certain
foodstuffs and electricals lost ground.
   Trading was moderately active with volume in the first section
of trading estimated at 1.2 billion shares, up from the 1.1 billion
shares which changed hands Tuesday.

   An AIDS victim fired from his clerk-typist job
at the Justice Department is turning down a one-year temporary
position offered to him in the wake of publicity about the incident.
   ``I'm not going to accept,'' Mark Gregory said at a
congressional hearing Tuesday. ``They owe me my job back. They
fired me because I had AIDS.''
   Gregory said he has taken 30 days off since learning last
October that he has AIDS-related complex, a precursor to full-blown
AIDS _ nearly half of the time to participate in a treatment study
at the National Institutes of Health. Gregory was fired April 25 on
the grounds that his absences made him incapable of performing his
job.
   The firing came several weeks after the Office of Personnel
Management had instituted a policy saying federal workers with AIDS
had to be treated like those with other serious medical problems
and could not be discriminated against.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairman of the House civil
service subcommittee, said ``a newly stated, enlightened policy ...
appears to have been thrown overboard within the first month.''
   ``We will not let this go,'' she said. ``We want to make sure

   Catholic University professor the Rev. Charles
Curran, charges the university has effectively fired him by
refusing to offer him a position in his specialty ``with no strings
attached.''
   Curran, whose breach of contract lawsuit against the school is
scheduled to go to trial in September in District of Columbia
Superior Court, told reporters Tuesday he has added illegal
termination to his charges against the school.
   The Vatican in 1986 barred Curran from teaching Catholic moral
theology because his views on birth control, divorce and
homosexuality differ from those taught by the church. Washington,
D.C., Archbishop James A. Hickey suspended him from teaching at
Catholic University the following January.
   Last month the University's board of trustees stripped Curran of
his canonical mission, thereby prohibiting him from teaching in the
Department of Theology, of which he'd been a member for more than
20 years.

<TEXT>
   A Federal Aviation Administration report says
Scott Air Force Base in Illinois could be expanded to permit
civilian use, but the Defense Department is expressing doubts about
the findings.
   ``Joint use offers a practical solution to congestion in the St.
Louis air traffic hub, which otherwise threatens to become a
bottleneck, constraining the flow of air traffic across the
nation,'' the FAA said.
   The study said in a study it would be feasible to expand the
base for joint military-civilian use by adding a 10,000-foot runway
and a civilian terminal.
   It estimated the cost at $250 million and said the project would
take about three to five years to complete.
   In a response to the civilian agency's study, the Department of
Defense said it ``is not opposed to the principle of joint use of
its airfields. However, the decision for or against joint use must
be a deliberate and comprehensive process, not just an evaluation
of `technical feasibility.'''
   The base, located 20 miles east of downtown St. Louis near
Belleville, Ill., is headquarters for the U.S. Transportation
Command, Military Airlift Command and Air Force Communications
Command.

<HEAD>Japanese-Owned Tanker Set Ablaze By Iranian Gunboats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Iranian speedboats attacked a
Japanese-owned chemical carrier in the Strait of Hormuz today,
setting it ablaze and forcing its crew to abandon the vessel,
shipping sources said.
   The 6,730-ton craft, the Panamanian-flagged Ace Chemi, put out a
distress signal at 8 a.m. (midnight EDT Tuesday), according to the
gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``May Day! May Day! We are under attack. We are being approached
by four gunboats,'' radio monitors heard a voice from the Ace Chemi
shouting, the executives said. Only three of the gunboats attacked,
the executives said.
   A salvage tugboat that was in the vicinity picked up the seamen
and brought the fire aboard the carrier under control, they said.
The tugboat then began towing the vessel through the strait, into
the gulf, they said. It was not immediately clear what chemical, if
any, the ship was carrying.
   Iran had not attacked neutral ships in the gulf since
Washington's new policy went into effect May 3, allowing the U.S.
Navy to help merchant vessels attacked by Iran even if they were
not sailing under the Stars and Stripes. Before the policy, the
Navy only protected U.S.-flagged ships.
   It was unclear if any American or other warship was near Hormuz,
the gulf's only outlet, when the Iranians struck today.
   Washington's get-tough policy was adopted after the Navy's most
serious clash with the Iranians in the gulf on April 18.
   During that engagement, the Navy sank or damaged six Iranian
gunboats and destroyed two oil platforms. The action was meant as
punishment for a mine explosion in the gulf the previous week that
injured 10 U.S. sailors and blew a hole in a Navy frigate. The
United States charged that Iran planted the mine.
   The last victim of Iranian gunboat attacks on neutral shipping
in the gulf was the Saudi Arabian-owned Sea Trader. After that
attack, Saudi Arabia broke relations with Tehran on April 26.
   Iran generally retaliates for Iraqi air raid attacks on its own
tankers on a ship-for-ship basis. Since April 29, Iraq has hit at
least 10 vessels owned by or doing business with Iran in an
escalated campaign to throttle its gulf enemy's oil-based economy.
   On Tuesday, explosions tore through a crippled Spanish
supertanker at Iran's Larak island oil terminal, and an unknown
number of tugboat crewmen battling fires on the ship were reported
killed or missing and feared dead.
   The blast partially sank the 235,000-ton Barcelona, one of five
ships damaged in a devastating, long-distance raid on the terminal
by Iraqi warplanes at the weekend. The toll of dead and missing
stood unofficially at 22.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London said four tugs were
attending the stricken Barcelona at the time of the blast.
   It reported ``all crew lost'' aboard the tugboat Scan Force and
three dead on the tug Beaufort, while the tugs Safir and Ferdinand
Verbiest were damaged.

   An appeals court's ruling that affirms the
tax-free export of documentary films is a victory for free speech
and for makers of movies on controversial topics such as nuclear
arms and Nicaragua, filmmakers' lawyers say.
   The government's attempt to ban the tax-free export of films
that advocate a cause or seek to influence government policy was
struck down Tuesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
called the restriction a ``virtual license to engage in
censorship.''
   The court ruled 3-0 that U.S. Information Agency regulations
governing the worldwide distribution of thousands of films each
year violate the constitutional right of freedom of speech by
discriminating on the basis of content.
   ``This is a great victory for the First Amendment and obviously
important for filmmakers, many of whom have lost significant
amounts of money'' because of the export restrictions, said David
Lerner, spokesman for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which
represented the filmmakers.
   The ruling was the second victory in less than a week for
independent filmmakers, who need the agency's approval to qualify
for an exemption from foreign nations' import taxes.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima of Los Angeles declared
last Friday that rewritten rules allowing the agency to label some
exported films ``propaganda'' also were unconstitutional. Tashima's
1986 ruling invalidating the agency's original labeling regulations
was upheld by Tuesday's ruling.
   Tashima ordered the USIA to draft a third set of rules that do
not discriminate on the basis of content and to grant approval to
six films whose producers had filed the suit.
   The films include ``From the Ashes,'' a sympathetic portrayal of
the 1979 Nicaraguan revolution; ``In Our Own Backyards,'' on the
dangers of uranium mining, and ``Whatever Happened to Childhood?,''
on drug problems among children.
   The USIA and the Justice Department declined to comment on both
rulings.
   The USIA regulations implement a 1954 treaty, signed by about 60
nations, that exempts films from import fees if both the exporting
and importing nation certify the film's educational content.
   ``The USIA forces filmmakers to choose between exercising their
right to free speech and foregoing benefits ... or curtailing their
speech and obtaining the benefits,'' said Tuesday's opinion by
Judge Cecil Poole.
   Noting that the USIA has approved a pro-nuclear power film while
rejecting the film on the dangers of uranium mining, Poole said
both the regulations and the agency's practices ``seem to
disapprove materials that criticize and approve those that accept
the prevailing state of affairs.''
   He rejected the USIA's argument that the court should defer to
the government on decisions that involve ``the delicate area of
foreign relations.'' Constitutional protections apply equally to
speech that is directed abroad, he said.

<HEAD>Investigators Plan To Resume Digging At Suspected Mob Burial Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators hope the discovery of a burial
ground they believe was used by mob hit men will lead to an
egg-sized diamond once owned by the family of Sir Winston Churchill
and stolen eight years ago, a newspaper reported today.
   Joseph Scalise, an underworld jack-of-all-trades imprisoned in
Great Britain, was convicted of stealing the $960,000 Marlborough
diamond, a 45-carat gem, and authorities believe he mailed it from
London to the United States, the Chicago Tribune reported, quoting
unidentified sources.
   His home sits about 50 yards from the site where investigators
dug up one body Monday. Authorities plan to resume digging today.
   The search for the diamond led investigators to the secret
burial ground in rural Du Page County west of Chicago, the
newspaper said.
   Forensic experts from the FBI crime lab in Washington arrived
Tuesday to help identify the badly decomposed remains unearthed
from a grave after excavations began Monday, said FBI spokesman Bob
Long.
   Digging was suspended Tuesday until the team and officials from
the county coroner's office finished examining the gravesite for
evidence and removed the remains.
   Scalise, 48, is serving a 16-year sentence for the 1980 London
jewel store heist in which the Marlborough diamond and $2.6 million
worth of other jewelry were taken.
   FBI agents recently traveled to Britain to question Scalise and
another reputed Chicago mobster, Arthur Rachel, who is imprisoned
there, the Tribune reported.
   Investigators suspect the deserted field near the Argonne
National Laboratory was used as a graveyard by mob hit men during
the city's chop-shop wars of the 1970s, when the mob seized control
of the stolen auto-parts trade.
   Several scrap dealers suspected of trying to deal independently
in stolen auto parts disappeared at the time and investigators
believe the skeleton found Monday may be one of them, the Tribune
reported.
   Unidentified police sources told the newspaper they discovered
clues pointing to the makeshift graveyard's existence during their
search for the Marlborough diamond.
   British police learned that on the day of the robbery, Scalise,
a reputed crime-syndicate enforcer, mailed a package from a London
post office. Authorities believe it contained the stolen jewelry,
but have never discovered to whom the package was addressed.
   When Scalise and his accomplice, Rachel, went to prison without
revealing what they did with the loot, authorities interviewed
their associates, including underworld informers, the newspaper
said.
   None had much to say about the diamond, but several provided
information about the burial ground, the newspaper reported.
   On Tuesday, investigators sifted the soil around the gravesite
for fragmentary evidence and used metal detectors. They also took
soil samples to determine where else the ground might have been dug
up.
   Long said investigators would continue digging through the end
of the week.

<TEXT>
   Events in the Persian Gulf
have shown that the 37 sailors killed there a year ago on the USS
Stark did not die in vain, the commander of the frigate's home port
said at a memorial service.
   Capt. John B. Mitchell Jr., commander of the Mayport Naval
Station, told 140 relatives who attended the dockside anniversary
service Tuesday that the reason for the observance was engraved on
the stone and bronze monument next to him: ``You will never be
forgotten...''
   Mitchell also quoted the commanding officer of another Navy ship
recently damaged by a mine in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The superb crew of USS Stark taught us the essence of bravery,
professionalism and persistence,'' Mitchell quoted Cmdr. Paul X.
Rinn, the skipper of the USS Samuel B. Roberts, as saying. ``Their
sacrifice ... gave us an example to follow. Their loss is without a
doubt the predominant factor responsible for our survival.''
   One parent at the memorial service, Rodney Erwin, recalled
tearfully how much his son loved boats. Another, Karen Welch, held
her head up, smiled and said proudly, ``My son is still as close to
me now as he was before he went off to sea.''
   Erwin of Troy, Mich., lost his 22-year-old son, Seaman Steven T.
Erwin, in the attack by an Iraqi warplane in the Persian Gulf on
May 17, 1987. Mrs. Welch, from Flint, Mich., lost her 20-year-old
son, Petty Officer Kelly R. Quick.
   Following the service, many of the relatives boarded the Stark's
sister ship, USS Antrim, for a 5-mile voyage out to the Atlantic to
drop a symbolic wreath in the ocean.
   Hugging each other and crying, the relatives of the dead sailors
each dropped two yellow roses in the sea before returning to port.
   Similar observances were held in Pascagoula, Miss., where the
Stark is undergoing a $100 million overhaul; in Washington; in the
Persian Gulf and aboard many Navy ships and installations around
the world.
   Except for the shipboard ceremonies that followed the memorial
services, there were few tears. Flags on the base and aboard ship
flew at half-mast, and the echo of taps wafted far out at sea
following a 21-gun salute by an honor guard.
   Seaman John K. Lampkin, 22, sat during the services with eight
members of the family of Seaman Vincent Ulmer, another of the
Stark's victims.
   ``We were best friends. Played basketball together. Joined the
Navy together. Came here together,'' said Lampkin, who is a crewman
aboard the USS Gallery, the same type of ship as the Stark.
   Lampkin said he returned from the Persian Gulf in March and was
due to return soon.
   ``It's very scary. I still worry about it,'' he said.
   Chief Petty Officer Lawrence H. Barrow, the Stark's operations
chief, was one of two surviving Stark crewmen chosen to commit the
memorial wreath to the sea.
   ``I was a little apprehensive about this (ceremony) at first. I
had a lot of anxiety,'' said Barrow. ``But I think it's been
beneficial for all. I know I feel better, remembering them.''
   Barrow, agreeing with the base commander that ``some good has
come from the Stark attack,'' said there is a ``heightened
awareness'' throughout the Navy of what can happen.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Despite Loss, Oregon Vote Share Was `Mandate For
Change'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson brushed aside a primary loss to Michael Dukakis in Oregon,
concentrating instead on the improvement over his showing in the
state four years ago.
   Although he trailed the Massachusetts governor by nearly 20
percentage points in Oregon, Jackson expressed satisfaction with
his showing.
   ``We have done 3{ times better than in 1984,'' he told
supporters at a Hollywood hotel. ``For us, it's a mandate for
change.''
   Jackson, who has slipped far behind Dukakis in the delegate
race, implied that his rival is being prematurely crowned the
victor in the fight for the nomination.
   Asked why Dukakis did so well in Oregon when he himself spent
much more time and money in the state, he replied tartly: ``I would
assume he is riding right now on the crest of his hidden assets ...
the assessment of the pundits of the inevitability (of winning the
nomination.)''
   Jackson's aides have indicated he will make an all-out effort in
the campaign leading up to California's primary, less than three
weeks away. But polls are suggesting he has an uphill fight on his
hands.
   A Los Angeles Times poll published today indicated Dukakis led
Jackson 2-1. According to the poll of 713 Democrats questioned by
telephone over six days ending Monday, Dukakis was favored by 61
percent, Jackson 30 percent, with 5 percent undecided. The margin
of error was 5 percentage points either way, the newspaper said.
   Nonetheless, Jackson told backers: ``We look forward to
California,'' and added, ``Though we struggle against the odds, we
will not surrender.''
   Jackson, asked if he had any realistic chance of stopping
Dukakis, replied: ``We'll all know standing right here the night of
June 7.''
   New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico hold primaries along with
California that day, wrapping up the Democratic primary season.
   Jackson, whose relations with the Jewish community have
sometimes been strained, was meeting with Jewish leaders today.
   Jackson offended many Jews in 1984 with his reference to New
York as ``Hymietown'' and his association with Muslim leader Louis
Farrakhan. Jewish groups have also expressed concern over what they
see as Jackson's tilt toward the Arabs.
   Today's session at a Hollywood hotel was being attended by about
40 people, organizers said. But some Jewish leaders boycotted the
session, with some complaining that the meeting would be closed.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is a solid
choice of southern Democratic party leaders as a running mate for
likely presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, according to
interviews by The Charlotte Observer.
   The party officials, in 14 Southern and border states, also say
a ticket including Jesse Jackson would hurt Dukakis in their
states, although most say promising Jackson a key but lesser in a
Democratic administration would help.
   The 11 Southern states and three border states _ Kentucky,
Missouri and West Virginia _ offer 164 electoral votes, 30 percent
of the total and more than half the 270 needed for nomination.
   Officials in seven states want Nunn as their first choice. Those
in four others rank him second to favorite sons: Sens. Bob Graham
in Florida, Lloyd Bentsen in Texas, Albert Gore Jr. in Tennessee
and Rep. Richard Gephardt in Missouri.

<HEAD>Former President Says Dukakis `Will Do Well' Against Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLIJAY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Carter described Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``highly competent'' on Tuesday and
said Dukakis would fare well against Republican George Bush in the
Nov. 8 presidential election.
   ``I know him well. He and I were governors together,'' said
Carter, who was governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and won the
presidency in 1976.
   ``I think among all the governors, he would be voted one of the
top ones in administrative ability, in vision and competence and
sound judgment,'' Carter said Tuesday.
   Carter said Dukakis ``he will do well'' against Bush.
   As a former Democratic president, Carter is a delegate to the
convention in Atlanta this summer. He said he plans to go to the
convention as an uncommitted delegate because he told the
candidates earlier that he would not choose among them until the
convention.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, relying heavily on the
latest in political humor _ astrology jokes _ appeared at a
birthday party for Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, saying that if he wins,
``this state will be blessed with a great new governor.''
   Dukakis asked the crowd Tuesday night, ``Is there anyone in this
room who doubts who Evelyn Murphy really wants to be the next
president?''
   About 300 people attended the fund-raising event for Murphy,
which marked her 48th birthday. Dukakis appeared about an hour
after the party began and spoke for about five minutes.
   ``But who knows what fate has in store for me,'' he said. ``I
asked an astrologer about the future. She said Ed Meese and I both
will be changing our positions soon.''
   Astrology jokes, predicted Dukakis, ``will be in season'' during
his campaign, even though ``you're looking at a guy that doesn't
know a horoscope from a telescope.''

   A strong earthquake today shook floors and
rattled dishes in homes on the western island of Cefalonia, but
authorities said there were no immediate reports of damage or
injuries.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the tremor measured 5.8
on the Richter scale and occurred at 8:17 a.m. (1:17 a.m. EDT). Its
epicenter was in the Ionian seabed 190 miles west of Athens and
just off Cefalonia.
   The quake was felt throughout the Ionian island chain off
western Greece and along the coast, a police spokesman in the port
city of Patras said.
   ``It felt really strong and there were three or four
after-shocks,'' said a police officer in Cefalonia who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake measuring 6 on the scale can cause
severe damage.

   A student pilot who witnessed an
airplane crash that killed five people said the aircraft's lone
engine appeared to stall moments before it plunged nose first into
the ground.
   ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' said Walter Ramazzini Jr.,
17, who was sitting about 100 yards from the ditch where the plane
crashed on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
   ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,''
Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left.''
   Police Sgt. R.C. Porter said it was raining when the plane
crashed Tuesday afternoon several miles south of Coronado Airport.
   The pilot of the six-seat Cessna P210 aborted his first landing
attempt and was coming in for a second try when it crashed, Porter
said.
   State police identified the victims as Gary Brown, 31, his wife,
Melissa, 26, and their 2-year-old daughter, Lindsey, all of
Albuquerque; and his parents, Wayne Brown, 60, and Joyce Brown, 58,
of Salt Lake City.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal
Aviation Administration were investigating the crash.
   After the wind hit the plane, the pilot appeared to try to
straighten out the craft, Ramazzini said
   ``The wind made him bank to the left 30 degrees or so. To
correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed
level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said.
   ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and
went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini. ``He hit the
ground and cartwheeled over. It seemed like the engine stalled.''
   The airplane ``wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet,'' Ramazzini
said.
   Three fire trucks sent to the scene sprayed the crumpled
airplane with water and rescue crews removed bodies from the craft,
authorities said.

   Voters approved a plan to let Denver
annex land for a new $3 billion airport that would be the first
major U.S. airport since 1974 and bring relief to one of the
country's most congested hubs.
   The vote from Adams County's 164 precincts in Tuesday's special
election was 34,070 or 55.9 percent for annexation and 26,928 or
44.1 percent against.
   If the vote is certified by the county clerk and the secretary
of state, 45 square miles of unincorporated county land 10 miles
northeast of Stapleton International Airport will be annexed by
Denver, probably within 10 days, officials said.
   ``This is the rocket booster that pushes the airport project
forward,'' said a jubilant Denver Mayor Federico Pena after the
election.
   Pena said city officials would direct their energies to
finishing an environmental impact statement required by the Federal
Aviation Administration before construction of the airport, which
the FAA says could be the nation's second-busiest by the year 2000.
   The FAA supported the proposed airport because Stapleton, the
world's fifth-busiest airport, already is congested and is expected
to lead the nation in flight delays by 1996.
   Proponents, who devoted more than $1 million to the campaign,
outspending foes by about 10-to-1, said the airport would boost
Colorado's economy and provide jobs. They said development would
mean property tax relief.
   Opponents argued that closing Stapleton would be a waste of
money. They were concerned about increased air pollution, jet noise
over homes, and the effects on the 2,700-acre Barr Lake State Park
bird refuge near Brighton.
   The new airport is the first planned in the United States since
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport opened in 1974.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government
has convened an unprecedented national congress to rally local
leaders in its struggle to keep villages and communes from falling
into the hands of guerrillas.
   The official Communist Party newspaper Pracheachon (The People)
said cadres of about 500 model communes across Cambodia opened the
congress in Phnom Penh Monday to discuss how to strengthen local
defenses.
   The paper said the party's ruling Politburo, ``considers the
localities as a matter of life or death to the revolution ... as
the core battlefield, and the work of building and consolidating
localities, villages, communes, units and army bases as the key
task in 1988.''
   A text of the editorial, which was quoted by the official
domestic radio Tuesday, was obtained from a Western embassy in
Bangkok today.
   The paper said the government continues to have problems
countering the propaganda war the guerrillas mounted after
Vietnamese forces backing Phnom Penh overran all major guerrilla
bases along the Thai border in 1984-85.
   Vietnam invaded the country in late 1978 and is regarded with
deep-seated enmity by many Cambodians. But people also fear the
return of the Khmer Rouge, who comprise the largest guerrilla group
in the Cambodian resistance.
   The Vietnamese ousted the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of people during its three-year rule.
   On May 10, Khmer Rouge radio claimed guerrillas smashed the
Vietnamese administrative network in more than 4,000 villages and
200 communes during the seven-month dry season that ended in April.
   Claims by the Khmer Rouge, however, are widely regarded as
exaggerated.
   Pracheachon said the guerrillas were planting ``secret agents''
and preparing for 1990, when Vietnam has said it will withdraw the
last of its troops from Cambodia.
   ``The militia and police forces in a number of localities do not
act as a real support for the people in attacks against the
enemy,'' it said.
   ``The people's living conditions there remain primitive (and)
have not improved ... The party and state policy has not reached
the people, causing a number of them to be misguided by enemy
propaganda. Many of them are even helping in enemy maneuvers.''
   Khmer Rouge radio has said the guerrillas, working in small
groups, use villagers' homes as support bases and hiding places.
   Phnom Penh has been trying with its propaganda to lure
guerrillas and their supporters back into the fold with promises of
amnesty, jobs and rewards.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of South Korea's three
main opposition parties today urged the government of Roh Tae-woo
to resume talks aimed at persuading North Korea to enter the Summer
Olympics.
   They made the call in a meeting to discuss a common
parliamentary strategy for dealing with the Roh government, a joint
announcement said.
   Leading dissidents and anti-government students also have called
for talks to bring the north into the Seoul games, which begin
Sept. 17.
   There was no immediate government reaction to the opposition
call.
   But on Monday, Park Seh-jik, president of the Seoul Olympic
Organizing Committee, expressed a willingness to allow North Korean
participation ``if the International Olympic Committee, other
Olympic families and the Korean people want to do so.'' He said he
would even go to Pyongyang for such talks.
   Today's meeting among Kim Dae-jung of the largest opposition
Peace and Democracy party, Kim Young-sam of the Reunification
Democratic Party and Kim Jong-pil of the New Democratic Republican
Party, was their first since the opposition won an unprecedented
majority in the National Assembly on April 26.
   The three Kims urged the government to ``make utmost efforts and
show generosity'' in negotiating with the north for its entry in
the Olympics. They said the games should be made ``a new turning
point'' for reunification of the communist north and capitalist
south, which have been divided for 43 years.
   After several rounds of unsuccessful talks with South Korea and
the International Olympic Committee, the north decided to boycott
the games unless it was made co-host.
   Despite fears by some that the north might try to sabotage the
games, a record 161 countries, including North Korean allies China
and the Soviet Union, have accepted invitations to enter.
   The International Olympic Committee, with the south's consent,
offered to let the north stage some events while rejecting the
co-host demand. Pyongyang claims that making Seoul the exclusive
host would hinder Korean reunification.
   Kim Dae-jung today urged that efforts be made, in the interests
of north-south reconciliation, to form a unified Korean Olympic
team and suggested considering offering the north virtual co-host
status, his aides said.
   On other major domestic issues, the three Kims agreed to push
for the formation of several special committees in the legislature
to investigate corruption and the government's violent suppression
of the 1980 Kwangju civil uprising, their statement said.
   They also urged the government to release all political
prisoners and pledged anew to work for parliamentary democracy
through dialogue and compromise.

   A pastor charged with raping two teen-age
members of his church told female worshipers they could end up in
hell if they refused his sexual advances, and controlled many
members' savings accounts, officials say.
   Law enforcement officials have spent two years investigating the
tangled finances of the Rev. Thomas Streitferdt, who lives with his
wife on a $1.1 million Long Island estate that is tax-exempt
because it is used as a parsonage.
   Streitferdt, 59, is free in $25,000 bail after he was arraigned
Monday on two counts each of first-degree rape and first-degree
sodomy involving two sisters, ages 14 and 16.
   The pastor, who is white, founded his nondenominational True
Church of God in a Harlem storefront in 1964, officials said. The
church, whose members are mostly black, now takes up an entire
block and features a highly regarded grade school and day-care
center.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Tuesday that
Streitferdt required his 700 members to pay him 10 percent of their
annual income. The practice, known as tithing, is common among
fundamentalist sects and is not illegal. Every third year,
Streitferdt demanded 30 percent, the sources said.
   The sources said Streitferdt took complete personal charge of
the savings accounts of many members of his church and offered them
other banking services.
   The information about Streitferdt's unusual financial activities
was provided by records and unhappy church members during a
two-year probe, the sources said.
   Streitferdt's lawyer, Benjamin Herzweig, said his client was not
a wealthy manipulator. ``He is meticulous,'' he said. ``He crosses
his t's, dots his i's, and does everything by the book. On paper,
he's worth zero.''
   Herzweig said Streitferdt and his family were ``shocked'' by the
sexual misconduct allegations.
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Charles Solomon scheduled a
hearing for Friday when, the sources said, a grand jury will hear
rape and sodomy charges against Streitferdt.
   The judge also ordered Streitferdt to surrender his passport
after Assistant District Attorney Karen Silberman said the pastor
planned to flee.
   The prosecutor hinted that new charges could be forthcoming
against Streitferdt because a third woman had alleged he forced her
to have sex with him during a marriage instruction class a week
before she was to be married.
   Ms. Silberman told Solomon that Streitferdt had sexual relations
with ``numerous'' adult members of his congregation over ``a period
of time.'' She said the pastor told women worshipers they could end
up in hell if they refused to have sex with him.

   Thunderstorms boomed over the central High Plains today after
unleashing a tornado and hail as big as golf balls in Nebraska,
while rain fell from Florida to New England.
   Strong thunderstorms developed in the Nebraska Panhandle as
showers and thunderstorms continued over southern Nebraska and
northern and western Kansas.
   Showers were scattered over the southern Rockies and the
northern High Plains.
   Showers lingered from New England to Virginia, and showers and a
few thunderstorms fell along the East Coast from North Carolina to
northeast Florida. Cloudy skies and scattered showers dampened
Washingon state and Oregon. Fair skies prevailed across the rest of
the nation.
   In Nebraska on Tuesday, the storms produced a tornado that
touched down a mile or two southeast of Harrisburg in the
Panhandle, but no damage was reported. Golf ball-size hail fell in
Oconto in the central section of the state.
   Winds gusted to 49 mph in Goodland in northwest Kansas.
Thunderstorms dropped large hail on the Carolinas.
   High-temperature records were set in seven Southern or
Midwestern cities and tied in four.
   It was 94 degrees in Texarkana, Ark., where the old record of 93
was set in 1913. Records were also set in New Orleans, Mobile,
Ala.; Monroe, La.; Pensacola, Fla.; Rapid City, S.D.; and Fort
Smith, Ark. Records were tied in Apalachicola, Fla.; Baton Rouge,
La.; El Dorado, Ark.; and Lake Charles, La.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over central and southern Florida, from New England to the Middle
Atlantic states and from the central Appalachians to the Carolinas;
thunderstorms from the Dakotas and western portions of the central
and southern Plains to the central and southern Rockies, Utah and
parts of Arizona; and showers over parts of Idaho and the Pacific
Northwest.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 70s or 80s over
much of the nation; in the 60s in the Pacific Northwest and the
northern Rockies, and from the eastern Great Lakes to Pennsylvania,
northern West Virginia and the northern Atlantic Coast; and the 90s
in the desert Southwest and from the central Gulf Coast to parts of
the central and southern Plains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 27
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 79 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   The U.S. dollar edged higher in light European
trading early today, with traders predicting restrained activity a
day after the dollar's sharp gains. Gold prices fell.
   While a sharply improved U.S. trade performance in March boosted
the dollar on Tuesday, dealers predicted the dollar was unlikely to
gain much more ground and said its downward trend had not been
reversed.
   ``If you calculate an average of the last two U.S. (trade)
deficits, you get $11.75 billion,'' said a senior trader in Milan,
Italy. ``That's still a nasty figure.''
   The dollar surged Tuesday after the U.S. Commerce Department
said the nation's trade deficit dropped to $9.7 billion from $13.8
billion in February.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose to a closing 125.53 Japanese yen from 124.82 yen at
Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it dipped to 125.50 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8586 from $1.8630 late
Tuesday. The pound dropped 3 cents on Tuesday after the Bank of
England signaled a cut of half a percentage point in the commercial
banks' base lending rate to 7.5 percent to force down the surging
currency.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   --1.7053 West German marks, up from 1.7045
   --1.4215 Swiss francs, up from 1.4190
   --5.7717 French francs, up from 5.7710
   --1.9093 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9060
   --1,265.75 Italian lire, up from 1,264.00
   --1.2373 Canadian dollart, up from 1.2358
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $453 a troy ounce, down
from $453.50 bid late Tuesday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $452.70.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $453, down from $455 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $454.54
from $454.67 bid at Tuesday's close.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $6.55 a troy ounce, down
from $6.59 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Australian Prime Minister Blames Libya For Riots In Vanuatu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke today blamed
Libya for a riot in Vanuatu that left one person dead and nine
injured in the capital of that tiny South Pacific island nation.
   A New Zealand military aircraft that took riot gear to Vanuatu
returned home today with more than 25 New Zealanders aboard. The
government of Prime Minister David Lange said it would keep
monitoring the situation in Vanuatu.
   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,'' said
Hawke, following reports in the Australian media that
Libyan-trained activists were involved in Monday's riots in the
capital of Port Vila.
   Police said 30 people were arrested after a march by 2,000
villagers in Port Vila became a riot, with protesters looting shops
and smashing store windows.
   Australia also airlifted supplies of riot control gear at the
request of the Vanuatu government, headed by Prime Minister Walter
Lini, who also is an Anglican priest.
   ``Lini is the democratically elected head of a government of a
friendly country ... and Australia can't stand idly by if there are
attempts to undermine by non-democratic process that government,''
Hawke told reporters.
   He presented no evidence to back up his charge against Libya.
   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, was
administered jointly by Britain and France from 1906 until 1980,
when it achieved independence. The island group is 1,200 miles
northeast of the Australian city of Brisbane and has a population
of 130,000.
   Vanuatu sent shockwaves through the generally pro-Western South
Pacific when it decided in 1986 to establish diplomatic relations
with Libya and the Soviet Union.
   Villagers from three tribes decided to march on Lini's office
following last week's closure of the Vila Urban Land Corp. The
government agency administered leases for land on which Port Vila,
a town of 15,000 people, is built and which the tribes say belong
to them by tradition.
   The official Radio Vanuatu said today that life was slowly
``trickling back'' despite injuries and extensive damage to shops
and offices. It said Lini requested civil servants to return to
work and help repair the damage.

   About 900 residents of homeless shelters,
nursing homes and centers for the mentally ill and handicapped
attended a Broadway spectacular featuring songs from a show close
to their hearts, ``Les Miserables.''
   One of the stars of that show, Randy Graff, sang her big number,
``I Dreamed a Dream.'' The theme of the musical is the triumph of
people regarded as society's outcasts.
   ``It kind of gives you a view of what everyone else considers
reality,'' said Mignon Bowe, who said she became homeless after she
fractured an ankle and lost her job.
   Seventeen singing stars, including cast members from other hit
shows like ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' belted out their hits
Tuesday at a Manhattan auditorium.
   ``This is the first time I've ever been to a place like this,''
said 77-year-old Martha Sicilia, who lives in Cliffside Nursing

   ``This is doing what normal people do,'' said Susan Nayowith, a
social worker at a shelter run by the Lenox Hill Neighborhood
Association. ``Most of all, it helps their self-esteem.''
   Also performing were two-time Tony award-winner Dorothy Loudon
and cabaret singer Julie Wilson.
   The event was organized by Hospital Associates Inc., a
non-profit group that stages about 3,500 cultural programs annually
throughout the city.

<TEXT>
   Mexicans continue to head north in search
of work, apparently hoping U.S. employers will ignore a new law
banning them from hiring illegal aliens, authorities say.
   ``I think we're going to show them we're serious about enforcing
employer sanctions,'' Border Patrol agent Jerry Hicks said Tuesday
after authorities arrested 42 people stowed aboard a freight train.
   One of those arrested, Tomas Vega of San Luis Potosi, Mexico,
said he got on the northbound railroad grain car without knowing
what city he would reach.
   ``I came to find work wherever it (the train) stops,'' the
21-year-old undocumented alien said, adding he could not find a job
in Mexico.
   Vega and about 16 others, including a man carrying a crying
3-year-old boy, appeared stunned Tuesday as they climbed down a
ladder from the grain car. Their trip was cut short 30 miles north
of the Rio Grande.
   The 42 aliens found scattered along the Houston-bound train are
among the thousands of people officials say are continuing to flock
to this country illegally every week.
   Employer sanctions under the Immigration Reform and Control Act
of 1986 go into full effect June 1.
   Hicks, the deputy chief patrol agent with the Border Patrol's
McAllen Sector, said the numbers have been increasing lately, and
agents who stopped the train Tuesday had expected to find even more
aliens in the train's 113 cars.
   Immigration officials say lack of employment in Mexico is
prompting the aliens to take their chances on whether employers
will flout the new law.
   A recent five-day sweep of trains netted more than 100 aliens
per day, officials said, including a group suffering from
dehydration in a sealed boxcar.
   ``The situation in Mexico is terrible, and people are caught in
a situation where their country has nothing to offer them,'' said
Telma Longoria, director of Catholic Social Services for the
church's Brownsville Diocese.
   She said the diocese is seeing more Central Americans than ever
at its Casa Oscar Romero shelter east of Brownsville, which
averages 150-200 aliens at any time.
   With the weather warming up, immigration officials said they are
checking the trains more often in order to prevent a repeat of the
tragedy in Sierra Blanca last summer, when 18 aliens suffocated in
a sealed boxcar in the west Texas heat.
   On hand to observe Tuesday morning's pre-dawn train operation
were Jim Olech, the Border Patrol chief in Washington, and Henry
Oncken, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Texas.
   The Border Patrol's McAllen sector reported 1,691 apprehensions
of undocumented aliens during the first week of May, most of whom
were not on trains. Last week, the sector reported 1,080
apprehensions, 204 involving people from countries other than
Mexico, said Fred Rangel, a Border Patrol intelligence agent in
McAllen.
   ``We're still catching 500 or 600 a day,'' said Doug Mosier,
with the Border Patrol's El Paso sector that stretches to the New
Mexico-Arizona line.
   He said apprehensions in the sector are about 30 percent below
the rate of 1986, when agents made 312,000 alien arrests, some of
which were multiple apprehensions of the same people.
   ``The new law's had its impact, but still people are willing to
take a chance,'' said Michael O'Barr, Border Patrol agent in the
Laredo sector. ``Unfortunately, we have those employers who are
willing to hire them.''

   One teen-ager pleaded guilty and four others
pleaded innocent to charges they broke into at least 33 vehicles in
what police called a high school burglary ring operation.
   Police said the students, using tools they made in shop class,
sold the stereos, radar detectors and other items they pilfered.
   Authorities contend the boys used tools made in metal shop or
bent coat hangers to break into the vehicles in Peoria. They were
arrested after an anonymous tip to police.
   The stolen items were sold to fellow students and other
residents in Metamora, a community of about 2,500 people 17 miles
northeast of here, police said.
   The five youths remain under house arrest. Since they were
charged late last month, they have been prohibited from leaving
their homes for any reason except to attend school.
   Three other boys charged a week later remain in their parents'
custody while their cases are pending. They are expected to enter
pleas Thursday to one count each of vehicle burglary.
   Assistant Peoria County State's Attorney Kim Nuss said two girls
also took part in one burglary but probably will not be charged
because police can't find the owner of the car they allegedly
burglarized.
   The youth who pleaded guilty Tuesday did so under a plea-bargain
arrangement, Ms. Nuss said. She said the 16-year-old pleaded guilty
to three counts of vehicle burglary, and another three counts were
dropped.
   The four others, ages 15 to 17, pleaded innocent to multiple
counts of vehicle burglary in Peoria Juvenile Court.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
today he believes there is a ``fair chance'' the Soviet Union will
move towards taking a role within the U.S. framework for peace in
the Middle East.
   Peres, a strong backer of the American peace plan, made his
comments after meeting in Washington Tuesday with the Soviet
ambassador to the United States.
   ``I think that there is a fair chance that the Russians will
make some moves in the direction of the United States proposal,''
said Peres, interviewed from Toronto on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``I'm not sure they will be able to reach a conclusion, but even
if they will reach some progress it will be of importance and great
meaning,'' he said.
   Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin expressed ``significant
differences'' in the Soviet position at the meeting, saying the
Kremlin no longer insists on a dominant role for an international
conference in Arab-Israeli peace talks, according to an Israel
source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Peres said today he welcomed the participation of Kremlin leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but insisted the Soviets would have to work
within the American blueprint.
   ``The problem is not his participation, but the nature of his
participation,'' Peres said. ``It depends very much on the the
Russian policy. ... If there will be the slightest attempt to try
to teach us a lesson or to impose a solution, I think all parties
will refuse.''
   Until now, the United States and Israel rejected Soviet demands
that the superpowers be given an active role in Arab-Israeli talks.
The U.S. peace plan envisions the superpowers only as overseers
devoid of any power to impose.
   Earlier, Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told
reporters the Soviets remain ambiguous about their position on the
peace plan. The Soviets have ``made some hints. We will keep
plugging away at them, and the whole notion of the peace process
will be on the ... summit agenda,'' she said.
   The meeting with Dubinin follows contacts Peres held last week
with Soviet officials in Europe. Based on those contacts, Peres
said he expects the Soviet Union will tell President Reagan at the
superpower summit in Moscow later this month that they are backing
a U.S.-sponsored Mideast peace plan.
   ``I think the occasion will really be in the summit meeting to
have the Russians adopt the needs of the Middle East and not the
Middle East submitting to ideas that were born in Moscow,'' Peres
told reporters following a 30-minute meeting with Reagan.
   Peres and Secretary of State George P. Shultz both hope Soviet
backing will draw Jordan and the Palestinians into the stalled
peace process, thereby forcing Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to join too. Shamir has rejected the international auspices
the plan envisions for Arab-Israeli talks.
   In a clear reference to Shamir, the White House said:
   ``Those leaders who are negative, consistently reject new ideas
and fail to exploit realistic opportunities to bring about
negotiations, make progress impossible. In the end they will have
to answer to their own people for the suffering that will
inevitably result.''
   The statement praised Peres, saying he ``is creative and has the
courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise.''
   Shultz, in a prepared statement following three meetings with
Peres, praised his ``commitment and resolve'' toward finding peace
formulas, giving the foreign minister a boost on which he intends
to capitalize when he runs against Shamir in November's general
elections.
   But Peres, asked by reporters whether he viewed the praise as a
political endorsement, said Israel and the United States do not
interfere in each others' politics.
   The White House, asked whether its statement could be construed
as tilting toward Peres in his competition with Shamir for Israel's
leadership, said only: ``Our statement stands on its own.''
   Shultz said he was embarking on another Mideast shuttle mission
June 3 because he believes the U.S. plan is the only workable
alternative to the violence there.
   But he conceded ``the odds against a breakthrough are high.
Pessimism and cynicism run deep.''

<HEAD>Baker Says World Economic Outlook Bright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said
today the world economic outlook was bright but that U.S. trading
partners needed to move faster with economic reforms.
   He said South Korea, Taiwan and other rapidly growing Asian
economies were hurting efforts to correct world trade imbalances by
failing to deregulate their domestic markets and make them more
open to foreign exporters and investors.
   ``Their (trade) surpluses, particularly in the case of Korea and
Taiwan, are impeding the adjustment of global imbalances and adding
to protectionist pressures,'' Baker told trade and finance
ministers from 24 leading industrial nations.
   Citing the Commerce Department's report Tuesday of an
unexpectedly large drop in the U.S. March trade deficit, Baker said
prospects were good for keeping the world economy on an even keel.
   ``While the near-term economic situation looks encouraging, we
need to maintain this momentum in the medium-term,'' he told the
opening session of a two-day ministerial meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   Baker praised Japan, West Germany and Britain for making
economic adjustments that have helped to prevent last October's
stock market crash from pushing the world economy into a recession.
   He added, however, that the European natios need to reduce their
high unemployment and promote faster economic growth, while Japan
should ensure greater foreign access to its financial markets.
   Baker said the administration of President Reagan had
contributed to helping the world economy by cutting its budget
deficit last year, boosting exports and increasing the consumer
savings rate.
   He said the U.S. general budget deficit _ including state and
local governments _ had fallen to a level lower than the average
for the OECD nations as a group.
   European and Japanese officials struck a similarly upbeat tone,
but they stressed that the Reagan administration should do more to
reduce the federal budget gap.
   ``Efforts by the United States to reduce its budget deficit and
by the European countries to attain robust economic growth are
indispensable,'' said Sousuke Uno, the Japanese foreign minister.
   Uno echoed Baker's call for South Korea and other newly
industrialized nations to play a greater role in efforts to
coordinate world economic policies.
   None of the emerging economic powers in Southeast Asia, which
also include Singapore and Hong Kong, was represented at the OECD
ministerial meeting.
   Jacques Delors, chief executive of the European Economic
Community, told the meeting these Asian nations, which he called
``the four Asian tigers,'' must be encouraged to ``join the club''
of rich nations seeking to coordinate policies.
   Delors also said that while the American economy remained
buoyant, U.S. consumer demand ``at some stage'' will slow down,
presenting a challenge to Europe to pick up the slack in economic
growth.
   The OECD meeting was expected to focus also on efforts to reduce
government subsidies to farmers and to cut down on the accumulation
of farm product surpluses.
   Baker said the best way to coordinate reforms in agriculture was
through the global trade liberalization talks, known as the Uruguay
Round, now getting under way in Geneva.
   ``All countries, however, are responsible for the ultimate
success of the round, not simply the industrial nations,'' he said.

   The Guatemala office of the official Tass news
agency was gutted by two bomb blasts, but the Soviet correspondent
assigned there was unhurt, Tass reported today.
   The news agency said the explosions occurred Tuesday night, and
that a car also was destroyed by the blasts.
   ``The Tass bureau had earlier received a threatening letter from
the ultra-right terrorist organization Mano Blanca (White Hand),''
Tass said.
   Correspondent Alexander Trushin and his wife were not injured,
the news agency said, but did not make clear whether they were on
the scene at the time of the explosions.
   Tass gave no other details.
   Violent attacks on Soviets and their facilities were seldom
reported by the state-run media in the past, but the current
``glasnost'' campaign, which encourages openness, has resulted in
quicker acknowledgement of some such incidents.

   The city will begin random drug testing for its
5,000 police officers next week, Mayor Coleman Young says.
   The mayor said Tuesday about 100 officers could be tested a day,
and the testing would begin in the department's narcotics
department.
   ``It will be fair. It will be thorough. But it will be given,''
Young said.
   If a police officer fails the urinalysis, there will be up to
three more tests before any disciplinary action is taken.
   Drug tests are performed only on police recruits and officers
transferring to the narcotics division, winning a promotion or
suspected of drug abuse.
   Police union officials withheld immediate comment on the
program. The Detroit Police Officers Association and the
Lieutenants and Sergeants Association have filed lawsuits to block
drug testing.

   A former singer in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
Chorus has pleaded guilty to charges he stole $47,000 from the
chorus director, a choral foundation and a fellowship fund.
   Christopher Graves, a tenor in the chorus since 1974, entered a
guilty plea to theft and forgery charges Tuesday and was ordered to
pay full restitution and to perform 400 hours of community service.
   Prosecutors say Graves, 40, was an administrative assistant of
the American Choral Foundation, headed by chorus director Margaret
Hillis, when the thefts occurred. He was also administrative
assistant of the Hillis Fellowship Fund, which helps pay for choral
members' voice lessons.
   He was accused of illegally diverting money from the fellowship
fund, the foundation and Hillis's personal account between August
1984 and November 1986, when Hillis discovered funds missing.

   A city transit bus veered off the road and
smashed into a utility pole and a chain-link fence, killing a
teen-age boy and injuring 23 other passengers, authorities said.
   City and transit authority police today were trying to determine
the accuracy of witness accounts that a car caused the crash
Tuesday night by swerving into the path of the bus, then speeding
away.
   The front of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
bus was heavily damaged. Part of the broken utility pole rested on
a nearby car that was demolished in the accident near downtown.
   City police were questioning the driver of the demolished car,
who appeared to be uninjured. It was unclear whether that car
played a part in the accident, authorities said.
   The bus driver was admitted in fair condition with a broken leg,
said Maria Tayek, spokeswoman for St. Vincent Charity Hospital and
Health Center.
   In all, five people were admitted to area hospitals, none in
serious condition, and 18 were treated and released. Officials did
not know how many passengers were on the bus.
   The Cuyahoga County coroner's office identified the dead boy as
Bernard Murry of Cleveland. The 13-year-old was dead on arrival at
St. Vincent Hospital, said Dr. Carla Streep O'Day, director of
emergency services. She said it appeared that a post from a metal
fence which the bus hit pierced his side.
   Passenger Robert Carter said he saw a dark-colored station wagon
near the bus.
   ``I think I saw someone get out of that car and run away. Then
it was gone,'' he said.
   Sgt. Lou Narducci of the transit police said witness accounts
varied, leaving police unable to determine the cause of the
accident.

<HEAD>Former Labor Secretary Donovan Says Meese Should Remain in Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan said
today that embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III should remain
in office to ensure that the constitutional right of innocence
until proven guilty is not further weakened.
   ``If the leading law enforcement officer of this country, Ed
Meese, is drummed from that office and run out of that town
(Washington) and presumption of innocence is further eroded, that's
a danger to the people,'' Donovan said in an interview from New
York on the CBS ``This Morning'' program.
   Donovan, the first sitting Cabinet member to be indicted, was
found innocent in May 1987 of larceny and fraud charges that forced
him from office in 1985.
   Criminal investigations of Meese have led to unrest and
resignations at the Justice Department.
   President Reagan, who Donovan said stood by him during his legal
problems, on Tuesday reaffirmed his faith in Meese, comparing the
attorney general's situation to that of Donovan.
   The former labor secretary noted the similarities between
himself and Meese.
   ``Those who believed in me, just as those who believe in Ed
Meese, know us to be the honorable people that we are, but there's
a certain segment that you can never convince,'' he said.
   Donovan said Reagan is a ``true friend (who) doesn't believe in
shooting his wounded like many others do in that city of
Washington.''

   A fire today gutted a Soviet passenger liner
carrying Communist Youth League members on a visit to Japan,
killing 11 people as they slept and injuring dozens of others,
officials said.
   The 4,870-ton Priamurye was docked in Osaka and many of the
passengers, all believed to be Soviet citizens, were asleep when
the fire was discovered shortly before 2 a.m. The ship carried 295
passengers and 129 crew.
   Japanese authorities said they began investigating the cause of
the blaze but the Soviets were refusing to cooperate.
   ``They think it's not that important to check what happened, and
they even think it's strange that we want to investigate,'' said
Yoshihide Yasuda, spokesman of the Osaka Prefectural Police.
   In Moscow, the Tass news agency reported 11 people were killed
and 26 were injured, some critically. It gave few details, except
to say all the casualties were Soviets.
   Yasuda also said 11 people were killed, but he gave a figure of
35 injured, with 15 hospitalized for smoke inhalation. Police said
all of the dead were passengers.
   Passengers who fled the ship were taken to a junior high school
gymnasium about a half-mile from the harbor. Some lined up at five
hastily installed telephones to call their families.
   ``Mama, I am safe, the ship burned,'' one young woman was
overheard saying. ``Oh, wasn't it reported yet in the Soviet
Union?''
   ``I was in a third-class cabin when the smoke came in,'' an
unidentified male passenger said in a televised interview with the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. ``I narrowly escaped without taking any of
my belongings.''
   Another male passenger, asked whether he had heard an alarm
bell, replied, ``I was not yet asleep (when the fire broke out),
but I could not hear it.''
   Firefighters extinguished the fire 18 hours after it started,
Yasuda said. The 406-foot ship lay listing and blackened in the
Osaka port.
   The Soviets were arranging for a ship to come to Osaka on Friday
to take away the survivors, Yasuda said.
   The Priamurye's captain, Aleksandr Yerastov, 37, was not on
board when police and fire officials began their investigation,
Yasuda said.
   He said police had been unable to question Yerastov, his crew
and passengers because Soviet consular officials refused to allow
it.
   Police want to question 15 security guards among the crew, but
would not be able to stop them from leaving Japan if they wished to
go, he said.
   In 1982, police could not complete an investigation into a
non-fatal fire aboard a Soviet ship in Yokohama, and the case was
closed without a determination of its cause, he noted.
   The Kyodo News Service said police were investigating careless
smoking and an engine-room problem as possible causes of today's
fire, which sent smoke billowing through the vessel and over this
western Japanese harbor.
   Yasuda refused to comment on possible causes.
   Police said eight of the dead were found on the lowest of three
passenger decks, where the fire was discovered in an area above the
engine room.
   According to a tentative list issued by the Maritime Safety
Agency, the 11 dead _ seven men and four women _ were between the
ages of 22 and 35 and came from several Soviet cities.
   The Priamurye, owned by the Far East Shipping Co. of the eastern
Soviet port of Vladivostok, arrived in Osaka on Tuesday.
   It left Vladivostok May 7 and stopped in Otaru on Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido and in Tokyo. It was to have sailed for
Hiroshima on Thursday.
   The fire was the third disaster to hit Soviet passenger ships in
just over two years. On Aug. 31, 1986, the Admiral Nakhimov
collided in the Black Sea with the freighter Pyotr Vasyev and 398
lives were lost.
   On Feb. 16, 1986, the Soviet cruise liner Mikhail Lermonov sank
after hitting a submerged reef off New Zealand. The single casualty
was a Soviet crew member.

<HEAD>Paris To Begin Re-Establishing Relations with Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Michel Rocard said today that France will
keep its word after three French hostages in Lebanon were released
and will re-establish diplomatic relations with Iran.
   Rocard told Foreign Minister Roland Dumas to begin the process.
   The two countries broke diplomatic ties last summer. The
hostages, held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems since 1985, were freed
May 4.
   Then-Premier Jacques Chirac said on welcoming the hostages that
Iran had intervened to obtain their release and that diplomatic
relations were now possible.
   ``The foreign minister has, by my proposal and the decision of
the president, received today instructions to re-establish
diplomatic relations with the (Islamic) Republic of Iran,'' Rocard
told reporters after a Cabinet meeting.
   Iran has said it has influence over Lebanese groups holding
Western hostages.
   Chirac, a conservative, resigned after his defeat in the May 8
presidential elections. President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist,
won a second seven-year term and appointed Rocard, also Socialist,
premier.
   Rocard said his government knew of no written records of any
agreement resulting from negotiations with Iran. But he said, ``Of
that which is known with quasi-certitude, France will keep its
word.''
   ``My government and the president do not intend to pass judgment
on the conditions under which these negotiations took place,''
Rocard said. ``France gave its word. It will be kept ... for that
which is known.''
   Chirac's statement about re-establishing diplomatic ties has
been the only public reference to what was exchanged in return for
the hostages. The French press has speculated on commercial
considerations and France's repayment of a $1 billion debt for the
nuclear concern, Eurodif.
   Rocard said the return to normal relations would create a better
climate for commercial negotiations and the Eurodif debt.
   The hostages were journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats
Marcel Fontaine and Marcel Carton.
   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations July 17 after an
Iranian Embassy employee refused to turn himself in for questioning
in connection with September 1986 bombings in Paris.
   The employee, translator Wahid Gordji, was allowed to leave
France two days after the return of two other French hostages in
November.
   A total of 10 French hostages were freed from Lebanon during the
two years that Chirac's government was in power. One French captive
died while being held in Lebanon.
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are still missing
and believed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Before he died this year, the
long-time head of the nation's Jewish community apparently
embezzled millions of dollars in government funds earmarked for
Holocaust survivors, his successor said.
   A family lawyer said today that he believed Werner Nachmann, the
former president of the Jewish Council of West Germany, stole the
money to bankroll his troubled business. The lawyer said Nachmann's
heirs have filed for bankruptcy.
   ``I am shocked, horrified and furious that such a thing could be
even possible,'' Heinz Galinski, Nachmann's successor as council
president, said Tuesday.
   Hessicher Rundfunk radio in Frankfurt reported that the council
believes Nachmann, who died in January, embezzled about $19 million
in Holocaust reparations from 1980 to 1987.
   Galinski confirmed that an investigation had been launched and
said Nachmann was suspected of having stolen more than $6 million
in interest accumulated from Holocaust survivor funds.
   He called the radio's figure ``pure speculation.''
   Lawyer Peter Paepcke, who said he had worked for Nachmann for a
decade, claimed he discovered the irregularities and estimated
Nachmann had embezzled as much as $15.6 million.
   ``I'm afraid that what has been said by the Jewish Council is by
and large correct,'' he said by telephone from Karlsruhe, where
Nachmann lived and owned a textile and raw materials wholesale
business.
   Nachmann, president of the council since 1965 until his death at
age 62 of a heart attack, was in charge of disbursing the funds to
Holocaust survivors around the world and had unlimited access to
them, the radio report said.
   About $236 million was appropriated by the government in 1980
for Holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations
claims. The funds were in addition to $47 billion already paid by
West Germany to Holocaust survivors or victims' families.
   The radio report said Nachmann was suspected of taking interest
accumulated from the funds and transferring it to ``among others,
his own company accounts.''
   ``Learning of this surprised and dismayed the council's
directorate, which immediately informed government leaders,''
Galinski said in a telephone interview from his Berlin office.
   ``This has presented me with the most serious problem I have
ever faced in my 40 years of working for the Jewish community,'' he
added.
   Galinski said the Jewish Council ``has contracted with financial
experts to look into the accusations'' and the investigation is
expected to take two to three weeks.
   ``I'm afraid he was getting too overworked and used the money to
keep the company going. He was also under great stress in his job
as head of the Jewish community, and the whole thing just overtook
him,'' Paepcke said of Nachmann, whose company employed 26 people.
   He said he had recently filed for bankruptcy for the family
company and expected the case to be heard in the next week or two.
   Galinski said the council had asked a civil court in Karlsruhe
to freeze money from Nachmann's estate pending an investigation
into the allegations.
   A court spokesman, Alfred Mueller, told the AP that no action
has yet been taken on the council's application.
   Nachmann had been active in trying to help heal wounds in West
Germany left by the Holocaust, in which about 6 million Jews were
killed during Nazi rule.
   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. He
returned to Karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward
re-establishing Jewish communities in the country.
   About 525,000 Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in
1933. West Germany has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.

   Actor Peter O'Toole failed to comply with
a court order to return his 5-year-old son to the boy's mother, but
his lawyer said he believes his client will do so soon.
   O'Toole was ordered last week by Superior Court Judge Alexander
D. Lehrer here to bring his son, Lorcan, back from England by
Tuesday or face a fine and possible arrest.
   Raoul Felder, lawyer for the boy's mother, Karen Sommerville
O'Toole, said he would seek O'Toole's arrest ``in a couple of
days.''
   Jeffrey P. Weinstein, O'Toole's New Jersey lawyer, said he
believes the actor will comply, but would not say when and where.
   O'Toole and Ms. O'Toole met about six years ago, but never
married. After the child was born, the mother began using O'Toole's
last name. A short time later, the couple split and have been
embroiled in a bitter custody dispute for more than a year.

<TEXT>
   The ``Civil Rights Rap,'' a six-minute rap and
video excursion into the civil rights movement, makes the history
lesson a whole new song and dance.
   The video, starring 30 high school students from Massachusetts
and aimed at a young audience, covers some of the major events of
the civil rights movement, setting to rap prose the stories of the
Montgomery bus boycott, the Supreme Court decision which ended
school segregation and the 1960s sit-ins.
   The video, to be shown at the 12th Atlanta Film & Video
Festival, which opens tonight, begins with the rappers from
Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School moonwalking to a driving beat
and offering historical raps such as this verse about the 1956 bus
boycott in Montgomery, Ala., which propelled the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. to national prominence:
   ``This short rap tells of Rosa Parks,
   ``Who caused some friction, set off some sparks.
   ``Rosa wasn't gonna moan, she wasn't gonna fuss.
   ``She just sat down at the front of the bus.
   ``Cops they came and threw her off the line.
   ``Rosa was told that she had to pay a fine.
   ``Blacks all said, `We refuse to ride.'
   ``They had their dignity, they had their pride.
   ``It took a while but after a time,
   ``Blacks up front was no longer a crime.''
   The ``Civil Rights Rap'' is the product of Rapping Up History, a
non-profit project devoted to developing innovative educational
material to make history more attractive to a new generation.
   The video shows the young actors portraying the events in the
song, and includes shots of the rappers performing and documentary
footage from the 1963 March on Washington. It ends with King's ``I
Have A Dream'' speech.
   History teacher Thom Thacker conceived te idea out of his desire
to involve students in learning, said Richard DeLaura, a friend of
Thacker who put the teacher's words to music and produced the song.
   The students, including six rappers who call themselves the Go
Ill Crew, recorded audiocassettes of the song and sold them to
raise money to produce the video.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian mediator seeking to end 13
days of fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias said today
the problem of foreign hostages in Lebanon would be solved if the
combat stopped.
   Ali Mohammed Besharati, Iran's acting foreign minister, told
reporters: ``The case of kidnapping (of foreigners) in Lebanon is
part of the crisis which Lebanon is passing through. I believe that
if we could end the state of war currently prevailing, then
definitely the other case would be solved too.''
   He made the statement in response to reporters' questions after
a meeting with Salim Hoss, Lebanon's acting prime minister.
Besharati would not elaborate on the issue of the hostages, most of
whom are believed held by extremists loyal to Iran.
   Most of the 18 hostages, including nine Americans, are believed
held in Beirut's southern slums, where fighting between the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal
has raged since May 6.
   Lebanese security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that during the meeting with Hoss, Besharati sought support
for an Iranian proposal to end the militia battles.
   One source said Besharati proposed a compromise agreement for
partial deployment of the Syrian army in south Beirut to halt the
bloodshed that has killed 243 people and wounded 762.
   The plan under consideration envisages a Syrian deployment in
the northern districts of the southern slums, where Amal still
holds positions after being dislodged from 90 percent of the
16-square-mile enclave, the source said. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the Syrians ``will not deploy'' in the southern sector
of the disputed area, where Hezbollah has its main bases.
   Besharati would not comment on the report. But he said Iran was
seeking the ``formation of a force to preserve security in south
Beirut.''
   Asked if the Syrians would be represented in this force,
Besharati said: ``We and our Syrian brothers would guarantee this
force.
   ``It is neither in Syria's interest to deploy in south Beirut
nor does the whole population want Syria to enter south Beirut,'''
Besharati said.
   Syria has massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks on the southern,
western and northern edges of the zone since the weekend.
   On Tuesday, Besharati told Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's
military intelligence chief in Lebanon, that Iran did not want
Syrian troops deployed in south Beirut. The two met again today.
   ``We are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problem
and stop the bleeding in south Beirut,'' Kenaan said after today's
meeting. ``But it seems that this effort is not leading to a
tangible outcome.''
   He said Syrian troops were prepared to storm the slums, adding:
``The population has requested the deployment of the Syrian forces
to end their ordeal. We cannot but meet the people's pleas.''
   An Amal spokesman said the militia's chief, Nabih Berri, met
Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus on Tuesday and returned to
Beirut after Assad ``assured him that Syrian forces will enter the
suburbs.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, also is Iran's main
Arab ally. But Assad's government has recently been alarmed by
Tehran's efforts through Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest single sect.
   Local news media have reported that the hostages were moved
since the fighting began.
   One report said they were taken to the basement of the Iranian
Embassy, out of the embattled region. The embassy denied that.
   Another report said they were moved from an exposed Hezbollah
barracks to the home of the militia's spokesman on the fringes of
the zone. That could not be verified.

   A fireworks explosion during testing of
movie special effects tore through a chemical supply house,
injuring three people, one critically, officials said.
   No fire was reported after the blast Tuesday afternoon at
TRI-ESS Sciences, said police Lt. Joe Latta.
   One of the employees injured, Leroy Thomas Hage, 23, underwent
surgery for an abdominal cut and today was in serious condition and
improving, said hospital spokeswoman Norka Manning.
   The other, Fernan Fernandez, 29, was in serious condition with
stomach wounds, Ms. Manning said. Tri-ESS owner Ira Katz, who
suffered cuts and a hand injury, was treated at a hospital and
released.
   ``We were testing pyrotechnics _ special effects for a motion
picture,'' Katz said after returning to his business later Tuesday.
   Fire Chief Ken Whittekind said the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
bomb squad determined that the explosion was caused by the mixture
of two, still undetermined, chemicals.
   Damage to the building was estimated at less than $500,
Whittekind said.
   A spokeswoman for Tri-ESS said the company sells chemical
supplies to industry and schools and a smoke-producing product to
the entertainment industry.

   This town of about 250 registered voters
was puzzled when it found itself with four candidates for the job
of tree warden.
   The root of the problem?
   The candidates didn't know anyone else was running.
   This Berkshire Hills town often has trouble getting enough
candidates to fill out its ballot, let alone more than one hopeful
for each office. Tree warden was the only contested office out of
17 on Tuesday's ballot.
   Helene Morandi, the wife of the election winner, John Morandi,
said her husband is retired and decided to run because he thought
no one else would.
   ``I don't know how there got to be so many of us,'' said another
candidate, Louise G. Dellea, a former tree warden who was drafted
because he thought no one was seeking the job.
   A second former tree warden, David Germain, said he also ran
believing there were no other candidates.
   Election runner-up Louise Hardy had simply said: ``If elected,
I'll find out what the job entails.''

<TEXT>
   State education officials ordered a
school district to stop hanging bricks around youngsters' necks to
make them remember to bring supplies to school.
   Four elementary school pupils were required to carry bricks in
their hands or around their necks last month, said James Bogue,
superintendent of the 400-student Central Heights School District
in Nacogdoches County.
   ``I want to tell you it sounds worse than it was,'' Bogue said
Tuesday.
   The practice was ``something short of punishment, a way to
remind students to bring their materials to class,'' he said.
Pupils could carry the brick in their hands, he said, although some
chose to wear it around the neck.
   Bogue said the district schools will no longer use the bricks.
   Spokeswoman Terri Moore said the Texas Education Agency received
a telephone complaint May 9 and told Bogue to discontinue the
practice. No written complaints, which would lead to a formal
investigation, were received.
   Houston firefighter James Barclay said his 13-year-old son, who
lives with a grandmother in Nacogoches, had to wear a brick bearing
the words, ``I forgot my pencil.''
   Bogue said teachers had discipline problems with the boy. ``It's
on the record that he was sent to the principal's office 49
times,'' he said.

   Police today fired tear gas and smoke
bombs to disperse 5,000 supporters of deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos who rallied to protest the government's refusal to allow him
to attend his mother's funeral.
   At least four women suffered injuries from the tear gas during
the confrontation, according to rally leader Salvador Panelo.
   The Marcos supporters staged a rally in central Bonifacio Square
to demand the return of Marcos for the funeral of his mother,
Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4.
   A breakaway group of 2,000 demonstrators later marched toward
the U.S. Embassy and were blocked near Manila City Hall by 50
policemen, reporters at the scene said.
   A police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when
they started throwing stones at the officers, who fought back with
truncheons. Police used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the
marchers.
   Panelo said the police intervention ``only demonstrates the
weakness of this government because it is afraid of the people's
voice.''
   The protesters scattered in various directions but tried to
regroup in Bonifacio Square, where they held the earlier rally.
   Col. Emiliano Templo, deputy chief of the Capital Command,
appealed to the marchers to stay calm. He said he would allow an
overnight vigil by the protesters, but police blocked access to
road leading to the presidential palace.
   Rally leaders want President Corazon Aquino to reconsider her
refusal to allow Marcos to return to the Philippines for his
mother's funeral. Marcos lives in Hawaii, where he fled after the
February 1986 revolt which toppled his 20-year regime.

<HEAD>Willem Drees, Architect Of Dutch Welfare State, Dead At 101</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with details, background</NOTE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willem Drees, the nation's
longest-serving premier and the architect of its comprehensive
postwar welfare system, has died, the government announced today.
He was 101.
   Drees died Saturday at his home in The Hague and was buried in a
private ceremony Tuesday, according to a government statement. News
of his death was withheld at the request of his family, the
statement said.
   The cause of death was not disclosed. Drees had been in
declining health in recent years.
   Drees began in politics as a member of the Social Democratic
Workers' Party, the forerunner of the current opposition Labor
Party, which he helped found after World War II.
   During 10 years as premier, from 1948-1958, the Labor leader
supervised the nation's re-emergence into prosperity from the harsh
five-year Nazi occupation.
   In 1949, he introduced a state pension for all Dutch citizens
over 65, the basis of today's welfare system.
   Despite some trimming by the fiscal austerity administration of
the current right-wing premier, Ruud Lubbers, the welfare system
still provides cradle-to-grave care for Dutch citizens.
   Although Drees is primarily known as the father of the Dutch
welfare state, he coped with the Netherlands' major foreign policy
issue as well.
   It was his government that waged two Dutch colonial wars in the
late 1940s in an attempt to hold onto the Dutch East Indies.
   But is was Drees himself who decided that maintaining a colonial
empire was a lost cause and ultimately handed over sovereignty of
almost all of the colony to the new Republic of Indonesia in 1949.
   Born into a poor Amsterdam family on July 5, 1886, Drees began
his political career as a stenographer in the Dutch parliament.
   He won a seat in The Hague City Council in 1919 and went to
Parliament in 1933 for the Social Democrats.
   Because of his political prominence, Drees spent part of World
War II as a prisoner at Buchenwald concentration camp, but was
released because of a severe stomach ailment. He became active in
the Dutch resistance.
   Drees pulled out of the Labor Party in 1971, claiming the
party's left wing had betrayed Labor's Social Democratic
foundations.
   The issue of whether to deploy NATO cruise missiles on Dutch
soil marked Drees' final public clash with his successors in the
Labor Party.
   Drees, under whose tenure the Netherlands joined both NATO and
the Common Market, sharply criticized the Labor leadership of the
day for its unconditional opposition to deployment.
   Lubbers' government decided in favor of deployment in 1985.
Under last December's U.S.-Soviet agreement to withdraw all
medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe, deployment of the 48
missiles in Dutch soil was called off.

   A bus driver may have mistakenly pressed the
accelerator rather than the brake in an accident that killed a
teen-age passenger and injured 23 others, police said today.
   ``The passengers told us after the impact the bus accelerated,''
Patrolman Emil Cielec said of the accident late Tuesday night. ``We
feel she might have stepped on the accelerator instead of the
brake.''
   Cielec said the crash occurred when a car tried to turn left in
front of the bus. The bus struck the car, then lurched out of
control, striking a tree, a utility pole and a fence before grazing
a building, he said.
   The bus driver, Audrey Simmons, 27, was hospitalized in fair
condition with a broken leg. Cielec said she has been a bus driver
about seven months.
   The crash is still under investigation and no charges have been
filed, Cielec said.
   A 13-year-old boy on the Regional Transit Authority bus was
killed when a pole from the fence pierced the boy's side, according
to Cielec. He identified the boy as Bernard Murry of Cleveland. The
boy was on the bus with his aunt, who was not injured.
   Five people, including the bus driver, were admitted to area
hospitals, but none were seriously injured. Eighteen others were
released after treatment. Officials were unable to say how many
people were on the bus.
   The driver of the car was in the middle of three lanes on a
one-way street when he tried to turn left, Cielec said.
   ``He was trying to make a left turn and was struck by the bus,''
Cielec said. ``He said he never saw the bus.''
   Cielec said the utility pole struck by the bus fell on the
driver's car, but the driver was not injured. He said it did not
appear alcohol was involved, but an alcohol test was conducted.

<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared in the fraud and
conspiracy trial of a man accused of participating in a kickback
scheme with the former top education adviser to Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis.
   A 12-member jury deliberated 3{ days on one count of conspiracy
and one of mail fraud against Michael Freedman. On Tuesday, the
panel said it could not reach a unanimous verdict.
   The key stumbling block appeared to be whether the prosecution
had proved willfulness on Freedman's part in accepting kickback
money. After the jury raised that question Tuesday morning, U.S.
District Judge Douglas Woodlock again charged the jury on legal
issues.
   Woodlock set a new trial July 11. A new jury will be chosen.
   Gerard Indelicato, who became the governor's education adviser
in March 1983, headed the state's adult education program at the
time the alleged scheme got under way.
   He pleaded guilty last month to participating in the alleged
scheme and testified against Freedman. He is to be sentenced July
8. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants declined to say whether
Indelicato would testify in Freedman's new trial.
   Indelicato won a recommendation from prosecutors for a reduced
sentence in exchange for his cooperation in what Gants called an
``ongoing investigation.''
   Indelicato testified that the scheme involved skimming $80,000
from two adult education programs from 1979 to 1983. The money, he
testified, was shared among Freedman, Indelicato, his brother
Joseph and a fourth conspirator, Antonio Perrotta.
   All but Freedman have pleaded guilty.
   Prosecutors agreed to recommend to Woodlock that Indelicato
receive a five-year prison term and pay an $80,000 fine. Woodlock
could exceed that if he chose.
   Indelicato became Dukakis' education adviser two months after
the conspiracy alleged by the government ended. He testified that
while he worked for Dukakis' election bid in 1982, he was receiving
kickbacks of hundreds of dollars per month from the adult education
program.
   ``It was a regular income, if you will, for all of us,''
Indelicato said.
   Indelicato said Freedman accepted his share and was aware of the
source of the money. But he did not depict Freedman as an architect
of the scheme.
   Freedman's attorney, John Burns, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.

   A hotel that's home to 455 homeless families is
charging the city as much as $1,160 a month for 9-by-12-foot
cubicles without bathrooms, according to advocates for the homeless.
   The Martinique Hotel has subdivided existing rooms to obtain at
least 80 of the cubicles, in violation of state regulations,
according to lawyers for the Legal Aid Society.
   A state hearing officer who ordered the city to stop using such
a room last month found that it ``fails to even minimally conform
to the standards set forth in department regulations.''
   The officer noted in his decision that Room 1127 was too small
to accommodate a table and chairs, lacked a private bathroom and
was infested with roaches. A mother and two young children occupied
the room.
   ``The state has a role to perform _ enforcing its regulations _
and it's not doing that,'' said Steven Banks, an attorney with the
society's Homeless Family Rights project.
   Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources
Administration, admitted that the room violates state regulations,
but said the state knows the city is trying to end the practice of
housing families in hotels.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the hotel and refused to
identify herself said there was no one available to speak to the
press. She said the hotel manager would be in ``sometime this
afternoon.''

   Hundreds of Arabs surrounded an Israeli force
in the occupied West Bank today and attacked them with stones and
slingshots, the army said. The troops killed one Palestinian and
wounded at least four others in the clash.
   Hospital officials and witnesses said nine people were wounded
by gunfire when Arab youths battled hundreds of soldiers in
helicopters, army vehicles and bulldozers in two West Bank
villages. Five Palestinians were taken with Ramallah Hospital after
being beaten, witnesses said.
   The army said the clashes occurred during pre-dawn searches in
the villages of Abwein and Aurura about nine miles north of
Ramallah.
   ``An Israeli force reached the villages ... and was surrounded
by hundreds of Arabs, some of whom climbed nearby hills and
attacked the force with a barrage of stones and with slingshots,''
the army statement said.
   The army said a commander fired rubber bullets, tear gas and
live ammunition to extricate the force, killing one and wounding
four.
   Five Arabs were also injured by rubber bullets and tear gas, the
army spokesman said.
   The clashes in the West Bank came on the final day of the
three-day Moslem feast of Id el Fitr. Underground Arab uprising
leaders called for the holiday to be one of ``national mourning''
for the deaths of 191 Palestinians since Dec. 8. Two Israelis also
have been killed in the uprising.
   Witnesses said troops entered the village of Arura about 4 a.m.
and began house-to-house searches.
   About 300 youths gathered outdoors in the village and threw
stones at the soldiers, said a 19-year-old Arura man who spoke to
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Troops rounded up and detained several hundred Arura youths,
said the man, who spoke from a hospital bed.
   About two hours later, troops began moving into the neighboring
village of Abuwein, where they also conducted house-to-house
searches, witnesses said.
   ``They invaded the village, but the kids went into the hills and
threw stones,'' said Mariam Hamad, 50, of Abuwein.
   The Palestinian killed today was identified as Majdi Youssef
Hilal, 16, who was struck with a bullet in the chest, said Dr.
Yasser Obeid, director of Ramallah Hospital.
   Nine others were shot, including a 27-year-old woman who was in
critical condition at east Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital, Obeid
said.
   Obeid initially put the number of wounded at 10.
   Also today, military sources said troops clashed with guerrillas
Tuesday night after the guerrillas were spotted near a hole in the
border fence outside the Kfar Ruppin communal farm, which is on the
Jordan River about 50 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   Within minutes, settlements in the area were on full alert,
flares lit the sky and soldiers opened fire in the direction of the
fence break.
   Two guerrillas fled into Jordan and the third was shot near the
farm's fish ponds after trying to fire his pistol at the soldiers,
a platoon commander at the scene told Israel army radio.
   The wounded guerrilla was treated by army medics and taken to an
army base. Army radio said the guerrillas apparently planned to
attack Kfar Ruppin, which is 330 yards from the border and home to
several hundred Israelis.
   Jordan today denied knowledge of the infiltration attempt. A
spokesman in Amman said the government of King Hussein would
``never allow infiltrators to cross from Jordan into the occupied
Arab territories.''
   On Dec. 24 Israeli troops captured three Palestinian guerrillas
dressed in Israeli army uniforms who crossed from Jordan into
Israel, the second infiltration from Jordan in 10 years.
   Tuesday night's was the 13th infiltration into Israel since Nov.
25.
   The guerrillas taking part belonged to the Palestine Liberation
Front, a PLO faction headed by Mohammed Abbas, who masterminded the
1985 hijacking of the Italian cruiser Achille Lauro.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Amendment Delays Pentagon Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Desk: Top 3 grafs new with Senate trying to untie legislative

<TEXT>
   The Senate tried again today to untie a
legislative knot that has prevented it from passing a Pentagon
budget bill because of an unrelated amendent allowing the death
penalty for some drug dealers.
   ``We're trying to work out some type of agreement, but we don't
have one yet,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
``I don't know when it will be done.''
   Byrd and other senators were seeking a compromise that would
permit approval of the bill, which authorizes Pentagon spending of
$299.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 .
   The fight involves an amendment that would let dealers convicted
of killing someone to be sentenced to death.
   Opponents threatened a filibuster against the proposal after
they threatened to kill it.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., chief author of the amendment, has
refused to remove it from the Pentagon bill unless he receives
assurances from Democratic leaders that it will be returned to the
Senate floor later with the promise of a certain vote.
   ``We've been trying to get a vote on this for years,'' D'Amato
said Tuesday.
   Three anti-drug proposals have already been attached to the
bill, including one that would increase the military's involvement
in the effort to halt illegal drug trafficking.
   ``We've got to catch them first, and then we can take care of
the penalties. This bill, with the changes we've made, would help
us catch them. Let us go ahead,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   In his appeal to D'Amato, Nunn noted D'Amato was also a major
sponsor of the amendment ordering the military to help catch drug
traffickers.
   The Senate voted easy approval Tuesday of a pair of amendents
expressing displeasure with reports that Reagan is negotiating with
Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, but he has
refused to quit. U.S. economic sanctions have thus far been
ineffective in forcing him out and there are reports the
administration is considering dropping the charges in return for
Noriega stepping down.
   The Senate first voted 95-0 approval of an amendment by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., which provides that no U.S. aid be sent to
Panama until Noriega leaves power and until Reagan certifies that
no Soviet or Cuban troops are in the Central American nation.
   Then the Senate passed, 86-10, a resolution offered by Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas that put the Senate on record
as opposing any deal in which U.S. drug-trafficking charges would
be dropped.
   Senate passage will send the measure to a conference committee
to be reconciled with the separate Pentagon budget bill passed a
week ago by the House.
   That bill also includes an anti-drug provision, stiffer than the
Senate proposal, which orders Reagan to have the military
essentially seal off U.S. borders against drug trafficking.
   Other differences between the bills include:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STAR WARS _ The Senate measure proposed $4.6 billion for
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, while the House voted $3.5
billion. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion. The most likely compromise
would grant about $4.1 billion, which would be an increase over the
current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.
   PAY RAISE _ The Senate approved Reagan's request for a 4.3
percent average pay hike for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed
military personnel, while the House voted for a 4 percent increase.
   ARMS CONTROL _ Both bills ban any SDI tests that would violate
the existing, ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty. But the House measure contains two other
restrictions, including a ban on spending for any weapons that
violate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons in
the unratified 1979 SALT II treaty, and a ban on all but the
smallest tests of U.S. nuclear weapons.
   BASE CLOSINGS _ The Senate bill creates a 15-member Pentagon
commission to study the nation's 3,600 military installations and
recommend by Dec. 31 which ones can be closed. No such provision is
part of the House bill, although that chamber will consider the
base-closing idea in a separate bill.
   CENTRAL AMERICA _ The House bill includes a prohibition against
sending any U.S. combat troops to leftist-ruled Nicaragua, a ban
the Senate refused to add.

   A management trainee and his wife were

during a possible robbery at a Domino's Pizza, Police Chief James

   The trainee, Bill Edwards, 27, and his wife, Frances, 29, a

   Matthew Boornoosh, another Domino's employee, and the couple
were each shot in the head in a back room, he said, adding that
none of the victims was bound.
   The Edwards were the parents of a 2-year-old daughter, Tiffany,
who was home with a baby sitter when they were killed.
   ``We're investigating robbery as the probable motive, but we
don't have any conclusive evidence at this time,'' Gabbard said.
Police have no witnesses, he added.
   Police have been unable to interview Boornoosh, 27, who
underwent emergency surgery and was listed in critical condition
early today at Indian River Memorial Hospital.
   An undisclosed amount of money was missing from the cash
register, Gabbard said.
   ``The store was open at the time. There was no signs of forced
entry,'' he said. ``The way they were shot leads us to believe more
than one person was involved.''
   The victims, were discovered about midnight when a customer
drove to the store because his pizza hadn't been delivered.
   ``The lights were out, and he knew something was wrong,''
Gabbard said.

   The Monkey Business, the yacht that
took Gary Hart on a cruise with Donna Rice, was released without
fines or punishment after having been seized under the
controversial new ``zero tolerance'' drug policy.
   The yacht was boarded by the U.S. Coast Guard Saturday near
Bimini, and searchers discovered a marijuana cigarette aboard.
About eight ounces more of pot was found when the boat docked in
Miami Beach, the Coast Guard said.
   However, no one was charged, and the U.S. Customs Service, which
usually takes over such cases, refused jurisdiction over the boat.
   ``After reviewing the case of the Monkey Business, the Customs
Service feels the matter can be handled best by the Coast Guard,''
said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan.
   The Coast Guard, in turn, decided the case did not merit
administrative forfeiture or a fine, and released the yacht Tuesday
to its Turnberry Isle owners, said spokesman Joe Dye.
   The zero tolerance program allows confiscation of any vehicle,
plane or vessel carrying even small amounts of drugs.
   The 82-foot yacht was made famous last year by Hart, then a
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who took a
trip to Bimini with model Rice on the vessel. Hart's liaison with
Rice led to his withdrawal from the 1988 presidential race.
   The Monkey Business, which rents for $2,500 a day, sports a hot
tub and a bar adorned with an Oriental rug. Elizabeth Taylor, Jack
Nicholson, Elton John and other personalities have sailed it.

<TEXT>
   A chemical factory explosion killed three people
but did not involve fuel for a new long-range nuclear missile, as
the Pentagon claimed, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov said in a telephone interview that the
explosion occurred at 7:15 a.m. on May 12 at a chemical factory in
Pavlograd, about 500 miles southwest of Moscow in the Ukraine.
   Three people at the plant were killed and five were hospitalized
with injuries from the explosion, which occurred in a storage area
for industrial explosives, Gerasimov said.
   Soviet media carried no reports about the explosion.
   U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday the explosion shut down the only plant in
the Soviet Union that makes the main rocket motors for the new
SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile.
   The Defense Department said in a statement Tuesday that the
explosion ``destroyed several buildings at a Soviet propellant
plant in Pavlograd.''
   Gerasimov said propellant was not involved in the explosion but
he said he did not know whether the plant produced rocket fuel.
   Pavlograd, with a population of 122,000, is about 30 miles east
of the major industrial city of Dnepropetrovsk. Gerasimov said no
evacuation of the area's residents was ordered after the explosion.
   The Pentagon said of the explosion, ``Apparently, this will
delay Soviet solid-propellant missile programs.''
   But Gerasimov said the explosion did not cause major damage.
``It's not catastrophic,'' he said.
   The SS-24 is a large 10-warhead weapon that can be launched from
either underground silos or rail cars. The Soviets began deploying
it just last year on rail cars. Fewer than a dozen are thought to
have been made operational to date.
   The SS-24 is one of two ICBMs in the Soviet arsenal that are
mobile. The other is the SS-25, which is carried on a truck
launcher. The United States has yet to deploy any mobile long-range
nuclear missiles, although the Reagan administration is pressing
Congress to develop a rail launcher for the MX missile.
   The accident at the Soviet plant occurred just 2{ weeks before
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev open a
summit meeting in Moscow that is expected to focus on prospects for
an arms accord that would reduce the number of long-range missiles
in each nation's arsenal.
   Reagan administration officials contacted by The Associated
Press said it would probably take the Soviets at least six months
to resume production of the missile.
   ``This is their only production line for the SS-24 main rocket
motors,'' said one administration source. ``This is a severe
setback, albeit temporary.
   ``We estimate they could be back in production in six months.
But in the meantime, it's a significant body blow to their ICBM
program.''
   The sources in Washington said they did know what caused the
blast.
   U.S. spy satellites detected the explosion on the night of May
12, one U.S. source said.
   The blast did not involve any nuclear warheads, another source
said, ``but it sure tore that plant up.''
   ``They've got a lot of rebuilding to do,'' the official added.
   The sources said they did not know whether the plant, in
assembling the main rocket motor for the SS-24, was handling the
oxidizer ammonium perchlorate, a chemical manufactured in a Nevada
plant that was ripped apart by explosions earlier this month.
   The plant, owned by the Pacific Engineering & Production Co., is
one of two in the United States that make a critical ingredient for
the solid rocket fuel that powers the space shuttle and various
American military rockets. The Nevada site was flattened May 3 by
tremendous explosions that killed two people and injured 300 others.

<TEXT>
   Protesters called for the overthrow
of President Roh Tae-woo and clashed with police today in
nationwide demonstrations mourning victims of a 1980 uprising.
   Police headquarters in Seoul reported that 43,000 students and
others joined in demonstrations or sit-ins at 106 places across the
nation. The number included 39,000 students demonstrating at 103
colleges, police said.
   In Seoul, fierce clashes erupted after riot police hurling tear
gas grenades broke up a march in the streets near City Hall. Waves
of screaming students charged riot police near Myongdong Cathedral,
blocking streets and hurling rocks, bricks and firebombs.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship which committed the
Kwangju massacre!'' the protesters yelled. ``Drive out the Roh
murder regime!''
   Clashes also broke out in the provincial cities of Sunchon,
Pusan, Chungju and Chongju where students and police fought running
battles in the streets after rallies marking the eighth anniversary
of the Kwangju uprising.
   Police declined to release any figures on injuries or arrests.
   In Kwangju, long lines of mourners, many wearing black ribbons,
filed through Mangwoldong Cemetery as prayers were offered at
altars bearing pictures of people killed in the uprising.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo, punish (former president) Chun Doo-hwan,''
some protesters shouted during the services in the city 165 miles
southwest of Seoul.
   About 10,000 people, mostly students, later marched from the
cemetery to the plaza in front of the downtown provincial
government office.
   No police were in sight along the route, but police inside the
office fired tear gas, scattering the protesters.
   When the protesters regrouped, some throwing empty cans at the
police, one officer used a loudspeaker to apologize for what he
called a mistaken firing of tear gas.
   The rally then proceeded peacefully, swelling at one point to an
estimated 50,000 people, with another 20,000 to 30,000 spectators.
   Protesters called for daily demonstrations for the rest of the
week.
   The Korean news agency Yonhap reported that a student angered
because a campus festival was going ahead on the Kwangju
anniversary set himself on fire in Chonan, about 30 miles south of
Seoul. It said he suffered serious burns.
   Police were on nationwide alert, with about 50,000 riot police
deployed in Seoul and other cities and security around government
offices was stepped up.
   The leaders of the three main opposition parties agreed today to
push for formation of a legislative committee to investigate the
Kwangju uprising. The meeting among Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and
Kim Jong-pil was their first since the combined opposition defeated
Roh's party in National Assembly elections on April 26.
   At the cemetery, relatives of the dead wept at the gravesides
and put up placards denouncing the Roh government and calling for
retribution. Mourning prayers were chanted and incense burned on
the altars.
   ``We must overcome our anguish and sorrow to drive out the
military dictatorship,'' said Chun Ky-ryang, a leader of the
relatives' of those killed in the uprising.
   Roh and Chun were top generals who had just seized power in 1980
when students and citizens took control of Kwangju during protests
in the traditional anti-government stronghold.
   The government says 191 people were killed when troops ended the
uprising, but dissidents claim hundreds died.
   Roh, who took office in February after winning election in
December, has attempted to defuse lingering resentment over Kwangju
by honoring those killed and offering compensation to victims.

dollar and on Wall Street; PICKS UP 7th graf pvs, `Inflation erodes

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seeing the stock and bond markets take a
tumble over reports of the best U.S. trade performance in three
years, investors and traders may be wondering how much more good
news the markets can stand.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the trade deficit
shrank more than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion _ the lowest
monthly deficit since March 1985 _ largely on a boom in exports.
   The news was good for the dollar, which surged against other
major currencies Tuesday. The dollar's long-term decline apparently
has paid off by making U.S. exports more attractive, and currency
dealers widely believe monetary authorities aren't likely to
depress its value further.
   The dollar retreated today, however, slipping to around 125.43
Japanese yen in midmorning trading in New York from 125.75 yen late
Tuesday. The U.S. currency also declined to around 1.7046 West
German marks from 1.7065 marks.
   To traders on Wall Street and in the bond market, the trade news
confirmed their recent fears that growing exports reflected strong
economic growth that could ignite high inflation.
   After a brief rally Tuesday, stock prices slumped. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials, which had risen late Monday on
expectations the trade shortfall would narrow, fell 21.22 points to
close at 1,986.41.
   Bond interest rates jumped after initially receding. The yield
on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped to 9.22
percent from 9.11 percent late Monday.
   Wall Street continued its decline in early trading today. The
Dow average was down 3.15 points at 1,983.26 at 10:30 a.m. EDT.
   Interest rates crept still higher, as the yield on the key
30-year bond edged up to 9.23 percent at around midmorning.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments such as
bonds, and tends to depress bond prices and drive interest rates
higher.
   Stock and bond traders saw the 23 percent jump in exports in
March _ to an all-time high of $28.97 billion _ as another sign
that the U.S. economy may be overheating dangerously.
   The markets fear the surge in output of export goods could
aggravate inflation by tightening factory capacity, putting more
spending money into workers' pockets and driving up wage costs due
to shrinking labor pools. That could move the Federal Reserve to
push interest rates even higher to try to curb growth.
   Many traders are so worried about inflation that ``they'd take
almost any (economic) number at this point and put a negative cast
to it,'' said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist for Wells Fargo
Bank in San Francisco.
   The last big dose of good economic news also knocked the wind
out of the markets, when the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate in April had dropped to a 14-year low.
   Following the employment report, the Fed nudged short-term
interest rates higher, and major U.S. banks responded by raising
their prime lending rates by half a percentage point to 9 percent.
   As a result, the ``good news is bad news'' syndrome that has
gripped the financial markets made even an improved trade
performance cause for alarm.
   Some economists also were quick to punch holes in the March
trade report.
   The trade deficit for March normally shows a seasonal decline of
around $1 billion anyway, and much of the apparent improvement in
the latest report was due to transitory factors, said John Paulus,
chief economist for the investment firm Morgan Stanley & Co.
   Although total imports rose only 3.6 percent, to $38.7 billion,
imports of goods other than oil increased more than 5 percent, he
noted. On the export side, $600 million of the improvement
reflected sales of gold bullion to Taiwan, which has come under
heavy pressure to reduce its large trade surplus with the United
States.

   The last 46 Sikh extremists holed up in
the Golden Temple surrendered today and emerged with their hands
up, ending a 10-day siege of Sikhism's holiest shrine, officials
said.
   Police shot and killed one extremist when he tried to flee
during the surrender, and three others committed suicide by
swallowing cyanide capsules.
   ``All of them have come out. No terrorist is inside the
complex,'' said Punjab state police commander K.P.S. Gill.
   Sarabjeet Singh, administrator of the Amritsar district, said,
``The temple is in control of the security forces.''
   At least 37 people, mostly Sikh militants, were killed during
the siege of the 400-year-old Golden Temple, the spiritual and
military stronghold of Sikhs waging a campaign of violence for a
separate Sikh nation in Punjab state.
   The figure does not include the three suicides today and another
militant who swallowed cyanide when 146 other Sikhs surrendered
Sunday.
   Police searched the surrendering militants, including one woman,
and removed and unwound the turbans worn by devout male Sikhs, who
do not cut their hair and coil it in a knot under the headgear.
   Commandos surrounded the extremists, who were given water and
snacks and ordered to sit on the ground in a tin shed near the
temple complex.
   Earlier in the day, police had said about 60 extremists remained
in the temple complex, but that figure was only an estimate.
   Since Sunday, police, commandos and paramilitary troops had kept
up pressure on the complex with burst of machine-gun fire,
incendiary bullets and smoke bombs.
   The government forces had rooftop bunkers on most buildings
overlooking the complex. Commandos had moved inside the walls and
occupied a dining hall and two brick towers that had been used as
lookout posts by the militants.
   The surrender followed escalating attacks by Sikh militants
elsewhere in Punjab. In the past 24 hours, Sikh radicals killed at
least 38 people, including 31 migrant Hindu workers late Tuesday
night, in revenge for the siege.
   About 2,800 policemen, commandos and paramilitary troops
surrounded the Golden Temple complex May 9 after Sikh extremists
fired at police officers who were making an inspection just outside
the walls.
   The Indian army raided the Golden Temple in June 1984 to drive
out militants, and some 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, were
killed. Five months later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards to avenge the attack on the
temple.
   Sikhism was formed 500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism
and Islam. Sikhs form less than 2 percent of India's 800 million
people, but they are a majority in Punjab. Sikhs say they are
discriminated against by the Hindus, who account for 82 percent of
the population.
   In the Tuesday night attack, about 15 Sikh extremists attacked
Hindu canal workers at a camp near Kharar village, 12 miles from
the state capital of Chandigarh, police said.
   Thirty-one workers were killed and 20 injured. Survivors said
the gunmen repeatedly shouted that they were taking revenge for the
Golden Temple siege.
   Police Superintendent Chander Shekhar said a note found at the
scene claimed responsibility for the Khalistan Commando Force, one
of a dozen Sikh separatist groups. The note said the attack was in
retaliation for the siege, Shekhar reported.
   Seven other slayings Tuesday raised to 97 the number of people
killed by Sihk extremists in Punjab in the past three days.
   About 1,060 people have been slain by Sikh militants in Punjab
this year. In all of 1987, the radicals killed 1,030 people.

   Three Arab suspects confessed to attacks
that killed seven people and declared they were waging a terror
campaign against Britain and the United States, a senior police
officer said today.
   The Arabs, who carry Lebanese passports, told investigators they
trained in an Arab country for the Sunday night attacks on a hotel
and a club, said Police Inspector Gen. Ibrahim Ahmed Abdel-Karim.
   Abdel-Karim, whose remarks were carried by the official Sudan
News Agency, did not identify the suspects or the country.
   Abdel-Karim said the three told police that one man set off
explosions at the Acropol Hotel and the other two sprayed the
nearby Sudan Club with automatic weapons.
   Five Britons, including a family of four, and two Sudanese died
at the Acropol. Twenty-one people were injured in the hotel and the
club, including three Americans and an unspecified number of
French, British, Dutch and Swedes.
   Abdel-Karim said the suspects told interrogators that the
attacks were directed ``against American and British interests.''
   The hotel is a favorite haunt of foreign relief workers and
journalists, and the club is frequented by British and other
Commonwealth nationals.
   Abdel-Karim said the suspects told police they acted on their
own and had no accomplices. He said police believe others were
involved, but he did not say where they are.
   ``The group is bigger than (the three in custody) and it has
international and regional branches,'' Abdel-Karim said.
   Information Minister Abdullah Mohammed Ahmed told reporters the
three got visas to enter Sudan from the embassy in Kuwait and came
to Khartoum a few months ago after a stop in West Germany. He said
they posed as businessmen.
   Ahmed said preliminary investigations showed the attackers
planned to set off the Acropol explosions halfway through
dinnertime, when the restaurant would be full.
   They planned a simultaneous bombing at the Sudan Club, where a
party was supposed to be held, ``but for some reason the bomb at
the hotel exploded before its scheduled time,'' he said.
   He said the premature explosion ``alerted people at the Sudan
Club and made possible a partial evacuation ... before the
attackers arrived there, threw grenades and opened fire with
submachine guns.''
   ``If it were not for the premature explosion at the hotel, a
great massacre would have taken place,'' he said.
   Ahmed said police discovered the three suspects had worn three
layers of clothing for the attacks: the traditional flowing
Sudanese robe, topped by a safari suit and then a sports training
suit.
   He said two attackers were seen throwing away their top garments
and two submachine guns near the attack site. Police dogs were used
to sniff the discarded clothes and track down the two men, he
added. The third suspect was apprehended later as he entered a
rented apartment where the attackers lived, the minister said.
   A government source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
attackers claimed foreign relief workers staying at the Acropol
were using their humanitarian work as a cover for espionage.
   The source also said the three men intended to carry out other
terrorist attacks in the capital but refused to give details.

   The White House and Senate leaders pressed the
chamber today to approve the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms treaty within
a week so President Reagan can take it with him for his Moscow
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Democratic-controlled Senate returned to the treaty a day
after it finally opened debate on the pact signed last Dec. 8 by
Reagan and Gorbachev.
   Reagan leaves next Wednesday for the summit, which begins May 29.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker told reporters it would
be ``a major plus'' if the Senate ratifies the treaty before the
summit.
   Baker, former Senate majority leader, said he believes ``the
odds are better than even'' the deadline will be met. ``That's up
to the Senate and I hope my former colleagues in the Senate move
forward with speed, because to be able to take the ratification
documents to Moscow would be a major plus.''
   ``Not taking them would be a disappointment _ it would not be a
disaster _ but it would be a disappointment and might have some
effect on the Soviets' willingness to go forward to the next
treaty,'' said Baker.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters,
``this treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves if
we deal only with those serious, legitimate amendments that ought
to be dealt with on this issue.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said, ``I do hope the
president will have the treaty when he goes to Moscow.''
   But Dole and Byrd both said they expect a number of amendments
to be offered later and they cautioned that the pact could be
delayed.
   As debate opened Tuesday, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee, urged his colleagues to
``proceed expeditiously to approve the treaty in ample time'' for
the summit.
   Both Dole and Byrd have predicted that when the Senate finally
votes, the pact will be ratified by far more than the 67 votes
required.
   Senate floor action had been delayed for more than a week by two
disputes, one over how the United States and the Soviets interpret
the on-site inspection verification provisions and the other
involving whether so-called ``futuristic'' weapons are banned by
the pact. Both nations agree they are.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty requires the
elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300
miles to 3,400 miles.
   There were no surprises Tuesday during opening statements.
   Republican conservatives, including Sens. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina and Steven Symms of Idaho, criticized the pact and said it
could damage the security of Western Europe.
   ``I have a hunch that if Ronald Reagan were running for
president this year instead of being in his last year in office he
would be out on the hustings demanding the Senate reject this
treaty,'' Helms contended.
   But Reagan had a different view. The president told reporters at
the White House, ``I'm both hopeful and confident that after
careful consideration, the Senate will agree that this treaty is a
diplomatic milestone and will give its consent to United States
participation.''
   The treaty vote will be the first time that the Senate has acted
on a U.S.-Soviet arms control pact since it ratified the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The INF pact will also be the first to actually require the
destruction of weapons. Past treaties have simply slowed the rate
of growth of the superpowers' arsenals.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called the pact ``the beginning of
the end of this mindless race to add ever more nuclear weapons.''
   Helms and other critics have readied a series of amendments to
make significant changes in the treaty.
   Helms said one of his amendments would require the withdrawal of
all U.S. military forces from Western Europe if the INF treaty
takes effect. The United States has about 325,000 military
personnel stationed in Europe.
   Helms argued that the U.S. forces would be defenseless if the
U.S.-built Pershing 2 and cruise missiles are removed and he said
Europeans should pay for their own defense.
   Democratic leaders say that amendment is considered unlikely to
be approved and they have pushed for rejection of all but a single
amendment.
   That proposal was adopted by the Foreign Relations Committee,
and Republicans say it will be the subject of a floor fight as they
try to remove it.
   The amendment would require future presidents to adhere to the
current interpretation of the INF pact offered by the Reagan
administration.
   That amendment arose from a separate dispute over Reagan's claim
that his administration can unilaterally change how the United
States views a separate pact, the 1972 ABM treaty. Congressional
Democrats have disagreed with that contention.

   Two grenades exploded early today at the
home of the correspondent for the Soviet news agency Tass after a
threat by a right-wing terrorist squad, the correspondent said.
   Alejandro Trouchine said the blast damaged his vehicle and the
door of the house and broke windows, but no one was injured.
Windows also shattered in neighboring homes, he said.
   Trouchine, who opened the Tass office here in January, has his
office at his home.
   Trouchine said he and his wife Elena were at home when the
blast, heard in a large part of the southern part of the city,
occurred at 2:20 a.m.
   Their 12-year-old son Eugenio left two weeks ago for Moscow, he
said.
   He said that on May 9 he had received in the mail a communique
from ``Mano Blanca,'' Spanish for White Hand, which said in part:
   ``The Mano Blanca rises again in the combative life of
Guatemala, raises its flags of western Christian civilization
against the new Marxist avalanche that keeps company with two
Communist espionage agencies, Tass and Prensa Latina, for whom we
have a surprise at the right oportunity,'' the communique said.
   Prensa Latina is the Cuban government news agency.
   The communique, dated April 14, also threatened representatives
of an exile opposition organization who visited the country a few
days later. Parts of it were published in local newspapers at the
time.
   In a dispatch from Moscow, Tass said the explosion gutted the
Tass office but said it happened Tuesday night. Violent attacks on
Soviets and their facilities were seldom reported by the state-run
media in the past, but the current ``glasnost'' campaign, which
encourages openness, has resulted in quicker acknowledgement of
some such incidents.
   The attack came a week after a failed coup attempt that the
government of President Vinicio Cerezo blamed on civilians, former
military officials and dissident officers.
   Cerezo took office Jan. 14, 1986, as the first civilian
president since 1970. He was the second civilian to take office in
more than 30 years of military and military-dominated rule.
   Mano Blanca was most active from the mid-1960s until about 1980,
claiming responsibility for bombing and assassinations of people it
claimed were communists.

<HEAD>Groups Propose Principles to Improve Cleanup of Nuclear Weapons
Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen environmental, peace and anti-nuclear
groups proposed today a set of principles they said should guide
efforts to improve cleanup of the Energy Department's nuclear
weapons plants.
   They called for, among other things, independent oversight of
safety activites at the department's plants, as provided for in
some of the five different bills on the subject being considered by
Congress.
   The groups did not collectively endorse any of the bills.
``There are bits and pieces of each'' that deserve support, said
Tim Connor of the Hanford Education Action League in Washington
state.
   The groups said they would cooperate in lobbying efforts, but
were not forming any umbrella organization.
   The Energy Department is expected to propose in July a new
reactor to produce tritium, which decays rapidly and must be
renewed in stored weapons from time to time.
   The groups' proposal called for a public demonstration that
additional nuclear weapons materials are needed; independent
licensing of new plants and safety regulation; provisions for
public participation in licensing; compliance with all federal and
state environmental laws; a federal commitment to pay all clenaup
costs; long-term health studies of nearby residents and job
retraining for displaced workers when plants close.
   ``This is not a ban-the-bomb statement,'' said Connor.
   Groups participating were the Environmental Policy Institute;
Greenpeace; American Friends Service Committee; Puget Sound SANE,
Seattle; Palouse Clearwater Hanford Watch, Moscow, Idaho; Ohio
Public Interest Campaign, Cincinnati; Northwest Nuclear Safety
Campaign, Seattle; Snake River Alliance, Ketchum, Idaho; Hanford
Education Action League, Spokane, Wash.; Fernald Residents for
Environmental Safety and Health, Harrison, Ohio; Energy Research
Foundation, Columbia, S.C.; Colorado Peace Network, Denver;
Coalition for Safe Power, Portland, Ore., and Citizens Against
Rocky Flats Contamination, Denver.

   The chief of Navy training has ordered a
thorough review of procedures involving risk after five instructors
were accused of forcing a recruit underwater in a pool and
unintentionally causing his death.
   A preliminary hearing will be held next week to determine
whether the five instructors and the officer-in-charge, Lt. Thomas
A. Torchia, should be court- martialed or whether the charges
should be dropped, a Navy spokesman said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Vice Admiral N.R. Thunman, the chief of Navy
training, has instructed commanders of training programs to review
all their safety procedures, said Lt. Brian Cullin, a Navy
spokesman in Washington.
   Thunman told The New York Times he wanted to know, ``Are we
training too close to the edge, are we too close to the margin?''
   ``The admiral has ordered an in-depth look at all the training
schools,'' added Cullin, noting Thunman's command covers basic
training as well as various technical, aviation and special
operations schools.
   Nonetheless, the air-sea rescue course in which Airman Recruit
Lee Mirecki died would be resumed next month, the Times quoted
Thunman as saying. Since it began in 1983, the course has graduated
1,573 sailors.
   Mirecki of Appleton, Wis., died March 2 after being pulled from
a pool at the Navy Rescue Swimmer School of the Naval Aviation
Schools Command.
   Initially, the Navy said Mirecki died of cardiopulmonary failure
during the program, which trains Navy air crew personnel for search
and rescue missions.
   But Mirecki's fellow students contacted news media and his
family to say he was treated unusually harshly the day he died.
   Instructors forced Mirecki into the pool against his will, held
his head under water and broke his grip on a rack and safety rope
before he died, according to Navy charges.
   The defendants are Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, who was
officer-in-charge, charged with dereliction of duty; Petty Officers
Richard E. Blevins, David J. Smith, Michael W. Combe, Frankie E.
Deaton and John W. Zelenock, who were instructors, were charged
with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery in
Mirecki's death.
   Navy Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio Jr. has been appointed by Rear
Adm. David Morris, chief of naval air training, to preside over the
hearing set for May 25 at Pensacola  ...
   All the defendants are on temporary leave from their duties, and
the rescue swimmer school has been suspended indefinitely, Saunders
said.
   If convicted, Torchia faces a maximum penalty of punitive
dismissal from the Navy and three months confinement. The
instructors face a maximum penalty of dismissal and three years
confinement.
   A Navy official who asked not to be named said today the
service's inspector-general had just completed an independent
assessment of training procedures at various schools and concluded
they were inadequate.
   Although the final report has not been completed, ``the
inspector general found with regard to the rescue swimmer school
that safety procedures either didn't exist or were out of date,''
said the official.
   The inspector general also concluded instructors had not been
taught proper teaching methods or how to handle emergencies, the
source said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, a legislator with the
governing Conservative Party in the House of Commons, died today.
He was 60.
   Williams, who has represented the west London constituency of
Kensington for 20 years, died at Westminster Hospital, the hospital
said.
   His secretary, Primrose Palmer, said Williams died of pneumonia
while undergoing treatment for leukemia. He was hospitalized in
early April, she said.
   Williams' death will force the first special election for the
House of Commons since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher won a third
term last summer.
   He won 47 percent of the Kensington vote in the June 11 general
election, in which the Conservatives won a 102-seat majority in the
650-member House of Commons.
   Williams inherited from his family the title of baronet. He
served as a lieutenant in the Welsh Guards from 1946 to 1948 and
unsuccessfully contested Labor seats in South Wales two times in
the late 1950s and 1960s.
   He was a member of the European Parliament representing
southeast London between 1973 and 1984.
   Williams is survived by his wife, Caroline, one son and two
daughters.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II was serenaded by a
crowd of 1,000 young well-wishers when he got up today, his 68th
birthday and the last day of his four-nation tour to South America.
   ``I still feel young, especially when I'm with young people,''
the pontiff told the singers.
   The young people gathered at 8 a.m. outside the Vatican envoy's
residence, where John Paul spent the night. Following a chorus of
``Happy Birthday,'' the pope came out to greet the crowd.
   John Paul later departed by plane for the Parana River port of
Encarnacion, birthplace of President Alfredo Stroessner, 234 miles
southwest of Asuncion on the border with Argentina.
   The schedule for today, final day of his South American tour,
also included a Mass in Caacupe, site of the national religious
shrine, about 34 miles east of Asuncion. The pontiff returns to the
capital for a youth rally before departing for Rome at the end of
his tour, which began in Uruguay on May 7 and also took him to
Bolivia and Peru.
   At a meeting with prominent citizens Tuesday night that
Paraguay's authoritarian government initially tried to prevent, the
pope told a cheering, chanting crowd of 3,800 that democracy is
impossible without real participation by all citizens.
   Responding to Paraguayans' complaints of political oppression,
the pontiff spoke of human rights and fundamental civil liberties
in this landlocked country that Stroessner, a general, has ruled
for 33 years in what is widely regarded as a dictatorship.
   The crowd interrupted the Roman Catholic leader 18 times with
applause.
   A block of 60 chairs reserved for officials of Stroessner's
rightist government and governing Colorado Party sat empty during
the hour-long gathering in a government-owned sports stadium.
   Last week, the government abruptly canceled John Paul's
scheduled meeting in the stadium with the ``Builders of Society,''
a church-picked collection of cultural, business, education and
political leaders that includes opposition figures.
   It later backed down after the Vatican protested. Such a
government ban would have been unprecedented in this pontiff's 37
foreign tours.
   As the stadium filled in the hours leading up to the pope's
arrival, an hour late, people chanted anti-government slogans and
sang folk songs. Several speakers addressed the exuberant crowd,
denouncing repression.
   ``It is impossible to speak of true liberty, and even less of
democracy, where there is no real participation by all citizens in
making the great decisions that affect the life and future of the
nation,'' he told the crowd.
   A small group sat through the speech wearing mock handcuffs and
gags.
   Among those attending was Domingo Laino, leader of the
center-left Authentic Liberal Radical Party, one of four political
groups the government does not allow to participate in elections.
   Laino drew wild cheers when he was greeted and embraced by local
bishops.
   As the pope departed, the crowd broke into the chant, ``Dear
John Paul, the people are banned.''
   On Monday, Stroessner told the pope that Paraguay enjoys full
democracy and that its citizens flourish under his law-and-order
policies.
   Stroessner, 75, took power in a 1954 coup and last February was
elected to an eighth straight term as head of this nation of 3.8
million in balloting opppositon leaders called rigged.
   On Tuesday, the pope met with about 5,000 native Indians in
Mariscal Estigarribia, 340 miles northwest of Asuncion.
   White ranchers have ``taken away our land, burned our houses and
divided our communities,'' said Rene Ramirez of the Maskoy tribe.
``Cattle are more important than we are.''
   The pontiff on Tuesday also said Mass in Villarrica, a farm
center 100 miles southeast of Asuncion. He denounced the
exploitation of Latin America's peasant farmers, telling 350,000
``campesinos'' not to be resigned to poverty.
   Paraguay's authoritarian government has harshly repressed
attempts by peasant farmers to organize.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 teen-agers rampaged through a
resettlement camp to protest a government decision to draft them
into military service, the defense minister said Wednesday.
   The youths burned down huts at the Kambi Lombilo camp in the
central Zambian city of Ndola on Monday and smashed furniture, said
Gen. Malimba Masheke.
   The teen-agers were forcibly moved from urban areas three weeks
ago under a state-sponsored program to establish resettlement
centers for jobless youth in cities and towns.
   Masheke, who visited the camp Wednesday, told reporters in
Lusaka, the Zambian capital, that the rioters destroyed makeshift
homes they had built themselves when they first arrived.
   Camps were established last month in Lusaka and Ndola to
accommodate 5,000 jobless boys and girls from Zambia's crowded
urban areas.

<HEAD>TV Personality Who Was Falsely Accused of Drug Trafficking Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Enzo Tortora, a popular Italian TV
personality who was convicted of drug trafficking and organized
crime charges but later cleared, died Wednesday of lung cancer. He
was 59.
   Tortora was the host of the weekly TV variety show
``Portobello,'' which regularly attracted an audience of 25 million
after going on the air in 1977.
   He was arrested in March 1983 after a criminal who turned
state's witness accused him of associating with the Camorra, the
Neapolitan version of the Mafia, in cocaine trafficking.
   Tortora was convicted in 1985 and sentenced to 10 years in
prison. The conviction was overturned the next year on appeal and
upheld in 1987 by the nation's highest court after he had been in
and out of jail over a period of 1,186 days.
   Tortora had maintained his innocence. His case raised ethical
questions about the use of suspects-turned-witnesses whose
testimony has led to major breakthroughs in Mafia-type cases.
   The small Italian Radical party took up Tortora's defense and
entered him as a candidate in elections to the European parliament
in June 1984. He won a seat but abandoned it in 1985 to protest his
conviction.
   Tortora, who was divorced, is survived by two daughters.

   Baltimore Sun on the INF treaty:
   Having cleared away obstacles to the INF treaty in negotiations
with the Soviet Union, the Reagan administration now faces even
tougher bargaining with the United States Senate. ...
   The administration deserves to lose this face-off with the
Senate for two key reasons: First, its attempt to reinterpret the
1972 Anit-Ballistic Missile treaty in order to promote the
Strategic Defense Initiative is so obviously contrary to law and
custom that it cannot bear close scrutiny. Second, the Senate's
need to reassert its constitutional treaty powers so obviously
outweighs President Reagan's desire for a pro forma diplomatic
ceremony with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev that the
White House is bound to blink.
   Humiliation of the president is hardly a wise gesture before the
summit. Therefore, American citizens have a right to expect the
executive and legislative branches to work out some face-saving
language to cover an administration retreat on the ABM issue.
   At no point should the Senate withdraw from its insistence that
treaty testimony offered by an incumbent administration is binding
on future administrations.

   The Long Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram on presidential aides'
memoirs:
   Now that Larry Speakes and Don Regan have sullied the
administration with books about their White House experiences, some
argue that such kiss-and-tell revelations should be delayed until a
president has left office.
   Regan's response to that is that Nancy Reagan didn't wait that
long to have him fired.
   His tone is petulant, but Regan has a point.
   And that suggests that this president and future presidents
ought to have a friendly chat with key appointees in the future. It
seems fair enough to ask them to delay any potentially damaging
revelations until the president has left office.
   Presidential appointees _ including Don Regan _ are almost
without exception decent men and women who would honor such a
request unless strong considerations of conscience or national
security were involved. ...
   Friendly agreements for the duration of a president's time in
office ought to allow the chief executive to go about the job
without fear that associates will stab him in the back before it's
done.

   The Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on George Bush:
   George Bush is emerging from the vice presidency as the
quintessential faithful dog who never even barks, let alone bites,
his master.
   Judging from the public comments Bush has made over the past 7{
years, you would think (President) Reagan has never uttered a word
or had a thought that was not 100 percent in keeping with Bush's
own feelings. ...
   However, it's a well-known political fact that personal
popularity does not transfer. Just because Candidate Two might say
he will do everything precisely as his popular predecessor would,
Candidate One's voter strength will never be passed along intact.
...
   The only way for Bush to shed this image is to assert himself.
Instead of depending on the actions of others ... Bush will have to
prove by his actions and words what he is. ...
   We know George Bush is a nice man with good experience in
government. We believe he is a good organizer of administrative
affairs. But after all this time in public office and on the
campaign trail, he has yet to show us what he really stands for.

   Westerly (R.I.) Sun on raising the speed limit from 55 mph to 65
mph:
   To those who think the 65 (mph) law is a killer, Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley must look like a devil's advocate. He says
the traffic death rate has not been worsened.
   This flies in the face of the National Safety Council's ... view
that higher speeds are causing more deaths.
   (Burnley) promises supportive data in a forthcoming report to
Congress. We shall see.
   Meanwhile, he does make one excellent point _ that enforcement
of speed limits is of crucial importance in holding down fatalities.
   But ... there is this House testimony by Judith Stone of the
National Safety Council to think about: ``We have a very strong and
clear indication from across the nation that average speeds have
increased and more people are dying and sustaining more severe
injuries on these roads.''

   The Huntington (W.Va.) Herald-Dispatch on airplane safety:
   The two Aloha Airlines pilots who safely landed a Boeing 737
after a large section of fuselage blew away ... were honored in
ceremonies at the White House ... _ and rightly so. ...
   But while the pilots garner their well-deserved praise, federal
investigators are working behind the scenes to figure out the
bizarre mishap's cause. And their initial findings are far from
reassuring.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has disclosed that Aloha
received warnings months ago that its aging planes needed better
maintenance.
   Obviously, not only Aloha but all the nation's airlines need to
pay closer attention to the FAA's warnings of potential problems.
   And it well may be that airlines _ worried about their
profit-loss statements _ are trying to squeeze too much life out of
their older planes.

   Dallas Times Herald on outlawing plastic weapons:
   The Senate Judiciary Committee took a reasonable, necessary and
courageous stand in unanimously approving legislation that would
ban plastic guns and any other firearms that elude metal detectors
and X-ray machines.
   This nation cannot afford to permit the manufacture or sale of
these kinds of weapons.
   The committee's voice vote clears the ban for action on the
Senate floor. Congress should waste no time in protecting Americans
from lethal guns that could be easily smuggled aboard airlines.
Terrorists do not deserve to have any friends in Washington. ...
   We hope that the willingness of congressional leaders to take a
stand in the case of plastic guns, despite threats of a political
retaliation at the polls, will lead to a candid and courageous
review of a whole series of gun-control regulations.
   There must be a balance between sanity and total surrender.

   Worthington (Minn.) Daily Globe on President Reagan's
endorsement of George Bush:
   That was some endorsement President Reagan gave Vice President
George Bush. ...
   For an opener, the president waited until Pat Robertson
terminated his candidacy and there was no one but Bush remaining in
the Republican race.
   The president didn't devote his remarks primarily to the Bush
candidacy. He talked on other subjects for 15 minutes and then
appended a three-sentence comment on Bush at the end of his address.
   To top it all off, Reagan said ``George Bosh'' in one of the
three references he made to the vice president during the course of
his speech. ...
   It's an expansive endorsement and a glowing tribute in the
context of what the president has said in support of other
candidates _ Jesse Jackson, or Michael Dukakis.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal editorial on Panama's Gen. Noriega:
   Offering to trade U.S. criminal charges for an agreement that
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega would relinquish control of
his government puts U.S. justice up for sale or trade.
   The Reagan administration has been discussing a deal that could
result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges against Noriega
if the general gives up his power by August.
   The administration describes its plan to coax Noriega to step
down as ``diplomatic plea bargaining,'' thus devaluing U.S. justice
and telling criminals that criminal charges can be negotiated away
in the embassy back room.
   Criminal charges should not be political nor negotiable outside
the context of official court proceedings, not even by the White
House.

   It appears to have been a large step backward on the road toward

   New Jersey Herald, Newton, N.J., on new boxing regulations:
   The sport of boxing is safer and its integrity less susceptible,
thanks to a bill signed into law that affords participants
increased medical protection and mandates them and their staffs to
undergo background checks to ensure there are no ties with
organized crime. ...
   The law requires two physicians be present at ringside and all
boxers undergo a physical examination after every bout. In
addition, fighters are required to carry medical insurance
coverage. ...
   Currently only promoters sponsoring bouts in casinos are
checked. The new law requires that all promoters, managers and
trainers submit to annual background checks.
   The reforms are a step in the right direction to ensure boxing
is safer and not tainted by people who might want to control the
outcomes of bouts.

<HEAD>Baker Doesn't Believe Astrology or First Lady Influence Reagan
Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.
said Wednesday he never has seen President Reagan make a policy
decision based on astrology or due to the influence of first lady
Nancy Reagan.
   Baker, in a brief exchange with reporters, took issue with his
predecessor, Donald T. Regan, who claimed in his book ``For the
Record'' that astrological forecasts were used by the first lady to
determine White House events and that she played a key role in
ousting numerous administration officials.
   ``I am with the president every day, most of the day _ and I can
tell you first-hand, I've never seen any decision, certainly no
policy decision, that has ever been affected either by the first
lady's input or by astrology,'' Baker said.
   At a brief news conference on Tuesday the president said he did
not use astrology to ``guide my life,'' but he sidestepped the
question of whether he believed in it or not.
   ``I don't know enough about it to say, is there something to
it,'' the president said.
   Regan's book also painted a picture of an incurious, passive
chief executive manipulated by a strong-willed wife and
media-conscious staff.
   Baker acknowledged that the president does have ``a great
respect for the first lady's judgment _ she has good judgment, she
has good instincts and intuition.''
   But the chief of staff argued that Regan overplayed the
passivity of the president.
   ``Ronald Reagan is president of the United States, and I can
tell you that after a year and a half on this job, he is president,
he knows he's president, he acts like a president, he likes being
president and he's a good president,'' Baker said.
   While not mentioning Regan's name directly, Baker said tell-all
books should not be written. He indirectly criticized the former
chief of staff for breaching a code of confidentiality that should
accompany such high-level positions.
   He added that he doesn't intend to write a book.
   ``I don't think you ought to write those books. I think when you
take a job like this that there's at least an implied commitment
that you're not going to write books like that,'' Baker said,
adding, ``If you're in daily, intimate contact with the president
in a decision-making process, I think there's an obligation to
treat that discreetly and confidentially.''
   Baker was asked to succeed Regan in the aftermath of the
revelations of the Iran-Contra arms and money affair. In his book,
Regan contends Mrs. Reagan took part in the effort to drive him
from the White House and discusses how he resigned in a huff after
he learned in a news report that Baker had been named to the post.

   Sen. Lowell Weicker, traveling to
Connecticut with President Reagan, today labeled Attorney General
Edwin Meese III ``a son of a bitch.''
   Taking advantage of the chance to present his views to the small
pool of reporters who accompany Reagan on the presidential jet,
Weicker said:
   ``I've been battling the son-of-a-bitch ever since he became
attorney general. I don't like him.''
   Weicker's comments came in the context of his answer to
reporters' questions about whether Meese should resign.
   The Connecticut Republican, who long has been at odds with the
administration on a variety of issues, said, ``I want to see the
report of the special prosecutor first.''
   Reagan often invites members of Congress to accompany him on
trips to their states and districts as a matter of presidential
courtesy. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., also traveled on the
presidential aircraft today.
   For his part, Reagan, said that critics of his embattled
attorney general were ``trying to make a fuss over him'' but that
none of the charges against him had been substantiated.
   Reagan commented on Meese's troubles as he sat down to lunch
with cadets on the Coast Guard cutter ``Vigorous'' at the service's
New London, Conn., academy before making a speech about illegal
drug trafficking.
   Reagan toured the cutter and inspecting goods seized in drug
raids, including sawed-off shotguns, automatic weapons and
five-kilogram of cocaine.
   When he sat down to lunch with the cadets, a reporter said there
appeared to be a rebellion within conservative ranks about Meese
and the attorney general's firing of his spokesman, Terry Eastland,
a favorite of the right wing.
   ``I think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him,''
Reagan said of Meese. ``So far they're all empty charges.''

   Michael Dukakis, continuing his march
toward the Democratic nomination with a lopsided win in the Oregon
primary, touted himself as ``a candidate who can win the
presidency.'' Democratic rival Jesse Jackson, however, warned his
rival not to count him out yet.
   Vice President George Bush, who already has a mathematical lock
on the Republican nomination, picked up all 32 delegates in Oregon.
But Bush was getting less attention for winning another primary
than for trailing Dukakis in a series of surveys.
   And Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, who dropped out of the Republican race
back in March, skimmed off nearly a fifth of the vote in Oregon. It
doesn't do Dole any good at this point, but it points to weakness
that could hurt Bush in November.
   The primary season is now in its final phase, pointing toward
the closing contests June 7 in California, New Jersey, New Mexico
and Montana.
   Jackson has vowed to make an all-out effort in California, which
offers him a last chance to come out a winner before the Democratic
convention in July. He headed to the state while the votes were
being counted in Oregon, and vowed to press on.
   ``The support we're getting from the public is a mandate for
change, and we will continue,'' he told supporters Tuesday night at
a Hollywood hotel. ``We will not surrender.''
   Dukakis, who captured 55 percent of the vote to Jackson's 38
percent in Oregon, issued a victory statement that looked to the
coming primary contests _ but that also tacitly assumed that he
would be the one to face Bush in the fall.
   ``We will campaign hard for victories in California, New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico on June 7 and for the White House next
fall,'' said the Massachusetts governor, who has won nine of the
last 10 primary contests.
   ``Today the people of Oregon voted for change,'' he said. ``They
voted for a candidate who can win the presidency.''
   A pair of polls out today suggested Dukakis was widening his
lead over Bush in a hypothetical matchup. A poll by the Los Angeles
Times indicated that in California, Dukakis had a 17-point lead
over the vice president. In that survey, Dukakis had 53 percent to
Bush's 36 percent, with 11 percent undecided.
   The Times poll questioned 2,202 Californians by telephone over
six days, ending Monday night, with a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
   Another poll _ a nationwide Gallup survey commissioned by the
Boston Globe and Boston stations WEII and WCVB _ suggested Dukakis
was ahead of Bush 54 percent to 38 percent. The Gallup survey was
based on telephone interviews conducted May 13-15 with 1,204
registered voters, with a sampling error of 3 percentage points.
   Bush, asked about a poll from a day earlier by CBS News and The
New York Times, which also showed Dukakis with a double-digit lead,
acknowledged that the numbers weren't encouraging.
   ``No, they weren't,'' he said. But the vice president quickly
pointed to surveys taken just before the New Hampshire primary _
which he won handily _ that suggested he was well behind. And he
said he hasn't really gone head-to-head with his Democratic rival
yet, although he and Dukakis have frequently exchanged barbs.
   ``The thing hasn't really started in terms of Democrats versus
Republicans and we haven't gotten any of that in focus and it won't
be until after the convention,'' Bush said as he campaigned in
California.
   The vice president, who has always made much of his role as
President Reagan's loyal second, conceded that controversies in the
administration may be hurting him.
   He has been peppered with questions on the campaign trail about
administration dealings with Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, under indictment on drug charges, and about Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, who has refused to step down although he
is beset by legal troubles.
   Dukakis has been saying he doesn't attach much significance to
surveys focusing on a contest still months away. But he couldn't
conceal a certain amount of glee.
   ``All I can say is I think something is cooking out there,'' the
governor said Tuesday.
   Dukakis had spent the primary day at home in Massachusetts while
Jackson, who had campaigned heavily in Oregon, scoured the state
for a few more votes.
   The Massachusetts governor was heading to New Jersey for
campaign appearances later today.
   Dukakis has an overwhelming lead in the delegate race _ he has
1,643 to Jackson's 974, by the latest AP count _ but is still
several hundred short of the 2,081 needed to nominate. The
Massachusetts governor was taking 27 of the delegates in Oregon to
Jackson's 18.
   In Oregon, with all precincts reporting, it was 208,795, or 55
percent for Dukakis, to 143,593, or 38 percent for Jackson.
   On the Republican side, Bush had 189,239 votes, or 73 percent,
to Dole's 47,480, or 18 percent. Pat Robertson, the former
television evangelist who abandoned his Republican bid on Monday
and returned to his Christian Broadcasting Network on Tuesday, had
21,872 votes, or 8 percent.

<HEAD>Construction of Single-Family Homes Dips, Multi-Family Building
Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of single-family homes dipped in
April, the government said Wednesday, providing evidence that
higher mortgage interest rates may be dampening building activity.
   The Commerce Department said single-family home building dropped
6.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.10 million
units last month.
   Construction of multi-family units, which swing widely from
month to month, soared by 23.3 percent to a rate of 466,000 to
offset the single-family decline and produce an overall increase of
0.5 percent.
   Economists said construction was not at unhealthy levels,
particularly when compared with a sharp slump in December and
January. But they added that the increase in apartment building was
probably an aberration and that rising mortgage interest rates
likely would depress single-family construction.
   ``The single-family number is not a bad number, but I think it's
an indication that as rates rise through the year, it's going to
impact the housing market,'' said Martin A. Regalia, chief
economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were just under 10
percent through March, but began edging up in April and averaged
10.4 percent last week.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said investor fears of inflation pushed interest
rates higher earlier this year than many analysts anticipated.
Despite that, he said, surveys of home builders in May showed that
buying is holding up fairly well.
   ``Our major concern for the rest of the year is what this
inflation paranoia in the market is going to mean,'' Seiders added.
``... We're hoping that the inflation numbers themselves as they
come in will be pretty orderly and that this psychology will
break.''
   The overall 0.5 percent increase last month to 1.56 million
units at seasonally adjusted annual rate followed gains of 2.3
percent in March and 9.9 percent in February. But housing activity
was still 4.5 percent below last year, in part because of declines
in December and January.
   Housing starts plummeted 15.8 percent in December and fell 1.2
percent in January. Analysts attributed the slump to builders' fear
that the October stock market crash would discourage home buyers.
Since then, the economy has proved to be robust and interest rates
have emerged as the new threat to housing activity.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future construction
activity, fell 4.1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.42 million units. Single-family permits fell 6.8 percent,
while multi-family units rose 2.2 percent.
   ``I don't think this is the start of a big multi-family
construction boom,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions. ``Vacancy rates are still way too
high in most parts of the country, particularly in the South.''
   The vacancy rate for rental housing was 8 percent during the
first three months of 1988, well above the level of 5 percent to 6
percent that prevailed through the 1970s and the first half of the
1980s. The new tax law that took effect last year has also
depressed multi-family construction by removing many of the
benefits of investing in real estate.
   The overall April increase in housing starts was paced by a 22.4
percent rise in the Midwest and a 5.2 percent climb in the South.
Housing starts fell by 8.9 percent in the Northeast and 13.0
percent in the West.
   Obrinsky said that if the gains in the Midwest continue, it may
be an indication that the export-driven improvement in
manufacturing is transforming the Rust Belt into, if not an
economic hot spot, at least a warm spot.

   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr.
said today he is ``reasonably hopeful'' that the United States will
succeed in removing Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power.
   Baker spoke with reporters one day after President Reagan said
at a surprise news conference that he will not strike a deal that
would ``whitewash anyone'' in Panama.
   Both the president and his chief of staff declined to discuss
reports that the United States has offered to drop drug trafficking
charges against Noriega.
   ``The negotiations are underway,'' said Baker. ``Our policy is
that Noriega must go and indeed that remains our commitment.''
   Reagan, asked today as he visited the Coast Guard Academy in New
London, Conn., about Baker's comment that he is hopeful of getting
Noriega to give up power, the president replied, ``That's what
we're hoping and what we're trying to achieve.''
   He said he did not know how the negotiations would be affected
by Tuesday's 86-10 vote in the Senate for a nonbinding resolution
expressing opposition to any negotiations for a deal that would
involve dropping the indictment.
   ``I understand the frustration that was expressed by the Senate
and I am sympathetic to that,'' said Baker, a former Senate
Republican leader.
   ``The fact remains that the administration has a firm, fixed
policy that Noriega must go and we are working very hard to see
that that happens. We're working very hard to see that that
happens. I am reasonably hopeful that we'll get that result, but we
don't have it yet.''
   ``The idea of indicting the leaders of foreign governments is
fairly new,'' Baker said. ``It's not one of the traditional
instruments of foreign policy. But it certainly is something that
has had a concentrating effect on Noriega's mind, apparently, so by
whatever means, we're going to use that to our advantage to try to
implement administration policy, which is to see that Noriega
leaves power, leaves the country, and paves the way for democratic
rule in that nation.''
   Questions about Noriega and embattled Attorney General Edwin
Meese III dominated Reagan's meeting with reporters Tuesday. Reagan
also said no decisions were made at the White House on the basis of
astrological advice to first lady Nancy Reagan.
   When asked whether he believed in astrology himself, however, he
paused and replied, ``I don't guide my life by it, but I won't
answer the question the other way because I don't know enough about
it to say is there something to it or not.''
   Of Meese, the president said, ``I think that there's been a
wave, and for quite a long time ... in which accusation or
allegation is taken to mean conviction. And there's been too much
of that.''
   ``I think that for him to step aside would be what he himself
once said _ that he would then live for the rest of his life under
this cloud _ with nothing that had ever been proven.''
   The Justice Department has been rocked in recent weeks by unrest
and resignations stemming from criminal investigations of Meese's
affairs.
   On Panama, Reagan said much of what has been written about the
negotiations had been ``based on some kind of leaks or
misinformation, because there are no facts to sustain it.''
   In refusing to discuss the negotiations, Reagan said, ``It would
be foolish to do so. Some things you have to keep to yourself when
you're arguing with someone else.''
   Reagan also denied the administration knew long ago that Noriega
was involved in drug trafficking and chose not to act on the
knowledge.
   ``There had been some rumors ... but no one ever received or
could get evidence to substantiate those rumors,'' the president
said.
   Reagan opened his news conference with a statement applauding
the agreement to start Senate debate on the U.S.-Soviet
intermediate-range arms treaty. He described the March trade
figures, which showed a dramatic drop in the monthly deficit in the
balance of exports and imports, as ``the best news on this front
since March of 1985.''
   Reagan's last regularly scheduled news conference was Feb. 24.

   Mayor Bud Clark easily defeated 10
challengers for his job, but uncounted absentee ballots may decide
whether the eccentric tavern owner will face a runoff in his bid
for a second term.
   Clark needed one vote more than 50 percent of the total votes
cast Tuesday to win re-election outright, but final unofficial
results today showed he had only 49.8 percent.
   Clark, with 59,810 votes, was followed by former Police Chief
Ron Still with 40,960, or 33.5 percent, and former City
Commissioner Lloyd Anderson with 12,693, or 10.6 percent. Former
Police Chief Jim Davis was a distant fourth, with 4,832, or 4
percent.
   Jim Dodson, a spokesman for the Multnomah County elections
office, said absentee ballots would be counted by Friday. He said
he had no idea how many people had cast absentee votes.
   A runoff in November would be between the top two vote-getters.
   Also Tuesday, voters statewide approved a law requiring drivers
and passengers of motorcycles and mopeds to wear helmets. With
1,959 of the state's 2,338 precincts reported, the helmet proposal
was ahead by 381,488, or 68 percent, to 178,827, or 32 percent.
   Clark shocked the city four years ago by unseating incumbent
Frank Ivancie. Despite a series of crises that plagued the first
half of his term, polls showed him far ahead of the other
candidates in the non-partisan race.
   Clark decided to wait for complete returns before making a
victory speech.
   ``We led the way in showing you could upset an incumbent, and
now it looks like everyone wants to do the same thing,'' Clark said
in a telephone interview. ``I just want to get back to running the
city.''
   Still said he was confident there would be a runoff. The last
runoff in a Portland mayoral race was in 1956 when Terry Schrunk
defeated incumbent Fred Peterson.
   During Clark's first two years in office, Still and another
police chief resigned and Davis was fired in a dispute over a
Police Bureau audit.
   The other chief to resign was Penny Harrington, who left after
16 months as the first female chief of a big-city police department
in the United States. Her resignation came a day after a commission
that Clark appointed issued a report that criticized her management
and recommended that she be replaced.
   Portland's crime rate was the major issue in the mayor's race,
but Clark's opponents apparently were unable to convince voters
that he was directly responsible for the crime problem. Clark said
lowering the crime rate would be the top priority of his second
term.
   Clark, 57, has been criticized for his eccentricities, but there
were few campaign attacks on his personality. His trademark
``whoop, whoop'' cry is a staple of civic functions, and the
bicycling mayor has chronicled his political career with an
ever-present camera.

   Federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami told
House investigators today that ``I am not guilty but I am not
free,'' and demanded that they drop impeachment proceedings and
clear his name of misconduct charges brought by fellow judges.
   Hastings said he was the first federal judge in U.S. history to
be threatened with impeachment after his acquittal of criminal
charges at a jury trial.
   ``They found me not guilty of crimes I never committed,''
Hastings told the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice,
which opened impeachment hearings today.
   ``Let me make it very, very clear,'' he said in sworn testimony.
``I did not receive a bribe, I did not obstruct justice, I have not
betrayed the integrity of my office. I am not guilty but I am not
free.''
   Hastings denounced a report by a special five-judge panel of the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals accusing him of lying under oath
and manufacturing evidence at his bribery trial in 1983.
   ``I ask you in the name of decency, I ask you in the name of
justice, the American jury system and the American way of life, I
beg you, I beseech you _ hell no, I demand of you, that you set me
free!''
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida, was
acquitted five years ago of conspiring to solicit a $150,000 bribe
from two convicted racketeers.
   Today's hearing began with a review of evidence in the case by
New York lawyer John Doar, a former U.S. assistant attorney general
who supervised the appellate panel's investigation.
   Doar also wrote the panel's voluminous report accusing Hastings
of bribery conspiracy and obstruction of justice after a 3{-year
investigation that he said involved 2,800 documents and testimony
from 110 witnesses.
   The report was given to the House leadership in March 1987 by
the Judicial Conference of the United States, the chief
policymaking body of the federal judiciary, with the conclusion
that ``consideration of impeachment may be warranted.''
   At the outset of today's hearing, Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee that has studied the case for
more than a year, said he was deeply troubled that the charges
against Hastings might be racially and politically motivated.
   Conyers said the impeachment proceedings were ``exceedingly
difficult and trying'' because Hastings already has been acquitted
of criminal charges and because he is a black federal judge.
   Hastings sat silently with his lawyers at a side table as
Conyers said the subcommittee had ``taken cognizance of racially
motivated conduct in this country for many, many years,
particularly in the criminal justice system.''
   ``We are not unaware or naive about the troubling matters that
hover over this particular hearing today,'' he said.
   Conyers charged that the federal courts have become
``conservatized and in some instances politicized'' under the
Reagan administration. Referring to the Justice Department, he
added, ``never have we known an administration that has so
politicized the administration of law.''
   Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the
panel, declared that ``never has there been a hint ... that any
part of this inquiry was based on racial motivations.''
   He urged his colleagues to keep racial or political
considerations from influencing the proceedings and to concentrate
on its fact-finding mission in the case.
   Last April, the Supreme Court rejected a move by Hastings to
block the impeachment inquiry as unlawful.
   The high court left intact a 1980 law under which Hastings'
fellow judges asked the House to consider impeaching him for
alleged judicial misconduct. The justices also refused to block
release of confidential grand jury documents concerning Hastings to
the Judiciary panel.
   A team of House lawyers has been studying a 381-page report,
prepared by a special five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which concluded there was ``clear and
convincing evidence'' that Hastings conspired with Washington
lawyer William A. Borders Jr. to solicit a bribe from two
racketeers in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences.
   In addition, the panel accused Hastings of trying to conceal the
conspiracy by giving false testimony and fabricating evidence at
his highly publicized trial in Miami four years ago.
   Hastings was acquitted of the bribery-conspiracy charges, but
Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges of
conspiring to arrange the alleged bribe from convicted racketeers
Frank and Tom Romano.
   The judicial panel concluded that Hastings ``attempted to
corruptly use his office for personal gain.'' Its report said
``such conduct cannot be excused or condoned even after Judge
Hastings has been acquitted of the criminal charges.''
   An impeachment resolution against Hastings has been introduced
by Reps. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., and F. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
   Hastings, who was nominated by President Carter in 1979, had
claimed previously that his prosecution was racially and
politically motivated. ``If I were white, I wouldn't be facing
impeachment,'' he said.
   If the full House votes impeachment, the Senate would conduct a
trial. Conviction by the Senate would result in Hastings' removal
from the federal bench.

<HEAD>Scottish Island Offered For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 350-acre Scottish island with
rolling pastures, ruins of a chapel, two four-bedroom farmhouses
and a harbor was offered for sale Wednesday for more than $280,000.
   Savills, an Edinburgh real estate firm, said the island of Pabay
in Scotland's Western Isles is surrounded by seas teeming with
seals, porpoises and otters, was once a refuge for pirates, and has
been inhabited since the 13th century.
   The island is licensed by the Post Office to produce its own
stamps, and because it has no postal workers, its handful of
inhabitants are paid to collect their mail from a post office on
the Isle of Skye two miles away.
   Savills advertised it as ideal for someone seeking a sanctuary
from the pressures of modern life. It asked for offers of more than
$280,000.
   ``For that money you would be lucky to find a one-bedroom flat
in central London,'' said spokesman Andrew Smith. ``But that's the
way the property market is.
   ``There are certain limitations on getting to it, but if you
want a bit of privacy it's the ideal situation,'' he said.
   The island currently is a commercial farm, and the owner's
identity has not been disclosed, Smith said.
   Religious persecution on the mainland brought the island's
earliest settlers seeking sanctuary 700 years ago, he said. By
1549, Scottish writer Dean Munro described it as ``full of woods,
good for fishing, and a main shelter for thieves and cutthroats.''

   The Soviet ambassador said in a letter published
Wednesday that Moscow has lost radio contact with one of its
nuclear-powered reconnaissance satellites.
   British legislator Irvine Patnick said he wrote to the
ambassador, Leonid Zamyatin, after hearing news reports that Cosmos
1900, which tracks U.S. naval movements, could crash in Britain and
bring significant amounts of nuclear radiation with it.
   He said Zamyatin apparently wanted to allay any fears when he
wrote that ``the satellite continues its oriented flight, and all
major systems operate according to program.''
   As for radiation, Zamyatin wrote that Cosmos 1900 ``is equipped
with the systems providing radiological security on the termination
of the flight.''
   Concern over the satellite's nuclear payload has been mounting
since the official Soviet news agency Tass reported May 11 that it
might fall to Earth in August or September.
   U.S. experts have claimed that its radioactive components would
probably not burn up on re-entering the atmosphere, as Tass had
implied.
   The precise effect of the satellite's re-entry remain a topic
for debate.
   Don Kerr, an expert on military and space technology at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the
satellite's small nuclear reactor would ``absolutely not'' survive
re-entry intact but some radiation would inevitably cling to the
satellite's parts.
   Two Soviet satellites have fallen to Earth before, in northern
Canada in 1978, and in the Indian Ocean in 1983. The Canadian
satellite gave off small amounts of radiation.

<TEXT>
   The attorney general of Wisconsin told a House
panel Wednesday that federal laws, money and personnel will be
needed to keep the peace between Chippewa Indians and non-Indians
in the northern part of his state.
   ``I am convinced that a greater federal presence, with more
assurance of aggressive prosecution of those persons interfering
with federally protected rights, will greatly reduce the potential
for anti-Indian racists to pursue violence,'' state Attorney
General Donald J. Hanaway said.
   The dispute over Chippewa hunting and fishing rights in Northern
Wisconsin was the focus of a hearing by the House Judiciary
committee on civil rights. Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., is chairman,
and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner is the ranking
Republican.
   Sensenbrenner said he was advised by Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel that no current federal money was avaiable for a financial
settlement between the state and the Chippewa.
   Hanaway said that ``there is a clear potential for violence in
the future'' as a result of court rulings granting substantial
off-reservation hunting and fishing rights based on treaties of
1837 and 1842. There are six Chippewa bands with reservations in
Wisconsin.
   The attorney general said ``a very small and vocal minority'' in
Northern Wisconsin ``persists in engaging in racist anti-Indian
activity, under the guise of treaty rights issues.''
   Hanaway and other witnesses said there was near-violence during
the last several Indian spearfishing seasons, prevented only by a
strong law enforcement presence.
   The attorney general said legislation is needed to allow federal
law enforcement officials to effectively assist state and local
authorities.
   ``Additionally, I would urge this committee to support federal
appropriations to assist states in providing necessasry law
enforcement service,'' he added.
   James H. Schlender, executive administrator of the Great Lakes
Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, called for federal legislation
making it a crime to interfere with the exercise of federal treaty
protected rights.
   ``Existing laws, both federal and state, leave ambiguity as to
the duties of federal and state law enforcement officials,'' he
said. ``This ambiguity must be cleared up. Treaty rights must be
protected.''
   Referring to the relative calm of the spring spearfishing
season, Schlender said, ``a temporary lid appears to have been
placed upon the boiling pot of hatred in Wisconsin'' against
Indians.
   The commission is an intertribal organization of 11 Lake
Superior Chippewa Tribes from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.
   In a report to the committee, the tribal attorney for the Lac du
Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewas said Northern Wisconsin
has experienced ``an outpouring of racist backlash which has gone
well beyond mere opposition to treaty rights.''
   Attorney James M. Jannetta said, ``Its intensity and virulence
has shocked the Chippewa people.
   ``So far the incidents of violence have been minor, but as the
racist reaction builds, people of goodwill on both sides wonder how
long this can remain the case.''
   Jannetta said that in the spring 1988 spearfishing season, the
Lac du Flambeau ``faced massive harassment throughout the season,
and it was only an equally massive law enforcement effort that
protected the physical safety of the spearers.''

   The Soviet Writers Union has decided to create a
museum to Boris Pasternak, who was forced out of the organization
for publishing his Nobel Prize-winning novel ``Doctor Zhivago,'' a
newspaper said Wednesday.
   The weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said the secretariat of the
Writers Union had decided to turn Pasternak's house in the rural
writers' colony of Peredelkino just west of Moscow into a museum.
   It was at that house that Pasternak wrote the novel that won him
the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Pasternak was forced to turn down the prize and died in disgrace
in 1960.
   But the Soviet Union is re-evaluating Pasternak under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected
topics.
   Poet Andrei Voznesensky told the newspaper that Pasternak name
remains ``in the epicenter of a literary struggle'' and that honors
now bestowed on him were possible only because of glasnost.
   Pasternak was reinstated to the Writers Union in February 1987,
and ``Doctor Zhivago'' was published earlier this year in the
literary journal Novy Mir.

   City officials are proposing a lottery to decide
demonstration times at the official protest grounds near the site
of the Democratic National Convention.
   The plan was proposed Tuesday during a meeting with
representatives of the Atlanta chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which has criticized the city for being slow to
establish procedures for protests.
   Atlanta '88, the non-profit committee helping stage the
convention, plans to lease a parking lot near the Omni and equip
the site with a stage and loudspeakers.
   A single lottery to draw times for using the protest area
``solves some problems but not others,'' said Gene Guerrero,
executive director of the local ACLU chapter. ``If you have it
right before the convention, that means no one can plan.''
   However, he added, an early lottery might leave out some
protesters late in applying. Two lotteries _ one in June and one
just before the convention _ might be acceptable, Guerrero said.

<TEXT>
   A policeman accused by black
squatters of organizing vigilante gangs was killed in a shootout
with a suicidal white man far from the black townships where the
officer usually worked.
   Warrant Officer Hendrick Barnard, a Cape Town policeman for 20
years, was one of two officers killed Tuesday night by a former
mental patient who had been threatening to commit suicide at his
house.
   The 30-year-old man, identified as Christopher Du Plooy, later
was killed by officers who stormed the house in Fish Hoek, a
coastal town on the Cape Peninsula.
   Barnard, who was white, usually worked in impoverished black
townships and squatter camps 15 miles away on the Cape Flats east
of Cape Town. Last year, he was injured in a hand grenade attack in
one township.
   In the past 10 years, many blacks said Barnard was connected
with attacks and factional fighting aimed at intimidating or
displacing squatters.
   Some squatters have banded together to resist attempts to
relocate them, and the government considers other squatter
communities strongholds of anti-apartheid militants.
   Barnard has been mentioned frequently in an ongoing court action
filed by squatters who were burned out of their shacks in a section
of the Crossroads squatter complex in 1986.
   The plaintiffs allege that Barnard and other officers either
encouraged or condoned an onslaught on the squatter camp by black
vigilantes. Some witnesses have testified they saw Barnard in a van
leading a force of 1,000 vigilantes, and others say they saw him
distributing incendiary devices.
   Scores of people were killed and more than 70,000 burned out of
their homes during a series of attacks at Crossroads in May and
June 1986.
   Barnard, in a sworn affidavit, said police tried to stop the
violence but were unable to move through the densely packed
shanties in vehicles and considered it too dangerous to go on foot.
   Barnard was given a commendation in 1983 for his work in
cracking a black car theft and housebreaking ring. In 1986, after
complaints by blacks about Barnard intensified, his superiors took
the unusual step of introducing him to newsmen and allowing him to
answer questions.
   His official police record says he frequently worked ``in
exceedingly dangerous circumstances during which he at times barely
escaped with his life.''

   Pat Robertson said Wednesday that
U.S. intelligence cannot counter his claim there might be Soviet
missiles in Cuba, repeating a never-proven contention from his
failed Republican presidential campaign.
   On the second day of his return to his Christian Broadcasting
Network's ``700 Club'' program, Robertson said he was victimized by
the media that was playing ``gotcha'' with his campaign.
   ``It isn't so much to learn what it is you've got to say, but
sort of can we pick a fact that is erronous and can we play `I
gotcha','' he said of the media's reporting of his statements.
   Robertson stunned his rivals when he said during a February
campaign debate that the Soviets maintained nuclear missiles in
Cuba.
   ``I never claimed to have proof the missiles were there,'' he
said Wednesday.
   During the debate Robertson said, ``Information came to me that
the Soviets, in violation of the so-called Khrushchev-Kennedy
accords, have put some SS-4s and 5s in Cuba.''
   During the televised appearance, Robertson offered pictures and
testimony from unnamed sources that he said led to the conclusion
that there was a possibility that the missiles existed. Asked why
the information was not better publicized, Robertson said the
material was being deliberately withheld to aid in the ratification
of the U.S.-Soviet missile treaty.
   ``The fix is in, that's why. The deal has been signed and
everybody wants it to go through,'' he said.
   Likewise, Robertson said the campaign statement that he knew the
location of American hostages was exaggerated by the media.
Robertson said the statement was a ``throwaway line'' at the end of
an interview, and that CBN knew only the general location of some
hostages.
   Robertson said he would show videotapes on Thursday of
depositions taken in his $33 million libel suit against former Rep.
Pete McCloskey. The former California congressman charged Robertson
evaded combat duty in the Korean War by using his father's
influence, who was a U.S. senator from Virginia.

   Police fired tear gas and smoke bombs
Wednesday to halt a rally and march to the U.S. Embassy by
protesters demanding that deposed President Ferdinand Marcos be
allowed to return for his mother's funeral.
   Organizers said at least four women and two children were hurt.
Police said there were minor injuries to several demonstrators but
did not give a figure.
   About 5,000 demonstrators rallied to urge the government allow
the exiled Marcos to return to attend the funeral of his mother,
Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4.
   A breakaway group of 2,000 demonstrators, chanting ``If you want
trouble, we will give you trouble!'' later marched toward the
embassy and were blocked near City Hall by 50 policemen,
journalists said.
   A police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when
they started throwing stones at the officers, who fought back with
truncheons and later used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the
marchers.
   The marchers later regrouped in the central Bonifacio Square to
protest the dispersal.
   Rows of barbed wire and 400 policemen and soldiers backed by
four firetrucks and two water cannons blocked all roads leading to
the presidential palace.
   ``Any dispersal is a curtailment of the people's right to
peaceably assemble and march,'' said rally leader Salvador Panelo.
``It only demonstrates the weakness of this government because it
is afraid of the people's voice.''
   Col. Emiliano Templo, deputy commander of the Capital Command,
allowed protesters to hold a protest vigil Wednesday night.
   About 100 Marcos supporters with red, white and blue balloons
waited for their companions near the main road leading to the
palace, but they peacefully dispersed at sundown after most of the
earlier protesters did not arrive.
   Rally leaders want President Corazon Aquino to reconsider her
refusal to allow Marcos to return for his mother's funeral. Marcos
lives in Hawaii, where he fled after the February 1986 revolt which
toppled his 20-year regime.
   ``We are going to appeal again ... that they allow the return of
President Marcos if only for humanitarian considerations,'' said
Fernando Diaz, president of the Long Live the Filipino Movement.

   The New York Stock Exchange is donating $50,000
for a monument to the veterans of the Korean War.
   Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan presented the money Tuesday
to Mayor Edward I. Koch, who formed the New York Korean Veterans
Memorial Commission to help raise $2 million for a monument to be
built in Battery Park in lower Manhattan.
   Thomas W. Evans, co-chairman of the commission, said the
commission also will establish ``a living memorial'' to provide
social services for Korean War vets.
   About 53,000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean War, which
lasted from 1950 to 1953. The Republic of Korea lost 70,000 in its
armed forces.
   Evans said a competition will be held to design the monument.

   The Soviet Union acknowledged Wednesday that
something exploded at one of its chemical factories last week, but
denied U.S. claims that it was rocket fuel used for a new
long-range nuclear missile.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said three
people were killed and five injured in the explosion May 12 in a
storage area of the plant at Pavlograd, about 500 miles southwest
of Moscow in the Ukraine.
   He said the chemicals involved were explosives used in civilian
industry, not fuel for the new SS-24 intercontinental ballistic
missile.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Tuesday the Pavlograd plant is
the sole facility for manufacturing the main rocket motors for the
SS-24.
   Gerasimov said in a telephone interview he did not know whether
the plant made either the motors or fuel for them. He said the
explosion occurred at 7:15 a.m. and that casualties were minimized
because the storage area was highly automated.
   A brief report by the Tass news agency's English-language
service said 12 tons of ``quarry powder'' blew up. Its
Russian-language report identified the material as ammonite and
said it exploded in a loading area of an internal warehouse at the
Pavlogradsky Chemical Factory.
   Ammonite is an explosive compound of 70 percent to 90 percent
ammonium nitrate and saltpeter, or potassium nitrate.
   According to the Tass report in Russian, the factory makes
industrial explosive materials. It identified them as rock
ammonium, alumotol and other ammonia products.
   The U.S. Defense Department said the explosion ``destroyed
several buildings at a Soviet propellant plant in Pavlograd.''
   An American source in Washington said the explosion ``sure tore
that plant up,'' but Gerasimov said it did not cause major damage.
``It's not catastrophic,'' he told The Associated Press.
   One Washington source said U.S. spy satellites detected the
explosion.
   Pavlograd is a city of 122,000 people about 30 miles east of
Dnepropetrovsk, a major industrial center. Gerasimov said there was
no evacuation of the area after the explosion.
   Tass reported that, nine hours after the explosion, Mayor I.N.
Prikhodko assured residents over the local radio station there was
no danger to health or the environment. A regional health official
repeated the message the next day, the agency said.
   Its report, which said the cause was being investigated, was the
first on the explosion by national Soviet media.
   The SS-24 carries 10 warheads and can be launched from
underground silos or rail cars. Deployment began last year.
   U.S. officials said the Soviets probably would not be able to
resume SS-24 production for at least six months.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian official predicted on
Wednesday that the problem of 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon would
be solved if fighting between rival Shiite Moslem factions in south
Beirut was stopped.
   Acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed Besharati made the
announcement as Syria and Iran disagreed on ways to end 13 days of
combat that has killed 243 people and wounded 762.
   ``The case of kidnapping (foreigners) in Lebanon is part of the
crisis which Lebanon is passing through. I believe that if we could
end the state of war currently prevailing, then definitely the
other case would be solved too,'' Besharati said without further
elaboration.
   Besharati has been mediating an end to the bloody dispute
between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal, Arabic for hope.
   The Iranian envoy made the statement on the foreign hostages in
response to reporters' questions after a meeting with acting
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Most of the hostages, including nine Americans, are believed
held by Hezbollah-affiliated Shiite zealots based in the
16-square-mile slums of south Beirut, where fighting has been
raging since May 6.
   Syria on Sunday massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armored
vehicles on the southern, western and northern edges of south
Beirut and its officers said the army was prepared to move in to
quell the fighting.
   Asked whether the Syrians would deploy in south Beirut,
Besharati said: ``It is neither in Syria's interest to deploy in
south Beirut nor does the whole population want Syria to enter
south Beirut.''
   Asked on whether his efforts would lead Syria to reverse its
decision to move into south Beirut, Besharati said: ``Certainly it
would lead to this.''
   But Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass, who made an
unscheduled visit to Beirut Wednesday, said the Syrian deployment
in south Beirut was ``imperative.''
   ``Entering the suburb is imperative. The suburb is militarily
fallen, we have ringed it from all sides. Let all the Lebanese be
(reassured),'' Tlass told reporters. He did not elaborate on the
remark.
   Besharati said Iran was proposing the ``formation of a force to
preserve security'' in the bomb-ravaged slums after arranging a
solid cease-fire.
   Eight cease-fire accords have collapsed since the fighting broke
out. Each side blamed the other for violating them.
   Asked if the Syrians would be represented in this force,
Besharati said: ``We and our Syrian brothers would guarantee this
force.''
   But the chief of Syria's military intelligence in Lebanon, Brig.
Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, said Besharati's efforts to arrange a political
settlement were not succeeding.
   ``We are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problem
and stop the bleeding in south Beirut,'' Kenaan said after a
meeting with Besharati. ``But it seems that this effort is not
leading to a tangible outcome.''
   He said Syria had made the decision to storm south Beirut and
``it awaits nothing but implementation.''
   Contradicting Besharati's remarks, Kenaan said: ``The population
has requested the deployment of the Syrian forces to end their
ordeal. We cannot but meet the people's pleas.''
   Amal leader Nabih Berri also called for the deployment of Syrian
troops in south Beirut.
   ``Amal believes that a sisterly security force regarded as a
friend to both sides should deploy in south Beirut to protect the
people,'' Berri said after a one-hour session with Besharati.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arab
ally in the war with Iraq.
   Syria, however, recently has been alarmed by Iran's efforts to
dispute its role in Lebanon by trying to dominate the 1.2 million
Shiites, the nation's largest sect, through Hezbollah.
   The Iranian Embassy said Besharati would meet Lebanon's
Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, on Thursday.
   Lebanese security sources said Besharati was meeting Lebanese
officials to seek support for an Iranian proposal to end the
inter-Shiite clashes.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Iranian
envoy proposed a compromise in which Syria would deploy troops only
in the northern districts of the slums, where Amal still holds
positions after being dislodged from 90 percent of the contested
terrain.

   A junior high school principal says
two girls will be given detention for two weeks for stealing a pair
of rabbits to save them from being slaughtered in science class.
   ``There may have been a better way to handle it, to bring it to
the attention of the administration, rather than `rabbitnapping,'''
Comstock Junior High School Principal Rich Rapheal said.
   ``We like brought them to the office. If we didn't do anything,
they would be dead,'' said Wendy, 15, one of the students. The
girls were not identified except as Wendy and Johanna, 14.
   Rapheal said the rabbits were part of an agriculture sciences
class in which the processing of livestock is demonstrated from
birth to slaughter.
   ``They are killed humanely,'' Rapheal said. ``They're hit on the
head _ I know that doesn't sound humane _ with a club designed for
that.''
   ``They could have showed us a film,'' Johanna said.
   The principal said the class was warned days ahead that the
rabbits would be killed Tuesday, and students who objected could
have been excused.
   Still, there will be changes in the class, Rapheal said.
   ``They'll still have the unit on processing of meat and
livestock, but probably not kill them,'' he said.

   A convicted embezzler has been
acquitted on an escape charge after convincing a jury he fled a
prison camp to avoid becoming a drug courier.
   A Garfield County jury accepted Robert D. Tate's defense that he
fled after two other inmates threatened him unless he smuggled
contraband into the minimum-security prison.
   The jury took 3{ hours Friday to acquit Tate, 42, who escaped
from the Rifle Correctional Facility.
   ``I was under a lot of pressure there,'' Tate said. ``I was
forced to leave.''
   Deputy District Attorney Ken Jaynes argued that the duress
defense requires that a person surrender to authorities immediately
upon reaching safety.
   Six days after the escape, police apprehended Tate in Las Vegas,
Nev.
   Tate was sent to prison in Canon City to complete the
embezzlement sentence. He pleaded guilty in 1980 to embezzling more
than $93,000 from a company he had started.

   Scientists have fed a pollutant into a cloud and
demonstrated a chemical reaction involved in acid rain, a report
says.
   Researchers released sulfur dioxide into a cloud that covered
the top of a British hill, and measurements showed it reacted with
natural hydrogen peroxide, according to a report in Thursday's
issue of the British journal Nature.
   The rate of reaction was comparable to that expected from
laboratory experiments, they wrote.
   The reaction produces sulfate, which reacts with atmospheric
moisture to form sulfuric acid, a constituent of acid rain.
   Little sulfate was detected in the experiment, which was
performed in December 1985. But significant levels appeared when
the experiment was done in springtime, when more sun was available
to promote sulfur dioxide reactions, researchers wrote.
   Acid rain also can include nitric acids formed from pollutants
called nitrogen oxides. It can harm vegetation and acquatic life,
and damage buildings and monuments.

   Vice President George Bush visited the scene
of a recent drug raid today, saying, ``It's not show business. You
have to learn and understand and then take action.''
   The Republican presidential contender, on a campaign trip to
California, went to a ``rock house,'' the name for locations where
the cocaine derivative crack is sold and used in south central Los
Angeles.
   He spent about 15 minutes in the storefront location and talked
to Det. Mike Brown about a major drug raid and cocaine that police
said was found there on May 2.
   ``I'm talking to the people who are actually out there waging
the battle. You learn from it. It brings it home dramatically,''
Bush said.
   He commended the police who are ``physically coming in to
relieve a neighborhood of this kind of filth.''
   Asked the value of such a visit, Bush said, ``Anybody who has
practical experience, you learn from them. It's not show business.
You have to learn and understand and then take action. That's what
I want to do if I'm elected president. It's been extraordinarily
helpful.''

   What else could The Tombstone Epitaph
possibly be but a funeral service publication?
   That's what the folks assumed at ``The Serials Directory,'' an
international reference book which lists publications and their
subjects.
   ``Broke me up,'' says Wallace E. Clayton, editor of the Epitaph,
a nationally circulated monthly journal of Western history.
   Ellen Rice, data-base coordinator for ``The Serials Directory,''
which is based in Birmingham, Ala., said the mixup was ``definitely
our fault.''
   Someone apparently misread classification numbers, and, together
with the name Epitaph, concluded that it was a funeral service
directory, she said.
   ``The Serials Directory,'' consisting of three volumes, is
mailed to libraries, colleges and universities, among other
institutions. It sells for $289.
   Ms. Rice said the error ``is funny,'' but it will be corrected
and the Epitaph will be listed under publications dealing with the
history of North America.

   For some 300 physics students from
Pittsburgh area high schools, this week's amusement park trip
consisted of more than just rides and cotton candy. It also
included a test organized by the High School Physics Teachers
Association.
   The students were asked, for example, to estimate the number of
lights on the Ferris wheel at Kennywood Park, or the amount of
paint it would take to paint all of the tables there.
   ``Know your mass,'' two questions began. ``Estimate the vertical
distance traveled by the left end of the Noah's Ark (ride) since
1950,'' and ``What is the weight of the water in newtons in the
Kennywood Lagoon?''
   Mark Bentsen, 17, a student at Pittsburgh's Shady Side Academy,
stood under the roller coaster and did his best to crack questions
on potential versus kinetic energy.
   ``It would be nice to say I want to be a physicist,'' Bentsen
said, ``but I'm more into financial planning.''

   Officials said Kinney was recognized for ``fostering a
cooperative working relationship between American and French

   From 1980 until his recent retirement, Kinney managed the
department's Agricutural Research Service, the largest diversified
program of agricultural research in the world. The agency has 2,800
scientists and engineers at 127 locations in the United States and
five overseas laboratories.
   Kinney, 62, began his USDA career 25 years ago. He grew up on
his family's poultry farm in Stoughton, Mass., near Boston, and
holds degrees from the University of Massachusetts and a doctorate
in genetics from the University of Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has refunded
$55.9 billion to taxpayers this year, about one-eighth of the
personal income taxes that were collected in advance in 1987.
   The IRS said Wednesday that 65.1 million couples and
individuals, or 80.4 percent of the returns that have been
processed so far this year, qualified for refunds. The refunds
averaged $860.
   The total number of refunds is up slightly, from 64.8 million
last year. The amount refunded declined, from $56.1 billion, as did
the average, from $866.
   This year's refunds represent about 12.4 percent of the
estimated $450 billion that the IRS collected through withholding
and in quarterly payments last year. The proportion of collections
refunded is about the same as a year ago.
   Through May 13, the IRS had received almost 101 million returns,
an increase of 3.3 percent from the 97.7 million tallied during the
same period a year ago. The agency has processed 80.9 billion, up 1
percent from the 80 billion last year.
   The number of taxpayers who filed the simplest return, the Form
1040EZ, rose by 8.7 percent over last year, from 16.7 million to
18.2 million. Filers of Form 1040A, were off slightly, from 17.6
million to 17.4 million. The number filing the long form, 1040,
increased 3.3 percent, from 63.4 million to 65.4 million.

   A City Council meeting turned into a
slapstick brawl with members punching, kicking and throwing pieces
of cream pie at each other.
   It started Tuesday night when councilman Antonio Carlos
Fernandes showed up with a cream pie he said was ``in honor of
Mayor Janio Quadros, for having 107 of his bills approved.''
   Fernandes' political opponent, Geraldo Blota, criticized the
gesture as silly. Fernandes threw a piece of pie at Blota, who
responded by punching Fernandes in the stomach.
   Members of the council quickly took sides, punching and shoving
each other on the assembly floor. The remainder of the pie was
knocked off a desk and splattered over a journalist covering the
session.
   ``Slapstick in the Sao Paulo Assembly,'' read the headline on a
story Wednesday in the O Globo newspaper of Rio de Janeiro.
   Security guards broke up the fighting and removed the remains of
the cake. After the councilors cleaned up and cooled off, they got
back to business.

   U.S. officials are bracing for the possibility
that Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will offer to cut Soviet
troop strength sharply in Eastern Europe, a development he has been
hinting at for nearly two years.
   One possibility, said a U.S. official, is that Gorbachev will
use the May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow to suggest that the
superpowers sit down this fall and discuss cutting their ground
forces in Europe by as much as 25 percent.
   Another official said Gorbachev may wait until after the summit
to make a dramatic gesture, possibly announcing the unilateral
withdrawal of 50,000 to 70,000 Soviet troops. Another U.S. official
said Tuesday as many as 100,000 Red Army troops could be pulled
back. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev wants to cut conventional forces to free up money
badly needed for his economic reforms, Robert Legvold, director of
Soviet studies at Columbia University, said in a recent study.
   ``Were he able to demobilize a large fraction of the 20
divisions currently deployed in East Germany, the gains to his
modernization program would be sizable,'' Legvold said.
   Condoleeza Rice of Stanford Univerisity told a House committee
on April 27 that ``the goal of current Soviet strategy, including
their extraordinary flexibility in arms control, is to create a
benign foreign policy environment.''
   ``This would allow the Soviets to divert resources from direct
investment in defense and to reap the economic benefits of
technological cooperation with the advanced capitalist states,''
Rice said.
   Western analysts have been predicting such a development since
June 1986 when Gorbachev and Warsaw Pact allies, meeting in
Budapest, called for the two sides to reduce their forces along the
Central Front by about 500,000 soldiers apiece by the early 1990s.
   One Soviet academic, Vitaly Zhurkin, subsequently proposed cuts
of 1 million men on each side.
   Zhurkin and other scholars in Kremlin think tanks have devoted
considerable ink to expanding on the doctrine of ``reasonable
sufficiency'' introduced by Gorbachev at the 27th Communist Party
Congress in February 1986.
   Gorbachev, Zhurkin and others argue that a nation wastes money
by building more armaments than it needs to defend itself, and that
the Soviet Union does not need its current vast tank army to deter
an attack.
   ``Conventional military forces must be lowered to a level of
reasonable sufficiency, that is to a level essential for solving
only defensive tasks,'' two of Zhurkin's coleagues, Andrei Kokoshin
and V. Larionov, wrote in a watershed article published in August
1987.
   To achieve this, ``certain changes will have to occur in the way
military professionals think,'' Legvold quoting them as writing.
   Soviet military officers, including Chief of Staff Marshal
Sergei Akhromeyev, responded with what they called ``defensive
sufficiency,'' a force adequate to deal ``crushing retaliatory
blows,'' in other words a massive counterattack, against any NATO
aggression.
   Rice, who met last month in Moscow with Soviet military officers
and scholars, described the internal debate in the Kremlin as a
``battle royal.''
   U.S. government analysts conclude that Gorbachev won the debate,
and may be ready to unilaterally cut Warsaw Pact forces by 50,000
to 100,000 troops to win support for a new round of East-West
negotiations on conventional forces.
   According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London, the Soviet Union keeps 380,000 ground troops at a high
state of readiness in East Germany, 80,000 in Czechoslovakia and
40,000 in Poland.
   A unilateral Soviet withdrawal of that scale would have ``little
impact strategically,'' one U.S official said. But the political
payoff could be immense in Western Europe, where polls show great
enthusiasm for Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies.
   Gorbachev appears to have come to the same conclusion reached by
many in the West, including Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, that reducing the Soviet
advantage in conventional forces in Europe would help the long-term
Kremlin goal of sharply reducing nuclear arsenals.
   The Warsaw Pact holds a 2-to-1 edge along the Central Front,
according to Pentagon estimates, and the IISS in London says the
Soviet bloc has 52,200 tanks compared with 22,214 in NATO.
   The RAND Corp., in a study of the conventional balance released
last January, concluded that because of the Warsaw Pact advantage,
any East-West agreement on conventional reductions should be on a
5-to-1 ratio against the Soviet bloc.
   Earlier talks on reducing conventional forces have been stalled
since 1973, failing even to produce agreement on the number of
troops on each side.
   Reagan administration officials believe a breakthrough may be
possible because Gorbachev seems to have concluded that the Warsaw
Pact must make larger cuts than NATO to redress its geographic and
numerical advantages.

<HEAD>Sakharov Criticizes Gorbachev Over Ethnic Unrest in Soviet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov
sent a letter to Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticizing him for his
handling of recent ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union, according to
a human rights group here.
   The Soviet authorities' response to ethnic grievances proves
that ``glasnost appears to be crushed when it is most needed,''
wrote the Nobel Prize-winning physicist.
   The letter was written last month but never publicized,
according to the authoritative Amsterdam-based Bukovsky Foundation,
which distributed excerpts of the letter translated into English at
its annual Sakharov Conference.
   The Moscow-based nuclear physicist, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize, had been invited to the conference named in his honor, but
did not attend the gathering on ``Blank Spots in Soviet History.''
   Also on Wednesday, expelled Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky,
for whom the foundation is named, predicted that Gorbachev soon
would have to increase consumer prices, and that could lead to
unrest in Soviet society.
   In his letter, addressed personally to the Soviet leader,
Sakharov criticized Gorbachev's handling of recent unrest in
Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region, where ethnic Armenians
clashed with Azerbaijanis in February.
   ``In the context of perestroika, the Armenian population of
Karabakh raised its hopes that there may be a constitutional
solution to the problem,'' said Sakharov, who was exiled to the
city of Gorky from 1980-86 for criticizing his nation's
intervention in Afghanistan.
   ``Glasnost,'' or openness on selected social topics, and
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, are key elements of Gorbachev's
program of social and economic reforms.
   In his letter, Sakharov outlined how the region's Armenians had
sought reunification with the neighboring Soviet republic of
Armenia.
   ``Instead of following a normal constitutional means of
examining the application, Soviet authorities began to rely on
maneuvers and persuasion, directed primarily toward Armenians,''
said the letter, which gave no details.
   ``At the same time, reports began to appear in the (Soviet)
press and on television in which the events were presented in a
partial and one-sided fashion, and the lawful requests of the
Armenian population were described as being extremist.
   ``Thus it seems that a negative answer was preconditioned,''
Sakharov's letter said. Dozens of people have died in the
Nagorno-Karabakh clashes.
   According to the Bukovsky Foundation, a lobby group for Soviet
dissidents, Gorbachev told Sakharov soon after receiving the letter
that it would be published in the popular English-language weekly
Moscow News if the dissident was willing to ``soften some of his
language in the letter.''
   Sakharov refused, the foundation's preface to the letter said,
adding that the document, signed ``with deep and sincere respect,''
was never published.
   He also criticized the Soviet leadership for refusing the return
to the Crimea of ethnic Tatars, of whom 238,000 were sent to remote
parts of the Soviet Union after Josef Stalin accused them of
collaboration with Nazi Germany in 1944.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bukovsky predicted that Gorbachev would have
to increase consumer prices by up to 75 percent across the board in
the near future.
   ``In the current atmosphere where people are encouraged to voice
their protests ... it is inevitable that such increase of prices
will lead to industrial unrest and strikes and demonstrations,''
Bukovsky said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``Next year will be a nightmare,'' Bukovsky said, adding the
revolt would be a ``dress rehearsal'' for the ultimate collapse of
communism.
   Bukovsky added that civil and industrial unrest is likely to
continue also in Poland, Hungary and other East Bloc nations, with
Soviet troops unable to quell the disturbances because of the
upheavals at home.
   Bukovsky, who settled in Britain after his 1976 expulsion from
the Soviet Union, spent 12 years in Soviet jails and labor camps on
charges of slandering the Soviet state and anti-Soviet agitation
and propaganda.

<HEAD>Wife Of Palestinian Activist Seeks Help From Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Palestinian-rights activist
Mubarak Awad launched a Capitol Hill lobbying effort Wednesday in
hope of persuading lawmakers to help her husband fight deportation
from Israel.
   Nancy Nye, Awad's wife, said she has not sensed a strong support
of Congress in the matter so far.
   ``I'm presenting this case to congressional members, that they
will look at this case and look at the way the government of Israel
is dealing with Palestinian residents,'' said Ms. Nye.
   She said she intends to visit congressional offices _ including
those of Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and John Glenn, D-Ohio,
and Reps. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, and Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. _ on
Wednesday and Thursday before returning to Israel on Friday.
   Ms. Nye said U.S. lawmakers could ask Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to consider changing his decision to order Awad
deported.
   Awad, 44, a naturalized U.S. citizen who has a home in
Wapakoneta, Ohio, is being held in an Israeli jail pending review
of the deportation order by Israel's supreme court.
   A native of Jerusalem, Awad was arrested May 5 following
government allegations that he had done much to incite the
five-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Ms. Nye said her husband is a moderate who believes that Israel
and Palestine should exist in side-by-side states and that
Palestinians should resist the military occupation of Israel
through non-violent methods.
   She said the court's decision, expected shortly after it hears
the case next Monday, will determine whether Christian and Moslem
residents of Jerusalem can have their residency rights lifted and
be asked to leave their homeland.
   Ms. Nye released copies of a letter she received from her
husband last Sunday. In the letter, Awad said he is willing to
accept the state of Israel and that Palestinians have been using
civil disobedience and non-violent action to deliver a message to
the Israelis and the world.
   ``Let not this chance be gone,'' Awad wrote. ``Don't force us
again to kill.''
   Ms. Nye said she believes Awad meant that many Palestinians have
had to discipline themselves in using non-violent means to send the
message that they are tired of living under military occupation.
   ``But he also understands that a long struggle that seems to be
falling on deaf ears will produce a frustration,'' she said. ``And
I think he fears that that frustration will lead to violence.''

   The nephew of the late entertainer Liberace
was ordered to a state mental hospital Wednesday for stabbing his
sister during an argument.
   Lester Lee Liberace, 33, was ordered to Patton State Hospital in
San Bernardino County for a maximum term of seven years by Superior
Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz.
   Liberace pleaded guilty in February to assault with a deadly
weapon in exchange for dismissal of an attempted murder charge.
Under terms of the plea bargain, prosecutors recommended
committment to a state mental hospital for seven years, or until he
was no longer considered a threat to society.
   Liberace stabbed his sister, Ina Liberace, 28, in the stomach
with an 8-inch kitchen knife on Nov. 6.
   He had asked her to take him back to the Chatsworth
Rehabilitation Center, which he had left the day before. He became
impatient and assaulted her, prosecutors said.
   Liberace is the son of the late Rudy Liberace, brother of the
flamboyant pianist who died of complications of AIDS last year.

<TEXT>
   The Georgia Republican Party's credentials
committee has ousted about 800 of the 2,301 delegates from this
weekend's state convention in Albany.
   Richmond County party chairman Larry Colet, whose 63-member
delegation was one of at least 40 county delegations thrown out for
technical reasons, said Tuesday that attorneys for the rejected
delegates may challenge the committee's credentialing authority.
   Colet and other members of his delegation said the committee's
action is a continuation of a months-long battle between party
regulars who want a full slate of George Bush delegates and
counties that allowed Pat Robertson supporters into their
delegations to the state convention.
   The Richmond County group included 38 Robertson supporters and
25 Bush supporters.
   ``It's dumb,'' said state Sen. Frank Albert, a member of the
rejected delegation. ``I'm a Bush supporter, but there are a lot of
people like myself who are disgusted.''
   ``I think they're going to keep us off the floor altogether. We
can sit up in the balcony and throw stuff at 'em.''

<HEAD>Sikh Militants Surrender, Ending Siege</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh radicals surrendered after a 10-day
siege and emerged Wednesday from their revered Golden Temple,
symbol of the dream of an independent nation that propels their
campaign of blood and terror.
   Forty-five men and a woman emerged, hands in the air or clasped
on their heads. About 2,800 police, commandos and paramilitary
troops surrounded the sacred compound, which has walls 20 feet high
and covers the equivalent of five city blocks.
   ``No terrorist is inside the complex,'' said K.P.S. Gill, police
chief of Punjab state. ``All of them have come out.''
   The militants crossed an 8-foot-wide white marble walkway that
provides the only access to the 400-year-old shrine, which sits in
a vast pool where pilgrims bathe in peaceful times. The surrender
took 45 minutes.
   Gill said one radical tried to flee and was shot dead, and three
committed suicide by swallowing cyanide capsules. Another committed
suicide by the same method Sunday.
   Officials say 42 people, most of them militant Sikhs, were
killed during the siege, bringing the death toll to 46 with the
suicides.
   The Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest site, has been the center
and symbol of Sikh militancy since the separatists began their
terrorist war in 1982.
   Thousands of people have been killed and Wednesday's surrender
does not end their struggle for a Sikh nation in this rich northern
agricultural state. It would be called Khalistan, or Land of the
Pure.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, the only Indian state in which Sikhs are a
majority, Sikh gunmen killed at least 40 people Tuesday and
Wednesday. The victims included 31 itinerant Hindu laborers who
were attacked in their tents late Tuesday night near a canal they
were building near Majjat, a village 120 miles southeast of
Amritsar.
   Militants say Sikhs need a separate homeland to preserve their
faith and avoid discrimination by Hindus.
   They have killed at least 1,063 people in Punjab so far this
year, including entire families. The death toll from their
terrorism in all of 1987 was 1,032.
   Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism
and Islam. Only 2 percent of India's 800 million people are Sikhs
and 82 percent are Hindus.
   Commandos searched everyone who emerged from the gold-domed
temple Wednesday, even to the point of removing turbans and
unwrapping the yards of fabric that form the traditional headgear
of devout male Sikhs.
   Prisoners were taken to a tin shed, where Red Cross workers gave
them food and water.
   Five bodies were found inside the complex, one identified as
that of Jagir Singh, spokesman for the Panthic Committee, umbrella
group for a dozen separatist groups.
   It was partially burned but there was no word on the cause of
death. Another body, of a woman, was found in the sacred pool.
   During the cease-fire and subsequent surrender, crowds gathered
300 yards from the temple compound. That was as close as they could
get to the shrine, whose immediately vicinity has been sealed off
since the siege began May 9 in Amritsar, a city of 800,000 people.
   ``This is a day of great relief,'' Punjab governor Sidharth
Shankar Ray said Wednesday night, but added: ``It is neither
victory nor defeat.''
   He urged Sikh militants throughout Punjab to turn themselves in
at the nearest police stations and said the temple would be
restored to its religious function as soon as possible.
   Government forces had been careful to avoid storming the temple.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered an army assault against
Sikh gunmen in the complex in 1984 in which more than 1,200 people
were killed. Less than five months later, on Oct. 31, two of her
Sikh bodyguards assassinated Mrs. Gandhi.
   Her son and successor, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, said
Wednesday night no one should be allowed to carry arms in the
Golden Temple.
   In his first public statement after the siege ended, he said in
New Delhi he believes most Sikhs in India supported it.
   Sikh militants usually complain of discrimination in general
terms, but one specific complaint is the allegation that Gandhi's
government has tried to weaken Punjab's economy by diverting river
water needed for its agriculture to other states.
   Because of the terror campaign, security officials outside
Punjab scrutinize Sikhs more closely at checkpoints and during
times of crisis. Since devout Sikhs wear turbans, moustaches and
untrimmed beards, they are instantly distinguishable.

   Police in a helicopter plucked two fishermen
from the Arkansas River _ and then ticketed them for being there.
   A third fisherman waded to safety Tuesday, but did not avoid a
ticket for violating a city ordinance that makes it illegal to swim
or wade in the Zink Lake or low-water dam area, Cpl. G.L. Temple
said.
   Michael Levasseur, 30, said he and two other men waded out about
300 feet.
   Police yelled at them from a pedestrian bridge about six hours
later to get out. The three had planned to wait for the rising
water to recede before leaving, he said.
   ``We just looked at each other and said, `I hope you can
swim,''' said Levasseur, who waded to shore.
   They were loaded down with fishing tackle and their catch.
   ``I just thought, `These fish ain't worth dying over,' so I let
them go,'' Levasseur said.
   Pat Arrington, 27, said he had 20 to 30 pounds of fish strung
around his neck as well as a tackle box. ``The current pulling on
the fish was pulling me down _ I had to lose all my stuff just to
stay alive,'' he said.
   The men were treated for exhaustion once they reached shore.
   The third fisherman was identified as Steve Arrington, 30.
   Of the tickets, which carry a fine up to $500, Officer T.J.
Gresham said, ``We want people to understand how dangerous it is to
be out there.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Red Sox have refused to cover a
billboard advertising cigarettes during a charity game to raise
money to fight children's cancer despite complaints by an
anti-smoking group.
   The Boston-based Group Against Smoking Pollution, or GASP, asked
the ballclub to cover a billboard in center field promoting
Marlboro cigarettes during an exhibition game to be played Thursday
between the Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds to benefit cancer research.
   Red Sox management said the billboard, which has an illustration
of a cowboy, could not be covered because of a long-term contract
the team has with the Philip Morris tobacco company.
   ``The Red Sox have entered into a contract that is legally
binding,'' team counsel John Donovan said Wednesday. ``I intend to
honor my contracts.''
   GASP Executive Director Jerry Maldavir said he believes the Red
Sox are sending mixed messages to children by displaying the
billboard.
   ``Since Thursday night's game is for children who have cancer,
the Red Sox should do something to dispel the connection between
smoking and baseball,'' he said.
   Donovan refused to comment on the image projected by the
cigarette ad, but said the team has raised millions of dollars for
the local children's cancer group known as the Jimmy Fund in the
past and will continue to support the charity.
   Steven Weiss, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said he had no
immediate comment on the dispute.
   Mike Andrews, executive director of fund raising for the Jimmy
Fund, said although he does not think attacking the Red Sox is
fair, he could not fault the anti-smoking group for trying. GASP
has been trying for six years to get the ballclub to drop the
tobacco advertisements.
   ``If anything, I think all tobacco advertising, smoking or
smokeless, should be banned, as should smoking itself. Tobacco is a
drug,'' Andrews said.
   ``Kids idolize and emulate sports figures,'' Maldavir said.
``When they see the billboard on television or at the ballpark,
they think baseball and smoking go hand in hand.
   ``The Red Sox project this attractiveness that says, `Wear what
I wear, smoke what I smoke.'''
   In light of the U.S. surgeon general's recent report that
concludes nicotine found in tobacco is as addictive as drugs,
Maldavir said, his group's request is even more urgent.
   ``In 1971, advertising of tobacco products was banned on
television, but every time the TV cameras go across the scoreboard,
there it is,'' Maldavir said.

<HEAD>Report Western Publications to be Sold in Soviet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have lifted restrictions on the sale of
American and West European newspapers and magazines and they will
be sold in ordinary press kiosks in the future, the weekly Moscow
News reported Wednesday.
   Viktor Pukalov, head of the Soyuzpechat agency that distributes
Soviet and foreign periodicals, told Moscow News ``the first step
toward extending the sales of Western newspapers and magazines was
the decision to open access to these publications to the general
public.''
   The newspaper did not make clear when the publications would
appear.
   The article specifically mentioned the Times of London, the
International Herald Tribune, Newsweek and the Economist as
examples of Western publications that will be available in Soviet
kiosks.
   Pukalov acknowledged that another barrier to broader circulation
_ the non-convertible ruble _ has not been surmounted.
   Soviet hard-currency reserves are limited, and therefore the
government spends its dollars, pounds and other convertible funds
on priority items like grain and high-technology equipment for
boosting factory output.
   ``I think that our Western partners will be interested in an
exchange of publications,'' Pukalov told the newspaper. ``Interest
in our press is growing along with the interest in our country: for
the first time the single number of export copies of Soviet
newspapers and magazines reached 12.5 million copies.''
   Pukalov said 160,000 issues of publications from 46 foreign
countries reach Moscow each day, but indicated that most go to
hotels frequented by foreigners or to press and foreign trade
offices that need to know what is carried in those publications.
   Western publications are more expensive than Soviet newspapers,
which usually sell for 3 to 5 kopeks (5 to 8 cents), and the price
to Soviet customers would have to be even higher to recover the
cost and transport, the newspaper said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate was still trying to work its way
out of a legislative snarl Wednesday which has blocked final action
on a Pentagon budget bill, while the House voted overwhelming
passage of a military construction measure.
   ``We're trying to work out some type of agreement, but we don't
have one yet. I don't know when it will be done,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The dispute involves an amendment that would allow drug dealers
convicted of killing people to be sentenced to death.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., sponsor of the amendment, has
refused to withdraw the proposal and opponents have threatened a
filibuster to block a final vote on the provision.
   D'Amato has offered to drop the amendment if Democratic leaders
promise that it will come before the chamber later for a separate
vote, but opponents have not dropped filibuster threats.
   ``I am not willing to let this go until we can be assured of a
vote,'' D'Amato said Wednesday afternoon.
   The amendment is the only unresolved issue in the huge Pentagon
budget bill. Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, has pushed for final action by the Democratic-controlled
chamber.
   Approval by the Senate would send the bill to a conference
committee to be reconciled with the separate Pentagon spending
measure passed a week ago by the House.
   Both bills authorize defense spending of $299.5 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but contain a number of differences
over issues such as arms control, the Star Wars budget, and
ordering the military into the fight against drugs.
   Meanwhile, the House voted 382-26 passage of a bill
appropriating $9 billion for a variety of military construction
programs for the next fiscal year. The Senate has yet to act on its
version of the same measure.
   The bill is different from the authorization legislation, which
allows the Pentagon to go ahead and sign contracts. Appropriation
bills are considered later.
   The House measure includes $77.5 million for the first
construction of hangars at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri for
the ``stealth'' bomber.
   The plane, known formally as the B-2, is designed to evade
Soviet radar. The Air Force plans to begin deploying it early in
the next decade. The first stealth bombers will be based at
Whiteman.

   Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker said
Wednesday that Attorney General Edwin Meese III is ``a son of a
bitch'' that he doesn't like, but stopped short of saying Meese
should resign.
   Connecticut's other senator, Democrat Christopher Dodd, said
Meese should step down. In taking that position, Dodd said he had
voted against Meese's confirmation in the first place and merely
was being consistent.
   The two lawmakers were guests of President Reagan on Air Force
One en route to New London, Conn., where Reagan delivered the
commencement address at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
   Weicker and Dodd made their comments separately, talking with
reporters in the rear cabin of the presidential jet about Reagan's
longtime friend while the president was in his cabin at the front
of the aircraft. A reporter reminded Weicker that his comments were
on the record.
   Weicker, a frequent critic of administration policies who is
seeking a fourth term in office this fall, expressed surprise that
he had been invited aboard Air Force One.
   Meese has been been the target of a criminal investigation by
independent counsel James McKay of possible conflict of interest.
There have been repeated calls for Meese's resignation. When a
reporter asked Weicker if Meese should step down, he said, ``I've
been battling the son of a bitch ever since he became attorney
general. I don't like him.''
   However, Weicker said, ``I want to see the report of the special
prosecutor (McKay)'' before saying whether Meese should leave.
   Later, as Reagan toured a Coast Guard cutter in New London,
television reporters tried to get Weicker to repeat his assessment
of Meese on camera. He said merely that he wanted to see the
special prosecutor's report.
   When pressed on the issue by ABC-TV correspondent Sam Donaldson,
Weicker playfully thrust his hand behind the cameras and raised his
middle finger in the reporter's face.
   Reagan often invites members of Congress to accompany him on
trips to their states and districts as a matter of presidential
courtesy.
   Reagan, eating lunch with members of the cutter's crew, was
asked by a reporter about conservatives' unhappiness over Meese's
firing of Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   ``I think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him
(Meese),'' Reagan replied. ``So far, they're all empty charges.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Launch Investigation Of Alleged Jewish Funds
Embezzlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors launched an
investigation Wednesday into allegations the late head of West
Germany's Jewish community embezzled millions of dollars of
government money earmarked for Holocaust survivors.
   Prosecutors also said others may have been involved in the
embezzling scheme apparently led by Werner Nachmann, who headed the
Central Jewish Council for 23 years until his death in January.
   Jewish leaders said they would launch their own inquiry.
   ``We need a wide-ranging explanation, we must get to the bottom
of this,'' a Jewish leader in Frankfurt, Ignatz Bubis, told Hesse
State radio.
   ``We will use all legal means at our disposal to take action
against everyone who took part in this,'' said Michael Fuerst, a
Hanover Jewish leader.
   Manfred Roething, a spokesman for the Karlsruhe prosecutor's
office, said investigators would seek to determine ``whether other
parties may be liable for prosecution as accessories.''
   In Bonn, the allegations were discussed at the regular Wednesday
meeting of the Cabinet, said government spokesman Friedhelm Ost.
   Heinz Galinski, Nachmann's successor as head of the Jewish
community, said he would meet with a Kohl aide, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
on Friday to discuss the case.
   Eberhard Braun, a court-appointed investigator who has been
examining Nachmann's financial records, told The Associated Press
that he had found unexplained income of $13 million in Nachmann's
company records.
   Peter Paepcke, the Nachmann family attorney, said he believes
Nachmann may have embezzled up to $15 million and used it to
bolster his failing wholesale textile and raw materials company.
   ``I had hoped in going through the records to find some cause
for why this (the embezzlement) happened, even a political cause,
but I couldn't find anything like that,'' he said in an interview.
   Paepcke said he filed for bankruptcy March 30 for Nachmann's
heirs and his Karlsruhe-based company. He did not provide further
details about a diversion of funds.
   Nachmann, president of the Jewish Council from 1965 until his
death at age 62, was in charge of disbursing government funds to
Holocaust survivors around the world.
   About $236 million was allocated by the government in 1980 for
Holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations claims.
   On Tuesday, Galinski said the Jewish Council had asked a civil
court to freeze the assets of Nachmann's estate.
   He said Nachmann appears to have embezzled about $6 million but
said other reported figures were speculation.
   Galinski said he first heard of the allegations April 10, but he
declined to give further details.
   Nachmann had been active in trying to help heal wounds in West
Germany left by the Holocaust, in which about 6 million Jews were
killed during Nazi rule.
   Nachmann's family fled Nazi Germany to France in 1938. He
returned to Karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward
re-establishing Jewish communities in the country.
   About 530,000 Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in
1933. West Germany has about 30,000 Jewish residents today.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Association Approves Hiring of Non-Smokers Only</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county Sheriff's Association
overwhelmingly ratified a new contract that would ban the hiring of
smokers.
   The provision does not apply to smokers already employed by the
department, said Ron Komers, director of the Ventura County
Personnel Department.
   The 550-member association, made up of sheriff's deputies,
sergeants and investigators, voted by a 9-1 ratio last week in
favor of the two-year contract. The county Board of Supervisors is
expected to give its final approval next week.
   Under the plan, new employees would be required to sign an
agreement stating they will not smoke, he said. Violators could be
fired.
   No law enforcement agency in California and only a few across
the nation have such a policy, officials said.
   County spokeswoman Lucy Crockett said the contract was modeled
on one instituted by Alexandria, Va., police 11 years ago. That
policy, however, was rescinded in 1986 and replaced with one that
allows smoking in designated areas because the department had
``trouble with enforcement,'' she said.
   The measure is intended to reduce health-care and pension costs,
which, statistics show, can range up to $5,000 more per year for a
smoker than for a non-smoker, Komers said.

   Jesse Jackson met Wednesday with Jewish
leaders in what he described as ``a step toward healing the
wounds'' and the beginning of in-depth dialogue with Jewish critics
of his Democratic presidential candidacy.
   A few in the group endorsed him.
   Jackson said after the 90-minute private meeting with a dozen
Los Angeles area rabbis and about 20 other Jewish leaders that he
would have a similar meeting in New York next month _ after
California's June 7 presidential primary.
   His campaign has been troubled by opposition from Jewish voters,
due in part to his 1979 meeting with Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, his reference in 1984 to New
York as ``Hymietown'' and his past relationship to Louis Farrakhan,
who has made anti-Jewish statements.
   While about a dozen demonstrators outside Jackson's Hollywood
hotel chanted ``Lose, Jesse, lose,'' ``Jew hater'' and ``Jesse, get
out of town,'' Jackson and about half of the participants in the
closed session praised each other at a joint news conference.
   Jackson described the session as ``a step toward healing the
wounds,'' adding that ``We do live in one global community. ... We
walk together.''
   Rabbi Allen Freehling said that ``the litany of complaints in
the Jewish community with Jesse Jackson has been articulated'' and
that there was ``a reconciliation.''
   ``We are as Jews and blacks united in one respect: We have a
common commitment to justice,'' said Rabbi Leonard Beerman, one of
the few participants in the session to say he was endorsing Jackson.
   Asked by reporters why he didn't have a similar meeting while
campaigning in New York last month, Jackson cited verbal attacks
against him by Edward Koch, New York City's Jewish mayor, and said,
``Here you have a climate that is more conducive'' to healing his
differences with Jewish voters. ``We thought this was the right
place to start.''
   Koch had said during the New York primary campaign that Jewish
voters concerned about the fate of Israel would have to be crazy to
vote for Jackson.
   Jackson said on Wednesday, ``I met with Arafat. So did the pope.
We took him not arms. ... We took to him an appeal for reason, for
justice.''
   On another subject, Jackson said he would not let death threats
deter his campaign.
   Asked if he was changing anything because of the arrests Tuesday
of a St. Louis couple accused of conspiring to harm or kill him,
Jackson replied, ``No, we are not. We know that those who will do
peace must face the hostility of those who are bound to fear.
   ``We will not surrender to the dream-busters. The Secret Service
will handle the dream-busters,'' he said, praising the federal
agents protecting him and other presidential candidates.
   Security spokesmen declined comment on whether Jackson's
security had been increased, but there were no signs of any
significant change in their procedures.
   On politics, Jackson said he was not discouraged by polls
indicating he is trailing Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by
more than 30 percentage points in California.
   ``All my life has been an uphill battle. We will not
surrender,'' Jackson said.
   Earlier, Jackson had said that the results of the Oregon
primary, where Dukakis defeated him handily, would still give his
campaign a boost in California because his Oregon showing was
better than 1984.
   ``We look forward to California, New Jersey, New Mexico and
Montana as our base of support continues to expand. I'm very
encouraged,'' Jackson said.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis insisted Wednesday that he has not begun looking for a
running mate but said he hoped to choose one before the Democratic
National Convention in July.
   ``Nobody is heading my search for a running mate,'' Dukakis
said. ``The search for a running mate will not begin until the 8th
of June,'' the day after the final primaries.
   The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Dukakis campaign
chairman Paul Brountas was heading the search.
   ``I haven't made that decision,'' Dukakis told a Statehouse news
conference. ``But it will be a thoughtful, and I hope successful,
search.''
   Several Dukakis aides, speaking privately, said they were aware
of no formal search for a running mate but that they expected
Brountas, a law school classmate and close friend of the governor,
to head the effort.
   With prospects of a convention battle with Jackson, Dukakis was
asked if he hoped to choose a running mate before then.
   ``Most nominees do,'' he said. ``If I'm the nominee I would hope
that decision will be made before the convention, sure, or at least
the recommendations.''
   The Massachusetts governor also brushed off the latest challenge
of delegate selection rules from rival Jesse Jackson, whose
campaign on Wednesday said it sent Dukakis a letter indicating
Jackson planned a convention challenge to delegate rules.
   Jackson has been complaining recently that Dukakis has unfairly
been getting the support of the majority of ``super delegates,''
elected officials and party leaders who automatically are
convention delegates.
   ``I don't think we are going to have a fight with Mr. Jackson,''
he said.
   ``I think Jesse has a perfect right to voice criticism of
whatever he chooses to criticize,'' he said, before repeating his
position that Jackson knew the delegate selection rules when he
entered the race.
   Dukakis was leaving Massachusetts Wednesday night for
appearances in New York and New Jersey. He was to attend several
events Thursday morning in New Jersey before heading to California
for several days of campaigning there. California and New Jersey
hold primaries June 7.
   Dukakis held the news conference to announce an executive order
expanding state use of recycled products and banning the state from
purchasing non-recyclable polystyrene products, which have been
linked to damaging the ozone layer.

<HEAD>Wildlife Group Thwarted in Latest Bid to Block Opening of Panda
Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has turned down a request for
an expedited hearing by a wildlife group, clearing the way for the
Toledo Zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas from China,
officials said Wednesday.
   Kenneth Cook, press director of the World Wildlife Fund, said he
had hoped a hearing could be held in U.S. District Court this week
on the group's motion to bar the exhibit, which is scheduled to
open next Tuesday.
   But Cook said Judge Norma Johnson could not schedule a hearing
that soon and asked the parties to file additional briefs in the
case.
   ``I think it happens when the court gets jammed,'' said Cook.
``We're disappointed. We're stuck.''
   But he said the wildlife fund intends to continue its fight and
plans to file its brief on Friday. He said he presumes a hearing
will be set after the reply briefs are filed.
   Ellen Efros, lawyer for the zoo, said rules require that a reply
brief be filed within five working days of the wildlife fund's
filing. She said the judge's decision clears the way for the
exhibit to open.
   Last week Judge Johnson refused to grant a temporary restraining
order sought by the group to prevent the pandas from being shipped
to Toledo from Shanghai.
   The pandas are scheduled to spend at least 100 days at the zoo,
which has spent nearly $3 million preparing for their visit.
   In their suit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
wildlife fund argued that exhibition of the pandas violates an
international convention that prohibits trafficking in endangered
species for commercial purposes.
   The group says the exhibition would increase the demand for such
transactions from other zoos and hurt the effort to breed pandas.

   NBC will devote an hour to prime-time news this
summer, and if the strike by the Writers Guild of America doesn't
end by midsummer, prime-time news could be part of the fall lineup,
NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff said Wednesday.
   Tartikoff told reporters in a satellite news conference that NBC
plans to put news specials and a potential series with Connie Chung
into the Tuesday 10 p.m. EDT time period by the end of June.
   NBC has not had a prime-time news show since ``1986'' was
canceled a year and a half ago. CBS has three prime-time news
hours: ``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th.'' ABC has
``20@20.''
   NBC has scored in the ratings this season with lifestyle
documentaries like Chung's ``Life in the Fat Lane'' and Maria
Shriver's ``Women in Prison.''
   NBC starts the season with prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics, but Tartikoff said if the writers' strike continues
through the summer, it could delay the start of NBC's series. A
news show, unaffected by the strike, he said, ``may continue out of
that crisis the way (ABC's) `Nightline' continued out of the Iran
hostage crisis.''
   NBC's news writers are members of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians rather than of the Writer's
Guild.

<TEXT>
   Bands, banners and a cheering crowd on
Wednesday greeted the first Soviet soldiers to cross the border in
the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``The soldiers are leaving, but friendship with the Soviet Union
stays,'' the Afghan defense minister, Mohammad Rafie, told a rally
in this border town. ``And it will keep developing and growing even
stronger.'' His comments were reported by the Soviet news agency
Tass.
   Nikolai Novikov, 21, was the first Soviet soldier to cross the
bridge over the river Amu-Darya that forms the border between
Afghanistan and Soviet Uzbekistan. He was riding on a flower-decked
armored personnel carrier.
   Behind him followed 228 vehicles and about 1,300 soldiers of his
motor rifle unit.
   The convoy was the first significant withdrawal of Soviet forces
under a U.N.-sponsored peace accord that calls for the Kremlin to
remove all of its estimated 115,000 soldiers within nine months.
   The Kremlin sent soldiers over the border into Afghanistan in
December 1979. They replaced one pro-Soviet government with another
and stayed to help fight U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents.
   Tass said Col. Yuri Starov, unit commander, told a rally: ``Our
officers and men have done all they could for peace on Afghan
soil.''
   ``Our best comrades have not laid down their lives there in
vain,'' he said. ``Afghanistan remains free and independent.''
   Rafie said that as a result of Soviet aid, ``Children are going
to school, peasants are cultivating land and workers are operating
their lathes.''
   ``You have helped us to create a battleworthy people's army
which can independently fulfill any assignment to protect the
fatherland,'' he said.
   Reporters flown to Termez saw troops cross the ``Bridge of
Friendship'' from the Afghan village of Khairaton.
   Information about the Soviet withdrawal has been relayed from
Kabul by a Reuters news agency pool report.
   The Associated Press was denied permission to travel to
Afghanistan for the pullout. A Soviet Foreign Ministry official
said recently the exclusion was the result of ``inappropriate
questions'' asked during a previous visit by AP.
   Tass said a band played a march as the convoy crossed the river,
and motorists honked their car horns. The military vehicles honked
their horns in reply.
   Most of the Soviet troops in the initial withdrawal convoy had
left their base in Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, early
Sunday.
   The most dangerous stretches of the three-day journey of the
convoy from Kabul to Termez had been expected to be a gorge north
of the capital and the Salang tunnel, in the Hindu Kush mountains,
overrun with rebels.
   But Col. Grigory Bondarev, a senior officer with the convoy,
said there were no major incidents on the journey from Jalalabad,
west to the capital Kabul and north to the Soviet border.
   ``All who left Jalalabad arrived safe and healthy,'' he said.
``I can tell you officially that there was no shooting from
Jalalabad to Kabul and from Kabul to Khairaton.''
   But Soviet TV on Tuesday night showed a correspondent with the
convoy while rifle fire crackled around him. The reporter did not
give his location.
   The Geneva accord was signed last month by Pakistan and
Afghanistan with the Soviet Union and United States as guarantors.
The fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas did not participate in the
negotiations or sign the pact.

   Thomas E. Stephens, who was appointments
secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower during his two terms,
has died. He was 84.
   Stephens died Sunday at Morton Plant Hospital.
   Born in Ireland, Stephens obtained law degrees from Brooklyn Law
School and St. Lawrence College, said Herb Pankratz, a researcher
for the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan.
   Stephens was affiliated with the New York law firm of Lord, Day
and Lord during the 1930s. In 1938, he was an administrative
assistant to Newbold Morris, then president of the City Council.
   He became active in the Republican Party during the 1940s,
serving at one time as the party's director of campaign development.
   In 1949, Stephens took his first job in Washington, D.C., as
administrative assistant to Sen. John Foster Dulles, who became
Secretary of State under Eisenhower. Stephens became Eisenhower's
appointments secretary in 1952.
   Stephens moved to Clearwater in 1973.
   He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Mary. No funeral was
planned.

   Former Anheuser-Busch Chairman August
A. Busch recevied a late birthday present from his son, who said he
had trouble figuring out what to get the man who has everything.
   So Peter Busch, a local beer distributor, found the perfect gift
_ an artifical reef.
   The younger Busch donated $10,000 to St. Lucie County's
artificial reef program Tuesday and asked that the reef be named
for his father, president of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team,
who turned 89 in March. Commissioners agreed and Busch said his
father was overjoyed with his present.
   ``It's kind of tough to give something to a man who has
everything after 89 years,'' he said. ``He's thrilled about having
the reef named for him.''
   Busch said he hopes the donation will spur others to contribute
the $50,000 needed to bring the USS Muliphen, a World War II cargo
ship, to Fort Pierce from Newport News, Va. The Muliphen would be
sunk on the artificial reef 15 miles off the Fort Pierce Inlet.

   Fathers who are on the road a lot have to work
extra hard to maintain good relations with their children, say
actor-singer Kris Kristofferson and ball player Willie Randolph,
two of eight men honored Wednesday by the National Father's Day
Committee.
   Kristofferson, who has six children by three wives and three
adopted Salvadoran orphans, said he felt ``totally unqualified'' to
be named one of the 1988 fathers of the year.
   ``I had the good taste to select mothers who would raise them,''
he said, ``all I've done is love them.''
   Apparently love was enough, because all nine children now live
with him and his current wife, Lisa, at their Malibu, Calif., home.
   ``It's a great pleasure for me that all of them have come back
and are living with me, even the 26-year-old,'' Kristofferson said.
   Randolph, the New York Yankee second baseman who spends half the

   He started the family rap sessions about four years ago to try

<HEAD>Names of Three Roman Catholic Bishops Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities released the names
Wednesday of two auxiliary Roman Catholic bishops and an apostolic
administrator who will be appointed in June, state radio reported.
   The two auxiliaries, to serve in Prague, were identified as Jan
Lebeda, now vicar general, and Antonin Liska. They will assist
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the 88-year-old archbishop of Prague
and Czechoslovakia's Catholic primate.
   Jan Sokol, the third appointee, will be apostolic administrator
for the archdiocese of Trnava in Slovakia.
   Keston College, a London-based organization that monitors
religious life in the Soviet bloc, said none of the new three
belongs to Pacem in Terris, a government-sponsored clergy
organization the Vatican does not recognize.
   An apostolic administrator is considered a ``titular bishop,''
ranking below a full resident bishop.
   Church sources in Prague had mentioned the same names earlier
this week. Lengthy negotiations between the government and a
Vatican delegation preceded the appointments.
   Ten of Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses still lack full bishops and
the three serving bishops are over age 75. No new Czechoslovak
bishops have been appointed since 1973.

<HEAD>Economic Reform Delayed Again Due To Lack Of Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's latest economic
reforms, scheduled to start May 15, will be postponed until June
because of lack of emergency credits from the West, the state
Tanjug news agency said Wednesday.
   The reform package is aimed at curbing Yugoslavia's 170 percent
inflation rate, Europe's highest, by removing price controls,
liberalizing imports and instituting a foreign exchange market.
   Yugoslavia's six-month partial wage and price freeze, insituted
last fall, was prolonged earlier this month after the government
announced it had failed to secure about $300 million in emergency
loans.
   Yugoslavia must secure the credits in order to receive an
expected $1.4 billion in new loans from the International Monetary
Fund, Western governments and banks, to finance the country's $20
billion foreign debt.
   The new economic program will be delayed for another 10 to 15
days, or until until the initial credits became available to the
National Bank of Yugoslavia, according to the agency.
   Tanjug said Yugoslavia is expected to secure the short-term loan
from the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements only after
a stand-by arrangement for the new loans is approved by the
International Monetary Fund.
   The IMF Board of Directors is scheduled to meet before early
June, when the new Yugoslav economic measures are expected to be
introduced.

<HEAD>France Restores Diplomatic Ties With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France will re-establish diplomatic relations with
Iran, fulfilling a deal that led to this month's release of three
French hostages in Lebanon, Premier Michel Rocard announced
Wednesday.
   ``France gave its word. It will be kept,'' Rocard told reporters
after the weekly Cabinet meeting.
   The last three French hostages held by pro-Iranian Moslem
Shiites in Lebanon were freed four days before the May 8
presidential election, in which Premier Jacques Chirac, a
conservative, lost to Socialist President Francois Mitterrand.
   Chirac resigned after his defeat, and Mitterrand appointed
Rocard, also a Socialist, as premier.
   Rocard said that the new government found no written record of
the deal to free diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine and
journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann.
   Media reports speculated that France had made a deal with Iran
as a condition for the release, including the payment of a ransom.
Chirac had said Iran's intervention on behalf of the captive
Frenchmen would make possible a return to normal diplomatic
relations.
   Iran has long said it had influence over groups holding Western
hostages, but told France that improved relations were needed for
the hostages to benefit.
   But Chirac's statement about re-establishing ties has been the
only public reference to any possible exchange in return for the
hostages.
   The hostages, the last Frenchmen held by pro-Iranians, were
freed following lengthy negotiations headed by then-Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua. Pasqua denied any ransom was paid.
   Speculation centers on France's repayment to Iran of a $1
billion loan for the financing of a nuclear concern, Eurodif.
   Rocard said the return to normal relations would create a
``better climate'' for commercial negotiations with Iran, such as
the final settlement of the Eurodif debt.
   ``My government and the president do not intend to pass judgment
on the conditions under which these negotiations took place,''
Rocard said, making an apparent reference to the timing of the
releases, largely construed here as an electoral ploy.
   The two countries broke diplomatic ties July 17 in events
leading up to the last hostage release. Iranian Embassy officials
in Paris refused to let French authorities question Walid Gordji,
an embassy translator suspected of involvement with terrorism.
Police surrounded the embassy.
   In turn, Iranian troops sealed off the French Embassy in Tehran.
France said Iran had effectively severed relations.
   Gordji was allowed to leave France two days after the return of
two French in November.
   Mitterrand took personal responsibility for the move to
re-establish ties, announcing the start of the process at the
Cabinet meeting, the first regular one since his re-election.
   Ten French hostages were freed from Lebanon in the two years
that Chirac's government was in power. One hostage, Middle East
researcher Michel Seurat, died in capitivity.
   Eighteen foreigners, nine of them Americans, were kidnapped in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   A private foundation gave $10,000 awards
Wednesday to three people who lost their jobs after alleging
wrongdoing by their employers.
   The Cavallo Foundation, set up by Massachusetts money manager
Michael Cavallo, gave its first annual awards to a fired shipyard
inspector, a former Census Bureau worker and an ex-Veterans
Administration employee.
   The awards, presented by Cavallo at a news conference, came on
the eve of a Senate committee vote on a bill that would protect
government employees who disclose abuses. The bill would restrict
the Office of the Special Counsel from acting against
whistleblowers who complain that the agency often ends up
investigating them when they file complaints.
   The Governmental Affairs Committee is to take up the bill, which
would also give additional judicial protection to whistelblowers,
on Thursday.
   ``They probably thought I was a nitpicker and a busybody, but I
didn't care,'' said Leon Bard, 34, who was fired in 1986 as a
quality inspector at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, after he
disclosed that uninspected steel was being used in the construction
of Ticonderoga-class Navy cruisers.
   The company has denied that it used uninspected materials in its
shipbuilding. Bard, who is suing to get his job back, said he now
does seasonal excavation work and odd jobs in Bath.
   John Barter, 39, said he was fired as security chief at the
Cincinnati Veterans Administration Medical Center for reporting
alleged brutality to patients by a VA police chief.
   ``I hope my suffering will lead to real free speech rights for
other employees,'' said Barter, who works part-time for a halfway
house in Cincinnati but said he has been unable to find a full-time
job since he was fired.
   The other award winner, Billie Pirner Garde, 35, got a law
degree after she was fired for speaking out eight years ago against
corruption and sexual harassment in the Muskogee, Okla., district
office of the Census Bureau. Now, she works in Appleton, Wis., with
the Government Accountability Project, defending whistleblowers in
the nuclear industry.
   She referred to whistleblowers' stories as ``bureaucratic
profiles in courage.''
   In addition to the annual awards, the foundation gave a special
award and $3,000 to long-time whistleblower A. Ernest Fitzgerald,
61, who has become well-known for disclosing corruption and
mismanagement in the Defense Department, where he has worked for 23
years.
   Fitzgerald praised Cavallo for setting up the awards, saying,
``I just hope you don't run out of money, because the other side
has lots more.''
   Cavallo, 35, who said he contributed $300,000 to set up the
foundation last year, described the award as a reward for people
``who risk their jobs and risk having their lives turned upside
down for doing the right thing.'
   He said the awardees were chosen by a panel from among 25 people
nominated by public interest groups, investigative reporters and
others.

   Although the lives of Arthur Vinal Jr. and
Edward Wanton are separated by nearly three centuries, their names
both appear on a lawsuit seeking to stop the construction of four
houses.
   One of Wanton's descendants has gone to to court seeking to
block Vinal's proposed building project until a more thorough
search is made for a 17th-century burial ground believed to contain
the remains of Wanton and other early Quaker colonists.
   A hearing is scheduled next week in Plymouth County Superior
Court on Sally Sanford's request for an injunction.
   Sanford, a New York musician and Wanton's
great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter, obtained a
temporary restraining order against the development Tuesday.
Historical burial grounds are protected by state law.
   But Vinal, himself a descendant of 17th century settlers, said
an extensive search was made and two old headstones were discovered
outside the site proposed for four single-family homes.
   ``I've read a lot of stories about the North River and knew
about the burial ground. That's why we looked around before we made
any plans,'' said Vinal.
   ``I'm convinced we will not be disturbing any burial site with
the four homes,'' he said.
   The town planning board last June approved construction of four
houses on 16 of the 80 acres owned by Vinal for about 20 years.
   ``We've done what is expected of a developer,'' said Vinal's
attorney, Peter Puciloski. ``The suit is simply without merit.''
   Sanford said Wanton fled the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the
mid-1600s and settled on the North River, where he worked as a
teacher, village leader and shipwright.
   He set aside land near his house where he and other Quakers were
buried. Quakers are a Christian sect founded in England about 1650
based on a rejection of violence.
   Sanford maintains the full 16 acres should be surveyed more
carefully. Her suit says Norwell planners did not consider
affidavits from long-time residents who said they had knowledge of
the location of the burial site.
   Sanford said she became interested in Wanton nine years ago when
researching family roots.

<HEAD>Pope's Nomination of Bishop Stirs Controversy in Swiss Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's nomination of a conservative
bishop has touched off a controversy that bares deep discontent
among Swiss Roman Catholics over what critics charge is a growing
assertion of Vatican dominance. Wolfgang Haas, 40, is to be
consecrated Sunday as auxiliary bishop in Switzerland's
second-largest diocese, Chur. The title of coadjutor bestowed on
him by the pontiff gives the prelate the automatic right to succeed
Bishop Johannes Vonderach, 72, as head of the Chur Diocese.
   The nomination of Haas, said to hold strongly conservative views
of the church's role in society, has drawn wide criticism in the
lay and religious press of Switzerland.
   The appointment is also being challenged as incompatible with a
special privilege the Vatican granted in 1948 to Chur's ``Cathedral
chapter'' of 24 leading priests, who have the right to elect their
bishop from among three candidates named by the pope.
   ``Catholics feel deeply hurt in their sense of justice,'' said
an editorial this week in Orientierung, a Zurich Roman Catholic
periodical. ``One has the impression that even in Rome, people and
institutions who are thoroughly willing to respect the cultural and
political peculiarities of a country were not consulted.''
   Switzerland is a cradle of Protestantism and the native land of
the Rev. Hans Kueng, a critic of the papacy.
   Reform-minded Catholics are also concerned that Haas'
conservatism will reduce the role of the many lay people who have
become active in parishes since the 1960s.
   Haas, 40, is said to have little sympathy for the increasingly
important role of women in the church in Switzerland.
   ``He has already refused to say Mass in the Chur cathedral
because a woman was supposed to deliver the homily,'' said
theologian Martha Brun.
   Last week, a petition signed by 267 of the Chur Diocese's 550
priests was handed to the representative of the pope in the capital
of Bern. It demanded that Haas renounce his appointment pending
clarification of the special rights of succession in the Chur
Diocese.
   ``The problem is that a vested right was bypassed,'' said the
Rev. Guido Kolb, a member of the Cathedral Chapter, who delivered
the petition to the capital. ``But the tendency in Rome is
centralist again, ignoring the privileges of thelocal churches.''
   Kolb said the non-signers included ``those who felt the petition
was too conciliatory and others who favor dropping the matter.''
   Haas has yet to react to the criticism. He has merely said he
``cannot and will not'' renounce his right of succession.
   But his consecration is not likely to end the debate.
   Theology students have staged protest demonstrations in Chur,
where 50 students mounted a 10-hour vigil in front of the
cathedral, and in the city of Fribourg, which has Switzerland's
largest Roman Catholic university. In Fribourg, a funeral cortege
accompanied a coffin marked ``Second Vatican Council'' _ a
reference to the program of reforms instituted in the 1960s to
modernize the church.

<HEAD>Suspended Doctors Rush To Catch Up On Patient Records For
Reinstatement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the 290 doctors suspended by
Tampa General Hospital for falling behind in paperwork rushed to
complete patient records Wednesday to win reinstatement, a
spokeswoman said.
   The list of suspensions, which affected admitting privileges
only, stood at 159 doctors by midday Wednesday, a day after it was
posted at the hospital, said Cindy Tanner, spokeswoman at the
hospital.
   Ms. Tanner said that since the hospital's large records section
is open around-the-clock, there has been no crush from doctors
scrambling to fill out forms.
   ``It has been a smooth process,'' she said.
   Of the 331 doctors warned in notices mailed Sunday, 41 complied
before Tuesday. The 290 suspensions represented about one-third of
the staff.
   ``It's no big deal,'' said Tom Clark, executive director of the
Hillsborough County Medical Association. ``Hospitals all over the
country do it.''
   Clark said he hadn't received many complaints from doctors. But
he said Tampa General let too many doctors fall behind with too
many records, causing a budget shortfall.
   Hospital President Newell France noted that patients and
insurance companies can't be billed and Medicare and Medicaid won't
pay until records are completed.
   Bills worth $5.5 million for patients discharged more than a
month ago have been held up because of the problem, France said,
causing a ``definite impact on cash flow.''
   In addition, France said, the Joint Commission on Accreditation
cited Tampa General in its January survey for allowing charts to
fall behind. It gave the hospital until June to get them in order.
   Dr. Edward Spoto, hospital chief of staff, said the number of
suspensions appeared to be ``extrordinary'' because the hospital
and medical staff are ``strictly enforcing staff rules and
regulations'' and a new physician-medical records information and
notification system has been installed.
   The system allows more frequent notification to physicians about
incomplete charts and records. The old system notified them once a
month, and gave the physicians 15 days to complete their charts, he
said.
   In an emezgency, emergency room physicians can admit a patient
even if the person's doctor is suspended. Non-emergency admissions
must wait until the physician is reinstated.

   Editors from The Washington Post and Newsweek
interviewed Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported that the interview took
place, and the evening television news program ``Vremya'' showed a
short film clip of Gorbachev meeting the U.S. journalists.
   Tass said the group included Washington Post Chairman Katharine
Graham; Newsweek Editor Richard Smith; and Washington Post editors
Jimmie Hoagland, Meg Greenfield and Robert Kaiser.
   No details of the interview were released, but the Soviet media
said it would be published in the Soviet press on Monday following
its publication in Sunday's editions of the Post and next week's
issues of Newsweek.
   Gorbachev granted the interview less than two weeks before
President Reagan arrives in Moscow for his fourth meeting with the
Soviet leader.
   Prior to traveling to Washington for their meeting in December,
Gorbachev granted an interview to NBC News.

<HEAD>FCC Exclusivity Ruling May Cut Into Reruns on Superstations, Cable</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: RECASTS lead to clarify; adds new detail, reaction throughout</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday approved rules that are likely to reduce how often TV
viewers will see reruns of shows like ``The Brady Bunch'' and ``I
Love Lucy.''
   The FCC, voting 3-0 to adopt the rules, said local TV stations
will be able to negotiate exclusive contracts for syndicated
programs. Cable TV systems that broadcast the same programs in a
local station's viewing area will have to black out the shows or
substitute other programs.
   Broadcasters welcomed the rules, but the cable industry
predicted an outcry from angry viewers and said it will challenge
the rules in court. Some critics say the rules could spell the end
of some so-called superstations, whose local signals are carried by
cable systems in other parts of the country.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said he expects the rules will
end the ``reign of reruns'' on TV, and, by giving broadcasters a
measure of protection, will heighten the value of the programs to
advertisers. More ad revenue, in turn, will foster production of
new programs, he said.
   ``The big winners today are consumers. They will benefit by a
smooth transition to a fairer and more competitive market structure
which promises richer and more diverse programming,'' Patrick said.
   It is unlikely cable systems will have to resort to blackouts to
comply with the rules, Patrick said, because of a one-year
transition period, a variety of exceptions that will be allowed and
the amount of substitute programming that is availble.
   ``Blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause
turmoil for short-term political advantage, which I cannot believe
they will do,'' he said.
   Broadcasters have been pushing the FCC to reimpose exclusivity
rules and were happy with the final product, but the National Cable
Television Association said the action ``pulled the plug on the
favorite TV programs of millions of people.''
   NCTA President James Mooney predicted that ``people whose
favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered,'' and
the costs of syndicated programming will go up.
   The rules are similar to ones the FCC dropped in 1980. Since
then, cable systems have been able to carry the signals of
out-of-town stations such as WTBS in Atlanta, WWOR in the New York
area and WGN in Chicago, which have become known as superstations,
even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought
by a local TV station.
   Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which owns
WTBS, said in a statement the new rules ``do not give the cable
industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts.''
   Turner held out the possibility of a court appeal, but said that
decision would be made after the FCC issues its written rules.
   Jeff Treeman, senior vice president of United Video, the Tulsa,
Okla.-based cable carrier that distributes superstation signals,
including WGN, said cable systems in some large markets, where
independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming, may
have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of
a superstation's programming.
   ``That's enough for the cable operator to drop the signal,'' he
said.
   Under the new syndicated programming exclusivity rules, TV
stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a
syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to
honor that contract. The rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate
rights with cable systems.
   Superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis, under the rules.
   Patrick said the new rules won't go into effect for one year, to
give cable systems time to prepare.
   The rules won't apply to cable systems with fewer than 1,000
subscribers. About half of all cable systems fall into this
category, though they serve only about 5 percent of the nation's 45
million cable subscribers, the FCC said.
   ``You will see more diversity in programs,'' said Edward O.
Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters,
though he added that rules will likely drive up the cost of
syndicated programming.

   Federal health officials are pushing out a
wave of television spots to herald the arrival in the mails next
week of a historic pamphlet on AIDS.
   The first of the 107 million copies being mailed to every
American household are to begin arriving next Thursday, with the
bulk of the deliveries to be completed within two weeks. It marks
the first time the federal government has every mailed a health
message to every household.
   Public Health Service spokesman Jim Brown said Wednesday all the
major networks except NBC, which did not respond, have agreed to
air special spots alerting Americans to be looking for the
eight-page booklet.
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, the No. 2 official in the Department of
Health and Human Services, and Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
wrote letters seeking two minutes of network air time Sunday at
9:58 p.m.
   Brown said the Fox Network and the Cable News Network had agreed
to that request. ABC agreed instead to air a 30-second spot,
featuring Windom and Koop, in four separate slots, including at the
start of its ``Baby M'' movie Saturday night, on ``Good Morning
America'' and during the popular afternoon soap opera ``General
Hospital.''
   Brown said CBS has agreed to broadcast shorter spots promoting
the mailer on 130 occasions during the next two weeks. ``We're
delighted,'' he said.

   Republican George Bush declared Wednesday he
would not ``bargain with drug dealers'' as president, but he still
refused to give his views on reports of a plea-bargain deal with
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   In a day devoted to tough talk on drugs, the vice president
visited a ``rock house'' where the potent cocaine derivative crack
was sold and used, then said in a speech at the Los Angeles Policy
Academy that he would put his vice president in charge of a
``Cabinet-level council of war'' against illegal drugs.
   ``Drug dealers are domestic terrorists, killing kids and cops
and they should be treated as such,'' Bush said. ``I won't bargain
with terrorists and I won't bargain with drug dealers either,
whether they are on U.S. or foreign soil.''
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley was asked if Bush meant that
statement to apply to Noriega. He said Bush responded that his
statement referred to ``the way I would deal with drug dealers as
president.''
   The Reagan administration has been taking part in negotiations
designed to persuade Noreiga to step down from power. Published
reports have said that the dropping of U.S. drug charges against
Noriega would be part of the deal.
   At an earlier appearance Wednesday, Bush was asked again about
such a deal with Noriega. He refused comment as he has each time he
has been asked.
   As for his proposal that his vice president be in charge of a
Bush administration anti-drug effort, he said, ``I've been involved
as vice president as part of the federal effort against drugs. But
I've concluded that's not enough. If I'm elected, I will put my
vice president in charge of every aspect of federal drug policy.
   ``Together we can coordinate an attack on the drug trade that
will be nothing less than a modern D-Day. ... We have not spent the
last 200 years defending our country from despots and dictators,
only to lose our streets to drug dealers and gangs.''
   Bush said of his visit to the storefront ``rock house,'' which
police raided May 2, ``It's not show business. Anybody who has
practical experience, you learn from them. You try to learn and
understand and then take action. ... It's been extraordinarily
helpful.''
   On the last day of a week-long Western campaign swing, Bush went
to the police academy to deliver a speech praising the
administration's drug enforcement efforts but adding, ``We still
have miles to go and we can't rest.''
   ``I'll demand stronger penalties for drug offenders,'' he said.
``Mike Dukakis and Jesse Jackson criticize our anti-drug efforts _
and I readily concede there's room for improvement _ but I want
them to join me in these tougher penalties. This isn't Democratic
or Republican.''
   ``The message should be clear: If you deal drugs you're going to
do time. I want to see drug dealers behind the iron bars of prison,
not law-abiding citizens behind protective bars at home,'' he said.
   Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller said the speech was the first
in a series on drugs with a major one coming up outlining plans for
reorganizing the nation's effort against drug abuse.

<HEAD>Harvard Workers Unionize, But Fight Continues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sometimes bitter labor fight between
Harvard University and 3,300 of its white-collar employees is not
necessarily over now that the workers have voted to unionize, both
sides said Wednesday.
   The day after the narrow union victory, Harvard officials said
they may challenge the results with the National Labor Relations
Board while union representatives accused the university of
violating labor laws and began preparing for contract negotiations
that could last a year or more.
   By a 1,530 to 1,486 vote, the university's clerical and
technical workers, 80 percent of whom are women, approved a bid to
organize under the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
   ``We're all ecstatic,'' said Kristine Rondeau, chief organizer
of the union effort and a former Harvard employee. ``We want to
make this a model for women everywhere.''
   Harvard President Derek Bok, who spent much of his academic
career writing about labor issues and often praised unions, was out
of town Wednesday and unavailable for comment, according to the
university's press office.
   But Anne Taylor, the administrator directing Harvard's response
to the union, said, ``In the event the NLRB declares the union the
winner, Harvard will work constructively with the union in the
interest of support staff and the university.''
   Henry Griggs, AFSCME spokesman, said Harvard's clerical workers
``have waited a long time for this. But they'll have a fight on
their hands. They'll have to negotiate a contract, but at least
this time they'll have a voice.''
   Rondeau didn't want to predict how long negotiations might last,
but Taylor estimated that based on the experiences of Yale and
other schools it would take eight months to a year to develop the
first contract.
   Taylor said university administrators are checking out
complaints from individual workers that union supporters
intimidated them during Tuesday's voting. University administrators
have five working days to file a motion with the NLRB if they
conclude the workers' allegations could be grounds for throwing out
the election.
   The union leveled a countercharge that department supervisors
sought to intimidate workers during the voting by pacing near
polling places.
   These were only the latest in a series of exchanges between the
university and the union.
   Harvard has blasted the union for calling its efforts
``anti-union.'' Taylor said on election day that the union failed
to offer any concrete gains to workers.
   And in a letter sent last month to the clerical workers, Bok
wrote that ``unions have typically resisted efforts to reward
superior achievement.''
   Even in victory, Rondeau refused to back down from her charge
that the university broke labor law by telling workers that if a
union was formed, they would lose all their benefits and have to
begin negotiating from zero.
   In fact, Rondeau said, negotiations will begin at current salary
levels, which the union says average about $18,000 per year and the
university puts at closer to $19,000.
   The union plans to seek increased pension benefits and an end to
the practice of job reclassification, which she called ``a
euphemism for getting rid of older workers.''
   Seven unions currently operate on the Harvard campus,
representing 1,300 workers in such fields as plumbing, building
maintenance, cafeteria work and communications. The AFSCME clerical
union would cover such jobs as librarians, secretaries, biomedical
assistants and copy center operaters.
   Bok, who holds graduate degrees in law and economics and has
been Harvard president since 1971, has published books and articles
in which he has often praised the U.S. labor movement. For example,
a 1971 Harvard law review article said that nowhere else in the
world but the United States ``can one find such an efflorescence of
collectively bargained experiments providing imaginative benefits
for workers.''

<HEAD>Farmers Won't Benefit From Higher Food Costs, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food costs are rising, but farmers will get a
smaller share of what consumers spend this year, an Agriculture
Department report said Wednesday.
   The food marketing bill, or the difference between consumer
expenditures and the farm value of domestically produced food, is
expected to increase 6.6 percent in 1988, compared with a 4.7
percent gain last year.
   Food marketing includes the costs of transporting, processing,
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm.
   ``While food expenditures will rise 4.8 percent _ about the same
as the pace last year _ the farm value of food is expected to
decline 1 percent, because of bigger supplies and lower prices for
livestock and poultry products,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said.
   During the first quarter, consumer food costs rose 3.1 percent
above a year earlier, with much of the increase due to higher
prices for fruit, vegetables and fish.
   Prices for food served in restaurants and fast-food outlets
``rose a little faster than prices for food at home,'' the report
said. For all of 1988, food prices are forecast to rise 2 percent
to 4 percent from 1987, when they increased 4.1 percent.
   The report continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers
at $50 billion to $55 billion, down from last year's record of $57
billion. Rising production costs and lower federal payments to
farmers are factors in this year's decline.

<HEAD>Governor, Mayor Jubilant Over Annexation Of Denver Airport Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Roy Romer and Mayor Federico Pena on
Wednesday went to the barren site of what could become the nation's
largest airport to celebrate voters' decision to allow the city to
annex 45 square miles of land for the project.
   ``There still are a lot of people asking questions and that's
fair,'' Pena said in a tent at the site. ``We are going to get the
project done and meet our goal'' to open the airport by the summer
of 1994.
   The proposal on Tuesday won the support of 34,070 voters in
suburban Adams County, or 55.9 percent, while 26,928, or 44.1
percent, voted against it. A total of 47.6 percent of the county's
voters cast ballots.
   Denver proposes a $3 billion replacement for Stapleton
International Airport, now the fifth-busiest in the country. The
new airport, 10 miles northeast of Stapleton and 17 miles from
downtown, could be the second-busiest in the nation by the year
2000, estimates show.
   Pena said construction now is virtually assured. ``This is the
rocket booster that pushes the airport project forward,'' he said.
   But some financial issues remain unresolved and an environmental
review and legal challenges are ahead. If those are resolved,
ground for the new facility could be broken in the summer of 1989.
   Denver has asked for $500 million over five years in federal
aid, and the city this summer will turn over its environmental
assessment to the Federal Aviation Administration for review.
   Opponents, who had expressed concern about increased air
pollution, jet noise and other environmental effects, vowed to
continue their fight.
   Hal Shroyer of suburban Westminster, one of the most outspoken
foes of the new airport, has filed a lawsuit contesting the wording
of the ballot issue.
   ``I think the courts will throw the election out because of the
faulty ballot title. They put those six words in, `For the benefit
of Adams County,''' Shroyer said.
   Stapleton, which is 59 years old, would be torn down and the
land converted for development and open space. Its replacement
would be the first major airport built from scratch in the United
States since the Dallas-Fort Worth airport was built in 1974.
   Nearly 35 million pasengers fly through Stapleton every year,
but officials say FAA projections indicate 50 million passengers
are expected through Denver by 1995. The new airport could
accommodate 100 million passengers a year.

<HEAD>Patriarch Cancels Plans to Attend Russian Church Celebrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios will not
attend celebrations in Moscow marking the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in Russia, Orthodox Church officials said Wednesday.
   Dimitrios, spiritual leader of the world's 180 million Orthodox
Christians, refused to join the celebrations next month because
they would include U.S. and other Orthodox leaders he doesn't
recognize as independent.
   ``The patriarch will not participate in a liturgy that includes
the leaders of the Russian Orthodox churches of Japan and North
America,'' said Yiannis Hadzifotis, spokesman for the Orthodox
Church of Greece.
   Metropolitan Bartholomew, private secretary to the
Istanbul-based patriarch, said only that patriarch would not attend
``because appropriate conditions for participation do not exist.''
   Dimitrios also decided not to send a delegation from the
patriarchate to the celebrations next month, church officials in
Athens and Istanbul said.
   The Orthodox Church in America is derived from the Russian
Orthodox church, which granted the U.S. church independent status
in 1970. It is fully recognized by other Eastern Orthodox bodies in
the United States. But U.S. church sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said there may be some difficulty with Dimitrios
recognizing its independence.
   The centerpiece of the 10-day anniversary celebrations is a June
5 service at Moscow's Patriarchal Cathedral. The service was
scheduled to be conducted by Dimitrios with Russian Patriarch Pimen
and other Orthodox patriarchs.
   The Communist Party is officially atheist, but Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has backed the church's millennium
celebrations as part of his restructuring of society.
   Dimitrios made a publicized visit to the Soviet Union in August
and said earlier this year he would attend the Russian church's
millennium ceremonies.
   Hadzifotis said Russian clerics organizing the celebrations have
insisted that leaders of the Russian Orthodox churches of North
America and Japan take part in the June 5 service, along with the
head of the breakaway Orthodox Church of Macedonia.
   ``This is not correct. None of these churches has been
recognized as autocephalous (independent) by the ecumenical
patriarchate and their leaders cannot be regarded as equal to the
other patriarchs,'' he said.
   Among Orthodox patriarchs, Dimitrios is regarded as first among
equals as head of the oldest Orthodox church.
   The Russian church's decision to grant the American and Japanese
churches independent status is a considered a serious breach of
Orthodox practice, Hadzifotis said.
   Dimitrios also objects to the Russian church's claim that the
Patriarchate of Georgia should stand higher in the hierarchy than
those of Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania, he said.
   Normally, a pan-Orthodox conference would be required to upgrade
the status of smaller Orthodox churches.
   ``In the eyes of other Orthodox churches, the Russians'
unilateral actions are seen as an attempt to challenge the
ecumenical patriarch's authority and dominate the course of
Orthodox Christianity,'' said a senior Greek Orthodox churchman who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Angry mourners walked out of a
funeral Mass for a shooting victim after a Roman Catholic bishop
asked forgiveness for the Protestant killers and denounced reported
IRA threats of retaliation.
   About 20 mourners left St. Patrick's Roman Catholic church after
the remarks by Bishop Cahal Daly at the funeral of Stephen McGahan,
27, one of three Catholic men killed in Sunday's shooting at a pub
patronized by Catholics.
   The Protestant Action Force, an outlawed extremist paramilitary
group, claimed responsibility.
   Daly said he prayed ``for the perpetrators of these murders as
well as their victims'' and urged them ``to be free from their
murdering hate.''
   He also denounced reported threats by the Irish Republican Army,
which is fighting to unite this mainly Protestant British province
with the Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   As the bishop finished speaking, some mourners walked out of the
church.
   ``We feel very, very bitter and he only makes us feel more
bitterness toward Protestants,'' said mourner Eddie Kane.
   After the shooting, Patrick McBride, whose 27-year-old brother,
Paul, was those killed, called for peace. ``I don't want any
innocent Protestants to be killed as a result of this,'' he said.

   President Reagan declared today that
``excessive drug politics'' is getting in the way of the battle
against narcotics trafficking and urged that a congressional and
executive branch task force be formed to recommend solutions.
   Speaking to the graduating class of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy
here, Reagan called drug abuse ``the foremost concern in our
country,'' and said there must be a calming of political debate.
   ``If America's anti-drug effort gets tripped up in partisanship,
if we permit politics to determine policy, it will mean a disaster
for our future and that of our children,'' he said.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., one of the administration's
harshest critics on drug policy, scoffed at the tone of Reagan's
speech, saying in advance that the nation ``needs action,'' not
talk.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Tuesday had said
Reagan was ``very frustrated'' about the progress of efforts to
combat drug abuse.
   Reagan said in his speech that he was ``calling on both houses
of the Congress, both sides of the aisle, to join with my
representatives in a special executive-legislative task force to
advance America's unified response to the problem of illegal drug
use.''
   He said the task force should find a consensus on ways to block
the supply of illegal drugs, reduce demand and improve interdiction
efforts.
   ``Nothing should be overlooked or ruled out,'' he said, asking,
``If we cannot remove the politics from drugs, how can we hope to
remove the drugs from our communities, workplaces and schools?''
   Reagan announced, among other things, that he has directed
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ``to tap the best minds both
inside and outside of government to come up with creative solutions
on how we can better use military resources and technologies to
detect drugs.''
   ``It is time to make illegal drugs `Public Enemy No. 1,' '' he
said. Reagan in April 1987 had proclaimed AIDS as ``Public Enemy
No. 1'' during a speech to a medical audience in Philadelphia.
   Before the speech, Reagan arranged to visit the Coast Guard
cutter ``Vigorous'' for a briefing about its drug-interdiction
procedures and then have lunch with crew members before the speech
to some 160 members of the 107th graduating class.
   Reagan spoke in the wake of harsh criticism of an administration
offer to drop drug-trafficking indictments against Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega in return for Noriega's agreement
to relinquish power.
   Reagan refused to confirm or deny the offer Tuesday, telling
reporters that ``I can't comment on negotiations that are under
way.''
   But the administration's move has infuriated many members of
Congress, and has been injected into the presidential campaign and
congressional debate over whether to increase the role of the U.S.
military in drug interdiction efforts.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr. told reporters
today that ``by whatever means, we're going to use that (Noriega
indictment) to try to implement administration policy, which is to
see that Noriega leaves power, leaves the country and paves the way
for democratic rule in that nation.''
   In his speech, however, Reagan said, ``Our policy is one of
`zero tolerance' for illegal drugs, and we are looking for
solutions, not just a restatement of the problem.''
   The speech came amid growing sentiment in Congress for tougher
laws to deal with drug traffickers, including proposals to impose
the death sentence on those who commit murder in the drug trade.
   Fitzwater on Tuesday said that ``there is much more to be done
on both the demand and supply side of drug abuse.''
   He said Reagan is ``very frustrated, too, with the progress
against drugs.''
   ``I think the president hopes that people will be careful and
realistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort,'' he
said. ``Everybody wants to out-drug each other in terms of
political rhetoric. ... ''
   D'Amato scoffed at the White House's claim to want politics
taken out of the debate.
   ``If we took action, there wouldn't be any necessity for
rhetoric,'' he said. ``It's naive for his speechwriters to say,
`Drop the political rhetoric,' if they are going to make a deal
with the scoundrel'' in Panama.

<HEAD>Bill Offered to Abolish Asset-Disposal Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats on the House Banking Committee on
Wednesday introduced legislation that would dissolve a heavily
criticized agency created to dispose of property from insolvent
savings institutions.
   The bill, whose lead sponsors are Reps. Paul E. Kanjorski,
D-Pa., Thomas C. McMillen, D-Md., and House Banking Committee
Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., would abolish the Federal
Asset Disposition Agency, or FADA, within 60 days.
   Its functions would be turned over to the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., the government fund that insures S&L deposits
up to $100,000.
   St Germain told reporters he would attach the bill to
legislation granting banks new powers, including the ability to
underwrite certain securities. Kanjorski said he expected the
committee to act on that bill by June 15.
   McMillen said the 3-year-old FADA, which oversees $4.2 billion
in real estate and loans, has spent more than $100 million and has
managed to dispose of only $775 million in assets.
   ``FADA is a classic example of a government agency gone
haywire,'' Kanjorski said.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates federally insured savings institutions, has argued
that new FADA management installed in February is cleaning up the
agency and trimming waste. He said in a letter last week that
dismantling FADA would cost millions of dollars.
   The dissolution bill is sponsored by 24 of the 30 Democrats on
the Banking Committee and one other Democrat, Rep. James J. Florio
of New Jersey. It has no Republican support.

   The military can do little to stem the flow of
drugs into the United States, a private study says.
   ``There are dozens of ways of bringing drugs into the country,
and only a few of them can be effectively blocked by the
military,'' said RAND Corp. economist Peter Reuter, main author of
the 154-page report by the California think tank.
   The Pentagon-contracted report came in the wake of congressional
votes to increase the use of the military in the war against drugs.
   And President Reagan on Wednesday said he had directed Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ``to tap the best minds both inside and
outside of government to come up with creative solutions on how we
can better use military resources and technologies to detect and
interdict drugs coming into this country.''
   Carlucci has opposed using the military in the war against drugs.
   Nevertheless, the House has passed a far-reaching amendment to
the $299.5 billion defense authorization bill calling for the
military to virtually seal off U.S. borders to drug-running.
   The Senate passed a slightly less sweeping version. But the bill
still gives the military a larger role in stopping the flow of
illegal drugs into the country. It would give new arrest powers to
Navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats on the
high seas.
   Differences between the two bills will be resolved in a
House-Senate conference committee.
   But Reuter said using the military won't help.
   ``Smugglers adapt. As interdictors make risks and costs higher,
smugglers shift to other methods of bringing drugs into the
country,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
   Reuter said his study found that use of the armed forces against
drug smugglers has had little effect so far, despite large
increases in expenditures.
   Pentagon expenditures in the drug war rose from $1 million in
1981 to $196 million in 1986, while non-military expenditures rose
from $263 million to $605 million.
   Seizures of cocaine rose from less than 2 million metric tons in
1981 to more than 25 metric tons in 1986, but the amount of cocaine
estimated to have entered the country jumped by 150 percent over
the same period. A metric ton is about 2,200 pounds.
   The main contribution of the military so far has been the use of
radar planes to spot possible smugglers as they approach U.S.
shores, the RAND study said.
   But the military may not shoot down suspected drug smugglers,
and ground-based law enforcement officials have had mixed results
intercepting suspicious planes as they land.
   Reuter and two colleagues from RAND, Gordon Crawford and
Jonathon Cave, designed a computer model to determine the effect of
increasing the risks and costs of smuggling drugs into the United
States.
   If a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine costs $15,000 to deliver
to the United States, it has a value of $250,000 when sold on the
street in one ounce packets, they found.
   Tripling the smuggling cost ``will have a very small impact on
the street value of the cocaine,'' Reuter said, because the
increase can be passed down the chain or partially absorbed in the
huge retail price.
   The report was prepared by RAND's National Defense Research
Institute, which is funded by the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Carlucci Tells Congress That Unneeded Bases Should Be Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Closing unneeded military bases is an idea
whose time has come because of the present drive to cut federal
spending and reduce the deficit, Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci said Wednesday.
   ``It makes sense to look seriously now at closing bases, because
our military force structure is being reduced and growth in the
defense budget is being slowed,'' Carlucci told a House
subcommittee.
   ``We must stop spending money to operate bases we do not need,''
he said. ``Our increasingly scarce resources simply must be applied
to higher defense priorities, so that we do not jeopardize
America's national security interests.''
   Carlucci was testifying in support of a plan designed to
surmount the strong reluctance of Congress to allow military bases
to be closed.
   The nation has about 3,800 military installations and Pentagon
officials estimate that between $2 billion and $5 billion annually
could be saved if unneeded bases were shut down.
   But bases mean jobs and Congress has erected such strong
barriers against base closures that no major installations have
been closed since 1977.
   The current plan calls for creation of a Pentagon commission to
review bases by Dec. 31 and recommend a list of which can be
closed. Carlucci would then have 15 days to accept or reject the
entire list. His decision would be made less than a week before the
end of President Reagan's term in office.
   The bill offered by Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, proposes having
Carlucci pick a nine-member commission.
   The defense budget bill now pending in the Senate calls for a
15-member commission, including the nine persons already chosen by
Carlucci and six more who would be selected by Carlucci after
consultation with Capitol Hill.
   The last time the Pentagon suggested closing any bases was in
1985, when a list of 22 was sent to Capitol Hill. But congressional
outcries halted any action.
   Using that list as an example, Carlucci said $6 million could
have been saved in each of the past two years had the bases been
shut down.
   The list was put together when the Pentagon budget was growing,
said Carlucci. ``Today, the opportunity for realignments and
closures is surely greater than it was three years ago.''
   ``We don't expect a larger fighting force,'' he said. ``The Air
Force has fewer fighter wings than it was forecasting in 1985, the
Navy has fewer ships than it proposed and the Army has fewer combat
elements. A smaller, more robust base structure makes far more
sense now than it has at any time over the past 10 years.''
   Armey said, ``There's been an important twist in the
base-closing debate. We're no longer talking about `if' we can
close obsolete bases, we're talking about `how' we can close
obsolete bases.''
   The commission plan also proposes a one-time waiver that would
allow the bases to be shut down without going through the complex
and lengthy environmental reports now required of the Pentagon.
   Carlucci said there was a ``widespread misconception that base
closures cause the local community to suffer devastating economic
effects.''
   ``The truth is quite different,'' he said. ``The facts are that
most communities affected by previous base closures have had strong
economic recovery.''
   A Pentagon survey of 100 communities where bases had been closed
show that 94,000 Defense Department civilian jobs were lost but
they had been replaced by 138,000 new civilian jobs, he said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Sees No Convention Fight; Bush Talks Tough on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis said Wednesday he doubted Jesse Jackson would
pick a fight at the Democratic National Convention this summer, and
added he hopes to select a running mate before the session
convenes. Vice President George Bush visited a one-time drug
hangout to dramatize his opposition to drugs.
   Jackson met with Jewish leaders in California in hopes of
defusing suspicions over his candidacy. One rabbi spoke of a
reconciliation, but demonstrators outside booed Jackson and
chanted, ``Lose, Jesse, Lose.''
   Dukakis, fresh from Tuesday's landslide victory in the Oregon
primary, is the faraway favorite in public opinion polls in
California. He hopes to clinch a nominating majority by the time
the primary season ends in three weeks with elections in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   The Massachusetts governor also has received good news in
nationwide polling matchups against Bush in recent days, and top
Bush aides were quoted as being particularly concerned over
indications that their man is viewed unfavorably by a large
percentage of voters.
   ``If those numbers are that way by election time, it's pretty
insurmountable,'' Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said in an
interview with the Boston Globe. But Fuller and other aides said
Bush's standing as measured by the polls could improve dramatically
virtually overnight.
   Bush, wrapping up a week-long West Coast campaign swing, spent
about 15 minutes in a storefront in Los Angeles that police said
had been a drug location. He said he would not ``bargain with drug
dealers'' as president, whether they were in the United States or
on foreign soil.
   Still, he refused once again to offer an opinion on reports of
Reagan administration plea bargaining with Panamanian leader Manuel
Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug charges.
   In a speech before flying home, Bush said he would mount an
attack against drugs that would be ``nothing less than a modern
D-Day'' and urged his Democratic rivals to join him in calling for
tougher penalties for convicted drug dealers.
   Dukakis made no mention of Bush at a news conference in Boston.
   Instead, he said he doubted Jackson would mar the anticipated
tranquility at the party's nominating convention by challenging
delegate selection rules.
   ``I don't think we are going to have a fight with Mr. Jackson at
the convention,'' he said.
   Jackson has complained in recent weeks that his support among
``super delegates'' _ party leaders who will have voting rights at
the convention _ does not match his success in primaries. Dukakis
said Jackson ``has a perfect right to voice criticism,'' but noted
that Jackson knew the rules before entering the race.
   Even so, top aides to Jackson released the text of a letter they
sent to Democratic Chairman Paul Kirk, saying that ``the vote of
the people is distorted'' by Dukakis' overwhelming advantage in
super delegates.
   As for his vice presidential running mate, Dukakis said he would
not turn his attention to the search until the primary season is
concluded.
   ``If I'm the nominee I would hope that the decision will be made
before the convention, sure, or at least the recommendations,'' he
said.
   Paul Brountas, a law school classmate and close friend of the
governor, is expected to head the search effort.
   Dukakis made his comments before heading off to campaign stops
in New York and New Jersey.
   Jackson already was in California, where he is mounting an
intense primary campaign. He said his 90-minute session with a
dozen Los Angles area rabbis and other Jewish leaders was ``the
beginning of a meaningful and in-depth dialogue'' with critics of
his candidacy.
   He said the sesson was a ``step toward healing wounds.''
   One participant, Rabbi Allen Freehling said ``the litany of
complaints in the Jewish community with Jesse Jackson'' was aired,
and there was ``a reconciliation.''
   Outside the session, though, a dozen demonstrators chanted
``Lose, Jesse, Lose, and ``Jew hater.''
   Many Jews have been suspicious of Jackson in part because of his
1979 meeting with Yasser Arafat, the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, his 1984 reference to New York as
``Hymietown'' and other incidents.

   Police were ordered Wednesday to shoot
troublemakers on sight in the western city of Aurangabad, where two
days of Hindu-Moslem rioting have left 11 dead, a police official
reported.
   News of the riots spread and a 12th person was stabbed to death
in Poona, another city in Maharashtra state, officials said.
   Authorities imposed a curfew on Aurangabad, 350 miles east of
Bombay, but lifted it for four hours Wednesday so Moslems could
celebrate the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month.
   S. Ramamurthy, commissioner of the police intelligence
department, said more than 500 police officers had been deployed in
neighborhoods in Aurangabad.
   ``Stray incidents of stabbing ... are a major problem,'' he
said. ``We just can't have policemen in every lane to stop the
stabbing spree.''
   Three of the 11 victims were killed by police gunfire and the
rest died of stab wounds during fights between Moslems and Hindus,
Ramamurthy said. Nearly 100 people have been reported injured.
   The violence began after a court dismissed a petition filed by
Shiv Sena, a militant Hindu group, challenging the election May 6
of Mayor Shantaram Kale, a Hindu supported by a Moslem organization.
   Shiv Sena organized a rally outside the court and police said
the crowd turned into a mob after the petition was dismissed. They
said gangs of Hindus and Moslems attacked homes and businesses in
the city of 315,000 people.
   About 12 percent of India's 800 million people are Moslems and
82 percent are Hindus. The two ethnic groups have a long history of
conflict.

   Bill Cosby was coy about whether 1988-89 would
be the final season for ``The Cosby Show,'' but he said he's going
all out next year.
   ``This is our fifth season, and it's supposed to be our last, so
I'm going to have my fun this year _ not in messing up, but in
doing things even better,'' said Cosby, who appeared at NBC's
unveiling of its fall schedule for advertisers.
   He has previously said he would only do the show five years. In
its four seasons so far, it has consistently been the top-rated
network show and is credited with making NBC the No. 1 network.
   ``If he's having fun and he's got stories to tell, we might
convince him to come back,'' said NBC Entertainment President
Brandon Tartikoff, adding that NBC had held no formal talks with
Cosby.
   Cosby gave a plug to the striking Writers Guild of America,
promising the show would be as good as ever ``once we get our
writers back.''
   ``They're asking for more money, and they're going to get it ..
. If they don't come back, it's all over for TV _ and you all have
no jobs.''
   The 2-month-old strike centers on creative control and royalties
from syndication.
   Cosby pleaded, mostly tongue-in-cheek, with the advertisers to
buy time on his show next season. A frequent pitchman for a number
of products, he added: ``Some of you have not called me to do
commercials for you. I have your names.''
   As for ``A Different World,'' the critically bludgeoned but
commercially successful spinoff of his show, Cosby said, ```A
Different World' is sort of a payback, a chance to see a child who
says, `I know what I'm doing,' go off and take care of him or
herself. We've gotten rid of all the people who didn't know what it
was about.''
   Debbie Allen, a former producer on ``Fame,'' has been brought in
to produce ``A Different World'' next year. Her sister, Phylicia
Rashad, plays Cosby's wife.

   The rock 'n' roll of ``Cousin Brucie,'' the
horror of the ``Inner Sanctum'' and Don Dunphy's fight
announcements were recognized at the first induction into the
Emerson Radio Hall of Fame.
   Eighteen radio legends, including the late Orson Welles and
Edward R. Murrow, were inducted in a ceremony that honored radio as
much as it paid tribute to the personalities.
   ``Radio is a vital, living immediate thing,'' said Himan Brown,
who was honored as producer of ``Inner Sanctum.''
   ``We are all a part of radio. It's not something that's in the
past. It surrounds us,'' he told the 250 people at the ceremony
Tuesday at the Empire State Building.
   ``Cousin Brucie'' Morrow, host of the oldies show, ``Cruisin'
America,'' was inducted in the radio personality category, and
Dunphy, a top fight announcer, was honored in the sportscaster
category.
   ``To be amongst names like Orson Welles and Arthur Godfrey, Alan
Freed and Martin Block, who I grew up with ... and all the people
like Don Dunphy and Himan Brown _ to think that I am to be walking
among these legends, these eagles one day, is way beyond my great
expectations,'' he said.

   Johnny Mathis reached the top of the
charts early in his career with songs like ``Chances Are'' and
``Wonderful Wonderful.''
   But the truth is, he has never liked his recorded versions of
the songs.
   ``Honestly, it doesn't bother me if I don't have another
million-seller,'' said Mathis, who is performing this week at
Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino.
   Mathis' debut album was released by Columbia records jazz
division and went nowhere. He was teamed with Mitch Miller,
producer of his top-ten pop hits, but Mathis said the musical
arrangements ``were frivolous and didn't require vocalization.''
   ``I sang the way he wanted me to sing,'' Mathis said. ``It was
what I needed for a hit record, but it was stifling and not
creative.''

   Actor Peter O'Toole will temporarily defy
a court order to return to New Jersey with his 5-year-old son
because he wants to do what's in the best interest of the child,
the actor's attorney said Wednesday.
   Monmouth Superior Court Judge Alexander D. Lehrer ordered
O'Toole to give his son, Lorcan, to his mother Tuesday or face a
$1,000-a-day fine and possible arrest.
   But O'Toole remained in London with the boy, said Jeffrey P.
Weinstein, a Roseland attorney representing the actor.
   Raoul Felder, attorney for the boy's mother and O'Toole's former
girlfriend, Karen Sommerville O'Toole, said he would seek O'Toole's
arrest shortly. Weinstein said neither he nor his client has been
notified of any arrest warrant.
   Weinstein would not specify why O'Toole's keeping the child was
beneficial but did say he believes O'Toole wants to be present at a
June 14 custody hearing before Lehrer.
   O'Toole and Ms. O'Toole met about six years ago but never
married. After the child was born, the mother began using O'Toole's
last name. A short time later, the couple split and have been
embroiled in a custody dispute.

   The Federal Communications Commission issued a
notice Wednesday reminding broadcasters that accepting unreported
payments in exchange for airplay of programming is a crime.
   The FCC said it was putting out the reminder in light of the
recent indictments of four people in California following a
two-year investigation of ``payola'' practices in the broadcast
industry.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the commission wanted to let
broadcasters know ``we will take appropriate action'' in response
to any payola allegations.
   Payola is the unreported payment to or acceptance by employees
of broadcast stations, program producers or program suppliers of
money or services for airplay of programming.
   If matter in a program has been paid for, the law requires a
broadcaster to announce that and to disclose the sponsor.
   Violations carry criminal penalties of up to one year in prison
and fines of up to $10,000.
   In February, two independent music promoters, a former radio
executive and a promoter's wife were indicted on bribery, tax
evasion and other charges stemming from the payola investigation.

Practice Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Nevada Supreme Court issued an
opinion Wednesday reaffirming an order issued in November to let
ousted federal judge Harry Claiborne practice law despite
imprisonment for tax evasion.
   Justice Tom Steffen wrote the long-awaited formal opinion, which
concludes that no further punishment should be imposed on
Claiborne, 71, who spent 17 months behind bars after being
impeached as a U.S. district judge in October 1986.
   Claiborne was named a federal judge in 1978. He was impeached
following his conviction for failing to report $107,000 on his 1979
and 1980 tax returns. The impeachment was the first of its sort in
more than a half-century.
   Claiborne maintained he was a victim of a Justice Department
vendetta. He alleged misconduct by federal agents and bias on the
part of his trial judge, Walter Hoffman.
   The case against Claiborne started out as an investigation into
allegations that Claiborne took a $30,000 bribe to derail an FBI
probe into brothel owner Joe Conforte. A trial in Reno on bribery
and other charges resulted in a hung jury, and a retrial on the
bribery charge was thrown out.
   Claiborne, born in McRae, Ark., got his law degree from
Cumberland University and was admitted to the Arkansas Bar in 1942.
He was admitted to the Nevada Bar a few years later, worked two
years as a deputy prosecutor and also served as a one-term
Democratic state assemblyman.
   In his opinion, Justice Steffen outlined the history of
Claiborne's removal from office, the claims of investigatory
misconduct, the federal government's bargain with Conforte,
Claiborne's trial, his professional background and the tension
between federal agents and Nevada's federal judges.
   Steffen said it was regrettable that Claiborne was unable to get
evidentiary hearings into his claims of bias and misconduct, adding
that there was evidence within the federal Justice Department of
``appalling arrogance, contemptuousness, and a lack of decorum.''
   ``If our review of the record had enabled us to conclude, in
good conscience, that Claiborne had been fairly prosecuted and
convicted, we unhesitatingly would have imposed severe sanctions,''
Steffen said.
   He stressed that the high court's decision wasn't based simply
on legal technicalities and acknowledge that some critics would
disagree with the ruling.
   But Claiborne's felony conviction, while serious, ``was no
ordinary conviction,'' Steffen said. ``Questionable investigative
and prosecutorial motivations, as well as anomalous and arguably
unfair practices and procedures, pervade the record of this matter
from its inception.''
   The ruling included a separate 9-page concurring statement from
Chief Justice Al Gunderson, who said it was fortunate the Claiborne
case didn't end ``with his total annihilation.''
   Gunderson concluded that the federal government's pursuit of
Claiborne ``began with a fixed purpose _ but without any evidence
whatever _ that the U.S. District Court judge should be destroyed.''

   Families and friends of some of the 16 people
killed in last year's Amtrak crash in Maryland visited Capitol Hill
on Wednesday to urge lawmakers to approve a long-stalled
drug-testing bill.
   ``We can sit at home and cry about what's happened, or come down
here and tell these people to move ahead,'' said Dr. Roger Horn of
Hunt Valley, Md.
   Horn, whose daughter, Ceres, 16, died in the accident, and about
100 other people spent their day visiting the offices of the 432
members of the House.
   Their focus was legislation that would require random, mandatory
drug and alcohol testing for railroad, airline, bus and trucking
industry employees. The measure would affect about 3.3 million of
the nation's transportation workers.
   The proposal has been the subject of House-Senate negotiations
since the beginning of the year. It has been the major obstacle to
the completion of work on an airline passenger consumer protection
bill, into which it was inserted by the Senate. The version of the
bill passed by the House contains no drug-testing provision.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, has jurisdiction over bills affecting railroad
workers and has so far opposed the testing provision. He has
expressed fears about ``rampant incompetence and faulty procedures
of the nation's laboratories.''
   But Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., a leading sponsor of the testing
measure, said at a news conference Wednesday, ``The key to solving
the problem of drug and alcohol use by people in safety related
transportation jobs is testing, which includes mandatory random
testing.''
   According to the Department of Transportation, in the first 14
months after the Jan. 4, 1987, Amtrak accident at Chase, Md., there
were 37 rail accidents in which one or more workers tested
positively afterward for illegal drug use, and four accidents in
which alcohol use was detected.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded that
marijuana use was the primary cause of the Maryland accident, in
which three linked Conrail engines passed a stop signal and ran in
front of a crowded Amtrak commuter train. Sixteen people were
killed and 175 injured.
   Also Wednesday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Dick
Stafford said 39 air traffic controllers and other agency workers
have been relieved from their duties after testing positive for
drug use since the FAA began the examinations last year.
   Of those, 31 are still employed by the FAA but may be undergoing
drug rehabilitation programs, five resigned and three have been
fired, according to Stafford's figures.
   During the period, 1,652 FAA workers received random drug tests
and 25,161 others were tested as part of their annual medical
exams, he said.
   Stafford presented the figures after Danforth cited similar
numbers at the news conference.

   The House on Wednesday called on Soviet
leaders to grant general amnesty to imprisoned Christians on the
1,000th anniversary of Christianity in Russia.
   The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., was
adopted by a 394-0 vote.
   The resolution also calls on the Soviets to widen religious
freedom.
   Smith said he believes the strong support will have an impact on
Soviet leaders, who now control 219 known religious prisoners.
   ``It sends a clear signal about how Congress and the American
people cherish religious freedom everywhere,'' Smith said.
   Smith said the aim of the resolution was ``religious glasnost,''
using Soviet leader Michael S. Gorbachev's term to describe his new
policy of openness.
   The passage of the resolution was timed for the May 29-June 2
summit meeting between Gorbachev and President Reagan in Moscow,
Smith said.
   According to the resolution, this year marks the millennium of
the arrival of Christianity in the Ukraine, now part of the Soviet
Union. In the year 988, the grand prince of Kiev invited Byzantine
priests to teach the Christian faith in the region.

   Using the armed forces in an all-out assault on

not want to contemplate, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
said Wednesday.
   ``To solve the drug problem and still guarantee all Americans
the rights and privileges they enjoy today is a difficult thing,''
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. told a news conference before a luncheon
speech at the Economic Club of Detroit
   Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs since October 1985, said the
armed forces would carry out whatever anti-drug trade measures
Congress assigned them.
   ``I think there are things we can do, primarily identification,
surveillance and tracking of people bringing in drugs in illicit
fashion,'' he said.
   But he said, ``To truly stop the flow of drugs you would have to
increase police powers and do some searches and seizures that are
not contemplated today.''
   Crowe also said he foresaw no quick end to U.S. military
involvement in the Persian Gulf and no increased activity in Panama.
   He referred to negotiations aimed at persuading Panamanian ruler
Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave. ``The U.S. government is
interested in bringing that about,'' he said.
   He said he did not expect increased U.S. military activity in
Panama, but said the United States would defend its strategic
interest in keeping the Panama Canal open.

   The pro-Vietnamese government of
Cambodia has convened an unprecedented national congress to discuss
ways to fight guerrilla infiltration of villages.
   Representatives of about 500 model communes across the country
attended the opening of the congress in the capital, Phnom Penh, on
Monday, the official Communist Party newspaper Pracheachon said.
   The paper said while the Cambodian government has made advances,
guerrillas were conducting psychological warfare along the Thai
border area ``with impunity.''
   The paper said the party's ruling Politburo ``considers the
localities as a matter of life or death to the revolution ... as
the core battlefield, and the work of building and consolidating
localities, villages, communes, units and army bases as the key
task in 1988.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ousting the Khmer Rouge
rulers. The communist Khmer Rouge now forms the largest of three
guerrilla groups.
   Pracheachon said the guerrillas were moving into the interior of
the country to spread propaganda against the government and
encourage criticism of Vietnam. It said the rebels were planting
agents and preparing for 1990, when Vietnam has said it will
withdraw the last of its troops from Cambodia.
   The Cambodian government is trying to lure guerrillas and their
supporters back to the fold with promises of amnesty, jobs and
rewards.
   However, the paper said, ``the enemy is still able to conduct
his activities at a number of remote villages and communes along
the Cambodian-Thai border, frequently making unchecked entries
into, exits from, and passages through these localities and
intimidating the local people with impunity.''
   A text of the paper's editorial was obtained from a Western
embassy in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   Cambodians are torn between deep-seated enmity for Vietnam and
for the Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of thousands of
people during its nearly four-year rule.
   On May 10, Khmer Rouge radio claimed that guerrillas smashed the
Vietnamese administrative network in more than 4,000 villages and
200 communes during the seven-month dry season that ended in April.
   Vietnam was forced to transfer important units from the
Thai-Cambodian border to the interior to defend against attacks, it
claimed.
   However, Khmer Rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated.

   Social Security and welfare recipients in
urban areas have the most difficulty getting their government
checks cashed by banks where they do not have an account, the
General Accounting Office told Congress on Wednesday.
   ``Some individuals do not have depository accounts and are not
able to cash their checks at local banks or thrifts,'' Assistant
Comptroller General Richard L. Fogel told a Senate banking
subcommittee.
   Instead, he said, they cash their checks at check cashers,
grocery stores, liquor stores, bars and with relatives.
   Fogel released a preliminary report to the panel which found
that ``the unbanked population of the United States is at the lower
end of the income scale, relies relatively heavily on government
benefit programs, includes a significant percentage of the
unemployed, and most have 12 years or less of education.''
   Consumer groups argue that in 1987, anywhere between 71 percent
and 88 percent of the banks and thrifts would not cash checks for
non-customers at any price. The GAO indicated that in 1985, nearly
86 percent of banks and 55 percent of thrifts cashed Treasury
checks for non-depositors.
   Fogel said he saw no disparity between the statistics because
the consumer groups' studies targeted urban areas while the GAO
report was nationwide, including rural and suburban as well as
urban areas.
   Fogel said there is no current, nationally representative survey
of the check cashing experience. ``Nonetheless, it is our
impression that access is considerably more of a problem in urban
locations than in rural ones,'' he said.
   The report of the GAO, investigative arm of Congress, said banks
do not cash government checks for non-depositors because of the
costs involved in performing the service free of charge, congestion
of their facilities and potential fraud.
   Fogel testified before the Senate Banking consumer affairs
subcommittee on legislation, sponsored by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, to require banks to cash government checks for
non-depositors once they have registered with the bank. A similar
measure has been introduced in the House.
   ``My bill would ensure that individuals do not have to chase all
over town to cash their government checks,'' Metzenbaum said. ``And
it would ensure that senior citizens and low income persons were
not charged exorbitant fees for the privilege of cashing such
checks.''
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, chairman of the House banking
committee, said he favored the Metzenbaum bill and a similar one
introduced by Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. in the House.
   St Germain said any comprehensive banking bill passed by
Congress this year will contain a version of required check-cashing
legislation. Both Metzenbaum and Schumer have said they are willing
to modify their proposals but that the banking industry has opposed
any such effort.
   August Zinsser III, representing the American Bankers
Association, told the committee the legislation would subject banks
to large fraud losses and ``is premature, inappropriate and unfair
to depository institutions.''
   Zinsser said, ``This legislation presents a window of
opportunity for individuals to use banks to perpetuate fraud
through the pretext of cashing checks. Organized crime, in
particular, would find the bill particularly useful and
profitable.''
   However, in answer to a question by Metzenbaum, Fogel said the
GAO study found the actual dollar amount the Treasury Department
reclaims from banks and thrifts or refuses payment on to be smaller
than the claims of banking groups imply.
   Fogel said the final GAO report would be published in September
but doubted that there would be any major changes.

   The Navy said Wednesday it had decided to
return the mine-damaged frigate Samuel B. Roberts from the Persian
Gulf aboard a commercial heavy-lift ship.
   The service said it hoped to award a contract for the ferry
operation in the next few days and then load the frigate in
mid-June for the trip back to the United States.
   The Navy announced April 29 the ship would be repaired at the
Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, where it was built.
   The alternative to having another ship carry the vessel back to
the United States would involve performing fairly extensive repairs
and then towing it home, the Navy said. The ship is currently in
dry dock in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
   According to the Navy, a number of companies that operate
heavy-lift ships were asked to bid on the job recently. There are
probably about two dozen such ships in the world capable of doing
the job, the service said. Such vessels are normally used to carry
huge oil-drilling rigs to new locations.
   ``With the exception of approximately 10 crewmen who will ride
the heavy-lift ship, the crew of the USS Roberts will fly to their
home port of Newport, R.I., when their ship departs for the United
States,'' the Navy said.
   The Roberts was badly damaged by a mine on April 14 shortly
after completing a convoy operation for a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker.
Navy officials have said the frigate almost certainly would have
sunk had it not been for the performance of its crew.

   Domino's Pizza offered a $10,000 reward
Wednesday in the slayings of two employees who were found shot in
the head and dumped in a back room of the restaurant.
   A third employee was critically wounded in the apparent robbery
Tuesday night at the downtown take-out pizzeria.
   Police investigators say they have few clues and no witnesses.
   ``We're working as hard as we can following up on everything
we've got,'' said Deputy Police Chief Roland Wood. ``The trouble is
we don't have too much to go on right now.''
   An undetermined amount of money was found missing from the cash
register and there were no signs of forced entry into the store,
which was just two blocks from the police station, said Police
Chief James Gabbard.
   ``The way they were shot leads us to believe more than one
person was involved,'' he said.
   To help in the search for suspects, Domino's offered the reward
for information leading to a conviction, and sent four of its
crime-prevention investigators to the scene, said Ron Hingst, a
spokesman for the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based pizza chain.
   ``It's a tragedy when something like this happens because we try
to take every precaution,'' Hingst said. ``We ask that back
entrances be locked, we have a time-delayed safe and we don't keep
that much money around.''
   Investigators have not had a chance to interview victim Matthew
Boornoosh, 27, who was in surgery overnight for the head wound and
remained in critical condition Wednesday at Indian River Memorial
Hospital.
   Killed were Domino's management-trainee Bill Edwards, 27, and
his wife, Frances, 29, employed as a driver at the store, the chief
said.
   The bodies were discovered about midnight when Dan Lawing drove
to the store after waiting more than 45 minutes for the delivery of
his pizza.
   ``The front of the store was dark, but you could see lights on
in the back,'' said Lawing, 29. ``The door was open, so I just
poked my head in and yelled `hello' a couple of times. I knew
something was wrong, so I got the police.''
   ``My heart's still beating,'' said Lawing. ``I just keep
thinking that if I had gotten there just a couple of minutes
earlier, that could have been me shot.''

   The Tennessee Valley Authority voted
Wednesday to cut in half the number of top-level managers and
reorganize to resemble a private company.
   After the unanimous vote by the agency's three board members,
TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon said there will be layoffs but added
that it was not known how many because some managers would be
reassigned.
   He also declined to say how many ``top-level'' managers the
reorganization affects. The agency has more than a dozen offices
doing separate aspects of TVA work, such as power in general,
nuclear power, general counsel, natural resource and economic
development, and fertilizer research.
   ``A corporation the size of TVA must have a sound organizational
structure, one that can help ensure that TVA survives and prospers
in today's competitive business environment,'' Runyon said at a
news conference after the board meeting.
   The new organization goes into effect July 1. After that, it
will be clearer to agency officials which posts should be
eliminated and how many people will be laid off, he said.
   Currently, the agency has a dozen office managers who report to
General Manager William Willis. Willis reports to the board.
   Under the new structure, approved on the TVA's 55th birthday,
there are three main operating groups _ nuclear power, non-nuclear
power and resource development.
   As examples, Steve White, the TVA's current manager of the
nuclear power office, becomes senior vice president for nuclear
power. Willis becomes chief operating officer, and his former
position of general manager will be eliminated.
   The organizational change and recently announced layoffs at
nuclear power plants should help cut $300 million from agency
programs and personnel next year in an effort to keep electric
rates the same for three straight years, Runyon said.
   He said he did not know how much the reorganization could save
the utility.

   The admiral who heads the Navy's training
program has ordered a review of possibly risky procedures after a
sailor drowned during a rescue course, a Navy spokesman said
Wednesday.
   ``Are we coming too close to the edge, are we too close to the
margin?'' Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and
training, asked, according to his public affairs officer, Lt. Cmdr.
Dennis Hessler.
   Thunman, who is based at Pensacola, asked commanders of more
than 200 training activities throughout the Navy to respond to that
question, Hessler said.
   The Navy scheduled a preliminary hearing May 25 for five
instructors and the officer in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School at the Pensacola Naval Air Station on charges in the March 2
death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   Thunman also said the Navy began investigating the suspicious
nature of Mirecki's death immediately after he drowned in a pool.
He denied allegations by the sailor's family that the Navy failed
to react until pressured by them, their congressman and the media.
   Three separate investigations eventually were launched, one by
the training command, one by the Naval Investigative Service and
the third by the Navy's inspector general.
   The Investigative Service, a police agency, filed a dereliction
of duty charge against Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in charge of
the school, and involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit
battery charges against each of the five instructors.
   According to the charges, the instructor forced Mirecki into the
pool against his will and held his head under water and broke his
grip on a rack and safety rope before he died.
   The preliminary hearing will be held by an officers' panel,
which will make a recommendation on a possible court-martial to
Rear Adm. David Morris, chief of naval air training, a subordinate
of Thunman based in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   The defendants have been relieved of duty and activities at the
rescue school have been suspended.

   Hanging bricks around youngsters'
necks was just a gimmick so they'd remember their pencils and
supplies, school officials said Wednesday, but the state said the
school district should forget the whole practice.
   Four fifth- and sixth-graders were required to carry the bricks
in their hands or around their necks in late April if they
repeatedly forgot to take supplies from one class to another, said
Superintendent James Bogue.
   ``It was not a punishment. It was a gimmick _ an attempt to get
students to bring the proper supplies to school,'' Bogue said. ``We
needed some type of reminder.
   ``I would say it was unusual, but it wasn't unsafe,'' he added.
``It wasn't used to intimidate the children. I don't even consider
(the practice) to be bad.''
   The brick discipline worked, so officials in this district about
125 miles northeast of Houston stopped using it, Bogue said. But on
May 9, a parent called the Texas Education Agency to complain.
   ``We told the school that it was an inappropriate form of
discipline and to stop it,'' TEA spokeswoman Terri Moore said
Wednesday. ``But it's not illegal and it does not violate state
policies or rules.''
   No formal complaints, which would have led to an investigation,
were filed, she said.
   Bogue said the students were told they would have to carry the
bricks to class as reminders to take the proper supplies to the
next class.
   The students, one girl and three boys, had to have the bricks
with them for one day each, he said. They were told they could
either carry them or hang them around their necks.
   ``A string was provided, (but) they were not ordered to wear it
around their necks,'' Bogue said. ``It was long enough so it could
rest on the student's books.''
   Three white bricks were used, each 7\-inches long, 3{-inches
wide and 2\-inches thick. Bogue was not sure how much they weighed,
but said three holes in each made them lighter.
   One student had written, ``I forgot my books,'' on a brick. A
boy had autographed his brick and another brick appeared to have
the words ``I forgot my pencil'' on it, Bogue said.
   Among the students required to carry a brick was the 13-year-old
son of Houston firefighter James Barclay, who said his son has a
learning disability and takes the medication Ritalin, frequently
prescribed for hyperactive children.
   ``He's been diagnosed as being hyperactive and has mental
problems,'' the boy's grandmother, Annie M. Barclay said Wednesday.
``A child can't learn anything with a brick tied around his neck.
When he was in school, the other kids would call him and when he'd
turn, the brick would hit him in the face. It's pure humiliation.''
   But Bogue said the child, who lives with the grandmother in
Nacogdoches, has a behavior problem, not a learning disability, and
has been sent to the principal's office numerous times.
   Ms. Barclay said her son plans to attend a Central Heights
school board meeting Thursday to question the discipline.
   The superintendent said parents of two of the children involved
complained, while parents of the other two said they were not upset.
   ``It's just been blown way out of proportion,'' Bogue said. ``It
is unusual. I agree it would have been better if we had not done
it.''

   Israeli soldiers backed by
helicopters and bulldozers raided two Arab mountain villages
Wednesday. Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians surrounded the
force and one Arab was killed, the army said.
   Arab doctors and witnesses said 10 Arabs were wounded with live
ammunition, at least 20 received injuries from beatings and rubber
bullets, and hundreds were arrested.
   In a separate incident, troops shot and wounded four Arabs in
the marketplace in Nablus, the largest West Bank city, an army
spokesman said. He said the soldiers fired to disperse people who
had attacked them with stones.
   After the fighting in the two mountain villages, army officials
confirmed one dead and four wounded. They refused comment on
arrests or the reason for the raid, which came at the end of the
three-day Id el Fitr holiday marking the conclusion of Ramadan, the
Moslem holy month of fasting.
   The violence occurred a day after Israeli soldiers clashed with
Arab guerrillas who slipped into Israel from Jordan. One Arab was
wounded and captured, and two escaped. It was the 13th infiltration
or attempted infiltration in six months.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Palestinian guerrilla groups
have stepped up infiltration attempts to give a new impetus to the
23-week-old Arab uprising, which he said was ``dying down.''
   Since anti-occupation protests began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers have killed 191 Palestinians. Two
Israelis have also died. The lands were seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Rabin accused Jordan and Egypt of not doing enough to prevent
the infiltrations. Guerrillas have twice tried to enter Israel from
Egypt since Dec. 1.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind the authorities in Egypt and
Jordan are sometimes not doing everything that can be done to
prevent the (infiltrations),'' Rabin told Israel radio.
   Hundreds of Israeli soldiers moved into the neighboring villages
of Abwein and Arura, about 17 miles north of Jerusalem, before dawn
Wednesday.
   ``An Israeli force reached the villages as part of an initiated
action and was surrounded by hundreds of Arabs, some of whom
climbed nearby hills and attacked the force with a barrage of
stones and with slingshots,'' the army said.
   It said soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and a
commander shot live ammunition to quell the protests.
   In both villages, the fighting continued through the morning,
with helicopters dropping tear gas, witnesses said. Soldiers
eventually gained control and moved from house to house to search
for suspects, they said.
   In Arura, troops rounded up about 300 young men in a schoolyard,
said a 19-year-old Palestinian, speaking from his hospital bed in
nearby Ramallah.
   The teen-ager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
soldier kicked him in the head. The man's right eye was swollen
shut.
   In Abwein, soldiers made no arrests, apparently because most
youths fled into the hills, said Saam, 48, a local merchant who
would give only his first name.
   But in house-to-house searches, troops beat several women and
smashed furniture, Saam said.
   Both Abwein and Arura were what Palestinians call liberated
villages. As a sign of defiance against the army, the residents
have kept the villages sealed off with roadblocks, flown outlawed
Palestinian flags on rooftops and marked walls with pro-PLO
graffiti.
   Army officials noted that under current policy troops carry out
operations even in isolated villages ``to maintain order and show a
presence.''
   During a tour of Abwein, an Associated Press reporter saw Arabic
graffiti covered with white paint. Residents said soldiers had
forced them to whitewash the slogans.
   Bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks, and residents later showed a
reporter fragments of garden walls they said were knocked down.
   Villagers said soldiers also forced them to take down
Palestinian flags.
   A black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of Majdi
Youssef Hilal, the 16-year-old youth who was fatally shot in the
chest during the clashes.
   Doctors at Ramallah Hospital treated bullet wounds of nine
villagers, including five in serious condition. Dr. Yasser Obeid,
director of the hospital, said five others suffered serious beating
injuries.

   President Reagan said Wednesday the
battle against illegal drugs is in danger of being ``tripped up''
by political debate, and proposed a bipartisan task force to find a
consensus within 45 days on all aspects of the anti-narcotics
campaign.
   ``If we cannot remove the politics from drugs, how can we hope
to remove the drugs from our communities, workplaces and schools,''
Reagan said in a commencement address at the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy.
   Reagan's speech highlighted the growing importance of drugs as a
political issue in the presidential campaign and on Capitol Hill.
It has been a staple of Jesse Jackson's stump speeches, and is
raised with increasing frequency by fellow Democrat Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush.
   Moreover, there is sharp criticism _ from Republicans and
Democrats alike, particularly in Congress _ of an administration
offer to drop drug-trafficking indictments against Panamanian
military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega in return for Noriega's
agreement to relinquish power.
   Reagan, standing under gray, rain-threatening skies, addressed
159 white-uniformed, graduating cadets and their relatives from a
stage in front of the Thames River.
   ``Illegal drug use is the foremost concern in our country. And,
frankly, as I finish my final year in office and look ahead, I
worry that excessive drug politics might undermine effective drug
policy,'' the president said.
   ``If America's anti-drug effort gets tripped up in partisanship,
if we permit politics to determine policy, it will mean a disaster
for our future and that of our children,'' he added.
   Earlier, Reagan toured the Coast Guard cutter Vigorous and
inspected weapons and satchels of cocaine seized by federal
authorities.
   Over lunch with the crew, Reagan offered a new defense of
embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III when a reporter asked
about conservatives' unhappiness over the firing of Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland.
   ``I think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him
(Meese),'' Reagan said. ``So far they're all empty charges.''
   In his speech, Reagan did not mention the Noriega controversy.
He urged that Democrats and Republicans from the House and Senate
join with administration representatives ``to advance America's
unified response to the problem of illegal drug use.''
   Specifically, he said the proposed task force should produce a
report on issues such as how the military should be involved in the
campaign and whether the death penalty should be imposed when a
police officer or other people are killed as a resullt of drug
trafficking.
   ``Our task force should agree on solutions for every area of the
drug problem, from blocking supplies to curtailing demand, from
treatment to education to prosecution, from interdiction and
confiscation to eradication _ nothing should be overlooked or ruled
out,'' the president said.
   ``Our policy should be one of `zero tolerance' for illegal
drugs, and we are looking for solutions, not just a restatement of
the problem,'' he added.
   There appears to be a growing sentiment in Congress for
increasing the role of the military in interdicting drugs. Reagan
said the government should consider allowing governors greater use
of the National Guard in the effort.
   ``But one thing must be clear _ when it comes to the military,
let's give them a clear mission for specific situations,'' the
president said.
   He said he had directed Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to
ask experts inside and outside the government for suggestions on
how to use military resources to detect and prevent drug smuggling.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who was a guest on Air Force One
on the flight to his home state, agreed with Reagan that drugs are
becoming politicized.
   ``Things are getting a little crazy out there,'' Dodd said.
``People are making a feeding frenzy out of the issue. ... The
waters have been so choppy that if you offer an amendment on
anything, it'll carry.''
   But Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., who also accompanied Reagan on
his plane, said, ``You're not going to depoliticize the issue.
Every candidate's going to talk about it.''
   Likewise, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., scoffed at Reagan's
remarks.
   ``If we took action, there wouldn't be any necessity for
rhetoric,'' D'Amato said. ``It's naive for his speechwriters to
say, `Drop the political rhetoric,' if they are going to make a
deal with the scoundrel'' in Panama.
   As for the bipartisan commission, D'Amato said, ``It is
unfortunate that it took the Congress to drag the administration,
kicking and screaming, to the altar on doing something about
drugs.''
   In Washington, Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, a Republican
member of the House select committee on narcotics, said the
administration was not to blame alone for problems in the war on
drugs. He said the House Democratic leadership tried to block his
amendment to the defense authorization bill that would require the
military to seal U.S. borders against drug smugglers within 45 days
after enactment.
   The amendment passed 385-23, but its fate will be decided in a
House-Senate conference.
   Besides Hunter's amendment, the House and Senate, by large,
bipartisan majorities, have adopted several provisions in the past
two weeks urging Reagan and his administration to do more in the
war against drugs.
   The Senate, on an 83-6 vote, approved a plan giving the military
a new role in the anti-drug war, but one less far-reaching than
proposed by the House.
   Earlier this week, the Senate approved, 95-0, an amendment by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., ordered a halt to U.S. aid to Panama
until Noriega leaves.
   By 86-10, the Senate approved a resolution by Senate GOP leader
Bob Dole of Kansas opposing any deal with Noriega in which the drug
trafficking charges are dropped.

<HEAD>Expert Says 2.4 Million Ethiopians May Face Starvation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2.4 million Ethiopians living in two
northern provinces may be facing starvation because the Ethiopian
government has placed severe limits on deliveries of emergency food
provided by international donors, a U.S. government expert said
Wednesday.
   Dr. Frederick Machmer Jr., the top official of the Agency for
International Development in Ethiopia, said a food distribution
program run by Ethiopian authorities is reaching only about 780,000
persons in Eritrea and Tigray provinces _ less than a quarter of
their combined populations.
   Both provinces are wracked by drought and anti-government
rebellions. Government control in these provinces basically is
limited to their respective capitals and the authorities are not
allowing food deliveries beyond these areas, Machmer said.
   ``Every sign we have is that a bad situation is not getting any
better,'' Machmer told a small group of reporters.
   He said food availability is no problem, noting that
international donors have promised Ethiopia 1.4 million metric tons
of food for the rest of the year. In addition to restrictions on
food deliveries, the Ethiopian government ordered most foreign
relief workers out of the two provinces last month.
   Machmer said representatives of private organizations have
volunteered to deliver food by truck to the interior of the two
provinces but Ethiopian authorities have refused the offer,
contending they would be blamed if the volunteers were harmed.
   The United States has offered to donate just under 250,000
metric tons of food to Ethiopia. The Soviet Union, a close ally of
Ethiopia, has said it will donate 250,000 tons but has not
indicated it will pay for food transportation costs, Machmer said.

   Japanese police complained that Soviet
officials refuse to cooperate with investigators looking into a
fire aboard a docked Soviet liner Wednesday that killed at least 11
passengers.
   In Moscow, the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said that
besides the 11 confirmed dead, one person was missing and not
likely to be found alive.
   The fire broke out about 1:30 a.m. aboard the 4,870-ton
Priamurye, and smoke and flames trapped most of the victims as they
slept in their cabins on the lowest of three passenger decks.
   Izvestia said the blaze may have started in a passenger cabin on
the lower deck, but that the cause had not been established.
Japanese police said earlier that the fire was discovered in an
area above the engine room.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said in a brief dispatch
about the fire that some of the injured Soviets were in critical
condition.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said police were investigating
careless smoking or an engine-room problem as possible causes of
the fire.
   Norimasa Watanabe, chief of the Guard Rescue Department of the
Maritime Safety Agency in Osaka, told The Associated Press he
suspected the cause would be careless smoking or faulty wiring, but
that he wouldn't know until he had a chance to examine the ship on
Thursday.
   Police said the victims were all Soviet citizens who were on a
goodwill visit to Japan sponsored by the Communist Youth League. It
took 18 hours to extinguish the blaze, and the ship was left
blackened and listing at the Osaka docks.
   Yoshihide Yasuda, spokesman for Osaka Prefectural Police, said
police wanted to question the Soviets about the blaze, but Soviet
consular officials refused to sign papers permitting it.
   ``They think it's not important to check what happened, and they
even think it's strange that we want to investigate,'' Yasuda told
a news conference.
   Yasada said the fire department and the Maritime Safety Agency
would launch a formal investigation Thursday.
   Yasuda said a second Soviet ship was arriving at this port in
western Japan on Friday to take home survivors from the 295
passengers and 129 crew members aboard the Priamurye. He said it
would not be possible to keep them from leaving.
   In 1982, police were unable to complete investigation of a fire
on a Soviet ship in the port of Yokohama for the same reason,
Yasuda said. No one was killed in the 1982 fire.
   Yasuda said officials planned to question the ship's captain,
Aleksandr Yerastov, 10 passengers who witnessed the blaze and 15
crew members employed as security personnel.
   Yasuda said police and firefighters had been through the gutted
ship in a preliminary probe, but the Soviets had asked them not to
enter the engine room.
   The 406-foot-long Priamurye had sailed from Vladivostok on May 7
and had stopped in Otaru, on the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido, and in Tokyo before arriving in Osaka Tuesday.
   Yasuda said 15 people remained hospitalized with burns and smoke
inhalation, and 20 others were treated and released.
   Survivors were taken first to a junior high school gymnasium
near the port and then to hotels.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry offered condolences to Soviet
Ambassador Nikolai Soloviev. Soloviev said he thanked Japan for its
help.
   Izvestia said that among the passengers were large delegations
from the Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Moldavia, as well as
from Moscow.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami
demanded Wednesday that a House impeachment panel dismiss
misconduct allegations brought by fellow judges after his acquittal
on bribery conspiracy charges five years ago.
   ``I am not guilty, but I am not free,'' Hastings said in his
impassioned plea at the start of impeachment hearings by a House
Judiciary subcommittee whose chairman suggested the case against
Florida's first black federal judge might be racially and
politically motivated.
   Hastings, who was nominated for the federal bench by President
Carter in 1979, was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring to solicit a
$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers in exchange for a
promise of lenient sentences.
   But a special five-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta concluded after a 3{-year investigation that
there was ``clear and convincing evidence'' that Hastings had
engaged in a bribery conspiracy and tried to conceal it by lying
under oath and fabricating evidence at his highly publicized trial
in Miami.
   The panel's 381-page report was endorsed unanimously by the
27-member Judicial Conference of the United States, the chief
policymaking body of the federal judiciary. The conference
forwarded the report to the House leadership with the conclusion
that ``consideration of impeachment may be warranted.''
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, after
conducting its own intensive investigation for more than a year,
opened public hearings Wednesday by allowing Hastings to deliver a
sworn statement.
   Hastings said he was the first federal judge in U.S. history to
be threatened with impeachment after his acquittal of criminal
charges.
   ``They found me not guilty of crimes I never committed,'' he
said.
   ``Let me make it very, very clear,'' Hastings said. ``I have not
received a bribe. I have not obstructed justice. And I have not
betrayed the integrity of the high office that I hold.''
   His voice rising, Hastings declared:
   ``I am not guilty, but I am not free. And I ask you in the name
of decency, in the name of justice, in the name of the American
jury system ... I ask you in the name of the American way of life,
I beg you, I beseech you, I implore you _ hell no, I tell you and I
demand of you that you set me free!''
   The subcommittee then heard from New York lawyer John Doar, a
former assistant U.S. attorney general in the Johnson
administration, who reviewed the massive evidence used in the
investigation he conducted for the appellate panel that charged
Hastings with judicial misconduct.
   Subcommittee members listened to a series of secretly taped
conversations and telephone calls in September and October 1981
involving Washington lawyer William A. Borders and an FBI
undercover agent posing as racketeer Frank Romano.
   Borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges to
arrange the alleged bribe from Romano and his brother, Thomas.
   Doar said one taped telephone call between Borders and Hastings,
also played for the subcommittee, was a coded conversation that
concerned the bribery transaction and whether the person they
thought was Frank Romano had actually made an initial $25,000 down
payment.
   After its fact-finding hearings, the panel must decide whether
to recommend impeachment to the full Judiciary Committee. If the
committee approves articles of impeachment against Hastings, they
must be submitted to a House floor vote.
   If the House impeaches Hastings, which would be tantamount to an
indictment, a Senate trial would be held. A two-thirds majority of
senators would be required to convict Hastings of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' and force his removal from the federal bench.
   Hastings' lawyers charged in a statement that Doar was an
incompetent witness who was relying on hearsay information. They
also alleged that the appellate panel's report includes
``incomplete, inaccurate and inadmissible evidence'' that is
insufficient to produce a conviction at any Senate impeachment
trial.
   ``The House has never in its 200-year history used its
impeachment powers to inquire into charges gainst a federal judge
that a jury had rejected after a full trial,'' the lawyers said.
   The racial and political overtones of the impeachment inquiry
were cited by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the subcommittee
chairman, as soon as he opened the hearing.
   Conyers said the proceedings were ``exceedingly difficult and
trying'' because Hastings had already been acquitted by a trial
jury and because he is a leader of the black community in Florida.
   Conyers, who is black, said his subcommittee had ``taken
cognizance of racially motivated conduct in this country for many,
many years, particularly in the criminal justice system.''
   He said the federal judiciary had become ``conservatized and in
some instances politicized'' during the Reagan administration. ``We
are not unaware of or naive about the troubling matters that hover
over this particular hearing today,'' he said.
   But Rep. George Gekas of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the
panel, countered that ``never has there been a hint ... that any
part of this inquiry was based on racial motivations.'' He offered
Hastings assurances that the panel would be ``unmotivated by
anything but the search for truth.''

<HEAD>Japan, West Germany, Replace U.S. as Top Traders With South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and West Germany have replaced the
United States as top traders with South Africa, according to a
study from the General Accounting Office.
   The GAO, which conducts investigations for Congress, reports a
small increase in U.S. lending to South Africa early last year.
   The office says that in recent years, South Africa has stopped
publishing details of its foreign trade and that older figures may
not be accurate because of a long history of sanctions. Sanctions,
both official and private, have been imposed on South Africa from
abroad because of its race policies.
   The GAO put together figures for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., using other sources,
including the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund and
private organizations.
   The report, dated April 29, was made available to the media this
week. It gives percentages rather than actual dollar values for
trade.
   It shows that West Germany took the place of the United States
as South Africa's leading supplier in 1984, providing 20.4 percent
of South Africa's imports to 19.7 percent for the United States. By
the first six months of 1987, the German proportion had risen to
25.4 percent, Japan's to 18 percent, Britain's to 15.8. The United
States was in fourth place with 13.4 percent.
   The United States continued as South Africa's best customer
until the first half of 1987, the latest period for which the study
has figures. But in those six months Japan bought 23.8 percent of
South Africa's exports, with Italy taking 17.4 percent and the
United States 12.6 percent.
   According to the report, there are conflicting views and little
evidence about South African efforts to avoid sanctions. Although
world trade increased substantially in the five years covered,
South Africa's trade with 24 major countries decreased.
   Comparing the first half of each year from 1982 through 1987, it
finds that South African exports dropped to $5.2 billion from $5.6
billion; imports by South Africa decreased to $4.4 billion from
$6.4 billion.
   ``An economist and U.S. embassy personnel in South Africa state
that South Africa has no need to extensively use sanction-busting
activities because the sanctions have not had a substantially
adverse effect on the economy,'' the report says.
   It quotes the Shipping Research Bureau, a private organization,
as saying that despite embargoes, South Africa can still get most
of the oil it needs, at a higher price.
   ``According to the bureau, most of South Africa's oil comes from
Persian Gulf countries that sell the oil to independent oil
traders, who disguise by false documentation that the oil is being
shipped to South Africa,'' it adds.
   ``The bureau said it had notified these oil producing countries
that the independent traders they are dealing with ship some of
their oil to South Africa, but the countries continue to deal with
South Africa.''
   On lending to South Africa, the report uses information from the
California-Nevada Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility.
It reports that international lending, including U.S. lending,. to
South Africa had declined at the end of 1986.
   Of a total $22.6 billion borrowed by South Africa, banks in
Britain accounted for $3.6 billion, those in the United States for
$3 billion, West Germany for $1.9 billion and Switzerland for $1.8
billion.
   U.S. lending increased marginally in the first six months of
1987 to just over $3 billion, the report says, without giving
precise figures.
   ``In the light of the ban on most forms of new U.S. lending that
took effect in mid-November 1986, we have not been able to explain
this small increase,'' the report says.
   New U.S. investment in South African long-term securities has
decreased since 1985 _ $36 million worth in 1986 and $13 million
last year _ despite an increase of $7 million in purchases by
Americans of South African bonds.
   The number of U.S. companies withdrawing from South Africa rose
from 40 in 1985 to 55 in 1987. In the first four months of this
year, there were only four withdrawals, however. These figures came
from the U.S. Investor Responsibility Research Center, a private
group.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued
a warning Wednesday that small parts on an umbrella stroller may
come out and choke small children who try to swallow them.
   The 15,000 potentially hazardous strollers were identified as
model 1601 PRT strollers that were sold between August 1986 and
March 1987 at Service Merchandise stores.
   The strollers are navy blue with red trim. Each stroller has 16
tube end plugs that may dislodge and choke a small child who tries
to swallow the plugs, the CPSC said.
   ``In addition, when the plugs are removed, the exposed metal
tube ends could have sharp edges,'' the commission said.
   Parents using the strollers ``should stop using them and
immediately contact Service Merchandise for a modification kit,''
it said.
   The commission said it had received no reports of small children
being injured as a result of the plugs or sharp edges, but the
Nashville-based Service Merchandise Co. is voluntarily offering the
modification kits to customers at no charge.
   To get the kit, consumers should call 1-800-251-1389. Tennessee
residents should call 1-800-251-1212.

<HEAD>EPA Official Issues Recommendation In North Carolina Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency should
back away from its attempt to strip North Carolina of the right to
operate its own hazardous waste disposal program, according to a
recommendation to EPA's administrator.
   ``The use of program withdrawal authorities under (federal
hazardous waste law) is not the most effective means'' to make sure
waste facilities are soundly operated, said J. Winston Porter,
assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, in
a letter to Administrator Lee M. Thomas.
   Porter's letter was dated Monday and obtained Wednesday by The
Associated Press.
   ``This is good news,'' said Velma Smith of the Environmental
Policy Institute, a Washington-based lobbying organization for
environmental causes that had been supporting North Carolina. ``You
have made my day.''
   Porter said EPA should use its authority under the ``Superfund''
waste dump cleanup law ``as the primary vehicle for addressing
capacity issues.''
   A 1986 amendment to the Superfund law requires states to show
that they have plans for handling all the toxic waste they
generate, at the risk of losing state grants under the Superfund
program.
   ``I would like for us to work cooperatively with the states to
develop necessary waste management capacity, and to make it clear
that the required (Superfund) capacity certification will be
considered very seriously by EPA,'' Porter wrote.
   Porter's letter reported findings of a special agency committee
considering the dispute with North Carolina, together with Porter's
own recommendations. The task force ``has not yet reached a
consensus recommendation'' but should do so within two weeks, he
said.
   The North Carolina dispute arose when GSX Corp. sought to put a
waste treatment plant on the Lumber River upstream of Lumberton,
whose 10,000 citizens get their drinking water from the stream.
   State law requires that any stream used for drinking water and
receiving discharge from such a plant dilute the discharge by a
factor of 1,000.
   Compliance would limit the plant to discharing 72,000 gallons a
day at the planned location. It had planned to discharge 500,000.
   EPA officials contended the state law in effect limited capacity
in such a way as to prevent other states from using the plant and
in effect to keep the plant from being built at all. Some officials
were reported as saying the agency wanted in effect to make an
example of North Carolina to warn other states against letting
parochial concerns hamper interstate commerce.
   State officials denied it, and Ms. Smith said North Carolina's
law would permit a plant of unlimited size 30 miles downstream.
   An EPA administrative law judge had been scheduled to hear the
agency's attempt to revoke North Carolina's authority next month.
   Federal hazardous waste law encourages states to operate their
own disposal programs under EPA oversight. State programs must be
``consistent'' with federal law and may be ``more stringent.''
   One of the findings of the task force reported by Porter was
that ``it will be increasingly difficult for EPA to determine the
difference between a state's `consistency' with the national
(waste) programs and the state's ability to be `more stringent'
than the national program.''

<HEAD>Jackson Campaign Complains To Party Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Jesse Jackson's campaign on Wednesday fired a salvo
in his bid to change what he considers the Democratic Party's
unfair system of delegate selection, writing to party chief Paul
Kirk that ``the vote of the people is distorted'' by the current
process.
   A letter signed by Jackson's campaign chief Willie Brown and
Jackson adviser Rep. Walter Fauntroy of Washington, urged Kirk to
consider the ``moral and political questions raised'' in an
attached delegate analysis compiled by Jackson's delegate counter
Steve Cobble.
   The letter was dated May 17 and copies were sent to Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis, who has benefitted from the system
Jackson is protesting, and to House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   Jackson principally objects to the role of the so-called super
delegates, who are delegates by virtue of their elected offices of
party positions, because their allegiance is not related to the
popular vote. Most of them have been siding with Dukakis.
   Brown and other Jackson representatives have met with Kirk to
urge a more proportional system of allocating super delegates, but
have not decided whether to mount an official challenge at the
summer nominating convention in Atlanta, aides have said.
   ``As of now it is an appeal to conscience and to fairness,''
said Ron Brown, who is heading Jackson's convention team. He said
``all options are open'' on the matter of an official challenge,
but also said there are no plans to call for retroactive changes in
the party rules.
   Dukakis said Wednesday in Boston that he does not anticipate ``a
fight with Mr. Jackson.''
   ``I think Jesse has a perfect right to voice criticism of
whatever he chooses to criticize,'' he said, before repeating his
position that Jackson knew the delegate selection rules when he
entered the race.
   The Cobble analysis said Dukakis has 61 percent more delegates
than Jackson in early May, at a time that the two were separated by
a a popular vote margin of less than 30 percent, according to
counts by news organizations.
   Cobble cited four reasons for the inequity:
   _ In Puerto Rico, Jackson won the nonbinding popular vote but in
an internal political power war, the Puerto Rico governor awareded
all the island's 51 delegates to Dukakis.
   _ Super delegates have flocked to Dukakis rather than dividing
themselves up in a way that would more accurately reflect the
popular vote.
   ``The super delegates do not have to coronate a winner. They
could act on behalf of fairness. There is nothing in the rules
which mandates a lemming-like rush to the frontrunner's side,
particularly when he is in reality so far short of 2,081 votes,''
the number needed to secure the Democratic presidential nomination,
the letter said.
   The cover letter from Willie Brown and Fauntroy states: ``The
`party of fairness' is not well serviced in the candidate receiving
30 percent of the 1988 primary and caucus vote is virtually
excluded from the support of super delegates. The Democratic Party
is not well served if the vote of the people is distorted once the
polls are closed.''
   _ Direct election states, in which voters elect delegates on the
ballot rather than having the delegates awarded proportionately
based on how a candidate did in each district, have worked against
Jackson. In Maryland, according to Cobble's memo, Jackson would
have received 26 delegates under a proportional representation
system, but in the direct election, he got 20. Similar inequities
were evidenced in the direct election states of Illinois and
Pennsylvania, he wrote.
   _ The use of ``bonus elections'' in some states, has worked to
Dukakis' advantage and Jackson's disadvantage. In those states, the
first delegate in each district is awarded to the person who won
the district. Those states have cost Jackson some 22 to 27
delegates, while Dukakis gained 20 to 25, the letter said.
   If all of the Jackson objections were fixed, according to
Cobble, Dukakis' delegate lead of 562 on May 6 would have dropped
to a lead of 260.
   That would have put Dukakis in a different situation than ``the
coronation that is taking place today,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Questran Recall Doesn't Apply to Supplies in Patient Hands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bristol Laboratories spokesman said
Wednesday that the voluntary recall of certain batches of the
cholesterol-lowering drug Questran does not apply to supplies
already in patients' hands.
   The company announced the recall after it learned that one of
the ingredients in the drug may have been contaminated by
agricultural chemicals.
   Scott Litherland, a spokesman for Bristol Laboratories, said the
low levels of these chemicals present in some batches of the drug
did not pose a health threat and that patients should continue
taking the medication.
   Litherland said the recall only involves certain Questran
supplies at the wholesale and retail level but not medication that

<HEAD>Groups Seek Public Accounting of Nuclear Weapons Material
Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department should be required to
justify in public its need to produce nuclear weapons material, a
coalition of community groups said Wednesday.
   ``Citizens in this country should be able to go through the
accounting ... to see whether it's worth it,'' said Tim Connor,
spokesman for one group, the Hanford Education Action League of
Spokane, Wash.
   The public accounting proposition headed a list of eight
principles backed by Connor's group and 13 others as a ``bill of
rights'' that should govern efforts to clean up DOE weapons plants.
   Though the coalition includes some groups that ordinarily oppose
nuclear weapons, Connor said, ``This is not a ban-the-bomb
statement.''
   To illustrate the diversity of views represented in the
coalition, Connor said, ``There is a good case to be made, in my
view, for a new production reactor for tritium production.''
   In July, the department is expected to propose development of a
new reactor to produce tritium for weapons. Tritium decays in
storage and must be refreshed in stockpiled weapons.
   The sole active tritium reactor, at the Savannah River Plant in
South Carolina, is operating at half power because of safety
concerns.
   The department has conceded that the nation is ``awash'' in
plutonium, the other weapons material, from previous production and
recycling of old weapons. It is putting a plutonium reactor at the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state on standby.
   Connor appeared at a news conference sponsored by The
Environmental Policy Institute, a Washington-based lobbying
organization for environmentalist causes. Another speaker, Lisa
Crawford of Fernald Residents for Safety and Health, said, ``We
have never once said shut the facility down. We have said clean it
up and operate it safely.''
   Her group concerns itself with the department's plant in
Fernald, Ohio.
   The other points in the coalition's ``bill of rights'' called
for independent licensing of new plants and indepedent safety
regulation; public participation in licensing; ending of current
exemptions and compliance with all federal and state environmental
laws; a federal commitment to pay all cleanup costs; long-term
health studies of nearby residents; job retraining for displaced
workers when plants close; and a pledge that production decisions
will not be made for pork-barrel purposes.
   Many of these points are addressed in bills in Congress, but the
coalition is not supporting a specific bill. ``Bits and pieces'' of
each deserve support, Connor said.
   The House has approved a provision for a safety oversight board
within the Energy Department, and spokesman Will Callicott said the
department was not opposing it. He would not comment on the call
for public accounting.
   Other groups participating Wednesday were: Greenpeace; American
Friends Service Committee; Puget Sound SANE, Seattle; Palouse
Clearwater Hanford Watch, Moscow, Idaho; Ohio Public Interest
Campaign, Cincinnati; Northwest Nuclear Safety Campaign, Seattle;
Snake River Alliance, Ketchum, Idaho; Energy Research Foundation,
Columbia, S.C.; Colorado Peace Network, Denver; Coalition for Safe
Power, Portland, Ore.; and Citizens Against Rocky Flats
Contamination, Denver.

   The Secret Service, in keeping with its name,
doesn't like to discuss the details or frequency of threats against
Jesse Jackson, Michael Dukakis or George Bush. Neither do the
candidates and their staffs.
   Yet the specter of the candidate as a crackpot's target is a
fact of politics in America. And as a charismatic candidate, and a
black man with a ground-breaking presidential candidacy, Jackson
has become a magnet for death threats.
   ``Just like the Kennedys have had to wrestle long and hard with
running for president because of the risk, I have had to do the
same thing,'' Jackson once said.
   By his own count, Jackson was the object of 314 recorded threats
on his life during his 1984 presidential campaign. In 14 of those
cases, people were arrested.
   Jackson's campaign press secretary, Delmarie Cobb, said the
Secret Service would not give the number of threats against him for
this campaign. She said early Wednesday she had understood from
another staff member that there were at least 100, but later said
she could not confirm the figure, and that the Secret Service had
subsequently told her the number was wrong.
   Cobb quoted Jackson as saying that threats against him in 1984
were more numerous than for any candidate, and that ``Of course,
they're running high now.''
   Federal agents in St. Louis said this week they had arrested a
self-described white supremacist and his wife on charges of
conspiring to kill or harm Jackson. Londell Williams, 30, of
Washington, Mo., and his wife Tammy, 26, were being held without
bond.
   Authorities recovered a semiautomatic rifle said to belong to
the couple. An agent quoted Williams as saying Jackson was
``getting too close to being president of the United States.''
   Jackson, in California, thanked the Secret Service on Wednesday
and said, ``We will not surrender to the dream-busters.''
   Dukakis, who for a long time spurned Secret Service protection,
praised the agency as well and acknowledged the threats he has
received.
   ``All of us in public life have these threats,'' Dukakis said.
``I've had them, not recently to the best of my knowledge. These
things happen to you.''
   The Secret Service has been protecting most major presidential
candidates since ordered by Congress following the assassination of
Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, on the night he won California's
Democratic primary.
   Secret Service spokesman William J. Corbett said it is against
agency policy to discuss the protection accorded any of the
candidates, the methods that are used, or the nature of threats.
   ``The more hype we put on it, the more potential there is to
plant the seed in other people's mind,'' he said. ``We go out of
our way to downplay it.''
   He said the Secret Service works closely with other federal
agencies, and with state and local police, to monitor any potential
threats, including the possible threat posed by terrorists
overseas. While only a few threats result in arrests, all are
viewed with seriousness and are pursued, he said.
   ``Some of them fizzle out, luckily, and others don't, and we
keep monitoring to see what the potential is,'' Corbett said.
   The crowded 1988 presidential field, which earlier boasted more
than a dozen major party candidates, forced the Secret Service to
borrow agents from other Treasury Department agencies _ Customs,
Internal Revenue Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   Dukakis did not accept agents until last week, preferring the
freedom of movement and ability to circulate with crowds. He
resisted the urgings of some on his staff, and even his wife Kitty,
to accept protection sooner.
   ``I think Dukakis felt he wanted to run as close a campaign as
he could to the voters, and felt comfortable with the kind of
support he was getting form local police as he traveled,'' said
Leslie Dach, Dukakis' communications director.
   ``He tries to live as much of a private life as he can, and in
order for the Service to do their job it takes a bit away from
that. Dukakis likes to be able to go home and be by himself and
enjoy his neighborhood, and I think that was a large part of it,''
Dach said.
   Other candidates, particularly those struggling early in the
race, welcomed the protection. It meant a traveling entourage of
agents, as few as four or as many as nine or 10. It lends an air of
professionalism to a campaign and ``it helps to pay for the
airplane,'' as former Democratic candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
once quipped.
   The government pays for each agent's seat on a candidate's
chartered plane.
   But the seriousness of the duty is often apparent.
   During the New York primary campaign, agents remained extremely
close to Jackson at all times. One agent confided he would be
greatly relieved when the campaign left the state.
   As with the president, the thought that some violent act could
erupt at any moment is always present with a presidential candidate
and his entourage.
   ``My mother tells me not to stand too close to Jackson,'' his
spokeswoman, Cobb, said _ adding that it was meant in a somewhat
joking way.
   ``You have to basically believe that nothing's going to
happen,'' she said. ``You can't operate in fear.''
   ``There are certain givens I must face every day,'' Jackson told
the Atlanta Constitution in an interview. ``Anxiety and fear can
become paralyzing. I cannot let myself become paralyzed with morbid
thoughts.''

<HEAD>Smoke-Hating Shultz Accepted Cigarette Boxes as Gifts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who hates
smoking so much he outlawed it on his official flights, accepted
gifts of silver cigarette boxes from leaders in India, France,
Guatemala and Mexico last year, according to a list issued
Wednesday.
   The secretary also kept caviar, chocolates, a tea set and a
lacquered painting, worth $175 in all, from Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The gifts were on Shultz's annual financial disclosure
statement, which gives a bare-bones outline of assets and income,
plus his $99,030 salary as a cabinet officer.
   A blind trust established for Shultz when he took office July
1982 generated more than $100,000 in income in 1987; how much more,
he is not required to disclose under the rules of the Office of
Government Ethics. The trust executed purchases and sales totaling
more than $250,000 during the year.
   For most of his adult life, Shultz has been either a college
professor or government official, but during the Ford and Carter
presidencies and in the beginning of President Reagan's first term,
he was a high-ranking executive of the Bechtel Group, Inc., one of
the world's largest construction companies.
   All gifts from foreigners worth more than $100 must be reported
and anything over $180 must be turned in to the government.
   Besides all those cigarette boxes, Shultz kept six pounds of
coffee from Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, four yards of silk
from the wife of the South Korean ambassador, and a Danish ham from
the Danish foreign minister.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police sent Shultz a wall mounting,
titled ``Mounties.''
   Shultz kept more gifts from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze than from any other single source, which was not
surprising, considering the number of times they met during a year
of superpower summitry.
   The gifts included a book on Russian churches, a candle holder
``with some sort of semiprecious stone adornment,'' a small pill
box, two other boxes, a commemorative medal, vodka, dolls, a
lacquered picture and a soapstone necklace, the report said.
   Many leaders gave Shultz books. Israeli foreign minister Shimon
Peres sent a tome titled ``The Jewish People, 4,000 Years of
Survival,'' and Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte gave his
autobiography, ``My Story.''
   The costliest gifts Shultz accepted from American sources in
1987 were $633 in tennis clothes and equipment from the Community
Foundation of Greater Washington, which runs a charity-raising
celebrity tennis tournament Shultz plays in.
   Shultz certified that the statements in the form were ``true,
complete and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief,'' but
whoever filled in the secretary's telephone number in the heading
got it wrong.
   The State Department changed the numbers on most of its phones
in 1986, and Shultz's form, signed May 4, 1988, had the old digits.
Any member of the public who sees the form and calls Shultz at the
number on the form will hear a recording that says, ``you have
reached a disconnected U.S. government number.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent attacks on the electric
power grid by leftist rebels have put seven of the 19 distribution
lines out of service and aggravated supply problems created by
drought, officials said Wednesday.
   Orlando Quiteno, public relations director of the state-run
Lempa River Hydrolectric Executive Commission, said in a telephone
interview about 40 percent of the nation has been affected by the
sabotage.
   Government reports show 75 percent of San Salvador and five of
the 14 provinces have been without service since Monday. An
emergency rationing system already in effect has been tightened
elsewhere.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who
began fighting U.S.-supported governments 8{ years ago, said
Tuesday they had mobilized ``dozens of units of militia and
saboteurs throughout the national territory.''
   A broadcast by clandestine Radio Venceremos said the campaign
was ``placing the Christian Democratic military dictatorship in the
worst energy crisis of the war.''
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, operations director for the joint chiefs
of staff, told reporters the military command was studying ways to
increase security for the nearly 500 miles of primary cables in the
distribution system.
   The power grid has been a prime target in the guerrila program
of economic sabotage. Official reports say more than 2,000 attacks
since 1980 have done at least $51 million in damage.
   Quiteno said that, before the latest attacks, the power company
had begun a rotating system of daily four-hour power cuts because
of low water levels in reservoirs and a delay in the arrival of the
rainy season, which normally begins in May.
   An attack May 11 on the November 5th Dam in northern El Salvador
forced daily cuts of six to eight hours, he said.
   Raiders destroyed five transformers and a central control board
at the dam 50 miles north of San Salvador. Reports indicate the
generating facility will be down for two months and damage exceeds
$500,000.

<TEXT>
   Jewish leaders said Tuesday there are signs in Italy
of the same anti-Semitism that preceded enactment of racial laws 50
years ago by Benito Mussolini's fascist government.
   Chief Rabbi Elio Toaff and Jacob Sabban, president of the Jewish
community, told reporters it ``could be the prelude of things much
more vile, and not only against the Jews.''
   Toaff and Sabban accused the media of publishing reports from
the Middle East that compare Israelis to Nazis because of the
Israelis' policies toward Palestinians in the occupied territories.
They displayed bundles of threatening letters and dozens of photos
of swastikas painted on walls in Rome.
   They said an old man who survived Auschwitz was asked by a
doctor who saw the camp number tattooed on his arm: ``How many
Palestinians have you killed today in your extermination camps?''
   A Jewish university student was forced to remove the Star of
David he wore on a chain around his neck, the two men said.
   ``It seems to me the return of the climate that preceded, 50
years ago, the approval of the racial laws by the fascist regime,''
Toaff declared.
   Both said ``a deterioration of the value of civilization'' was
illustrated by recent acts of intolerance against Gypsies and
people of other races.
   Toaff said criticism of Israel is legitimate but journalists
should be careful not to use terminology that encourages
anti-Semitism. He said threats to the Jewish community made
recently had the pretext of condemning acts by Israel.

   Police rounded up at least 13
people Wednesday in a surprise airport raid conducted during a
follow-up investigation of drug smuggling.
   Rigoberto Regalado Lara, Honduran ambassador to Panama and
half-brother of the armed forces chief, was arrested Sunday on
arrival in Florida from Tegucigalpa and charged with trying to
smuggle nearly 26 pounds of cocaine into the United States in his
luggage.
   Police sources said privately the purpose of Wednesday's raid at
Toncontin International Airport was to determine how drugs could be
carried out of Honduras. They said those detained probably would be
interrogated and released.
   Retired Gen. Oswaldo Lopez Arellano, president of the Honduran
airline TAN-Sahsa, said he was advised of the raid in advance. He
said all those picked up had access to the baggage-handling and
runway areas.
   The airline's labor union declared an immediate protest strike,
forcing suspension of TAN-Sahsa's international flights.
   Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez told reporters Tuesday his
half-brother also would be prosecuted in this country. ``The law is
the same for everyone and, independently of the ruling in the
United States, we also will judge him in Honduras,'' he said.
   Regalado Lara, 49, a career military officer, was suspended as
ambassador after the arrest. He is being held without bond in
Miami, pending trial.

   Two grenade explosions shattered windows
Wednesday at the home of a Soviet journalist who earlier received a
threat from a rightist terrorist squad.
   No one was injured.
   Alejandro Trouchine, who opened an office of the Soviet news
agency Tass in the capital in January, said two grenades exploded
at 2:20 a.m. (4:20 a.m. EDT), damaging the door of the house and
his car.
   He said the blasts broke windows in his home, where he also has
his office, and in neighboring houses.
   Trouchine said he and his wife Elena were at home. Their
12-year-old son Eugenio left two weeks ago for Moscow, he said.
   He said he received a statement in the mail on May 9, signed by
Mano Blanca (White Hand), one of the main right-wing terrorist
squads active from the mid-1960s until around 1980.
   It was a copy of a communique dated April 14 that was published
last month in local newspapers. The communique also threatened
representatives of an exiled opposition organization who visited
Guatemala in April.
   ``The Mano Blanca rises again in the combative life of
Guatemala, raises its flags of western Christian civilization
against the new Marxist avalanche that keeps company with two
Communist espionage agencies, Tass and Prensa Latina, for whom we
have a surprise at the right opportunity,'' it read.
   Prensa Latina is the Cuban government news agency.
   A recent communique purportedly from another underground
rightist group, called Officials from the Mountains, also mentioned
the two news agencies in a barrage of accusations of leftist and
illegal activity against President Vinicio Cerezo and Defense
Minister Hector Gramajo.
   That communique was read by a local television news director on
his program two weeks before a coup attempt which the government
has blamed on a group of civilians and military officers.
   Five civilians and six military officers have been charged with
rebellion in connection with the coup attempt last week.
   Cerezo took office Jan. 14, 1986, as the first civilian
president since 1970.
   Mano Blanca has claimed responsibility for bombings and
assassinations of people it claimed were communists.
   A leftist insurgency has operated in Guatemala for more than a
quarter century.

   A government investigating commission
concluded Wednesday that two sports organizations were remiss in
the stadium stampede that killed more than 70 fans at a soccer
match in Katmandu on March 12.
   Many in the crowd that day accused officials of failing to open
locked stadium doors and of failing to control the crowd when a
sudden hailstorm caused spectators to panic.
   The commission report listed the hailstorm as the main cause of
the stampede, but said the All-Nepal Football (Soccer) Association
and the National Sports Council failed to handle the incident
properly.
   The commission said preparations by the football association,
organizers of the match, for exit routes from the downtown National
Stadium were ``not found to be satisfactory.''
   It said the Sports Council failed to keep stadium gates in a
proper state during the match and that Sports Council security
personnel failed to take appropriate actions during the emergency.
   The stadium was nearly filled to capacity for the final game in
a series between a national cigarette factory team and a squad from
Bangladesh.
   Spectators raced toward locked exit doors when the hailstorm
burst, with more than 70 people killed and about 100 injured in the
stampede.
   Most of the dead were crushed or trampled. Others were
suffocated.

<HEAD>Rain Soaks East Coast, Scattered Showers in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A stubborn low pressure system stalled over eastern Virginia
Wednesday, bringing rain all day from southern New England to the
North Carolina coast.
   The rain extended west into the upper Ohio Valley, but was
heaviest over parts of central and eastern Virgina and eastern
North Carolina, where thunderstorm watches were issued for the
evening.
   Flash flood watches were in effect until early Thursday for
parts of central Pennsylvania and the Laurel Mountains.
   Newark, N.J.'s .65 inches of rain Wednesday set a rainfall
record for the date, breaking the mark of .63 set in 1963.
   Showers also were widely scattered from the central Missouri
Valley into parts of the central Rockies. Thunderstorms were dotted
across western and northeast Nebraska during the morning and later
formed over north-central Iowa. Light showers also were scattered
from Wyoming through northern New Mexico into the high Plains from
South Dakota into northwest Kansas.
   The rest of the nation enjoyed pleasant weather, with cloudy
skies over most of the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 96 degrees at Thermal, Calif.
The morning low for the nation was 26 degrees at Marquette, Mich.,
and Hibbing, Minn.
   Thursday's forecast called for more rain from the upper Ohio
Valley through southern and central New England into the Middle
Atlantic states. Thunderstorms should be scattered across the upper
Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic Coast, and from the upper Mississippi
Valley through the central Missouri Valley into the central and
southern high Plains and along the east slopes of the Colorado
Rockies.
   High temperatures should be in the 70s or 80s across most of the
nation, dipping into the 60s across northern and western Washington
into northern Idaho, over northern Minnesota and from eastern parts
of the Ohio Valley through the central Appalachians into much of
the New England. Highs should reach into the 90s from the valleys
of California into the desert Southwest and from the central Gulf
Coast region through eastern and central Texas into the Rio Grande
Valley.

<HEAD>Utah Officials Say Army Tests Violated Air Pollution Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army apparently violated Utah law by
conducting open-air tests of new chemical weapon simulants last
year without first obtaining air pollution permits, state officials
say.
   A spokeswoman for Dugway Proving Ground denied any laws were
broken, saying the Army believed that state-approved variances
allowing use of smoke-causing chemicals would also permit testing
of the new chemical arms.
   Records show the Army conducted up to 57 open-air tests last
year of the new Bigeye and Multiple Launch Rocket System weapons at
Dugway. The weapons were filled with what the Army says are
harmless chemicals that safely simulate the characteristics of
deadly nerve gas.
   But Burnell Cordner, director of the state Air Quality Bureau,
said open-air use of those chemical simulants has never been
approved by the state, although other types of smoke-causing
chemicals have.
   ``They should have a permit if they emit things in the air that
we classify as a pollutant, and that's fairly broad. It may be that
for various reasons they may have fit some exclusion and did not
need a permit, but they should have checked with us first to find
out,'' he said.
   Cordner said penalties of up to $10,000 a day for each violation
are possible under state law. While the state may not pursue
penalties, it does want to know how many tests the Army conducted
without permits and what chemicals it used, he said.
   Dugway spokeswoman Kathleen Whitaker said the Army thought its
tests were allowed under an extension of a variance that the state
gave last year for certain tests. But she acknowledged that the
Army failed to provide the state a list of all pollutants it was
using by a Feb. 1 deadline.
   She said although the Army did not specifically notify the state
about the chemicals used in the tests, it did list them in a legal
notice in Salt Lake newspapers. Some of the chemicals also were
listed in an Army request last week to the Utah Air Conservation
Committee for variances to allow future tests.
   The committee temporarily refused to grant variances for many of
the chemicals because officials knew little or nothing about them
and because officials were upset that some compounds had been
tested without permission.
   David Thurman of the Utah Bureau of Epidemiology was asked by
the committee to study the chemicals on the Army's new list and
report on their characteristics. Thurman said he is not familiar
with most of the chemicals yet and said that most are not commonly
used in industry.
   Brian Killgallin, spokesman at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.,
said the chemicals included diethyl malonate, BIS (bis-2-ethyl
hexyl phosphonate) and TIP (triisopropyl phosphanite).
   Killgallin said diethyl malonate is used as a food flavoring
agent and also in the manufacture of barbiturates but is not
considered hazardous. He said BIS and TIP are both lubricant
additives. BIS is not considered hazardous, and TIP has been
qualified as hazardous only because of its ignitability, he said.

<HEAD>Hess' Son Calls for New Investigation of Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of Rudolf Hess called Wednesday for a new
investigation into the death last year of the Hitler deputy,
contending he was murdered at a Berlin prison, a news agency
reported.
   ``There is no substance in the allegation that Prisoner No. 7,
Rudolf Hess, committed suicide in Allied hands in Spandau prison on
17 August, 1987,'' Wolf- Ruediger Hess and a British surgeon said
in a statement quoted by the British news agency Press Association.
   ``On the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence that murder
was committed. Not one vestige of evidence supports the contention
of suicide,'' the statement said.
   It charged that British officials covered up evidence
surrounding Hess' death at age 93.
   Officials concluded Hess strangled himself with an electric cord.
   The surgeon, Hugh Thomas, examined the prisoner in Spandau in
1973 while working as a British army doctor. Thomas reiterates in a
book to be published Thursday his contention that it was an
imposter who died last year in Berlin and that Hess was murdered in
1941.
   Hess' family believes that the prisoner held by the World War II
Allies in Spandau, in the British sector of West Berlin, was
actually Hess, but rejects the official verdict that he committed
suicide.
   Thomas says Hess was murdered while flying to Scotland on a
peace mission in 1941 and claims a man in a second plane was
arrested by authorities who thought he was Hess.
   That man was murdered last year to prevent the leak of details
of a World War II plot by powerful Britons to overthrow Prime
Minister Winston Churchill, Thomas writes in his book ``A Tale of
Two Murders.''
   Thomas said in the book that the release of the man would have
led to ``open questioning'' about Hess and his high-level contacts
in Britain.
   ``The reason for the murder ... is the continued protection of
persons in the hierarchy whose reputations would suffer as a
consequence of wholesale treason in which they would be revealed,''
he said.
   Thomas has long claimed that the imprisoned man was not Hess. He
first made the assertion in his 1979 book, ``The Murder of Rudolph
Hess.''
   Thomas says two autopsies carried out on the prisoner support
his contention that the man did not bear scars of a severe chest
wound Hess suffered in World War I.
   At the time of the parachute arrival in Scotland of the man
claiming to be Hess, there was concern about his identity. He had a
far-fetched plan for a separate peace between Britain and Germany
and an alliance against the Soviet Union, which at that point had
not been attacked by Hitler.
   Hess was tried at Nuremburg in 1946, convicted of war crimes and
sent to Spandau where he was guarded by French, Soviet, British and
U.S. troops.
   The statement by Thomas and the younger Hess said that Hess'
suicide note was fake. It claims exhibits put together during the
investigation of the death were interfered with or destroyed by the
British.

   A Manhattan welfare hotel has been accused of
forcing families of three to live in 9-by-12 foot spaces without
bathrooms, tables or chairs, while collecting $1,230 a month rent
from the city.
   Legal Aid attorneys, who represent many of the Martinique
Hotel's 455 families, said that as many as 80 rooms have been
illegally subdivided.
   City officials, however, said the rooms do meet state standards
and have not been illegally divided. One of the hotel's owners also
denied the Legal Aid claims.
   Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the city Human Resources
Administration, said owners are not making more money by
subdividing, since they are paid by the person and two families of
three are now living where a family of six would once have been put.
   ``For New York City to decide that smaller families don't need
privacy is clearly a surprise to me and a violation of state
regulation,'' said state State Social Services Commissioner Cesar
Perales after hearing the Legal Aid attorneys' claims. ``My
regulations clearly apply to all families.''
   Perales ordered an inspection Thursday and said the city would
be ordered not to put any families in substandard rooms.
   The subdivided rooms are barely large enough to contain a
dresser and beds, and Legal Aid Attorney Steven Banks said they
lack bathrooms and ``furniture necessary for daily living _ like
tables and chairs to eat and do homework on.''
   Salvatore Tuccelli, who identified himself as one of the owners
of the hotel, angrily denied the charges.
   Tuccelli said the Martinique had begun using some of the hotel's
57 two-room suites to house two small families each rather than one
large one, but denied that the hotel had illegally subdivided any
rooms or housed anyone in ``cubicles.''
   ``There were no walls built. There were no divisions of
anything,'' he said. ``If you don't believe me, you can call the
Buildings Department.''
   A spokesman for the Buildings Department, Vahe Tiryakian,
confirmed Tuccelli's contention.
   ``We inspected several of the rooms in the Hotel Martinique,''
he said. ``Our inspector found absolutely no alteration work that
changed the size of the rooms. They are, in some of the setups,
sharing the bathroom ... but that is not disallowed by the building
code. There's nothing illegal about that.''
   Perales has said, however, that state regulations require a
private bathroom.
   Tuccelli said the rooms in the two-room suites varied in size,
and that some of them ranged from 130 square feet to 180 square
feet. He said he didn't know if any were smaller. A 9-by-12-foot
room would contain 108 square feet.
   He also denied that the rooms were barren of furniture.
``Whatever they need, we give them,'' he said.
   Ms. Trazoff acknowledged that conditions in the hotel were less
than ideal, but said the state knows the city is trying to change
the situation.
   ``Our first obligation is to provide a bed to every family.
Nobody has ever said hotels are a long-term answer,'' Ms. Trazoff
said.
   Ms. Trazoff said the city is aware the hotel has been dividing
two-room suites but said it was to accommodate smaller families.
She said there used to be many families of six or more, but most
families there now are smaller.
   ``They're getting the same money as they did when they housed a
family of six in one room as they do housing two families of three
in two rooms,'' she said.
   The city pays $17 a day for the first person and $12 for each
additional person per room. The monthly cost for a family of three
is $1,230; in welfare cases, the federal government reimburses the
city for 50 percent of that cost, while the state takes care of 25
percent.
   Last year, Perales ordered the city to stop using one
cockroach-infested room in the Martinique. It had no tables and
chairs and the family of three shared a bathroom with another woman
and her four children.
   That was the first time New York state had ordered the city to
move a family out of a welfare room. The state said, ``The
Martinique fails to even minimally conform to the standards set
forth in department regulations.''
   Perales said the Legal Aid Society sent his office a letter
saying other rooms at the Martinique had similar violations,
including putting families of three in 9-by-12 rooms.
   ``We require that when a local welfare department puts up a
family in a hotel or motel anywhere in the state that they be given
a private bathroom and other necessities'' _ like tables and
chairs, Perales said. He said his staff would inspect the
Martinique on Thursday.
   The city recently announced a plan in which it hopes to have
homeless families out of all welfare hotels in five years. It
currently houses 5,189 homeless families, of which 3,437 are in
hotels and the rest in shelters.

<HEAD>11th Circuit Reinstates Cases Against 62 Boat Operators In Mariel
Boatlift</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hastings-Impeach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday reinstated 62
cases against boat operators fined for bringing Cubans to the
United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   The cases were among 900 pursued by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service following the boatlift, which brought
125,000 refugees from the Cuban port of Mariel to Florida.
   The INS fined the boat owners and operators $1,000 for each
Cuban brought to the United States and then filed about 900
lawsuits against those who failed to pay the fines. The lawsuits
were divided among the judges in the Southern Disstrict of Florida.
   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami dismissed all 62
cases assigned to his court, saying the INS had failed to state its
case correctly. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday
threw out Hastings' ruling, saying the cases had been stated
sufficiently.
   Hastings is facing impeachment since fellow judges brought
unrelated misconduct allegations after his acquittal on bribery
conspiracy charges five years ago. He had hearings Wednesday before
a House Judiciary subcommittee in which he demanded dismissal of
the allegations.
   During the lengthy appeals of Hastings' action on the boatlift,
Hastings had rejected attempts by the government to get the cases
sent back to the INS for reconsideration.
   The government asked the appeals court to send all 62 cases to
the INS, but the court sent some cases back to the district court
and remanded others to the INS. The court ruled Wednesday the cases
could not be treated the same because the records before the court
for some cases were incomplete.
   The court also noted that some of the defendants had not been
served properly with the lawsuits. Its order gave the government
120 days to serve those defendants with the proper papers.

   A television station was playing comics
and robbers in this English village Wednesday, but the police were
not amused.
   Townspeople saw two men pulling on stocking masks in front of a
bank and called authorities.
   Police set up roadblocks, but wound up nabbing a rock star and a
comedian in a Rolls Royce and a crew of technicians sent to film an
episode of a show about a man showing a Martian around Britain.
   ``The police were very angry,'' said John Gwyn, producer of the
six-part series for the commercial Channel 4 television station.
``We are embarrassed about all this. We realize we should have
notified the police first.''
   He said the series, starring Jools Holland of the rock group
Squeeze and comedian Rowland Rivron, ``takes a lighthearted look at
aspects of British life, including money and how to get it.''

   Police said Wednesday they want to deport
66 foreigners viewed as security risks after a car bomb killed
three people last week in a bungled attack on the Israeli Embassy.
   In six days, 116 foreigners also have been refused entry to
Cyprus. Police turned them back at points of entry for failing to
give good reasons for their visits.
   A police statement said the records of 2,648 foreigners,
including 755 students, have been checked since the
explosives-laden car exploded near the embassy May 11.
   Nationalities were not disclosed. Police sources, however,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said most of those checked and
on the expulsion list were Arabs. Police have asked court officials
to issue expulsion orders for the 66, the statement said.
   A Lebanese man was arrested in connection with the explosion.
The driver of the car, who was killed, also was identified as
Lebanese.
   Among those refused entry were 26 people turned back at Larnaca
airport Wednesday, the police announcement said.
   This eastern Mediterranean island has a large Arab community.
Many of the Arabs are Lebanese who come on business or to escape
the 13-year-old sectarian civil war in their country.

<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee report is ``seriously
wrong'' in accusing Attorney General Edwin Meese III of violating a
White House policy by assisting scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.,
Meese's private lawyers said Wednesday.
   In addition, Meese's counselor at the Justice Department,
William Bradford Reynolds, claimed subcommittee chairman Carl
Levin, D-Mich., did not give subcommittee members an opportunity to
vote on the report.
   ``The subcommittee report was issued following standard
committee procedures. The report was circulated to every member of
the subcommittee for comment. ... Release of the report was
approved by the subcommittee members,'' said Levin in a response
statement.
   The report issued earlier this month says then-White House
counselor Meese and his deputy violated a White House policy
barring contacts with procurement officials, resulting in
favoritism toward Wedtech.
   Wedtech in September 1982 got a $32 million no-bid federal
contract to build small engines for the Army, after an intense
lobbying campaign by former White House political director Lyn
Nofziger and longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach.
   Meese's private attorneys, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, said
the subcommittee report was incorrect because the White House
policy permits contacts with procurement agencies when the White
House has a legitimate interest in information about procurement
matters.
   ``Mr. Meese's direction to his staff to ensure that Welbilt,''
which was then the firm's name, ``received fair treatment was
consistent with that widely recognized interest and was permitted
under the White House policy,'' Lewin and Rocap's said in an
18-page rebuttal.
   President Reagan had campaigned in the South Bronx, N.Y., area
where Wedtech was located and had expressed an interest in
promoting jobs to the area.
   ``The report appears to us to be seriously wrong in its
finding,'' Lewin and Rocap concluded.
   In a cover letter with the rebuttal sent to Levin, Reynolds said
he understood that members of Levin's subcommittee on oversight of
government management were not provided an opportunity to vote on
the panel's report.
   However, the panel's five Democrats or four Republicans were
given an opportunity to file dissenting views, and none did.

<HEAD>Parliament Guarantees Seats to Ethnic Minorities</HEAD>

   Ethnic minorities will be guaranteed seats in
Parliament under legislation passed Wednesday that changes the
election rules.
   Goh Chok, first deputy prime minister, said minority groups
welcomed the change and had said so at public hearings. ``All
agreed that a multiracial Parliament is essential to political
stability,'' he said.
   Parliament approved two bills Wednesday that amend the
constitution and revise polling laws to institutionalize
multiracial politics in this island republic of 2.6 million people.
   More than 76 percent are ethnic Chinese. Malays make up 15
percent, Indians 6 percent, and the rest are Eurasians and others.
The official languages are mandarin, English, Malay and Tamil.
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who first suggested racial
guarantees in 1982, told the hearings in March that race was a
constant factor in Singapore and chauvinism persisted. He said he
was trying to anticipate problems instead of reacting.
   Lee said his People's Action Party, which holds all but one seat
in Parliament, had trouble finding candidates in the Malay
community, which lags behind other ethnic groups in social,
economic and educational progress.
   About 85 percent of Singapore's people live in government-built
apartments and deliberate dispersal of races in the projects has
prevented concentrations of Malay voters who might elect their own
candidates.
   The measures were approved in the 79-member Parliament by votes
of 67-0, with no abstentions and the only opposition member absent.
   They provide for ``group represention constituencies'' with
three seats each, at least one of which must be filled by a person
who is Malay or from another minority.
   Lee's party has controlled Parliament since 1959. The fragmented
opposition is given little chance of ousting it in the general
election that must be held by December 1989.
   The last parliamentary vote four years ago elected 63 Chinese,
nine Malays, six Indians and one Eurasian.

<HEAD>Armed Forces Announces Closing of Offices in Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The armed forces announced Wednesday
it was eliminating the office of military attache in Washington and
closing the Defense Forces offices there.
   Capt. Jose Santos Mota, military and navy attache in Washington
since 1983, advised U.S. officials of the decision, said a
communique read to The Associated Press by telephone.
   It said Panama did not recognize the U.S. Southern Command,
which is based in Panama, and ``there are no channels of liaison or
communication with the armed forces of the United States.'' It did
not elaborate.
   The intelligence group of the Defense Forces chiefs of staff has
suspended meetings with a U.S. intelligence panel because ``that
counterpart has parallel organizations in the embassy as well as
other new ones assigned to the psychological war for the search for
information in the national territory,'' it said.
   It did not identify the other groups. But Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who controls the government, has accused the United States
of waging psychological and economic warfare against Panama.
   Noriega, the head of the Defense Forces, was indicted in
February on narcotics charges in Florida. The United States has
applied a broad range of economic sanctions in an effort to oust
him.
   Lt. Col. Arnie Williams, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington,
said late Wednesday the Defense Department would have no immediate
reaction to Panama's announcement.
   Williams also said he could not immediately confirm that the
Panamanian attache had advised U.S. officials of the decision to
close the Defense Forces office.

   Two British Airways jets carrying a total of 146
people flew within 1,500 feet of each other Wednesday in the latest
of a series of near-collisions over British airspace, the Civil
Aviation Authority said.
   The agency said a full investigation will be made into the
incident that occurred 5,000 feet over Warwick, 85 miles northwest
of London.
   A British Airways spokeswoman, who in keeping with British
custom was not identified, said the pilots of the two BAe 1-11s did
not have to take evasive action and continued their normal flights.
   The near-collision occurred as one plane was arriving from the
Dutch city of Amsterdam to land at Birmingham Airport, north of
Warwick, and another was ascending after take-off en route to
Dusseldorf, West Germany.
   The inbound flight was carrying 56 passengers and six
crewmembers, while the second jet carried 78 passengers and also a
crew of six.
   Aircraft are supposed to fly at least three miles apart
horizontally and 1,000 feet apart vertically.
   The Civil Aviation Authority recently adopted a policy of
announcing all near-crashes, regardless of the degree of danger
involved, following a spate of such incidents over British airspace.

   Equatorial Guinea has expelled seven
South African farm experts, Nigeria's government Lagos Radio said
Wednesday.
   The radio, monitored in Abidjan, quoted External Affairs
Minister Mamman Anka as saying that ``the racists left Equatorial
Guinea.''
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with more than 100
million people, had been pressing its West African neighbor to
order the South Africans out. A vocal opponent of apartheid,
Nigeria claimed the South Africans were building a satellite relay
station and expanding an airfield on one of Equatorial Guinea's
islands off Nigeria's coast.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in South Africa in which the 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   South Africa said the aid team was helping build roads, working
on medical projects and running an experimental cattle-breeding
ranch in the impoverished nation of 300,000.

<TEXT>
   Portland Mayor Bud Clark is heading for a
November runoff after falling just short of the number of votes
necessary to win a second four-year term outright.
   Write-in votes and about 6,500 absentee ballots remained to be
counted, but Clark said Wednesday that it was unlikely he would
pick up enough votes to avoid a runoff against a former police
chief, Ron Still.
   ``It looks like we're going to have to do it,'' Clark said.
   ``It's just frustrating to me,'' he said. ``All I want is the
job and to get the job done.''
   Clark needed one vote more than 50 percent of the total votes
cast in the non-partisan election Tuesday to win re-election
outright, but final unofficial results showed he had 49.92 percent.
   Also in Oregon, voters statewide approved by a 2-to-1 margin a
law requiring drivers and passengers of motorcycles and mopeds to
wear helmets.
   And in Colorado, voters in a Denver suburban area approved a
plan to let the city annex land for a new $3 billion airport that
would be the first major U.S. airport since 1974 and ease
congestion at the existing airport.
   Clark, with 59,981 votes, was followed by Still with 40,352, or
33.6 percent, and former city commissioner Lloyd Anderson with
12,733, or 10.6 percent. Former police chief Jim Davis was a
distant fourth, with 4,848, or 4 percent. The remaining seven
candidates split 2,251 votes, or just under 2 percent.
   Charles Duffy, Clark's press secretary, said the absentee
ballots would be counted Thursday and Friday. The mayor fell about
170 votes short of avoiding a runoff in the final, unofficial
tally, Duffy said.
   Clark, a tavern owner, scored a stunning victory four years ago
over incumbent Frank Ivancie and held a big lead in pre-election
polls in the non-partisan race this year despite a series of crises
that plagued the first half of his term.
   Asked how a runoff election would affect his ability to function
as mayor, Clark said: ``We have to limit the number of things that
we have on our agenda anyway and this just adds one more item and
takes energy out of my life. But we have plans for the city going
forward and the city is going to work.''
   Still, confident of a runoff, was one of two police chiefs who
resigned during Clark's first two years in office. Clark also fired
a third police chief, Davis.
   Clark's most famous and controversial appointee, Penny
Harrington, resigned after 16 months as the first female police
chief of a big U.S. city. Her resignation came a day after a
commission that Clark appointed issued a report sharply criticizing
her management and recommending her replacement.
   Portland's high crime rate was a major issue in the campaign.
Still said Clark's policies helped cause the problem, but Clark
vowed to make fighting crime his top priority.
   Clark, 57, has been criticized for his eccentricities, but there
were few campaign attacks on his personality. His trademark
``whoop, whoop'' cry is a staple of civic functions, and the
bicycling mayor has chronicled his political career with an
ever-present camera.
   In Colorado on Wednesday, Gov. Roy Romer and Denver Mayor
Federico Pena went to the barren site of what may become the
nation's largest airport and hailed Tuesday's land annexation
decision by Adams County voters.
   County residents approved the city's plan to annex the
45-square-mile site northeast of Denver by a 56 percent to 44
percent margin. The move cleared a major hurdle for the city to
build a replacement for crowded Stapleton International Airport.

<HEAD>Oil Explorers Plot Next Move After Expulsion From Big Cypress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil drillers have been told to tear down
their equipment and get out of Big Cypress National Preserve after
conservation groups protested that exploration would damage the
sensitive lands.
   The preserve covers cypress swamp, hardwood hammocks and grass
prairie in southwest Florida adjacent to the Everglades National
Park.
   The order, issued last week by the U.S. Justice Department,
resulted from a suit filed by the Wilderness Society, the Sierra
Club and five other environmental groups arguing that the federal
government pushed for drilling despite unresolved environmental
concerns.
   Shell Western Energy and Petroleum, a subsidiary of Shell Oil
Co., began exploration this month inside the 570,000-acre preserve
by drilling holes for seismic testing.
   Shell spokeswoman Mary Dokianos has said the government decision
will put 100 employees out of work and $1 million worth of
equipment will have to be dismantled.
   The company will probably continue to apply for rights to
explore for oil north of the preserve on land that will eventually
become part of the preserve under legislation signed by President
Reagan last month, Ms. Dokianos said.
   Until the government actually buys the land, the National Park
Service can't regulate oil companies wanting to explore there.
   But representatives of the Sierra Club say they will fight to
keep Shell from exploring in the expansion area too.

   The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly
repelled the first attack by Republican conservatives on the
U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.
   The Senate voted 91-6 to shelve a bid by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., to stop debate on the treaty on grounds that Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not duly authorized to sign it.
   The Senate's rejection of that claim was the first test vote on
the the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF Treaty. The treaty
would ban all U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400
miles.
   Gorbachev's signature was invalid, Helms claimed, because he
signed as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, not as a duly authorized representative of the Soviet state,
because he is only the head of a political party, not an official
member of the Soviet government.
   The attempt to derail Senate consideration of the pact came
after senators of both parties hailed the treaty as an important
first step toward worldwide arms control and appealed for swift
ratification before President Reagan's summit meeting with
Gorbachev in Moscow. The summit begins May 29.
   But as debate got under way, Helms, apparently beginning a long
series of delaying tactics, raised a point of order and claimed
that the treaty was invalid because Gorbachev's signature was on it.
   ``The fact remains that this document now at the desk is not
binding on the Soviet Union,'' Helms contended. ``It is only an
agreement between the president of the United States and the head
of a foreign political party.''
   Said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, ``If the time comes the Soviets
find it convenient to roll out the SS-20's they may have hidden,
they can say the treaty was signed by an invalid signature of
someone who had no business doing it.''
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said it was clear from the circumstances when
the treaty was signed last Dec. 8 that Gorbachev had ``full
authority to represent his nation.''
   ``It is clear that Mr. Gorbachev and no one else in that
delegation was the chief representative of the Soviet Union,'' Pell
said.
   ``Treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise judgment,''
said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chosen to lead the debate on the
Republican side of the aisle. ``There is no substance whatsoever to
the claim that the treaty was not legally signed.''
   Helms bridled at suggestions that he was raising technical
objections to the treaty for the sake of delay, saying: ``What is
occurring is not dilatory but is instead and in fact deliberative.''
   Those voting against tabling the Helms point of order were
Helms, Symms and Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; James McClure,
R-Idaho; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Not voting were: Sens. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del; Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla.; and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Earlier, a lengthy wrangle broke out of the kind that may make
it impossible to meet the deadline of the summit's opening May 29.
   The issue: how to assure that the commonly understood meaning of
the treaty at the time it is ratified is binding and will not in
the future be re-interpreted without the consent of the Senate.
   The controversy arises from the Reagan administration's proposed
re-interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile or ABM Treaty
to permit the deployment of a Star Wars strategic defense system.
   The issue is intensely partisan. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
opposing an amendment to address the issue in the current treaty,
warned of a lengthy debate to defeat it and said it was ``a booby
trap'' that could ``sink the whole ratification process.''
   ``It creates confusion and confrontation ... a turf battle
extraordinaire in which the Senate is seeking primacy in the
treaty-making process.''
   Specter contended that ``the administration seems to be having
more trouble with the U.S. Senate than with the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.
   But other senators said that if the Senate does not address the
issue on the missile treaty it would appear as if it has agreed to
the doctrine that a treaty can be re-interpreted, on grounds that
what the Senate was originally told about it did not represent the
full truth.
   ``If we do not do this the Senate's role in treaty making will
be completely obliterated,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
   The White House, meanwhile, stressed the importance of ratifying
the treaty quickly.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker said that ratifying
the treaty before the May 29 summit would be ``a major plus'' while
failure to do so ``might have some effect on the Soviets'
willingness to go forward with the next treaty,'' Baker said.
   ``It would not be a disaster, but it would be a
disappointment,'' Baker said. ``...I can visualize some Soviet
personality saying we (the United States) haven't ratified any
treaty since 1972, so what's the purpose of this.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas announced the
appointment of Lugar, a former chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, to manage the treaty debate for the GOP.
   That post normally would have gone to Helms, the senior
Republican on the Foreign Relations panel. But Helms is the most
outspoken opponent of the pact, vowing to vote against it even if
he is the only senator to do so.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters:
``This treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves if
we deal only with those serious, legitimate amendments that ought
to be dealt with on this issue.''
   But Dole and Byrd said they expect a number of amendments to be
offered and cautioned that the pact could be delayed.
   ``This treaty is an important symbol,'' said Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash., as the first full day of debate on the treaty opened.
   ``To build on this important symbol it is absolutely necessary
that we indicate to our NATO allies that we believe in this treaty,
that we all stand together,'' he said.
   Adams and several other senators described the pact as a
building block toward agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty which would cut long-range nuclear arms by up to 50 percent.
   ``This is a window in time that might not repeat itself for
several decades,'' Adams said. ``There are significant groups in
both the United States and the Soviet Union, minorities in my
opinion, that don't trust and won't sign any agreement.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the chamber's deputy GOP leader,
called the treaty ``a very small first step, but a necessary one.''
   Noting that in the years since World War II the two superpowers
never have been as close to actually cutting back their nuclear
forces as they are now, Simpson told the Senate:
   ``After 44 years of talk, finally there is a little dual point
of convergence that is important to capture. ... Instead of talking
the talk, we're finally walking the walk,'' he said.

   Authorities seized a suspected bomber for
the Irish Republican Army on Wednesday as he was released from
prison on other charges, and his angry supporters scuffled with
soldiers, police said.
   Patrick McVeigh fled when authorities tried to arrest him as he
was released from Portlaoise Prison, 50 miles from Dublin, after a
seven-year term for weapons possession. Police fired warning shots
and caught him.
   About 35 supporters, who had turned up expecting McVeigh to be
freed, surged forward and clashed with police. One man was
arrested, but injuries were reported, police said.
   The new warrants accused McVeigh of involvement in terrorist
bombings in mainland Britain from 1981-83. Authorities had to
release him Wednesday because he completed his term, but they
figured on seizing him as soon as he stepped outside the prison
gates.
   The IRA is fighting to force the British to leave Northern
Ireland. The outlawed organization wants to unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic to the south.
   After his arrest, McVeigh was driven to nearby Carlow and
ordered held for 48 hours pending a court appearance on moves to
extradite him to Britain.
   In London, Scotland Yard said the latest warrants were issued on
Friday, when Britain and Ireland resolved a legal dispute over
extradition of suspected terrorists.
   The extradition warrants allege that McVeigh had control of
explosives and conspired to cause explosions at unspecified
locations in Britain between 1981 and 1983.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said he was
believed wanted for questioning in connection with bombings in
London in 1981 which resulted in three deaths.
   McVeigh was also wanted for questioning in the bombing of
Harrods on Dec. 17, 1983, which killed six people and injured 93,
the agency said. McVeigh was in prison then, but authorities may
believe he helped plot the bombing from behind bars.

<TEXT>
   Conductor Gunther Herbig said Wednesday he will
resign as music director of the troubled Detroit Symphony Orchestra
to take over the same job with the Toronto Symphony.
   The announcement was seen as a serious blow to Detroit's
cultural community and a coup for Toronto's.
   Herbig, 56, has been music director in Detroit since 1984.
During that time, he appeared as guest conductor with major
orchestras in Europe and the United States.
   He said lack of money for expansion, recordings and tours was
the factor leading him to leave Detroit, where the orchestra went
on strike last year.
   The Toronto Symphony promised him three recordings a year, an
ambitious series of world tours, an expanded orchestra of 105
players, television and radio broadcasts and acoustical
improvements at the orchestra's home, the Roy Thomson Hall. He will
step up as music director in Toronto in 1990 with a renewable
contract ending in 1992.
   At a news conference, the silver-haired conductor described
Toronto as a city that ``really cares about the arts.''
   ``The situation in Detroit is such that they could not come back
with a counter-offer,'' he said.
   Herbig was born in Czechoslovakia of German parents and made his
name with the Dresden Philharmonic and Berlin Symphony Orchestra.
   He succeeds the British conductor, Andrew Davis, who ended his
13-year tenure in Toronto to take over the British Broadcasting
Corp. Symphony Orchestra in London.

   Confessed serial killer Gerald Stano, who
claims to have slain 41 women, got an indefinite stay from a
federal appeals court Wednesday, less than 24 hours before he was
scheduled for execution.
   Attorneys for Stano turned successfully to the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta after a federal judge here refused a
stay of execution. The district judge had rejected arguments that
his defense counsel was ineffective.
   The appeals court, however, ruled that Stano was entitled to a
hearing on the claim.
   Stano, 36, who has been convicted of 10 murders, was scheduled
to die in Florida's electric chair at 7 a.m. Thursday.
   After hearing eight hours of legal arguments over two days, U.S.
District Judge Patricia Fawsett ruled Wednesday that Stano's lawyer
had correctly informed him of the consequences of pleading guilty
to the murders of two women, but that ``Stano rejected this
advice.''
   ``I explained to Mr. Stano that he was at risk, that there were
no deals, and Mr. Stano understood that,'' the former lawyer,
Howard Pearl, had testified.
   In issuing the stay, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit
ruled that it remained unclear whether Stano understood what his
lawyer meant when the attorney told Stano he had not examined all
the evidence.
   Carolyn Snurkowski, director of death-penalty appeals in the
office of Attorney General Bob Butterworth, said the state likely
would not appeal the stay, but she reserved final judgment until
she had a chance to review the order.
   ``We still have to look at it more carefully,'' she said.
   After giving him life sentences on guilty pleas in other cases,
Volusia Circuit Judge James Foxman sentenced Stano to death in 1983
in the killings of Susan Bickrest, 24, in 1975 and Cathy Muldoon,
23, in 1977.
   ``Counsel followed the instructions of his client,'' who had
been found mentally competent by five experts, Fawsett said.
   Stano, who was brought from death row to Orlando for the
district court hearing, showed no emotion when Fawsett issued her
ruling. He was relaxed and attentive and often smiled and joked
with defense counsel.
   The exact number of Stano's victims may never be known, said
Assistant Attorney General Belle Turner. ``With so many murders,
there has understandably been confusion over some cases and
details,'' she said.
   Although Stano has been sentenced on only 10 of the crimes _
receiving seven life sentences and three death penalties _ Florida
investigators say they have documented 25 of the murders claimed by
Stano in this state and that there may have been others.
   There is less known about the cases in the New
Jersey-Pennsylvania area which Stano admitted to, but authorities
in those states have linked him to a number of unsolved murders
over the years.
   Daytona Beach Police Sgt. Paul Crow, the chief investigator who
arrested Stano in 1981, has testified that Stano provided crucial
information about burial sites, victims' clothing, appearance,
methods of death and other minute details that only the killer
would know.
   He has been jailed since the 1981 arrest.
   Ann McMillan of Ocala, a psychologist who has done extensive
studies of Stano's life, says he fits into the classic pattern of
multiple killers such as Charles Manson and David ``Son of Sam''
Berkowitz.
   In 1982, she estimated Stano's death toll at 35.
   Stano's death warrant is his second for the Bickrest-Muldoon
murders. Both women, who worked as cocktail waitresses, were forced
into his car at gunpoint, driven to remote areas and killed,
according to trial testimony.
   Besides the issues of inadequate defense counsel and of mental
incompetency by Stano, Olive accused police interrogators of
misleading Stano into a series of ``bogus confessions'' by
promising that he would not receive the death penalty. Those
arguments have been heard and rejected by various courts in the
past.
   ``All that happened here was that a guilty man pleaded guilty
and was appropriately sentenced,'' prosecutor Turner argued.

<HEAD>Judge Agrees To Reopen Controversial Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has agreed to reopen
the trial of the so-called ``Sharpville Six'' to hear defense
arguments against the death sentences imposed on the black
defendants, court officials said Wednesday.
   The six _ five men and a woman _ were scheduled to hang March 18
for complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor in
Sharpeville, south of Johannesburg. A stay of execution was granted
March 17.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice W.J. Human set June 6 for a
hearing on the case, which has attracted international attention.
Defense lawyers had applied to reopen the trial so they could
present evidence that a key state witness was coerced into giving
false testimony.
   President P.W. Botha has said he will not intervene in the case,
despite widespread appeals for clemency.
   The case has sparked debate in part because the six were not
convicted of contributing physically to the death of councilor
Jacob Dlamini. Instead, they were convicted under the doctrine of
common purpose, which held them responsible because they allegedly
were active participants in the mob which set out to kill the
councilor.
   The killing occurred during riots provoked by a rent increase in
Sharpeville and neighboring townships.

   A bus carrying 50 passengers went out
of control on a winding road and rolled into a deep ravine in
western Venezuela, killing six people and injuring 30, officials
reported Wednesday.
   The bus, on a regular trip to Caracas Tuesday from the western
city of Merida, fell about 420 feet, said police officer Angel
Frias.
   ``Some passengers, including driver Miguel Chacon, managed to
get out of the bus as it was falling. It could have been even
worse,'' he said.
   The accident occurred at La Yuquita, 250 miles west of Caracas.

   Three men were arrested in the theft of a
car belonging to a state lawmaker who was beaten to death, but they
have not been charged in the slaying, a district attorney said
Wednesday.
   At the Capitol, meanwhile, officials called for heightened
security throughout the building and grounds after the body of a
severely beaten woman was found at a nearby construction site
Wednesday.
   A 12-member task force of state and local police has been
working round-the-clock gathering information on the slaying of
Rep. William Telek, said Dauphin County District Attorney Richard
A. Lewis.
   Telek, a Cambria County Republican, was found dead Tuesday
morning on a side street about three miles north of the Capitol,
his wallet and state-leased car missing. Officials said he died of
injuries from repeated blows to the head.
   Three men arrested Tuesday in the theft of Telek's car remained
in custody but were not charged with the slaying, Lewis said.
   ``The task force is sifting through all the information coming
in,'' he said.
   About 24 hours after Telek's body was found, the body of a
Harrisburg woman was found a block from the Capitol.
   ``You can't dismiss the possibility, but there doesn't appear to
be any obvious connection'' between the two slayings, Lewis said.
   In the wake of the two deaths, House and Senate leaders urged
tighter precautions throughout the Capitol complex.
   Senate President Pro Tem Robert Jubelirer said Telek's death has
rekindled previously voiced concerns, especially about a recently
constructed parking garage.
   Jubelirer said some have speculated that Telek's killer might
have entered his car while it was parked in the underground garage,
later surprising him.
   The Department of General Services had begun looking into adding
security personnel patroling the Capitol garage before Telek's
death, said spokeswoman Pam DiSalvo.
   She said the upgraded security plans included boosting the
number of Capitol police officers patroling the two-level garage,
installing a card entry system into the garage and putting camera
surveillance throughout the Capitol complex.
   Charged with theft by receiving stolen property were the driver
of Telek's car, Bernard Williams, 17, of Harrisburg, and John
Wesley Anderson III, 19, of Susquehanna Township. The third person,
a juvenile, was turned over to the juvenile authorities. His
identity was withheld.
   Despite his age, Williams' name was made public because of a
prior conviction on adult charges. A hearing for the men is
scheduled for next week.
   Lewis identified the woman whose body was found by security
guards at the construction site as Ann Landis, 39, a former nurse
at Harrisburg State Hospital.

   Lisa Bonet, who stars as a college
student in the hit ``Cosby Show'' spinoff ``A Different World,'' is
pregnant, an NBC spokesman confirmed Wednesday.
   Miss Bonet, 20, married musician Romeo Blue six months ago.
   There was no immediate word on how her pregnancy would affect
her role in the series, according to a secretary for NBC spokesman
Bob Meyers, who confirmed her pregnancy. The show was rated No. 2
for the season according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   During her career on both ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A Different
World,'' Miss Bonet has raised eyebrows by twice posing nude and
starring in the movie ``Angel Heart,'' which barely escaped an
``X'' rating for its torrid love scenes between Miss Bonet's
character and that of her co-star Mickey Rourke.
   She posed nude for Interview magazine and in a recent issue of
Rolling Stone.
   Her marriage to Blue, also known as Lenny Kravitz, took place in
Las Vegas in November.

   FBI agents arrested the former head of the
collapsed Sasson Jeans empire Wednesday for allegedly threatening
the life of the federal bankruptcy judge handling his company's
reorganization.
   Paul Guez, the majority shareholder in Sasson Jeans Inc.,
allegedly threatened the life of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland who was presiding over the Chapter 11 reorganization of the
apparel licensor in Manhattan.
   According to a criminal complaint, Guez, 43, threatened to kill
Lifland and other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceeding on
Monday ``if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached.''
   ``I did not threaten anybody. I am astonished to see I have been
accused of this,'' Guez told U.S. Magistrate Barbara A. Lee during
a marathon hearing in which prosecutors sought to have him detained
without bail and Guez sought his freedom in order to attend another
bankruptcy hearing on Thursday.
   He claimed the charges were ``part of a conspiracy'' to block
his attendance at the confirmation hearing on Sasson's
reorganization plan.
   Ms. Lee ordered Guez held overnight pending a detention hearing
scheduled to take place before the afternoon bankruptcy hearing.
   It wasn't the first time Guez has gotten into hot water over his
combative antics since taking over as his own lawyer in bankruptcy
court.
   Lifland has cited Guez twice for civil contempt and referred the
matters to the district court level.
   Guez is also under indictment for allegedly assaulting a federal
marshal over bankruptcy proceedings.
   The criminal complaint said Guez is currently ``undergoing
psychiatric evaluation concerning his fitness to stand trial'' in
the assault case.
   The complaint was based on information supplied by a
confidential informant described as a lawyer with ``a privileged
professional relationship'' with Guez.
   The complaint further stated that ``due to the tone and
demeanor'' of Guez, the informant believed he was ``fully capable
of carrying out his threat.''
   Sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since October 1986. On
Wednesday Lifland approved the sale of the company's name for $8
million to Stanwich Partners of Stamford, Conn.
   The Tunisian-born Guez arrived in this country in 1976 with $74
and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising he
took the market by storm and made millions by licensing the Sasson
label for watches, lingerie and luggage as well as jeans.
   But the company began to unravel due to internal feuds and
Sasson was swamped by lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11
reorganization.

<HEAD>Peres Says More Soviet Jews Will Be Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said
Wednesday that he has been assured that 1,400 Jews would be allowed
to emigrate from the Soviet Union this month, continuing the upward
trend of recent months.
   Peres, in an appearance at an Israeli Bond luncheon in
Manhattan, said he had learned of the increased emigration on
Tuesday when he met with President Reagan, Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin.
   Later, Peres reiterated his remarks before the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   ``I must admit we do live in a changing world,'' he told the
group of about 100 presidents. ``Things that looked impossible a
year ago, three years ago' are now becoming reality.''
   He said it was also agreed that 10 Jews who had been refused the
right to emigrate on national security grounds would now be allowed
to leave.
   And he said there was agreement that Soviet psychiatric
hospitals _ long accused of housing and maltreating dissidents _
would allow doctors from outside the country to examine their
patients.
   Peres also said an agreement would be signed at this month's
Reagan-Gorbachev summit to enlarge the cultural life of Soviet
Jewry.
   The National Conference on Soviet Jewry had reported Tuesday
that 1,086 Soviet Jews emigrated in April, the highest monthly
total in nearly seven years. That figure is far less than the
emigration totals for 1979, when the monthly average was more than
4,000.
   Soviet officials claim that only 15,000 of the country's 1.8
million Jews want to leave, though others claim the number is more
than 400,000.
   Peres also said Dubinin read a Soviet proposal for an
international peace conference on the Middle East in which the
Soviet Union would play a part. Peres said the new proposal was an
improvement upon previous Soviet suggestions, but Israel still
could not agree to it.

   The Foreign Correspondents'
Association of the Philippines said Wednesday that allegations that
foreign journalists financed a rebel ambush could hurt the
country's press freedom.
   Also Wednesday, a military official denied the British
Broadcasting Corp. was named as the foreign media group that
reportedly paid New People's Army rebels to stage an ambush in
February in which a general's son and 10 other soldiers were killed.
   The correspondents' group urged President Corazon Aquino's
government to investigate the matter and make the results public
quickly.
   ``We fear that such unsubstantiated charges may constitute a
potential assault on freedom of the press. We believe that coverage
of both sides of a guerrilla conflict is essential to responsible
journalism,'' the group said in a statement.
   Col. Marino Filart, deputy constabulary commander of Bicol where
the ambush occurred, presented a captured rebel Wednesday who said
``Caucasian'' journalists gave her group a wad of 100-peso ($5)
bills and three M-16 Armalite rifles to stage the ambush for
filming purposes.
   Filart said the woman did not identify the journalists involved.
He added that Manila reporters may have concluded that it was the
BBC because of a letter with the company's letterhead seized by the
military from the rebels.
   Filart said the letter, signed by a certain Mina Daum, requested
video coverage of rebels training but he added that ``we are not
sure if the intent of the letter was pushed through.''
   His superior, Brig. Gen. Eduardo Taduran, was quoted by Manila
newspapers Monday as saying that the letter showed the BBC was the
group involved. The military has provided no further evidence to
substantiate the charges.
   The BBC has denied the allegation and said it had no crew in the
Philippines when the ambush occurred.
   Rep. Gregorio Andolana urged the Philippine House of
Representatives Wednesday to enact measures that would protect
journalists' right to cover events related to the insurgency, the
government-run news agency reported.
   Andolana, a former human rights lawyer, also asked his
colleagues to stop the military from carrying out surveillance of
journalists who maintain contact with rebel sources for their work,
the Philippine News Agency said.
   On Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of the Capital
Regional Command, said the military had seized rebel documents with
the names of 112 foreign and Philippine journalists who had been in
touch with the guerillas since 1987.
   Aguirre said no legal action would be taken against the
reporters but some would be placed under surveillance.
   He did not release any names of the reporters.

   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, saying he wished
``it were possible to turn back the clock,'' declared an official
day of mourning for Thursday for the 27 victims of the Radcliff
church bus disaster, coinciding with the first five funerals.
   Grief counselors from the National Organization for Victim
Assistance conducted a seminar in Radcliff on Wednesday for school
counselors, military personnel and others dealing with the victims'
families. A separate seminar open to the public was scheduled
Wednesday night at Radcliff Middle School, where 16 of the dead
were pupils.
   Meanwhile, four people remained hospitalized Wednesday from a
public transit bus accident in Cleveland that killed a teen-age
passenger, and police were checking reports that the bus
accelerated after striking a car.
   The Tuesday accident was triggered when a motorist tried to make
a left turn in front of the bus. The bus struck the car and then
lurched out of control, striking a tree, a utility pole and a fence
before grazing a building and another pole, said Patrolman Emil
Cielec.
   And in Clinton Corners, N.Y., a National Transportation Safety
Board inspection found no structural or mechanical problems with a
bus that overturned Monday, killing three people and injuring 20
others, police said Wednesday.
   However, mechanical failure has not been entirely ruled out as
the cause of the accident, said state Police Sgt. Dennis Cody. The
driver of the bus remained hospitalized and was unable to talk to
investigators Wednesday, Cody said.
   Wilkinson ordered flags flown at half-staff across the state
Thursday in memory of the 24 children and three adults who died
when their bus was struck head-on Saturday night by a pickup truck
being driven in the wrong direction on Interstate 71 in Carroll
County, 100 miles northeast of Radcliff.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, still hospitalized in
Louisville, was charged with 27 counts of murder, one for each of
those who died in the accident. Authorities said he was intoxicated
at the time of the crash. Thirteen other people also were still
hospitalized Wednesday.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials also continued to
study the crash.
   Jean Fasone, in charge of the probe, said investigators are
comparing buses similar to the one involved in the crash to
determine whether 1977 safety standards requiring a caged fuel tank
would have prevented the fire that enveloped the bus after the
accident. The bus was built shortly before the standards went into
effect.
   In a statement released Wednesday by his office, the governor
said: ``If it were possible to turn back the clock, we would.''
   ``Whatever consolation we can give will never make up for the
loss of friends and loved ones. We will make this day (Thursday) as
an official day of mourning, but the memory of the victims of this
tragedy will be with us always.''
   The governor planned to attend a memorial service Thursday
evening at North Hardin High School in Radcliff. Most of the
victims were military dependents or had ties to nearby Fort Knox,
and the service at the school's 2,400-seat football stadium was to
include hymms and a performance by the post military band, said
Lelia S. Haddle, secretary to Mayor Joseph Hutcherson.
   It wasn't known how many of the victims' families would attend
the service, Ms. Haddle said. ``We've got familes that say they
can't handle another service,'' she said. ``But everybody wants to
do something, and this is one way to handle it.''
   Four of the victims _ Mary Catherine Daniels, 14; Julie Ann
Earnest, 12; Denise Ellen Voglund, 13; and Amy Wheelock, 14 _ were
to be buried at Radcliff on Thursday. A fifth, 14-year-old Tina
Michelle Mustain, was to be buried in Tyler, Texas. All attended
the middle school.
   Most of the funerals were scheduled for Friday, including a
joint service for six of the victims at Radcliff First Assembly of
God, the church that owned the bus.
   Members of the church's youth group, with more than a dozen of
their invited friends, used the bus for an all-day outing Saturday
at the Kings Island amusement park north of Cincinnati.

   Thousands of protesters shouting
anti-government slogans marched through the capital Thursday with
the coffin of a radical student who committed suicide.
   The procession came a day after thousands of demonstrators
fought police with firebombs and rocks on the eighth anniversary of
the bloodiest uprising in South Korea's history.
   Thursday's march was in honor of Cho Sung-man, 24, who stabbed
himself in the stomach and jumped off an annex to Myongdong
Cathedral Sunday in an anti-government protest.
   About 20,000 students and dissidents took part in the march,
many of them carrying placards calling for an end to the government
of President Roh Tae-woo and the expulsion of U.S. forces.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Drive out the
Yankee imperialists,'' marchers chanted to the beat of drums.
   Prayers were said at the spot in the cathedral compound where
Cho died, and Roman Catholic priests led a ceremony outside the
cathedral.
   On Wednesday, fierce clashes broke out in the center of Seoul
after riot police hurling tear gas grenades broke up a student
march near City Hall. Students blocked streets around Myongdong
Cathedral and attacked riot police who tried to intervene.
   Terrified pedestrians on their way home from work were caught in
the fighting. People trying to flee screamed with pain from the gas.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship which committed the
Kwangju massacre!'' protesters yelled. ``Drive out the Roh murder
regime!''
   Roh was an army general when military force was used to quell
the 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju. At least 190
people were killed.
   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, reported Wednesday that a
student angered because a campus festival was going ahead on the
Kwangju anniversary set himself on fire in Chonan, about 31 miles
south of Seoul. The agency said he suffered serious burns.
   There was also fighting in the provincial cities of Sunchon,
Pusan, Chungju and Chongju following student rallies marking the
Kwangju anniversary.
   Speakers in Seoul denounced the United States, claiming
Washington had supported successive military regimes in South
Korea. Students cheered as a crude, home-made American flag was
burned.
   ``Yankee go home!'' protesters chanted. The United States has
40,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
   Waves of screaming students charged riot police units in
downtown Seoul, hurling rocks, bricks and firebombs that exploded
in plumes of blazing orange gasoline.
   Protesters and police pelted each other with rocks and stones
ripped from sidewalks as clashes continued into the night. Several
officers and a press photographer were hit by firebombs that
ignited their clothing.
   Police reinforcements were rushed to the center of the city and
lines of officers in green combat fatigues, black helmets and gas
masks swept along the streets as rifle squads fired volleys of
choking tear gas.
   The National Police, which mobilized 50,000 riot police
nationwide, said about 43,000 students and protesters took part in
anti-government demonstrations in 106 locations Wednesday.
   Police declined to release any figures on injuries or arrests.
   About 10,000 students attended a rally at Korea University in
eastern Seoul. Students applauded speakers who demanded a full
investigation into the Kwungju uprising and urged Roh be ousted.
   The anniversary was marked in Kwangju almost without incident
for the first time since the uprising. Tens of thousands of people
visited the cemetery where many victims of the killings are buried.
   Up to 50,000 people took part later in an anti-government
protest in the city. Police opened fire with tear gas launchers,
but then announced over loudspeakers that they had made a mistake
and apologized. The rally finished without further incident.
   At the time of the uprising, Chun was a general leading other
military officers who seized power after a coup. Most of them later
retired to take on political posts, and Chun became president. The
government says 191 people were killed when troops ended the
uprising, but dissidents claim more died.
   Roh, who took power in February after winning election in
December, has tried to defuse lingering bitterness over Kwangju.

<HEAD>Trucker Blamed For 40-Mile Swath of Destruction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A rampaging tractor-trailer driver allegedly
rammed more than two dozen vehicles along 40 miles of freeways
Wednesday, leading the California Highway Patrol on a chase through
heavy rush hour traffic.
   No one was seriously hurt, the CHP reported, but some people
whose cars were struck suffered minor injuries.
   The truck was ``apparently intentionally ramming other vehicles
on the westbound Pomona Freeway'' near San Dimas, about 30 miles
east of Los Angeles, CHP spokesman Mike Maas said.
   Altogether, more than 24 accident reports were made, Maas said.
   ``He was just going straight ahead,'' said CHP Officer William
Cobb, who pursued the trucker along the Hollywood Freeway, where
the chase ended. ``Whatever got in his way, he just kept pushing.''
   Near the end of the 40-mile swath of destruction, Cobb said he
flashed his lights at the driver, trying to get him to stop. Cobb
said he turned on the siren of his motorcycle, to no effect.
Finally, he pulled alongside and motioned for the trucker to pull
over.
   ``He looked at me, shook his head and said, `No way,''' Cobb
said.
   The Highway Patrol, joined by a police helicopter and a dog
unit, finally stopped the 18-wheel rig in heavy traffic as it was
plowing ahead at about 5 mph, Maas said.
   The driver, identified as Charley Tom Lee Jr., 25, of Haltom
City, Texas, was stopped shortly before 4 p.m. and booked for
investigation of numerous counts of assault with a deadly weapon _
his truck.
   Lee also was to be booked for investigation of possession of a
controlled substance, evading arrest, reckless driving and
possessing a concealed, loaded weapon.
   On the Hollywood Freeway, the truck hit about a dozen vehicles,
closing three traffic lanes and creating a traffic jam more than 10
miles long.
   The semi-tractor trailer was bound for Los Angeles with a load
of ironing boards, and the driver's route was traced by accidents
reported on the Pomona and Hollywood freeways, Maas said.
   ``We had just a trail of accidents reported as we were trying to
catch up with this guy,'' Maas said.
   ``It was in very heavy traffic and at very low speeds, and the
truck was ramming his way through the traffic,'' Maas said.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II completed a South
American tour Wednesday by calling for a ``reconciled and brotherly
Paraguay'' but the ruling party blasted his meeting with opposition
leaders, calling them ``a grab-bag of society's destroyers.''
   In a nighttime farewell address at Asuncion's airport, the pope
urged citizens to build ``the Paraguay of tomorrow'' based on
Christian values.
   ``I have happily witnessed the dream that moved you to launch in
unity a reconciled and brotherly Paraguay,'' he said.
   The country's authoritarian president, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner,
told the pope his visit was ``unforgettable.''
   Stroessner, widely regarded as a dictator, described Paraguay as
``pluralistic and democratic ... without violence, without
terrorism.''
   The pope departed in an Alitalia Boeing 747 for Rome, where he
was to arrive Thursday afternoon.
   During his 12-day trip, the pope visited four nations _ Uruguay,
Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay. It was his ninth visit to the region.
   Earlier in the evening at a youth rally in a muddy field near
the airport, more than 100,000 teen-agers sang ``Happy Birthday''
to the pontiff in Polish, his native language. It came at the end
of a busy day that included visits to the Parana River port city of
Encarnacion and Caacupe, site of the national Catholic religious
shrine.
   During a Mass in Caacupe, John Paul II repeated a call for
special attention to the rights of the country's largely landless
peasants and Indians.
   Today's church ``wants to strongly support their demands that
their legitimate rights be respected, without allowing them to
forget their duties,'' the pontiff said.
   In Encarnacion, on the border with Argentina, John Paul said
Paraguay suffers from a concept of life that puts ``profits and the
thirst for power above the human person and his needs.''
   ``I call on you to construct a society of love,'' said the pope.
   John Paul urged his audience to participate in ``a new
evangelization.'' He paid homage to the missionary priests who
sowed the seed of Catholicism among the native tribes of
present-day Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil in the 16th and 17th
centuries.
   Encarnacion is in the heart of the area where Jesuit priests
founded 30 missions in an effort to convert Guarani Indians from
1608 until 1767, when the Spanish crown expelled the order from
Latin America.
   Among those attending the prayer meeting were several thousand
Argentines, many from Polish immigrant communities who crossed a
recently completed bridge linking Argentina and Paraguay.
   The Asuncion daily newspaper Patria, run by Stroessner's
Colorado Party, criticized a papal meeting Tuesday night with a
church-picked group of cultural and civic leaders that included
opposition activists. The group is known as the ``Builders of
Society.''
   ``There is no doubt about the opposition ideologizing,
politicizing and manipulation of everything concerned with the
meeting,'' Patria declared. ``It would be better to call them a
grab-bag of society's destroyers.''
   In an editorial, Patria labeled Rene Recalde, an organizer of
the meeting, ``an ideologized element from the extremist sector of
radicalization.''
   Government officials and Colorado Party members boycotted the
meeting, which Paraguayan authorities originally canceled but later
permitted after the Vatican protested.
   At the meeting, the pope heard denunciations of political
oppression and then told his cheering audience, ``It is impossible
to speak of true liberty, and even less of democracy, where there
is no real participation by all citizens.''
   Stroessner, 75, took power in a 1954 military coup and recently
was elected to an eighth term in voting his opponents say was
rigged. The local church has regularly criticized his human rights
record and authoritiarian style, pressing for a more pluralistic
form of government in this landlocked nation of 3.8 million people.
   Wednesday marked the second time John Paul had celebrated his
birthday outside Rome since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago. He
celebrated his 65th birthday in Belgium.
   About 1,000 well-wishers serenaded him in the morning at the
Vatican envoy's residence in Asuncion. The pope emerged to greet
the crowd and told them, ``I still feel young, especially when I am
with young people.''

   The names of the dead were known less than
a day after a fiery bus crash killed 27 people, but official
confirmation of the deaths ``just brought it fresh again'' to the
victims' families, a minister says.
   Hearses began removing the bodies Tuesday afternoon from a
National Guard armory in Carrollton, 100 miles northeast of here,
that served as a morgue.
   There was ``a lot of grief'' inside Radcliff First Assembly of
God church, where most of the victims' families gathered Tuesday
morning to be told that the last of the burned bodies had been
identified, said the Rev. Dan Mattingly, minister of Christian
education at the church, which owned the bus.
   The bus collided head-on Saturday night with a pickup truck
being driven north in the southbound lanes of Interstate 71 near
Carrollton. The fuel tank on the bus ruptured and burst into
flames, authorities said.

computerized cash transfers.
   First National Bank of Chicago announced Tuesday that the
employee, whose name was not released, tried to steal the money
through a sophisticated wire transfer scheme involving banks in New
York and Chicago.
   The Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, quoting
unidentified sources, reported today the money ultimately was to be

The newspapers said the suspect had worked at the bank six to eight
years but was not a high-ranking official.

   U.S. officials say Kremlin leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev may withdraw 50,000 to 100,000 troops from Eastern Europe
this year in a bid to win support for a new round of East-West
negotiations on conventional forces.
   A unilateral Soviet withdrawal of that scale would have ``little
impact strategically'' said a U.S official. But the political
payoff could be immense in Western Europe, where polls show great
enthusiasm for Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies.
   U.S. officials trying to anticipate Gorbachev's summit strategy
have also detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summit
meeting before Reagan leaves office in eight months. The projected
sites are Vienna, Austria, or Budapest, Hungary.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

   President Reagan's decision to pursue an
ambitious space shield against nuclear weapons came despite his own
top advisers' belief that the Star Wars system wouldn't work, says
former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane.
   McFarlane, giving his first public account of the origins of
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, told a congressional
committee Tuesday that the president apparently came up with the
idea on his own against the advice of McFarlane and other top
military officials.
   The idea that any technological system ``could so devalue the
nuclear threat'' from additional and more accurate Soviet
intercontinental missiles as to produce ``a no-nuclear world ... is
infeasible,'' he told the House Armed Services Committee.

beyond all expectations, many economists and big investors
responded with a chorus of ``Bah, humbug.''
   Funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news. But
they've done it before and most likely they'll do it again.
   They responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate, to
increases in factory use, even to the dollar's new stability.
   It is a strange, discomfiting world in which good is bad, happy
is sad, up is down, square is round, best is worst, last is first,
strong is weak, bottom is peak, rich is poor and less is more.
   And if the sages are being spooked by the ``good'' news _ news

economic survival _ it's no wonder they're exaggerating ``bad''

   The winter coat that Olga Boguslavsky's friend
found at the GUM department store during her buying trip to Moscow
cost 730 rubles. That's $1,170 or almost four months pay for the
average Soviet industrial worker.
   For the same money, she could have bought enough meat at state
subsidized prices to last for six years.
   Consider, too, the case of the collective farmer who can sell
the government a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of meat for the established
wholesale price of 4 rubles and then turn around and use that same
money to buy back twice as much meat at subsidized retail prices.
   Economists spearheading Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
economic reforms use examples like these to argue that the
state-run economy's price structure must be revamped.
   But Soviet consumers, long accustomed to low-priced necessities,
worry openly that higher prices may be the only effects they feel
from Gorbachev's sweeping modernization program.
   Yet the cost of products is only one of the problems faced by
Soviet consumers. When merchandise is available, there's the
interminable wait on line to purchase it. And, often, the products
are of inferior quality.
   The government reported last month that state-run enterprises in
the first three months of the year had trouble meeting the
country's needs in many fields, from shoes to machine tools.
   Gorbachev acknowledges there has been little improvement in
consumer supplies since he came into power three years ago.
   Speaking to a gathering of farm workers in March, he said, ``A
person is willing and able to pay for consumer services, but the
trouble is that there is seldom any person or establishment
supplying them.''
   A month earlier, he told the Communist Party Central Committee,
``There have been virtually no tangible changes for the better in
the quality of consumer goods.''
   He acknowledged that ``perestroika,'' his effort to rebuild and
modernize the Soviet economy, will be successful only if those
problems can be solved.
   But he also has complained that bread, which costs about 30
kopeks (50 cents) a loaf, is so cheap that children use it for
footballs.
   Overhauling prices and new laws designed to make local
enterprises self-supporting are at the heart of Gorbachev's
economic reforms.
   The state now spends 84 billion rubles ($134 billion) a year on
subsidies, and that is expected to rise to 104 billion rubles ($166
billion) by 1990. Of that, 80 billion rubles ($128 billion) will be
spent to subsidize food, said economist V.I. Shprygin of the Soviet
Institute for Research.
   Gorbachev and his economic advisers say they will try to ease
the impact of reduced subsidies. But it won't be easy for him to
convince consumers that the higher prices that come with reduced
subsidies are in their best interest.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda receives more letters
complaining about the price of consumer goods than on any other
issue.
   So it was for Ms. Boguslavsky's friend, who had come to Moscow
on a buying trip from the Ural Mountains.
   ``Beating our feet into the helpless pavement around the store
... in the end we buy the coat for 700 rubles,'' Ms. Boguslavsky
wrote in a recent edition of Pravda. After all, she said, ``you
can't just wrap yourself in a blanket.''
   ``Who needs the kind of perestroika in which they raise prices
for food and everday goods that are in short supply,'' A. Nasedkin
of the Russian village of Bogdanovo wrote in the government
newspaper Izvestia. ``An increase in prices contradicts
perestroika; it must be accompanied by a lowering of prices.''
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda blamed a sugar shortage that
has emptied shelves in many areas not only on moonshiners, who are
said to be using it to make up for state-imposed vodka shortages,
but on rumors that the price is about to rise.
   Soviet consumers face regular price increases, despite the
semblance of stability offered by prices printed or stamped on
merchandise.
   Cheaper products that factories cannot sell or make profitably
simply disappear from the stores to be replaced by slightly
different versions at higher prices.
   Ms. Boguslavsky said the cost of children's shoes has gone up 60
percent in the last decade. A Western visitor to the Black Sea port
of Odessa recently could find no umbrella in the city of almost 1
million people for less than 27 rubles ($46).
   American economist Ed Hewett of the Brookings Institution noted
during a recent visit to Moscow that food price increases prompted
the disturbances that led to the founding of the Solidarity
movement in Poland in 1980 and that prices are an issue in recent
unrest there.
   He said Hungary considered food prices too volatile and
straightened out wholesale prices first, then gave consumers such
freqent warnings that there was little reaction when prices finally
went up.
   Hewitt said retail price reforms in the Soviet Union could wait
while economists try to straighten out the price of coal and other
industrial goods. But instead, he said, Soviet officials are
``running up little flags and watching the bullet holes from upset
consumers.''

<HEAD>Pools Make Soviet Farm Different, But Agriculture Still In Crisis</HEAD>

   With two swimming pools in its
sports complex and a fleet of buses that take workers to the
fields, the Victory Collective Farm might look strange to most U.S.
farmers.
   While their American counterparts live in lone homesteads
surrounded by barns and acres of land, Soviet farm workers inhabit
small wood or brick houses clustered along paved streets in a
central town. Private vegetable gardens take up practically every
inch of spare ground.
   The farm's managers like to impress visitors with statistics:
the collective has 277 tractors, 22 dining rooms, two
kindergartens, a stadium and a sports complex with a small
swimmming pool for beginners and a larger pool for adults. A total
of 4,678 people live on the farm.
   It is a showcase of Soviet collective agriculture set on 20,000
hectares (47,000 acres) of southern Russia's best farm land. Due in
part to innovative techniques for improving productivity, the
farm's production figures far outstrip national averages.
   But despite the operation of 50,000 such collective and state
farms employing 25 million workers, Soviet agriculture is in a
state of crisis. The Soviet Union still must import grain to feed
its own people. Last year, agricultural output fell 3 percent,
according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Zhores A. Medvedev, a Soviet geneticist with years of training
in agriculture, notes in his 1988 book, ``Soviet Agriculture,''
that farming takes 35 percent of the Soviet investment budget,
depriving industry and consumers of funds, goods and services they
need. The system doesn't produce enough equipment to plow or
harvest.
   ``All parts of the food program are moving, except for the
production of food,'' he says.
   Soviet agriculture has been plagued for decades by central
planners who tell farms what and how much to plant, lack of
incentives for farmers to work the state-owned land, inefficient
production and poor storage and transportation facilities.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a peasant's son who directed
agricultural policy before taking charge of the Communist Party
three years ago, wants to increase incentives for farm workers to
improve performance. But he has stopped short of challenging the
state's monopoly on land ownership.
   The inefficiency of the collective-farm system is demonstrated
by the extraordinary productivity of the small private plots farm
workers are permitted to till for their personal use. According to
Western statistics, private plots occupy only 3 percent of the land
but provide about a third of the nation's meat, 40 percent of the
eggs and 60 percent of the potatoes.
   Victory farm officials say they have been using financial
bonuses and other incentives for 20 years to encourage farmers to
work harder and take care of state-owned machinery. And they say
their efforts have paid off in higher production figures.
   Farm facilities such as the canning factory, feed mill, storage
facilities, and greenhouses lush with cucumbers and tomatoes are
expected to pay for themselves. If they do, everyone profits.
   ``The better everyone works, the more money they will make,''
said greenhouse manager Viktor Solovyev, showing off wooden crates
packed with cucumbers being shipped north. ``We understand the
economics very well.''
   With a year-end, 100-percent bonus for meeting production
targets, greenhouse workers can make 5,000 rubles ($8,000) a year,
Solovyev said. That's about twice the average industrial wage. But
money alone isn't enough to make people work harder; there must
also be consumer services and goods worth buying.
   That is one of the primary goals of Gorbachev's ``perestroika,''
or restructuring of the economy and society.
   Gorbachev told collective farmers at a March conference in
Moscow he believes the bureaucratic system prevents most of them
from being as successful as they should be.
   ``Give people the right conditions, and they'll find a way to
increase production,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader has consolidated agriculture under a single
ministry, preached self-reliance and encouraged smaller work teams
to increase efficiency and higher pay for those who work harder.
   Farm-village complexes are traditional in some areas of the
Soviet Union, having grown out of a feudal system of land
management that operated for centuries before the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution.
   Private farms prospered briefly under the New Economic Policy of
the 1920s, the period following the Communists' breakup of large
estates, severe repression and grain requisitioning during the
Russian Civil War that came on the heels of the revolution.
   But in the 1930s, dictator Josef V. Stalin violently imposed
collectivization of agriculture, executing or exiling those who
opposed his efforts to control all land and production.
   The Kuban area, where the Victory farm is located in a
relatively warm climate not far from the Black Sea, is among the
regions that suffered most from the famine that swept the country
during collectivization and the hardships of Nazi occupation during
World War II.
   This year, the International Wheat Council estimates the Soviet
Union will import 34 million tons of grain but says improved
technology offers ``every possibility'' for better harvests.
   Still, vast quantities of food spoil in storage or shipment.
During half the year, it is nearly impossible to find vegetables
other than potatoes, onions, carrots or cabbage in Moscow. When
other produce can be found, it is in the markets where farmers sell
what they produce on their private plots.
   The Victory farm's basic work is done from clearings set amid
the rich, flat fields of wheat, sugar beets and sunflowers that
spread for 17 kilometers (10 miles) in each direction from a
central landing strip for crop dusters.
   A fleet of 35 buses provides free transportation every morning
to far-flung areas where workers tend fields and orchards, raise
pigs and milk cows, mix insecticides and prepare cattle feed.
   Just after 5 p.m. on a recent spring day, buses filled the
streets in a sort of village rush hour as they dropped farmers off
at the end of the work day. Hours are longer when the work demands
and shorter during slack periods.
   Most of the farm's crop work is done by brigades, groups of 100
or so farmers who work from clearings where machinery is stored.
Each brigade has a dining room where the workers can eat three
meals a day for less than a ruble ($1.60).
   But pursuing the smaller-is-better idea Gorbachev has pushed,
regional officials in Krasnodar are trying smaller brigades of
three to 10 people, which they say seem to be most efficient. And
they are studying plans to set up a bank account for each team to
emphasize the need for profitability.
   Gorbachev has made clear that the state will continue to rely on
private gardens.
   Under new legislation, city dwellers may be allotted up to 600
square meters (yards) of land outside their cities to plant
gardens. They are eligible for loans of up to 5,000 rubles ($8,000)
to build a small hut on the plot.
   Sergei Zhilin, administrator of the Krasnodar region's program
for private plots, said there are about 70,000 of them in the area
and more than 1 million throughout the country.
   Gorbachev's efforts to decentralize decision-making would give
more farm managers the leeway that Victory Collective Farm
officials have had to try new ideas and adapt to local conditions
that central planners in the Moscow bureaucracy can't anticipate.
   Bureaucrats, Gorbachev said, ``coerce, command and continue
issuing orders about when and how things should be done: when to
sow, plow and so on. They just cannot reorganize. This is what I
would describe as the critical line of perestroika.''

<HEAD>Odessa Still `Mama' of Corruption Despite Face Lift</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is the final part of a five-part series</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ODESSA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seedy digs of old Moldovanka, home
for most of the century to crime bosses and legendary tales of
banditry, have been razed and replaced by mournful rows of standard
gray Soviet apartments.
   Italian Street, where Genoa merchants built grand homes in the
last century, is now named for Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The
crumbling mansions house state museums and foreign tourists.
   Languid clerks dole out sugary fruit juice in the bars along the
Black Sea waterfront, where sailors and stevedores drank and
brawled for 150 years.
   The body of old Odessa is decaying and neglected, but looks are
deceiving. The soul of the Ukrainian city known as the ``Mama'' of
dealers, drifters and orphans in the 1920s still spills vice from
darkened recesses into the open marketplace.
   ``You can get anything at the weekend markets _ foreign
currency, liquor, drugs, even prostitutes,'' said Yuri, a
32-year-old black marketeer who keeps his thumbnails long to aid in
dispensing cocaine.
   Teen-agers in jean jackets and designer sweat shirts bought on
the black market flood a slot-machine parlor at the boat terminal.
Heavily rouged prostitutes in leather skirts approach foreign
sailors and well-heeled locals entering the International Merchant
Marine club on Rosa Luxemburg Street. Shell-game swindlers
clustered around the ``Privoz,'' the central market grounds, draw
circles of suckers, supporters and ringers.
   Three young men encountered during a stroll under the chestnut
trees of Deribasovskaya Street say their city is safer now in the
past, when their mothers and grandmothers were afraid to walk alone
after dark.
   ``But everything is still for sale here,'' observed one of the
sportily dressed students. ``Odessans are just natural
businessmen.''
   Housewives out for their daily shopping brazenly approach
foreign tourists to inquire whether they have jeans, cosmetics or
anything else to sell.
   The state-run press says Odessa is the door through which most
contraband enters the Soviet Union, and city officials reluctantly
concede it is true.
   Deputy Mayor Galina Izuvita blames lax security in checking the
cargo of incoming ships. ``In this respect we are envious of cities
that do not have ports through which drugs can enter,'' Ms. Izuvita
said.
   Port manager Nikolai Pavliuk, who has worked in the harbor for
28 years, counters: ``Never has anyone been found to have taken
part in illegal transit of contraband.''
   But to Sasha, a 30-year-old construction worker and drug dealer,
``Odessa is still Mama.''
   At a darkened cafe, Sasha surreptitiously gulped cognac from a
coffee cup and fanned a wad of several thousand rubles to show that
the benefits of trading currencies and narcotics far exceed the 230
rubles ($387) a month he earns from his legitimate job.
   Organized crime networks fed by smuggled goods flourished in
``Mama'' Odessa in the chaos that followed the destruction of the
port during Russia's civil war.
   Writer Isaac Babel had but to change a few names to pass city
life for fiction. Mobster Benny Krik, the likeable hero of ``The
Odessa Tales,'' was modeled after Odessa's Mishka the Japanese.
   But Stalin's terror suppressed the mobs, and 70 years of
socialism have rebuilt the port, housed the orphans and, more
recently, shut down the obvious dens of iniquity.
   Official efforts to tame Odessa's anything-goes spirit have
pasted a veneer of respectability over the city. Youth clubs and
dance halls now occupy vacated bars and liquor shops.
   The authorities launch periodic anti-corruption drives, but a
steady influx of contraband has kept the black markets alive, and
cleanup campaigns are usually short-lived.
   Gypsy fortunetellers cast a wary eye around each club or cafe
before whispering to a patron at the low wooden tables that the
secrets of the future can be had for two rubles ($3.40).
   Many of the city's elegant old buildings were closed or
demolished during a building and refurbishing binge, but a glimpse
of Odessa's lost grandeur is still visible above the colorless
facades and cloudy store windows on Deribasovskaya Street.
   Three or four stories above metal store signs with unimaginative
names like ``Shoes,'' ``Women's Clothing'' and ``Sundries,''
rooftops sport disintegrating cupolas and cornices and leaded
windows from which most of the glass has fallen out.
   A renovation plan begun five years ago touched off a campaign to
preserve Odessa's landmarks, and in early April, chief architect
Vasily Mironenko was fired after proposing to cut down the famed
chestnut trees along Primorsky Boulevard, overlooking the port.
   Many Odessans oppose their city's changing appearance.
   A cab driver traveling through the renovated Moldavanka
neighborhood contended there is an official plot in the Soviet
capital to force Odessa into the Moscow mold.
   ``Odessa is not a phenomenon anymore,'' he said. ``It's just a
town.''
   The driver was quoting Odessa writer Mikhail Shvanetsky, who
said the same about the city in the underground literature he
circulated in the 1970s.

   When the last of four operations was
completed, the surgeon reminded his young Guatemalan patient that
she owed him a dinner of black beans and rice.
   ``We agreed upon that fee,'' Dr. John Johnson told Nicolasa
Menchu, a 27-year-old student who came to the United States on a
scholarship and ended up having surgery to correct a 142-degree
curvature of the spine.
   Johnson had warned Ms. Menchu that without surgery, the
curvature would eventually choke off her vital organs, resulting in
death.
   The procedure that Johnson proposed carried no guarantees.
``There's a 60 percent chance of success, a 20 percent chance of no
improvement, and a 20 percent chance that you won't survive,'' he
told her.
   Ms. Menchu made her decision in mid-February. ``I decided to
gamble on an operation even though I'm accustomed to the way I
am,'' she said.
   At the time, she was 3 feet, 11 inches tall and weighed 64
pounds. Today, she is 2{-inches taller, the curvature has dropped
to 90 degrees and she is gaining weight.
   She also is preparing to return to classes at the University of
Louisville under a United States Information Agency scholarship.
The agency brought 154 students to this country in January 1986 in
an effort to offset Soviet influence in Central America.
   While swimming last fall, Ms. Menchu developed breathing
problems and was turned over to Johnson, co-director of the spine
clinic at Norton Hospital and assistant professor of orthopedic
surgery at the university's medical school.
   In the hospital, Johnson bolted a metal band to her skull and
attached weights to stretch her spine.
   ``That's your halo,'' he told her, ``because you've been so good
about everything.''
   Two more operations removed bone chips from her spine.
   The final step came in March when Johnson hooked up a set of
rods to his patient's spine for more straightening and stability.
   His team used a magnet ``doughnut'' attached to Ms. Menchu's
head to warn it when the surgery threatened the spinal cord.
   ``The magnet sends a discharge into the arms and legs, causing
them to react,'' he explained. ``At first, Niko could move only one
leg or the other. We must have started and stopped seven times
before both limbs worked in unison.''
   Ordinarily, the surgery and hospital stay would cost $89,000,
but Johnson is donating his services and Norton expects to cover
the remainder.
   Because of the long recuperative period, the USIA extended Ms.
Menchu's scholarship.
   ``Hopefully, I'll get my bachelor's degree in education by
Christmas and be ready to go home,'' she said.
   Her family lives in Totonicapan, where she once made and sold
pottery to help finance her education.
   Although she still has some pain and cannot yet sit in a chair,
Ms. Menchu said, ``It's been worth it a thousand times, and I've
grown a lot.''
   She was close to tears, however, on May 9 when the university
graduated the 12 other foreign students who had accompanied her to
the Louisville campus.
   ``My turn is coming, I guess.''

<HEAD>`Frank's Place' and `Wonder Years' Best New Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television's two best new shows are off the
air just now but both seem likely to return in the fall. Let us
give thanks.
   In a purely personal survey, ``Frank's Place'' on CBS and ``The
Wonder Years'' on ABC tied for best new show. The runner-up was
ABC's ``China Beach.''
   With the season over, let's take a look back at the best and the
worst. This is strictly one reporter's opinion, and there are no
awards _ or booby prizes.
   ``Frank's Place,'' which stars Tim Reid as a New England college
professor who inherits his father's Creole restaurant in New
Orleans, is well-written and has wonderfully defined characters.
It's a so-called ``dramedy'' with few laughs, but the stories are
grabbing and get into the characters. It's also the first TV show
to capture the essence of New Orleans and appreciate the difference
between Creole and Cajun.
   ``The Wonder Years,'' told from the perspective of an adult
looking back on his youth, is like reliving adolescence, but in the
safety, and sweet privacy, of your living room. It all rings true:
the domineering older brother, the nerdy best friend, the confusing
infatuation with girls, and the parents who want to help but don't
quite understand.
   ``China Beach,'' which tells of the women in Vietnam, has
wonderfully drawn characters. You really care about these people.
   Here are other best shows of the year:
   ``L.A. Law,'' NBC _ The writing is unbelievably good, at times
bordering on tasteless and tacky, yet so right for these offbeat,
well-defined, well-cast characters.
   ``St. Elsewhere,'' NBC _ Another show with great writing that
dared to take chances and push the limitations of taste and
naughtiness.
   ``Newhart,'' CBS _ An underrated show that is a perfect blending
of concept, writing, characters and acting. It's always true to its
characters, always funny.
   ``Beauty and the Beast,'' CBS _ The show that took the year's
corniest concept and made it work as the most romantic show of
recent memory.
   ``Designing Women,'' CBS _ The first show to find Southern women
both intelligent and incredibly funny.
   ``Aaron's Way,'' NBC _ Wonderful schmaltz, well-written, best
family show of the year. That didn't do it any good, though. NBC
canceled it.
   ``Golden Girls,'' NBC _ You know exactly how each character will
react, yet you can't wait for them to do it. Funny, funny, funny.
   ``Cheers,'' NBC _ Best comeback of the year. The show seemed to
be on its way out, but they gave it a fresh, new look. Kirstie
Alley deserves an Emmy.
   ``Night Court,'' NBC _ Naughty, naughty, naughty. And incredibly
funny.
   ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS _ It isn't ``Platoon,'' but it's not bad.
   Other good shows: ``Murder, She Wrote'' on CBS, ``Matlock'' on
NBC, and ``Head of the Class'' and ``Perfect Strangers,'' both on
ABC.
   Audiences couldn't seem to decide about NBC's ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd.'' NBC did. It's canceled.
   The jury is still out on ABC's ``Hooperman.'' John Ritter is
television's best comic actor, but he's too restrained here.
   ABC's ``Dolly!'' proved once again that variety is dead. Dolly
Parton sings well and has a winning personality, but her show
didn't cut it. ABC has decided to do away with the weekly show but
says Parton might do other projects for the network.
   The pits:
   ``Highwayman,'' NBC _ Dumb from every standpoint, including some
of the worst acting, or non-acting, ever seen on television.
   ``A Different World,'' NBC _ The only thing that would improve
this unfunny show is to send Lisa Bonet back to ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``Supercarrier,'' ABC _ A good idea turned into a cartoon.
   The most disappoining show was ABC's ``Moonlighting.'' It was a
case of the mighty falling on its face. It was once a great show,
but now who cares?
   Special categories:
   Best show on PBS: ``Wonderworks,'' consistently first-rate.
   Best TV movie: NBC's ``The Ann Jillian Story.''
   Best miniseries: NBC's ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln.''
   best game show: ``Jeopardy.'' Imagine, a game show for people
who can think!

   Elsewhere in television:
   TYPE CASTING _ Pop singer David Cassidy plays a rock star who
tries to boost his career by faking his death in ``Career Move,''
on ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' on the USA Network on Saturday,
May 28. ...
   MORE RIGHT STUFF _ Valerie Bertinelli will portray pioneer
aviatrix Pancho Barnes in a three-hour movie for CBS in the fall.
Barnes converted her desert ranch into a makeshift school for
pilots in World War II. Her ranch eventually became Edwards Air
Force Base. Her friends included Gen. George Patton, Jimmy
Doolittle, Amelia Earhart and Chuck Yeager. Kim Stanley played
Barnes in the movie ``The Right Stuff.''

<HEAD>Mergers Hit the Nation's Farms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on assignment. Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agribusiness has not escaped the urge to
merge that has caused many companies to disappear as individual
entities in recent years.
   But is merger mania good for farming?
   Robert Glassman, financial vice president of Fresno's Britz
Inc., thinks so. He says bigger concerns can exert more clout,
especially in dealing with large wholesale buyers of raw or
processed foods.
   Glassman, whose company is engaged in family farming and
distribution of crops and fertilizers, expects continued
consolidation of the now widely dispersed fruit and produce
industry to offset antitrust restrictions he said favor big grocery
chains.
   ``Grocers can call each other and ask, `How much are you paying
for raisins today?''' Glassman said. ``We can't call each other and
ask, `What are you selling raisins for today?'''
   Antitrust laws should be revised to give agribusiness more
flexibility in setting prices, Glassman said at a recent forum
sponsored by the California Chapter of the American Society of Farm
Managers and Rural Appraisers.
   He noted that farmers received 50 percent of the money American
consumers spent on food in the 1950s, but the farmers' share fell
to 30 percent in 1986 and 28 percent last year.
   ``This trend may eventually put us all out of business, and we
must as farmers and marketers reverse it _ now,'' Glassman said.
   Softening of antitrust laws seems unlikely, so Glassman expects
mergers in the agribusiness area to continue.
   But Charles Bonner, president of Bonner Packing of Fresno, said
a report in Business Week magazine showed 70 percent of business
acquisitions were failures, resulting in lower stock prices and a
drop in market share for the surviving companies.
   ``I think a lot of acquisitions we have seen in agriculture the
last 10 years have been unmitigated disasters,'' Bonner said.
   David R. Smith, president of Dole Citrus in Ontario, Calif.,
countered that some companies, such as Paramount Properties, seek
out undervalued properties in their area of expertise, citrus and
nuts. Paramount is a diversified farming company based in
Bakersfield, Calif.
   ``Paramount focuses on two main commodity groups that allows
them to move quickly to evaluate property ... and make purchases
before anybody else can make that determination and get capital
together to make the purchase,'' Smith said.
   On the other hand, Dole's parent company, Castle & Cooke Inc.,
looks for purchases that will increase its share of a given market.
   But Bonner contended that companies can be fooled when they buy
land or processors they think are inexpensive.
   ``When we bought a dried fruit plant, we stole that asset, but
we're still paying for it,'' said Bonner, citing a decision by his
family raisin-processing company to diversify.
   ``What can start as a real cheap price often turns out to be an
expensive education,'' Bonner said. ``We've had a couple of those.''
   He noted that Tenneco West spent a decade, and more than $30
million, advertising its own raisin brand, Sun Giant. Bonner
contended that the petroleum company wound up with 6.4 percent of
the $200 million United States raisin market, or about $13 million
in sales, which he translated to a profit of perhaps $200,000 a
year.
   ``That I think, is one of the reasons Tenneco assets were
undervalued after 10 years,'' said Bonner, noting that Dole
purchased Tenneco's farming assets.
   Smith said Dole's aim in acquisitions is based more on cash flow
than liquidation values.
   ``When we look at acreage, we look at the environment in which
it exists today and the environment in which it will exist in five
to 10 years,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>What Pays Off In Home Remodeling?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fireplaces are hot. Swimming pools are not. And
kitchens and baths are the rage of the season.
   That's the latest from the burgeoning home-improvement industry,
whose business has gone through the roof in recent years as an
increasing number of U.S. homeowners spruce up what's probably
their single biggest investment.
   ``Building was in the '50s what remodeling is in the '80s,''
said Jacelyn Swensen, a spokeswoman for the National Association of
the Remodeling Industry, which proclaimed May ``National Remodeling
Month.''
   The Census Bureau says $94 billion was spent on home remodeling
nationwide last year, up 4 percent from 1986 and 102 percent from
1982. And the National Association of Home Builders predicts $98
billion in expenditures this year.
   While such improvements will help augment a home's resale value,
not all remodeling costs are fully recoverable, experts warn.
   ``With a (below-ground) swimming pool you only get a third of
what you put in at the most,'' said Ms. Swensen. ``Some people I
guess are turned off by the maintenance and upkeep, the health
hazards and added insurance.''
   Those adding a fireplace, on the other hand, could recoup as
much as 58 percent beyond the original investment, she said.
   Other popular remodeling projects and estimated return on
investment, according to the NARI, include:
   _Adding a full bath, between 74 percent to 126 percent.
   _Greenhouse addition, 29 percent to 100 percent.
   _Adding skylights, 34 percent to 94 percent.
   _Major kitchen remodeling, 73 percent to 90 percent.
   _Re-roofing, 85 percent.
   _Adding insulation and siding, 77 percent.
   _Adding a deck, 64 percent to 80 percent.
   _Bathroom remodeling, 80 percent.
   _New windows and doors, 38 percent to 75 percent.
   _Room addition, 53 percent to 72 percent.
   The magazine Practical Homeowner says do-it-yourselfers stand to
recoup even more of their original investments, although appraisers
warn that a less-than-perfect job can sometimes backfire.
   Practical Homeowner says the national average recovery rate for
those ambitious enough to install a fireplace on their own is 220
percent, with the cost averaging $1,280, vs. $3,010 for a
professional job.
   Handy homeowners could see an average payback of 185 percent on
kitchen remodeling, with the cost averaging $3,150, vs. $6,930, the
magazine said.
   Real estate experts say alterations are most likely to raise a
home's resale value when there's a wider variety of homes in a
neighborhood, along with a variety of prices for recently sold
homes. They note, however, that even the most expensive and
extensive renovations won't raise a home completely out of the
price range for other neighborhood houses.
   The most marketable features, experts say, are modern bathrooms
and kitchens, well-maintained landscaping and neutral colors in
paint and wallpaper.
   Ms. Swensen said renovations most in demand by homeowners this
year include kitchen and bathroom remodeling, skylights, ceramic
tile and basement and attic conversions. Out of fashion, she said,
are energy conservation projects, such as double- or triple-pane
windows.
   ``Since a lot of homes were built after World War II, from 1950
to 1960, ... a lot of money is being spent on modernizing and
adding more space,'' Ms. Swensen said.
   Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research for the homebuilders'
association, said that at least half of the post-war baby-boomers
are homeowners who have seen their family sizes and incomes
increase in recent years. At the same time, home prices have risen
sharply, he noted.
   ``... Therefore, more people are making the decision that it's a
better value to stay put and remodel rather than move,'' added
Brian Patchan, remodeling director of the homebuilders' trade group.
   Homeowners are also finding lots of money available for
remodeling, through home-equity loans, where rates are sometimes
lower than those offered for conventional mortgages.

<HEAD>Sagging Faith Spurs Churches To Combined Effort</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In heavily secularized modern society,
statistics indicate the churches aren't getting their job done by
working at it separately. So they're tackling it together.
   That's the path-breaking commitment of a broad coalition of
American church leaders, Roman Catholic and nearly every brand of
Protestant, to reclaim those detached from religion.
   ``The time has come for us to stop the quarreling with one
another, the rivalry and sheep-stealing, and learn to work together
in mission,'' says the Rev. Alvin A. Illig of Washington, D.C.
   Illig, director of the Paulist National Catholic Evangelization
Association and a key figure in the wide cross-section of church
leaders concerned with evangelism, added in an interview:
   ``The great challenge before us is reaching out to the huge mass
of people not involved in churches and synagogues. We've all got to
work together on it if we are to have any success in
evangelization.''
   Spurring this collaboration is the aim of an unprecedented,
multidenominational ``Congress 88, a National Festival of
Evangelism,'' in Chicago, Aug. 4-7. Planning for it has gone on for
three years.
   It is backed by a rare alliance of church specialists in
evangelism from about 35 denominations, ranging from Mennonite to
Catholic, mainline to Pentecostal, and Salvation Army to Southern
Baptist.
   ``It's a breakthrough of real significance,'' Illig said.
   ``If Southern Baptists and Catholics and a coalition of this
scope can come together and work harmoniously, it's ecumenical
enough to encourage a lot of folks that they can, too.''
   A similarly inclusive affair, ``A Gathering of Christians,''
takes place May 21-25 in Arlington, Texas, expected to involve
about 3,000 evangelical, mainline Protestant, Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox Christians.
   However, that assembly is intended mainly to vent collective
spiritual energies and concerns about contemporary social issues.
   On the other hand, the Chicago congress, which hopes to bring
together up to 15,000 church people, has a threefold practical
purpose: To sharpen awareness of the need for evangelism; to offer
advice from experts on various ways of doing it; and to provide
resource materials for participants to take home and use.
   ``We can learn from each other,'' Illig said. ``Lutherans,
Catholics, Mennonites and Presbyterians, sharing their insights,
can learn from one another in building the kingdom of God.''
   He said the urgency of stepped-up, concerted evangelizing
efforts to bring in those outside the fold is pointed up by the
growing ranks of unchurched Americans, now totaling 90 million.
   ``To a large extent, we've ignored them in terms of specific
outreach programs,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, this group has increased in 10 years from 38 percent
of the population to 41 percent, he said, while the proportion
without even a religious preference has risen from 3 percent in
1948 to 9 percent now.
   ``There's no question we're losing ground,'' Illig said, adding
that out of an average five congregations, only one is growing, one
is shrinking, and three are simply static, remaining the same.
   ``One reason we're failing and not making any progress is the
scandal of divisions that is confusing and contradicts the basic
nature of Christianity,'' he said.
   While the unusual cooperation on the problem can't mend the
brokenness, he said it can share insights and approaches, kindle
mutual energies and enlist the various churches in the common task.
   In doing it, he said, people drawn into religious participation
will naturally ``pick the particular church community to enrich
their own lives,'' whatever the denomination.
   ``We've got to stop fighting one another, and together raise
consciousness about the huge communities out there without any
religious life,'' he said.
   Planning for the joint congress developed through the Washington
Roundtable on Evangelism, comprised of specialists on evangelism
from various denominations.
   The Rev. Grady Allison of New York, evangelism director for the
Presbyterian Church (USA) and president of the congress board of
directors, says:``We have Christ in common. We have the Scriptures
in common. We have a concern for people in common. Other matters
that have kept us apart are of lesser importance.''
   The Rev. Paul Benjamin of the Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ, head the National Church-Growth Research Center in
Washington, and executive director for the congress, cites the
millions unchurched and says: ``It has been well said that the cost
of a divided church is an unbelieving world. ... We can no longer
afford the luxury of our competing divisions.''
   Illig, 61, is treasurer for the event, which is expected to cost
more than $1 million, with more than 60 denominational agencies and
Catholic orders putting up advance funding, with registrations
expected to cover it.
   He also is a longtime, practiced evangelist on the American
scene, a mission for which his Paulist order was founded in this
country in 1858, at a time when Catholic evangelism was virtually
non-existent.

   People who live together before marriage
should be denied a full church wedding because ``such a wedding
would be dishonor,'' and instead be married in a low-key ceremony,
Hartford Archbishop John F. Whealon said in a column published in
The Catholic Transcript.
   ``I would be happy to witness your marriage in a simple, quiet
ceremony with two witnesses, and perhaps your immediate families,''
Whealon said he would tell such couples. His comments were
addressed to priests confronted with the issue.
   Whealon said, however, couples living together should be granted
a full marriage ceremony if they are willing to ``live separately
and chastely'' until they are married.
   The statement serves as an advisory and does not set policy.
Parish priests say they make the ultimate decisions on church
weddings based on pastoral consideration.
   Whealon said co-habitating couples who want an extravagant
church wedding are in effect asking the church to provide ``tacit
approval'' to unacceptable behavior.

   Drawing parallels between the beliefs of
Christians and the Shiite Moslems who held him captive for 19
months, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco says that a better understanding of
the Islamic religion could ``help us overcome such ignorance and
stereotyping as we have of the people of Islam.''
   Moslems believe, as do Christians and Jews, in one God, Jenco
said. And that common belief could be used to foster justice and
human rights throughout the world, he said.
   Jenco outlined the tenets of the Islamic faith to an audience of
about 300 at Carroll College in opening a three-day conference
entitled ``Prophecy and Politics.''
   Jenco was released in July 1986 after 564 days of captivity.
   ``Muslims, Christians and Jews are all followers of the same
living God,'' he said, adding that the ``trialogue'' among the
three religions must continue.

<HEAD>Ancient Route to China Is Busy Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TASHKARGAN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient road traveled by the likes
of Genghis Khan, Marco Polo and Babur has become an active artery
of commerce today between China and Pakistan.
   More than 2,000 years ago, silk and spices made their way out of
China on the route, while gold, silver and wool made their way in.
   The commerce today is considerably more diverse, if not as
exotic.
   As many as 80 Pakistani merchants travel the road into China
each day in battered buses to buy silk, porcelain and pearls, and
Chinese businessmen head in the opposite direction toward the
Khunjerab Pass on the border as part of a barter arrangement
between the two countries.
   The barter enables the Chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment,
farm tools, textiles, quilts and porcelain for Pakistani
cigarettes, medical herbs, dried fruits, shoes and razor blades.
   The volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of
$3 million in the past year, compared to $300,000 in 1986,
according to Sadeq Malek, sales officer of Pakistan's Northern
Areas Traders Cooperatives.
   The road also is being traveled more and more by tourists.
   From Pakistan's border post of Sost the road follows the Hunza
River, then runs along the icy Khunjerab River into China, crossing
numerous glaciers. As it climbs to the Khunjerab Pass, it goes
through a series of narrow chasms and steep declines.
   At Tashkargan, the first Chinese town across the border, workmen
are building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number of
travelers passing through.
   Kamel Tahsin, manager of the government-run Pamir Hotel in
Tashkargan, said the new hotels will be more modern and better
equipped.
   ``Business is getting better,'' he said. ``So we have to add a
couple of wings to our hotel.''
   Tahsin is one of about 12,000 people in Tashkargan who are
Shiite Moslem Tajiks, the tribe dominant in the area. They are
distinguishable by their sharp features and their women by their
colorful costume.
   Across the border in Sost, Pakistanis also are building to meet
the growing flow of tourists.
   Assif Khan, a Pakistani government tourist official, said big
tour groups now travel to China four times a month compared to
twice a month a year ago.
   But it's a tough road to travel, says Amanollah Mogul, the bus
driver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth to
China.
   The Khunjerab Pass, he said, makes him dizzy.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Steve Wynn first visited here in
1952, sharing his father's dream of a flashy bingo parlor on a
patch of desert called the Strip, $5 million could have bought the
clump of casinos that captivated the 10-year-old.
   Today, Wynn is spending more than a hundred times that amount on
a desert paradise that staggers even his immense imagination _ a
new Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.
   The youngster who was star-struck by this neon fantasyland 36
years ago has become Nevada's golden boy. With a penchant for
pizazz and a flair for doing deals, he promises the best is yet to
come for the city that sent his father back to Maryland in 1952,
nursing busted dreams.
   ``You ain't seen nothin' yet,'' boasted Wynn, chairman of Golden
Nugget Inc. and listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 800 most
powerful executives in America.
   Equally at home in the boardroom or at the blackjack table, Wynn
has taken the Golden Nugget from a honky-tonk casino in downtown's
Glitter Gulch to one of the nation's premier gaming companies with
revenues of about $190 million a year. And he's betting $550
million that his new resort, scheduled to open in the summer or
fall of 1989, will be ``a wonderment the world will flock to see.''
   Wynn already has $200 million invested in the Golden Nugget
downtown, where the Las Vegas gaming industry was born. He says his
new 3,300-room property on the Strip, now attracting a more upscale
breed of gambling visitor, is the forerunner to other giant
developments there.
   ``For half a billion dollars, you could have owned the entire
state of Nevada,'' Wynn said, comparing his blossoming resort with
his first visit to Las Vegas in the '50s.
   His father, Michael, hoped to open a bingo parlor on the
sparsely-settled Strip in those days, but a downtown casino heard
of his plans and opened its own operation, forcing Wynn and his son
to return East. Ironically, that casino was the Golden Nugget.
   Steve Wynn returned to Las Vegas in 1967 with a $35,000
bankroll. He engineered a deal with the late billionaire Howard
Hughes for a piece of land next to Caesars Palace, resold it to the
resort months later for a $1 million profit, and used that money to
buy into the Nugget.
   Today, that $1 million would hardly cause a ripple in this
gaming capital.
   ``We've already invested more money in this property (downtown)
than the entire capital expenditure of the city of Las Vegas,''
Wynn said in a recent interview in his office atop the downtown
resort.
   ``The enormous megabuck investment is not only necessary, it has
become the safest route to take,'' Wynn said. ``We've learned that
a destination resort like Las Vegas is the perfect launching pad
for bigger and better projects. This place is a big, huge, roaring,
successful destination resort, with people coming from all around
the world.''
   With nearly 17 million visitors expected in 1988 and tourism
growing at a double-digit pace each year, Wynn says Golden Nugget
won't be the last giant property built on the booming Strip, where
20,000 new hotel rooms are under construction or planned.
   Wynn admits he suffered from an attack of cold feet seven years
ago when he shelved plans for a similar project, down the Strip
from his present development.
   ``I started one of these babies for $400 million in 1981 and
chickened out,'' Wynn recalled. ``We didn't know the impact of New
Jersey on Nevada; we had a recession starting that scared the
dickens out of everybody. We didn't know how Las Vegas would handle
a recession; how it would handle a recession including Atlantic
City and deregulation of the airlines. There were no non-stop
flights here from the East Coast anymore.''
   ``Those questions were frightening, frightening enough for me to
say `Hey, I ain't gonna spend $400 million. We could make a
mistake.' Now, five, six years later, we saw what happened with the
recession _ practically nothing. We saw what happened with the
airlines; that hurt a little bit but we overcame it. We saw what
happened with Atlantic City _ $1.8 billion (in gambling) in Nevada
in 1979 to $5 billion today. Nobody dreamed there was that kind of
elasticity in America.''
   Wynn said he has already talked with Caesars chairman Henry
Gluck about joint ventures on major sporting events, particularly
boxing. When completed late next year, the Nugget and Caesars will
occupy a one-mile stretch of the famous Strip.
   Wynn bristles at competitor Donald Trump's claim that Atlantic
City has stolen from Las Vegas the title of boxing capital of the
world. Trump has, in recent months, landed the Mike Tyson-Larry
Holmes fight and the upcoming Tyson-Michael Spinks bout.
   ``He'd better make that claim while he can, because he won't be
able to make it long,'' Wynn vowed.
   The two gaming giants are hardly best of friends. Trump has been
quoted as calling Wynn a ``classic underachiever.'' Wynn has called
Trump ``twinkle toes.''
   The two were competitors when Wynn owned the Golden Nugget in
Atlantic City. Wynn's sale of the Atlantic City Nugget to Bally
Corp. for $440 million last year was a factor in blocking Trump's
efforts to take over Bally's.
   Months later, Trump announced he had bought a 4.9 percent stake
in Golden Nugget Inc. and indicated he might try to acquire
controlling interest in Wynn's company. Wynn still fumes over the
publicity Trump generated from that move.
   ``He did that for publicity and admitted it,'' Wynn growled.
``He never owned 5 percent. He owned 2 or 3 and he sold it right
away.''
   Will the new Nugget be locking horns with Trump for the big
fights? ``You bet we will,'' Wynn vowed.
   Wall Street analysts are generally high on Wynn and his
enthusiasm, but a little less confident about the gaming market's
capacity to support his dreams.
   Daniel Lee, an analyst for the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said Wynn's income estimates for the new resort may
be overly optimistic considering the competition on the Strip.
   ``The big uncertainty is what that casino can do,'' Lee said.
``I think it will be successful because of Steve Wynn.''

   Almost daily, the 2,500 workers at
Tadzhiktextilmash are told of the blessings of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reforms, their freedom to arn more _ and the
need to work harder.
   And all this has many at the sprawling machinery works in Soviet
Central Asia deeply worried about their paychecks, which average
230 rubles ($380) a month.
   ``Yes, comrades are concerned,'' acknowledged Abdumansour
Abdurashidov, Communist Party chief at the factory in the capital
of Tadzhikistan. ``When there is change, the change creates worry.
And there have been a lot of changes.''
   Since Gorbachev became Communist Party leader in March 1985, the
tenets of a half-century of top-heavy, bureaucratic management ``by
command'' have been shaken and new concepts introduced.
   Notions like profitability, the desirability of foreign
investment, individual enterprise and salary differentials to
reward achievement _ all once denounced as symptoms of capitalist
exploitation, are now treated with respect as the Soviet leadership
struggles to revive a vast but stagnant economy.
   So great has been the shock of Gorbachev's campaign for
``perestroika,'' or full-scale economic restructuring, that some
Soviets have been wondering whether they are still living in a
socialist state.
   ``Some are panicking. There are people who think everything is
collapsing,'' Gorbachev said last month. ``Now it seems to some
that socialism is vanishing.''
   In microcosm, the Tadzhiktextilmash factory, which makes a gamut
of products from cotton-spinning machines to cookware and electric
ranges, shows the challenges confronting Gorbachev and his allies
as they strive to streamline and modernize the nation's economy.
   Managers here talk convincingly about the pressing need for
``perestroika.'' But, as it is at other factories across the
country, the reform drive seems so far to have yielded very meager
results, except in words.
   In January, more than 76,000 factories and farms responsible for
60 percent of the country's output were subjected to a new law that
requires them to depend on their own earnings, rather than
injections of government funds, for operating revenue.
Tadzhiktextilmash was not among them.
   ``We are not ready yet to work on full economic
self-accounting,'' Valery N. Vozhdayev, the enterprise's
chain-smoking director for engineering, said in a recent interview.
``We're also not ready to have direct sales ties with foreign
firms.''
   Only 8 percent of Tadzhiktextilmash's multifaceted product line
is exported, and most of its clearly outmoded products could never
hope to compete in a free market. ``When we can sell our cotton
spinners in the United States, the situation will be normal,''
Vozhdayev said.
   Gorbachev's rise to power in the Soviet Union has wrought many
and varied transformations, but none has been more dramatic than in
the demands made on the 130 million-member labor force, including
the men and women of Tadzhiktextilmash.
   Socialism, Gorbachev-style, means letting local managers make
more decisions, pegging wages more closely to job performance and,
in theory at least, the shutting down of factories that run in the
red or can't cope with the rules of the new economic game.
   For Tadzhiktextilmash lathe operators and management personnel,
and for the rest of the Soviet labor force, this means there will
be winners and losers in the economic game, based on how they
perform their jobs.
   ``The No. 1 concern of workers is for their salary, and how it
will be changed under self-accounting,'' said Abdurashidov.
``Secondly, they are worried about the conditions of work, and how
they might change.''
   The impetus for abandoning the egalitarianism and uniform
salaries of the past comes from the very top. ``The person who
works harder should live better,'' Gorbachev has said. ``The
hard-working person, and labor, is of this morality.''
   Gorbachev has said repeatedly that perestroika is not a retreat
from socialism, but a bold move forward.
   Under the reforms, he said last month, Soviet socialism ``is
ridding itself of everything that had deformed it in the past, and
is demonstrating tremendous dynamism, the wealth of its social and
humanistic content.''
   In the economic field at least, the results thus far of the
Kremlin's campaign for restructuring do not support such a rosy
statement.
   In the first three months of 1988, state-run enterprises had
trouble meeting the country's needs in many fields, from shoes to
machine tools, the government said in a sobering report in April.
   Despite state-enforced quality checks, shoddy goods are still
rife. In the first three months of this year alone, defective color
television sets stamped ``Made in U.S.S.R.'' ignited 180 fires that
killed four people.
   A spring sale in Moscow of Czechoslovak shoes, judged more
elegant than locally made footwear, drew a line of thousands, while
official media said millions of pairs of Soviet shoes sat on store
shelves because they were badly made or already out-of-fashion when
produced.
   Demand still regularly outstrips supply. In early 1988, there
was a shortfall of 44,000 vacuum cleaners and as many washing
machines from plan targets set by state bureaucrats.
   A worldwise comment heard recently in Moscow goes: ``Be thankful
that mushrooms grow wild in Russia, because if the government
starts to grow them, there won't be any.''
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that perestroika has brought little
change in the Soviet living standard so far. What's more, the
perennial concerns of the Soviet citizenry, like finding some fresh
meat or a warm winter coat, have now been joined by worries that
once were thought to have been banished along with capitalism.
   Soviet economists have said more than 16 million people will be
laid off in the next 12 years as factories, deprived of state
subsidies, are forced to trim their payrolls and government
ministries slash bureaucratic fat.
   Sweeping price rises also are foreseen in the 1990s to cut the
84 billion rubles ($134 billion) the government now spends annually
to keep down the cost of bread and other basic goods.
   To many Soviets, those looming spectres of unemployment and
inflation are exactly what socialism was supposed to guard against.
``It's like long-forgotten times are repeating themselves,'' one
worried Muscovite wrote Pravda earlier this year.
   Nonetheless, the Kremlin leadership says there is no alternative
to its blueprint for rejuvenating the economy, and it has been
making room in the pantheon of economic heroes, alongside the
Stakhanovite ``shock workers'' of the past, for the farsighted
Soviet entrepreneur who takes risks.
   One example: a firm in the Ukrainian port of Odessa that cans
fruit, juices and jams had thousands of excess cans sitting around
its warehouses. It wanted to unload them, and a newly founded
cooperative saw the chance to make a quick ruble.
   The co-op bought the cans for 10 kopecks apiece, put labels on
them that said ``Odessa Air,'' and sold them on April Fool's Day
for up to 5 rubles apiece.
   That, the government daily Izvestia enthusiastically noted last
month, is ``a living illustration of the possibilities of free
initiative.''

   In the era of ``glasnost,'' a sentence to years of
hard labor in a Soviet prison camp is not the automatic response to
dissent. Greater debate on some topics is allowed. But there are
still limits.
   For all the talk about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy
of openness and tolerance, political prisoners remain in jails. And
longtime refuseniks, repeatedly denied permission to leave, say
they are worn out.
   ``As long as people are sitting in prison camps and people
aren't allowed to emigrate, fear won't be cleansed from the soul,''
said Lev Timofeyev, a journalist and economist.
   When Timofeyev wants to criticize Soviet authorities, he writes
his comments into his Toshiba computer and runs them off on his
Kodak printer. Not long ago, that would have been inconceivable,
technologically and politically.
   Timofeyev was arrested shortly after Gorbachev took power in
March 1985 and sentenced to 11 years in prison camp and exile for
urging economic reform in a book published abroad. He was released
two years later.
   And though he now is free, along with hundreds of others, he
still speaks of a ``zone of fear'' among the dissidents.
   Beginning with the release of Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D.
Sakharov in December 1986 from exile in Gorky, Gorbachev moved to
quiet critics of his country's human rights policies. Hundreds of
people were released from jails and prison camps in 1987.
   Dissidents now express themselves in unofficial publications on
topics ranging from freedom of religion to ecology and women's
issues. Editors of 30 such publications, often only a few
irregularly produced sheets of carbon paper, gathered unhindered in
Moscow in early May.
   Computers still are not widely in use in Soviet society.
Timofeyev says he received his small computer and printer from
friends, and about 500 copies of each edition of the twice-monthly
journal ``Referendum'' can be produced.
   That is few for a country of 280 million people, Timofeyev
acknowledged. ``We need a Xerox,'' he said. ``We need a laser
printer. Then we'd be able to put out an edition.''
   But the government owns all printing facilities in the Soviet
Union, and access to copying machines is guarded closely.
   Refuseniks are looking for a new voice to present their demands
and hope for a boost from President Reagan when he comes to Moscow
at the end of May.
   Michael Stolar, who with his father Abe holds an American
passport, said it would be ``murderous'' for refuseniks if Reagan
does not draw attention to their cause because it would give the
Soviet Union the impression that the United States no longer cares.
He and his father have been granted permission to leave, but remain
because Michael's wife Julia cannot get an exit visa.
   Tanya Zieman, 48, and her husband Yuri have been refused
permission to emigrate for 11 years. Despite an increase in Jewish
emigration last year to more than 8,000, she is convinced it is not
in the interest of Soviet authorities to resolve the emigration
issue.
   ``What are they going to bargain with?'' she said. Longtime
refuseniks are ``in a terrible state physically and emotionally,''
she said. ``They're worn out.''
   Dissident leaders like Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Koryagin have left
the country. Anatoly Marchenko died in Chistopol prison in December
1986 weeks before Sakharov was freed.
   Sakharov, the most authoritative voice on human rights in the
Soviet Union, has settled since his almost seven years in exile
into a quieter life devoted to physics and a few selected social
issues. He rarely seeks contact with foreign correspondents, but
has gained acceptance in the Soviet press that once vilified him.
   Sakharov says he has ``a great opinion of Gorbachev as a
government figure and in personal terms.'' He met Jan. 15 with
Gorbachev and handed him a list of 200 political prisoners.
   Dissident sources say 200 is a minimum number of people who
still are imprisoned for their beliefs, but they cannot say
accurately how many political prisoners there are.
   Although the government response to dissent has been somewhat
more tolerant than in the past, there are strict limits that
prevent dissidents from spreading their ideas across the vast
country.
   Authorities seized about 70 copies of former political prisoner
Sergei Grigoryants' ``Glasnost'' journal last fall, claiming they
had been printed illegally at a government-owned press.
   In early May, dissidents said police seized another 400 copies
of Grigoryants' publications, jailed the dissident leader for seven
days and prevented his editorial office from hosting a meeting at
which dissidents founded what they said is an alternative to the
Communist Party.
   Meetings of that group, the Democratic Union, were followed
closely by police but not broken up. Instead police detained dozens
who came from outside Moscow to the meetings, and let them go after
a short time.
   Dissidents and refuseniks planning demonstrations often are
detained before they can get to the protest site. Those who manage
to hoist protest banners often have them ripped up. They are taken
away by police, but usually freed in a few hours.
   Sometimes protests are allowed to proceed peacefully, like a
refusenik demonstration on the steps of the Moscow visa office in
late April. Other protests, such as one across from the Foreign
Ministry building during the Washington summit between Reagan and
Gorbachev in December, have been dispersed violently.
   New laws in Moscow and many other places make it possible to
seek a permit for a legal demonstration, but refuseniks and
dissidents have found it is almost impossible to receive permission.
   Soviet authorities also are faced with another area of dissent
that Gorbachev has said could be the most serious _ the rise of
national sentiments among some of the country's more than 100
ethnic groups.
   Serious ethnic unrest is known to have occurred in Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Armenia, and there has been an increase in ethnic
feelings in the Baltic states.
   Gorbachev has called for a meeting of the policy-making
Communist Party Central Committee to discuss the issue.
   One Armenian nationalist, Paryur Ayrikyan, has been arrested and
is said to be under investigation for spreading false information
about the Soviet Union. That law is one of several used most
frequently in the past against dissidents, who say how authorities
proceed against Ayrikyan will tell them much about the official
attitude in the future.

   All three sons were on their best
behavior. Homemade berry liqueur had been poured neatly into seven
tiny glasses, and the table was resplendent with carefully crafted
hors d'oeuvres of salted fish, canned meats and pickled vegetables.
   Olga Chuikov _ wife, mother, economist and Communist Party
activist _ beamed with pride over the table spread lavishly for her
family and the three strangers her friend Lena invited for dinner
with only a few hours' warning.
   Smoothing the skirt of her crimson knit dress and nervously
touching the cluster of curls neatly pinned on the crown of her
head, Olga raised her glass.
   ``What should we drink to?'' asked the hostess, searching her
family and guests with expectant brown eyes. ``There's so much we
are hoping for. It's difficult to decide.''
   Her neighbors and co-workers probably would say Olga has
everything. She and Viktor, her husband of 15 years, have a healthy
family, a four-room apartment, a red Neva car and a summer cottage
in the country. They are as successful and thriving in Soviet
society as were Ozzie and Harriet or the Cleavers, the television
families that celebrated American life in the 1960s.
   A Westerner, like the American journalist brought over by Olga's
friend, party secretary Lena Ivankovich, might have guessed that
Olga hoped for material things: a washing machine, stereo or
fashionable pair of shoes.
   But the hostess, a slender and attractive woman in her mid-30s,
raised her glass and wished for her sons to grow up seeing
Americans as friends, not enemies, for the two governments to stop
posturing and get down to the business of disarmament, for a
peaceful and wholesome future for her family.
   So began a long night of storytelling and exploration that would
teach the Chuikovs about American lifestyles and give the American
a glimpse of the concerns and values of a patriotic and
hard-working Siberian family.
   Olga's and Viktor's curiosity spills out in a flood of questions
about everyday life in a land they've always heard about but
probably will never see.
   ``I know our media often give a negative picture of life in
America,'' Olga began, diplomatically. ``How do Americans see us?
Is it true that they think we are an aggressive society?''
   The level in the liqueur bottle dropped as the debate and
laughter escalated, and Viktor produced a bottle of Armenian cognac
to sustain the conviviality into the early hours of morning. The
boys were told to go to bed, but they stalled in the corners and
doorways of the room, fascinated by the exchange of lifestyle
trivia.
   How much does an American journalist earn each month? How much
does it cost for an apartment? Why do Americans say disrespectful
things about their president? Do the homeless and unemployed
literally starve on the street, or are there places where they can
get help?
   The questions themselves tell a lot about Soviet life. Personal
finances are as popular a subject of discussion as the weather, and
Soviets don't hesitate to ask questions about salary, savings or
debt.
   The Chuikovs _ Olga, Viktor, the boys and Olga's father, Vasily
_ are comparatively well off for a Soviet family. Together, they
have an income of more than 800 rubles a month (about $1,350). That
is four times the wage of an average industrial worker, and their
apartment in the center of this Siberian boomtown is spacious by
any Soviet standard.
   Living space is in extremely short supply and is distributed to
families, usually for life, with the right to pass on an apartment
as inheritance. It's not unusual for a family of four to be housed
in a one- or two-room apartment, and many rooms in Soviet
households serve as dining room, living room and bedroom as the day
progresses.
   Soviets pay about 3 percent of their salary for rent, with the
location and size of the living space playing little part in the
pricing system.
   The Chuikovs were surprised to learn Americans usually pay about
one quarter of their monthly income for housing. But they were even
more intrigued that most middle-class working people live in
separate homes, rather than in apartments, and that homes and
apartments sometimes stand empty for months for want of a tenant or
buyer.
   Suburban living perplexed them, since homes on the outskirts of
a city lack prestige in the Soviet Union. Even in the major cities,
the outer areas are seldom connected to municipal water, heating or
sewer systems. Outhouses and treks to community wells are daily
facts of life within five miles of the Moscow city limits.
   Food costs account for a greater share of the Soviet family's
budget than for Americans, the Chuikovs calculated. They were
tickled by the concept of sprawling grocery stores where it takes
an entire aisle to display all the different brands of coffee or
breakfast cereal.
   ``You just can't buy these things here,'' Olga said. ``We built
up our heavy industries after the war, putting out farm equipment
and industrial machines by the ton, but we haven't paid much
attention to the things we need in everyday life.''
   The tugs of career and homemaking are felt by parents in both
nations, the women agreed, with Viktor and his male guests
grudgingly conceding that the lot of the Soviet working mother is a
tough one.
   ``Does your husband cook for himself and shop for food?'' Olga
wanted to know, casting a reproving look at her husband.
   Soviet homes are devoid of the gadgets that get the American
cook through a meal or the weekly laundry. Olga and Lena are well
educated and well read and had heard of microwave ovens, but they
shook their heads in wonder when told refrigerated leftovers could
be reheated in five minutes.
   Free time and priorities for spending it further underscored
differences between the two lifestyles. Soviet women spend an
average of eight hours a day waiting in lines to buy food and
performing the household chores still shunned by most men.
   Tynda, however, is spared much of the queuing that eats up spare
time in other cities. As the remote Siberian base from which the
Baikal-Amur Railroad is pushing east, the town must truck in
virtually everything it needs. There's no need to search each
store. Cabbage or an electric iron is either available or it's not.
   Soviets generally are more culturally inclined than most
Americans, standing in line for hours or cashing in on past favors
to get tickets to the theater or symphony. Every book is a
cherished possession, and television is something they turn to for
news rather than entertainment, perhaps because programming is
repetitive and of low quality.
   ``As a mother I have to say I don't understand how Americans can
condone violence and anti-Sovietism in films that children can
see,'' Olga said. ``How does this constitute freedom of speech?''
   Rambo and Rocky IV drew the traditional denunciations from the
six adult Soviets, although none had seen either of the films.
   The Chuikovs said their 13-year-old twins spend many
after-school hours in sports, but that the shortage of consumer
services that plagues most of the country is especially hard on
Siberians.
   ``There are not enough music teachers, so they can take only the
most talented, and unfortunately none of my children has
distinguished himself,'' Olga lamented. ``But all the same, I'd
like them to be musically literate.''
   School and work loomed only a few hours in the future, so the
small-scale cultural exchange drew to a reluctant close.
   ``We hope we didn't tire you with so many questions,'' Olga
said. ``It's just such a rare treat to see America through an
American's eyes.''

<TEXT>
   The National Party, which made
apartheid law in South Africa, this week marks 40 years of unbroken
rule. In that time, it has helped create Africa's most modern state
and one of the world's most divided and ostracized nations.
   On May 26, 1948, to the surprise of its own Afrikaner faithful,
the party won a narrow majority in the whites-only Parliament. Its
subsequent hold on power is one of the longest ever among countries
with multiparty elections.
   The party's tactics and constituency have changed over the
years, but its primary objective remains constant _ to preserve the
white minority's political and economic paramountcy.
   ``Forty years of National Party rule have brought us to a sorry
state indeed,'' wrote Joyce Harris, former president of the Black
Sash civil rights group, in a recent article.
   ``It has pursued its blinkered apartheid policy with no regard
to its effects on the country and the vast majority of its people.
... It has successfully followed a policy of divide and rule.''
   President P.W. Botha, the National Party's leader since 1978,
says apartheid is ``an outdated concept'' now and is being
dismantled in phases. He and his loyalists depict the party as a
proponent of racial reform, using rhetoric that would have been
heretical to Nationalists 20 years ago.
   The party still stresses, however, that its vision of
power-sharing does not include any scenario where blacks, who make
up 75 percent of the population, could overrule whites on matters
of vital national interest.
   People officially classified as being Asian or of mixed races
now have their own Parliament, but all the major legislation
resides with the white Parliament.
   The policy of slow-paced, limited reform has induced large
numbers of English-speaking South Africans to desert more liberal
parties and support the National Party.
   But the talk of reform has driven an even larger number of
pro-apartheid Afrikaners into the ranks of the far-right
Conservative Party, which emerged from the 1987 white election as
the main opposition in Parliament.
   ``The National Party is no longer the political arm of Afrikaner
nationalism,'' says Harald Pakendorf, a moderate Afrikaner
political columnist. ``It and the Conservative Party have an almost
equal share of support from Afrikaners.''
   When the National Party was formed in 1914, it was intended
solely as a vehicle for promoting the interests of Afrikaners, the
descendants of the Dutch, French and Germans who settled in South
Africa in the 17th century.
   Today, Afrikaners make up 60 percent of the 5 million whites,
and their economic and educational levels are largely comparable to
English-speaking South Africans. But after losing to the British in
the Boer War (1899-1902), many Afrikaners felt dominated culturally
and politically by English-speakers, who as a whole were richer and
better educated.
   The hardcore Nationalists stuck with the young party in 1934
when many of its leaders formed a broadbased alliance with
English-speaking politicians under the banner of the United Party.
   Entering the 1948 election, the National Party had 49 seats in
the 153-member Parliament. It campaigned on a platform of strict
racial segregation, and few experts believed it could oust the
United Party.
   South Africa broke away from the British-led Commonwealth and
declared itself a republic May 31, 1961. This was a major issue for
the National Party, and it narrowly won a referendum in October
1960, with 52 percent of the voters supporting the breakaway.
   But, in what The Star newspaper of Johannesburg described at the
time as a ``political convulsion,'' the Nationalists won a
five-seat majority. D.F. Malan, a stern former pastor, became prime
minster and established the first all-Afrikaner Cabinet.
   Over the next few years, the new government consolidated its
powers through the allocation of civil service jobs to Afrikaners
and laid the legislative groundwork for apartheid.
   By 1950, interracial sex and marriages had been banned, and two
of the laws that today form the cornerstones of apartheid had been
enacted. These are the Group Areas Act, which mandates segregated
residential districts, and the Population Registration Act, which
requires racial classification of all South Africans _ white,
black, Asian or ``colored'' (mixed race).

   The goal, explained National Party policymakers, was to
eliminate friction between the races. A separate education system
was created, and hundreds of thousands of blacks were forcibly
moved to homelands where, in theory, they could practice limited
self-government.
   ``The calling of this small nation is to give to the world the
basis and pattern on which different races can live in peace and
safety in the future, each within its national circle,'' said Daan
De Wet, a Cabinet minister, in 1959.
   Even before 1948, non-whites' freedoms were limited. For
example, they could not vote or own farmland in ``white'' areas.
But only after 1948 were they restricted by a vast array of major
and minor discriminatory laws that changed the siutation from de
facto to legalized segregation.
   In addition to the Group Areas Act, Population Registration Act,
Mixed Marriages Act, the new government took numerous other steps.
Under the Separate Amenities Act of 1953, separate entrances were
provided for whites in railway stations, post offices and other
government buildings. Special hospitals and beaches were set aside.
Whites and non-whites were forbidden to sit on the same benches in
parks and at bus stops.
   Other National Party laws formalized the segregation of trains
and buses. In the past five years, there has been a trend toward
desegregation, affecting restaurants, cinemas, hotels, but
segregation, both enforced and de facto, remains pervasive.
   Edward Perkins, who in 1986 became the first black U.S.
ambassador to South Africa, has remarked that apartheid, which in
Afrikaans means ``separateness,'' has achieved its purpose.
   ``The sad fact is that the policy of apartheid has been all too
successful,'' Perkins said in December. ``It ranks as one of this
century's most disastrous feats of social engineering.''
   Critics of the National Party acknowledge that
government-sanctioned racial discrimination was pervasive in South
Africa long before 1948. But Joyce Harris, the former Black Sash
leader, argues that the Nationalist takeover came at a time when
Western countries were becoming increasingly conscious of
individual rights.
   ``It was precisely then that South Africa parted company with
the Western world and turned its face in the opposite direction,''
she wrote. ``At that time, our country was a respected member of
the Western world and South Africans could hold up their heads and
walk with pride anywhere.''
   Politically, the high-water mark for the National Party came in
1977 when it gained 64 percent of the vote in the white election.
Last year, its share of the vote dropped to 52 percent, but a
favorable districting system enabled it to win 123 of the 166
contested Parliament seats for its 10th consecutive general
election triumph.
   Despite the far-right's extensive gains, few political experts
are predicting an early end to the National Party's reign. There is
a widespread sense of irony in the perception that the party's
future now hinges on its ability to co-opt blacks, rather than
isolate them.
   Botha himself touched on this matter in April when he proposed
black participation in Cabinet-level policymaking.
   ``If the white people do not wish to follow my way, it is their
responsibility,'' he said. ``If they follow the way of
confrontation, it is their problem.''

   Attention Rambo fans: Coming soon to a store
near you _ the Rambo bowie knife, 17 deadly inches long with a
Damascus steel blade, ebony handle and top-grain leather sheath.
Just $2,250.
   You can also get your Rambo action dolls, Rambo survival
watches, Rambo camouflage makeup, a full line of posters,
calendars, comic books and headbands and, for the first time this
year, ``Rambuddha'' necklaces _ plastic replicas of the rugged
hero's jade Buddha charm.
   Behind the hype is Carolco Pictures Inc., the producer of the
Rambo movies, including ``Rambo III,'' which makes its
action-packed debut this month.
   Carolco not only brought he-man actor Sylvester Stallone to the
role and Rambo to the screen, it also controls movie and video
rights to the series and sells the right to make Rambo
paraphernalia to producers of toys, weapons and the like.
   Rambo has been good to Carolco.
   In worldwide ticket sales alone, the first Rambo movie earned
$120 million and the second is closing on $300 million, according
to Kathryn Linclau, Carolco's vice president for marketing.
   Analysts say ``Rambo III'' will make at least $160 million at
the box office in the United States alone, and that's before the
profits start rolling in from videocassette and television rights,
and the fees from some 70 licenses for Rambo products.
   For fans who can't afford the top-of-the line replica of the
knife Vietnam vet John Rambo uses to dispatch his foes on his new
foray into Soviet-dominated Afghanistan, there will be a stainless
steel version for $1,000 and a ``utilitarian'' version for $125.
   New this year will be Rambo Trading Units, gold and silver
``survival currency'' $5, $10 and $20 denominations selling for $59
to $598, said Danny Simon, who's in charge of licensing for Carolco.
   And yes, Linclau added, ```Rambo IV' will be a reality.''
   On all its operations last year, Carolco made a profit of $11.4
million on sales of $36.4 million, and most of that rode in on
Rambo's broad shoulders.
   Stallone has his own production company for the ``Rocky'' movies
and other ventures, but Carolco owns ``Rambo,'' and the star is on
the payroll _ in a big way.
   Stallone reportedly gets $16 million plus a piece of the
almost-certain profit from ``Rambo III.''
   But that's money well spent, according the Jeffrey Logsdon, an
analyst who follows show business for the Los Angeles investment
company, Crowell, Weedon & Co.
   ``He is really playing the role of writer, director, star and
creative consultant,'' Logsdon said. ``When you have that kind of
bankable talent, you're going to have to pay a premium.''
   Production costs traditionally are made public only through
informed speculation, and the trade paper, Daily Variety, pegs
``Rambo III'' at $63 million. Carolco president Peter Hoffman
called the estimate high, but refused to give another figure.
   Logsdon suggests ``Rambo III'' likely cost $57 million or $58
million to make. Those estimates put ``Rambo III'' among the most
expensive movies of all time.
   ``War and Peace,'' made in 1966, cost $100 million in 1966
dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times, while more recent
non-adjusted figures include those for ``Annie'' (1982), $51.5
million; ``Cotton Club'' (1984), $51 million; and ``Ishtar''
(1987), $45 million.
   Carolco, which first sold stock to the public in November 1986,
is truly the house that Rambo built. But management is trying, with
mixed success, to add a few new rooms.
   The company produced such box-office yawns as ``Extreme
Prejudice,'' with Nick Nolte and Powers Booth, and ``Angel Heart,''
noted chiefly for a controversial nude scene between Mickey Rourke
and TV's ``Cosby'' kid Lisa Bonet.
   ``They weren't great successes in America,'' Linclau
acknowledged, ``but on the international level they were
profitable.''
   In the last year, Carolco has bought Orbis Communications, a TV
distribution and advertising sales company; IndieProd Co., maker of
the movies ``Footloose'' and ``Roxanne''; and International Video
Entertainment, a distributor of videocassettes.
   Carolco is bringing out another action film this summer, ``Red
Heat,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Belushi.
   ``They're doing all the right things, becoming less dependent on
one Rambo film every three years,'' Logsdon said. ``But there's no
one in Hollywood who doesn't envy them over that franchise.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The British Empire is no more, but the children

   Ben Okri first came to England in 1978 eager to
experience the land of Shakespeare and Dickens, two writers in a
literary tradition he had long admired.
   A decade and three books later, the 29-year-old Nigerian writer
is broadening that tradition. Okri represents the artistic
dividends Britain has reaped from its days of spreading its empire
and language throughout the world.
   Indeed, any literary critic listing the five greatest living
British writers would certainly include Trinidad-born V.S. Naipaul,
especially after his latest acclaimed best seller, ``The Enigma of
Arrival.''
   However, this multicultural vibrancy is not new. Such writers as
Nobelist Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and Samuel Selvon have been on
the scene for more than 20 years, opening readers' eyes to the
ethnic problems far removed from the domestic, bourgeois subject
matter often favored by Anglo-Saxon writers.
   What is new is the quantity of these so-called Commonwealth
artists _ sons and daughters of the almost vanished empire _ and
their increased visibility.
   Around 1960, the Nigerian-born Soyinka was testing the London
theater fringe with ``The Swamp Dweller'' and ``The Trials of
Brother Jero.'' In 1986, he won the Nobel Prize for literature, the
first black African to receive the honor.
   Achebe first won attention in 1958 with ``Things Fall Apart,'' a
tribal tragedy set in his native Nigeria which has sold more than 2
million copies. Last year, after a 20-year break from writing, his
``Anthills of the Savannah'' was nominated for the Booker prize,
Britain's most prestigious literary award.
   These older novelists are gaining numerous younger counterparts
including Okri and Buchi Emecheta from Africa, Salman Rushdie and
Vikram Seth from India, Timothy Mo from Hong Kong and Caryl
Phillips, Olive Senior and Derek Walcott from the West Indies.
   With the contributions of such artists as the
playwright-screenwriter Hanif Kureishi and actors Ben Kingsley, Art
Malik, Roshan Seth and Victor Banerjee, English culture's debt to
the Commonwealth is growing.
   ``We're looking at a world movement which covers every
conceivable theme,'' Alistair Niven, literature director at
London's Arts Council, said in an interview. ``One has to abandon
the notion of the Anglo-Saxon tradition. We're trying to
internationalize the view of literature in this country.''
   ``There's a growing awareness of these nations as nations in
their own right and also of the presence in England of a great many
people of Caribbean and African origin,'' said Lyn Innes, senior
lecturer in English and Afro-Caribbean Studies at the University of
Kent at Canterbury, one of a dozen British universities offering
Commonwealth literature courses.
   Where Commonwealth literature was once relegated to small
presses and limited print runs, it is now snapped up by mainstream
publishers and movie dealers and is alo receiving recognition from
the academic community.
   Indian-born Salman Rushdie, 40, won the 1981 Booker Prize for
his magical, panoramic novel, ``Midnight's Children,'' about
India's transition from colony to independence. He reportedly
received a $1.496 million advance for his next novel ``The Satanic
Verses,'' to be released in September.
   Mo's novel, ``Sour Sweet,'' set among London's Chinese
community, has been made into a $3.62 million movie. His best
seller, ``An Insular Possession,'' about the British in Hong Kong,
made the 1987 Booker list.
   Tim Cribb, director of English studies at Cambridge's Churchill
College, is leading a drive to raise $7.8 million for a chair in
Commonwealth studies.
   Many of the new novels deal with the disillusionment
Commonwealth immigrants suffer when they run into racism in Britain.
   Tanzanian-born Abdulrazak Gurnah, a faculty member at the
University of Kent, has just published ``Pilgrims Way.'' The novel
tells of an African immigrant named Daud who is drawn to Britain _
``the torch of wisdom and learning.'' Encountering persistent
racism, he finds his own small, personal triumph in a crushing
victory by the West Indian cricket team over England.
   The theme echoes Sam Selvon's 1956 ``The Lonely Londoners,''
whose main character, a Trinidadian, comes to London only to
discover that the home capital he had envisioned is in truth ``a
strange place on another planet.''
   In ``Disparities,'' an Okri short story, a Nigerian immigrant is
forced to sleep in subway stations and scavenge discarded yogurt
containers. He finds London ``a damn poxy place'' and its gentility
``an uneasy yoking of lies.''
   Some Commonwealth novels chart the sociological and identity
changes wrought by the end of empire.
   Caryl Phillips, in ``A State of Independence,'' describes
Bertram Francis returning to his newly independent West Indian
island after a 20-year absence and finding himself an alien.
Naipaul's ``The Enigma of Arrival,'' on the other hand, is an elegy
to the passing of ``the old England.''
   Nirad C. Chaudhuri's autobiographical ``Thy Hand, Great
Anarch!'' is a paean to Western civilization whose controversial
thesis is that India gained nothing by Britain's departure.
   Some English writers say they are spurred on by the blazing
assuredness of their Commonwealth colleagues and their looser
prose, which is rooted in an oral, story-telling tradition.
   ``There are a number of people, age 55 down to 30, who have
created a strong presence which has given me and other writers a
sense of British literature being global, not just insular,'' says
author Margaret Drabble.
   ``London now is one of the most cosmopolitan, most transcultural
cities in the world. It's very hard not to want to write about
that.''
   The Commonwealth presence is also felt in the performing arts
where attitudes are less open.
   Rita Wolf, the Bengali who starred in ``My Beautiful
Laundrette,'' complains that despite her experience, she has
difficulty getting work. Art Malik, the 35-year-old Anglo-Asian
actor, is only now beginning to get cast in non-ethnic roles,
following his compelling performance as the wronged Hari Kumar in
the hit TV series ``The Jewel in the Crown.''
   ``The problem is that in the minority area, every actor is a
minority of one, whether he be fat, thin, Chinese, a woman,'' Malik
said. ``If you're going to say we are a cosmopolitan society, you
have to go one step further.''
   More often, Commonwealth actors are expected to conform to
stereotypes, even if a few, such as the Academy Award-winner Ben
Kingsley, have built a career on uncompromising portrayals that
honor their own visions.
   In 1985 Kingsley, who is half-Indian, played Othello in a Royal
Shakespeare Company production as the robed North African, rather
than as the conventional elocutionary Englishman in blackface. He
won his Oscar for his portrayal of Gandhi.
   ``There are certain sensibilities in this country that I to my
dying day will never re-educate,'' Kingsley said. ``All I can take
with me is my version of the truth.''

   What Sir Edmund Hillary recalls most
vividly about standing at the top of Mount Everest 35 years ago is
the ice _ prickly, biting slivers of ice billowing around like a
white halo.
   ``They bore into your face, cutting and tingling,'' he said.
``And exhilarating.''
   On May 29, 1953, Hillary and the Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay
became the first men to conquer the world's tallest mountain.
   Neither Hillary nor Norgay, who died in 1986, ever said who got
there first.
   ``We reached it together, that's all,'' Hillary said in an
interview, abruptly ending any further discussion of the question.
   Since their ascent, 202 men and women have followed them up the
massive 29,028-foot mountain on the border of Nepal and Tibet.
   To many, Everest symbolizes the literal and figurative high
point of a mountaineer's career.
   But Hillary views it as ``a beginning rather than the end of
adventurous activity.''
   It won the New Zealander a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.
More important, he said, it earned him the financial backing to
climb scores of other peaks in the Himalayan chain, to trek to the
South Pole and even to go off on a lark, an unfruitful quest for
``yeti,'' the legendary abominable snowman.
   Hillary, now 68, now spends much of his time behind desks in the
capitals of India, Nepal and Bangladesh as New Zealand's ambassador
to all three countries.
   Although his broad shoulders and 6-foot-3-inch frame suggest he
could still take on Everest, he holds to trekking, hiking and other
lower-altitude sports.
   ``I'm finding the hills are getting steeper,'' he said.
   Friends, including the Indian teen-agers he has led on
white-water rafting trips and the tribal Sherpa children he visits
at mountain schools, call him ``Sir Ed.''
   Born Edmund Percival Hillary in Auckland on July 20, 1919, he
spent a good deal of his childhood reading adventure books and
daydreaming.
   ``There was a phase when I was the `fastest gun in the West,'
another when I explored the Antarctic,'' Hillary said. ``I would
walk for hours with my mind drifting to all these things.''
   There wasn't much money available in his family for adventure,
however. His father, a newspaper editor-turned-beekeeper, was
``energetic and very active but never very good at making money.''
   Hillary took up skiing in high school but didn't try climbing
until he was 19 or 20. His first summit was the 7,500-foot Mount
Olivier in southern New Zealand.
   ``It wasn't a difficult mountain by any manner or means, but
making it through the snow to the ridge, then along the ridge and
up to the summit really captured me,'' Hillary recalled. ``It was
then that I resolved I was going to do a lot more mountains. And I
did.''
   Hillary was already a veteran of numerous Indian Himalayan peaks
when he was asked to join a British expedition in 1951 to the
Everest region. The reconnaissance team explored the Khumbu glacier
and an ice fall in the shadow of the great mountain.
   ``We were the first to realize there was a potential route up
Everest from the south side,'' he said.
   Two years later, he and Norgay and 11 others set out with the
British Everest Expedition on that route. Hillary was 33 at the
time, Norgay 38. At least 14 expeditions before them had failed.
   Hillary said their equipment was less sophisticated than the
gear available now. Although they had early nylon ropes and oxygen
cylinders, they struggled with primitive, metal-spiked clampons for
their boots and ice axes that lacked the curve that facilitates
vertical climbing nowadays.
   There was also a psychological barrier: ``Physicians had warned
us that even if we got to the top with oxygen, we might collapse
and die because of the thin air.''
   Just short of the summit, Hillary and Norgay hit what appeared
to be an insurmountable obstacle, a vertical ``rock step'' 40 feet
high. Maneuvering carefully, they found a crack where the ice was
breaking away from the rock and eased their way up. The spot is
known to mountaineers today as ``Hillary's step.''
   Hillary says he is most often asked if reaching the summit was
accompanied by some religious or spiritual experience.
   ``For me, no,'' Hillary said. ``It was mostly a sense of
satisfaction and surprise actually.'' Norgay, he said, was more
emotional.
   ``I shook his hand,'' Hillary recalled. ``He threw his arms
around my shoulders and gave me a tremendous hug.'' Later, Norgay,
a Buddhist, buried bits of candy and biscuits in the snow as ``a
gift to the gods,'' Hillary said.
   Atop Everest, Hillary said, he quickly found his attention
turning to other unconquered peaks. With the ice particles cutting
into his face and frosting his cheeks, he scanned nearby Makalu
peak (27,807 feet) and worked out a climbing route.
   Hillary failed in an attempt on Makalu in 1954, but a French
team made it up several years later.
   If his vocation today is diplomacy and the outdoors, his
avocation is working to improve the lot of the poor Sherpa
tribesmen who live in the hills below Everest.
   Since 1961, he has raised about $200,000 a year to build
schools, hospitals and water systems for the Sherpas of Nepal.
   The effort has cost him more than time and energy. His wife
Louise and 16-year-old daughter Belinda were killed in a plane
crash in 1975 en route to join him at one of his Sherpa hospitals.
   His son Peter, 33, of Melbourne, Australia, makes his living as
a ski instructor and mountaineer. Peter has failed twice in efforts
to climb Everest. A daughter, Sarah, 31, is an art restorer in
Auckland.
   Thirteen people have climbed Everest more than once, including
the Nepali Sungdare Sherpa who has been to the top four times.
   But Hillary said he never had any desire to repeat the trip.
   ``There were so many other mountains.''

<HEAD>Illegal Foreign Fishing in Bering Sea Strains Coast Guard Patrols</HEAD>

   The view from the flight deck had not
changed all day: mile after mile of gray sky, gray water, and not a
fishing boat in sight.
   The four-engine C-130, its huge fuel tanks running low, finally
turned and headed for land.
   ``That was a perfectly boring patrol,'' said Joseph Koczur Jr.,
a National Marine Fisheries Service agent.
   ``Well, we learned where they aren't,'' the co-pilot, Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Mike Flood, said with a shrug.
   Chalk up another frustrating day for the ``fish cops'' of the
Bering Sea, who fight a losing battle guarding the nation's richest
deepwater fishery against raids by an elusive foreign fleet.
   This first leg of a two-day patrol covered a slice of ocean half
the size of Kentucky _ and, for the number of foreign vessels seen,
that's where the patrol may as well have been. Keeping the C-130
airborne for the day cost taxpayers $27,000.
   ``It's a big ocean,'' Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard's
commandant, said from his Washington office. ``It's like searching
for a needle in a haystack.''
   This year, it's like searching with one eye closed. Deficit
reduction measures have cut back on fishery patrols. Four years
ago, a C-130 would take off daily from the Coast Guard's base on
Kodiak Island; now it's more like once a week.
   American fishermen say the cuts come at a bad time, just as
they're finally claiming an area Congress made theirs in 1976 by
extending U.S. jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore. And foreign
fleets are not being polite about leaving the fishing grounds they
pioneered decades ago.
   By some estimates, foreign boats in the Bering Sea are illegally
catching up to $1 billion in fish each year, twice the amount
caught legally by Americans. Biologists worry that such poaching,
combined with unregulated fishing just outside the U.S. zone, may
threaten fish stocks.
   If a scale big enough could be found, the Bering Sea's hoard of
fish would weigh in at more than 30 billion pounds, a huge,
swimming feedlot that is 65 percent Alaska pollock and 35 percent
Pacific cod, yellowfin sole, sablefish and a smattering of other
species. Collectively known as bottomfish, they provide an annual
catch worth more than all other U.S. deepwater fisheries combined.
   For years, bottomfish were ignored by American fishermen seeking
salmon and crab. Foreigners, mainly Japanese, Koreans, Soviets and
Poles, valued the fish more highly. Starting in the 1940s, they
fished these distant waters with huge trawlers, depleting stocks of
some slow-growing species by the early 1960s.
   Management improved in 1976, when the U.S. Fishery Conservation
and Management Act established the 200-mile zone. The act also
created the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to regulate
harvests.
   Americans were given first shot at the bottomfish, but they had
neither the capital needed to build processing plants nor a market
for the finished product. By 1981, foreign boats still accounted
for 93 percent of the Bering Sea bottomfish harvest.
   Recently, more Americans have joined the bottomfish boom. Some
are drawn by a keener U.S. appetite for fish and by worldwide price
increases. Others, their crab boats idled by a drop in Alaska crab
populations, just want to stay in business.
   The fishery council has doled out progressively smaller catch
quotas to the foreign fleet. This year, for the first time,
American fishermen will catch all the fish within the 200-mile
limit, although 60 percent are still sold to foreign processing
ships.
   Foreign fishermen have been relegated to a triangle of high seas
known as the ``doughnut hole,'' a 45,000-square-mile pocket formed
by the boundaries of the U.S. 200-mile zone on the east and south,
and the Soviet convention line on the west.
   The foreign catch of pollock in the doughnut hole has soared,
from just over 4,000 metric tons in 1982 to an estimated 1 million
tons last year. That's close to the pollock catch allowed in the
rest of the Bering Sea.
   In addition to producing this legal catch, the doughnut hole has
become, in the words of Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, ``a
haven for bandits.''
   Just as fish ignore political boundaries, so do some foreign
fishermen. ``They've been fishing the Bering Sea since the end of
World War II,'' said NMFS agent Koczur. ``If they want to come in
and find fish, they know where to go.''
   On the second day of Koczur's mission, the C-130 reached the
patrol area and descended to 1,500 feet. Cockpit radar showed a
bright green dot 40 miles beyond the limit, dead ahead. Soon the
radar screen filled with dots.

   The plane descended to 600 feet, and the boats became visible,
dozens crowded into a few square miles. It dropped still lower, to
200 feet, and roared by the rigging of a rusty old boat with its
net in the water.
   Koczur recorded the vessel's call number, and fellow NMFS agent
Kenneth Hansen snapped a picture. It was a large Soviet stern
trawler, Koczur said.
   For 90 minutes, the pilots yanked and banked the plane, lining
up one boat after another for photographs, information collected
for files and future patrols. On some turns, it seemed a wing might
dip into the ocean.
   The navigator said he felt ill. The reporter turned pale. Pilot
and co-pilot chatted about eating raw fish. And Hansen and Koczur
kept snapping away. They counted 56 boats in all, a mix of
Japanese, Soviet and Polish trawlers.
   The boats continued to fish, knowing they were perfectly legal,
40 miles into the international waters of the doughnut hole.
   Koczur wondered aloud where the boats had been hours earlier.
Officials suspect foreign vessels use cover of darkness and storms
to sneak into U.S. waters. Fishermen have been known to duck into a
squall when they know the law is close, and boats have been spotted
with canvas tarps over their identifying numbers.
   Coast Guard efforts in this cat-and-mouse game have had limited
success. Since August 1986, 15 foreign vessels have been detected
fishing illegally in the 200-mile zone, Yost said. Patrols have
spotted hundreds more, but unless a boat has its net in the water,
it is considered legal.
   ``That is frustrating,'' Koczur said. ``We don't know they're
fishing, but why else would they be out there?''
   Why indeed, an angry Sam Hjelle asked last winter. Hjelle, the
Seattle-based owner of a Bering Sea trawler, met with the Coast
Guard last December to discuss illegal foreign fishing. He left the
meeting in disgust, and shortly afterward, he and other fishermen
tried their own remedy.
   On Jan. 12, Hjelle and Ted Evans, executive director of the
Alaska Factory Trawlers Association, chartered a twin-engine plane
for a two-day ``fishing expedition.''
   The fish vigilantes came back $17,000 poorer, but they got what
they were looking for: videotapes of seven Japanese vessels
allegedly fishing in U.S. waters.
   The tapes created an uproar, just as Hjelle and Evans had hoped.
The Senate passed a resolution condemning illegal fishing and
urging a moratorium on doughnut hole fishing. The State Department
demanded an explanation from the Japanese government, and the
Commerce Department fined three Japanese companies $100,000.
   Soviet and American negotiators last month renewed talks to
consider closing the doughnut hole to fishing _ a delicate issue
involving international law since neither country has jurisdiction
over the area.
   The negotiators have asked other fishing nations to consider a
moratorium. But the response has been weak, especially from Japan,
a fish-hungry nation that's seen traditional worldwide fishing
grounds shut off by nations declaring 200-mile limits.
   ``Japan has a long history in the Bering Sea, long before the
economic zone was claimed by Americans,'' said Katsuo Jodai of the
Japan Fisheries Association. ``... The doughnut hole is high seas.
It does not belong to any country.''
   So the cat-and-mouse game continues, and the mice have a greater
advantage than ever.
   In March, Yost announced that C-130 patrols from Kodiak would be
cut by 35 percent; cutter patrols by 55 percent. Yost he hopes an
interim funding measure working its way through Congress will boost
patrols this summer, but there's no guarantee of funding for next
year.
   The State Department, meanwhile, awaits a reply from the
Japanese on January's illegal fishing. The companies fined by the
Commerce Department have yet to pay. And their troublesome boats,
after dropping off their catch in Hokkaido, returned to fish the
Bering Sea.

<TEXT>
   Hunched over the steering wheel,
dressed in rubber boots and jeans, Paul Fuhs guided his bouncing,
mud-spattered truck along a rutted road past docks crowded with
fishing vessels.
   ``It's the most highly sophisticated fishing fleet in the
world,'' he boasted, waving toward the boats. ``There's nothing
like this anywhere else.''
   Fuhs, 39, an expert in underwater explosives, is the unpaid
mayor and chief booster of Unalaska _ a hotbed of high technology,
high finance and high hopes.
   The Aleutian village, with a permanent population of about
1,900, is awash in a wave of Bering Sea bottomfishing boom time.
U.S. vessels, along with cargo and processing ships from at least
14 other nations, crowd 80 square miles of harbor, jockeying to get
to 15 docks.
   ``In the first two weeks of the year we turned away 114 ships,''
Fuhs said. ``This has got to be the most exciting place in the
world right now.''
   Most of the bustle is centered on Dutch Harbor, located about
800 miles southwest of Anchorage on tiny Amaknak Island; it is part
of the town of Unalaska on the larger, sheltering Unalaska Island.
   Fuhs spends much of his time trying to persuade the state to
pump money into his wind-swept community _ to cash in on the boom
instead of asking, ``Dutch where? Bottom what?''
   The entire state would benefit, he says, if the fishing
industry's focus shifted north from Pacific Northwest ports.
   ``The state has no policy on bottomfishing,'' Fuhs said.
``Seattle has a strategy. Japan has a strategy. Everybody has a
strategy but us. Here we are, a tiny little town in the middle of
nowhere, and it's fallen in our laps. ... The Bering Sea could be a
perpetual Prudhoe Bay if we manage it properly.''
   Fuhs says state officials urge Unalaska to seek private
investment. But private investors, while indicating willingness to
build $60 million in warehouses, cold storage and processing
plants, first want the town to upgrade its sewer and water lines
and build a bigger dock.
   For that, Fuhs says, the town needs state money. ``We want
grunt-level infrastructure. We don't want a performing arts
center.''
   City Manager Nancy Gross says needed improvements in the World
War II-era water system alone could cost an estimated $30 million.
Much of the system is built of wood-stave pipes, which leak an
estimated 80 percent of the water pumped through them.
   ``The needs are just enormous,'' she said. ``Ten years ago, this
was a town of 500 to 600 people with very little industry.''
   Unalaska, unfortunately, needs money at a time when slumping oil
prices have squeezed the budget. Gov. Steve Cowper managed to find
$1.7 million for Unalaska sewer improvements in the last days of
the legislative session.
   Harbormaster Gary Daily believes the problem may be Unalaska's
remoteness. ``The same thing that gives us our advantage works
against us,'' he said. ``There's a lot of ignorance about what's
going on out here.''
   ``Out here'' is a frontier of sorts, where fists, brains and
hard work win respect. Unalaska has no full-time dentist, no
plumber, no appliance repair service, no doctor and no veterinarian
to deal with scores of free-roaming mutts.
   Milk costs $4.99 a gallon. A bottle of Jack Daniels sour mash
whiskey that sells for $20 in Anchorage goes for $39.50 here.
Softball and basketball are serious pursuits, and eagles are as
plentiful as vultures, fighting for space in the rigging of docked
vessels.
   Almost any language can be heard on the street.
   The Soviets are a favorite because they spend buckets on
stereos, gum, solar-powered watches and (nobody knows why) plastic
baby bottles. And they are enthusiastic merrymakers. ``They get
down and boogie,'' Daily said.
   Thirty-five Soviet vessels docked at Dutch Harbor last year; 40
are expected this year.
   Men outnumber women 5-1. Drugs, liquor and brawling are problems.
   ``These guys make a lot of money, and there is nothing to do
here,'' said 48-year-old Pete Davis, chief of the eight-man police
force. ``If they're so inclined, they can stick it up their nose or
pour it down their throats. Eighty-five percent of our work is
because of booze or drugs.''
   On the islands, the mountains wade into the sea; flat land goes
at a premium. There are 30-odd miles of car-killing dirt roads and
a 3,900-foot, heart-stopping gravel runway for planes.
   If it rains, there is mud. If not, choking dust.
   And there is money _ lots of money.
   The Bering Sea fisheries _ salmon, crab and bottom fish _
generate $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion a year. Fishermen get about
$400 million of that, with the rest going for the myriad services
needed to keep boats afloat.
   Only a few years ago, Unalaska was dead in the water. In 1982,
for reasons still not understood, stocks of red king crabs were
decimated. The harvest plummeted to 3 million pounds from a 1980
peak of 130 million. The 1983 season was canceled.
   The bottomfishing industry was then mostly in foreign hands, but
American fishermen turned to these less-valued fish to make a
living, aided by Congress' 1976 act establishing a 200-mile U.S.
coastal zone.
   Some say the crab crash may have been a blessing in disguise for
Unalaska. ``King crab was real seasonal,'' said Kathy Grimnes,
president of Ounalashka, the Aleut regional ative corporation.
Workers labored 14 hours a day, seven days a week.
   ``It was so busy you didn't have time to think,'' she said.
``The crash sort of put things on hold and allowed people to
evaluate their community.''
   Since then, Unalaska has put in parks and sponsored cultural
events. There is a bookstore. The school, with 150 students from
kindergarten through senior high, boasts an Olympic-sized swimming
pool.
   But the boom makes some residents fear that part of Unalaska is
dying.
   Jim Bacus drives a battered taxi. ``We can't drive our
three-wheelers anymore,'' he said. ``They used to let this dog
sleep on the floor of the Elbow Room. Now when dogs wander in they
chase them out. There's too many rules now.''
   Grimnes' corporation, a land development company, is busy
planning a 50-acre industrial park and may build a $5 million,
900-foot dock. But Grimnes admits something may be fading.
   ``It used to be that everybody used to wave to each other,'' she
said. ``Now we don't.''

<HEAD>Debate Continues Over House Un-American Activities Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Long before Joseph McCarthy's attacks on
Communists in the State Department, long before Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg were executed as spies and long before Winston Churchill
warned that an Iron Curtain had split East from West, the House
Committee on Un-American Activities was rooting out communism in
America.
   In the process, it also smeared the reputations of many innocent
people, turned friend on friend and attempted to twist the Fifth
Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination into an admission of
Communist affiliation.
   The committee will take its place in American history as ``a
moment of shame and hallucination,'' says historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr.
   Born 50 years ago on May 26, 1938, HUAC, as the headline-writers
called it, was the brainchild of a Jewish congressman from New York
who feared that Adolf Hitler's persecution of German Jews would, in
groups like the American Bund, make their way to the New World.
   Rep. Samuel Dickstein, D-N.Y., proposed that the group be formed
to hunt Nazis, not communists. But from the beginning, congressmen
who sat on the committee sought out fellow travelers, ``Comsymps''
and ``card-carrying Communists.'' Ironically, the anti-Semitism
that Dickstein so feared permeated even the halls of Congress; the
man who envisaged the committee was never seated on it.
   The committee, originally subject to annual approval, became a
fixture in January 1945 and lived on for another 30 years. It went
after labor unions, Hollywood personalities and opponents of the
Vietnam War. In its most celebrated case, it brought down Alger
Hiss, an on-the-rise New Dealer who had once been a law clerk to
Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, and raised the
fortunes of a young Republican congressman from California, Richard
Nixon.
   In 1975, Congress abolished HUAC. The panel's name had been
changed _ to the House Internal Security Committee _ but its time
had passed.
   In the beginning, though, the nation's mood was different. There
were fascists and communists in the country, which was slowly
trying to pick itself up from the Depression.
   At HUAC's first hearing in August 1938, chairman Martin Dies, a
Texas Democrat, made a promise that committee critics never forgot.
   ``We shall be fair and impartial at all times and treat every
witness with fairness and courtesy,'' Dies promised. ``This
committee will not permit any character assassination or any
smearing of innocent people. ... It is easy to smear someone's name
or reputation by unsupported charges or an unjustified attack, but
it is difficult to repair the damage that has been done.''
   Yet, no sooner did the committee begin its work than it began to
do exactly what Dies promised it wouldn't.
   ``In the days that followed, observers began to wonder whether
the lady of breeding who had made such a dignified entrance into
town was in fact setting up a bawdy house,'' Walter Goodman wrote
in his history of HUAC, ``The Commitee.''
   HUAC immediately launched an attack on the Federal Theater and
Writers Project, a New Deal program that seemed frivolous, even to
some supporters of Franklin D. Roosevelt, when so many Americans
were unemployed and hungry.
   The committee also had the facts on its side; there were
Communists in the Federal Theater. In June 1939, Congress abolished
the project.
   The committee turned its attention over the next few years to
labor unions and Hollywood, but for the most part, took a back seat
to World War II once America had entered the conflict.
   It picked up with renewed vigor, though, after the war ended, as
the fear of communism became more widespread in the United States.
   The Soviet Union, no longer a U.S. ally, quickly expanded its
influence. Country after country in Eastern Europe fell under the
domination of Soviet-backed Communist parties.
   Churchill warned in 1946, ``From Stettin in the Baltic to
Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the
continent allowing `police government' to rule Eastern Europe.''
The image became a metaphor for the time, and Americans, caught by
surprise by this new Cold War, began to see the world in terms of
``them vs. us,'' ``Ccommunist vs. American.''
   And what could be more ``un-American'' than a former Communist
in the United States, who served as a symbolic link with Soviet
aggression abroad?
   None stood out more than Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss.
   Their drama, played out in the HUAC hearing room and on
Chambers' farm in rural Westminster, Md., came to symbolize the
divisions within the country.
   Hiss, then and even now in his new book ``Recollections of a
Life,'' maintained that he was innocent and victimized by enemies
of the New Deal. Chambers presented himself as the last hope of the
West.
   Their story began in July 1948, when Chambers, a rumply senior
editor at Time magazine, testified to HUAC that Hiss had been a
member of the Communist party in the 1930s.
   Some of the other alleged communists named by Chambers had
admitted their past affiliation, but not the tall and lean Hiss,
who had worked at the State Department and then as president of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Hiss immediately denied
Chambers' charges and asked the committee for a chance to deny them
under oath.
   Hiss made such an impressive appearance that Nixon was the only
committee member to question his denial. Nixon questioned Hiss
secretly in New York and paid several visits to Chambers' farm.
   And at a nine-hour hearing on Aug. 25, 1948, the most dramatic
and crowded event in the committee's history, Nixon and others
pressed Hiss hard for details of his past. Hiss was careful,
prefacing more than 200 answers with ``to be best of my
recollection.''
   Still, there was nothing to show that Hiss had been involved in
any spying. Then, in November 1948, Chambers delivered to the
Justice Department 65 typed pages of copies or summaries of State
Department documents and three memos in Hiss' handwriting. He
stashed two strips of developed microfilm and three cylinders of
undeveloped microfilm in a hollowed-out pumpkin on his Maryland
farm.
   A few days later, with a blast of publicity, HUAC investigators
found the pumpkin and the microfilm, and on Dec. 15, Hiss was
indicted on two counts of perjury. He was convicted in 1950 and
sentenced to five years in prison.
   The Hiss case helped launch Nixon's career. Not long afterward,
Dwight Eisenhower picked the young Republican as his vice president.
   The case also played an unintended role in furthering the
fortunes of Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy, making it easier for
him to exaggerate the dimensions of the internal communist menace.

   HUAC turned its attention in the early 1950s to Hollywood. Its
stated reason was the suspicion that the communists were sneaking
propaganda into the movies. Joseph Rauh Jr., who represented the
writers Arthur Miller and Lillian Hellman in their appearances
before the committee, said in a recent interview that he believes
the committee's real motivation was publicity.
   ``How would you get publicity?'' Rauh asked. ``You'd get it by
getting famous people in front of you. When it was rumored that
Arthur Miller was going to marry Marilyn Monroe, he was subpoenaed
by the committee. He wasn't subpoeaned after he wrote one of the
best plays of this century, `Death of a Salesman.'''
   Ronald Reagan, who served as president of the Screen Actors
Guild, told the committee in 1951, ``I abhor their (communists')
philosophy, but I detest their tactics, which are those of a fifth
column and are dishonest.'' The president's anti-communist rhetoric
has continued, even as he prepares for a trip to Moscow and his
fourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Among others testifying during those years were director Elia
Kazan, writer and performer Abe Burrows, playwright Clifford Odets
and actor Zero Mostel. Many of the Hollywood witnesses exercised
their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves.
   For the committee, taking the Fifth was considered an
acknowledgement that one was a communist. If you had nothing to
hide, panel members reasoned, why take the Fifth.
   Those who did refuse to answer the committee's questions were in
danger of being cited for contempt of Congress.
   Kazan opted to tell all he knew. He not only confessed that he
had been a member of the Communist Party briefly, in 1934-35, but
named others he knew had belonged as well. Odets named names, too.
   Kazan, promoting his new book, ``Elia Kazan: A Life,'' said in a
recent interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, that he debated
whether he should identiy others who had belonged to the Communist
Party.
   ``I went one way and swung the other and it was a very hard
decision to make but I thought ... the Congress has an absolute
right to investigate anything like that, anything like the
Communist Party in this country,'' he said.
   Kazan had directed two of Miller's plays, ``All My Sons'' and
``Death of a Salesman.'' After he testified, he never directed
another work by his longtime friend.
   Hellman in 1952 tried another tack.
   Rauh recalled that Hellman ``said she couldn't name names and
she couldn't go to jail because she was not the kind of person who
could survive in jail.
   ``She said she was perfectly willing to talk about herself. But
the problem was that if she did talk about herself, she waived the
privilege against self-incrimination.''
   Rauh said they worked out an arrangment whereby Hellman would
write a letter to the committee explaining that she would waive the
Fifth Amendment if the committee would not ask her about other
people.
   ``To hurt innocent people whom I knew many years ago in order to
save myself is, to me, inhuman and indecent and dishonorable. I
cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year's
fashions,'' she wrote.
   The committee did not like Hellman's stance, but never pursued
her further.
   The Hollywood investigations marked the end of HUAC's heyday.
The events that followed _ the 1953 death of Josef Stalin, who had
ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist for 24 years; the Senate's
1954 censure of McCarthy, and the end of the Korean War in 1955 _
set in motion the committee's demise.
   HUAC's last stand, in a sense, came in the late 1960s and early
1970s, when it held public hearings on anti-war groups and such
terrorists as the Symbionese Liberation Army.
   Richard Ichord, then a Democratic congressman from Missouri, was
chairman of the committee. He recalled that by the late 1960s, HUAC
``didn't have the support it commanded after World War II. The
Russian bear had become a bugbear.''
   In 1975, less than six months after Nixon was forced out of the
presidency by Watergate, the House reorganized the structure of
various committees.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., introduced the resolution in the
House Democratic Caucus to abolish the committee. ``I'm happy to
say that my motion passed,'' he said. ``I never saw such a fast
hammer in my life.''
   And on Jan. 14, the full House gave its assent. In a final
irony, the House voted to transfer jurisdiction to the civil and
constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee
_ the subcommittee the liberal Edwards headed.
   ``We hold the hearings in the right way _ on civil rights and
civil liberties,'' Edwards said. ``HUAC was a kangaroo court. It
acted as an investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury of men and
women whose political, social and economic views the committee
thought were contemptible.''
   Ichord said he is disappointed that the Judiciary Committee has
not continued to root out communists.
   ``I don't think the Russians have changed their views. ... I
still believe that the Soviet Union is using international
communism in an endeavor to seek world hegemony.''
   So, the debate over HUAC continues, 13 years after its death.
   As the journalist Edward R. Murrow said in his 1954 broadcast
that brought the downfall of McCarthy, ``He didn't create this
situation of fear, he merely exploited it and rather successfully.
Cassius was right. `The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but
in ourselves.'''

<TEXT>
   In his important new book on government
surveillance of prominent authors and artists, Herbert Mitgang
constructs the ludicrous image of G-men tailing playwright Lillian
Hellman while enemy spies gather intelligence on American military
strength and strategy.
   ``J. Edgar Hoover himself took a personal interest in Miss
Hellman's activities,'' Mitgang observes in ``Dangerous Dossiers:
Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors''
(Donald I. Fine, Inc., $18.95).
   ``In a letter written to the FBI special agent in New York in
1943 _ in the middle of World War II, when Nazi agents and the
German-American Bund were operating in the United States _ Hoover
called for a comprehensive report on her.''
   The scene might be laughable, were it not for the questionable
use of manpower, with the nation's very security in jeopardy, that
it suggests.
   ``Dangerous Dossiers'' is first-class journalism as well as
essential documentation on the history and nature of creative
freedom in the United States.
   ``This writer,'' Mitgang notes in the concluding chapter, ``does
not believe that authors are wiser or more talented than any other
creators in this country; nor should they be singled out as
privileged characters. ...
   ``However, there is one major difference that distinguishes the
role played by the press, literature and printing from other
professions. The framers of the Constitution built the First
Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression _ without abridgment
of any kind _ into the democratic structure of the new Republic.''
   ``Dangerous Dossiers'' represents a long and sometimes
frustrating effort by Mitgang, cultural correspondent for The New
York Times, to test the vitality of that guarantee by examining
FBI, CIA and other government files on prominent writers, including
Nobel laureates Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and William
Faulkner, using the Freedom of Information Act.
   Mitgang is the author of four biographies, four novels, and 10
other works of nonfiction, including two books and a play on the
life of Abraham Lincoln.
   He began his inquiry by asking for previously secret government
records on poet and fellow Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg. That
produced an Army intelligence file of six pages and an FBI dossier
containing 23 censored pages.
   ``It wasn't hard,'' he says of the enterprise. ``It was just a
long wait.''
   Most of the material was heavily censored, generally to protect
the government informants, and efforts to obtain the blacked-out
material generally were futile.
   Though some of the targets of government observation might, with
good reason, ridicule the extreme effort (economist-diplomat John
Kenneth Galbraith was thought to be the disciple of an unidentified
subversive called ``Dr. Ware,'' the result of a misunderstanding by
an agent who heard Galbraith's views described as ``doctrinaire'')
many others, Mitgang says, suffered.
   Steinbeck attempted to join the Army during World War II,
Mitgang recalls, ``at the very same time that he was writing
speeches for President Roosevelt and for the head of the Air Force.
   ``He was good enough to do that, but he was not allowed to
become a second lieutenant in the Army because the FBI had
specifically attacked him as something close to a red because of
`The Grapes of Wrath,' which was considered a subversive book.''
   Many of the dozens of novelists and short-story writers, poets
and essayists, playwrights and artists identified in ``Dangerous
Dossiers'' as having secret files never knew they were being
tracked by Hoover's men or other government sleuths. And not one,
Mitgang says, ever was accused of a crime.
   Galbraith, in fact, estimates for the author that the government
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars investigating him.
   ``By a wide margin,'' the former U.S. ambassador to India says,
``it was the most expensively researched enterprise with which I
have ever been associated.''
   And why? Apparently because someone to whom the FBI listened
disagreed with his economic theories. ``Among other things,''
Mitgang writes, ``the Galbraith file noted that `the subject leaned
as far to the left as President Roosevelt.'''
   The disturbing aspect to all of this is that association with a
group the government considered left-of-center or the word of an
unnamed snitch was all that it took to start a file in Washington.
Rarely, if ever, did an agent appear to have read what the subject
of his report had written, Mitgang observes.
   ``These are raw files,'' the author says of his source material.
``They were put in by unnamed informants _ in every case, the names
of informants were blacked out _ without any right of
confrontation, or without any ability to dispute what was said. And
as a result of that, you have accusations by faceless people
without a chance to answer.''
   Today, Mitgang writes, the government will expunge an incorrect
record, but not for a subject no longer living. ``The lesson is
clear,'' he writes. ``Don't die if you want to reclaim your good
name and reputation.''
   Despite the tightening of rules against spying on ordinary
citizens, Mitgang says government surveillance continues.
   ``Three thousand pages were obtained very recently by the Center
for Constitutional Rights . . . and what they found out was that
anyone who went to Central America, who signed a petition against
the Contras . . . any of these people found themselves in files,''
Mitgang says.
   ``And the targets in recent months that emerged were such
organizations as the Maryknoll sisters, the United Auto Workers,
the National Council of Churches and I'm sure anyone who took a
visa to go to Central America.''

   Singer Kym Ryder sipped on her tea and squirmed
in her seat. She was discussing her childhood, her days on the
road, her debut record. But she would rather have been in front of
an audience.
   ``My idea of a good time is performing,'' said Ryder. ``The
closer I am to the people, the better. I want to sit on their
table.''
   Ryder, whose new LP is ``Angel Arrive,'' does not need a stage
to attract attention. She stands 5 feet 9 under a wave of blond
hair. She is outgoing and curious about the people around her. She
likes to talk. She has a lot to say.
   She knew from an early age she did not want to spend her entire
life in Minneapolis, where she was born in 1965 and adopted by a
UPS employee and his wife. Her first live performance was a
rendition of ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' sung in front of a
collection of aunts and uncles. She was 4 years old.
   In junior high school, she got involved in acting. In high
school she joined her first band and was impatient to pursue a
career in music.
   ``I was kind of a rebel in high school,'' she said. ``I thought
it was a stupid setup. School was just holding me down. It was a
very frustrating time.''
   A week after graduating, she hit the road. ``I followed bikers
and things like that. I got down and dirty for a while,'' she said.
   Three years on the road, frequently changing bands, living out
of a trunk and suitcase did little to discourage Ryder.
   ``You learn whether you want to do this for the rest of your
life. You like it or you don't. It cuts the men from the boys,''
she said, laughing. ``I loved it, even when I was broke and
starving.''
   Two years ago, performing in Wyoming, she caught the attention
of a vacationing New York lawyer.
   ``He saw me play and liked the energy,'' Ryder said. ``He
followed me 100 miles and saw me the next day. He left roses in my
hotel room; I didn't see the roaches anymore.''
   The lawyer left a business card and suggested Ryder look him up
if she came to New York. Ryder came East and met David Werner, who
produced the record and wrote the songs. ``Shatter the Glass'' is
the first single.
   ``Everything is so perfect, then something happens and shatters
the reality,'' she said. ``I'm like the devil, the temptress. I
pull you in. I shatter the fantasy.''
   The music on ``Angel Arrive'' is straight ahead pop-rock.
Ryder's singing shows the influence of the music's best known
female vocalists.
   ``I loved Pat Benatar. I looked like her in high school,'' she
said. ``Singers like Debbie Harry and Belinda Carlisle, that's who
I sound like. I have a pure voice, very strong.''
   Rock 'n' roll has always appealed to nonconformists, and Ryder
is no exception. ``I was always the black sheep; I always liked to
dress weird,'' she said. ``People think I'm so outrageous. My
friends were just paralyzed by me.''
   Ryder sees live performing as a way of breaking down barriers
between herself and the audience. She describes herself as a tomboy
growing up and admits to feeling more comfortable around men. On
stage, she has had trouble, almost to the point of violence, with
women who feel threatened by her presence on stage.
   ``Sure I flirt on stage, but I try to make it for fun. I don't
do that dripping kind of sex thing,'' she said.
   But occasionally, she can connect. One time was in Salt Lake
City.
   ``After one of my ballads, a girl took off one of her earrings
and handed it to me,'' she remembered. ``It's still in my jewelry
box. Things like that nail me.''
   Although Ryder must face the problems of being a woman in the
music industry, she considers herself relatively fortunate.
   ``It (sexism) is around all the time, but I haven't had to deal
with it in a bad way,'' she said. ``I've found very good people and
stuck with them.''
   If she's had any disappointments, it's been with the pace of her
career.
   ``I don't like having to wait. I don't like depending on other
people. I'm after the next thing.''
   But even if Ryder has been frustrated by the lengthy process of
getting her first album released, she has lost none of her
determination to succeed.
   ``I never want to wake up and say, `I wish I would have.' You
just go for it.''

   A record level of export sales gave the United
States its lowest monthly trade deficit in three years during
March, the government has reported.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the deficit shrank
dramatically in March to $9.7 billion, a drop of 29.5 percent from
the February imbalance of $13.8 billion.
   The improvement came from a 23 percent surge in American
exports, which rose to a record monthly high of $29 billion, as
demand for U.S. machinery, aircraft, computers and chemicals picked
up sharply. This offset a smaller rise in imports, which climbed
3.6 percent to $38.7 billion.

   The Associated Press reported Monday that the
Supreme Court let stand a ruling that Continental Bank
International, based in Chicago, must pay more than $6 million in
taxes, penalties and interest to New York City.
   The report may have left the impression that the bank still owes
the money. The bank said it had paid the money under protest before
the appeal was decided.

   Big computer buyers say they hope the battle for
control of AT&T's Unix operating system does not fragment the
important computing standard.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. faced a rebellion Tuesday by
seven major computer companies that want to establish a version of
the Unix software that would not be under AT&T's control.
   The companies invited AT&T to join their new Open Software
Foundation, but AT&T questioned the group's motives and vowed to
continue its separate efforts to create a unified computing
standard.
   Computer buyers are pressing strongly for a single computing
standard that would make it possible for them to move their
programs easily from one make of computer to another.
   ``There is a need for some standardization and continuity in
this whole process, and somebody needs to play that (oversight)
role,'' Larry Bacon, senior vice president of data processing for
Travelers Corp. in Hartford, Conn., said in an interview Tuesday.
   Unix is a layer of software known as an operating system that
controls the basic operations of a computer and lies invisibly
beneath the programs that people use.
   AT&T invented Unix but customers of other companies have
demanded it, partly because it makes it easier for computers of
different makes to run the same programs.
   The four American and three European computer companies want to
use a version of Unix as the core of a standardized ``environment''
that will go beyond just the operating system to include the whole
scope of computing. They said Tuesday they will spend $90 million
over the next three years.
   ``We are certainly most enthusiastic about anything that can be
done to standardize onto a single operating system,'' said Bruce
Rosenblatt, manager of information systems planning for Chevron
Corp. in San Francisco. He expressed cautious support for the new
foundation.
   Robert Kavner, the new president of AT&T's Data Systems Group,
charged in an interview that some members of the Open Software
Foundation are not truly interested in openness.
   The new group includes the world's two biggest computer
companies, International Business Machines Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp., as well as Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo Computer
Inc., West Germany's Siemens AG and Nixdorf Computer AG, and
France's Groupe Bull.
   Top executives of all seven companies shared the stage at a New
York auditorium Tuesday in a rare show of force.
   ``Will our companies continue to compete with each other? Of
course we will,'' IBM Chairman John F. Akers said. ``This is quite
an eventful day, and I believe a good one.''
   The seven companies threw AT&T on the defensive, said Marc
Schulman, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. On the other hand,
critics of the Open Software Foundation say its members have
reasons for their actions beyond those publicly stated.
   IBM and Digital both are strongly committed to their own
operating systems, which compete with Unix. Keeping customers
locked into their own operating systems gives them some shelter
from competition.
   ``Investors and other people have a right to kind of look at
today's events with a slightly jaundiced eye,'' said John Rutledge,
an analyst for Dillon, Read & Co.
   But Salomon's Schulman said Hewlett-Packard, which is strongly
committed to Unix, is the driving force behind the foundation and
would not have aligned itself with IBM and Digital if it feared
those companies would drag their feet. The Open Software Foundation
said it will build its new operating system off the base of IBM's
version of Unix, known as AIX. The software ``environment'' will
comply with a variety of national and international standards.
   Other companies are being invited to join the foundation for
$25,000 a year and non-profit groups for $5,000 a year. Members
will contribute staff.

<HEAD>U.S. Steelmakers Want Trade Barriers Maintained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosperity that import quotas helped bring
to American steel companies is undermining the fledgling campaign
to maintain the trade barriers, according to industry officials.
   Quotas, or voluntary restraint agreements, negotiated by the
Reagan administration with 31 countries are due to expire in
September 1989.
   ``I say in semi-jest, what the industry needs if it really wants
the VRAs is a noticeable but not disastrous recession,'' said one
government steel specialist who spoke on condition he not be
identified. ``The industry is going to have to do one hell of a job
of lobbying.''
   Extending the quota program is high on the agenda at the
American Iron and Steel Institute's annual conference, which began
in earnest today in Washington.
   ``It's a fragile recovery,'' AISI President Milton Deaner said
of the industry's health. ``I see troubling signs among some
government officials of a lessened sense of urgency about the need
to cope with imports and the trade deficit in general.''
   Importers argue that extended quotas will hurt the economy with
higher prices and steel shortages. Domestic opposition also is
forming in steel-consuming states enduring rising prices and tight
supplies.
   ``You've got a lot of people out there screeching and hollering
in Maine and Iowa and Nebraska about their inability to get
steel,'' said the steel specialist. ``Those people are going to be
standing right up there come the debate on the extension of the
VRAs.''
   Some mills are operating virtually flat out and are turning away
orders. Prices, which dropped 15 percent after 1981, rose 4 percent
to 5 pecent last year and could do the same this year, analysts say.
   The AISI estimates industry profits of $1 billion for 1987,
after $12 billion in losses from 1982 to 1986.
   The Reagan administration's quota program, enhanced by currency
exchange rates that make imported goods more expensive, helped
sustain financially weak U.S. steelmakers while they wrote off
unprofitable plants and modernized the remainder.
   With employment down from about 390,000 in 1981 to a record low
of about 163,000 for 1987, American steelmakers claim to be the
most efficient in the world.
   ``For the first time in 30 years, we have lower costs of
producing steel for our customers in the U.S. than the Japanese
industry has in providing steel to their customers in Japan,'' said
David Roderick, chairman of USX Corp., the nation's largest
steelmaker.
   After a slow start in 1985 and 1986, the quota program contained
foreign steel to 21 percent of the U.S. market last year, near its
goal of 18.5 percent.
   ``In this way, the president's program has been more successful
than any import program attempted by government in the last 20
years,'' said Thomas Graham, AISI chairman and head of steel
operations at USX.
   ``The principle of voluntary restraint has been established,''
he said. ``What is needed now is to bring more countries into the
VRA.''
   Bringing Canada, which now ships steel freely to the United
States, into the quota plan will present a ticklish problem for the
AISI, whose members include Canada's largest mills.
   Industry watchers say Japan seems to favor the orderliness of
the quotas as long as its aggressive Pacific neighbors are
included, and European steelmakers may prefer extended quotas to
the lawsuits they could face over allegedly unfair trade practices.
   Domestic producers likely will want restrictions eased on
foreign made semi-finished steel needed to supply America's roaring
mills, the government steel specialist said.
   Lobbying for and against an extension has begun, although ``I
don't think it's in full swing,'' said Jack Andresen, director of
the 94-member, bipartisan House Steel Caucus. ``This fall or next
year you'll see a full-blown lobbying effort by both groups.''

   The United States imported 1.8 million net
tons of steel in March, including about 224,000 net tons of
semi-finished steel for domestic steelmakers, according to the
American Institute for Imported Steel Inc.
   The New York-based trade group said the imports represented 17.2
percent of domestic consumption, well below the Reagan
administration's goal of 18.5 percent.
   AIIS President Erwin L. Klein said Tuesday that semi-finished
imports have been in demand by U.S. rolling mills since early 1988,
Klein said. Semi-finished imports reached 12 percent of total steel
import tonnage in March, he said.
   The institute represents 70 leading steel importers that handle
about 70 percent of imported tonnage.

<HEAD>American Stores Ups Bid For Lucky Stores To $65 A Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bidding war for Lucky Stores Inc. has
continued with a new $2.5 billion takeover offer by American Stores
Co., which is trying to beat out an investment firm for ownership
of the nation's sixth largest supermarket chain.
   American Stores on Tuesday increased its tender offer to $65 a
share to counter a $61 per share, or $2.2 billion, leveraged buyout
plan that Lucky accepted last month from New York-based Gibbons,
Green, Van Amerongen Ltd.
   The new offer had been expected following Lucky Stores'
disclosure of confidential information to American, made with the
stipulation that American either boost its price or end the hostile
takeover bid.
   If accepted, the combined stores would become one of the biggest
supermarket companies in the nation. American, which owns the Alpha
Beta grocery chain, is based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
   Shares of Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., closed down 25 cents
at $61.12{ on the New York Stock Exchange. American Stores stock
fell 75 cents to $57.
   American, which initiated the bidding in March at $45 a share
and later indicated it would offer at least $60 a share, extended
its tender offer's expiration from Tuesday to June 1.
   Lucky Stores spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said the company's board
of Directors and independent financial and legal advisors would
review the offer and respond shortly. No date or time for the
meeting was set, she said.
   American chairman L.S. Skaggs, in a letter to Lucky's directors,
wrote that the sweetened offer was based on the confidential
information from Lucky ``and the very favorable impression we
received in the course of meetings with your management last
Friday.''
   Skaggs said in his letter that in connection with the proposal,
American Stores was prepared to enter into an agreement and plan of
merger substantially similar to merger plan executed by Gibbons,
Green, van Amerongen.
   He said American also was prepared to enter into incentive
compensation arrangements with selected key personnel.
   Skaggs said it would be in the companies' mutual interest to
enter the merger agreement by the close of business on Friday.
   ``As we have indicated in the past, we believe that substantial
business advantages would accrue from the combination of Lucky's
operations with those of Alpha Beta and we view Lucky's management
as a vital ingredient to the combination of the two companies,''
Skaggs wrote.
   Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York has committed $500
million in financing for the transaction, said Skaggs.

<TEXT>
   A 4-day-old strike by the United Rubber
Workers union against Firestone Inc. moves back to center stage
following a tentative agreement that averted a walkout at 11
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. plants.
   Union and Goodyear negotiators reached an amended contract
settlement shortly before a noon strike deadline on Tuesday,
forestalling a strike by 15,000 Goodyear workers.
   Some 4,700 Firestone workers in six states went on strike Sunday
after union negotiators decided Firestone's offer didn't match an
earlier agreement with Goodyear, which the union intended to serve
as a pattern for Firestone.
   URW International President Milan Stone said the union would
notify Firestone of the changes made Tuesday in Goodyear's new
contract proposal.
   ``They (Firestone) weren't willing to follow the pattern as it
was on Saturday night at midnight. So I don't know what their
response will be now,'' Stone said. ``We have not heard from
Firestone since the strike began.''
   Firestone officials said Saturday the company believed its offer
was equal to Goodyear's. Firestone spokesman Bob Troyer said
Tuesday the company would review the revised Goodyear contract.
   ``For the past two days, the union's attention has been focused
on Goodyear,'' Troyer said. ``Now that they have reached a
tentative agreement, we hope they will get back with us and we can
begin negotiating again.''
   The URW represents workers at Firestone plants in Noblesville,
Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville, Ark., and
Oklahoma City as well as maintenance workers and technicians in
Akron.
   Goodyear workers are to hold a ratification vote before a new
strike deadline of May 24.
   Stone said three key changes were made in the three-year
agreement reached April 21 by the company and the union. A majority
of the membership at the 11 Goodyear locals rejected the proposed
pact on May 2.
   Added to the agreement was a 25 cents-per-hour wage increase;
however, cost-of-living increases will be reduced by 25 cents in
three steps.
   The amended contract restores a requirement that all locals
approve any wage concessions accepted by any single local, Stone
said. It also provides for a wage reopener in March 1990 that
hinges on the company's recovery from the financial impact of an
attempted takeover in 1986.
   Akron-based Goodyear ended the takeover attempt by financier Sir
James Goldsmith when it bought Goldsmith's 11.5 percent share of
the company for $619 million.
   Eleven of Goodyear's 42 plants nationwide would have been shut
down by a strike. The plants are in Akron, Marysville and St.
Marys, Ohio; Lincoln, Neb.; New Bedford, Mass.; Sun Prairie, Wis.;
Topeka, Kan.; Union City, Tenn.; Danville, Va.; Madisonville, Ky.;
and Gadsden, Ala.
   J.W. Battles, president of Local 12 in Gadsden, Ala., said he
would recommend the new package to his 3,000 members, who rejected
the first proposal.
   ``It's an improvement to what we had,'' he said. ``At least,
it's money up front.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms Order to Revise Auto Fuel Ratings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also ran on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's two largest automakers could face
$300 million in penalties because of ruling by a sharply divided
federal appeals court that upholds revised fuel economy ratings for
1980-1984 model cars.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington split 5-5 along
ideological lines Tuesday, leaving intact a 1986 order by a
three-judge panel of the court. The earlier order followed a
challenge of new Environmental Protection Agency standards by the
Center for Auto Safety, a consumer activist group.
   At issue is EPA's decision in 1985 to raise the fuel economy
ratings for cars made between 1980 and 1984 to reflect seven
changes in test procedures. Ford and GM contended the original
method had unfairly lowered the ratings.
   The higher ratings recalculated by EPA lowered penalties against
Ford and GM for falling short of the fuel-economy standards set
under the Environmental Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.
   Under the law, manufacturers are penalized $5 for each tenth of
a mile a model falls short of the miles-per-gallon standard. The
law also gives manufacturers credits for surpassing the standards
that can be carried over into subsequent model years.
   The three-judge panel had unanimously held that in recalculating
the ratings, EPA should also have factored in changes in several
test procedures that had benefited manufacturers by raising the
scores.
   The full court later vacated the panel's ruling and agreed to
rehear the case.
   The automobile manufacturers have never provided an estimate of
how much the 1986 ruling would cost them. But the Center for Auto
Safety estimates it could result in penalties up to $300 million
for Ford and GM. Chrysler Corp. was not affected because its cars
met the fuel-economy standards for those years.
   GM spokesman Bill Nowack said in a statement that ``the decision
is symptomatic of the burdensome problems CAFE (the fuel economy
system) has represented in recent years _ which have threatened
American productivity and jobs.'' But he added that ``the potential
impact of the court decision and the expected EPA rulemaking are
yet to be fully determined.''
   The judges split along liberal and conservative lines over
whether the center had legal standing to challenge the way the EPA
recalculated the Corporate Average Fuel Economy ratings.
   Chief Judge Patricia Wald, who wrote the original 1986 opinion,
tartly accused her conservative colleagues of ignoring legal
precedent, the will of Congress and common sense in questioning the
center's right to bring the case.
   Conservatives argued that the consumer group lacked legal
standing because it could not prove that EPA's decision inflicted
an economic harm.
   ``The fact that Congress has determined that consumers would be
injured by driving automobiles that use more rather than less fuel
is of little help in determining whether these petitioners are able
to establish ... injuries-in-fact sufficiently personal and
concrete to meet the requirements'' for legal standing, Judge James
L. Buckley wrote in a dissent. He was joined by Judges Douglas H.
Ginsburg, Stephen Williams and Kenneth Starr.
   Wald, joined by Judges Abner Mikva, Spottswood Robinson, Ruth B.
Ginsburg and Harry Edwards, said the consumers have standing
because ``the injury they suffer is a traditional economic one:
higher prices and diminished availability of the goods they seek.''

   The House is sending a warning to federal
managers and private contractors doing government work: say no to
drugs in the workplace or risk losing the money arriving from the
Treasury.
   In what could be the first of a series of votes in the coming
weeks, the House on Tuesday approved an amendment that would cut
off the flow of public funds to federal and private-sector
workplaces with illegal drug problems.
   The amendment was tacked onto the first fiscal 1989
appropriations bill to reach the House floor _ a $17.8 billion
package to finance the Department of Energy and water development
projects by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Interior
Department's Bureau of Reclamation.
   The spending bill was sent to the Senate by a 384-20 roll call
shortly after the House voted 273-127 for the anti-drug amendment
offered by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa.
   Walker said the ban would apply to federal offices covered by
the spending bill and private-sector companies holding government
contracts for such activities as research and construction.
   ``There is nothing in this amendment that says you have to go to
drug testing,'' said Walker, adding that he hopes to add the
provision to the 12 other fiscal 1989 appropriations bills heading
toward the House floor.
   He said the major effect of the amendment would be to encourage
private employers doing business with the federal government to
adopt and enforce policies against drugs in their workplaces.
   Walker said that with such a policy in place, an employer could
probably avoid losing contract payments by convincing officials
that an instance of on-the-job drug abuse was an aberration, not a
regular occurrence.
   The Pennsylvania lawmaker recently succeeded in convincing
colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee to add the
anti-drug language to authorization bills for four agencies,
including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
National Science Foundation.
   Tuesday's vote was the first by the full House on the proposal.
   Walker said he hopes to improve the language of the amendment to
include provisions to establish procedures for cutting off money
because of workplace problems with drugs.
   The amendment drew only brief debate before it was added to
legislation to finance energy and water development projects for
the year beginning Oct. 1.
   The bill's floor manager, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., said the
package was $357 million below the Reagan administration's request
and was consistent with deficit-reduction agreement reached last
year by the White House and congressional leaders.
   The bill contains money to continue work on hundreds of dams,
harbors and irrigation systems but, according to Bevill, none to
begin any new projects because of the budget deficit. Aides to
Bevill say they can't recall the last time an appropriations bill
came to the floor without new projects.
   The Office of Management and Budget disagrees with the
no-new-starts description. Spokeswoman Barbara Clay said the bill
contains eight new starts, although she notes OMB and Congress
disagree over what constitutes the start of construction.
   Under any definition of a ``new start,'' the legislation is
modest, compared with past years when the annual ``pork-barrel''
spending bill contained 20 or more construction starts.
   Clay said that while the administration is ``not displeased''
with the bill's price tag, it was unhappy because it bars the start
of construction for the Super Collider, the huge physics project
for research into basic matter.
   Bevill said the prohibition was placed into the bill because
lawmakers want the next administration to decide whether to proceed
with a major undertaking that could cost from $4.4 billion to $9
billion.

<HEAD>Media General Says It Rejected Sugarman Offer to End Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc.'s board of directors has
rejected an offer by California investor Burt Sugarman to end his
takeover bid in exchange for a large share of the company's cable
television operation in northern Virginia, Media General officials
say.
   The company's board turned down the offer as ``greenmail of the
most egregious sort,'' President James S. Evans said Tuesday night.
Greenmail occurs when a company gets a potential acquirer to end
the chase by agreeing to buy back its own shares at a premium not
available to other stockholders.
   Jeffrey Taufield, a spokesman for Sugarman, would not confirm
the terms of the purported offer or even that an offer was made on
Sugarman's behalf.
   Taufield quoted Sugarman as describing Media General's version
as a ``last-minute desperation move to turn around a proxy
contest'' that he contended Media General is losing. ``It just
won't work.''
   J. Stewart Bryan III, vice chairman of Media General, said the
offer was made Monday afternoon by Sugarman's financial advisers to
Media General's financial advisers.
   Sugarman proposed withdrawing his nominees for three of the nine
seats on the company's board in balloting that ends Friday and
exchanging his group's 10.1 percent share of Media General publicly
traded stock for about 43 percent of a new company that would own
the cable system in Fairfax County, company officials said.
   Media General is seeking the re-election of its three directors,
and the family of Chairman D. Tennant Bryan opposes the sale of the
Richmond-based communications company at any price. Sugarman,
chairman of two companies that produce cement and television game
shows, has offered $1.8 billion for Media General, or $70 a share.
   Sugarman was seeking to buy the cable system ``at a bargain
basement price,'' Evans said. Sugarman's investment adviser valued
the system at $300 million, while the company values it at $450
million to $600 million, according to Stewart Bryan.
   That prompted the charge of greenmail.
   Sugarman couldn't be reached for comment, but Taufield said
Sugarman ``said he never made Media General an offer.''
   Taufield declined comment on whether Sugarman's financial
advisers at Bear Stearns & Co. forwarded a proposal for spinning
off the cable system and letting Sugarman obtain a 43 percent stake
in it.
   Legal and investment banking advisers for both Sugarman's group
and Media General ``have been communicating throughout the
process,'' Taufield said.
   He said Sugarman reiterated his pledge not to accept greenmail
and that a proposal to pay shareholders $70 per share in a $1.8
billion transaction remains on the table.
   Bear Stearns executives went to the offices of Goldman Sachs &
Co, Media General's financial adviser, in New York Monday afternoon
and made the offer. ``I don't think it was in writing,'' Stewart
Bryan said.
   Asked what the company's next move would be, he said, ``I don't
know what to expect from people of his type. There is no next move,
as far as I'm concerned.''

<HEAD>Court Says Consumer Laws No Protection for Those Who Lease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and federal consumer protection
laws don't cover leased vehicles, a Florida appeal court ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st District Court of Appeal
concluded in a unanimous opinion Tuesday that Florida's Uniform
Commercial Code and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act should
cover leased cars, but they don't.
   ``Obviously, in today's market place, a compelling case can be
made for applying the principles of the Magnuson-Moss Act to
transactions of the type before us, but that remains a matter for
legislative decision,'' the judges wrote.
   Both laws permit purchasers to return vehicles and other new
items that have numerous defects not satisfactorily repaired by
dealers and manufacturers.
   The judges said it was the first time a Florida appellate court
had ruled on the issue.
   The opinion upheld a decision by Circuit Judge A.C. Soud Jr.,
who ordered a directed verdict in favor of Frank Griffin AMC Jeep
Inc. of Jacksonville and American Credit Corp. in a suit filed by
Timothy L. Sellers and Kristi H. Sellers over a defective lease
vehicle.
   The dealer had refused to take back the Sellers' new Jeep
Cherokee or refund their down payment and lease payments after the
car allegedly developed numerous problems, including an engine that
exploded, rattles and leaks, seat covers that separated, brakes
that failed and an air conditioning system that didn't cool.
   Soud and the appeal judges found neither state nor federal law
covered the couple because the statutes apply only to sales
transactions.
   The Sellers would have wound up paying about the same as if they
had purchased the vehicle, because they would have had to carry
insurance and have the car serviced and repaired.
   ``The legal incidents of a lease vary significantly from those
of a sale, and the parties' unambiguous expression of intent to
create only a lease cannot be overturned by this court through
legal recharacterization of the transaction,'' the judges wrote.
   ``Transactions like this one obviously should be made subject to
UCC provisions for revocation of the acceptance when a defective
vehicle is delivered pursuant to either a sale or a long term
lease,'' the judges stated. ``Nevertheless we must leave this
solution to the Legislature.''

   Share prices were lower at midday Wednesday as a
gloomy mood settled into the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 12.3
points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,776.9 at 12:30 p.m. local time.
   Volume was 255.3 million shares at midday compared with 203.5
million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   The inability of Wall Street to set an upbeat tone after
Tuesday's narrower-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for March
prompted a markdown in prices, dealers said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed more than 20 points
lower Tuesday as traders focused on the bearish side of the $9.7
billion trade shortfall, saying a rise in imports coupled with an
expanding export sector meant inflation was on the horizon.
   The deficit compared with a shortfall of $13.8 billion in
February.
   ``We couldn't muster any enthusiasm after Wall Street didn't
perform too well'' on Tuesday, one equity salesman said.

   Shareholders of Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.
have voted to change the company's name to Baxter International
Inc., effective Wednesday.
   The vote at the annual shareholders meeting Tuesday was part of
a continuing campaign to project a more unified image of the
company and its products, Baxter said in a statement.
   ``The proposal to change the name of our company is much more
than cosmetic,'' Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman and chief
executive, told shareholders. ``It represents the very core of our
strategy.''
   Baxter acquired American Hospital Supply Corp. in 1985, and
Loucks said company officials ``worked aggressively over the past
two years to unite what was Baxter Travenol with what was American
Hospital Supply Corp.''
   ``That job is not yet finished,'' he said. ``But it is on
schedule. And I can report to you today that we are now one company
working effectively for leadership in health care around the
world.''
   Baxter, based in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, is a leading
international producer of health-care products, systems and
services. It had 1987 revenue of $6.2 billion.

   Harvard University's clerical and
technical workers narrowly approved a bid to unionize, but the
fight that set an Ivy League faculty against an administration
accused of strong-arm tactics may not be over.
   Tuesday's vote, which the president of the parent union called
an important step in organizing white-collar workers, ended with
the union winning by 44 votes.
   The unofficial count Tuesday night was 1,530 to 1,486, but 41
ballots were challenged, said Allison Chisolm, a university
spokeswoman. The university has asked the National Labor Relations
Board to investigate the conduct of the union in the election.
   ``We're all ecstatic,'' said Kristine Rondeau, the union's chief
organizer and a former Harvard employee. ``We want to make this a
model for women everywhere.''
   Harvard's 3,300 clerical and technical workers have always
bargained on their own, a practice organizers say has resulted in
lower pay for women, who comprise 83 percent of the group.
   Rondeau maintained the union was victorious, saying, ``Whenever
you have a big and powerful and sophisticated employee like this
one, you always have a close vote.''
   The prestige of Harvard and the publicity generated by the union
effort increased the importance of Tuesday's voting. Gerald
McEntee, president of the 1.1 million-member American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, called it ``the premier test
of our union in 1988.''
   AFSCME would be the parent union of the Harvard Union of
Clerical and Technical Workers.
   ``As goes Harvard,'' McEntee said, ``so goes the unorganized
white-collar sector of the economy.''
   The struggle to unionize, reminiscent of a 1985 campaign that
led to a bitter strike by clerical and technical workers at
Harvard's Ivy League rival, Yale University, went on for more than
a year and became increasingly public as union representatives
accused the university of strong-arm, anti-union tactics.
   The university argued that the union offered workers no
substantive promises.
   ``I don't think we're anti-union,'' said Anne Taylor, who
directed Harvard's response to the organizational effort. ``We have
run an extremely fair, fact-based campaign.''
   Last month, 27 faculty members signed a full-page advertisement
published in the campus newspaper calling on the administration to
stop interfering in the union campaign.
   Last Sunday, 350 faculty members, religious leaders, actors,
elected officials and civil rights activists signed an
advertisement supporting the union under the headline, ``We're with
you.''
   Taylor said the outcome of the election could be affected by an
investigation into reports that the union may have engaged in
conduct prohibited by the national labor law.
   ``Until the NLRB has certified the results, they are not
final,'' she said. ``In the event the NLRB declares the union the
winner, Harvard will work constructively with the union in the
interest of support staff and the university.''
   Henry Griggs, spokesman for AFSCME, said Harvard's clerical
workers ``have waited a long time for this. But they'll have a
fight on their hands. They'll have to negotiate a contract but at
least this time they'll have a voice.''
   University President Derek Bok told the workers in a letter that
he believes in the union movement but feels it is inappropriate for
their type of work.
   ``Unions have typically resisted efforts to reward superior
achievement with greater compensation or to allow supervisors and
employees to vary the way they work in response to their special
needs and capabilities,'' Bok wrote.
   A clerical union would cover 110 job descriptions, Rondeau said,
including librarians, secretaries, biomedical assistants and copy
center operators. She said typical annual salaries for clerical
workers at Harvard are around $18,000.

<HEAD>Record Export Sales Slashed U.S. Trade Deficit in March</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS new grafs 1-5 to UPDATE with housing starts for April,
edit to conform; picks up 2nd graf pvs bg'ng, While the ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction edged up 0.5 percent in April, the third
monthly gain in a row after a sharp slump at the end of last year,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase pushed construction
activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units.
   The increase last month followed a gain of 2.3 percent in March
and 9.9 percent in February. But housing activity was still 4.5
percent below last year, in part because of declines in December
and January.
   Many economists now believe rising mortgage interest rates could
choke off housing growth later this year.
   The government's report Tuesday that the March trade deficit
fell to the lowest level in three years helped the dollar but
failed to inspire other financial markets.
   While the dollar climbed against most other currencies after
Tuesday's report, stock and bond prices sagged.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 21.22 points
to 1,986.41, erasing its 17.08-point gain on Monday. Broader stock
market indices also fell. In the credit markets, yields on the
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose to 9.21 percent from 9.11
percent late Monday.
   The Commerce Department said a record level of exports helped
reduce the trade deficit to $9.7 billion in March compared with the
February imbalance of $13.8 billion.
   American exports rose 23 percent to an all-time high of $29
billion in March, as demand for U.S. machinery, aircraft, computers
and chemicals picked up sharply. That offset a 3.6 percent increase
in imports, which rose to $38.7 billion.
   For the first quarter of 1988, the trade deficit totaled $36
billion, an annual pace of $144 billion. Last year, the merchandise
trade deficit hit a record $171.2 billion, but as expected to
decline by about $20 billion this year.
   Analysts said some investors are worried the export boom will
spark another round of inflation in the United States as factories,
many already operating at peak capacity, begin to raise prices.
   The Federal Reserve Board said in a separate economic report
Tuesday that American industry operated at an eight-year high of
82.7 percent of capacity in April, a 0.3 percentage point rise from
March.
   The high operating rate was solid evidence of the boom in export
sales, economists said, but they cautioned that the country wais
approaching a danger zone in which tight labor markets begin
pushing prices higher. Unemployment fell to a 14-year low of 5.4
percent last month.
   ``You would have to read the trade number as evidence supporting
the view that wages and prices will be firming up and there will be
further inflationary pressures later this year,'' said Jerry
Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   That view was echoed in a survey indicating the nation's
purchasing managers have become more optimistic the economy will
continue growing this year, but also expect higher inflation.
   In their latest semiannual forecast, 73 percent of the
purchasing managers predicted the economy would be better in 1988
than it was in 1987, compared with 57 percent in their December
report.
   They forecast a net average increase in prices of about 5.8
percent for the year, the report said, compared with their December
forecast of a 3.6 percent price rise for all of 1988.
   The latest survey was released by the National Association of
Purchasing Management, an education and research organization.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sharp decline in the U.S. trade
deficit in March was welcomed Wednesday by Taiwan, which has been
under pressure from U.S. officials to reduce its huge trade surplus.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Taiwan's trade surplus
with the United States was $531.8 million in March, down from $1.34
billion the month before.
   ``That's really exciting news,'' said Lin Chien-shan, economics
professor at Fu Jen University.
   Lin said the narrowing trade imbalance would help alleviate U.S.
pressure on Taiwan to appreciate its currency against the U.S.
dollar. A stronger Taiwan dollar makes the island's products less
competitive in the American market and helps U.S. goods sell in
Taiwan.
   The U.S. dollar gained slightly against the Taiwan dollar in the
foreign exchange market Wednesday. The Taiwan dollar traded at
28.62 per U.S. dollar, compared with the 28.61 rate maintained for
the past 14 days.
   The Taiwan dollar has appreciated 39 percent since January 1986,
largely under U.S. pressure.

<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Bell & Howell Co. have
voted to approve a $702 million buyout led by Texas financier
Robert M. Bass and members of Bell & Howell's management.
   The approval cleared the way for the information services
company to become a subsidiary of Bell & Howell Group Inc., which
was formed by an affiliate of Robert M. Bass Group Inc., Acadia
Partners L.P. of Fort Worth, Texas, and certain Bell & Howell
executives.
   The executives include Gerald E. Schultz, Bell & Howell's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Under the buyout, shareholders will receive $64 a share for
their common and preferred stock, Bell & Howell said in a statement
Tuesday.
   Financing arrangements for the deal were consummated shortly
after the shareholder approval, the company said.
   The financing includes $200 in senior subordinated debt, of
which Acadia Partners is buying $30 million; $344 million in bank
financing; $100 million equity participation in the form of cash
and Bell & Howell stock; and $58 million of Bell & Howell's cash on
hand.
   Schultz said Bell & Howell would concentrate on its core
international businesses of mail handling systems, microfilm
products and services, textbook publishing and private database
publishing.
   ``Bell & Howell's new investors and existing management are
committed to moving forward and providing unique and challenging
opportunities for its employees and customers,'' he said.
   Bell & Howell is based in Skokie, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.

<TEXT>
   Lear Petroleum Corp. and BP America Inc. have
agreed to settle a class-action suit brought by Lear's
preferred-stock holders who opposed the redemption terms of BP's
tender offer for the Dallas-based energy company.
   Under terms of the settlement offer, if BP America's proposed
$260 million acquisition of Lear is completed by June 3, BP America
will pay each holder of Lear preferred stock $2.50 at the time Lear
redeems the preferred stock for $6 per share.
   The settlement is subject to approval of the Delaware Chancery
Court and a two-thirds vote by preferred holders to permit Lear to
redeem the preferred stock at $6 per share.
   The proposal came Tuesday after Lear requested that the New York
Stock Exchange delay the opening of trading in its $2.875 preferred
stock pending an announcement on the settlement of a lawsuit the
stockholders filed in Delaware.
   Before the announcement of the settlement offer, a group lead by
J.B. Rubin & Co. of Rowayton, Conn., said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends to oppose the
redemption of Lear's preferred stock in connection with the
proposed merger.
   The group, which holds 227,900 Lear preferred shares, or about
10.39 percent of Lear's outstanding preferred stock, said it may
solicit proxies in opposition to the redemption of the preferred
stock.
   Chuck Webster, a spokesman for BP America in Cleveland, said the
company will not further increase the consideration to be paid to
preferred-stock holders.
   The proposed acquisition would give BP, the world's
third-largest oil company, its own natural gas transmission system
in the United States. BP America is the U.S. affiliate of British
Petroleum Co. PLC.

   Stocks opened lower today after a sharp drop in

<HEAD>UP Chairman Walsh Says Federal Rail Worker Law Fundamentally Wrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law governing injured railroad
employees cost American railroads $600 million in one year, yet
does not benefit workers fairly and should be changed or dropped,
Union Pacific Railroad Chairman Michael H. Walsh said.
   In a speech prepared for Tuesday delivery to medical directors
of the American Association of Railroads in Las Vgas, Walsh said
the law is archaic and causes suffering both for injured workers
and railroads.
   ``Only the lawyers are sure winners under the ... system,'' said
Walsh, who labeled the law ``fundamentally wrong.''
   He said the Federal Employees Liability Act of 1908 requires
railroad workers injured on the job to sue their employers and show
negligence to receive any compensation.
   ``Unlike the rest of American workers, our people are not
covered by no-fault state workers' compensation,'' Walsh said.
   He said the $600 million cost of the liability act in 1986 was
equal to 80 percent of the $747 million in total profits by the
nation's railroads in 1986.
   Railroads are not having too many accidents, he said. Between
1981 and 1986, the number of employees injured dropped by 53
percent, partly because rail employment declined by 35 percent.
   As a result, federal liability claims per 100 employees dropped
by 21 percent during that time, he said.
   ``Yet the number of FELA cases resolved through lawsuits more
than doubled, and the payout under FELA went from $400 million to
$600 million,'' Walsh said.
   The law is still on the books because it is a source of revenue
for lawyers, said Walsh, a law school graduate.
   Walsh said an employee who loses a leg in a railroad accident
``is thrown into a virtual lottery system. In one court, he may
receive millions ... in another, nothing.''
   By requiring blame in accidents, FELA encourages each side to
accuse the other rather than helping the injured worker and
preventing similar accidents, Walsh said.
   ``The trauma of intense litigation and the uncertainty of
recovering damages increases the distress of the injured
employee,'' he said.
   If the statute were repealed and rail workers were placed in the
same workers' compensation system as others, he said, employees
would benefit from more certain and uniform compensation, faster
payment, greater incentives for rehabilitation and reduced friction
between employees and management.
   Walsh said attorneys who represent injured workers ``have
mounted an aggressive media campaign which misrepresents the FELA
as a safety statute,'' and that some labor groups also oppose
repeal.

   Stocks slipped again this morning in slack
trading after a sharp drop in the previous session, which brokers
blamed on investor apathy and fear of inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 3.32 to
1,983.09 by 11 a.m. EDT. Broader market indices also fell.
   Brokers said many investors still were reacting to the sharp
drop in the trade deficit reported Tuesday by the Commerce
Department. Although the $9.7 shortfall for March was the lowest
monthly level in three years, the shrinkage was regarded on Wall
Street as further evidence of a resurgent economy.
   ``You're seeing a market that is a little confused,'' said Hank
Striefler, senior vice president on the trading floor at Shearson

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans leading the way as
meteorologists predicted rain in most crop-growing areas.
   Showers were developing over the central Great Plains this
morning and were expected to move slowly eastward, bringing badly
needed moisture to most of the Midwest by this weekend.
   The prospects of precipitation pressured the soybean and grain
markets from the opening bell. Soybean prices have soared in recent
weeks due to a lack of moisture, which is needed to get newly
planted seeds to sprout.
   Soybean prices held above Tuesday's lows in early trading, which
could encourage some buying, said Joel Karlin, an analyst in
Chicago with Research Department Inc.
   ``But I look for the market to be on the defensive for most of
the day,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.16} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 3 cents lower with May at $2.06} a bushel; oats were \ cent to
1\ cents lower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents

   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

   Housing construction edged up 0.5 percent in
April, the third monthly gain in a row after a sharp slump at the
end of last year, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the increase pushed construction
activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units.
   But all of the strength came in apartment construction, which
often has wide month-to-month swings. Construction of single-family
homes, a closely watched category, posted a decline, which analysts
blamed on rising interest rates.
   ``In the single-family, it's a little bit discouraging to see
starts fall off like that, but at the same time we've started to
see interest rates drift up,'' said Thomas M. Holloway, senior
economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   ``Our outlook is for interest rates to continue to drift up over
the year and for ... starts to continue to decline modestly,'' he
said.
   The overall increase last month followed a gain of 2.3 percent
in March and 9.9 percent in February. But housing activity was
still 4.5 percent below last year, in part because of declines in
December and January.
   Housing starts plummeted 15.8 percent in December and then fell
another 1.2 percent in January. Analysts attributed the slump to
builders' fear that the October stock market crash would dampen
home buying. Since then the economy has proved to be robust and
interest rates have emerged as the new threat to housing activity.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economic
activity, fell 4.1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.42 million units.
   The strength in starts last month came entirely in construction
of multi-family units, which soared 23.3 percent to 466,000 units.
That more than offset a 6.9 percent decline in single-family units,
which fell by 6.9 percent.
   It was the reverse of the usual pattern. Apartment construction
has been depressed since early 1987 because the new tax law removed
many of the benefits of investing in real estate.
   The overall increase in April was paced by a 22.4 percent rise
in the Midwest and a 5.2 percent climb in the South.
   Housing starts fell 8.9 percent in the Northeast and 13.0
percent in the West.

<HEAD>Tight Reserves, Weather Could Cause Wild Fluctuations in Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The soybean market is likely to fluctuate
wildly this summer in response to factors ranging from weather
conditions to the amount of U.S. soybean exports to the Soviet
Union, several economists say.
   The market already is more sensitive than usual because of tight
U.S. reserves, the economists said.
   Iowa State University extension economist Robert Wisner says
prices could drop sharply by September after reaching a peak. He
based the prediction on market performance during six previous
years with tight soybean supplies and barring a widespread drought.
   Higher spring prices during those years prompted farmers to
plant more soybeans, pushing prices down, he said. The scenario
could be repeated this year.
   The years 1973, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982 and 1984 were marked by a
tight soybean supply, a strong price rally in the spring,
larger-than-indicated plantings and a sharp decline in prices by
Sept. 1, he said.
   ``This year, we have the tight bean supply and the spring price
rally, we could have the increased acreage, so the market pattern
could be very similar,'' Wisner said in a telephone interview with
the Omaha World-Herald from his Ames, Iowa, office.
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower Wednesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade with soybeans leading the way as meteorologists
predicted rain in most crop-growing areas.
   Concern over dry conditions in the Midwest and a
smaller-than-expected South American soybean crop are responsible
for the recent high prices, said Roger Hoskin, agricultural
economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   The National Weather Service's mid-May to mid-June outlook
predicts dry conditions for most of the soybean-producing states,
including Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   The U.S. soybean supply, now estimated at 1.1 billion bushels,
is expected to drop to 145 million bushels by Sept. 1, 1989. Stocks
at that level represent 7 percent of the annual use, Wisner said.
   When stocks drop below 10 percent of annual use, he said, the
market has traditionally been volatile.
   Another factor is uncertainty over soybean exports to the Soviet
Union. Since September, that country has bought 831,000 metric tons
from the United States, said Tom Bickerton, a USDA economist.
   The Soviets expect to buy about 1 million more metric tons by
Aug. 31, but, Bickerton said, ``anything is possible.''

   Stocks slipped again this morning in slack

blamed on investor apathy and fear of inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 7.30 to

   Brokers said many investors still were reacting to the sharp
drop in the trade deficit reported Tuesday by the Commerce

lowest monthly level in three years, the shrinkage was regarded on
Wall Street as further evidence of a resurgent economy.
   ``You're seeing a market that is a little confused,'' said Hank

   The Chicago Board Options Exchange has announced
disciplinary actions against four people.
   In the most serious case, Thomas Urreiztieta Kadala, a former
registered representative in the Caracas, Venezuela, office of
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, was censured and suspended
from exchange membership for one year.
   Kadala was accused of making transactions in the accounts of
three Merrill Lynch customers without the required written customer
authorization.
   Kadala, who did not respond to the allegations, also was accused
of failing to disclose to his subsequent employer, Bear Stearns &
Co., that he had been disciplined in connection with his conduct at
Merrill Lynch and that he had previously been known by another name.
   In the other cases announced Tuesday, an exchange member was
suspended for one week for making trades for his own account while
the account was in deficit, and two former exchange members were
suspended until they file required reports on their income,
expenses and other related financial information.

   Macmillan Inc. common stock rocketed higher
today following an unsolicited $1.5 billion takeover proposal from
a group led by Texas financier Robert M. Bass.
   The chairman of publishing concern, addressing shareholders at
the company's annual meeting this morning, said Macmillan's board
had not had a chance to discuss the proposal but said the company
was not for sale.
   The $64-a-share proposal was disclosed after the stock market
had closed Tuesday. By midday today, Macmillan stock had soared $20
a share to $70.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   As the shareholder's meeting convened today, Chairman Edward P.
Evans noted he had received an unsolicited inquiry about the
possible sale of the company. He said company management felt
confident about Macmillan's growth potential, and added that the
company ``is not for sale.''
   But he also said that since the offer was disclosed so recently,
Macmillan's board had not had a chance to discuss it and declined
further comment.
   Bass, who heads the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. in Fort Worth,
Texas, disclosed Tuesday that he had sent a letter to Evans in
which he proposed paying acquiring all of Macmillan's stock.
   Bass said the offer was ``intended to be consensual'' and was
conditioned upon approval by the Macmillan board of directors and
on Macmillan not issuing any additional equity securities.
   A proposal to authorize issuance of new preferred stock was on
today's meeting agenda, and the company said shareholders approved
it.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bass
said his group owned about 2.4 million Macmillan shares, or about
9.1 percent of the company's 26.1 million common shares outstanding.
   In the letter to Evans, Bass said the $64-a-share price was
based on publicly available information and could be increased if
non-public information indicated a higher price is warranted.
   He said he hoped Evans and Macmillan senior management could be
persuaded to participate in the transaction.
   Bass said the offer also was conditioned on obtaining the
necessary financing, and said his group has about $250 million
available to purchase equity and subordinated debt of Macmillan.
   Acquisition of Macmillan would not be the Bass Group's first
venture into publishing.
   The proposal came as shareholders of Bell & Howell Co., a
publishing and information services company based in Skokie, Ill.,
approved a buyout offer valued at about $700 million from an
affiliate of the Bass group and senior management.
   Macmillan, based in New York, publishes educational textbooks
aimed at elementary through college grade levels as well as books
of general interest.
   It offers information services, such as Who's Who listings and
demographic information, and has interests in instructional
services including the Katherine Gibbs business schools and Berlitz
language training.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Macmillan reported a profit of $70.7
million, or $2.74 a share, compared with earnings of $59.5 million,
or $2.47 a share, a year earlier.
   Annual revenue rose to $955.8 million from $817.8 million in
1986.
   For the first quarter, Macmillan reported a loss of $2.7 million
in contrast to a loss of $2.5 million a year earlier. Revenue for
the quarter rose to $182.6 million from $165.1 million a year
earlier.
   The first quarter normally is weak for Macmillan because of the
seasonality of its textbook business.

   Merv Griffin and Donald Trump resumed their
on-again, off-again negotiations for control of Resorts
International Inc. Wednesday, a week after talks about the casino
company collapsed amid mutual recriminations.
   Terms of the discussion are roughly the same as those previously
announced: Griffin, the former talk-show host turned businessman
would pay about $205 million, or $36 a share for most of the
Atlantic City, N.J., company.
   Griffin also would acquire Trump's Class B shares in the
company, which give the New York real estate developer 88 percent
control of Resorts, and Trump would buy back the huge, unfinished
Taaj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.
   The price for Trump's shares has not been disclosed.
   The announcement by the Griffin Co., in the names of both
Griffin and Trump, said, ``The parties indicated that further talks
would occur and that no assurance could be given as to the results
of those talks.''
   The pair first agreed to a deal April 14 after a month of
sparring.
   On May 11, Trump announced the deal was off, accusing Griffing
of failing to show he could arrange financing and seeking changes
in other, unspecified areas.
   Griffin maintained financing was not a problem, and accused
Trump of trying to rearrange terms of the deal.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed off
11.6 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,777.6.
   Volume was 536.1 million shares, compared with Tuesday's 425.9

involving the purchase and disposal of several stocks accounted for
about 275 million shares of the total volume.
   Several dealers said the market was concerned about the
underlying increase in U.S. imports contained in Tuesday's report
of a $9.7 billion U.S. trade deficit for March, saying that
increase in conjunction with rising exports could prove to be
inflationary.

<HEAD>SEC Disclosures Could Bring More Money Laundering Charges Against
Hutton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New disclosures by the Securities and Exchange
Commission could widen the scope of money laundering charges
against E.F. Hutton & Co., a major brokerage firm that was absorbed
by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The SEC disclosed in documents it made public Tuesday that
Shearson has uncovered possible instances of money laundering at
several New York branch offices of Hutton.
   Shearson, a giant investment firm which acquired Hutton in
December 1987, pleaded guilty on Hutton's behalf Monday to three
criminal counts of money laundering and conspiracy at Hutton's
branch in Providence, R.I. Shearson was fined $1.01 million for the
offenses, which occurred between 1982 and 1984.
   Also Tuesday, the SEC granted Shearson a temporary exemption
from securities laws that would bar it from acting as an investment
adviser in Providence because of its guilty plea.
   The SEC documents, based on information supplied to the agency
early this year by Shearson, said an internal investigation
conducted by Shearson turned up possible cases of money laundering
at several Hutton retail branches in the New York City area.
   The documents did not disclose how much money may have been
laundered through the Hutton branches, the period in which it may
have occurred, or how many branches may have been involved.
   The new disclosures will not have any impact on Shearson's
continuing business operations, said a Shearson spokesman who
declined to be identified.
   According to the documents, Shearson's internal investigation
covered 24 Hutton branches in the New York metropolitan area; four
Hutton branches randomly selected in the financial districts of Los
Angeles, Dallas, Chicago and Miami; and the administrative
departments at Hutton's New York headquarters that were responsible
for the branches concerned.
   The investigation revealed evidence of money laundering, in the
form of unreported currency transactions, at some of the New York
branches prior to Shearson taking over Hutton.
   No such transactions were found in the branches outside New York
that were reviewed, the documents said.
   Cash transactions over $10,000 must be reported to the Internal
Revenue Service. In the Providence case, Hutton and two of its
former brokers were charged with helping clients hide about $1.5
million in cash from the IRS.
   One of the brokers, Brian Lareau, pleaded innocent on Tuesday.
The other broker died of cancer two years ago.
   Shearson said its outside attorneys are studying the possible
involvement of any individuals in these branches. The firm said it
will take appropriate action against any current Hutton employee
involved in violations.

provide about $6.7 million ``as seed money'' for cooperative
audiovisual projects, or about half of the estimated $13.5 million
need for the program. The rest of the funding will come from
private and public groups, he said.
   Ripa de Meana said one project will subsidize distribution of
low-budget films if distributors from at least three nations agree
to distribute them. He estimated 50 films would be eliglble for
such aid this year.
   Low-budget films are those made for less than $2.8 million. They
comprise 80 percent of all films made in the EEC and ``80 percent
of them never cross the frontiers of their country of origin,''
said Ripa de Meana.
   The Media program also proposes to help provide business and
technical training courses for young European producers, create a
group to attract financing and to coordinate the marketing efforts
of 200 independent European film makers.
   ``The aim of this mobilization of intelligence and talent is to
respond to a threat which is already highly evident on our screens,
both large and small,'' Ripa de Meana told a news conference.
   ``Sixty percent of the films distributed in the Community come
from the United States.''
   In addition, he said, more than 70 percent of films and
mini-series on European television are imported, with more than
half of them coming from the United States.
   Ripa de Meana said the number of EEC-produced films has fallen
about 40 percent in the last 15 years.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. reported Wednesday
its second quarter earnings rose 25 percent as sales jumped by a
similar amount.
   Earnings for the quarter ended April 30 totaled $202 million, or
82 cents a share, compared with $162 million, or 63 cents a share,
in the same period a year earlier.
   Second quarter revenue rose 24 percent to $2.5 billion, compared
with $2.02 billion for the same quarter in fiscal 1987, the company
said.
   The manufacturer of computers and scientific instruments also
reported orders were up 20 percent for the quarter over the same
period last year.
   For the six months ended April 30, Hewlett-Packard reported
earnings increased 37 percent to $381 million, or $1.53 a share,
compared with $278 million, or $1.08 a share, for the first two
quarters in fiscal 1987.
   Revenue for the six months jumped 25 percent to $4.69 billion
from $3.76 billion in the same period in 1987.

   Four men were arrested today in a failed scheme
to embezzle $70 million from the nation's 10th-largest bank through
a series of computerized cash transfers, officials said.
   Officials at First National Bank of Chicago credited their own
security system Tuesday with helping foil the sophisticated scheme
involving banks in New York and Chicago. A bank spokesman called it
one of the ``biggest-almost crimes in the country.''
   Federal agents had staked out Chicago's airports shortly after
the failed attempt was revealed by bank officials Tuesday, but
James D. McKenzie, agent in charge of the Chicago office of the
FBI, declined to provide any details about the arrrests of the four
men.
   The four, two from Chicago and two from Detroit, were to appear
before a U.S. magistrate later today, he said.
   The Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, quoting
unidentified sources, reported today the money ultimately was to be
channeled to Vienna, Austria, where a bank worker had set up
accounts. The newspapers said the suspect had worked at the bank
six to eight years but was not a high-ranking official.
   It was not clear whether the suspect was among those arrested
today.
   No loss is expected to the bank or its customers, the bank said.
   The worker has been identified, but may not have acted alone,
said bank spokesman Tony Zehnder. He refused to give details,
saying the investigation had been turned over to the FBI. He would
not say how the bank learned of the scheme.
   FBI spokesman Jim Kuntzelman said his agency was studying the
possibility that up to seven people were involved in the scheme,
which affected the accounts of the New York-based financial firm
Merrill Lynch & Co., Chicago-based United Airlines and Louisville,
Ky.-based Brown-Forman Corp., the wine and spirits company.
   No arrests were made and no charges were filed by Tuesday night,
Kuntzelman said.
   ``It was really the efficiency and the soundness of our controls
that allowed us to thwart this embezzlement,'' Zehnder said. ``This
has to be one of the biggest almost-crimes in the country. We're
quite pleased that our system came through for us.''
   At many banks, money can be transfered to various accounts by
computer. A person with access to certain accounts and computer
codes could transfer by wire large sums of money from Chicago to
banks in New York, and from there to international banks.
   ``You could set up an endless chain of wire transfers with the
right connections,'' Zehnder said.
   Merrill Lynch issued a statement saying it discovered Monday
that $20 million was missing from its account and rumors of huge
losses circulated on Wall Street, forcing First National to issue a
statement on the discovery of the scheme.
   United Airlines declined comment Tuesday, and officials of
Brown-Forman could not be reached at company headquarters Tuesday
night.
   Neither Zehnder nor Merrill Lynch gave details of the fraudulent
transfers. But the Tribune and Sun Times said the employee wired
the funds to Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, from
which it was to be transferred to Vienna.
   The newspapers said the employee used fake tape recordings of
the voices of two Merrill Lynch officials who were authorized to
approve wire transfers. One of the officials was in California at
the time, the other in the hospital.
   Zehnder said $50 million of the transferred money was back in
Chicago, and the rest was expected back today.
   As of Dec. 31, 1987, First National had deposits of about $27.2
billion, according to American Banker, a trade newspaper. First
Chicago Corp., the bank's parent company, was No. 10 among bank
holding companies, with assets of about $44.2 billion.

<HEAD>News Corp. Reports Gain for Nine-Month Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. Ltd., the media conglomerate
controlled by financier Rupert Murdoch, said Wednesday that its
profit in the nine months ended March 31 rose 28.8 percent over the
same period a year earlier.
   The company, which is based in Sydney, Australia, did not
provide figures for the latest quarter.
   A statement said News Corp.'s earnings rose to 300.5 million
Australian dollars, or about $231 million, in the first three
quarters of its 1988 fiscal year. That compared with a profit of
233.3 million dollars in the 1987 period.
   Revenue rose to 4.44 billion Australian dollars, or about $3.2
billion, up 13 percent 3.92 billion Australian dollars in 1987.
   The company's primary businesses include newspaper, magazine and
book publishing, along with motion picture and television
production and distribution. It has operations in the United
States, Britain, Australia and Pacific Basin countries.
   Media Corp. attributed its gains to ``income from acquisitions
in Australia and Pacific Basin, increased profits from Australian
and United Kingdom publishing operations and foreign exchange
trading gains.''
   ``These gains were partly offset by reduced earnings in the
United States, lower dividend income and higher interest expense,''
the statement said.
   The company said its U.S. operating earnings were 8 percent
lower in the latest nine-month period, at 291.7 million Australian
dollars, or about $225 million.
   It said fiscal 1987 U.S. earnings were buoyed by two very
profitable movies releases by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. This
year's performance reflects the ``difficult comparisons for motion
picture operations and results for the television stations that
were below expectations,'' it said.

<HEAD>Europeans Attack US Farm Policy And Subsidy Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States renewed its call Wednesday for a
global elimination of government aid to farmers, but the proposal
came under heavy attack from major European countries.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told a meeting of
trade and finance ministers from 24 leading industrial nations the
U.S. government was ready to ``bite the political bullet'' on
agricultural subsidies.
   But he added that a U.S. proposal for banning all
trade-distorting farm subsidies by the year 2000 _ made last June
by President Reagan _ was conditioned on all U.S. trading partners
doing the same.
   ``It is time for all of us to pay more than lip service to the
reform of agricultural trade,'' Lyng told the regular spring
meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
   He likened government use of farm subsidies to the practice of
dumping urban waste in rivers and streams.
   ``The economic pollution which results causes all kinds of
instability and distress, leading inevitably to social and
political turmoil,'' he said.
   The U.S. farm proposal is opposed by the European Economic
Community, which represents 12 European countries on trade issues.
   Willy De Clercq, the EEC's top trade official, told the meeting
the U.S. approach was unrealistic. He said the EEC, or Common
Market, would not budge from its view that short-term reforms in
agriculture policy are needed before the longer-term U.S. aims can
be considered.
   Farm policy reforms _ including proposals put forth by
Washington, the EEC, Canada and others _ are in the early stages of
negotiation in the Uruguay Round of trade talks in the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The GATT sets and monitors
world trade rules.
   Lyng said the Paris meeting, while not a negotiating forum,
should endorse ``a framework for action'' between now and December,
when GATT trade ministers will meet to review progress on
agricultural and other issues.
   After Wednesday's session Lyng told reporters that experts from
the 24 participating countries would meet overnight to seek
agreement on the specific language of a Paris communique to be
issued at the close of discussions Thursday.
   Asked whether the Reagan administration wanted a specific
commitment from its trading partners to set a target date for
eliminating farm subsidies, Lyng declined to comment directly.
   ``Our position is clear. You know what our position is, what we
tabled in the GATT,'' he said. ``We'd like to see that accepted, or
at least a statement consistent with that in the acceptance of a
long-term objective.''
   Jacques Poos, the treasury minister of Luxembourg, said the
atmosphere of the debate on farm policy was friendly but yielded no
indications that a consensus would be reached.
   Michael Wilson, the Canadian finance minister, told reporters
his government was pushing hard to find a middle ground between
Washington and the Europeans.
   ``We have very definite positions taken'' by the ``two
extremes,'' he said, adding that Ottawa felt frustrated at the lack
of progress in the GATT on agricultural issues.
   De Clercq accused the Reagan administration of souring the
atmosphere in the GATT farm talks by increasing its subsidies for
farm product exporters seeking to compete with the Common Market
exporters.
   An EEC position paper issued at the Paris meeting attacked U.S.
farm policy on several fronts and suggested that the U.S. proposal
for eliminating subsidies was little more than a smokescreen. It
said the effects of U.S. farm programs were damaging to the world
economy.
   ``They create an imbalance ... between those who are reforming
their agricultural policy ... and those who, while parading grand
ambitions for a distant future, practice day after day a policy
which is likely to lead to confrontation on world markets,'' the
paper said.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed higher Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade after some meteorologists modified
their forecasts for badly needed rain in crop-growing areas.
   But most forecasters continued to predict weekend showers in the
Midwest.
   Wheat futures turned in an unusually strong performance as talk
circulated that dry weather had damaged enough of the maturing soft
red winter wheat crop to significantly affect yields, analysts said.
   ``Some people are disappointed in the yield prospects as some
dryness continues to persist during this critical growing peroid,''
said Steve Freed, an analyst in Chicago with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybean futures have been extremely sensitive to weather and
other supply factors because U.S. stockpiles are declining.
   Talk that Congress may approve a measure allowing soybean
planting on corn set-aside acreage next year prompted some
spread-type activity by traders who sold soybean contracts for
November delivery while buying contracts for near-term delivery,
Freed said.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 5} cents higher with May at
$3.23 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with May at $2.09
a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher with May at $1.63\
a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 8\ cents higher with May at
$7.56{ a bushel.

   Stocks stumbled badly this afternoon in active
trading, wrenching the Dow Jones average down more than 30 points
in a selloff that brokers blamed on investor fear of inflation and
rising interest rates.
   The slide accelerated when large institutional investors such as
pension funds sold stock, as yields on the key 30-year Treasury
bond flirted with the 9.3 percent level, the highest since the
October crash.
   ``Today's the first day I've seen some real institutional
liquidations,'' said William King, head trader at Nikko Securities
Co. International in New York. ``You're getting some
acknowledgement from institutional investors that there's a
problem.''
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 21.22 points
Tuesday despite good economic news, was down another 36.64 points
as of 3 p.m. EDT to 1,949.77. Broader market indices also fell
sharply.
   Brokers said many investors still were reacting to the drop in
the trade deficit reported Tuesday by the Commerce Department.
Although the $9.7 billion shortfall for March was the lowest
monthly level in three years, it was regarded on Wall Street as
further evidence of a resurgent economy and therefore higher
inflation.
   ``You're seeing a market that is a little confused,'' said Hank
Striefler, senior vice president on the trading floor at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``People are interpreting good news
as bad news.''
   Many investment professionals said the stock market was strongly
influenced by rising yields in the bond market, a sensitive
barometer of inflation and the economy. Higher yields are making
bonds more attractive than stocks, especially during times of
investment uncertainty.
   Losers outnumbered gains by about 4-to-1 on the NYSE, with 1,276
down, 258 up and 408 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 188.44 million shares with an
hour of trading left, though the figure was inflated by
dividend-related trading strategies in Philadelphia Electric, down
[ to 18 on volume exceeding 64 million shares.
   MacMillan soared 17{ to 68[ following disclosure late Tuesday
that a group led by Texas financier Robert M. Bass offered to buy
the company for $64 a share.
   Other notable takeover-related stocks included Lucky Stores,
which jumped 3[ to 64\ after American Stores Inc. sweetened its
offer for the rival grocery chain to $65 a share.
   Among prominent blue-chips, IBM fell 1[ to 109, General Motors
fell 1} to 75\, Merck fell 2} to 148|, DuPont fell 3[ to 80 and
Coca-Cola fell 1\ to 35\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed issues was down 2.21 to
142.44. The American Stock Exchange's market-value index fell 3.70
to 292.87.

<HEAD>U.S. Petroleum Imports Up 22 Percent in April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. imports of crude oil rose 24.1 percent in
April from year-earlier levels while total domestic production
registered a 2.7 percent decline, a trade association reported
Wednesday.
   And, the American Petroleum Institute said, unlike previous
months, the latest domestic production figure did not include a
year-to-year increase in Alaskan output to partially offset a
decline in the lower 48 states.
   In its Monthly Statistical Report, Washington-based API said
U.S. imports of crude oil and petroleum products averaged 7.04
million 42-gallon barrels a day in April, up from 5.77 million
barrels daily in April 1987.
   Domestic crude production averaged an estimated 8.17 million
barrels a day in April, compared with 8.4 million barrels daily
last April, while deliveries of domestic refined products slipped
by 0.1 percent, it said.
   The report said demand for petroleum products in April, as
measured by domestic deliveries from primary storage, was not much
different from that of last April.
   But over the first four months of this year, it was a different
story, with deliveries increasing to 17.44 million barrels daily _
a ``surprisingly high'' 4.6 percent gain over the 1987 period, said
Gene Johnson, an API spokesman.
   ``In previous years, 1 percent or 2 percent was considered high,
so a 4.6 percent was very, very unexpected. It's a significant
increase,'' he added.
   The report said this April's inventories rose by 22 million
barrels because of higher imports and below-trend deliveries,''
although April's totals, on average, ``have historically shown
little direction during the month.''
   ``Crude oil stocks accounted for half of the increase. Gasoline
stocks held nearly steady, while distillate inventories, in a
contraseasonal move, rose slightly,'' it added.
   Distillates refer to diesel oil and heating oil.

   When the U.S. trade deficit for March improved
beyond all expectations, many economists and big investors
responded with a chorus of ``Bah, humbug.''
   Funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news. But
they've done it before and most likely they'll do it again.
   They responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate, to
increases in factory use, even to the dollar's new stability.
   It is a strange, discomfiting world in which good is bad, happy
is sad, up is down, square is round, best is worst, last is first,
strong is weak, bottom is peak, rich is poor and less is more.
   And if the sages are being spooked by the ``good'' news _ news
for which they've waited months and which they deemed necessary for
economic survival _ it's no wonder they're exaggerating ``bad''
news, of which they've found plenty.
   Late last year, for instance, the pessimists said consumers
would reduce spending, forcing the economy into recession. It
didn't happen. Then they said an inventory glut might produce
recession in 1988. But the glut disappeared.
   ``It is ironic that the pessimistic crowd see a boom just as
bloated inventories are starting to cool things off,'' said
economist Edward Yardeni of the Prudential-Bache investment firm,
who fears neither a boom nor a bust.
   Throughout, there has been wide disagreements among economists,
some of whom believed the biggest threat was from recession, others
that inflation would turn out to be the big problem.
   Whatever the interpretation, however, the conclusion has been
the same, i.e., bad news. If the economy expanded it would strain
production facilities and produce inflation. Should expansion
cease, recession would follow.
   The dramatic improvement in the nation's trade deficit _ a $4
billion reduction to $9.7 billion in March _ provides the most
vivid example of the syndrome.
   Nothing economic has been more eagerly awaited in recent months,
since a shrinkage of the deficit means U.S. goods, especially
manufactured items, are becoming more competitive abroad.
   In fact, many economists and investors made the latest trade
figures the fulcrum of their analyses. When the deficit grew in
February, the stock market plunged. Would a gain in March make the
market rise?
   It didn't happen. Once again the news, though opposite to that
of February, produced a negative reaction. Both the bond and stock
markets interpreted the news as indicative of an economy about to
overheat and produce inflation.
   ``It seems the better things get, the worse they're going to
be,'' quipped Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, who was addressing a
business luncheon group shortly after hearing the news.
   Why the mood?
   Economists themselves have been asking that question, and most
have defended their positions with data and theories that to the
layman seem thorough, reasonable and even sagacious.
   While recognizing that pessimism may be justified _ and that
inflation, high interest rates and perhaps recession lie ahead _
some economists believe there is a large psychological element
involved.
   In fact, with so many disproportions and dislocations in the
economy _ big budget and trade deficits, uncollectable Third World
loans, and the crash of the securities markets in October _ no
matter how poor or inaccurate an analysis might be, a negative
forecast stands a chance of being correct.
   There are also the awful memories of the 1970s to contend with.
Economists back then couldn't believe what was happening _ that
inflation and interest rates were not just high but in the double
digits. They cannot forget.
   And, finally, anxiety is produced by the very expansion itself.
Now in its 66th month, it has lived far beyond the usual lifespan
of expansions, and inevitably will turn down. But when? And will
inflation or recession end it?
   H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist for Ladenburg, Thalmann&
Co., a securities broker-dealer, remains optimistic, at least about
inflation. He notes that major inflation indicators rose less in
the first quarter of 1988 than in the final quarter of 1987.
   His forecast contrasts with that of most economists.
   ``We're convinced that with just a little bit of luck, the
expansion could continue into 1991 or 1992,'' he says, adding the
caveat:
   ``However, this will be a respite, not a reprieve. If Washington
cannot deal with its problems (mainly the budget deficit), we will
all have to live with the consequences.''

<HEAD>MG Says Sugarman Offers Deal for Cable TV Holdings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California investor Burt Sugarman on
Wednesday denied he had offered to end his attempt to name three
directors of Media General Inc. in exchange for control of the
firm's cable television franchises.
   Media General officials said the offer was made through
Sugarman's financial advisers.
   But Sugarman said, ``I do not make offers through advisers.
Media General knows that all my offers are made in writing to the
company.''
   Sugarman has offered to buy Media General for $70 per share, or
a total of $2 billion.
   James S. Evans, president and chief executive officer of Media
General, and J. Stewart Bryan III, vice chairman of Media General
and publisher of the Richmond News Leader and the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, said the proposal to end the proxy contest was made
Monday.
   Evans said Sugarman offered to sell the Class A common stock he
owns or controls _ about 2.8 million shares, or 10.1 percent of the
Class A stock _ ``in exchange for equity _ at a bargain-basement
price _ in our 163,000-subscriber cable systems'' in Fairfax County
and Fredericksburg.
   Evans said the offer, which was rejected, also included a
provision by which Sugarman would agree to drop his attempt to have
himself and two business associates, Harold Simmons and David
Gotterer, named Class A directors at the company's annual
stockholders' meeting Friday.
   The company has recommended re-election of three directors at
the meeting.
   Sugarman, in a release from his Beverly Hills, Calif.,
headquarters, called the Media General statement ``a desperate move
to make it appear as though we are losing the proxy contest. In my
opinion, this last-minute trick just won't work.''
   Sugarman's proposal called for him to exchange his stock
holdings for about 43 percent of a new company formed from the
cable TV operations, while other shareholders could trade their
shares, on a pro-rata basis, for the cable company's remaining
equity, Evans said in a statement.
   Media General employees who own stock in the company would not
be permitted to own stock in the cable TV company, nor would
members of the Bryan family, who control Media General through
their Class B common shares.
   Company employees own nearly 10 percent of Media General Class A
stock, and the Bryan family owns 12 percent of the Class A stock.
Bryan family members also own 70 percent of the Class B stock,
which can elect seven directors.
   ``Sugarman's proposition is that we value Fairfax Cable at $300
million, which would clearly be undervaluing that asset by 50 to
100 percent,'' Evans said. According to Evans, Sugarman's proposal
would grant him ``working control of the system and treat various
shareholders inequitably.''
   The Media General board saw the offer as ``greenmail of the most
egregious sort and quickly rejected it,'' he said.
   New York media analyst Curtis L. Alexander, who has followed the
Media General-Sugarman takeover fight, said he would not be
surprised to see Sugarman's per-share offer go up to $75 before
Friday's meeting.
   ``Why not? He knows he can pay that much and still break up the
company for a profit,'' Alexander said.

<HEAD>Biggest Service Companies Had Rough Time in 1987, Fortune Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailing was one of the few bright spots last
year in the service sector of the economy, according to a new
survey released Wednesday.
   Fortune magazine, in its annual survey of the nation's 500
largest non-industrial companies, found most service companies had
a rough time in 1987. The October stock market crash brought a
slump in the brokerage business, while savings institutions
continued to suffer from a rash of bad loans and major commercial
banks continued to sustain losses on loans to developing countries.
   Total profits for the 500 biggest service companies dropped 22
percent in 1987 to $50.8 billion, Fortune said. By contrast, the
annual Fortune 500 survey of the leading industrial companies,
released last month, showed a 41 percent jump in profits, to $91
billion.
   Recent economic statistics _ such as the U.S. trade deficit for
March and factory use data for April released on Tuesday _ have
indicated a resurgence of traditional ``smokestack'' industries.
The trade figures included a jump in exports to an all-time high of
$28.97 billion, which factories have been running at full capacity
to produce.
   Service industries, on the other hand, had few successes in 1987
other than retailing, life insurance and transportation, the
Fortune survey found.
   ``Shoppers supplied most of the oomph in the service economy
last year,'' the magazine said. ``By keeping cash registers ringing
even after many economists thought they would be immobilized by the
stock market crash, consumers carried the 50 largest retailers to a
9 percent jump in total profits'' to $8.28 billion.
   Top retailers riding the crest of the consumer wave included
first-ranked Sears, Roebuck, followed by K Mart, Safeway Stores,
Kroger and Wal-Mart Stores.
   The companies in the service survey, like Fortune 500 firms,
were ranked by sales.
   American Express became the largest diversified financial
company for the first time in 1987, displacing Federal National
Mortgage Association which slipped into second place, followed by
Salomon, Aetna Life & Casualty and Merrill Lynch.
   BankAmerica, once the nation's biggest commercial bank, dropped
to third place behind Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. Chemical New
York was fourth and J.P. Morgan & Co. placed fifth.
   Savings institutions were led by Financial Corp. of America,
H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western Financial Corp., Calfed and Meritor
Financial Group.
   Among diversified service companies, Super Valu Stores was
first, followed by Fleming Cos., McKesson, Hospital Corp. of
America and Ryder System.
   Allegis, the parent of first-ranked United Airlines, was the
leading transportation company, followed by United Parcel Service
of America; Texas Air, the parent of Eastern Airlines and
Continental Airlines; CSX and AMR, the parent of American Airlines.
   The biggest utilities were GTE, Bellsouth, Nynex, Pacific Gas &
Electric and Southwestern Bell.
   Leading life insurance companies were Prudential of America,
Metropolitan Life, Equitable Life Assurance, Aetna Life and
Teachers Insurance & Annuity.

   Dart Group Corp. said Wednesday it acquired
half the stock of Jumbo Food Stores Inc., which operates 18
discount grocery stores in Maryland and Virginia.
   Jumbo management, however, will retain operational control of
the chain of Shoppers Food Warehouses, Dart spokesman Stanley
Rubenstein said.
   Kenneth Herman, Jumbo executive vice presient, did not return a
reporter's calls for comments Wednesday.
   Jumbo stock is privately held by the Herman family, Rubenstein
said.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Dart has unsuccessfully tried to acquire some of the largest
retailers in the country in the past several years.
   The Landover-based company owns Trak Auto Corp., a chain of
discount auto parts stores; Crown Books Corp., a chain of discount
book stores and Dart Group Financial Corp., a financial business
which purchases bankers' acceptances.
   Dart acquisition targets have included May Department Stores in
1985, Jack Eckerd Corp. in 1985, Safeway Stores in 1986,
Supermarkets General Corp. in 1987, Dayton Hudson Corp. in 1987 and
Stop & Shop Co. this year.
   In April the Haft family, which controls Dart, said they
intended to buy up to $15 million in F.W. Woolworth Co. stock.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday approved construction of a new fiber optic cable under
the Atlantic Ocean to link the United States and Canada with points
in Europe and the Mediterranean region.
   The cable, known as TAT-9, is due to be put in service in 1991.
   It will have the capacity to transmit 80,000 simultaneous
conversations _ twice the capacity of another optical fiber cable
scheduled to go into service between the United States and Europe
this year.
   The cable is expected to cost the U.S. carriers and more than 25
foreign companies participating in the project about $400 million.
   The U.S. carriers, with a combined 38.5 percent stake in the
project, include American Telephone & Telegraph Co., MCI
International, US Sprint, TRT Telecommunications, FTCC
Communications, Comsat Communications Inc. and Western Union World
Communications. AT&T owns the largest share at 28.7 percent.
   The cable will link points in the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom, France and Spain. It also will connect to cable
systems linking Spain and Italy and between Italy, Turkey, Greece
and Israel.

<HEAD>Dollar Rally Comes to Halt; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower Wednesday against most
major currencies except the Canadian dollar as a rally inspired by
a positive U.S. trade performance ran out of steam.
   Gold prices rose in New York after closing mixed overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $455.50 for a
troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $453.75 late Tuesday.
   The dollar rode a wave of bullishness after the Commerce
Department reported Tuesday that the trade deficit fell to $9.75
billion in March from $13.83 billion in February. The rally spilled
over into Asian and European trading Wednesday, but fizzled in
later dealings in New York.
   Traders said the dollar's advance was halted mainly by a lack of
momentum and by technical market factors. The modest recovery in
gold prices also contributed to the dollar's decline, they said.
   ``People thought the dollar had been overbought,'' said Dan
Holland, a vice president of Discount Corp. in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 125.53 Japanese yen from
124.82 yen late Tuesday. In later London trading, it retreated to
125.33 yen. By the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar
settled at 124.93 yen, down from 125.75 yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound declined in London to $1.8605 from $1.8630.
Sterling recovered later in New York, rising to $1.8675 from
$1.8603 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.7007 West German marks, down from 1.7065;
1.4182 Swiss francs, down from 1.4233; 5.7575 French francs, down
from 5.7795; 1,263.50 Italian lire, down from 1,267.00; and 1.2463
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2370.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.7055 West German marks, up from 1.7045; 1.4215
Swiss francs, up from 1.4190; 5.7700 French francs, down from
5.7710; 1.9090 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9060; 1,265.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,264.00; 1.24125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2358.
   The bid price for gold was $453.70 a troy ounce in London late
Wednesday, up slightly from $453.50 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, the late bid price was $454, down from
$455.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to a closing bid of $454.54
from $454.67.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
settled at $457.30 a troy ounce, up from $455.50 late Tuesday.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $6.58 a troy ounce,
down 1 cent.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at
$6.685 a troy ounce, up from $6.540 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Platinum Prices Surge On Outlook For Inflation, Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures surged about $10 a troy ounce Wednesday and
helped rally the other precious metals as the markets digested new
indications of inflation and economic growth.
   In other trading, energy futures were sharply higher; grains and
soybeans advanced; stock-index futures sank; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Fears of inflation have been supporting precious metals futures
prices since the October stock market crash. Fresh indications of
economic vitality, such as Tuesday's government report of a
dramatic narrowing of the trade deficit, are viewed as especially
constructive for platinum and silver, which double as industrial
metals.
   ``The inflationary scenario is moving the precious metals higher
and the scenario of an expanding economy is moving the industrial
metals higher at a faster clip than gold,'' said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Lower Treasury bond prices _ indicating higher interest rates _
and higher prices for grain, soybean and energy futures, also
supported the metals, said Sharon Ziemian, an analyst at Citibank
in New York.
   Ms. Ziemian said fears of recession have also reawakened on the
metals markets.
   ``There's a fear that you could get a sudden push up in prices
and interest rates across the board, get a quick, sharp pop, and
then you'll get a recession,'' she said.
   Platinum settled $9.90 to $10.10 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in July at
$563.30 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $1.70 to
$2.80 higher with June at $458.10 a troy ounce; silver was 14.5
cents to 15.4 cents higher with May at $6.685 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
reaction to an industry report showing an unexpected buildup last
week in inventories of distillates, including heating oil.
   The re-establishment of diplomatic relations between Paris and
Tehran also weighed on the markets as traders anticipated an
increase in exports of Iranian crude oil to France, said Nauman
Barakat, energy analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 33 cents
lower with June at $17.43 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .71
cent lower with June at 47.07 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.26 cent to .51 cent lower with June at 52.23 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished higher Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after some meteorologists modified their
forecasts for badly needed rain in crop-growing areas.
   But most forecasters continued to predict weekend showers in the
Midwest.
   The National Weather Service, in its six-to-10 day forecast,
predicted normal precipitation in the northern half of the United
States and below-normal precipitation in the southern half from May
24 through May 28.
   Wheat futures turned in an unusually strong performance as talk
circulated that dry weather had damaged enough of the maturing soft
red winter wheat crop to significantly affect yields, analysts said.
   Soybean futures, which are extremely sensitive to weather
factors because U.S. stockpiles are declining, also finished
sharply higher.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents to 6 cents higher with May at $3.23{ a
bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent higher with May at $2.09 a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents higher with May at $1.63\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 8 cents higher with May at $7.56{ a
bushel.
   Stock index futures followed Treasury bond futures lower in a
second consecutive day of steep losses.
   The contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 4 points lower at 251.10 on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. On the Chicago Board of Trade, the June T-bond contract
settled 24-32 point lower at 85 18-32.
   Most cattle futures moved higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as the futures market continued to chase strong cash
prices, which are running about 3{ cents above futures, analysts
said.
   Hog futures advanced in anticipation of a seasonal cash rally
but frozen pork-belly futures fell on expectations that a
government report due out Friday will show near-record stocks, said
Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington
Heights, Ill.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .80 cent higher with June
at 73.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .42 cent
higher with May at 81.27 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to
.32 cent higher with June at 53.25 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .43 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 53.37
cents a pound.

   Union Carbide Corp. and General Electric
Co. on Wednesday announced a joint venture to combine their
worldwide silicone businesses.
   Philip M. Gross, currently vice president of GE Silicones, will
become president of the venture, which will be called GE-Carbide
Silicone Inc.
   The two business currently have combined annual sales of about
$750 million, the companies said in a joint statement.
   The deal is expected to be completed in the third quarter of
this year, subject to required government review and final approval
by both companies.
   GE is headquartered in Fairfield and Union Carbide is based in
Danbury. The new company will be based in Waterford, N.Y., where GE
has major manufacturing and compounding facilities.
   Gross said GE's silicone business has been second to industry
leader Dow Corning, a joint venture between Dow Chemical and
Corning Glass.
   ``We'll still be smaller but we feel we will have enough of a
larger size to be able to have more resources and more investment
in product development and new market development,'' Gross said.
``The silicone business grows by inventing new products and the
greater the size, the more products you can work on.''

   Stocks slumped for the second straight day
Wednesday on inflation fear and rising interest rates, wrenching
down the key Dow Jones average to the lowest level in more than
three months.
   Brokers expressed concern that some institutional investors such
as pension funds and mutual funds dumped stock late in the day,
intensifying the slide and raising more anxiety about the immediate
outlook for the crash-scarred market. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was the heaviest in more than a month.
   ``Today's the first day I've seen some real institutional
liquidations,'' said William King, head trader at Nikko Securities
Co. International in New York. ``You're getting some
acknowledgement from institutional investors that there's a
problem.''
   The Dow average of 30 industrial fell 35.32 points to 1,951.09,
the lowest level since it closed at 1,914.46 on Feb. 9. Broader
market barometers also fell sharply.
   To a large extent, the drop reflected fear in the financial
markets that surging exports, growth in imports, higher commodity
prices, low unemployment and strains in America's productive
capacities are providing the elements for acute inflation and
tightening interest rates.
   That fear was felt most severely Wednesday in the bond market,
where the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond flirted with 9.3
percent, the highest level since the stock crash seven months ago.
This has convinced many investors that bonds are more attractive
than stocks.
   ``Why take risks in a stock market that in the past three or
four months has been volatile, with not much volume to support
it?,'' said Jack Barbanel, a trading expert at Gruntal & Co. in New
York. ``The flight to quality bonds and risk-controlled investments
is going to be the thing to do.''
   Gordon L. Smith, head of block trading at Alex. Brown & Sons
Inc., a Baltimore-based investment firm, said the drop was a
carryover from the loss on Tuesday, when a government report on the
lowest trade deficit figures in three years intensified fear that
economic strength will cause higher inflation.
   ``With the market unable to respond to good news, people are
just discouraged,'' Smith said.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4-to-1 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,288 down, 283 up
and 417 unchanged.
   NYSE volume totaled 209.42 million shares vs. 133.85 million
Tuesday. It was highest level since a 234.16 million share day
April 15, although the figure was inflated by nearly a third
because of dividend-related trading strategies on Philadelphia
Electric, the Big Board's most-active issue.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 235.43 million shares.
   Among the most prominent issues, MacMillan jumped 18\ to 68~
following the disclosure that Texas investor Robert Bass was
offering $64 a share to acquire the publishing concern. MacMillan
said it wasn't for sale.
   Lucky Stores was another notable takeover stock, rising 3\ to
64] after rival grocery chain American Stores sweetened its
acquisition offer to $65 a share. American Stores fell 2[ to 54~.
   Among the biggest blue-chip losers, IBM fell 1\ to 108~, General
Motors fell 1{ to 75, Merck fell 3 to 148], Boeing fell 1 to 49{
and Procter & Gamble fell 1~ to 71}.
   Hewlett Packard dropped 4| to 57}, apparently reflecting analyst
disappointment with the company's orders and profit margins. Other
technology stocks also fell, including Digital, down 2\ to 101},
Data General, down 1 to 20\, and Compaq, down 1] to 49{.
   The Wilshire Associates 5,000 Equity Index, the market value of
5,000 NYSE, American and OTC issues, fell by $35.85 billion.
   The NYSE index of all listed issues fell 2.14 to 142.51.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 4.95 to 291.76,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 4.04 to 251.35.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 3.78
to 292.79. The NASDAQ composite index for the OTC market closed at
366.99, down 5.28.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Rise As Bond Prices Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates climbed higher as the value of
bonds declined Wednesday, largely because of continued fears of
inflation.
   The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue soared to
9.29 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 9.21 percent and the
highest level since the stock market crash seven months ago. Its
price fell about } point, or $7.50 per $1,000 face amount.
   Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said fears of higher inflation once again dominated the markets,
following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected trade figures.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's trade gap shrank more
than $4 billion in March to $9.7 billion, the lowest monthly
deficit in three years.
   Bondholders, though, view a sharp jump in exports as a sign the
economy could overheat and generate higher inflation, which erodes
the value of fixed-income investments.
   Adding to bondholders' worries Wednesday were reports that the
Federal Reserve took between $2 billion and $3 billion out of the
system, Mrs. Reiners said.
   She said, however, it was unlikely the Fed was tightening its
credit policies. ``It just looks like it was technical,'' she said.
   The closely watched federal funds rate, the interest on
overnight loans between banks, closed at 6 percent, down from 6}
percent late Tuesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell about 1-16 point, intermediate maturities declined
from \ point to 7-16 point and long-term issues were about } point
lower, according to figures provided by the business information
concern Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, lost 0.30 to 108.63. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,137.02, down 3.55.
   Corporate bonds also declined. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.26
to 276.30.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was down about } pont at 18 29-32 as of 3
p.m. EDT. The average yield rose to 8.24 percent from 8.16 percent
late Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down 11 basis points
to 6.19 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage
point. Six-month bills were down 2 basis points at 6.53 percent and
one-year bills were up 1 basis point at 6.89 percent.

   Union Carbide Corp. on Wednesday announced
it was slashing its quarterly dividend by about 33 percent and
planning an offering of about 15 million shares of common stock as
part of a recapitalization plan.
   The Danbury-based chemical giant said it would reduce the
quarterly dividend from 37{ cents to 20 cents, effective with the
Sept. 1 payment.
   ``The combination of high leverage and high dividend payout of
the past few years is inappropriate for our current business
strategies,'' said Union Carbide Chairman Robert Kennedy.
   ``To maintain that combination when financial strength and
flexibility are required in order to capitalize on the best
investment opportunities in years, especially in chemicals and
plastics, would be shortchanging shareholder value,'' he said.
   The company announced the recapitalization plan in November 1986.
   He said the common stock offering and its proceeds, combined
with dividend reduction, will reduce debt and interest costs and
lower the company's debt-to-capital ratio.

<HEAD>Brazil Suspends Debt Negotiations with Bankers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil on Wednesday halted talks with
private bankers on restructuring its $121 billion foreign debt,
because of what it called misunderstandings over the International
Monetary Fund's role and a clause regarding seizure of Brazilian
assets.
   However, Brazilian officials said there was no impasse in the
talks and negotiations were expected to continue later.
   Brazil's two main negotiators returned from New York, where
talks were nearly finished with a committee of 14 banks
representing Brazil's 700 creditors.
   Sergio Amaral, the international representative for the Finance
Ministry, said talks stalled over the past 10 days due to
misunderstanding over two issues.
   He said Brazil wanted to eliminate a condition set by bankers
that the IMF evaluate the Brazilian economy every three months, as
has been the practice.
   Also, Brazil wanted to alter a clause in the debt restructuring
agreement which states that in the case of default, Brazilian
assets abroad may be seized under court order, he said.
   Amaral did not explain how specifically Brazil wants to change
the clause or if it wants it taken entirely out of the agreement.
   Amaral and Antonio de Padua Seixas were in New York for three
weeks putting the finishing touches on an agreement that would
allow Brazil to resume interest payments on the debt, the
developing world's largest.
   Seixas said they left because ``we thought the bankers would
make a counter-proposal and they didn't.''
   He said the next step before negotiations resumed was for the
bankers committee to take Brazil's proposals to creditor banks for

   ``This is not an impasse, it is an opportunity to deepen our
understanding with bankers,'' Amaral said.
   In February 1987, Brazil announced a debt payment moratorium,
saying the country was unable to meet monthly interest payments and
needed to restructure its outstanding debt. Brazil made interest
payments in January and February this year after progress in debt
talks.
   The agreement being worked on includes a $5.8 billion loan to
help pay part of the interest due from 1987 through 1989.

<HEAD>Eastern, Machinists Begin Daily Talks</HEAD>

   After several months of contract talks, Eastern
Airlines and its machinists union will start daily negotiations May
31 in a bid to resolve pay and work rule issues at the heart of
their bitter dispute.
   ``We've got a couple of issues that need further
clarification,'' said federal mediator Harry Bickford. ``And within
a matter of days, I'm going to be taking them out of town to attack
the core issues.''
   The parties will meet at an undisclosed location and negotiate
daily until June 12.
   Eastern has pledged to keep its highest level negotiators at the
talks in an effort to reach a deal with District 100 of the
International Association of Machinists. The union represents
12,000 mechanics and other ground workers at the Miami-based
carrier.
   Although strike talk has been pervasive on both sides, each side
issued carefully crafted statements saying they want a negotiated
deal.
   ``We're going there with the full intention, hopefully, once and
for all, putting something to bed and getting a settlement,'' said
Thomas Matthews, Eastern vice president of human resources. ``Our
goal is to see if we can get an agreement with the IAM.''
   Charles E. Bryan, president of the IAM District 100, said he
also was hopeful that an agreement could be reached, but he
cautioned, ``I've never jumped to any conclusions.''
   ``We're not trying to set the world on fire or establish any new
standards above anybody,'' Bryan said. ``We're just trying to get
what's fair and equitable in the industry.''
   Ever since Texas Air Corp. acquired Eastern, management has
battled the IAM and two other unions over concession demands,
employee treatment and even airline safety. The company recently
sued the IAM and the pilot's union for $1.5 billion, claiming the
unions were trying to drive down the price of the company so they
could buy it.
   Labor has campaigned for investigations of Eastern's safety. The
government just concluded a plane-by-plane inspection of Eastern's
fleet, and is probing Texas Air management.
   Eastern, trying to save $200 million a year, wants to cut the
top hourly pay of mechanics, but the union, citing pay raises at
USAir and Northwest is demanding raises.

<HEAD>Shareholders Meeting On For Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. said Wednesday
its annual shareholders meeting will be held this week as
originally scheduled.
   A federal judge in Pittsburgh on Wednesday overturned a
preliminary injunction issued by U.S. Bankruptcy Court that
temporarily prohibited the meeting from being held.
   Wednesday's ruling clears the way for Friday's meeting and
continuation of a proxy fight between dissident shareholders and
the company.
   Allegheny International Chairman Oliver S. Travers urged
shareholders in a letter Wednesday to reject the efforts of
dissidents to gain majority representation on the company's board.
Travers said the dissidents' board nominees have no experience in
the company's business and no definitive plan for the future.
   The Pittsburgh-based Allegheny International, which is
reorganizing under federal bankruptcy laws, manufactures consumer
products.

<HEAD>Coleco Loss Hits $47.4 Million In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., which is
struggling to stay afloat, on Wednesday reported it lost $47.4
million in the first quarter.
   The loss in the three months ended April 2 compared with an $8.9
million shortfall in the same period of 1987.
   Sales plummeted to $73.7 million from $124.5 million, the toy
manufacturer said.
   Coleco also announced it entered into an agreement with lenders
under its recently expired banking agreements to provide immediate
interim funding. The company said it is continuing to negotiate
with these and other lenders in order to provide additional capital
for 1988 operations.
   The company also said it will seek a buyer for several product
lines, including plastic wading and splasher pools, steel-walled
splasher pools and pool filters, snow products, children's outdoor
furniture and clubhouses and ride-on and battery operated vehicles.
   In 1987 these product lines generated gross sales of $77
million. The company said it does not plan to dispose of any other
product lines.
   Coleco has slipped as its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls declined in
popularity over the last few years. Its problems were exacerbated
by last year's slump in the toy industry.

<HEAD>General Mills Selling Talbots, Eddie Bauer Subsidiaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills said Wednesday it is selling
its Talbots women's clothing subsidiary to the Japanese company
Jusco Co. Ltd. for $325 million, and its Eddie Bauer outdoor
apparel division to Spiegel Inc. for about $260 million.
   Talbots and Eddie Bauer were the only remaining General Mills
subsidiaries not related to food processing and food marketing. The
company's board had been exploring selling the two for several
months.
   The sales will give General Mills an after-tax profit exceeding
$200 million in fiscal 1989, said H.B. Atwater Jr., General Mills'
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company plans to use about two-thirds of the projected net
proceeds to repay debt associated with open market purchases of
over $210 million in General Mills common shares in the second half
of fiscal 1988 and to help finance the company's internal
investment program, Atwater said. He said most of the remainder is
targeted for additional stock repurchases during the next several
months.
   General Mills has 84.3 million common shares outstanding.
   Jusco is one of Japan's largest retailers. The Tokyo company's
diversification efforts included a joint venture company formed
with General Mills in 1982 to develop and operate Red Lobster
restaurants in Japan.
   Talbots, based in Hingham, Mass., sells women's apparel and
accessories in 126 stores in 26 states. Its annual sales from the
stores and its catalogs exceed $340 million, about 6 percent of
General Mills' total.
   Spiegel markets women's and men's apparel, home furnishings and
other general merchandise through catalogs.
   Eddie Bauer is a specialty retailer selling men's and women's
leisure sportswear, gifts and outdoor equipment through catalogs
and 58 retail stores in 14 states and two Canadian provinces.
   Both transactions are expected to be completed within six weeks,
General Mills said.

   FBI agents arrested the former head of the
collapsed Sasson Jeans empire Wednesday for allegedly threatening
the life of the federal bankruptcy judge handling his company's
reorganization.
   Paul Guez, the majority shareholder in Sasson Jeans Inc.,
allegedly threatened the life of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland who was presiding over the Chapter 11 reorganization of the
apparel licensor in Manhattan.
   According to a criminal complaint, Guez, 43, threatened to kill
Lifland and other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceeding on
Monday ``if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached.''
   ``I did not threaten anybody. I am astonished to see I have been
accused of this,'' Guez told U.S. Magistrate Barbara A. Lee during
a marathon hearing in which prosecutors sought to have him detained
without bail and Guez sought his freedom in order to attend another
bankruptcy hearing on Thursday.
   He claimed the charges were ``part of a conspiracy'' to block
his attendance at the confirmation hearing on Sasson's
reorganization plan.
   Ms. Lee ordered Guez held overnight pending a detention hearing
scheduled to take place before the afternoon bankruptcy hearing.
   It wasn't the first time Guez has gotten into hot water over his
combative antics since taking over as his own lawyer in bankruptcy
court.
   Lifland has cited Guez twice for civil contempt and referred the
matters to the district court level.
   Guez is also under indictment for allegedly assaulting a federal
marshal over bankruptcy proceedings.
   The criminal complaint said Guez is currently ``undergoing
psychiatric evaluation concerning his fitness to stand trial'' in
the assault case.
   The complaint was based on information supplied by a
confidential informant described as a lawyer with ``a privileged
professional relationship'' with Guez.
   The complaint further stated that ``due to the tone and
demeanor'' of Guez, the informant believed he was ``fully capable
of carrying out his threat.''
   Sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since October 1986. On
Wednesday Lifland approved the sale of the company's name for $8
million to Stanwich Partners of Stamford, Conn.
   The Tunisian-born Guez arrived in this country in 1976 with $74
and a new style of French cut jeans. Through clever advertising he
took the market by storm and made millions by licensing the Sasson
label for watches, lingerie and luggage as well as jeans.
   But the company began to unravel due to internal feuds and
Sasson was swamped by lawsuits leading to the Chapter 11
reorganization.
