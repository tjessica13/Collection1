<HEAD>Activist To Host '60s Ball To Raise Money For Anti-Nuclear Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman, who gained fame 20
years ago at protests at the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago, plans to be host of a nostalgic ball Sunday to raise money
for anti-nuclear advertising.
   The ``'60s Revival Ball'' at the Pearl Street nightclub here
will feature such entertainment as a musician playing the sound of
a nuclear disaster on his harmonica and free copies of Hoffman's
``Steal This Book'' for the first 10 partygoers who come with their
fathers. Admission is $10.
   Hoffman said he has become fond of Northampton since a local
jury cleared him in April 1987 of disorderly conduct and
trespassing charges stemming from his arrest at a demonstration
against CIA recruiting at the nearby University of Massachusetts.
   Hoffman and 14 other protesters, including Amy Carter, daughter
of former President Jimmy Carter, had argued that they broke minor
trespassing laws to prevent the graver harm of spy agency
recruiting.
   ``I'm not really big on nostalgia, but I do about 20 benefits a
year because raising money on our side of the fence isn't that
easy,'' Hoffman said. ``We're not like the PTL where they can turn
around and raise $12 million by auctioning off Costa Rica.''
   The Northampton benefit was organized by Al Giordano, the moving
force behind a November ballot referendum aimed at closing
Massachusetts' two nuclear power plants by outlawing nuclear waste.
   The money raised by the ball will go to the Anti-Nuclear Media
Fund to buy ad time on behalf of anti-nuclear initiatives
nationwide.
   Filmmaker Douglas Trumball, whose special-effects credits
include ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third
Kind'' and ``E.T.,'' will help design the anti-nuclear ads,
Giordano said.

<HEAD>Miscarriages Overcome by Experimental Treatment, Scientist Says</HEAD>

   Women who had suffered up to 11 consecutive
miscarriages because of an immune system abnormality were able to
give birth after being injected with blood cells from their
husbands, a scientist says.
   The injections made the immune system ignore fetal cells rather
than attacking them and terminating the pregnancy, said
immunologist James Mowbray of St. Mary's Hospital in London.
   The experimental treatment produces a birth on the next try at
pregnancy in 85 percent to 90 percent of cases, said Mowbray, whose
clinic has treated 1,700 women, including 400 last year.
   In the United States, the treatment might help some 50,000
women, he said.
   Several centers in the United States and Sweden have also found
success in treating the immune system abnormality, other experts
said.
   Mowbray was interviewed by telephone this week before speaking
Thursday at a symposium near Portland, Maine, of the American
Society for the Immunology of Reproduction.
   About 1 percent of women who try to have a baby experience
recurring pregnancy loss, which means three or more consecutive
miscarriages, said symposium co-chairman Neal Rote, director of the
graduate immunology program at the University of Southern Maine in
Portland.
   He estimated that 40 percent to 50 percent of the women with
recurring pregnancy losses have some kind of immune system problem.
Of this group, maybe 75 percent have the problem that can be
treated by the blood cell injections, he said.
   The normal job of the immune system is to attack foreign
invaders, such as bacteria, that can cause disease. In response to
pregnancy, the immune system normally produces proteins that make
it ignore fetal cells called trophoblasts, which form tissue that
links the fetus to the mother.
   But in some women, the immune system fails to produce those
proteins. It attacks the trophoblasts, ending the pregnancy,
Mowbray said.
   Injections of the husband's white blood cells stimulate the
immune system to create the protective proteins, Mowbray said.
   In one test of the treatment, women who got such injections gave
birth about 80 percent of the time on their next try at pregnancy,
while women who got injections of their own cells for comparison
purposes showed less than half that rate, Mowbray said.
   The treatment normally requires only one injection, but some
women require a booster, he said.
   No evidence of side effects has appeared in the babies, he said.
   Mowbray said his success rate depends in part on carefully
excluding women with genetic or other problems that cannot be
helped by the treatment.
   The success rate probably cannot exceed 90 percent for the age
group his clinic treats, he said. With an average age of 37, about
10 percent of pregnancies will abort spontaneously anyway, he said.
   Carolyn Coulam, medical director of the Center for Reproduction
and Transplantation Immunology in Indianapolis, said Mowbray's
success rate is plausible.
   Other groups have reported rates of about 70 percent with a
variety of treatments, such as injecting blood cells from somebody
other than the husband or using vaginal suppositories with a
donor's seminal fluid from which sperm have been removed, she said.
   Her group uses the latter method with about 70 percent success,
she said.
   The immune system problem also is treated at the University of
Utah and at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, she said.
   She and Rote also said a national registry of children born
after immune-system therapy should be established to gather
information on the safety of the procedure.
   With an experimental treatment being offered to basically
healthy people, ``you've got to be very secure you're not causing
any harm,'' Rote said.

   China has purged 153,000 people from its
Communist Party over the past five years and disciplined another
656,000 as part of a drive to improve the quality of its members,
the government announced today.
   In addition, the party's Central Committee Organization
Department said the party last year accepted only one out of four
applicants for membership in the elite group which rules China.
   The party took in 2 million new members last year out of 8
million applicants, bringing total membership to 47.75 million, the
official Xinhua News Agency said. About 1 billion people live in
China.

Jack Lemmon and others who helped dedicate an art gallery in her
name.
   ``In making her name a permanent part of the AFI campus, the
trustees gratefully acknowledge her generosity to the film and

cultural emissary and exemplary friend and advocate of the
institution,'' AFI Director Jean Firstenberg said Thursday.
   The Bonita Granville Wrather Gallery, featuring film and
television-related art, is located on the first floor of the Warner
Communications Building on the AFI campus.
   Ms. Wrather, 65, was nominated at age 12 for an Academy Award
for her performance in the film ``These Three,'' starring Lillian
Hellman and William Wyler. She went on to appear in more than 55
films and television shows.

   Thirty thousand fans paid up to $125 each to
watch the most grandiose operatic production in Canadian history,
complete with elephants, tigers and a 14-foot python.
   It was Verdi's spectacular ``Aida,'' in a production first
staged last year next to the Sphinx at Giza, Egypt, where the opera
is set.
   Tenor Nicola Martinucci won an ovation for his ringing Radames,
but a five-second echo in Olympic Stadium affected the delicate
soprano of Katia Ricciarelli as Aida.
   A giant 46-foot Sphinx was the centerpiece on stage Thursday
night, constructed in the middle of the domed stadium's baseball
field, normally the home of the Montreal Expos.
   Giuseppe Raffa conducted a 120-piece orchestra and 140-member
chorus. The production will travel to Sydney, Australia, in
December, Tokyo in March and Vancouver in May.

<HEAD>Hungarian Party Chief Plans to Outline Reforms to Reagan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's new Communist Party chief hopes
President Reagan's new appreciation of Soviet glasnost will extend
to other East bloc countries as well, one of the Hungarian leader's
top aides says.
   Karoly Grosz, a reformist picked to his job at a dramatic party
conference last month, arrives here July 20 for the first U.S.
visit by a Hungarian leader in 42 years.
   Miklos Nemeth of the 11-member ruling Politburo said in an
interview Thursday that his boss hopes to outline to Reagan and to
the two presidential hopefuls his country's experiment in political
openness and ``market-oriented socialism.''
   Nemeth said the new party leader is primarily seeking to tell
Americans that his country has undertaken political as well as
economic reforms.
   Hungary, burdened with the highest per capita indebtedness in
Eastern Europe, undertook the reforms one year ago to reduce its
$18 billion debt and 18 percent annual inflation.
   Nemeth said the political changes adopted at the party
conference are still relatively unknown. These include increased
democracy and openness which will be manifested in much broader
parliamentary activity, he said.
   ``His visit provides a good opportunity to make this known here.
If we're able to succeed in this respect, then the visit will be a
success,'' said Nemeth, who was attending a conference of the U.S.
Information Agency here.
   Nemeth is the first Eastern European delegate to attend the
annual USIA forum of international opinion leaders.
   Grosz served as prime minister, the No. 2 job in his country,
until the conference which brought outspoken reformers such as
Nemeth into the ruling elite and ousted aging party leader Janos
Kadar, 76. Eight members of the Politburo were dropped in the
reshuffle.
   Nemeth said Grosz hopes to strengthen economic ties with the
United States. The Hungarian parliament is considering laws that
would liberalize foreign investment and permit more joint ventures
in Hungary, enabling more business with the United States, he said.
   ``We're beginning to build a market-oriented socialism,'' he
said. ``This has never happened in a socialist country. It is a new
experiment.''
   Asked whether Hungary wants other Eastern European countries to
adopt this system, Nemeth said, ``each government is responsible
for its own model'' although ``we would be very glad if other
countries learn from our experience as we study other countries'
experiences.''
   He said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's more flexible economic
policies are ``a very promising development.''
   Nemeth has meetings scheduled with Michel Camdessus, director of
the International Monetary Fund, and Barber Conable, the head of
the World Bank.
   Hungary owes some money to the IMF, but 40 percent of its debt
is to Japanese banks. Last year Hungary also received about $580
million from the West German Federal Bank.
   Nemeth said he had met for a roundtable discussion Wednesday
with State Department experts on Eastern Europe and described to
them his country's reforms.
   Nemeth, an economist, attended Harvard University for one year
on a visitors' program. He speaks English although he preferred to
use an interpreter during the interview, saying he was tired and
didn't want to make mistakes.

<HEAD>City, HUD Settle Public Housing Desegregation Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials reached an agreement Thursday with
federal housing officials to desegregate about 17,000 public
housing units in 69 developments operated by the Boston Housing
Authority.
   ``This agreement is designed to ensure fair and equal access for
public housing throughout Boston,'' said Mayor Raymond Flynn. ``It
is intended to keep decision-making at the local level and away
from a federal court.''
   The agreement between Flynn, the BHA and the federal department
of Housing and Urban Development follows an October 1987 HUD report
that found a pattern of keeping white housing projects white and
isolating blacks and other minorities in projects where their own
race predominated.
   The Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights, which is handling the
suit for the NAACP, contends some of the victims of discrimination
deserve monetary damages as well as immediate housing, said
attorney Alan Rom.
   ``However much may have been remedied by that plan, there's
still plenty left over,'' Rom said.
   The Flynn administration has been pressured by a lawsuit by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to stop
discriminatory housing practices.
   A key feature of the agreement is for the housing authority to
identify people who have been victims of discriminatory public
housing practices and put them near the top of the priority housing
list behind only emergency cases involving families on the verge of
homelessness.
   Anyone passed over because of race or national origin since Oct.
1, 1983, would be considered such a victim.
   Flynn emphasized that no current resident of public housing will
be forced to move as a result of the agreement.
   Boston's is the largest housing authority in the country to
enter into an agreement to voluntarily comply with fair public
housing practices, according to Robert LaPlante, HUD's regional
director for fair housing.
   ``This is a document that is as fair as it gets,'' said Doris
Bunte, administrator of the Boston Housing Authority.
   Once discrimination victims have been identified and placed in
housing, the city will invoke a new tenant placement system,
subject to later approval by HUD.
   Under the new system, the BHA would ask the roughly 13,500
applicants on the city waiting list to choose between a city-wide
list of available apartments or a site-specific development list.
   City-wide applicants would receive faster placement under the
new system. If HUD rejects that system, the BHA would have to use a
HUD-developed plan in which there an applicant could not specify a
housing development.

<HEAD>U.S. Agency Hired, Protected Nazi War Criminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army hired high-ranking Nazi secret
police officers, stormtroopers, propagandists and collaborators
after World War II and protected them behind an official cloak of
secrecy, according to a harshly critical Justice Department report.
   The report says U.S. military intelligence employed the Nazis to
provide information and monitor Soviet activity in occupied nations
after the war, protecting them from prosecution for war crimes
including torturing and murdering civilians.
   The report focuses at length on the U.S. Army's
Counter-Intelligence Corps' hiring of convicted Nazi war criminal
Robert Jan Verbelen, and its continued employment of him even after
he admitted having been a member of a Nazi security unit that was
declared a criminal organization.
   The Justice Department listed 13 individuals, in addition to
Verbelen, but did not identify any of the others by name. The
information was based on official documents and interviews with
former CIC agents, but the department said the information remains
classified under U.S. policies to protect the identity of
intelligence operatives.
   Prepared by the Criminal Division's Office of Special
Investigations, the 92-page report said Verbelen was paid by CIC
for 10 years, from 1946 to 1957, for intelligence work in Austria
even though he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for
the murders of 101 people in his native Belgium.
   The report said Verbelen, now 77 and living in Austria,
``manipulated the CIC into protecting him from being brought to
justice for his crimes.''
   ``He was able to accomplish this ... as a direct result of the
CIC's reliance upon former Nazi and Nazi collaborators in its
immediate postwar European operations,'' the report said.
   It said the CIC initially relied on the information Verbelen
gave about himself, including the name he gave, Peter Mayer. But in
1950, he informed the agency his name was really Herbert Schwab,
describing himself as a devoted Nazi Party member since the
mid-1930s and a member of a Nazi security unit that had been
declared a criminal organization, the report said.
   ``Despite this change in identity and life history, the (CIC)
made no attempt to verify the information Verbelen supplied about
himself, and it continued to employ him,'' the report said.
   Neal Sher, special investigations director who conducted the
study at the request of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
said the report already has been given to the Belgian and Austrian
governments.
   The report said the Army intelligence group discovered
Verbelen's true identity when the CIA asked for information about
him in 1956.
   Sher, at a news conference, declined to say how long the CIA had
known Verbelen's true identity or to give any other information
about CIA involvement with Verbelen.
   Sher said Justice Department investigators interviewed Verbelen
himself in the summer of 1985 and found him unrepentant. ``He
thinks he has nothing to be ashamed of,'' Sher said.
   He said the investigation was not related to any modern
intelligence-gathering efforts and was not meant to be judgmental.
But he said some conclusions ``cry out.''
   The report said the CIC followed a policy that ``the end
justifies the means.''
   ``It is difficult to understand why the CIC did not make a
greater effort to check those persons' backgrounds, particularly as
it had ready access to Nazi Party, SS, and German military files,''
the report said.
   ``The CIC's logic must also be questioned in its apparent
assumption that a fascist would be more loyal to a democratic
government than to a communist one,'' the report said.
   It said in Verbelen's case, it would have been impossible for
the agency to determine his value as an informant since it made no
effort to find out who he really was.
   Among the agents and informants hired by CIC in Austria,
according to the report, were:
   _A former Gestapo official sentenced to two years in prison for
high treason.
   _A pre-war fascist leader whom CIC protected from arrest even
though he had been accused of being deputy commander of a unit that
burned villages and murdered civilians.
   _The chief of security of an unidentified Nazi puppet state who
headed an arms plant that used slave labor.
   _A man accused of torturing several people, including two
priests.
   _Two former SS officers who are now believed to have
manufactured information so they could work as informants.
   _An Austrian police official who used his job to protect Nazis
from arrest.
   _A former SS and Gestapo officer who it was later found was
selling the same information to the British and French while all
the time being primarily loyal to the Soviets.
   Edward Dennis, head of the department's Criminal Division, said
the investigation was done as thoroughly as possible, ``regardless
of who that will embarrass or make uncomfortable.''

<HEAD>Haying Allowed In Set-Aside Land Because Of Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has opened up land
set aside under a massive federal conservation program so that
farmers may harvest hay in areas were livestock feed has been
shriveled by drought and hot weather.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Thursday that all of
North Dakota and parts of a dozen other drought-stricken states are
eligible for haying on land held by farmers in the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP.
   ``Haying will be allowed for a 30-day period in counties found
to be suffering from a severe drought that has adversely affected
forage crops,'' Lyng said. ``Livestock grazing of this acreage is
not authorized.''
   In addition to the counties approved for haying, Lyng said that
additional designations will be made county-by-county by the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Once counties are approved, interested producers who are
enrolled in CRP will be notified and may apply at county offices
within 10 days for permission to cut hay from their land, he said.
   Jerry Newcomb, head of the agency's emergency operations and
livestock programs, said farmers in the counties announced on
Thursday can begin applying for the haying program as soon as
county offices receive operating procedures in the next day or so.
   Newcomb said he had no estimates of how many acres are eligible
for haying in the designated counties.
   The CRP, was authorized in the 1985 farm law to take up to 45
million acres of highly erodible land from crop production for 10
years. The land must be planted to protective grass or trees. In
return, farmers get annual rental payments from the government,
currently averaging $45 to $50 per acre a year.
   Farmers in feed-short drought areas have been seeking permission
to harvest hay from the CRP land and also to graze livestock on it.
Lyng, however, said grazing was not approved.
   Participants in the program who opt to cut hay from CRP land
will have their next annual payments reduced 25 percent on the
acreage harvested.
   Emergency haying and grazing had already been approved in more
than 1,000 counties in 20 states for land taken from crop
production under annual commodity programs. That land involves
so-called ``acreage conservation reserve'' and ``conservation use''
land and is not included in the long-term CRP operation.
   According to USDA's announcement, further county eligibility for
haying priviliges on CRP land ``will be made based on the fact that
the country has been approved for the emergency haying and
grazing'' of land in the acreage conservation reserve and the
conservation use categories.
   Further, the agency said, a ``drought severity index'' reported
weekly by USDA and the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration will be use to determine a county's
haying eligibility.
   In addition to all of North Dakota's 53 counties, the following
counties were designated for CRP haying privileges:

<HEAD>Farm Senators Rip Into Goodies for Executives at Failed Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free cars and lavish office furnishings for
executives of the failed Federal Land Bank in Jackson, Miss., are
drawing sharp criticism from Farm Belt senators.
   ``If even a fraction of what we've heard about today is true,
some type of punitive action will have to be taken against those
who are responsible,'' said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., after a
report from regulators Thursday.
   They said 133 automobiles were found at the Jackson institution,
one of 12 land banks in the $50 billion Farm Credit System, a
network of borrower-owned cooperatives that together make up the
nation's largest farm lender.
   Forty other new cars were on order May 20 when the bank ran out
of operating capital, closed its doors and went into receivership,
they said. They said even newly hired lending officers were
authorized to use the autos for personal driving of up to 1,000
miles a month.
   A $60,000 bill arising from credit cards issued to bank
executives also was pending, according to the system's chief
regulator, Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration.
   Naylor stessed that no basis had been established to suggest
wrongdoing by anyone. He said his agency's investigators were
continuing their efforts to sort out the situation.
   He acknowledged that one former bank officical had been
permitted to take home some of his office furnishings. But he said
this was not uncommon in private industry in settlements between
companies and departing executives.
   Senators, however, were more critical.
   ``At a time when farmers are living on the edge of bankruptcy, I
find it appalling that the funds of farmer-borrowers were being
used to decorate the walls with Persian rugs and high-priced
paintings,'' Boren said.
   Boren himself said that oriental rugs and opulent art works and
furnishings had adorned a number of offices and that ``there are
some nails on the wall with nothing hanging on them now.''
   The report prompted Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., to call for an FBI
investigation.
   ``What we've heard here is utterly outrageous,'' Conrad said.
``What we've heard is going to shake confidence in the Farm Credit
System.''
   Boren stopped short of calling for an FBI probe but urged Naylor
to make initial contact with the FBI while continuing his own
investigation.
   Authorities say one reason several Farm Credit System banks got
into trouble is that they became locked into high-priced borrowing
themselves early in the 1980s before the farm economy went into the
doldrums.
   Competing institutions lowered interest rates. But Farm Credit
System banks could not follow suit because they were locked into
high credit costs.
   For that reason, their most creditworthy customers were lured
away while other loans increasingly became delinquent.

<HEAD>Measure Against Tinted Films Attached To Appropriations Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee is trying
to ride to the rescue of movie directors and others who resent what
Ted Turner has done to their black-and-white masterpieces by
``colorizing'' them.
   The committee's cavalry may be headed off at the pass, though,
by the powerful Rules Committee.
   The movie provision is contained in the $9.7 billion
appropriations bill for the Interior Department and related
agencies passed by the committee on Thursday. The committee on a
25-20 show of hands rejected an amendment that would have deleted
it.
   The bill would create a nine-member commission to decide what
movies are artistically significant.
   A black-and-white movie so chosen could not be shown or
distributed under its original title if it had been colored like
``The Maltese Falcon'' and others recently on television from
Turner's vast film library.
   In a provision that could affect the television practice of
chopping movies to fit arbitrary time intervals with breaks for
commercials, the bill would require that any chosen movie,
black-and-white or color, would have to carry notice if it had been
significantly changed over the objections of the director or
principal writer. If those figures were dead, the commission could
require a notice that it had been changed if it believed the
director or writer would object if alive.
   The Rules Committee can deflect the action by denying a waiver
of the House rule that bills appropriating money should not contain
substantive legislation. If the waiver is denied, any member on the
floor can raise a point of order to delete the offending section.
   The Rules chairman, Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., wrote the
Appropriations Committee to object to its consideration of the
issue instead of the Judiciary Committee, where a similar bill has
been languishing.
   Great art is being desecrated, argued the principal backer of
the provision, Rep. Robert L. Mrazek, D-N.Y. Referring to the 1946
classic about returning war veterans, ``The Best Years of Our
Lives,'' Mrazek said, ``I would rather watch the scene where
Frederic March returns to his family than a roomful of Renoirs.''
   He read a telegram from director Frank Capra that complained the
current owners of his 1940s film starring Jimmy Stewart, ``It's a
Wonderful Life,'' had ``splashed it all over with Easter egg colors
and ruined it.''
   ``Obviously this is not going to survive the Rules Committee,''
said Mrazek. ``But if it survives this Appropriations Committee, it
will send a signal.''
   Stewart was present for the debate, and Rep. Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla., used Stewart's noted performances as a reforming senator
in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' to argue against considering
the measure: ``Mr. Smith would have stood up in this committee
against the bypassing of committee procedures.''
   The leader of the opponents in the appropriations committee,
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., argued, ``This is a serious intrusion on
copyright law we ought to leave to Mr. (Robert) Kastenmeier and his
subcommittee.'' Kastenmeier, D-Wis., is chairman of Judiciary's
copyrights subcommittee, and plans hearings soon, Fazio said.
   Even so, he continued, the provision is deeply flawed since
``performers, photographers, studio owners are all left out,'' and
the issue belongs in labor-management negotiations between
directors and producers.
   ``I find it offensive for a government body to designate what is
art,'' Fazio said.
   Stewart said the coversion of black-and-white movies to color
``is really a terrible practice and something that should be
outlawed.''
   Congress, he said ``by legislation and so on, is going to
recognize the motion picture as an art form more than it has done
before. ... This is the thing that we won in this first tryout,
which I think is very important.''
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said he was pleased that the vote was so close, and
claimed there was ``a big swing in my direction'' as members
studied the issue. He said he believed the opposition of the
appropriations committee chairman, Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.,
would be influential in derailing the measure on the floor.

<HEAD>US Hopes To Renew Funding For Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is preparing to
sound out members of Congress on renewing U.S. aid to the Contra
rebels as a result of the collapsed peace talks in Nicaragua,
according to a U.S. official and an insurgent leader.
   Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra directorate, said Thursday
the administration will begin consultations with the Congress
``very soon'' on a new assistance package.
   No decision has been made on requesting military aid as part of
a package because it is not clear whether Congress would go along,
Cesar said. On Feb. 3, the House defeated by eight votes an aid
request that included $3.5 million for military equipment.
   An administration official, insisting on anonymity, confirmed
Cesar's account, saying a decision has been made to seek renewed
funding for the Contras but the details ``are completely up in the
air.''
   Cesar said: ``What that package will contain, the amount, it's
still open to discussions up here in Washington.
   ``There is no fixed date (for a vote) but it's going to be soon,
very soon and active discussions of that will start next week.''
   He said he wants any aid package to last until next February or
March to insulate the Contra issue from the emotions of the fall
presidential election campaign.
   Cesar made it clear the rebels want a renewal of military aid
because the Sandinista government, he said, has been receiving an
average of $40 million a month worth of lethal equipment from the
Soviet Union since Jan. 1.
   This has put the rebels at a severe disadvantage in peace
negotiations with the Sandinistas, he said. At the same time, he
added, the rebels ``do not want to restart the war'' and plan to
ask Central American governments to bring diplomatic pressure to
bear on the Sandinistas to support a peaceful settlement.
   Cesar spoke to reporters after he and his colleagues met with
Vice President George Bush, National Security advisor Colin Powell
and Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. The rebel
delegation met with members of Congress on Wednesday.
   The decision on whether to include military aid as part of a
package apparently will hinge on the administration's ability to
persuade Congress that the Sandinistas are to blame for the failure
last week of peace talks in Managua.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Tuesday the talks made
plain the Sandinistas' unwillingness to fulfill their stated
commitment to create democracy in Nicaragua.
   But Sandinista officials have said that the Contras sabotaged
the talks by introducing demands which were both new and ``absurd''
during the final hours of the negotiations last Thursday.
   As part of an interim cease-fire agreement signed by the Contras
and the Sandinistas last March 23, the rebels are entitled to
receive food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies from outside
sources.
   Congress approved $17 million in such aid a week later,
desginating that the money be obligated by Sept. 30. Outside
military aid to the rebels was barred under the agreement.
   When the humanitarian aid measure was approved by the House,
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, promised not to stand in the way of
any subsequent military aid proposal if the Sandinista-Contra peace
talks collapse.
   But Wright has indicated that he no longer feels bound by that
pledge because of a Republican proposal on May 26 to allow the CIA
to use contingency funds in support of the Contras. That bid was
rejected 214-190.
   On Tuesday, Wright said he would oppose any new military aid
request. But Cesar said he has the impression that congressional
sentiment has been shifting in support of the rebels since the
breakdown of the peace talks.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Reagan Will Veto Notification Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will veto any bill requiring
him to notify Congress within 48 hours of the start of a covert
operation, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told a House
committee considering such legislation.
   Carlucci told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday he
believes that if Reagan is compelled to reject such a measure, the
resulting constitutional confrontation between the White House and
Congress would cause a harmful and long-lasting lack of trust
between the two branches.
   But several House members said they believe presidents must be
held to a some standard of notification to prevent abuses of the
kind exposed by the Iran-Contra affair.
   Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine., co-chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, testified that he and his colleagues have
concluded ``that either you establish a time certain _ 48 hours or
whatever _ or it ends up being a matter of presidential
discretion.''
   ``There really is no middle ground,'' Cohen said.
   Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said that while he views
requiring a notice of covert operations within 48 hours as ``a
rather modest proposal,'' there are those in the administration
``who think it's deadly.''
   Carlucci said he has ``no doubt'' Reagan will veto the bill if
it reaches his desk in its present form.
   ``I respectfully urge the members to reflect on the wisdom of
the president's position and, beyond this, to consider the effect
of provoking a presidential veto on legislation governing the
entire realm of intelligence activities,'' Carlucci said.
   ``If trust, candor and accountability are the remedy to the
problems that brought about the Iran-Contra affair,'' he said,
``...the Congress risks undermining all of these goals and
reintroducing again an unhealthy adversarial basis to the oversight
process for years to come.
   ``I can think of no step by the Congress which would do more
harm to the process of rebuilding an atmosphere of trust and candor
between the branches.''
   The defense secretary said Reagan believes holding him to a
strict notification timetable would undermine his constitutional
authority as commander in chief and deprive him of essential
flexibility.
   He noted that the Canadian government offered its help in 1980
to spirit six American diplomats out of Iran only on condition that
Congress not be told.
   Had a 48-hour notification law been in effect, he said, the
White House would have had no choice but to reject the Canadian
offer to free Americans in peril.

   When Melvyn R. Paisley resigned from his Navy
job in April 1987 and set up shop in downtown Washington as a
consultant, he didn't have to wait long before some of the nation's
largest defense contractors were lining up to hire him.
   Paisley was selling information, a commodity much in demand
among the various companies seeking any edge they could get in the
high-stakes world of selling multimillion-dollar weapons to the
Pentagon.
   Paisley has become a major target in the nationwide
investigation of possible corruption involving contractors and
defense officials.
   Paisley, 63, has also been a key player in President Reagan's
naval build-up which was at the heart of the record defense splurge
during the president's first term in office.
   When Reagan took office in January, 1981, he moved to keep his
campaign pledge to ``re-arm America'' and his new Navy secretary,
John Lehman, was a major figure. Lehman led the fight for large
increases in the Navy budget, seeking the goal of a 600-ship Navy.
   Lehman also hired Paisley away from the Boeing Co. to become
assistant Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems.
Paisley, a native of Portland, Ore., had worked at Boeing for 28
years and held a number of top-level management positions. Before
taking the Navy job, he retired as manager of international
operations for Boeing's Space and Information Division.
   Paisley's appointment was controversial. His final payment from
Boeing was $183,000 and critics said there was an inherent conflict
of interest because Boeing is a Navy supplier.
   In July 1986, the Justice Department sued Paisley and four other
top Boeing officials, arguing that their severance payments created
a conflict of interest.
   On Feb. 17, 1987, two months before Paisley left office, U.S.
District Court Judge Claude Hilton of Alexandria, Va., ruled for
Paisley and the other four defendants. Paisley's comment was ``it's
a relief after five years of this problem ... to get rid of it.''
   But the case isn't over. Hilton's decision was overturned by the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., which declared
that the Boeing payments ``created the appearance of conflict of
interest.'' Paisley and the other defendants are seeking to have
the decision reconsidered.
   While he was at the Pentagon, Paisley joined forces with his
boss, Lehman, and Everett Pyatt, assistant Navy secretary for
shipbuilding. The trio fought hard, both inside and outside the
Navy, to preserve Reagan's build-up of ships.
   Paisley was known outside the Pentagon as a raconteur, but was a
stern taskmaster inside the building. ``He didn't like to be
opposed and when he was, he and Lehman didn't let many people get
in their way,'' said one official Thursday, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Paisley's departure from the Pentagon also raised questions,
according to former Navy Secretary James H. Webb Jr. Webb said
Thursday that when he became Navy secretary in April 1987, he
learned that Paisley had just persuaded Navy officials to give him
an unusual consulting contract with the research office he was
leaving.
   The contract also allowed Paisley to maintain his security
clearance for information on the military's most secret ``black
programs,'' Webb told The Washington Post.
   Webb said he canceled the contract before any money on it was
paid to Paisley.
   Paisley was also involved in the March 1986 decision by Raytheon
Corp. to fire former Pentagon official Lawrence Korb from his
Washington job with the company, after Korb suggested in a speech
that defense spending could be reduced.
   Korb had been assistant defense secretary for manpower issues
until leaving to join Raytheon in 1985.
   After the speech, Lehman, Pyatt and Paisley all complained about
Korb's statements and Raytheon officials admitted that Paisley had
asked the company to tell Korb not to speak out against the
Pentagon budget.
   The action was criticized in Congress, and a review by the
Pentagon inspector general's office concluded that although the
trio had acted improperly, there was no evidence to suggest they
had asked that Korb be dismissed.

   A search warrant in a military purchasing
fraud and bribery probe says McDonnell Douglas Corp. received
confidential information from the Pentagon in a $35 billion fighter
aircraft manufacturing competition won by the St. Louis company.
   The search warrant released this week says former Pentagon
official Melvyn Paisley, now a McDonnell Douglas consultant, passed
along to the company information relating to the Advanced Tactical
Aircraft program, including data about final offers.
   The warrant sought documents in the office of McDonnell Douglas'
marketing vice president, Thomas Gunn, concerning ``the Advanced
Tactical Aircraft program and Paisley's efforts to steer it
towards'' the company. The warrant said Paisley had provided the
company with ``information relating to the Advanced Tactical
Aircraft program, including BAFO information.'' BAFO stands for
best and final offers.
   McDonnell Douglas, which teamed up with General Dynamics Corp.,
won the competition last December for the design and construction
of the ATA, a new attack jet for the 21st century.
   The companies beat out another finalist team including the
Grumman Corp., Northrop Corp. and LTV Corp. to build the plane.
   The search warrant said Paisley gave McDonnell Douglas
information on a number of projects that was classified or
confidential or not otherwise available to other contractors:
   The other information concerned:
   _The proposed sale of McDonnell Douglas' F-18 fighter airplane
to the Swiss government and inside information pertaining to the
proposal of a competitor, General Dynamics Corp.'s, to sell its
fighter, the F-16, to the Swiss government.
   _A plan to develop an updated F-18, the FA-18, with the French
government, including an internal Navy study.
   _The sale of F-18's to the European fighter aircraft nations,
which are Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
   _The APG-65 made by Hughes Aircraft, the search and tracking
radar system for the FA-18.
   _A 1987 Center for Naval Analysis study regarding the 500 MG
Helicopter, known as the Killer Egg, and the future helicopter
needs of the Marine Corps. McDonnell Douglas manufactures the
helicopter.
   A former employee of McDonnell Douglas' Washington office
alleged in a lawsuit filed earlier this year that he had been
demoted and forced to retire because he tried to blow the whistle
on ``illegal activities'' by other employees involved with the
Defense Department, according to a report in today's Washington
Post.
   The lawsuit was filed by John R. Betzler, a 22-year McDonnell
Douglas employee, who was the company's director of military
aircraft marketing. Company officials denied during the trial that
any illegal activities had occurred.
   In March, the Post said, an Arlington Circuit Court jury awarded
Betzler $250,000. He had sought $7 million.

<TEXT>
   Roving groups of English soccer
fans, some singing ``God Save the Queen,'' overturned a car,
smashed windows and furniture in bars and fought with German pub
patrons early Friday, police said.
   On Thursday, the British government proposed barring England's
national team from the World Cup, the Olympics and other
international events in a five-part crackdown on soccer hooliganism.
   Several people were slightly injured in the violence in
Frankfurt's ``Apple Wine'' district and near the city's main train
station, police said.
   Seven Britons were arrested out of about 60 troublemakers, they
said.
   More than 100 English soccer fans have been arrested in clashes
during the European Soccer Championships, which West Germany is
hosting.
   British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd unveiled the proposals after
a 75-minute ``soccer summit'' at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
10 Downing Street home.
   ``We were all appalled by what has happened in Germany,'' Hurd
said. ``We were clear that present arrangements are not enough and
have got to be strengthened.''
   Hurd also proposed travel restrictions on fans involved in
violence, tighter controls over who gets into matches, tougher
licensing laws outside soccer stadiums to cut down on fans getting
drunk before and after matches and stepped-up police surveillance.
   England's Football Association, reacting to the wave of
violence, on Thursday withdrew its application for readmission to
European club soccer tournaments next season.
   English clubs were banned from competing in Europe after 39
people were killed in May 1985 in a rampage by Liverpool fans
through Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. Most of the victims
were fans of Juventus, from Turin, Italy.
   A state official said Thursday that West Germans, and not
English fans, were the initiators of violence Tuesday and Wednesday
in Duesseldorf, in which 371 people were arrested, 18 of them
English fans and most of the others West Germans. Most were
released after a few hours in jail.
   ``These (West German) hooligans were not soccer fans, but just
thugs who could not stomach the thought that English fans had a
reputation for being more brutal than themselves,'' said the
official, Herbert Schnoor, interior minister of the North-Rhine
Westphalia state, in a radio interview.
   ``There is no nation that can afford to have a policeman
stationed right next to every thug'' at soccer games, Schnoor said.
His ministry said the special police deployment at the game cost
about $900,000.
   About 22,000 Dutch and 8,500 English fans jammed into
Duesseldorf for the Wednesday night match, in which the Netherlands
defeated England 3-1.
   Federal border police, meanwhile, said they had seized hundreds
of truncheons, knives, whips, chains, baseball bats, fireworks and
other potential weapons from fans entering West Germany for the
championship series.

   Stressing the prosecution's ``good faith'' in
safeguarding the rights of Oliver L. North and three co-defendants,
a federal judge says it's time for the Iran-Contra cases to go to
trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Thursday cleared the
way for the four separate trials he has ordered by rejecting
defendants' claims that prosecutors violated their constitutional
rights.
   Gesell still must rule on defense motions that unprecedented
volumes of classified material will make trials impossible. But his
ruling left virtually no doubt that he plans to proceed.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has chosen North, the
fired National Security Council staffer who directed the
Iran-Contra affair, to be tried first. Gesell is expected to set a
trial date in the next few weeks.
   ``We are, of course, pleased with Judge Gesell's ruling,'' Walsh
said. ``We are prepared to go forward as directed by the court.''
   Thursday's ruling centered on defense contentions that Walsh
built his case on testimony given to Congress by three of the
defendants under grants of limited immunity from prosecution.
   Congress grants the immunity in order to compel testimony of
reluctant witnesses _ in this case, North, former National Security
Adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim. The fourth
defendant, businessman Richard V. Secord, testified without
immunity.
   As a tradeoff for the immunity, the prosecution in a criminal
case is barred from using the compelled testimony, except to show
perjury. The defense claimed that Walsh violated the immunity law
by building his case from the immunized testimony.
   Gesell rejected the claim, and praised Walsh for taking
extraordinary measures to make sure the prosecution staff, grand
jury witnesses, and grand jurors were not exposed to the immunized
testimony.
   ``Nothing has developed in the court's preliminary inquiry ...
which suggests the defendants who received use immunity have had
their Fifth Amendment rights impaired in a manner that
significantly affects their right to a fair trial,'' Gesell ruled.
   ``The good faith of independent counsel cannot be questioned on
this record,'' Gesell said, adding, he was left with ``no doubt''
that Walsh followed ``a vigorous program aimed at minimizing the
exposure of himself and his prosecutorial staffs to immunized
testimony.''
   ``Given these factual circumstances, it is not difficult to
reach a preliminary decision that the case should proceed to
trial.''
   The defendants sought to have the case dismissed, or,
alternatively, a full-blown pre-trial hearing on the issue. Gesell
said the tainted testimony question could be pursued after the
Iran-Contra trials are over.
   Gesell had ordered separate trials for the four defendants
several weeks ago, to preserve a defendant's usual trial privilege
of cross-examining other defendants. This would allow the
defendants to use each other's immunized testimony.
   The defendants are charged with a broad conspiracy to carry out
a secret operation of aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such
assistance was banned by law. To do so, the grand jury charged,
they illegally used profits from arms sales to Iran authorized by
President Reagan. Some of those profits also went for personal
gain, the indictment said.
   According to Gesell, there was ``ample probable cause'' for each
count of the indictment.
   He said ``the great bulk of the evidence was clearly known'' to
Walsh before any defendant received immunity. Ironically, he said,
much of Walsh's independent evidence came from Secord, who ``went
into extraordinarily comprehensive detail'' about the case, and
provided prosecutors ``with valuable leads and other background
information for its case.''
   Gesell said the grand jurors were so keenly aware of the tainted
evidence problem that the foreman had told prosecutors jurors would
walk out of the room if immunized testimony were presented.
   Walsh has admitted in pre-trial hearings that at times he and
his staff became inadvertently exposed to media coverage of the
testimony. All such incidents were reported to one of his staffers,
whose only role was to keep a log of the 75 incidents. Only two or
three had ``any semblance of meaningful significance,'' the judge
found.
   Gesell said defendants, ``in their zeal,'' believed ``even the
tiniest exposure to a witness or grand juror constituted exposure
to an incurable disease. Such is clearly not the case. Exposure to
a fleeting snippet means nothing.''

<HEAD>Plan To Require Altitude-Tracking Gear For Small Planes Scaled
Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a storm of protests from private pilots
and some members of Congress, the government has scaled back its
proposed requirement for small planes to be equipped with
altitude-tracking equipment.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it would
require small private planes to have altitude-encoding transponders
if they fly near 138 airports and in some cases as far as 30 miles
from the runway. The devices provide air traffic controllers with
altitude information about a specific plane on their radar screen.
   Only four months ago, the FAA said it was considering
regulations that would ban small planes from all airspace within 40
miles of 254 airports and above 6,000 feet when not flying near an
airport.
   The regulation announced Thursday requires the devices on small
planes within 30 miles of 27 of the nation's busiest airports after
July 1989 and within currently restricted airspace _ less than 10
miles in some many cases _ surrounding 109 other airports after
1990.
   Under the rule, small planes would be allowed to fly up to
10,000 feet without the equipment, instead of the 6,000 feet
suggested earlier. Currently the altitude-encoding transponders are
required above 12,500 feet.
   The final rule falls short of what the airlines and commercial
pilots had wanted but was seen as a significant victory for private
pilots and their powerful lobbying group, the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association.
   The February proposal had unleashed a firestorm among the
nation's private pilots, who flooded the FAA and congressional
offices with more than 80,000 complaint letters. Several
congressmen had threatened legislation forcing the FAA to back off.
   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association called the
restrictions an ``overzealous'' reaction to concern about aerial
collisions and urged private plane owners across the country to
``join ... in opposing the great airspace grab.''
   Only last year Congress directed the FAA to expand the use of
the altitude-encoding equipment, known as Mode-C transponders, in
small planes because of an increasing number of near-collision
reports and the 1986 collision of a small plane and a Mexican
airliner over Cerritos, Calif.
   The airlines and commercial pilots have call for stricter rules
for the use of the altitude-encoding equipment on small planes and
favor such equipment on any plane flying in airspace used by
commercial jetliners.
   While the final rule is far less than what the agency suggested
last February, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said Thursday
evening he expects the new requirements to signficantly reduce the
danger from aerial collisions.
   Under the new requirements, small planes must be equip with
transponders that tell controllers the plane's altitude by July 1,
1989, or be banned from airspace within 30 miles of the 27 airports
that are surrounded by so-called Terminal Control Areas, or TCAs.
Any aircraft flying within the TCA's already must have the devices.
   By the end of 1990 aircraft flying in restricted airspace known
as Airport Radar Service Areas, or ARSAs, must have the equipment.
The ARSAs vary in size but generally are much smaller than the
airspace envisioned by the February proposal.
   The FAA also said certain ``designated'' airports that have
commecial air traffic but no currently restricted airspace would
not be opened for small planes without Mode-C transponders after
1990. So far only two such airports have been designated _
Billings, Mont., and Fargo, N.D. _ but agency spokesman Fred Farrar
said others may be added.
   The airlines have argued that any aircraft that flies in the
vicinity of commercial air traffic should be equipped with the
altitude encoding transponder so a controller more easily can
determine if two planes are on a collision course.
   The private pilots, led buy AOPA, maintained that the sweeping
restrictions proposed by the FAA in February amounted to an
unnecessary infringment on many pilots. The small plane pilots also
complained about the estimated $600 to $2,000 cost for the
altitude-encoding equipment.

   Jesse Jackson says it's fine that the
Democrats shower him with praise for his contributions to the
party, but he expects something more than accolades in return.
   He met with a roomful of Democratic senators on Thursday in
search of what he considers his fair share of so-called super
delegates for the party's convention this summer.
   But only Sen. Ernest Hollings, from Jackson's home state of
South Carolina, stood by him with a pledge to support his
presidential candidacy at the convention.
   Hollings said he would do so even though Michael Dukakis is now
the ``obvious winner'' of the party's nomination because of his
delegate majority.
   Jackson contends party leaders should support him because he has
helped them by working on voter registration, and believes he is
due a substantial share of super delegates because he came in
second in the primary contests. The super delegates are Democrats
who become delegates because of their elected or party leadership
positions.
   But Jackson emerged from the meeting with some 30 senators to
tell reporters that ``Only Sen. Hollings among the senators has
endorsed me. No Democratic state chair has, except Washington D.C.''
   Jackson was making campaign appearances today in Texas.
   He indicated Thursday he is weary of getting only verbal strokes
from the party but no delegate support.
   The ``basic party leadership while accepting my investment in
the party to make it strong has not been as reciprocal as it ought
to be,'' Jackson said.
   ``If in fact I have invested nothing in the party, I should
expect no return. If I invest, I should reasonably expect return.
   ``So I appreciate the accolades that I am the voter registration
champion for the party, that I have led the drive to return the
Senate back to the Democrats, that I have won states that no one
said I could win.
   ``If I have done all of that, then I simply say let's be fair,''
Jackson said.
   Hollings said he was urging other super delegates whose
districts or states Jackson won to follow the senator's lead ``for
the good of the party.''
   ``Coming from my home state, he won my home state, he certainly
has earned my vote'' at the convention, Hollings said.
   One senator who attended the meeting, Sen. Bob Graham of
Florida, later said he did not intend his endorsement of Dukakis to
be ``a negative reflection on Rev. Jackson'' but he saw no reason
to change any rules so that Jackson could get more delegates.
   Jackson contends his share of the super delegate total should
more closely reflect his 29 percent of the popular vote.
   As of Thursday, he had 52 of the 643 super delegates while
Dukakis had 350, according to The Associated Press tally.
   Hollings said Jackson has run ``a winning campaign'' this year
in contrast to his 1984 race when he ``frightened the bejesus'' out
of people.
   This time Jackson has not frightened anyone, Hollings said.
   ``He's charmed them in all of those different debates and in his
own right has leveled off,'' said the senator, who also sought the
presidency in 1984.
   Jackson was praised earlier Thursday by members of the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee. Committee Chairman Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and other senators thanked Jackson for his years
as an outspoken leader against drugs and for his work with young
people.
   Jackson told the committee that U.S. military forces should not
be used as the primary drug interdiction force, but rather should
be used for backing up other agencies and providing intelligence.
   ``We must be careful, however, to avoid involving the military
in any police actions against citizens or arrests,'' he said. ``We
should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other
aspect of foreign policy.''
   Later Kennedy joined Jackson at a rally outside the Capitol
denouncing South Africa as a terrorist state. Jackson urged support
for anti-apartheid legislation.

<HEAD>President Praises Army For Accepting Civilian Supremacy Over
Military</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat
congratulated the army for pledging allegiance to his government
after he apparently defused his first major power struggle with
military leaders.
   ``We are in a period of democratic apprenticeship'' and
``adjustment to a framework of civilian supremacy and
constitutional principle,'' Manigat said Thursday in a regularly
scheduled press conference.
   The president said he met for four hours Wednesday with members
of the army general staff before they issued a statement
recognizing his authority and pledging loyalty to the government.
   ``The civil power and military institution have given together .
.. a lesson in patriotism and democracy which permits us to be
optimistic,'' he said. ``I pay homage to the military for having
done their duty.''
   Manigat overruled his top army commander Wednesday by rescinding
an order transferring and retiring high-ranking officers, including
Col. Jean-Claude Paul, indicted on drug trafficking charges this
year by a grand jury in Miami.
   ``It is not a question of individuals; it is a question of
principle ... the eminently democratic principle of supremacy of
the civilian authority over the military,'' Manigat said when asked
if his decision amounted to a personal defense of Paul.
   Manigat, widely alleged to be the army's candidate in junta-run
elections last January, maintains that he rules independently from
the army.
   His decision Wednesday to rescind an order from Army
Commander-in-Chief Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy resulted in the first
crisis between Haiti's new civilian government and the military,
which has traditionally held power in this impoverished Caribbean
nation.
   Namphy had ordered Paul transferred from commander of the
700-man Dessalines Barracks, the most feared army unit in Haiti, to
assistant chief of staff, a largely administrative post. Paul
reportedly refused to accept the transfer.
   It was unclear why Namphy ordered the transfer, whether the
order signified a power struggle within the army or whether the
transfer was linked to charges of drug-running against Paul, who
has denied the charges.
   ``There is absolutely no split in the armed forces, none at
all,'' Col. Gary Leon, general secretary of the army general staff,
said in a telephone interview.
   Soldiers under Paul's command have been blamed for widespread
violence against voters that forced the cancellation of last
November's independently adminstrated general elections and left
more than 30 people dead.
   Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Carl Nicolas denied earlier this year
that Paul was involved in drug trafficking and accused the foreign
press of singling out the 49-year-old colonel for attack.
   By rescinding Namphy's order, Manigat, the nominal
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, appeared to have sided with
Paul.
   ``The president simply said that government authority is
essentially civilian, and passed instructions to the army to
rectify certain decisions,'' said Louis Noisin, president of the
Senate. ``From a parliamentary point of view, the problem is
resolved. Now it's up to the army to do its internal house
cleaning.''
   Namphy was president of the junta that ruled Haiti from the time
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in 1986 until Manigat took
office in February.
   Namphy and his general staff backed down Wednesday by issuing
what appeared to be a face-saving statement ``tentatively''
accepting Manigat's decision and pledging loyalty to the government.
   But it remained unclear how long the military will continue to
tolerate Manigat's interventions in military decisions.
   ``Everyone fears a standoff between the Dessalines Batallion and
other sectors of the army,'' Gregoire Eugene, leader of the Haitian
Social Christian Party, said in an interview.
   ``It is true that if Paul had been promoted to assistant chief
of staff, as is reported, he would have lost control over his
troops. The Dessalines Barracks is traditionally a key factor in
power plays,'' said Eugene, once a presidential candidate.
   When asked if the army accepts Manigat's authority as the the
nominal head of the armed forces, Leon said: ``Yes. It's written in
the constitution.''

<HEAD>Broadcasters Group Complains About Plan To Beam American TV To
Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broadcasters trade group says a Senate
proposal to beam American television programs to Cuba has become a
``political deal'' that is ignoring the concerns of American radio
and TV stations.
   The National Association of Broadcasters charges that TV Marti
advocates are trying to squelch their concerns that the proposed
government TV version of Radio Marti could interfere with U.S.
broadcasts.
   NAB officials said they were denied copies of engineering
studies on the proposed TV Marti before the Senate Appropriations
Committee voted Thursday on a spending bill that earmarks $7.5
million for the service in the 1989-90 budget of the U.S.
Information Agency.
   ``It's a political deal,'' NAB lobbyist James May said of the
committee's action on the proposal to transmit American news and
entertainment programs to Cuba from a blimp over the Florida Keys.
   The budget bill goes next to the full Senate.
   May said the NAB was rebuffed by the staff of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee that approved the TV Marti
appropriation last week and by Stewart Sweet, who is lobbying on
behalf of TV Marti advocates.
   Sweet's Washington firm of Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly has
links to the Republican presidential campaign of Vice President
George Bush. Charles Black, a principal of the firm, is an adviser
to the campaign.
   Bush has been a vocal supporter of TV Marti and has backed the
proposal in speeches aimed at gaining votes from the Cuban-American
community of southern Florida.
   But TV Marti is also being pushed by Democratic Sen. Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, the Appropriations subcommittee
chairman.
   May said Sweet refused to give copies of the feasibility studies
to NAB officials because of ``national security concerns.''
   Sweet declined to comment, and when asked about his interest in
the matter said, ``I just happen to think that TV Marti is a good
idea. Let's just leave it at that.''
   Warren Kane, a Hollings staffer on the Appropriations
subcommittee, said none of the reports is classified. He said he
gave NAB on Wednesday two of six feasibility studies on the
proposal and told an NAB lobbyist he could read the other four,
including the engineering analyses, in the subcommittee's office.
   May acknowledged the offer was made but said Kane refused to
allow the NAB representative to copy the report so he could show it
to NAB engineers.
   ``This is a cover for a very disturbing process,'' May said.
   The feasibility studies were done by the Radio Marti advisory
board, headed by Jorge Mas Canosa, who also chairs the Cuban
American National Foundation. A secretary in Mas' Miami office said
he was not in Thursday afternoon and he did not return the call
seeking comment.
   May said the NAB is concerned about interference to American TV
stations in South Florida from the TV Marti signal as well as to
American AM radio stations from Cuban retaliatory jamming. Cuban
transmitters can blast a signal that would interfere with stations
in 30 states, May said.
   In addition, the TV Marti signal could be jammed easily by the
Cubans, preventing the signal from being viewed where it is
intended, he said.
   The Senate proposal includes no money to compensate U.S.
stations that are harmed by Cuban retaliation, as did the
legislation that created Radio Marti, which began broadcasting in
May 1985.

<HEAD>Researchers Discouraged About Prospects for AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All of the experimental AIDS vaccines
tested so far have failed to protect chimpanzees from the lethal
virus, and these rare animals should no longer be used for vaccine
studies, a researcher says.
   Dr. Reinhard Kurth of the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Frankfurt,
West Germany said that 120 chimps around the world have been
innoculated with potential vaccines and then given the AIDS virus.
In no case did the various approaches protect the animals from
infection.
   Kurth said the research world's supply of chimps is rapidly
being used up. They and gibbon apes are the only animals that can
be infected with HIV, the virus responsible for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, and both are endangered species.
   ``We should forget about chimps for now and save them for a
stage when we know a lot more about vaccines,'' he said.
   Kurth's conclusion Thursday was one of several generally
pessimistic reports about vaccine development at the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS.
   Although most researchers said they believe a vaccine will
ultimately be made, it could take several years to design one that
outsmarts the crafty defenses of HIV.
   ``Yes, it's possible, but it's going to take a long time. There
are no easy answers,'' said Dr. Linda Gritz.
   Gritz is a molecular biologist at Applied Biotechnology in
Cambridge, Mass., one of about a dozen U.S. companies that are
attempting to create an AIDS vaccine. Such a project, she said,
could take 10 years.
   ``I think we are some way yet from making a vaccine that will
protect against HIV,'' agreed Dr. Gordon Ada of the World Health
Organization.
   He said it's clear that vaccine development will be far more
difficult for AIDS than for other diseases that have been tamed
with vaccines.
   The AIDS virus attacks the immune system, the blood cells that
ordinarily protect the body from microbes.
   Ordinarily, the body defeats germs in two main ways. Blood cells
called B cells make antibodies that latch onto the germs, marking
them for destruction. Another variety called cytotoxic T cells
directly attack the virus and the cells that the microbe has
infected.
   Ada said that among the defense strategies that make HIV such a
powerful foe:
   _The virus mutates quickly, constantly changing its outer coat.
Antibodies that recognize one version of the virus fail to spot
another another.
   _The virus may ride into the body inside infected blood cells.
These cells are not recognized by antibodies as enemies.
   _Once established, the virus may hide in cells in the brain and
other parts of the body where they are shielded from attack by
cytotoxic T cells.
   Ada said that attempts to get around these difficulties have
failed, and more basic research into the intricacies of infection
will be necessary before scientists can logically plan a vaccine.
   ``I am certainly optimistic we can do something, but we have to
establish what happens in the first two or three weeks after
infection,'' he said. ``Where does the virus go? The more types of
cells that are infect, the more difficult it is going to be.''
   But some researchers are already experimenting with vaccines in
people, even though there is no clear evidence that they will
ultimately work.
   Dr. Jonas Salk, pioneer of the polio vaccine, announced at the
meeting that he is giving a vaccine made from killed AIDS virus to
men who are infected but still healthy. The aim is to try to beef
up their immune defenses so they don't get sick.
   Using an elaborate system of vaccine and booster shots, Dr.
Daniel Zagury of the University of Paris says he has produced
powerful AIDS antibodies in experiments on himself. However, no one
knows if this would be enough to protect him from infection.
   At the Critical Care Medicine Department of the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., Dr. Joseph Kovacs and others
are giving an AIDS virus protein to healthy people.
   So far, this approach has produced signs of a weak response from
their immune systems, and the researchers hope that higher doses
will trigger more powerful levels of AIDS defenses.
   Nobody can say for sure whether this or some other approach will
work, said Kovacks. ``But if we don't try to develop a vaccine, we
will never get one.''
   In other reports at the meeting:
   _Dr. King Holmes of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle said
that the risk of getting AIDS through heterosexual contact
increases in people with genital herpes, syphilis, chancroid and
other diseases that produce genital sores.
   _Dr. Francis Plummer of the University of Manitoba found that
prostitutes in Africa who use birth control pills were two to three
times as likely as other prostitutes to become infected with AIDS.

<TEXT>
   A Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer
claimed victory following settlement of her 4-year-old claim that
she was threatened with dismissal for complaining of sexual
harassment in the office.
   Under terms of the settlement, approved Thursday by U.S.
District Judge John H. Pratt, attorney Catherine Broderick will
receive a promotion, back pay and compensation for psychological
counseling.
   Also as part of the settlement, the SEC agreed to hire an equal
employment opportunity expert to review current commission policies
on sexual harassment and make recommendations for any needed
changes.
   The SEC also said it would hire an impartial third party to
investigate what, if any, disciplinary action should be taken
against Ms. Broderick's former supervisors. The commission said it
would evaluate the results of the investigation and ``take
appropriate disciplinary action,'' then report its actions to the
court and to Ms. Broderick's lawyers.
   In a statement, the SEC said that it ``intends to send a strong
message that it will not tolerate employment discrimination or
harassment of any kind.''
   Ms. Broderick was smiling broadly Thursday after Pratt's action.
She said that she was ``pleased with the settlement. It's
definitely a victory.''
   Pratt ruled last month that Ms. Broderick, who worked for five
years in the SEC's Washington regional office, had suffered sexual
harassment by being forced to work in a hostile environment.
   Following Pratt's ruling, Ms. Broderick told reporters that her
former supervisors had used the office as a ``sexual playground.''
   ``The affairs were carried on at the office and flaunted in
front of other employees,'' Ms. Broderick said at the time. ``They
went out for three-hour lunches and used the office for rendezvous
after work and on weekends.''
   Pratt found that female employees who had sexual or other social
relationships with managers of the regional office's enforcement
division received promotions, positive evaluations and cash bonuses.
   But, the judge said, Ms. Broderick received negative
evaluations, threats of dismissal and eventually a transfer when
she complained.
   Under the settlement worked out by attorneys for the SEC and Ms.
Broderick and approved by Pratt, Ms. Broderick will be moved up two
steps in the federal government's salary listing and will receive
back pay based on salary increases she would have been entitled to
had she received regular promotions. The amount of back pay still
has to be calculated.
   In addition, the SEC agreed to remove any remaining negative
evaluations from her personnel files and to offer her positions in
the division of enforcement and the office of the general counsel.
The SEC also agreed to help pay for psychological counseling
sessions.
   The commission said it also had agreed to help Ms. Broderick
obtain outside employment and pay reasonable costs of out-placement
services if she should decide to look for a job outside the SEC.
   In a statement, SEC Chairman David Ruder noted that the
commission ``for many years, has been a leader in the promotion of
women in the corporate and securities field.''

<HEAD>Scientists Suggest Animal Monogamy, Sibling Altruism Genetically

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two California scientists believe that among
animals, the gene that causes siblings to help and protect each
other may be related to the gene that causes their mother to
practice monogamy.
   A mathematical model created by Marc W. Feldman and Joel R. Peck
of Stanford University and published today in Science magazine
shows a correlation between the altruism that animal brothers and
sisters show for each other and the tendency of their mothers to
mate with only one male.
   The math model suggests that altruism and monogamy ``are a good
combination that produces a situation where the individuals who
carry this combination have more offspring,'' said Feldman in a
telephone interview.
   He said the theory does not apply to humans because altruism
among humans is a learned tendency, but it does apply to animals
where the behavior is instinctive or genetically directed.
   Altruism among animals is an instinct that causes an individual
to support others in the family or group, or even sacrifice life
for the benefit of the others.
   Examples, said Feldman, are bees and wasps that will work to
feed larvae or will attack when the nest is threatened. Other
examples include elephants that will work together to protect the
young of the herd, and mountain gorillas that will defend the
family group.
   Monogamy, the tendency of a female to stay with one mate, is
common in the animal kingdom, said Feldman, and scientists have
long been puzzled how it developed.
   Mating for life occurs among some mammals, such as elephants,
among birds, such as geese and bald eagles, and even among some
fish.
   ``There isn't a very good basis in evolutionary theory for the
(development) of monogamy,'' said Feldman. ``It is a really poorly
understood phenomenon.''
   In the math model, Feldman said, he and Peck demonstrate that
``there is a correlation between the genes that cause altruism and
those that affect mating behavior.''
   He said the two behaviorial genes are linked in such a way that
``if there is a situation for genetic altruism then that is
sufficient to cause an increase in the frequency of genes that
promote monogamy.''
   In effect, said Feldman, ``if you see altruism among siblings,
it helps you to promote monogamy.''
   This, he said, produces the ``Darwinian advantage,'' a reference
to the evolutionary theory put forth by Charles Darwin in the 19th
century that the genetic charactistics that promote the most
reproductive success will tend to become the dominant
characteristics of a species.
   Feldman said his theory has never been tested in the field by
scientists who observe animal behavior, but he hopes they will now
look for evidence that may relate altruism to monogamy.
   He said monogamous birds, rodents and even primates would be
good subjects for observational scientists to test the correlation.
   Feldman is a professor of biology and director of the institute
for population and resources studies at Stanford. Peck is a
researcher in biology at the same institution.

Tackle Problem</HEAD>

   President Reagan's AIDS commission came down
to its final meeting today still undecided on what to recommend in
the way of administrative changes to cope with the epidemic.
   After hearing from about 500 witnesses and concluding that a
cornerstone of the final report should be a call for national
anti-discrimination protection for the more than 1 million
Americans estimated to be infected with the deadly virus, the
13-member panel was split on what _ if any _ changes it should
recommend in the federal health hierarchy. The report is due June
24.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, the commission's chairman,
is on record as favoring the vestment of sweeping new powers in the
office of the Surgeon General _ now Dr. C. Everett Koop _ to cope
with present and future health emergencies such as AIDS.
   However, several commissioners have expressed reservations at
that approach. Some suggested an alternative would be to call for
legislation that would allow the appointment of a special assistant
designated by the president to coordinate battles against
particular health emergencies.
   In an effort to deal with one aspect of what the commission
viewed as a need to take extraordinary procedures in dealing with
health threats like AIDS, the panel agreed tentatively on Thursday
to recommend that the National Institutes of Health have more
independence.
   Although adoption of the specific language was delayed until
today, the commission agreed unanimously with the concept outlined
by Dr. Burton James Lee III of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York City.
   ``As a clinical researcher in cancer medicine, I have worked
with the NIH all of my professional life and it is my strong view
that NIH has been unable to function as effectively as it could
simply because the mechanisms are buried under so much
bureaucracy,'' Lee told his fellow commissioners.
   He won backing for a recommendation that the president direct
that the NIH director report directly to the Health and Human
Services secretary, rather than to subordinates in the department,
for a two-year trial period and that the NIH chief have broad
discretionary budget and personnel authority during that period.
   Lee said if that change in procedure did not result in greater
flexibility for NIH to ``achieve its scientific mandate,'' Congress
should consider setting the NIH up as a separate agency answerable
directly to the White House and Congress.
   Watkins, a strong supporter of Lee's proposal, emphasized that
the change would not alter the requirement for NIH to win its
allocation from Congress in competition with other government needs.
   Nor, he said, would it give the NIH director power to shift
funds from one institute to another _ from the National Institute
on Aging, for example, to the National Cancer Institute.
   Watkins said the main idea was to insulate the NIH director _
now Dr. James B. Wyngaarden _ from having to clear internal
personnel and spending priorities with several layers of
bureaucrats at HHS and, especially, at the Office of Management and
Budget.

   Supreme Court Chief Justice Kim
Yong-chul resigned today after hundreds of judges demanded he step
down to pave the way for democratic reforms and an independent
judicial system.
   ``I did my best to develop the judiciary, but I failed because
of incompetence and lack of virtue on my part,'' Kim, 63, told a
news conference. He said was responsible for loss of public
confidence in the nation's courts.
   The government, which earlier planned to retain Kim, decided to
accept his offer to resign and was seeking a successor, said KBS,
the state-run radio-television network.
   On Wednesday, judges in Seoul called for drastic judicial
reforms and an overhaul of the nation's highest court. More than
280 judges nationwide endorsed the statement.
   The judges said the judiciary has been subservient to the
executive branch of the government and out of step with the
democratic reforms transforming most aspects of South Korean
society. In the past, South Korean courts played a key role in
helping enforce authoritarian rule.
   Many authoritarian controls on politics and other aspects of
South Korean life have been dismantled during the past year after
nationwide riots last summer against the government of former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   The government of President Roh Tae-woo, which took power Feb.
25, has pledged to introduce full democracy.
   Judges calling for Kim's resignation said they issued the
statement because the Supreme Court soon would be reorganized under
a new constitution.
   Kim said he was ``shocked'' when he first heard the report of
the collective action by the judges, but that he decided to accept
their call to resign.
   He said the last three days were ``the most agonizing period of
time in my life.''
   The departing chief justice said he told his top aides that the
judges' action should not be construed as mutiny or insubordination.
   Under the constitution, the Supreme Court chief justice is
appointed by the president with the consent of the National
Assembly.
   Law groups and opposition political parties also have expressed
their support of the judges's call for judicial reforms.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Empathizes With Columnist Who Shot Intruder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, an opponent of gun
control, says he empathizes with Carl Rowan, the syndicated
columnist who shot and wounded a back yard intruder, even though he
doesn't agree with his views.
   ``It's all easy to second-guess now: this was some skinny-dipper
in the Jacuzzi and all. Let others debate that one out there,''
Bush told reporters Thursday.
   Rowan, who has written columns favoring stricter gun control,
shot the trespassing teen-ager _ who had been swimming with a group
of friends in Rowan's back yard pool _ with a pistol police said
was unregistered.
   ``I kind of empathize with what he was going through when
somebody was coming at him,'' Bush said. Rowan has said he fired
the shot after the teen-ager lunged at him, and that the incident
did nothing to soften his support for strict gun control laws.
   Bush spoke with reporters on Air Force Two as he returned to
Washington from Richmond, Va., where he had given a speech on drug
abuse.
   Asked if he had any advice for Rowan, the vice president said:
``No, I don't think I have any advice for him. I'm not having much
fun out of it. I think it's a matter where I can't make much of a
contribution by saying anything....
   ``Let him think it out, sort it out. He doesn't need my
editorial help, just like sometimes I don't need his,'' Bush said.
   Bush also challenged Democrat Michael Dukakis, whom he is nearly
certain to face in the November election, to come up with a price
tag for his proposal for a buildup in conventional forces. Bush
said the Massachusetts governor's proposals could jeopardize
efforts to reach a strategic arms treaty with the Soviets.
   ``Where do you go when you get into the most expensive side of
this of all, which is conventional forces?'' the vice president
asked.
   Jim Steinberg, deputy issues director for the Dukakis campaign,
said halting the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative
would free up funds to pay for strengthening conventional defense.
   Dukakis called for the scrapping of SDI in a foreign policy and
defense speech in Washington earlier this week.
   On other matters, Bush:
   _Said he sees ``no conflict at all'' in the fact that the
lobbying firm headed by his newly named communications adviser,
James H. Lake, represents Japanese auto-parts and electronics
companies. Noting that Lake was an unsalaried volunteer, Bush said:
``Are we going to go now and look at every client for every law
firm for every volunteer?''
   _Contended he had no recollection of ever having met former
Wedtech Corp. President Anthony Guariglia, who testified at the
Wedtech corruption trial this week in New York that he sought
Bush's help as part of an effort to obtain a Navy pontoon contract
in exchange for raising $200,000 for President Reagan's 1984
re-election campaign.
   ``Was the guy ever at a fund raiser or something? Maybe. But I
don't remember anything, the name or anything about him,'' Bush
said.
   _Said he didn't favor relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem, which the Israelis claim as their capital.
``Jerusalem should never be divided again, but it should be a
matter that should be part of the negotiations to bring peace to
the Middle East,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis has said he favors relocating the embassy, but later
denied saying he accepted Israel's claim to sovereignty over all of
Jerusalem.
   _Said he favors action by Congress in including a repeal of the
windfall profits tax on oil in a new stripped-down trade bill
designed to avoid another presidential veto, but still has problems
with parts of the bill ``that erode presidential power.''
   Bush was to spend today in Washington. On Saturday, he was to
visit a family farm near Springfield, Ill., and attend Republican
rallies in Springfield and in Chicago.

   Car thieves like sporty special models and in
some cases they're interested in only the radio, says an insurance
industry study. The cars safest from theft are small- and mid-sized
domestics, especially station wagons.
   A report by the Highway Loss Data Institute said Thursday that
the likelihood of theft ranges widely among cars and that the most
frequent targets are Volkswagens where the radio is easy to steal
and is a powerful lure.
   A study of 1985-87 model cars found seven Volkswagens among the
11 car models with the highest rate of theft claims. All 11 cars
were imports, and in many cases thieves were only interested in the
radios, said the report.
   The radios ``are easily accessible,'' said Rick Elder, vice
president of the insurance group, in an interview. ``You can snap
them out of one car and easily put them into another. It's a very
attractive theft target.''
   But when thieves are out to steal an entire car they are likely
to pick expensive sporty models, including a number of U.S. cars,
the study concluded. High on the list is the Porsche 911 Coupe,
followed by the Chevrolet Corvette and the Chevrolet Camaro, the
report said.
   It said sports and speciality cars continued to account ``for an
overwhelming share of total theft losses.'' While these cars
account for about 15 percent of the total number of cars insured,
they represent 40 percent of the dollars paid on insurance claims
because of theft.
   The least likely cars to be stolen or broken into are small and
mid-sized domestic models, led by the Mercury Lynx, said the
insurance group.
   According to the report, the Volkwagen GTI, which had the
highest theft rate, was nearly 70 times as likely to be the target
of a thief as the Lynx.
   Other cars with little interest from thieves, according to the
study, were the Mercury Grand Marquis station wagon and Mercury
Topaz, the Plymouth Colt Vista wagon and Pontiac Sunbird wagon.
   The study covered 1985-87 models.
   Among vans, pickup trucks and utility vehicles, the 1985 Jeep
CJ-7 and the 1986 and 1987 Suzuki Samurai had the highest
likelihood for theft. Small pickup trucks generally had the lowest
theft rate.
   Some cars lost the interest of thieves after their design
changed or in some cases security devices were installed, the
report said. For example the theft rate for the Chevrolet Corvette
declined somewhat after new security system was put in the 1986
model.
   But it said design changes in the Mazda RX-7 and Toyota Celica
resulted in sharply lower theft losses in 1986 and 1987. Elder
attributed the decline to thieves not having a market for the newly
designed parts.
   ``The demand for the stolen parts hasn't built up,'' he
suggested.
   Meanwhile, theft losses for the Buick Regal and Chevrolet Monte
Carlo, both of which adopted a more sporty look in 1987, increased
sharply that year, the report said.
   The report tracked theft losses during the first year of
availability for the 1987 models cars, the first two years of
availability for 1986 models and the first three years of
availability for 1985 models.
   The Highway Loss Data Institute, which is part of the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, gathers and processes a broad range
of insurance statistical data.

   Fears of a Japanese terrorist attack have led
police and intelligence forces to put a $4.9 million security net
around the coming Economic Summit in Canada's largest city.
   On Thursday, police helicopters swirled overhead, checking the
tops of skyscrapers in downtown Toronto, while about 3,000 officers
and security agents prepared to protect the leaders of the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and the
European Commission.
   A Japanese diplomat in Manila said a suspected Japanese Red Army
terrorist arrested in the Philippines last week had planned to
establish a base for attacks on the Toronto summit and the Olympics
in Seoul, South Korea.
   Metropolitan Toronto Police Supt. Bernard Nadeau said the report
was being investigated.
   He said Canadian immigration officers had stepped up scrutiny of
everyone entering the country and that demonstrators of any kind
will not be allowed anywhere near the three-day meeting, which
starts Sunday.
   The first leaders will reach Toronto today. President Reagan
will be among the last to arrive on Sunday morning.
   ``The biggest threat is terrorism,'' Nadeau said in an
interview. ``Historically, they've always been active at summit
conferences. They have a way of getting into a country illegally.''
   The reported arrest in the Philippines follows the detention of
a suspected Japanese Red Army terrorist, Yu Kikumura, 35, on the
New Jersey Turnpike in April. Police found homemade pipe bombs and
false papers in his car.
   On June 12, an 18-year-old Japanese college student, Yoshio
Kosugi, was arrested in Philadelphia when police found a rifle and
grenades in his luggage.
   Japan's radical Middle Core Faction fired five homemade rockets
during the Tokyo summit in 1986, but the projectiles fell short of
their target.
   In a message directed at any terrorist groups contemplating an
attack in Toronto, security officials this month put on a
demonstration by a rapid deployment assault squad trained for the
summit. Borne by helicopters and equipped with high-powered M-16
rifles, the commandos will not be seen again ``unless something
happens,'' Nadeau said.
   Police said Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Reagan are considered the most
likely targets, in Reagan's case possibly from Middle East
extremists or a lone attacker such as John Hinckley, Jr., who shot
and wounded the president in 1981.
   Mrs. Thatcher narrowly escaped injury at a party conference in
Brighton, England, on Oct. 12, 1984, when the Irish Republican Army
planted a bomb in her hotel.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for a booby-trap bomb that killed
six British soldiers in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, on Wednesday.
   ``We're uncomfortable any time British royalty visits, or anyone
connected with the British government,'' Nadeau said. ``We're
always concerned that the IRA could be active.''
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz wants terrorism on the
summit agenda, including a proposal for all countries to deny
refueling to airplane hijackers. He said the fight against
terrorism must be renewed because it appears to be on the rise
again.
   Security around the leaders will be so tight that Toronto's 3.4
million residents are unlikely to get a glimpse of them except on
television, police said. Highways will be closed as motorcades come
and go, and up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off at given times.
   ``The leaders are not here to be seen by the people,'' said
Nadeau. `This is a business meeting and that's the way it will be
treated.''
   Local businessmen have criticized Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
for staging the summit in the heart of Canada's biggest city. The
original idea, starting with the first Economic Summit at
Rambouillet, France, in 1975, was to allow world leaders to thrash
out problems at a quiet retreat, well out of public view.
   Previous North American gatherings have been at the Puerto Rican
resort of Dorado; Montebello, Quebec; and Williamsburg, Va. The
1987 summit was on an island in Venice.
   Mulroney reportedly chose Toronto to help boost the city's bid
for the 1996 Olympic Games and to quell resentment after the
federal government granted tax-free international banking center
status to Montreal and Vancouver but left out Toronto.

Germany.
   However, West German officials said only that the Soviet pianist
had been granted an extension of his temporary residency permit.
   ``We had a call from the (West German) Foreign Ministry

Embassy spokesman Andre Serjogin said Thursday in Bonn.
   But spokesmen for the West German Foreign and Interior
ministries said they had no information about the matter.
   Bunin came to West Germany on a concert tour.

   Britain's chief financial official predicted the
leading industrialized nations will agree to grant major debt
relief to the poorest countries at an economic summit next week.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also said Britain will
press at the seven-nation meeting for a freeze on the huge
subsidies rich countries pay their farmers.
   The official of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government said Britain has a three-point plan for debt concessions
to help the poorest countries, mainly Africa's sub-Saharan nations.
   ``For the first time, I feel we are close to an agreement,''
Lawson said this week.
   He said resistance to major concessions to the Africans at
previous summits was based partly on fears of touching off demands
by the biggest debtors, the Latin American nations, for similar
concessions.
   ``That resistance is now crumbling,'' said Lawson. ``People do
now accept it is necessary to address the problems of these nations
(the Africans) separately.''
   Lawson's plan is one of several proposals on how to tackle the
overwhelming debts of the poorest countries. The plans will be put
forward at the June 19-21 summit of the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain, West Germany, France and Italy.
   The British plan envisages writing off long-standing government
aid loans to the poorest countries, rescheduling other debts and
granting concessionary interest rates.
   In a separate initiative, French President Francois Mitterrand,
a Socialist, announced last week he will propose the seven nations
wipe out one-third of the debts owed to them by the poorest
countries, or slash interest rates, or extend repayment periods.
   Mrs. Thatcher has led attempts in the European Economic
Community, a 12-nation trading bloc, to curb a runaway farm budget.
   In Toronto, Britain was likely to fall in its views midway
between the United States, which has proposed eliminating farm
subsidies by the year 2000, and the other Europeans, who envisage
controls on continuing subsidies.
   Lawson said statistics showed Japan subsidized its agricultural
production by 75 percent in 1986, up from 54 percent in 1980.
   He said the European Community subsidy was 49 percent in 1986,
the latest year available, up from 36 percent in 1980, and the
United States 35 percent, up from 15 percent.
   In a television interview in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz said farm subsidies were costing the United States,
Western Europe and Japan $150 billion a year.
   Speaking on the U.S. Information Agency TV program ``Worldnet,''
he described the situation as ``crazy,'' and said, ``Let the market
rule.''

<TEXT>
   Sales of anti-Semitic literature are growing in
Japan even as Japan-Israel ties improve and Foreign Minister Sosuke
Uno prepares to become the first Japanese Cabinet minister ever to
make an official visit to Israel.
   ``According to one publisher we spoke to, 1 percent of all books
sold in Japan deal with the theme of the Jewish conspiracy in the
world economy,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center, the second-largest Jewish organization in
the United States.
   Uno is scheduled to leave next Wednesday for a tour of the
Middle East that will take him to Israel, Syria, Jordan and Egypt.
His visit will be the first ever by a Cabinet official since Japan
opened diplomatic ties with Israel in 1952, according to the
Foreign Ministry.
   Books blaming everything from the Chernobyl nuclear accident to
the rapid appreciation of the yen on the ``Jewish conspiracy''
brought Cooper and Alfred Balitzer, professor of political science
at California's Claremont McKenna College, to Japan last week.
   Cooper pointed to scores of books laid out on a table in his
Tokyo hotel room. The cover of one showed a blue Star of David
transposed over a sign post saying Wall Street.
   Over 80,000 copies of ``Understand the Jews and the Epoch Comes
into View'' by Masami Uno, the most popular writer in the genre,
have been printed since the book was released less than one month
ago, said a spokesman for the Nihon Bungei publishing house.
   In all, sales of Uno's three main books go into the hundreds of
thousands of copies.
   Foreign Minister Uno is not related to the author.
   Titles of books by other writers include, ``How to Make Money
with Stocks the Jews Aim At'' and ``The Jewish Plan for Conquest of
the World.''
   ``There is 100 times as much printed in the United States, but
none sell like this. Here they sell like hotcakes and no one speaks
out against them,'' Balitzer said.
   ``The people of Israel are not Japan watchers, but they read the
newspapers and they see articles about these books.''
   Cooper said, ``This may be a bum rap for Uno when he goes to
Israel, but if Japanese leaders decide to avoid answering this
issue, their silence will be taken by Arabs as a deep reservoir of
anti-Jewish feelings.''
   He said the Japanese government has remained quiet on the issue
to avoid conflict with Arab nations, which supply Japan with 70
percent of its oil.
   In 1987, then Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari denounced
anti-Semitic writings in the Diet, Japan's parliament, but it was
largely ignored by the Japanese media.
   An Israeli official in Tokyo said he doubted whether the issue
will be raised during Uno's visit, but he said the Israeli
government has expressed informal concern.
   ``The matter doesn't directly affect us,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The real target of the books is American
Jews. In Israel it is just seen as strange that Japanese would
write such things.''
   Cooper and Balitzer believe the books represent more than
anything else ignorance and curiousity about the Jews, who number
400 households in Japan. Only six of those families reside here
permanently.
   ``It's anti-Semitism without anti-Semites. We see no problem of
violence directed against the Jewish community here,'' Cooper
explained. ``Most Japanese don't really know what a Jew is.''
   Balitzer said: ``When the authors say the Jews control the
world, they see to be admiring this. Their attitude is, `How can we
do that?'''
   A Foreign Ministry official, also speaking privately, said he
did not know whether the issue would be discussed. ``Publication of
such books is legal and can't be stopped, but it is unwanted by
us.''
   When asked why it has taken 36 years for Japan to send a Cabinet
minister to Israel, the official said: ``There are many nations yet
to be officially visited. There is no special reason.''
   The Israeli official said Israeli-Japanese trade volume was up
84 percent in the first three months of this year. Israel maintains
a trade surplus with Japan, and the Israeli government estimates
trade between the two countries this year will total $1.2 billion.

   Eyeing the modern landscape, Southern
Baptists see a host of evils: abortion, drug abuse, homosexuality,
materialism, secular humanism, sexual promiscuity, rebellion
against authority and the ``New Age'' movement.
   These and other present-day manifestations were declared blights
on human life as 32,727 ``messengers'' from the nation's largest
Protestant denomination concluded their annual convention Thursday.
   The New Age movement, a relatively recent arrival among the
church's list of repudiated trends, was likened to an underlying
disorder behind them all.
   ``The philosophy ... is as old as the Garden of Eden, where
Satan perpetrated three of the false beliefs of the New Age
movement, promising you will be wise, you will be as gods and you
will not die,'' a convention resolution said.
   It said the movement ``has become a powerful political,
philosophical and economic force in our contemporary culture and is
exerting its influence into every facet of American life.''
   While its aim is to ``become a one-world religion,'' it is
``diametrically contrary to both New Testament Christianity and our
American heritage,'' the resolution said.
   It said the movement ``gives people false hope by its beliefs in
reincarnation, (and) in endeavoring to reveal a person's future
through astrology, fortune telling and palm reading.''
   Other purported beliefs of the New Age movement listed by the
resolution are that there are ``many ways to eternal life, and that
all will be saved by secular humanism, which testifies by its own
manifesto (that) no deity will save us, we must save ourselves.''
   The media and entertainment industry ``gives the New Age
movement widespread acceptance and crediblity, helping it finds its
way into every facet of American life,'' the resolution said.
   It was among a score of resolutions deploring an ``erosion of
moral sanity'' adopted by the annual convention of the
14.7-million-member denomination.
   The five-day meeting, including two preliminary days of
virtually non-stop preaching and auxiliary conferences, featured a
running conflict between fundamentalist and moderate factions of
the divided denomination.
   It was the 10th year in which fundamentalists predominated in
the convention's presidential election, which was won by the Rev.
Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., and in approving measures pushed
by their camp.
   A resolution that was exceptionally disturbing to moderates puts
limitations on a classic Protestant concept, the ``priesthood of
the believer,'' which asserts equal rights and authority of laity
and clergy.
   The convention declared that ``misunderstanding and abuse'' of
the doctrine had undermined the authority of pastors over their
congregations.
   This prompted sharp protests from moderates, who charged it
betrayed a principle of the 16th century Protestant reformation.
About 200 dissenters marched to the Alamo, where they tore up
copies of the resolution.
   The convention approved a 1988-89 national budget of $145.6
million, up $5.6 million from this year's, which includes increases
for all church agencies except the Baptist Joint Committee on
Public Affairs.
   That agency, representing eight Baptist bodies on church-state
and religious liberty issues, has been under fire by
fundamentalists, and allocations to it were cut by $48,400.
   Its executive director, the Rev. James Dunn of Washington,
received enthusiastic applause Thursday when he gave the agency's
report, particularly when he praised the ``priesthood of the
believer'' concept as enshrining members' liberty against clerical
encroachment.
   Trustees of the denomination's social-ethics agency, the
Christian Life Commission, said a search was on for a ``doctrinally
sound'' director who favors the death penalty and opposes abortion.
The agency's previous director, the Rev. Larry Baker, quit under
fundamentalist pressure over his positions on those issues.

<HEAD>Figures in Pentagon Probe Used `Revolving Door'</HEAD>

   The strongest advocates of closing the
``revolving door'' connecting Pentagon procurement officials with
defense contractors used to blame the system _ not the integrity of
individuals _ for problems in military purchasing.
   But a growing bribery investigation indicates the problem is
even worse than imagined by the critics, who have long sought ways
to curb the departure of top Pentagon officials for jobs with
companies doing business with the Defense Department.
   A search warrant revealed Thursday that the government is
investigating the ``bribery of public officials'' as part of a
scheme in which defense contractors got inside information from
former government officials whom they had hired as consultants.
   Now, the integrity of individuals is under attack as well as the
system, in which the Defense Department relies on a small number of
large contractors _ whose main business is selling to the Pentagon.
   This lack of competition ``blurred the healthy distinction
between buyer and seller and this is vividly illustrated when we
look at the problem of the `revolving door,''' Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif. said in congressional testimony back in 1985.
   She said that as the numbers of high-ranking government
officials moving to defense contractors increased, the interests of
the Pentagon and the corporate suppliers merged.
   ``The real problem with an environment that stresses cooperation
between contractor and government is that no one is watching out
for the taxpayer,'' she said. ``The result is a procurement system
in which price is the least important factor.''
   But she added then, ``One thing is clear: The integrity of
individual procurement officials is not the issue. What is
important is an existing employment pattern that does not protect
the public against the misuse of its tax dollars.''
   Thursday, as new information on the latest scandal became
public, Boxer recognized the change.
   ``Now, it is bad enough that such a situation undermines public
confidence in the procurement system,'' she said in a floor speech.
``It is far worse to learn that former and current public officials
may have broken the law in a rush to cash in on the contracts that
they gained at taxpayers' expense. Nothing could be lower than
that.''
   And in a letter, she asked the Defense Department inspector
general's office to determine whether ``there is cause to believe''
that any former Pentagon official who walked through the revolving
door violated a 1987 law.
   The law prohibits former top Pentagon employees or military
officers from accepting pay from contractors for a two-year period
in jobs involving defense procurement.
   The law includes civil fines of up to $250,000 for ex-government
officers who violate the provision, and up to $500,000 for anyone
who offers or actually pays compensation to the ex-official _ while
knowing such compensation violates the law.
   The law does not apply to companies with contracts of less than
$10 million.
   The Senate tightened the noose last April. By voice vote, it
passed ethics legislation that said top executive branch officials,
including generals and admirals, could not lobby the executive
branch or members of Congress for a year.
   A House Judiciary subcommittee, headed by Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., is working on its version of the legislation.
   A 10-year-old law makes it a crime for an executive branch
official to lobby his or her former agency within a year of leaving
the agency.
   An illustration of the revolving door is the case of Melvyn R.
Paisley, a major target in the current probe.
   He left his Navy job in April 1987 to become a Washington
consultant, and some of the largest defense contractors lined up to
hire him.
   Paisley, 63, had played a key role in President Reagan's naval
build-up. As a private businessman, he was selling information, a
commodity much in demand among the various companies seeking any
edge they could get in the chance to sell weapons to the government.
   In the past, there have been news stories about men like former
Gen. Alton D. Slay, who retired from the Air Force Feb. 1, 1981.
With the military, he was involved in decision-making on numerous
major weapons systems.
   After retirement, he formed a consulting firm, Slay Enterprises
Inc., with clients that included top contractors with whom he had a
long association.
   One was Lockheed. In 1969, as commander of the Air Force Flight
Test Center, Slay had declared tests on Lockheed's C-5A cargo plane
successful, even though the plane's engines clogged and had to be
shut down while idling.
   How bad has the problem been?
   A General Accounting Office study in 1986 said more than 20
percent of the people who left jobs at the Pentagon in 1983 and
1984 to join defense contractors were spending at least some time
working on the same projects they had previously overseen.
   The study added that 45 percent of the former Pentagon employees
said their new jobs in industry required them to communicate with
former colleagues at the Pentagon, and 26 percent acknowledged they
were in positions to affect the work of their future employer
during their last two years at the Pentagon.
   The study was entitled, ``The DoD Revolving Door.''

<HEAD>Publishers Ponder How To Conquer Third World `Book Hunger'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 650 leading publishers from 50 countries
have spent this week finding ways to conquer ``book hunger'' in the
developing world, which experts say is nearing crisis proportions
in many countries.
   The International Publishers Association chose ``The Dilemma of
Book Hunger'' as the theme of its 23rd congress and said feeding
this hunger was a key to development in the Third World and to
expansion of worldwide publishing.
   Guest speakers including Foreign Minister Natwar Singh of India,
Culture Minister Wang Meng of China, UNESCO Director-General Dr.
Federico Mayor and Wole Soyinka, winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for
Literature, all agreed that cash-starved developing countries face
great difficulty in obtaining and producing the books they need.
   ``Although the number of titles published has nearly tripled in
the last 30 years, the gulf between the `haves' and the `have-nots'
persists,'' said Mayor.
   Tony Read, director of the Book Development Council, the
overseas division of the British Publishers Association, said a
survey of a small, unspecified English-speaking African country in
1980 found the average availability of textbooks in primary schools
was 11 textbooks per 1,000 students _ and the situation had gotten
worse.
   In some countries, he said, ``books are virtually not available
anywhere in the educational system at all'' and in others, only at
secondary or university levels.
   ``Dozens of examples could be produced from a wide range of
countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin American and east and
south Asia to demonstrate the fact of book hunger which in many
cases becomes actual book starvation,'' he said in a report to the
congress.
   J. Alexis Koutchoumow, the association's secretary-general, said
one of the main causes is that ``governments do not really grant
the needful priority to the book _ and yet the book is vital to
training at every level.''
   Read said books could be made available more cheaply to
developing countries in three ways: by government aid, by licensing
reproduction rights at the lowest possible cost, and by having
publishers in advanced nations produce special low-cost editions
for developing nations.
   But Soyinka said no amount of foreign aid will solve the problem
of book hunger unless developing countries themselves make a
political commitment to conquer it.
   Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and an
expert on reading skills, said only 5 percent of books produced in
Arab countries deal with basic sciences and only 10 percent with
applied sciences.
   She said there was an urgent need for collaboration between
international and national publishers to make serious educational
and cultural publications accessible to developing nations.
   ``Countries like Japan and Korea, who have made spectacular
progress in the postwar era, have concentrated their efforts on the
promotion of the physical sciences and mathematics, both within the
school and beyond,'' she said.
   ``This is definitely the example to be followed by other Third
World nations if they are to narrow the existing scientific and
technological gap between them and the industrialized nations.''
   Mayor noted that 1990 has been designated International Literacy
Year by the United Nations and urged the publishers to join in the
campaign to teach every child and adult to read by the turn of the
century.
   He also called on the publishers to join UNESCO in studying
cheaper ways to produce and distribute books in developing nations.
   Singh urged advanced publishing nations not to use developing
countries as dumping grounds for ``intellectually inferior crumbs
in glossy jackets'' and not to perpetuate their own intellectual
dominance and versions of history.

<HEAD>$44.1 Farm Spending Blueprint Clears House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $44.1 billion blueprint for next year's farm
spending has won House approval and now is headed for the Senate,
where a slightly more expensive version is in the works.
   Urban grumbling about farm program costs preceded 343-54 House
approval of the measure, which is $2.5 billion below the
administration's request and $12 billion below this year's level.
   Complaints were less strident, though, than last year's outcry
following disclosures of million-dollar payments to huge
agribusiness concerns as part of programs supposedly designed to
rescue family farmers.
   Criticism was muted somewhat by fresh curbs imposed by Congress
on the size of individual farm payments.
   Meanwhile, expanded U.S. exports plus a revival in the farm
economy have reduced program outlays from a peak of $26 billion in
1986 to a current level estimated at about $17 billion.
   The House measure calls for outlays of $44.1 billion for the
fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. A rival measure still being
fashioned by the Senate would produce an additional $3 billion in
spending.
   Contained in the House measure are $16.3 billion for food and
nutrition programs, $12.4 billion for rural development and $6.8
billion to replace losses of the government-owned Commodity Credit
Corp., which operates USDA's price and income support programs.
   The level for covering Commodity Credit Corp. losses was $14.3
billion below the amount approved last year and represented the
major savings in the bill. Some critics said the plan appeared
overly optimistic and that a supplemental appropriation might be
needed later.
   ``It appears to me that there are lots of mirrors on the ceiling
and lots of smoke coming from the cloakroom,'' said Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa.
   Declines in program costs did not completely mute urban critics
of the farm program.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about the Targeted
Export Assistance program, which subsidizes advertising and
promotion of U.S. farm exports. He said a report from the General
Accounting Office showed mismanagement.
   He lauded the Appropriations Committee for rejecting a proposed
increase in the program, and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said
there would be Agriculture Committee hearings on the issue later in
the summer.
   The House spent two hours debating a proposal by Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi, R-N.Y., to bar new Farmers Home Administration loans to
borrowers already in default. In a brief parliamentary skirmish,
farm lawmakers then prevented DioGuardi from bringing the measure
to a vote.
   They received lopsided support from most of their urban
colleagues.

   Chicago's central library, burned down in the
great fire of 1871 and housed over the next 100 years in an old
water tank and a warehouse, will get a new $140 million home
designed in a yearlong contest.
   An 11-member committee is expected to announce Monday its choice
of one of five teams competing to design and build the Harold
Washington Library Center, honoring the city's first black mayor,
who died in November.
   The jury includes Vincent Scully of Yale University's History of
Art Department and architect Henry Cobb of the architectural firm
I.M. Pei & Partners of New York.
   Proposals for the design of the 700,000-square-foot library
range from a bold, futuristic look to a more traditional 11-story
office building.
   Inside, the library will offer international television programs
picked up by satellite, a 400-seat theater and a 2.3-million-volume
book collection.
   The Chicago Public Library Board of Directors plans to vote June
28 to accept or reject the jury's recommendation.
   Crowds have pored over the proposed models and sketches on
display in the former central library, now a cultural center.
   About 15,000 people filled out comment cards in the exhibit's
first 10 days, forcing the city to print 70,000 additional cards,
said Elizabeth Hollander, Chicago's commissioner of planning.
   She refused to reveal any of the comments, which were forwarded
to the jury. But each design has ``attracted passionate opinions
both for and against,'' she said.
   In addition to the architectural goals, the city has a practical
one. With its scheduled completion in 1991, Chicago's central
library will be adequately housed for the first time in decades.
   After the fire of 1871 destroyed the library along with most of
the city, the library was housed in an old water tank. A central
library was constructed in 1897, but it was deemed inadequate
within two decades.
   To make way for the cultural center, the city moved the central
library collection into a warehouse in 1974. Though the materials
are accessible to the public, the city doesn't consider the
facility a central library.
   A number of sites were proposed for the library _ including an
abandoned State Street department store _ and in 1986, the city
finally decided on a site in the south Loop.
   The design competition has been compared to the famed 1922
Tribune Tower contest, which drew hundreds of entries from
architects worldwide to design the home of the Chicago Tribune. But
only five teams submitted designs for the library.
   The Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects
blames the dirth of competitors on the contest's strict rules,
which require an architect and contractor to team up to submit
plans that include designing and building. The process is intended
to avoid cost overruns, and establishes a strict timetable for
completion.
   ``We endorse design-build competition as a process,'' said John
Syvertsen, vice president of the Chicago AIA board. But ``a
design-build competition is inappropriate for a building of this
complexity.''
   Toronto architect Arthur Erickson of the John Buck Company
developed a design that employs bold geometric shapes and a huge
outdoor plaza.
   Adrian Smith of the Chicago firm of Skidmore Owings & Merrill
designed a cube-like building that blends traditional library looks
with contemporary architecture for the Library '88 Partnership
entry.
   Chicago architect Dirk Lohan of the Metropolitan-Lohan Team also
employed a cubic style that has the look of an office building.
   Architect Helmut Jahn of Chicago designed for the
Paschen-Tishman-Jahn team a building that is elevated 80 feet, with
several structures underneath.
   Chicagoan Thomas Beeby, dean of the Yale School of Architecture,
designed a cube that is faced with brick on three sides and glass
on the fourth.
   Despite the differing designs, the jury will be concerned about
more than looks.
   ``It's like a beautiful woman,'' said Norman Ross, a former vice
president of the First National Bank of Chicago and jury chairman.
``It's nice to be attracted to what's on the outside. (But) if
you're not more concerned about what's on the inside, then you're
in trouble.''

<HEAD>Ortega Warns Political Opposition Not To Interfere With Economic
Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega told domestic
critics they were ``playing with fire'' by opposing new economic
measures to heal the war-ravaged economy and warned of a crackdown
if the criticism continued.
   Ortega said Thursday that opponents of his program, which
includes a drastic devaluation of the national currency and a big
increase in the price of gasoline, ``could disappear if they don't
respond with the patriotism our country demands.''
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista government announced Wednesday a
major devaluation of the cordoba, Nicaragua's currency. One U.S.
dollar is now worth 80 cordobas at the official rate. Before the
devaluation, it was worth 13 cordobas.
   The president announced an end to government control of wages
and prices in a speech on Tuesday. He said the Nicaraguan economy
was a ``free market in a revolutionary state oriented toward
socialism.''
   The government also nearly doubled the price of gasoline on
Wednesday.
   Ortega told factory workers on Thursday that the Superior
Council of Private Enterprise, the conservative newspaper La Prensa
and opposition political parties ``were playing with fire'' in
opposing the changes.
   The government was prepared ``to strike and barricade the
political space to those who aren't in agreement with the economic
measures,'' Ortega said.
   ``We saw ourselves obligated to take measures that we did not
want to take,'' he said in explaining the reforms to the workers.
But he added the program was not ``a concession in political
ideology, nor is it a return to capitalism.''
   On Tuesday, the president said the changes were needed to spur
production and enable the economy to survive the damage inflicted
by the more than 6-year-old war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The United States has accompanied its assistance to the rebels
with severe economic sanctions against Nicaragua. The Sandinistas
say the war has caused $3 billion in damages to the economy.
   The government last enacted economic reforms in February, when
it set monthly wages at between $50 and $70 and official prices for
nearly all basic products.

<HEAD>Panama Suffering A `Virus of Corruption,' Ousted Vice President
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RODRIGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama is suffering from a ``virus of
corruption'' and the political crisis can only worsen as long as
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remains in power, ousted vice president
Roderick Esquivel said.
   ``Panama is like a home with termites, from a distance one sees
a beautifully painted house and from the inside everything is
falling down,'' Esquivel said in an interview Thursday with The
Associated Press.
   ``The whole building is worm-eaten,'' he added. ``We have to
shun the virus of corruption and the authoritarianism that is
consuming us.''
   The military-controlled legislative assembly ousted Esquivel and
President Eric Arturo Delvalle in February after Delvalle tried to
fire Noriega, commander of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces.
   The general, Panama's de facto ruler, was indicted by two U.S.
federal grand juries on drug trafficking charges. He has
successfully resisted U.S. economic sanctions that were aimed at
forcing him to step down but instead have severely damaged Panama's
economy.
   Esquivel returned to his private medical practice after he was
ousted. He made his comments in his office in Panama City.
   Esquivel said the country's political and economic crises will
worsen because of Noriega's ``stubbornness in maintaining
authoritarianism.''
   ``A complete reconstruction has become necessary in Panama, but
not with words, not with rhetoric,'' Esquivel said. ``We have to
rebuild the reputation of the country, the banking system,
education, the system of medical assistance.''
   Esquivel said the Liberal Party, which he heads, may ally itself
with other opposition parties for the May 1989 elections but said
current conditions prohibited a fair ballot.
   To hold elections now ``would be like putting the finishing
touches on a democratic masquerade,'' he said.

   While world leaders wrestle with the global
economy at next week's summit, most of their spouses will eye
designer outfits, listen to children read stories, and browse
landscape paintings.
   Many spouses will accompany leaders to the summit of seven top
industrialized nations next week in Toronto.
   Mila Mulroney, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
will host a welcoming dinner for spouses Sunday at the Royal
Ontario Museum in downtown Toronto. A gala fashion show will follow
with 13 top designers, including Alfred Sung and Wayne Clark, who
have created new outfits for the occasion.
   On Monday, 150 elementary school children will read stories for
the spouses in a program organized by Frontier College, a national
non-profit institution that combats illiteracy.
   In the evening, the spouses will visit one of Canada's greatest
treasures: the collection of landscape paintings by the early 20th
Century artists known as the Group of Seven. The paintings are
housed at the McMichael Gallery in Kleinburg, an hour north of
Toronto.
   The spouses join their husbands at a luncheon hosted by Canadian
Governor General Jeanne Sauve at the Art Gallery of Ontario on
Tuesday, the final day of the summit.

   The lower house of Congress accused
cocaine kingpins of trying to take over the government and called
for a united front to preserve democracy.
   The declaration was approved unanimously Thursday in response to
allegations that top government and military officials are being
paid by the drug lords.
   On Wednesday, the government closed a radio station and a
television station that broadcast a talk show with convicted
cocaine trafficker Roberto Suarez Gomez. The government accused the
stations of violating the law and of slandering the government and
the president.
   The congressional statement said, ``The international drug mafia
is not hesitating to use all its resources to dirty the honor of
(government) institutions.''
   It said cocaine traffickers are ``trying to undermine the
democratic system for the purpose of assuming political power.''
   Bolivia, a country of 6.7 million in the heart of South America,
produces a third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and European
markets.
   In recent weeks Congress has been investigating a series of
videotaped meetings in 1985 between Suarez Gomez and a top
congressmen, a retired general and other political figures.
   A special session of Congress has been deliberating a stringent
anti-drug bill that would declare most of the country's coca
plantations illegal, but the investigation has delayed a vote on
the proposed law.
   In the first three months of this year, Bolivian police and U.S.
drug agents confiscated four tons of cocaine paste, the same amount
confiscated during all of last year.
   The U.S. government has said part of its economic assistance to
South America's poorest country depends on passing the tough drug
bill.
   Coca leaf farmers have marched and organized road blocks to
protest the proposed outlawing of coca leaf growing.

   President Reagan may visit the parched
Midwest, although no such trip is yet on his public schedule,
Reagan's spokesman said after announcing an interagency panel
appointed by the president to deal with the widespread drought.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said he expected the drought to
be on the agenda for the seven-nation economic summit June 19-21 in
Toronto, at least for discussion with Canada and probably with
other countries as well.
   Fitzwater said the task force will ``study current federal
programs that address the situation to determine their adequacy and
effectiveness.''
   He said the task force will include Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and representatives
of the vice president's office, the Army Corps of Engineers, the
Energy Department, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Office of
Management and Budget and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   When asked if emergency assistance to drought-stricken farmers
would be expedited, Fitzwater said no decisions had been made but
the emergency management agency was included because of its role in
providing such relief.
   The group will be known as the Interagency Drought Policy
Committee.
   After making an initial report in two weeks on the immediate
situation, the group is to make an additional report in 30 days on
more long-range problems.
   ``The president is very concerned about the current drought and
wants to make certain that everything that the federal government
can do to assist will be done,'' said Fitzwater, who grew up on a
farm in Kansas.
   A spokesman for Vice President George Bush said Bush is visiting
Chicago and Springfield, Ill., on Saturday and might visit drought
areas.
   When asked if he could put the drought in a personal context
based on his own experience, Fitzwater said:
   ``There is no more hopeless or helpless feeling than seeing your
crops dry up, because there is no alleviating that disaster. If you
are a farmer and you've secured big loans for your crops, you've
borrowed money to put that seed in the ground, and you know it's
not going to yield you anything.''
   Fitzwater also spoke of a visit to Kansas at the end of May and
said, ``You could already see the wheat and corn had been stunted;
in many fields, normal wheat would be up about three feet high, and
the wheat was thin, sparse and about six inches.''

   Rebels killed two government soldiers
in an ambush violating a cease-fire and kidnapped six civilians
around the country, the Defense Ministry said.
   Two army soldiers were killed and three wounded when U.S.-backed
Contra rebels attacked three army trucks in northern Jinotega
province on Wednesday, the ministry reported Thursday in a
statement.
   It said the six civilians were kidnapped in various parts of the
country but provided no details.
   The rebels made no statement about the killings or abductions.
   The leftist Sandinista government and the rebels suspended
offensive military operations on March 21, two days before they
agreed to negotiate a permanent cease-fire to the 6{-year-old civil
war.
   The latest round of talks broke down last week, and each side
has accused the other of violating the truce.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega accused the Contras of
``flagrant violations of the cease-fire'' in a letter sent Thursday
to Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of
American States, and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo,
the archbishop of Managua.
   Soares and Obando y Bravo served as witnesses to the
Sandinista-Contra peace talks and are responsible for verifying the
cease-fire accords.
   Ortega also complained that Contra leaders were seeking renewed
military aid from the United States in violation of the agreements.
   In Washington, Alfredo Cesar, a member of the Contra
directorate, told reporters Thursday the Reagan administration had
pledged to seek bipartisan Congressional support for a new military
aid package for the rebels.
   The United States has funded, equipped and trained the rebels,
who began their fight to topple the Sandinistas in 1981.
   Ortega asked Soares and Obando y Bravo to investigate the
civilian kidnappings and criticized a rebel proposal to include
President Oscar Arnulfo Arias of Costa Rica in future peace talks.
   Arias received last year's Nobel Peace Prize for writing a
Central American peace plan signed by the region's presidents in
August.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished at a

U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the day's session at
28,342.46 points, up a sharp 195.14 points or 0.69 percent.
   The dollar ranged from 125.62 yen to 125.81 yen, before closing
the week at 125.73 yen, down 0.25 yen from Thursday's finish. The
rate was, however, higher than its opening level of 125.68 yen.
   ``The dollar weakened on overnight declines abroad and
yen-buying prompted by the release of better-than-expected figures
for the Japanese economy's growth,'' said a currency dealer at a
major commercial bank.
   On Thursday, the Japanese government reported the nation's
economy grew an inflation-adjusted 2.7 percent in the first quarter
of this year, or 11.3 percent on a real annualized basis.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British judge sentenced an Arab man to 11 years
in prison for keeping a cache of explosives for the Palestine
Liberation Organization in his home.
   Judge Christopher French of Old Bailey's Central Criminal Court
told Ismael Sowan on Thursday that the sentence was the very least
he could give for his ``extremely grave offences.''
   Sowan, 28, was convicted Wednesday of storing explosives, rifles
and grenades in his home in the eastern port of Hull.
   In announcing the sentence Thursday, the judge said, ``we were
reminded ... only yesterday of the appalling use to which these
materials can be put.'' The reference was to a bombing in Northern
Ireland that killed six soldiers and wounded 10 civilians Wednesday.
   Sowan was arrested last August when police were investigating
the shooting death of an Arab cartoonist, Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami.
   Although he was arrested in Hull, Sowan's trial was held in
London at the Old Bailey court because cases involving security and
terrorism usually are tried there and because Scotland Yard had
participated in the investigation.
   Sowan testified that the weapons found in locked suitcases in
his bathroom belonged to Abder Mustapha, a known PLO guerrilla
suspected of organizing Al-Adhami's murder.
   Police said that Mustapha fled to the Middle East after
Al-Adhami was shot in the head. Sowan, a university research
assistant, is not a suspect in that crime, although he was a friend
and associate of Mustapha.
   After his arrest, Sowan claimed to be funneling information
about Mustapha to the Israeli secret service Mossad. Officials at
the Israeli Embassy in London confirmed that Sowan was in contact
with them, and that he had told them that he had Mustapha's weapons.
   British police and intelligence agencies said they did not know
about the spying operation and did not receive information from
Mossad about the weapons cache during the investigation.
   David Cocks, Sowan's defense attorney, said the Israeli factor
made his client innocent.

   Even if the United States were not the most
powerful of the West's ``Big 7'' nations, Ronald Reagan's easy
master-of-ceremonies manner would make him the natural center of
attraction at the economic summit that opens Sunday.
   That's the way it has been since Reagan's first session with the
leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany
in Montebello back in 1981.
   The new president fought hard at his first summit for
``Reaganomics'' although his tough monetary policy was a bitter
pill for some of his partners. Reagan prevailed.
   In 1983, on his home turf at Williamsburg, Va., Reagan ran into
a momentary challenge from Canada's Pierre Trudeau, who grumbled
about the muscular U.S. foreign policy and said the participants
should be working as hard as they can for peace.
   But the summiteers wound up endorsing Reagan's plan to deploy
new nuclear missiles in Europe. Trudeau backed off, and he won't be
at the table to needle the president this time.
   In 1985, in Tokyo, Reagan steered the Big 7 into a strong
statement against terrorism. Two years later, it is no longer a
controversial issue.
   One of the few hard decisions expected here is a declaration
that governments should not allow airplane hijackers to refuel. The
idea is to carry the U.S. no-place-to-hide policy a step further.
   The allies, with the exception of Britain's Margaret Thatcher,
usually are not that eager to take a militant stand against
terrorism. Reagan's biggest accomplishment in his seven economic
summits may be lining them up in Tokyo.
   But this time it may be a little different. It is Reagan's last
round with Mrs. Thatcher and the other summiteers and he is
beginning to take on the mantle of an amiable lame duck.
   He will not try to rally his democratic partners to an economic
or foreign policy crusade. The agenda is carefully scripted to
avoid controversy. And while it cannot be guaranteed to come out
that way, the 14th summit of the industrialized democracies will be
strong on conviviality and short on decisions.
   In a sense, this is a tribute to Reagan's ability to promote his
free-enterprise views as well as to America's strength.
   Japan and West Germany, bowing to U.S. pressure, are now buying
more American goods, and help to Third World debtor nations may
take the form of grants or debt forgiving, and not
government-subsidized interest rate reductions that the Reagan
administration opposes.
   For next week's summit, there is an implicit agreement to push
the host, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to center stage.
Mulroney, facing federal elections in less than 15 months, hopes to
profit politically from the summit, and discord would not be the
way to demonstrate his skills as a Western leader.
   He has pushed divisive foreign policy issues into the
background, and will try to lead the summit into a quiet discussion
of technical economic problems.
   At least one could be explosive. The United States would like to
bring down agricultural subsidies, and there could be a wrangle
with France and West Germany, which are determined to protect their
farmers.
   But this issue might be sidestepped as requiring further study,
and the three-day meeting is apt to be a pleasant closing act on
the world stage for Reagan. The biggest concern as the seven
leaders head here has nothing to do with economics or foreign
policy. It is the plague of our age: terrorism.
   The Canadian hosts are taking security precautions. Without the
proper credentials, it will be impossible to get within three city
blocks of the downtown convention center where the leaders will
meet.
   And they will hold their discussions in a windowless underground
room, presumably out of harm's way.

<HEAD>South Korea Orders Metals And Oil In First Direct Trade With China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea has ordered metals and
crude oil from China in what would be the first officially
acknowledged direct trade between the two countries, trade
officials said today.
   South Korea's Office of Supply said its officials ordered 15,000
tons of pig iron from Inner Mongolia during a recent visit to
Boutou in the northern region of China.
   The officials also negotiated for importing 3,000 tons of ingot
aluminum by August and 10,000 tons next year from Inner Mongolia,
and an order was expected to be placed soon.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
saving in shipping cost was one reason for buying from Inner
Mongolia, in addition to the government's new policy of promoting
direct trade and other economic relations with China.
   South Korea has conducted trade with China through third
parties, such as Hong Kong, because of the lack of formal ties
between the two countries.
   China backed North Korea when it invaded South Korea in 1950.
Hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops fought in the war against
the United Nations forces. Since the war China has been close to
North Korea and has had cool relations with South Korea.
   But recently, as China has opened up to the capitalist world,
relations have improved with the south.
   Last year, for example, indirect trade between the two countries
was close to $2 billion last year, according to some estimates.
   Up to now, South Korea has bought aluminum from the United
States and unspecified Eastern Europen areas, the officials said.
   In a related development, Honam Oil Refinery Co. said it has
ordered 380,000 barrels of heavy crude oil from China to be
delivered beginning late this month.
   The price was said to be 80 cents lower than the current
international level per barrel.
   Honam is a joint venture between Korean business interests and
Caltex of the United States.

   The Reagan administration's plan to conduct
random drug testing of all 13,000 federal prison workers was
blocked by a federal judge who says it ``treats innocent employees
as suspects.''
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel, whose earlier order had
blocked the program from starting as scheduled May 23, issued a
preliminary injunction Thursday rejecting the government's claims
that drug testing was justified by concerns about safety and
corruption.
   The administration will appeal the ruling immediately and ask
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let testing begin while
the appeal is pending, said Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stoll.
   The Bureau of Prisons was to have been one of the first agencies
to begin drug testing under President Reagan's September 1986
executive order for testing of federal employees in ``sensitive''
jobs. The bureau has declared that all of its workers hold
sensitive jobs.
   ``The program would force law-abiding employees of the Bureau
(of Prisons), on two hours' telephone notice, to submit to
urinalysis testing even though not suspected of any drug use nor of
any wrongdoing, negligence or dereliction of duty,'' Weigel said in
response to a suit by the American Federation of Government
Employees, the largest federal workers' union.
   ``There are cases in which compulsory drug testing may be
justified in the interest of public safety or security or the like.
This is not one. Rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States must not bend to public clamor.''
   He said the administration's stated justifications of safety,
prevention of corruption and preservation of public confidence were
unsupported by any evidence that problems in those areas had been
caused by employee drug use or would be reduced by random testing.
   While drug use in society is a serious problem, the judge said,
random testing of innocent employees, without a showing of
individual suspicion or some compelling interest of the government
as employer, is not a constitutional response.
   ``Otherwise, mass testing of the entire population of the nation
would be justified,'' Weigel said. ``And that would be the
beginning of a police state.''
   He also said urine testing was ``inherently intrusive,'' both in
the way it is conducted and in the information it can reveal, and
that it does not measure impairment in job performance.
   Unless a higher court lifts the injunction, it is binding until
the suit goes to trial.
   A lawyer for the union said the outcome is likely to be decided
by U.S. Supreme Court rulings in pending cases involving
post-accident testing of railroad workers and testing of U.S.
Customs employees seeking transfers. The court is scheduled to hear
those cases next term, which begins this fall.
   ``The war against drugs is going to have to be fought against
the people who are using drugs, and innocent Americans have the
right to be left alone,'' said the lawyer, Cliff Palefsky.
   The lawsuit contends drug testing without individual suspicion
of drug use violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable
searches and seizures. It also contends the program violates
federal laws that ban discrimination against the handicapped and
require discipline to be based on job performance.

<HEAD>NBC-Journal Poll Finds Women Give Dukakis 15-Point Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overwhelming support among women is giving
Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis a 15-point lead
over Republican George Bush, according to a recent poll.
   In an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday,
Dukakis was supported by 49 percent of the registered voters in the
poll, to 34 percent for Bush. Among men the split was 46-40 for
Dukakis, but among women his margin was 52-28.
   In another measure, the NBC-Journal poll Thursday found that
only 38 percent of women said Bush cares about people like them.
   The national survey of 2,014 adults was conducted June 9-12.
   The margin of sampling error in the telephone survey was three
percentage points.

Commission should investigate a Chicago-based group for allegedly
illegal campaign contributions, including one to Democratic
presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   The GOP committee alleged at a news conference Thursday that
Citizen Action and its affiliates in 24 states formed corporations

promoting issues solely among members by using donations to promote
specific political candidates.
   Citizen Action denied the allegations saying they were ``filled

<HEAD>Task Force: Take Time Making Vice Presidential Choices</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ A panel that included several former presidential
aides says presidential candidates should take their time deciding
who will be their running mates because the person who occupies
that office will be a hearbeat away from the White House.
   ``All too often you end up making the decision at 2 a.m.,'' said
James Cannon, a former aide to President Ford who contributed to
the task force report commissioned by the 20th Century Fund, a
non-profit research organization.
   On balance, the group, composed of aides to former Presidents
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter Thursday said the vice
presidency is a healthy if imperfect institution with the incumbent
acting as an adviser to the president and as a representive of the
United States abroad.
   But three panel members, Hugh Heclo, a professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Kennedy's
former aide, and Henry F. Reuss, former chairman of the Joint
Economic Committee, suggested the vice presidency does more harm

<HEAD>World's Longest Chain of Bonfires to Circle Continent for 200th

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Runners bearing Olympic torches will
light a chain of bonfires 10,000 miles around the continent's
coastline in a blazing tribute to Australia's bicentennial.
   Organizers said more than 750,000 Australians will be involved
Saturday in creating what they say will be the world's longest
chain of bonfires.
   ``There will also be hundreds of other fires in the outback,''
said Claudio Celiz, who originated the project. ``There is an
enormous number of other people who want to take part.''
   The fires, about 20 to 30 miles apart, will start at dusk on the
shore of Botany Bay, site of the first landing in 1788 of British
convict ships. The chain will go south to Tasmania, then back to
the mainland on a route through Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin,
down through Brisbane and back to Sydney.
   Veliz, professor of sociology at La Trobe University, said Papua
New Guinea, Kiribati and several other South Pacific island nations
were joining the celebration by lighting bonfires of their own.
   Each beacon will be lit by runners moving in relay with an
Olympic torch. Greece will darken the Acropolis in Athens and then
floodlight it as the celebration gets under way down under, Veliz
said.
   He said organizers were seeking a listing in the Guinness Book
of World Records for the longest chain of bonfires in history and
for the the biggest single bonfire ever, a 120-foot stack to be set
alight in Dover, Tasmania.

   A Bulgarian sailor completed a
162-day solo journey around the world in a 36-foot sailboat, losing
30 pounds and scarcely sleeping for the last nine days of his
voyage, a Bulgarian official said.
   Bulgarian Embassy First Secretary Gueorgui Lambov said that
Doncho Papazov, 49, reached La Plata on Wednesday night and would
undergo a medical checkup before being allowed to speak to the
press.
   Papazov, he added, ``is not in the best physical condition,''
but is in good spirits.
   The first secretary said Papazov told him he had lived on a diet
of bread and cheese and ``sea snails that he caught himself''
during the final days of the journey.
   ``He said he doesn`t want to see canned food ever again,''
Lambov said in a telephone interview.
   Lambov said Papazov's boat Tivia was severely damaged by
icebergs near Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America. He
said that after April 16, Papazov sailed without radar or automatic
pilot and with a broken rudder. Papazov battled enormous waves
which almost sunk the craft on two occasions.
   The diplomat said Papazov told him that the Tivia, which began
the journey on Dec. 29, was able to advance only a few miles in the
last few days of the journey because there was no wind.
   The boat was taken under tow by the Argentine Coast Guard after
it had passed its point of departure at the mouth of the River
Plata and was brought to the Regatta Club of La Plata, Lambov said.
   Papazov, a journalist who sailed the Tivia from Bulgaria to
Buenos Aires nearly a year ago to prepare for his journey, has
sailed over 80,000 miles since 1972 and has authored three books on
his travels, Lambov said.

<TEXT>
   An adviser to President Reagan
thanked Honduras for its support of U.S. policy in Central America,
especially in neighboring Nicaragua.
   Max Kampelman, who also is the chief U.S. arms control
negotiator, said Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government did not
appear serious about negotiating a permanent cease-fire with
U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   ``Let me say that the people and government of Honduras have
been extremely cooperative of this struggle for freedom and
democracy in Nicaragua,'' he said at a brief news conference after
a two-hour meeting with President Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   ``And I know that this has caused some difficulties and has been
a burden, and all of us who support democracy are appreciative of
the fine way in which Honduras has assumed that burden,'' Kampelman
said.
   The Honduran government has provided tacit support to the
Contras since they began their war to topple the Sandinista
government in 1981, including allowing the rebels to maintain base
camps in Honduran territory.
   But anti-U.S. sentiment flared after the forced extradition of
Juan Ramon Matta, an alleged drug trafficker, from his Tegucigalpa
home to the United States in April. The Honduran Constitution
forbids the extradition of Honduran nationals.
   A mob sacked and burned the U.S. consulate to protest the
incident and the presence of the Contras.
   Kampelman was accompanied by Morris Busby, on his 14th visit to
Honduras as special U.S. envoy to Central America, and other top
White House aides.
   The U.S. group met Wednesday with Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias in San Jose, that country's capital.
   Arias said he had urged both sides in the Nicaraguan conflict to
continue negotiating for a permament truce and ``a real
democratization'' in that country.

   Demonstrators at the Rangoon Arts and
Science University have demanded the government release detained
students, reinstate those expelled for taking part in earlier
protests and legalize student unions.
   Beginning early this week, students have held meetings and stuck
posters outlining their demands to walls at the university's main
campus.
   The students had demanded that their requests be granted by
today.
   The authoritarian regime of military strongman Ne Win was rocked
by student demonstrations last March which Western diplomats said
may have left as many as 100 dead.
   A government panel later announced that two students were shot
by riot police and 625 were arrested. A large number of these have
since been released, the government has said.
   For most of this week, student activists, mostly masked with
handkerchiefs, have protested outside classrooms of the Arts and
Science University. Teachers persuaded them to refrain from
violence.
   Attendance at classes was scant throughout the week.
   Student-led protests have erupted periodically during Ne Win's
26 years in power.
   Student unions have been banned since July 1962 after nearly 20
students were killed and more than 40 others wounded when military
units dispersed student rioters at Rangoon Arts and Science
University.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged to a new
high today, and the dollar weakened in trading against the Japanese
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed the week
at 28,342.46 points, up 195.14 points or 0.69 percent. It was the
Nikkei's third consecutive record high close, surpassing its
previous high of 28,147.32 points reached Thursday.
   ``Expectation is running high among investors that share prices
will rise further,'' an official at a major Tokyo securities house
said on condition of anonymity.
   Volume was a moderate 1.7 billion shares, up from 1.4 billion
shares Thursday.
   The market was led mainly by large-capital steels and heavy
industries, but buying was active and spread across many other
issues, he said.
   Advancing issues included textiles, papers and foodstuffs, while
some electricals and pharmaceuticals fell.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar finished the
week in sluggish trading at 125.73, down 0.25 yen from Thursday's
close. The rate was slightly higher than its opening of 125.68 yen.
   ``The dollar started lower on selling prompted by
higher-than-expected Japanese GNP figures. But it was stable the
rest of the day without new incentives to direct the market,'' said
a currency dealer at a major commercial bank, also speaking
privately.
   On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economy
grew an inflation-adjusted 2.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year, or 11.3 percent on a real annualized basis.

<HEAD>Japan Approves Science Pact With US For Summit Signing

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet today approved a science pact with the
United States to open up Japanese laboratories to American
researchers and limit the publication of joint research on
technology with possible military uses.
   The Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology will be
endorsed when President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita meet privately at the seven-nation economic summit June
20 in Toronto, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda.
   U.S. and Japanese officials finished 10 months of negotiations
with a new five-year agreement to replace a pact that was
temporarily renewed five times since it expired in 1985.
   Under the new agreement, Japan will open up its public and
private laboratories to American researchers and increase funding
for scientists and engineers coming to Japan.
   Private industry accounts for 80 percent of the funds Japan
invests in research and development, compared to 50 percent in the
United States. As a result, the U.S. government has been pushing
for more access to private laboratories where the bulk of Japanese
research takes place.
   U.S. negotiators also won a major concession in talks to renew
the pact when Japan agreed to restrict publication of sensitive
material on jointly developed technology.
   The Japanese government has come under attack for what critics
say are lax controls on exports of sensitive technology to
communist nations in violation of a Western accord.
   Last year, U.S. officials disclosed that Toshiba Machine Co., a
subsidiary of the major Japanese electronics maker Toshiba Corp.,
had been exporting submarine-silencing equipment to the Soviet
Union.
   Under the new pact, due to take effect when the current
three-month extension ends this month, both countries also agree to
protect intellectual rights and determine rights to patents arising
from joint research before the start of laboratory work.

   A group of Connecticut lawmakers say they have
drafted a bill to toughen federal construction regulations and
increase penalties against contractors to avoid accidents like the
one that killed 28 workers in their state a year ago.
   The legislators said Thursday the Occupational Safety and Health

collapse of the L'Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport, Conn., the worst
construction accident in New England history.
   ``It has been more than a year since L'Ambiance collapsed,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., the chief House sponsor.
``Tragically, we have seen little movement to change any of the
factors that contributed to the accident.''
   Shays proposal would stiffen OSHA fines, tighten accident
reporting requirements, mandate a professional engineer to oversee
construction projects, make negligent employers liable to stiff
prison terms and give the agency authority to shut down a work site
to investigate an accident.

   Five Costa Rican fishermen whose boat ran out of
gas and drifted 3,600 miles across the Pacific Ocean survived for
five months on rainwater and a diet of fish, turtles and sharks,
the Coast Guard said.
   The men aboard the 30-foot Cadiro III flagged down a Japanese
tuna boat 700 miles southeast of here Wednesday. They were in good
health, Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Crawley said Thursday.
   The men were expected to arrive here today aboard the Kinei Maru
128, which rescued the men and left their boat drifting.
   The Cadiro III set out Jan. 19 from Puntarenas, Costa Rica, for
an eight-day fishing trip, but was driven from land by a storm and
ran out of gas before it could reach port.
   ``A storm came upon us so we started heading for shore, but the
winds were too strong and they pulled us out to sea,'' Joel Omar
Gonzales, one of the fishermen, told the Coast Guard by radio. ``We
ran out of diesel and have been adrift ever since then.''
   The men collected rainwater and caught enough sealife to stay
healthy, Crawley said.
   ``We ate anything that came near our boat, such as fish, turtles
and sharks,'' Gonzalez said. ``We got water because it rained a few
days and we managed to fill a lot of empty cans we had on board our
boat.''
   Crawley identified the other sailors as captain Gerardo Obregon
Orando, George Fernandez Castillo, Pastor Lopez Rojas and Juan
Cernas Bolivar. The Coast Guard did not have the men's ages.
   Helga Richardson, the Costa Rican consul in Hawaii, said her
government told her of the missing boat soon after it disappeared.
She then alerted the Coast Guard.
   ``I never heard any more, and I forgot all about it,'' Mrs.
Richardson said.
   ``When the Coast Guard told me the boat had been found, I said,
`Impossible. Are they all dead?''' she recalled.
   Mrs. Richardson, who planned to be on hand when the men reach
Honolulu, said they would be taken to a hospital for physical
examinations.

   Tamil rebels have realized the
government has offered the best deal they can get and may soon sign
a peace accord, a Cabinet minister said today.
   The statement by Lands Minister Gamini Dissanayake added to
speculation that India and ethnic Tamil rebel leaders have agreed
in principle on a way to end the Tamils' five-year insurgency in
Sri Lanka.
   On Thursday, five people, including three policemen, were killed
in southern Sri Lanka in attacks blamed on the People's Liberation
Front.
   The group of extremists from the majority Sinhalese contends
that an agreement last year makes too many concessions to the
Tamils and has pledged to killed anyone who supports it.
   Dissanayake said today that talks between the Indian government
and Tamil separatists have reached a ``very hopeful stage'' and
could soon produce an agreement.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President
Junius R. Jayewardene signed a peace accord July 29 aimed at ending
the Tamils' guerrilla war for an independent homeland. The
agreement called for increased autonomy under regional governing
bodies.
   But the rebels rejected the pact and continued their
independence struggle. India has sent more than 50,000 troops to
the island off its southern coast to enforce the accord.
   Dissanayake, believed to be one of the authors of last year's
accord, told The Associated Press today that the rebels ``have now
realized the ... peace package offered to the Tamils under the
provincial council system of government ... is the best deal the
Tamils ever hoped to get.''
   But sources in Madras, India, who insisted on anonymity,
cautioned that several major hurdles remained.
   One Indian official said the Tamils were asking for $770,000 in
payments to help their fighters make the transition from military
to civilian life.
   The official and a Tamil rebel source, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the plan has not yet been approved by
Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
   Prabhakaran, who heads the island's strongest militia, has been
in hiding since Indian peacekeeping troops drove his men out of
their northern Jaffna Peninsula strongholds in October.
   Officials in India and Sri Lanka have said that Gandhi may fuel
progress toward a final settlement this weekend during a visit to
the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, whose state capital is
Madras.
   The officials say Gandhi may announce a temporary cease-fire to
allow talks on the pact to reach conclusion.
   Government officials in New Delhi have said that contacts are
under way but have declined further comment.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, claim they are discriminated against by
majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military.
   More than 8,500 people have died since the Tamil insurgency
began in 1983.
   India is involved because many of its own 60 million ethnic
Tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause.

   The three children of a wealthy Lebanese
jeweler were released today, three days after they were kidnapped
in Syrian-controlled Moslem west Beirut by gunmen seeking ransom
money, police said.
   It was not known whether Zuheir Ariss, owner of a plush jewelry
shop and a money exchange company, paid the $3 million that was
demanded to secure the release of his 14-year-old daughter Dana,
and two sons _ Samer, 9, and Ramzi, 5.
   A separate police report said automatic weapon clashes between
rival Palestinian guerrillas wounded seven people today, but the
exchanges in the two embattled refugee camps were markedly less
intense than those of the previous day.
   The new casualties brought the overall toll to 31 killed and 137
wounded since fighting for mastery of Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh erupted last week.
   The battles pitted guerrillas loyal to Palestine Liberation
Orgnization chairman Yasser Arafat and Syrian-backed mutineers.
   A police spokesman said two Libyan observers entered Chatilla
today to join a guerrilla force drawn from factions that were not
involved in the fighting in an effort to enforce a cease-fire. Two
other Libyans were to enter Bourj el-Barajneh later in the day.
   Libya is an ally of both Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
Assad. Its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, had played a key role in
bringing Assad and Arafat together in a reconciliation effort in
April.
   Arafat and Assad had been bitter enemies for five years, since
Syria backed a mutiny in Fatah, the PLO's mainstream faction, in
May 1983.
   Last week, Arafat's loyalists dislodged the mutineers of Col.
Saeed Mousa from the two shantytowns. Fighters of Mousa, also known
as Abu Mousa, regrouped in a Syrian-controlled area on the fringes
of the camps and mounted a counter-attack this week.
   A police spokesman said Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, the Syrian
army's intelligence chief for the Beirut area, brought Ariss' three
children to their home at 5:30 a.m.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police
regulations, said ``mediators'' from the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, ``found the three children in south Beirut and
handed them over to the Syrian forces.'' He did not elaborate.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi told The Associated Press that
the kidnappers ``have not been arrested.''
   ``The case is not closed. I insist that the kidnappers be
arrested, brought to justice and punished,'' Rassi said.
   Ariss, in a statement broadcast by the Moslem Voice of Nation
radio, expressed ``gratitude to all those who helped secure the
release of my children.''
   ``We thank God because this ordeal was brought to an end. We
thank God for the safe return of our three children,'' he said.
   Police chief Col. Issam Abu Ziki refused to say whether ransom
was paid.
   Six gunmen armed with silencer-equipped pistols grabbed Ariss'
children from the family car as they were being driven to school
Tuesday morning.
   Police said the kidnappers later telephoned Ariss and demanded a
$3 million ransom.

<HEAD>Breach Of Pentagon Computer Network Shows Security Measures Weak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hacker's success in penetrating a
non-classified Pentagon computer network and searching NASA and
Navy data banks shows security measures are failing to keep pace
with sophisticated computer systems, scientists say.
   ``It's a subject that makes (computer) people turn pale and
sweat,'' said Hal Masursky, a member of a National Academy of
Sciences subcommittee on computer security.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Thursday that one or more
hackers, or computer buffs, successfully penetrated a Defense
Department computer network the night of May 16, then examined
files at the lab, the Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland and at
least one other facility into the early hours of May 17.
   No damage was done, no data was stolen and the incident is under
investigation by the FBI and security officers from National
Aeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in Washington,
said Haskell G. O'Brien, JPL's manager of communications and
computing network services.
   The break-in shows that ``fewer people are monitoring (computer
access) than should be. More people need to keep their eyes open,''
said Cliff Stoll, a computer scientist at California's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory. ``It's unfortunately easy for people to
randomly break in.''
   The network that was breached, named ARPANET, is a
non-classified network for sharing scientific information, and is
operated by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, O'Brien said.
   Thousands of computers are connected to the network at hundreds
of U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, including
some military research facilities and other NASA offices, he added.
   ``Networking has spread like wildfire, but the security
precautions are a new art,'' said Masursky, a Flagstaff,
Ariz.-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist who worked on several
NASA space missions. ``With a hacker who is very clever, trying to
guarantee he can't access things (computers) is very difficult.''
   O'Brien said authorities don't know if the hacker operated from
the United States or abroad, although NASA suspects involvement by
the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, which has been
linked to past computer security breaches.
   ``The signature looked a little like things they do, but also
looked a little different,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, West
Germany, that he was unaware of the break-in.
   O'Brien called the incident serious because programs used to
design microcircuits could have been damaged.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said from Washington that
``there is no indication that any classified information has been
obtained by such hacker activity.''
   The break-in was the third known violation of computer security
at JPL in two years, O'Brien said, citing a previously publicized
August 1986 break-in by a West German hacker, and another last
summer, in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.
   The hacker in last month's incident first gained access to the
Pentagon network through another computer at an undisclosed
location, O'Brien said. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password
_ the name of a JPL employee _ to gain access to the lab's computer.
   The hacker then used JPL's Digital Equipment Corp. computer as a
conduit to enter another ARPANET computer at Patuxent, where
authorities noticed something was amiss and notified JPL, O'Brien
said, adding he didn't know how many other computers also were
penetrated.
   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigating
the details of this,'' he said.
   JPL spokesman George Alexander said that as soon as the break-in
was discovered, ``we pulled JPL out of the network.''
   ``Our procedures are being tightened considerably to make sure
this won't happen again,'' Alexander said.
   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-old
West German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.
military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins were
detected in August 1986 by Lawrence Berkeley officials.
   Targets included computers at JPL, the Berkeley lab and Air
Force Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.

<HEAD>Commentator Says Afghan Move Was A Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent political commentator has called the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan a mistaken use of excessive
military force that damaged the Kremlin's international prestige.
   Alexander Bovin's article in the government newspaper Izvestia
was published this week and appeared to indicate a debate within
the Kremlin's highest circles about the intelligence of the Soviet
move into Afghanistan.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the party's
leadership issued a secret circular admitting errors and
misjudgments leading to the Soviet military move into Afghanistan.
   Citing party members whom it did not identify, the newspaper
said the document implied _ without stating explicitly _ that the
original decision in 1979 to send Soviet troops to Afghanistan was
wrong.
   The report said the document, which was intended to provide
guidelines for publications on the subject, was read aloud to party
members at closed meetings in the past two weeks.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told The
Associated Press that the party had put out a report on the Afghan
intervention long ago, but he refused to discuss its contents. He
said in a telephone interview that it was a ``closed'' document.
   Nikolai V. Shishlin, a spokesman for the party's policy-making
Central Committee, said he knew nothing about any party analysis of
the Afghan intervention.
   Bovin, in Wednesday's editions of Izvestia, compared the Afghan
move to the Soviet deployment of SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe,
which was a response to NATO deployment of medium-range missiles in
Western Europe.
   ``These, in my view, are typical examples of decisions of a
subjective character, oriented toward the use of military-forceful
methods in foreign policy,'' Bovin wrote.
   He said that in both cases the Soviet Union overestimated its
means and failed to consider the ``resistance of the environment.''
   ``In both cases, we drove ourselves into a corner, created
dead-end situations, from which in the framework of the old model
of thinking, old stereotypes, there was no exit,'' the commentator
said.
   The intervention hurt the Soviet Union's international authority
and brought on moral and material damage, he said.
   ``And in Afghanistan, we paid the most expensive price _ the
price of blood.''
   The Soviet Union's more than 100,000 troops in Afghanistan began
pulling out May 15 under an international agreement signed the
month before in Geneva.
   While in Afghanistan, they faced fierce resistance from a Moslem
guerrilla, united against the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul.
   Bovin's criticism was not the first of the Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan. Oleg T. Bogomolov, a prominent economist, said in a
letter published March 16 in the weekly Literary Gazette that he
had warned the Kremlin about the dangers of sending troops into
Afghanistan.
   ``In a situation report delivered to the appropriate levels on
Jan. 20, 1980, the hopeless and detrimental aspects of that action
were stated,'' wrote Bogomolov, head of the Institute of Economics
of the World Socialist System.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has called the Soviet
involvement in Afghanistan a ``bleeding wound.'' Human rights
activist and Nobel Peace laureate Andrei D. Sakharov has also
denounced it.
   Bovin praised the ``new thinking'' in Soviet foreign policy for
ordering the withdrawal and for agreeing to scrap medium and
shorter-range nuclear missiles under a treaty Gorbachev signed in
December with President Reagan.
   Most media reports, however, have defended the intervention as a
necessary response to the plight of a friendly government.
   Soviet soldiers and hardware rolled into Afghanistan on Dec. 27,
1979, to replace one pro-Moscow leadership with another and fight a
widespread anti-Communist insurgency.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported today that no
Soviet soldiers remain along the Afghan-Pakistani border in eastern
Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Anti-Fonda Vet Wants More Than An Apology From `Hanoi Jane'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a veterans coalition
protesting actress Jane Fonda's plans to film a movie here says
he's not satisfied by her apology to veterans and their families
for her visit to Hanoi during the Vietnam War.
   Gaetano Russo said Thursday that Fonda must ``do a series of
positive acts'' beyond the television interview in which she
apologized for her 1972 visit.
   ``I was trying to help end the killing,'' Fonda said in the
interview with Barbara Walters scheduled to be broadcast tonight on
ABC's ``20-20'' news program. ``But there were times I was
thoughtless and careless about it and I'm ... very sorry that I
hurt them.''
   The 15-minute interview was taped May 31 at Fonda's home in
Santa Monica, Calif., Fonda's spokesman, Stephen Rivers, said
Thursday.
   Some veterans here and in Holyoke, Mass., referring to the
actress as ``Hanoi Jane,'' have vocally opposed her planned
appearances in those cities in August for the filming of the movie
``Union Street.''
   The veterans staged large protests in Waterbury, while the
boards of aldermen in Holyoke and nearby Chicopee, Mass., passed
resolutions in recent months declaring Fonda unwelcome in the area.
   The Rev. Edmund Nadolny, pastor of St. Vincent Ferrer Church in
nearby Naugatuck, predicted Fonda's apology will satisfy all but
those who have gained personal publicity from the anti-Fonda
protests.
   ``Most of the people I talked with wanted an apology,'' said
Nadolny, who joined several other area clergymen last month in
calling for an end to the protests. ``They didn't want vengeance as
much as an apology.''
   But Russo called the interview ``typical Fonda hogwash.''
   The retired Connecticut Army National Guard major general said
the actress was ``worried about her image.''
   Fonda must back up her words with action to win his forgiveness,
Russo said. He suggested she return to Vietnam to help in the
return of prisoners of war still unaccounted for.
   ``She's got to do a series of positive acts to make me believe
she is sincere in the apology,'' he said.
   ``20-20,'' which released a transcript of the interview
Thursday, said the segment includes a recording of Fonda's radio
broadcast from Hanoi that was uncovered in government archives,
marking the first time the broadcast will be played in the United
States.
   In it, Fonda addresses servicemen stationed on aircraft carriers
in the Gulf of Tonkin and tells them the bombs they are loading
into planes are illegal and that using the bombs ``makes one a war
criminal.''
   The program also includes shots of Fonda visiting a North
Vietnamese anti-aircraft installation, where she posed in the
gunner's seat wearing a helmet.
   Fonda became involved with the anti-war movement while living in
Paris. She visited Hanoi at a ``time when the war was supposedly
winding down, but U.S. bombing of the North was being stepped up.
Civilian areas were being hit,'' Walters said during her
introduction.
   ``Fonda said she wanted to expose this, and help end the war,''
Walters said. ``Many Americans shared her feelings, but Fonda got
most of the attention.''
   Asked about the continued bitterness over something that
happened 16 years ago, Fonda said, ``There are still festering
wounds and lot of pain, and for some I've become a lightning rod.''
   Fonda said she didn't realize at the time the effect posing with
the anti-aircraft gun would have.
   ``I know the power of images,'' she said. ``To have put myself
in a situation like that was a thoughtless and cruel thing to have
done. ... I take full responsibility for it. I was not a kid, you
know. The responsibilty is mine.''
   Fonda said she didn't feel she had been duped by the North
Vietnamese.
   ``I don't remember being led to this gun; you know, I'm a strong
woman,'' she said. ``I'm naive and I make mistakes, but ... it was
my fault that I sat there, you know.''

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Ferraro's Son to Four Months</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has sentenced John Zaccaro Jr. to
four months in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover police
officer, rejecting Geraldine Ferraro's plea that ``my son has been
punished enough.''
   Vermont District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey also ordered
Zaccaro to pay $1,500 and perform 300 hours of community service
during his sentencing Thursday. Zaccaro, 24, could have faced up to
five years and a $10,000 fine for selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine in 1986.
   Zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the
sentence. His mother, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential
nominee, said after the hearing that her son had been treated
differently than the average defendant.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. Zaccaro's attorney,
Charles Tetzlaff, had requested a suspended sentence with probation
and community service.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who had requested a
jail term, denied that he had treated the case differently.
   ``This was a case where we caught a person red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
this court to say it doesn't matter who you are, you're not going
to escape the consequences of selling cocaine in this state.''
   McCaffrey said he was at a loss to understand why Zaccaro sold
drugs, saying the only explanation he could think of was greed and
a desire for acceptance by his peers.
   ``I can't in good conscience sentence you without any time to
serve,'' the judge said. McCaffrey said that Zaccaro had grown up
with every advantage, including a good education and family support.
   McCaffrey suggested that the jail time be spent in special
Vermont corrections program that allows convicts to be kept under
house arrest with supervision by a probation officer. But Quinn
said later that Zaccaro must still be accepted into the program.
   Zaccaro's parents sat quietly and leaned forward as McCaffrey
passed sentence.
   In a hearing before McCaffrey's decision, Ferraro broke down in
tears on the stand as she described her reaction to her son's
February 1986 arrest. She was in Hawaii giving a lecture that day
and had to watch the event on television.
   ``When I got home from Hawaii, I went home and my son put his
arms around me and he cried and he said he was sorry,'' Ferraro
recalled. ``He was sorry for what he had done to us.''
   Zaccaro held his head in his hands as his mother described the
impact the case had on the family.
   Ferraro, a former New York prosecutor, criticized Quinn for
failing to allow a plea bargain.
   ``I have never had a case where people weren't interested in
discussing any sort of disposition,'' Ferraro said, adding that the
defense had ``begged and pleaded'' for an agreement.
   ``If it had been anyone else ... we would not be sitting here,''
she said. ``My son has been punished enough. I want him back. I
want him back so that we can start our lives all over again.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee's silence for the
past week over the case of Speaker Jim Wright resembles the eye of
a hurricane with political winds building around it.
   Both Democrats and Republicans have been stepping up their
rhetoric, with the GOP pushing for an independent counsel in the
case and the speaker's supporters painting that effort as pure
politics.
   Wright, D-Texas, on Thursday declined to swipe directly at
President Reagan's call for an independent counsel, saying ``I'm
going to be kinder to the president than he was to me.''
   Wright continued to proclaim his innocence, and said he had no
objection to the ethics panel hiring outside help for the probe.
   ``If the committee feels its work can be expedited by the hiring
of an outside counsel, then by all means,'' said Wright, who has
repeatedly said he is innocent.
   The ethics committee announced last week it was looking into six
allegations of possible misconduct. But it has been silent since
then, apparently contemplating in private whether to hiring an
outside counsel in the case.
   On Thursday, the Republican Study Committee, a group of
conservative members, and a group of right-wing leaders outside of
Congress each called on the ethics committee to choose an
independent counsel.
   Democrats, led by House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., came to Wright's defense.
   Foley said the president's statements showed that the charges
against the speaker were part of a GOP campaign to distract
attention from the Republicans' own ethics woes, including the
investigations of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   He pointed out that independent counsels typically are appointed
to investigate criminal cases, but there are no criminal
allegations against Wright.
   Two of the ethics accusations against Wright surround a book
publishing deal, in which Wright received 55 percent of the
royalties from a paperback published by a friend who did work on
Wright's campaigns.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said Republicans have been wrong to
claim that right authored an exemption on members' book royalty
earnings. Obey was chairman of the panel which drafted the current
ethics regulations.
   The book has earned the speaker about $55,000, with several
thousand of the 20,000 copies bought in bulk by supporters.
   One bulk buyer, Gordon MacKay, a senior vice president of The
New England life insurance company, said this week he purchased
$2,000 worth of the $5.95 paperback three years ago after Wright
declined an honorarium for speaking to a management group in Boston.
   If Wright had accepted the $2,000 as an honorarium, he would
have been required to donate the money to charity or he would have
exceeded the limit on outside income in the House rules. However,
since book royalties have no limit in the House rules, he could
keep those earnings.
   Marshall Lynam, a top aide to the speaker, said he didn't know
if Wright refused the honorarium because he was at the limit or
because he made the speech as a favor to an old friend who
represented the insurance company. He said the speaker had no
knowledge of the book purchase at the time.
   Beside the book deal, Wright is being investigated in two cases
for possibly lobbying on behalf of oil companies in which he may
have had an interest, for pressuring federal officials on behalf of
Texas bankers, and for using a condominium as his Fort Worth home
while paying only a per diem and expenses but no monthly rent.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported in today's editions that
Edwin J. Gray, the former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board said in an interview from Miami that he felt ``highly
unusual'' and heavy-handed pressure in late 1986 from Wright, who
was then-House Majority Leader over Gray's handling of several
Texas thrift institutions.
   Gray, appointed to the bank board by President Reagan in May
1983, disagreed with Wright's recent assertions that Wright acted
merely a ``go-between'' for private Texas citizens primarily at
Gray's request.
   ``This was clearly not a go-between messenger function that he
was carrying out,'' Gray said. ``Nor was it an
information-gathering function.
   ``There was no doubt in my mind, at the time these telephone
conversations took place, that what he said was intended to bring
about actions on my part as a regulator,'' he said.

   India has asked the Bhopal District Court
to block Union Carbide Corp. from reaching out-of-court settlements
in the United States with victims of the 1984 gas disaster, court
officials said today.
   The request was made Thursday at a hearing that focused on a
Union Carbide request that District Judge M.W. Deo excuse himself
from the case. Deo rejected the request.
   Union Carbide, a multinational based in Danbury, Conn., will be
given an opportunity to respond to India's request at a hearing
scheduled June 29, the officials said.
   It was unclear, however, if an Indian court could issue an
injunction blocking legal agreements reached in the United States.
   The government petition said Union Carbide was considering
settlements in the United States that would undercut the
government's $3 billion lawsuit on behalf of the gas victims.
   India has passed a law making it the sole representative of the
victims.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and thousands were injured when
lethal methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide subsidiary's
pesticide plant in this central Indian city on Dec. 3, 1984.
   ``Many other gas victims who are plaintiffs in the courts in the
U.S.A. are seeking settlement of the claim with the Union Carbide
Corp., and the (corporation) is attempting to settle the claims for
a pittance to defeat the claim in the Bhopal court,'' the
government's petition said.
   ``If the individual plaintiffs are allowed to enter into any
compromise with the (corporation) without the consent of the Union
of India, such a compromise will be invalid.''
   The damage suit was filed in India on Sept. 5, 1986, after U.S.
District Judge John Keenan ruled four months earlier that India,
not the United States, was the proper venue for the case.
   India has accused Union Carbide of negligence in the gas leak.
Union Carbide contends the plant was sabotaged.

   Former astronaut Walter Cunningham was charged
with misdemeanor assault after punching a man at a traffic light
and speeding away, authorities said.
   Van Vannerson, a bail bondsman, filed a complaint claiming
Cunningham pulled up next to him Tuesday, made an obscene gesture
and cursed him before speeding away.
   Vannerson said he later pulled his Rolls-Royce behind
Cunningham's Porsche at a traffic light and said Cunningham jumped
out, punched him in the chin through his open window, then sped off.
   Cunningham has been romantically linked with Vannerson's
estranged wife, Dot, said the former astronaut's attorney, Michael
Leebron.
   Leebron denied Cunningham made obscene gestures to Vannerson and
contended the only contact between the two men occurred after
Vannerson's car hit Cunningham's car near the attorney's office.
   ``Walt is very despondent about all this,'' Leebron said. ``He
was arrested for an assault ... that never happened.''
   Sheriff's deputies on Wednesday picked up Cunningham at his
office on the misdemeanor assault charge. He was released on his
own recognizance.
   Cunningham, who flew aboard Apollo 7 in 1968 and is now managing
general partner of a capital venture firm, is suing his wife, Lo,
for divorce. Vannerson's wife is suing Vannerson for divorce.
   Cunningham has been romantically involved with Mrs. Vannerson,
according to Leebron, who said Vannerson is making a mistake in
assuming that Cunningham stole his wife.
   ``It's really a love story,'' he said of Cunningham and Mrs.
Vannerson.

<HEAD>Congressman Mum on Report He Was Warned That Drug Money Involved
in Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Rep. Pat Swindall plans to comment
tonight on a published report he continued to pursue an $850,000
loan after being told it might be financed with drug money that he
would be helping launder, an aide says.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican whose district includes parts of
suburban Atlanta, dropped out of sight Thursday after the report in
that day's editions of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution.
   Swindall did not appear on the House floor Thursday for two
recorded votes on an agriculture appropriations bill. Aides in his
Washington office refused to disclose his whereabouts.
   ``He's just not available,'' said Jan Fujiwara, Swindall's staff
director. ``That's what I've been instructed to say.''
   She said Swindall planned to make his first public comment at a
town meeting tonight in Clarkston, Ga.
   Meanwhile Rep. Newt Gingrich, who has led the attack on House
Speaker Jim Wright, recently forcing an ethics committee probe of
the powerful Texas Democrat, said he would look into Swindall's
reported role in the alleged money-laundering scheme to determine
whether he will ask the panel to investigate his fellow Georgia
Republican.
   Gingrich, the only other Republican in Georgia's 12-member
congressional delegation, said Thursday, ``I will ask the same
lawyers who worked on the Jim Wright case to review the news
stories and the transcript, and after I receive their
recommendation, I'll decide what action to take.''
   The Atlanta newspapers reported that tapes of secretly recorded
conversations from a federal money laundering investigation show
Swindall was warned several times that the loan he was seeking
might be financed with drug money or with money skimmed from Las
Vegas, Nev., gambling casinos.
   Despite those warnings, the newspapers said Swindall indicated
on the tapes that he intended to pursue the loan as long as he
could deal only with a go-between, Charles LeChasney, who
subsequently was indicted on money laundering charges.
   Swindall, who has not been charged with any crime, has said in
previous interviews that tape recordings made during the
investigation would vindicate him.
   The newspapers said the tapes indicate Swindall ended the loan
negotiations on Sept. 26, 1987, after Michael Mullaney, an
undercover federal agent who was posing as a money broker for drug
dealers and other underworld figures, told Swindall he would have
to accept the cash loan proceeds in person and sign a receipt.
   ``In other words, if Charles wants to launder y'all's money,
fine, but I can't do that, and to sign a receipt of cash would be
to do that,'' Swindall said on tape, according to the newspapers.
   Swindall's name first surfaced publicly in connection with the
federal money laundering investigation earlier this year when it
was disclosed that an Aug. 28, 1987, meeting he had with Mullaney
at an Atlanta hotel had been videotaped by investigators.
   He was subpoeaned and testified before a federal grand jury in
February, and later said in interviews that he was attempting to
convert a construction loan on his $1.2 million home in Stone
Mountain, Ga., to permanent financing.
   He said LeChasney, an Atlanta businessman, told him his mortgage
company, Gulf Coast Mortgage, could finance the loan at favorable
rates and then sell the note to investors.
   LeChasney then introduced Swindall to Mullaney and told him,
according to Swindall, that Mullaney represented a family that had
fled Central America with money to invest.
   Swindall said in the earlier interviews that LeChasney had
assured him the money he was to borrow would not be drug money. He
said he accepted a $150,000 check from LeChasney on Sept. 25, 1987,
but returned it uncashed two days later after he said he became
concerned that LeChasney and Mullaney were trying to use him to
launder money.
   The 12 tape recordings obtained by the Atlanta newspapers were
made between Sept. 13, 1987, and Sept. 26, 1987, and involve a
meeting between Swindall, LeChasney and Mullaney in the West
Virginia resort town of White Sulphur Springs, and telephone calls
between Mullaney and Swindall and between Mullaney and LeChasney.
   During the Sept. 13, 1987, meeting, according to the tapes,
Mullaney told Swindall that the loan money probably was drug money
or money skimmed from Las Vegas casinos that Mullaney was to hide
and invest for various principals.
   ``I borrowed it for my house, of which this money is his
(LeChasney's) business, his problem and frankly I don't think it's
incumbent on me to go out and find out where XYZ Corp. gets their
money,'' Swindall said.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Five At Rally Marking Execution of 1956 Revolt
Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five dissidents were arrested after
they chanted ``Democracy'' and the name of a leader of the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt at a rally marking his execution.
   Witnesses said police arrested the five Thursday after a
peaceful morning vigil at the unmarked graves where Imre Nagy, a
leader of the October 1956 revolt, and three associates are
believed buried.
   The ceremonies marked 30 years since the official media
published a Ministry of Justice decree on June 17, 1958, announcing
they were sentenced to death.
   Calls for Nagy's rehabilitation and that of some of his
associates have become increasingly frequent.
   The 1956 revolt began Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for a new
government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. But
200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks struck Budapest Nov. 4 to
quell the uprising.
   The official MTI news agency said in a terse report that ``a
group of persons who had been active in the 1956 events'' gathered
in Budapest despite a police warning.
   The report said the men then ``tried to bring under their
influence a crowd of about 350 to 400 persons whom they had
mobilized.''
   ``Police took the necessary steps to ensure public order. In the
course of this, Sandor Racz, Gabor Demszky, Roza Hodosan, Jenoe
Nagy and Peter Egetoe were taken to the police station,'' the
report said.
   About 20 or 30 people laid flowers at the eternal flame to a
Hungarian premier executed in the abortive 1848 revolution against
Austria and stepped back into a crowd of about 400 people,
witnesses said.
   About 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent
identity checks, the witnesses said. One witness said police
charged onlookers who tried to approach the flame.
   After a half-hour, the crowd moved towards the Danube river and
then on to the nearby Hungarian television station, the witnesses
said. There, dissident Janos Kiss addressed the crowd but a witness
said the speech was drowned out by crowd chants of ``AVO'' to the
waiting police.
   The AVO was the dreaded secret police in the 1950s.
   The witness said riot police then moved in to break up the
crowd. It was not immediately clear if anybody was injured.

<HEAD>Travel Agent Angry Over Phone Book Typo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SONOMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gloria Quinan claims a typographical error
in a telephone directory scared off most of her elderly clientele
when the word erotic appeared instead of exotic to describe her
travel agency.
   ``We offer exotic travel, like tours up the Amazon, but nothing
erotic,'' she said. ``I've worked a long time to build my
professional reputation, and now I'm getting a lot of crank calls
and heavy breathers,'' said Quinan, owner of Banner Travel agency.
   ``Since the listing has appeared, this reserved, not
exceptionally outgoing person has gotten obscene calls and requests
like someone with four naked ladies wanting to know where to go''
on vacation, said attorney George Altenberg.
   Although California law generally restricts damage judgments in
such cases to the cost of the original advertisement, which in this
case Pacific Bell has refunded to Quinan, Altenberg filed a $10
million suit against the utility on Tuesday.
   Altenberg believes he can win the case in Sonoma County Superior
Court if he proves gross negligence on the part of the telephone
company.
   A spokeswoman for Pacific Bell said the company's ``Yellow
Pages'' have a 98 percent accuracy rate.
   ``But obviously we're going to have errors from time to time,''
added consumer affairs manager Marilyn Evans.
   The suit claims Quinan has suffered mental anguish and physical
distress and has suffered the loss of her reputation over the word,
which appeared in red ink emblazoned across her ad.
   Altenberg said the telephone company refused to issue stickers
with the correct ``exotic travel'' description on them to the
holders of the county directories, which were distributed in April.
   ``Her older clients, which was most of her business, want to
avoid her now,'' said Altenberg, who claimed Quinan has lost 80
percent of her business as a result of the mistake.
   ``The only calls she's getting are from people wanting erotic
travel services, which she just doesn't offer,'' Altenberg said.

<HEAD>16 Dead, 17 Injured In Communist Guerrilla Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 16 people were killed and 17
injured when Communist guerrillas attacked two villages in the
northeastern Indian state of Bihar, the United News of India
reported today.
   The attack in Bihar's Jehanabad District was the worst in the
state this year. Last September, the guerrillas were blamed for
shooting six people to death in the Jehanabad area.
   UNI said the raiders attacked the villages of Nonhi and Nagma
late Thursday night. The villages are about 30 miles south of the
state capital at Patna.
   A police posse has been sent to try to catch the attackers, UNI
said.
   The attack was blamed on the Laborer-Farmer Struggle
Organization, one of a dozen so-called Naxalite groups active in
northern and eastern India.
   The Naxalites, who take their name from the town of Naxalbari,
where the movement was founded, adhere to a Maoist ideology of
violent overthrow of oppressors.
   They have been blamed for 205 deaths in Bihar since 1983,
according to official figures. News reports and unofficial sources
put the toll at more than 450.
   The latest killings raised to at least 38 the number of deaths
blamed on Naxalite groups in Bihar since the start of the year, UNI
said.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Group Will Pursue Lawsuit Despite Boston Fair Housing
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil rights group says it will pursue a lawsuit
against the city despite the unveiling of a new plan to desegregate
about 17,000 public housing units in 69 developments operated by
the Boston Housing Authority.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
filed the suit seeking to stop the administration of Mayor Raymond
L. Flynn from engaging in discriminatory housing practices.
   On Thursday, Flynn announced an agreement with the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development to integrate the city's
public housing and find apartments for anyone who was the victim of
discrimination in the past five years.
   Despite the announcement, the Lawyer's Committee for Civil
Rights, which is handling the suit for the NAACP, plans to pursue
the case, said attorney Alan Rom, because some victims of
discrimination deserve monetary damages as well as immediate
housing.
   ``However much may have been remedied by that plan, there's
still plenty left over,'' Rom said. ``This (agreement) is not
sufficient to make whole the people who were injured by the acts of
discrimination.''
   The agreement between Flynn, the Boston Housing Authority and
HUD follows an October 1987 HUD report that found a clear pattern
of steering whites to white housing projects and isolating blacks
and other minorities in projects where their own race predominated.
   The proposal has drawn sharp responses from white neighborhoods
and civil rights groups. But the furor comes nowhere near the
tension that gripped the city in the mid-1970s, when Boston began
busing students under a court-ordered school desegregation plan.
   Flynn touched on the federal school desegregation case at a news
conference Thursday.
   ``This agreement is designed to ensure fair and equal access for
public housing throughout Boston,'' Flynn said. ``It is intended to
keep decision-making at the local level and away from a federal
court.''
   Flynn lives in the South Boston section of the city, a
predominantly white neighborhood that was the scene of racial
violence during the school desegregation years. His neighbors have
criticized him severely for his support of desegregated public
housing.
   ``I am asking the people of Boston for their personal support,''
Flynn said.
   Under the agreement, the housing authority would identify people
who have been victims of discriminatory public housing practices
and place them near the top of the priority housing list. Only
emergency cases, such as a family on the verge of homelessness,
would receive a higher priority for receiving a unit.
   Anyone passed over because of race or national origin since Oct.
1, 1983, would be considered such a victim.
   Flynn emphasized that no current resident of public housing
would be forced to move as a result of the agreement.
   Boston's housing authority is the largest in the country to
enter into an agreement to voluntarily comply with fair public
housing practices, said Robert LaPlante, HUD's regional director
for fair housing.
   A second key aspect of the plan requires HUD approval. It calls
for the housing authority to offer housing applicants a choice of
apartments from a citywide list or from an individual project. If
HUD rejects that system, the authority would have to use a
HUD-developed plan in which there would be no opportunity for an
applicant to specify a housing development.

<HEAD>Marcos Mother's Body Arrives At Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARRAT, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Ferdinand Marcos
supporters today thronged the streets to pay respects to the ousted
president's mother when her body arrived in the Marcos' hometown 44
days after her death.
   Since Josefa Edralin-Marcos died in a Manila hospital at the age
of 95, her body has become a rallying point for Marcos supporters
who want the government to allow Marcos to return from exile to
bury her.
   President Corazon Aquino, who is traveling in Europe, has
refused to allow him to return for security reasons.
   No burial date has been set for Mrs. Edralin-Marcos, who died
May 4.
   About 10,000 people welcomed the cortege as it entered this
sleepy town in Ilocos Norte province, 250 miles north of Manila.
Thousands more lined the 50-mile route from Vigan, where the body
stayed overnight, and chanted Marcos' name as the cortege passed.
   The cortege left Manila on Wednesday after a five-hour march by
thousands of Marcos supporters who shouted slogans demanding their
leader be allowed to return.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii during the February 1986 civilian-military
revolt that ended his 20-year rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Many among the crowds in Sarrat, especially older people, wept
as the province's two congressmen, several town mayors and the
provincial governor carried Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' casket from the
hearse to the living room of her former home, a two-story
Spanish-style house.
   Marcos turned the house into a museum, and the bed where he was
born 70 years ago is the main attraction.
   Original plans called for Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body to lie in
state in Sarrat, where she was born, for two days. But Marcos'
sister, Fortuna Marcos-Barba, said Wednesday that it may stay there
a week.
   The body was then to be transferred to the provincial capital,
Laoag, where it was to be kept for a day before being moved to the
nearby town of Batac for burial at an undetermined date. Mrs.
Edralin-Marcos raised her family in Batac.

   The Fire Department has suspended giving its
physical endurance test to aspiring firefighters after a man died
and eight others collapsed while taking it on a warm afternoon, a
newspaper reported today.
   Department officials would not release the name of the dead
24-year-old man, who collapsed Saturday after taking the test at
the New York Coliseum, the New York Post reported in today's
editions.
   None of the eight others was seriously injured, according to
department personnel spokeswoman Margaret Gandasegui.
   ``When several (recruits) became ill after taking the test and
had to be taken to the hospital and one subsequently died, it was
decided that we would suspend'' the test, she said. ``We're going
to take a day to compile all the facts and review everything.''
   Candidates are required to wear 40 pounds of gear as they scale
walls, carry a 145-pound dummy, break down a door and drag 400
pounds of hose.
   ``It's a simulation of the job and really should only be
attempted by those who are physically or medically fit,'' Ms.
Gandasegui said.
   The cancellation affects roughly 500 would-be firefighters who
have already passed the written test but were told Thursday they
would have to wait to go through the physical endurance test.

<HEAD>Panel: Caretakers Of AIDS Patients Should Get Flu Shots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flu shots are a good idea for AIDS victims, other
high-risk patients and those who will be taking care of them during
next year's flu season, federal health officials said.
   The recommendation by the Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee was among updated influenza information contained in
Thursday's weekly report from the Centers for Disease Control.
   The committee targeted people with immunosuppression _ or the
squelching of natural responses that produce immunity, such as what
occurs with AIDS _ as being at moderate risk of flu-related
complications, but suggested that people who care for them take
extra precautions if a flu strain is present in the community,
especially during the two-week period between the time a flu shot
is administered and the time it takes effect.
   The committee also recommended that the drug amantadine, which
has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of type-A flu
strains, be used with high-risk patients when an outbreak of
influenza A is present, CDC epidemiologist Nancy Arden said.
   ``The flu vaccine is particularly recommended for people who are
at high risk for having serious complications or dying if they get
the flu,'' she said. ``But the vaccine may not produce a higher
level of antibodies with immunosuppresive persons than with people
with a healthier immune system.''
   Physicians, nurses, family members and others who have extensive
contact with such patients could use amantadine if they have not
received an influenza vaccine, or in the interim until a vaccine
takes effect, Ms. Arden said.
   ``Amantadine is recommended for people taking care of high-risk
patients if they have not taken the vaccine,'' she said. ``Another
strategy is when influenza develops in the community, people who
haven't gotten the vaccine can go to a physician and get a
prescription for amantadine ... and that way they are protected
during the time they are developing an antibody response to the
vaccine.''
   Ms. Arden cautioned, however, that the use of amantadine is not
viable for all patients, and physicians should evaluate its use on
an individual basis.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of
Vietnam said today he would meet with representatives from
Cambodian rebel groups in talks aimed at ending the 10-year-old
civil war in Cambodia.
   Vietnam has said before it would send a representative to the
informal talks beginning July 25 in Jakarta, Indonesia, but this
was the first announcement that Thach himself would be going.
   ``There is no doubt that I will be there,'' Thach told a news
conference.
   Thach and his Thai counterpart, Siddhi Savetsila, also said the
United States and the Soviet Union should act as guarantors of any
agreement to end the conflict.
   Thach and Savetsila held separate news conferences after a
45-minute meeting today. On Thursday, they held their first talks
since July 1986.
   They reportedly discussed Vietnam's plans to withdraw 50,000
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the problem of Vietnamese refugees
and the danger that the Khmer Rouge may return to power if Vietnam
pulls all its troops out of Cambodia.
   Thailand, along with the United States and China, backs a
three-party guerrilla coalition fighting the Vietnamese in
Cambodia. The three are the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge, the
Western-leaning Khmer People's National Liberation Front and
followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded Cambodia in late
1978, driving the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge from power. The Khmer
Rouge killed millions of people during its attempt to impose
radical agrarian communism on Cambodia after it took over in 1975.
   Hanoi has promised to pull out all its forces, currently
estimated at 120,000, by 1990. The partial withdrawal of 50,000
troops is scheduled to begin June 30 and continue through the rest
of the year.
   Thach said representation at the Jakarta talks would include the
pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia under President Heng Samrin.
   He said Sihanouk, Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan and
liberation front head Son Sann would attend.
   Although the format has yet to be clearly spelled out, the four
Cambodian factions are to meet first. Other parties, such as
Vietnam, Laos and Southeast Asian countries opposed to Vietnam's
occupation of Cambodia, will join at later stages of the
discussions.
   Siddhi said Thailand would not send a representative to the
meeting and would instead wait until ``the initial meeting has
firmed up to some kind of political settlement.''
   Thach praised the informal structure of the upcoming meeting and
compared it to a cocktail party.
   ``In a cocktail party there is no fixed chair for anyone so we
can move freely. I hope for the best,'' Thach said when asked
whether he would prefer to meet any particular member of the
anti-Vietnamese coalition.
   He urged full support for the talks. ``If others are not in a
hurry they'll miss the train. And missing the train is not a happy
thing,'' he said.

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance in
moderately active European trading early today, while gold bullion
fell.
   Dealers said that closure of banks and financial markets in West
Germany for a national holiday and a lack of commercial orders
curtailed activity on European markets. They expected no major
changes in dollar rates through the session.
   Traders in Italy said the dollar's advance on the coattails of
surprisingly good U.S. April trade figures had been definitively
halted by fears of central bank intervention and the possibility
that West Germany or Japan might raise interest rates.
   Mid-morning dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday:
   _ 1.7509 West German marks, up from 1.7505
   _ 1.4555 Swiss francs, down from 1.4580
   _ 5.9050 French francs, up from 5.9005
   _ 1.9684 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9650
   _ 1,300.50 Italian lire, up from 1,299.50
   _ 1.2133 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2160
   The British pound fell to $1.7815 from $1.7900.
   In Tokyo, the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, closing
at 125.73 Japanese yen, down from 125.98 yen. In London trading
later today, the dollar traded at 125.65 yen.
   London's main bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price of
$449.80 a troy ounce, down from $452.80 late Thursday.
   Gold was bid in Zurich at $450.40, down from $452.50.

   A spacecraft carrying two Soviets and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut made a soft landing today in Soviet Central Asia, the
Tass news agency said.
   The official news agency said the craft landed about 124 miles
southeast of Dzhezkazgan, a city in Kazakhstan about 1,300 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   It said the crew was in good condition after their 10-day
mission.
   Soviet space capsules land by parachute.
   On board the Soyuz-TM series capsule are Alexander Alexandrov of
Omurtag, Bulgaria, and Viktor P. Savinkyh and Anatoly Y. Solovyov
of the Soviet Union. They blasted off June 7 from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and linked their capsule two days later
with the Soviet Union's orbiting space station Mir.
   Soviet television broadcast color shots this morning of
Alexandrov, Savinkyh and Solovyov saying goodbye to Mir's crew _
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov. Alexandrov, Savinkyh and Solovyov
were shown kissing and embracing the Mir crew members and then
entering an airlock en route to the Soyuz capsule.
   The cosmonauts performed more than 40 experiments aboard Mir
involving astronomy, medicine metallurgy and geology. Alexandrov,
36, brought to Mir several Bulgarian-made scientific devices.
   It was the first time a Bulgarian boarded a Soviet space
station. An April 1979 attempt by a Soviet-Bulgarian crew to dock
their Soyuz-33 capsule with the orbiting Soviet station Salyut-6
failed, and the mission was aborted.

<HEAD>Storms Dampen Many Parts Of The Nation As Heat Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms dampened many parts of the nation
today after storms produced large hail and high winds as a heat
wave continued elsewhere.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed early today along a cold
front from Maine to the middle Atlantic Coast and the upper Ohio
Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along the same cold front
over western Oklahoma and north-central Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed along a cold front
crossing Idaho and eastern Oregon, while storms continued over
southern South Dakota and northern Nebraska.
   On Thursday, the heat wave continued in many parts of the
nation, with readings in the low to mid-90s from the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys through central Virginia,
northern New Jersey and into New England.
   But cooler weather prevailed from the northern Plains into the
upper Great Lakes. Readings were in the 70s across much of the
region with temperatures in the 50s and 60s across northern
Minnesota and Michigan.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 114 at Buckeye, Ariz.
   Rain fell Thursday in drought-stricken sections of the nation
but provided little relief from the dry spell that is wilting
crops, stranding hundreds of river barges and endangering cattle.
   Strong thunderstorms Thursday in the middle Missouri Valley
produced severe weather in South Dakota, including golf ball-size
hail and 2{ inches of rain near Winner, and strong winds that blew
the roof off a mobile home at Butte.
   A few showers fell over southern and central Minnesota.
   Scattered thunderstorms produced high winds Thursday night in
parts of Utah. Wind gusted to 42 mph at Cedar City and 67 mph
during a thunderstorm near Delta.
   Heavier rainfall for the six-hour period ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included 1 1@3 inches at Wichita Falls, Texas, and three-quarters
of an inch at Roanoke, Va.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from New England to the Middle Atlantic States, the Tennessee
Valley and the lower Mississippi Valley to southeast Texas; widely
scattered thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening in the
mountains of the West and in western portions of the central and
southern Plains; a few showers and thunderstorms from the upper
Mississippi Valley across western Iowa to eastern Kansas; and
showers and thunderstorms widely scattered over southern Florida.
   Highs were forecast in the 80s to mid-90s across much of the
nation, except in the 60s or 70s along the Pacific Coast; the 70s
from the Great Lakes region to the northern Atlantic Coast states;
95 to about 100 over western portions of the northern Plains,
southwest Idaho, portions of Utah, southwest Texas and southern New
Mexico; and 100-114 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 34 at
Marquette, Mich., to 96 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Government troops fought
communist rebels for two hours in the southern Philippines, and 12
rebels and seven soldiers were killed, a military spokesman said
today.
   Lt. Col. Edgar Centino, spokesman for the 4th Infantry Division,
said government troops claimed they saw a white man acting as a
``military consultant'' to the insurgents during the battle
Thursday in Surigao del Sur province.
   Centino said 15 rebels and six soldiers were wounded in the
fighting, which began when troops on patrol spotted a rebel camp
near the mountain village of Diatagon, 540 miles southeast of
Manila.
   He said the soldiers fired mortar rockets onto the camp, which
was estimated to house 70 New People's Army guerrillas, and the
rebels fought back.
   The rebels belonged to a guerrilla unit led by Francisco
Navarro, a defrocked Roman Catholic priest, but the military did
not know if he was in the camp during the battle, Centino said.
   He said the troops also did not elaborate exactly what the
Caucasian ``military consultant'' was doing.
   ``Our soldiers were not certain of the nationality of the
Caucasian, but they insist he was a foreigner,'' Centino said.
   The report comes at a time of growing claims by the military
that foreigners are helping train the rebels and taking part in
raids on military detachments and other government installations.
   Last week, the military arrested a Swede and a West German on
charges they were seen taking part in a rebel raid on the town of
San Francisco on Luzon island's Quezon province last February.
   The two, Stellan Hermansson, president of the Swedish Young
Communist League, and Klaus Schmidt, a Protestant minister, have
denied the charges.

   Florida Power & Light Co. is asking customers with
dogs whether their pets' tastes include meter readers in a
high-tech effort to keep those workers in one piece.
   Questionnaires on dogs have been mailed out with this month's
power bills.
   ``We just want to know which ones are dangerous,'' John Centore,
a Dade County supervisor of 20 of Florida Power & Light's 130 meter
readers, said recently.
   Each meter reader will be equipped with a hand-held computer
containing the information from dog owners and other meter readers.
When a reader approaches a house with a protective pooch, the
computer will flash a ``dog alert'' on its screen and beep.
   The utility has already received some dog surveys back, like the
one for two pit bulls named Clint and Lady that claimed they ``will
chew your legs off up to your butt.''

to raise money for the project.
   Purchasers don't actually get a tie, just the knowledge that

   City officials are putting together a
$235,000 museum that will pay tribute to one of the most important
things in Kalamazoo County history _ celery.
   ``Celery really kind of put Kalamazoo on the map,'' said
Michigan historian Larry Massie. ``From 1890 until the 1920s, the
Kalamazoo area was one of the world leaders in the production of
celery.''
   Dutch settlers began growing celery in Kalamazoo in the early
19th century, and their success spurred celery farms in Portage,
Massie said.
   However, in the 1930s celery farming gave way to paper mills.
   Work on the museum, called the Celery Flats Interpretive Center,
is scheduled to begin in August, and is to be completed by April
1989.
   The museum will offer historic and working displays on celery
farming. Portage officials said they have gathered enough artifacts
for the center but are looking for more objects, such as celery
washers and railroad carts.
   ``It's been difficult finding items because it (celery farming)
happened so long ago and no one locally has a good collection of
artifacts,'' Clifford Mulder, an assistant to Portage City Manager
Michael Stampfler said recently.
   The project was made possible by a $100,000 grant from
Kalamazoo-based Upjohn Co.; a $100,000 donation from the Kalamazoo
Foundation; and a $25,000 grant from the state.

<HEAD>Archbishop Who Defied Communists Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese Archbishop Philippe Nguyen
Kim Dien, who defied communist attempts to control his country's
Roman Catholic Church, has died. He was 67.
   The official Vietnam News Agency, in a report monitored in
Bangkok today, said Dien died of an illness on June 8 at Cho Ray
Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. It did not give the
exact disease.
   Dien was barred from work as a priest and put under house arrest
in 1984 for urging priests not to join the Committee for Solidarity
of Patriotic Vietnamese Catholics. The state had formed the group
the previous year, and critics said it was designed to control the
church.
   The clergyman spent his last years under house arrest. Dien
continued to circulate letters among his parishioners, however, and
authorities apparently made no serious attempt to replace him.
   In 1986, cardinals and bishops from 40 countries issued a
protest letter when Vietnam barred Dien from traveling to Rome to
attend the Vatican's Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
   The Vatican said Kim was born in March 1921 in Vinh Long. The
city was a traditional center of the Catholic Church in the Mekong
River Delta in southern Vietnam.
   He was ordained in July 1947 and became a bishop in 1961, the
Vatican said. The Vatican, Vietnamese refugees and other sources
charge that after the communists came to power in 1975, they closed
seminaries, jailed priests and took other steps to systematically
repress the Catholic Church. Catholicism was identified with French
colonialism and the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government of the
Vietnam War era.
   Authorities have made some steps toward reconciliation since
pragmatist Nguyen Van Linh became Communist Party chief in December
1986.
   There are 4-5 million Catholics among Vietnam's largely Buddhist
population of about 63 million.
   A Vatican spokesman said today the Vatican has sent a telegram
to Cardinal Trinh Van Can, archbishop of Hanoi, saying that Pope
John Paul II praised Dien for his courage. The telegram was signed
by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, Vatican secretary of state.
   ``The Holy Father joins in the sorrow of the bishops and of all
the Catholic community in Vietnam,'' the telegram said. ``He
commends to the Lord the courageous pastor who faithfully testified
the Gospel in a life of untiring service for the people of God.''
   A memorial service for Dien was held Monday in Hue, where Dien
was archbishop. The Ho Chi Minh City archbishop, Nguyen Van Binh,
held a funeral service in the city two days later.
   Communist Party and government officials involved with religious
affairs attended the services.

<TEXT>
   A Paraguayan former army captain described
by human rights groups as one of Latin America's longest-held
political prisoners arrived in Madrid today to receive political
asylum.
   Napoleon Ortigoza, 56, was freed last December after serving a
25-year prison term in the 1962 slaying of army cadet Alberto
Benitez.
   He had been under house arrest since his release, but was
allowed to leave Wednesday for Argentina after spending 83 days in
the Colombian embassy in Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital.
   The Paraguayan Human Rights Commission had long demanded
Ortigoza's release, claiming his imprisonment was a flagrant
violation of the law and that he was frequently subjected to
torture.
   Both Spain and Colombia had offered him asylum.
   On Wednesday, the Paraguayan government granted Ortigoza a
safe-conduct pass to Argentina. From Buenos Aires, he flew to
Madrid.
   Ortigoza told reporters at Madrid's Barajas Airport that the
prison sentence he received was ``arbitrary and political.'' He
denied any involvement in the killing.
   At the time of his 1962 conviction, it was reported that the
cadet had uncovered a plot by Ortigoza and two other men to
overthrow President Alfredo Stroessner, 75, who has ruled Paraguay
with an iron fist since 1954.
   ``The accusation against me in the killing of Cadet Benitez was
just a pretext for setting off a chain of arrests of 20 military
officers, including me, who were opposed to military men being
involved in political activities,'' Ortigoza told reporters.
   Ortigoza said he expected to be joined soon in Madrid by his
wife, a daughter and her husband, who are in Asuncion. He has said
he hopes to work with international human rights groups.

   Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto
denounced a presidential decree imposing Islamic law and said Islam
was being used to oppress the people of Pakistan.
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq put the law, known as Shariah,
into effect Wednesday night in a televised address to the nation.
   The decree makes Islam ``the supreme law of Pakistan'' but will
not affect the rights of non-Moslems or the country's business
contracts with other nations, Zia said.
   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, said Zia had
``no right to impose his will on the people of Pakistan,''
according to a report today in the English-language Daily Muslim.
   ``Islam, like in the past, is again being used to perpetuate
oppressive rule,'' she was quoted as telling journalists Wednesday.
   ``We believe it is not the business of a caretaker government or
an individual to impose their views on the nation,'' Ms. Bhutto
said. ``Like in the past, we will resist any such move.''
   Zia, who also is chief of the army, fired his entire civilian
government May 29 and dissolved the national assembly.
   He claimed that in three years in power, they failed to enact
the Islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order.
   Zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days but
has yet to set a date.
   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years later
for complicity in a murder plot.
   After ruling eight years under martial law, Zia allowed a
civilian government to form in 1985.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, repeated her call for free elections and denied
reports that her advancing pregnancy would prevent her from
preaching the party's platform of popular socialism.
   She was married to Karachi businessman Asif Zardari last
December and is expecting her first child in December.

<HEAD>CDC: Mammograms and Follow-Up Could Cut Breast Cancer Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breast cancer screening programs that personally
review positive or suspicious mammograms could substantially reduce
the number of breast cancer deaths if used nationwide, federal
health officials said.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said in its weekly
report Thursday that breast cancer deaths would be cut dramatically
if personal follow-up examinations, like that in an inexpensive
breast cancer screening program used by the Rhode Island Department
of Health, is ``widely instituted.''
   Rhode Island Cancer Registry administrator John Fulton, who
worked with the state health department on the program, said in a
telephone interview that mammograms give patients a two- or
three-year edge on detecting small tumors before they spread, and,
when combined with a personal follow-up procedure, can save many
lives.
   ``Physical examination is a very useful technique and we
advocate its use, but we know in women from the ages of 50 and
above that mammography can actually detect cancers two to three
years before a physician can actually feel it in a breast
examination,'' he said. ``To reduce the death rate from breast
cancer, we have to increase the use of mammography.''
   The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society
both advocate the use of mammography. The study says the test has
been shown in previous research to reduce deaths from breast
cancer, the leading cause of death from malignancy among women.
   ``We would consider anything that we learned from Rhode Island's
experience as having relevance to all other states,'' said CDC
spokesman Robert Smith. ``The program is relatively new and we're
still at a stage of evaluating, but I think the early results are
encouraging.''
   The CDC said a preliminary survey of 852 Rhode Island women
about 40 years old showed only 37 percent of those responding had
gotten a mammogram in the past year, 70 percent had gotten a breast
examination from a physician, and 35 percent had done both. The
survey, conducted last October, showed 92 percent saw a physician
last year.
   The screening program _ which provides mammographies for $50, a
staff follow-up of positive, suspicious or inconclusive tests and a
review by a panel of radiologists _ could serve as a model for use
in other states, Fulton said.
   Fulton said the Rhode Island statistics for mammograms and
physical exams are higher than the national average but are far
from approaching those set for the year 2000 by National Cancer
Institute, which advocates the use of mammography and physical
examination in 80 percent of all women age 50 to 70 by that time.
   ``We believe our program will increase the number of mammograms
because we have lowered the cost and have received a lot of
physician support in the community,'' Fulton said.

<TEXT>
   The British government is
giving Northern Ireland police the power to use a revolutionary
crime-detecting technique known as genetic fingerprinting after an
IRA bombing killed six British soldiers.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out a reintroduction
of detention without trial to deal without an upsurge of violence
by the outlawed Irish Republican Army in the British province.
   British and Irish government officials, meanwhile, met in
Belfast today to discuss security in the aftermath of the IRA
bombing Wednesday that killed six off-duty soldiers in Lisburn,
seven miles southwest of Belfast.
   Mrs. Thatcher's top official in he province, Tom King,
acknowledged that a security lapse allowed IRA guerrillas to plant
a bomb on the soldiers' van while they were running in a 13-mile
charity half-marathon.
   King said the soldiers failed to check the unmarked van for
explosives and should not have left it unattended in a parking lot
while taking part in the footrace. The bomb exploded in the market
town as the soldiers were returning to their barracks.
   The seven pounds of plastic explosives used in the bomb were
thought to have been smuggled into the province from Libya, King
said.
   Ten civilians, including a 2-year-old boy and an 80-year-old
man, were injured, none seriously, authorities said. The bombing
brought this year's death toll from sectarian violence to 38, eight
this week alone.
   Claiming responsibility for the bombing, the IRA vowed to wage
``unceasing war'' against the British security forces. The
guerrilla group is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   In Parliament Thursday night, King's deputy, Northern Ireland
Minister John Stanley, said the government was giving the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the province's mainly Protestant police force,
new power to use genetic fingerprinting to fight terrorism.
   Police forces in England and Wales already use the sophisticated
technique, which matches DNA extracts found in a suspect's blood,
semen, hair or saliva with evidence found at a crime scene.
   In England and Wales, police cannot use genetic fingerprinting
without a suspect's consent, but police in Northern Ireland will be
allowed to require suspects to provide saliva samples without
consent, Stanley said. Police would take the samples with mouth
swabs.
   ``In the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland,
highlighted once again by the horrific murder of the six soldiers
yesterday, it seems to us entirely reasonable and necessary ... to
give the police the power to take a mouth swab, if necessary,
without a suspect's consent,'' Stanley said.
   Earlier Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher called the attack a ``terrible
atrocity.''
   But she rejected a lawmaker's proposal to reintroduce the policy
of internment without trial used in the 1970s to round up terrorist
suspects. Britain abandoned the policy in the face of widespread
criticism of it as a violation of civil liberties.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the possibility of allowing police to detain
suspects without trial was being kept under review, but added: ``I
would be very, very reluctant to do so.''
   The meeting of government officials in Belfast was being held
under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave the Irish Republic
a formal role in running the British province.
   It was their first meeting since March, when nine people died in
two weeks of mayhem in Belfast touched off by the shooting deaths
of three suspected IRA bombers by British commandos in Gibraltar on
March 6.
   The death toll from Wednesday's bombing was the highest since an
IRA bomb killed 11 Protestants attending a war-memorial service in
Enniskillen on Nov. 8, 1986.

   Wonder Woman, Luke Skywalker, Sherlock Holmes
and even Rocky and Bullwinkle are taking a break from their
adventures this weekend to help celebrate Superman's 50th birthday.
   A four-day International Superman Exposition opened Thursday and
was expected to attract up to 30,000 visitors. Although fans know
the Man of Steel was born on the planet Krypton, Superman has
strong ties to this city _ he was created by Clevelanders Jerry
Siegel and Joe Shuster.
   Superhero devotees have come to browse through comic books,
watch science fiction movies, and shop for memorabilia ranging from
dinosaur dolls to rare Superman prints, said Tim Gorman of
Neverending Battle Inc., which is sponsoring the event.
   Gorman said the non-profit organization was founded in 1986 to
honor Siegel and Shuster. The two men, graduates of Glenville High
School, created the material for the first Superman comic book in
June 1938.
   A copy of that book could bring more than $1,000, depending on
its condition, said Randy Poling, operator of Collector's Warehouse
in Cleveland.
   On Thursday, Gorman unveiled a 2-foot-high shining steel model
of Superman in flight, right fist thrust high in a familiar pose.
The organization plans to raise enough money to build a larger
statue and a museum in Cleveland.
   Robb Jackson came to the exposition with Starfleet, a national
organization dedicated to the much-syndicated television show
``Star Trek.'' But don't call him a Trekkie.
   ``Trekkies are more fanatical; we prefer to consider ourselves
Trekkers,'' said Jackson. He works as a police officer for Clinton
Township when he isn't wearing his uniform as Starfleet deputy
commander of the Ohio region's marine division.
   ``It's a little insanity that keeps me sane,'' said Jackson.
   Jeffrey White of Athens, Ohio, a founder of the Southeastern
Ohio Science Fiction Society, said he took time off from his job at

   A woman who lived with her family in a pickup
truck camper for five days while awaiting a liver transplant was in
critical condition today after the 12-hour operation.
   Pollie Smolenski, 26, of Hallie, Ky., received the transplant
Thursday, three days after authorities moved her into a donated
apartment.
   ``Doctors are cautiously optimistic,'' said Susan Ruth,
spokeswoman for Presbyterian-University Hospital. ``The family is
ecstatic. They are so relieved she's out of surgery and everything
went well.''
   Mrs. Smolenski suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis, an
irreversible disease caused by an accumulation of bile. She was
admitted to the hospital Wednesday morning.
   Mrs. Smolenski and her parents, Raymond and Ersley Eldrigge,
lived for five days in the camper atop their pickup, parked in a
lot on the University of Pittsburgh campus. Mrs. Smolenski's three
children remained at home with their father, who had to quit his
job in a coal mine to care for them.
   By Sunday the three were down to their last $150 and were living
on handouts from police. Campus police Officer Jesse Long reported
their plight to university officials, who housed the family in a
dormitory Sunday night.
   Sympathetic officials at National Development Corp. moved the
family into a luxury apartment Monday, saying they could stay there
as long as necessary.

   Israeli troops killed a
Palestinian and wounded 18 others today when a mob of rock-hurling
Arabs tried stop soldiers from blowing up a house in the occupied
West Bank, a hospital official said.
   The army said only five Palestinians were wounded and that two
Israeli officers also were injured by stones in violence that began
when troops entered the village of Beit Furik to demolish a house.
   A military spokesman said the army was checking on reports of a
fatality and others wounded.
   Throughout the West Bank, Israeli troops destroyed more Arab
homes overnight, bringing to 18 the number demolished or sealed in
the last 24 hours in the army's campaign to stop youths from
throwing firebombs, the army said.
   At least four of the homes belonged to alleged firebombers, the
army said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the army considered
firebombs lethal weapons and that soldiers and civilians could
respond with gunfire when firebombs were thrown.
   ``We define it as a weapon and the action against the throwers
is as if they used weapons,'' he said on Israel radio. ``Those
self-defense orders also include Israeli citizens traveling on the
roads.''
   In Beit Furik, a village five miles southeast of Nablus,
soldiers opened fire when Palestinians attacked with rocks and
bottles, said an official at Ittihad Hospital in Nablus. The
official said the troops later blew up an Arab home.
   The soldiers entered the village before dawn to destroy the home
of Ahmed Hanani, allegedly a member of a gang which killed Nablus
Mayor Zafer al-Masri in March 1986 and carried out attacks against
Israelis, the army said.
   Palestinians saw the approaching soldiers and alerted villagers,
and about 700 Arabs gathered in the streets and began throwing
stones as about 100 soldiers entered, said villager Rafaq Yusef
Masmoud, 25.
   The soldiers opened fire and the street battle lasted for about
four hours, Masmoud told The Associated Press from a bed at Nablus'
Al Ittihad Hospital, where he was being treated for gunshot wound
to his left leg.
   Masmoud said he saw about 20 villagers being detained, but the
army put the arrests at five.
   In addition to the wounded Arabs, two Israeli officers were
injured, the army spokesman said, adding that their condition was
not immediately known.
   The force opened fire ``when it was in a life-threatening
situation,'' the spokesman said.
   The dead man, identified as 24-year-old Tayseer Mlaitat, was
shot in the chest, said the hospital official.
   Of the 18 other Arabs wounded by gunfire, at least two were in
serious condition, the hospital said, adding that three others were
injured by rubber bullets and beatings.
   
   The death brings to 209 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab uprising began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Two
Israelis also have died, including a teen-age girl accidentally
shot by a Jewish guard during a clash with Palestinian villagers.
   Rabin, in his radio interview, said the uprising was widespread
and supported by a majority of the 1.5 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands.
   Rabin said the army's actions were now aimed at preventing a
return to the widespread, violent protests that characterized the
early stages of the Arab revolt. Lately, the uprising has consisted
mostly of commercial strikes, fires blamed on Palestinian arsonists
and clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths.
   The army said eight homes were destroyed and 10 sealed in the
West Bank in 24 hours ending this morning. Most of the houses
belonged to Arabs suspected of hurling firebombs or planning
attacks against Israelis, but two belonged to alleged members of a
gang suspected of killing al-Masri, a spokesman said.
   ``I have eight children at home and now they want to throw me to
the street ... because my son made a firebomb,'' one homeowner,
identified only as the father of Omad Mahmoud Shalabiye, said on
Israel radio. ``I don't know what he does. He's 18 years old.''
   On Thursday, a 33-year-old woman was severely injured in the eye
by a rock hurled at her train as it passed through Acre, a town
where many Arab Israelis live, Israel radio said.
   Four Bedouins were arrested in the stoning, the radio said. But
it quoted Galilee police chief Yakov Ganot as saying he was
uncertain if the motive was nationalistic or criminal.
   The city of Nablus remained under curfew today, a day after an
Israeli soldier was shot and slightly wounded by an unidentified
assailant.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only house Abraham Lincoln ever
owned has been reopened to tourists after a $2.2 million renovation
to erase the wear-and-tear caused by a half-million visitors a year.
   The two-story brown frame house that Lincoln bought in 1844 had
been closed for about a year to complete the remaining structural
and cosmetic repairs of a three-year restoration project. It was
reopened Thursday in a celebration featuring speeches by state
officials, patriotic music and the swearing-in of 112 new U.S.
citizens.
   Gov. James R. Thompson told the estimated 2,500 people at the
ceremony he hoped that tourists who visited the home would be
inspired to learn more about Lincoln.
   President Reagan, in a congratulatory letter, wrote: ``I have
always been proud of the fact that I share Illinois roots with our
16th president.''
   During the restoration project, historians and architects
researched such details as the house's original wallpaper patterns,
the precise shade of brown on the exterior and whether the woodwork
was stained, varnished or painted.
   The results of the historical sleuthing may be a bit jarring to
modern tastes. Patterns of carpet and wallpaper are extremely vivid
and no effort seems to have been made to coordinate colors.
   Bill Brown, historic furnishings curator for the pak service,
explained that the period preference for bright colors was based on
the fact that aniline dyes were just starting to be commonly used
in 1851.
   ``It was the first time they could make bright colors cheaply,''
Brown said. ``For the first time in the history of mankind, the
average person could afford to buy bright colors.''
   About 65 of the more than 300 furnishings in the home have been
documented as original Lincoln items, including a set of chairs,
two black horsehair sofas, and a pier table.
   Thursday was also the 130th anniversary of Lincoln's famed
``House Divided'' speech.
   ``Rather than divided we are united by the affection, indeed the
love, we feel for this man and what he did for our state and our
nation,'' Thompson said.

   A federal judge sentenced two former top
executives of the Beech-Nut Nutritional Corp. to a year and a day
in prison for distributing millions of jars of bogus apple juice
intended for babies.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt also fined Neils Hoyvald,
Beech-Nut's former president and chief executive officer, and John
Lavery, its former vice president, $100,000 apiece Thursday.
   The case, one of the largest consumer fraud prosecutions of its
kind, involved the intentional shipment of adulterated, misbranded
juice to 20 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and five
foreign countries between 1978 and 1982.
   In federal indictments, Beech-Nut and the two executives were
accused of shipping 5 million jars of the bogus juice.
   ``The fraud was too extensive and too involved to go
unpunished,'' Platt said before passing sentence. ``I have no
alternative than to do what I am going to do.''
   The judge also ordered Hoyvald, 54, and Lavery, 56, to pay court
costs, estimated to run into tens of thousands of dollars, and a
special assessment of $50 for each of the hundreds of counts on
which they were convicted.
   The two men, who are free on bail pending appeal, have been on
full paid leave from Beech-Nut, according to a company spokesman.
Court documents show Hoyvald received an annual salary of $165,000
and Lavery $82,000.
   The company, which was also charged in the case, pleaded guilty
in November to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug laws
and agreed to pay a $2 million fine.
   The juice, labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies, was
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no
apple juice. No evidence was presented that the phony juice caused
health problems.
   Fort Washington, Pa.-based Beech-Nut, a subsidary of Nestle S.A.
of Switzerland, is the nation's second-largest baby food maker
after Gerber Products Co.
   A jury convicted Hoyvald, of Lebanon, N.J., in February of 358
counts of violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count
carried a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $10,000
fine.
   Lavery, of Schenectady, who oversaw the upstate plant where the
juice was made, was convicted of conspiracy, 18 counts of mail
fraud and 429 counts of violating food and drug laws. Conspiracy
and mail fraud carry maximum sentences of five years.
   Beech-Nut's current president, Richard C. Theurer, said in a
statement Thursday that the company had invested $10 million in the
past five years to ensure product quality.
   ``Our products on the supermarket shelves today are pure,''
Theurer said. ``We know this because we test them every day.''
   In May 1987, Beech-Nut settled a class-action suit involving the
phony juice that was filed in federal court in Philadelphia. The
company agreed to set up a $5 million cash fund for consumers and
to provide $2.5 million in Beech-Nut and affiliated products to
retailers.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, talking tough on crime,
told police recruits today that as president he would ``provide you
with the kind of leadership you must have from the top.''
   Dukakis, on a Southern campaign swing challenging George Bush's
claim to support in the region, also received the backing of a
group of law enforcement officials that included the Democratic
attorneys general of Florida, California, Louisiana and Michigan.
   Meeting with the group, which also included police chiefs,
sheriffs, district attorneys and members of private anti-crime
organizations, Dukakis outlined his plan for a national crime
council patterned after the stte council he formed in Massachusetts.
   He began his day at the flag-raising ceremony at the Southeast
Florida Institute of Criminal Justice.
   It provided a symbolic response to criticism from the Bush
campaign of his veto, a decade ago, of legislation that would have
required the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag in
Massachusetts schools.
   Dukakis vetoed the bill after the state supreme court advised
him it was unconstitutional.
   Bush has begun raising the veto and saying he favors recitation
of the pledge ``anywhere and everywhere.''
   Dukakis told the police trainees they would be leading the fight
to ``provide all Americans with the kind of safety and security
they're entitled to have in their homes and in their communities
and in their neighborhoods.''
   He said, ``I'm going to do everything I can to provide you with
the kind of leadership you must have from the top ... to provide
you with the support and the resources and the training you need.
   Dukakis opened a his three-day Southern campaign swing on
Thursday and talked about drugs with high school students in South
Carolina. He planned to continue sounding that theme in an
appearance before Mississippi municipal officials.
   No region of the country backed Republican President Reagan more
solidly than the South, and his vice president hopes to capitalize
on that popularity in the fall presidential campaign.
   But Democrats see it differently.
   ``Anybody who thinks George Bush has the kind of appeal Ronald
Reagan had in the South is going to be sadly mistaken,'' Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Thursday as he endorsed Dukakis for the
presidency.
   Gore, who dropped his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination last April after his disappointing finish in the New
York primary, predicted Dukakis would carry five or six Southern
states.
   ``The kind of candidacy Mike Dukakis brings to the South today
is very different from what Republicans were licking their chops
over early in the campaign,'' said Gore. ``They know now they have
their hands full.''
   A new survey by Atlanta pollster Claibourne Darden appeared to
support Gore's assessment.
   Darden's poll of 750 voters in nine Southern states said 45.1
percent favored Dukakis while 42.3 percent backed Bush. With a
margin of error of 3.6 percent, the survey amounted to a dead heat
in the region where Bush virtually clinched the Republican
presidential nomination.
   The vice president swept the Southern primaries on March 8,
Super Tuesday, and broke the back of his competition for the GOP
nomination.
   While Dukakis won the primaries in the two biggest Southern
states on Super Tuesday _ Texas and Florida _ he never campaigned
in several other states in the region.
   The Massachusetts governor was campaigning for the first time in
Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee.
   ``We aren't going to concede one single state in this country
... and that means the states of the South,'' Dukakis said as he
accepted Gore's endorsement.
   ``They're open, they're ready for new leadership,'' he said of
the Southern states.
   A potential trouble spot for the Democrats in the fall campaign
was raised when Dukakis was asked whether he would support the call
for an independent counsel to investigate allegations against
Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   Dukakis replied that he understood Wright ``welcomed'' the
independent counsel, adding: ``His attitude about this contrasts
rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling we've had from the
administration in case after case.''
   The Massachusetts governor was asked if he was concerned abput
the possibility Wright would be under investigation when he was
scheduled to be presiding over the Democratic National Convention.
   ``I thought there was a presumption of innocence in this
country,'' replied Dukakis.
   Dukakis was asked about his call for the resignation of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III _ something he has not urged Wright to do.
   His call for Meese to quit, Dukakis said, came ``after repeated
evidence of insensitivity, a lack of awareness of what we mean when
we talk about high standards.''
   ``If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided
as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office,'' he said.

   Freed rapist Larry Singleton is not living in
Tampa, his brother says, but word that Singleton gave authorities
his brother's address here was enough to stir up a campaign to run
him out of town.
   A total of $10,000 and a one-way ticket out of Florida were
offered Thursday by a Bradenton car dealer and St. Petersburg radio
station if the 60-year-old former merchant seaman would pack up and
leave.
   Singleton spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in California
for raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping off her forearms with
an ax and leaving her for dead in a ditch southeast of San
Francisco in 1978. His parole ended in April.
   There was no response to the offers from Singleton, who earlier
in the week had listed his brother Walter's Tampa address with
state officials. But a neighbor said he was told by Walter
Singleton that his brother is living in seclusion 2{ hours from
Tampa.
   The brother wouldn't disclose the location, according to Phil
Scalera, adding that Walter Singleton invited 10 neighbors in to
his home to look around but they declined.
   ``We talked to Walter Singleton, and he was rather belligerent
about it,'' Scalera said. ``But he said he isn't staying there. ..
. He said: `I can't help it that he used my address. It's my
father's fault that he's my brother.'''
   Singleton, as a felon, had to register an address with the state
to move to Florida, but authorities said the address didn't have to
be his residence.
   Although law enforcement officers say Singleton cannot be barred
from living in Florida, businessman Tom Stimus wants Singleton to
feel unwelcome.
   Stimus, who has three car and truck dealerships in the area,
placed a full-page ad in the Bradenton Herald on Thursday that
read: ``An Open Letter To Larry Singleton, Take this $5,000 and get
out of Florida.''
   He also volunteered to pay rent and utilities for six months for
Singleton at a new address out-of-state.
   Stimus, 49, has previously offered rewards for the assassination
of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,
with no takers.
   Meanwhile, WQYK-FM matched Stimus' $5,000 offer after 99 percent
of the listeners responding to an on-air poll said they wanted
Singleton to leave, said station spokeswoman Diana Thomas.
   California officials seeking to place Singleton during his
parole were met by community protests, and local law enforcement
officials said they feared they could not guarantee his safety.
   Singleton finally served his parole time while living in a
mobile home within the gates of San Quentin state prison.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS headline, lead to clarify that orchestra is seeking to
reorganize</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nashville Symphony Association has
filed for Chapter 11 reorganization after almost five months of
struggling with its musicians to solve money problems.
   The Music City's 85-member orchestra shut down Feb. 3 because of
financial trouble, and since then a task force of board members and
musicians have wrangled over cost-cutting plans to keep the
symphony alive.
   The board said last week it would file for reorganization under
federal bankruptcy law if it failed to reach a last-minute
agreement with the musicians' union.
   Attorney C. Kinian Cosner Jr., who filed the petition Thursday,
said it will be followed within 15 days by a more detailed
accounting of the orchestra's finances.
   ``The major asset is the endowment of the symphony,
approximately $1 million,'' Cosner said. ``Any reorganization plan
will be funded by the income from that endowment. The purpose of
this filing is to effectuate an orderly liquidation and payment of
the claims under court supervision.''
   The filing of a bankruptcy petition protects the symphony from
its creditors until a reorganization plan can be devised. The
symphony has no plans for future performances, Cosner said.

   Rain fell in drought-stricken sections of the nation but
provided little relief today from the dry spell parching crops,
stranding hundreds of river barges and threatening to ruin cattle
farmers, including owners of a 106-year-old Texas ranch.
   ``If we get rain, there'll be no problem. If we don't get rain,
we're going to have to cut short on groceries,'' cattle farmer Tim
Meister of Reedsburg, Wis., said Thursday at the Milwaukee
Stockyards as livestock went on the block amid the worst drought in
America's midsection since the Dust Bowl.
   U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng allowed
hay-cutting on land in nearly 300 counties in 13 states set aside
under a massive federal conservation program so farmers can harvest
hay in areas where the weather has shriveled livestock feed.
President Reagan appointed an interagency committee to deal with
the crisis.
   Showers and thunderstorms moved through the Midwest and from
Ohio to Kentucky and the southern Appalachians on Thursday, but
rainfall was spotty, the National Weather Service said.
   Rain continued early today in southern South Dakota and northern
Nebraska. Showers and thunderstorms were expected from eastern
Texas and eastern Oklahoma to North Carolina up to Maine, and from
eastern Kansas to Minnesota, but the storms will be ``pretty widely
scattered,'' meteorologist Hugh Crowther of the weather service's
National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., said
today.
   The five-day outlook is ``pretty dry,'' Crowther said.
   The dry weather has shriveled or threatened to damage corn and
other crops in many states in the Midwest and the Southeast.
   `There ain't gonna be no crops. It's the worst I've seen since
'36,'' said Firmin Rettinghauf, 72, whose three sons farm his land
near Gilbertville in northeast Iowa.
   ``There is no more hopeless or helpless feeling than seeing your
crops dry up, because there is no alleviating that disaster,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who grew up on a farm, and
spoke at Lyng's news conference.
   Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture Jim Buck Ross said he
was organizing a day of prayer for Sunday.
   Dropping water levels in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers have
made the waterways unnavigable, hurting the inland shipping
industry.
   The Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the Mississippi near
Greenville, Miss., to clear the channel to the 9-foot minimum depth
needed for river traffic and to allow about 750 backed-up barges to
move, Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Michael Logue said in
Vicksburg.
   A seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill.,
remained closed to all traffic Thursday while a dredge deepened a
shallow channel. Dozens of towboats and barges were stranded.
   State officials offered some relief to struggling farmers. In
Indiana, $10 million in emergency low-interest loans was made
available, and as many as 45,000 farmers could benefit, said Lt.
Gov. John M. Mutz. In Madison, Wis., the Legislature's Joint
Finance Committee approved $5 million expected to provide 385 loans
to drought-stricken growers.
   Cattle farmers were among the hardest hit. The dry, hot weather
has turned pastures brown, burning up feed for livestock.
   ``Other years, they've been able to buy hay from farmers in
other parts of the state or neighboring states because the drought
was isolated. But this year, everybody's got the same problem,''
Michigan agriculture department Director Paul Kindinger said during
a tour of drought-hit farms.
   In the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, ranchers short on feed
had been using propane torches to remove thorns from prickly pear
cactus so cattle could graze on them. But some had to stop because
even the cactus is shriveling up.
   Near Lubbock, George McNeil said the dry spell could doom the
ranch his family has owned for 106 years, which has been plagued by
early frosts and other problems for several years. McNeill said
that if it doesn't rain soon, he'll start selling off his 500 head
of cattle in 100-head increments.
   ``We just hope that we can salvage enough cattle to have a basis
to start over again when this thing (drought) does break,'' he
said. ``But it looks like this is the one that's going to take us
out.''
   Lyng on Thursday opened up for hay-cutting land set aside under
the Conservation Reserve Program in all 53 North Dakota counties,
and more than 240 counties in a dozen other states. The program,
launched in 1985, was supposed to have kept highly erodible land
out of production for 10 years.
   Other states given permission to cut hay were Alabama,
California, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Montana, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

   Drunken English soccer fans sang
``God Save the Queen'' as they smashed taverns and fought German
pub patrons early today. Police found the body of an Irish fan
floating in the Main River.
   In Britain, the government proposed a crackdown on soccer
hooliganism.
   Police said there was no immediate indication of foul play in
the death of the soccer fan, who was identified only as a
29-year-old resident of Dublin. The victim apparently drowned while
intoxicated, they said.
   Authorities earlier had said the fan was English and that his
body was found today. A police spokesman, Karl-Heinz Wagner, later
said the body was found Thursday night and apparently had been in
the river for two days.
   Before sunrise today, roving groups of English rowdies
overturned cars, smashed windows and furniture in several Frankfurt
bars, and attacked Germans inside and outside the pubs.
   Ten English soccer fans and a West German were arrested in the
violence that broke out in Frankfurt's ``Apple Wine'' district and
near the city's main train station.
   Several people were slightly injured in the clashes, including
three police officers, authorities said.
   Frankfurt police were bracing for more trouble as fans gather
for Saturday's European Soccer Championship match between England
and the Soviet Union.
   Officials said more than 1,400 police eofficers will be deployed
in the city starting tonight.
   In London, the British government proposed barring England's
national team from the World Cup, the Olympics and other
international events after a ``soccer summit'' Thursday at Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 Downing Street home.
   ``We were all appalled by what has happened in Germany,'' said
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. ``We were clear that present
arrangements are not enough and have got to be strengthened.''
   England's Football Association on Thursday withdrew its
application for readmission to European club soccer tournaments
next season.
   ``It is a victory for the hooligan,'' said Gordon Taylor,
Secretary of the players' union, the Professional Football
Association.
   English clubs were banned from competing in Europe after 39
people were killed in a rampage by Liverpool fans at Heysel Stadium
in Brussels, Belgium, before the European Cup final in May 1985.
Most of the victims were fans of Juventus, from Turin, Italy.
   Hurd also proposed travel restrictions on fans involved in
violence, tighter controls over who gets into matches, stepped-up
police surveillance and tougher licensing laws outside soccer
stadiums to cut down drunkenness before and after matches.
   But Herbert Schnoor, interior minister for North-Rhine
Westphalia state, said West Germans, not English fans, were the
initiators of violence on Tuesday and Wednesday in Duesseldorf.
   ``These (German) hooligans were not soccer fans, but just thugs
who could not stomach the thought that English fans had a
reputation for being more brutal than themselves,'' Schnoor said in
a radio interview.
   About 22,000 Dutch and 8,500 English fans jammed into
Duesseldorf for the Wednesday night match, in which Holland
defeated England 3-1.
   Police said 371 people were arrested during the two days of
violence in Duesseldorf, with the clashes ending late Wednesday
night. Of those, 18 were English fans and most of the rest were
West Germans, police said.
   Schnoor's ministry also announced that the cost of the massive
police deployment in Duesseldorf for the soccer game was about
$900,000.
   Federal border police said they seized hundreds of truncheons,
knives, whips, chains, baseball bats, fireworks and other potential
weapons from fans entering West Germany for the series of
championship games.

   Alabama's state NAACP president says he
is innocent of charges that he accepted at least $15,000 in cash
and restaurant equipment to get a convicted murderer out of prison.
   State Rep. Thomas Reed was named in a five-count indictment
returned by a federal grand jury Thursday, the same day a
Montgomery County grand jury began investigating him and the entire
state parole system. The county grand jury has not announced any
charges.
   Reed said through a spokesman that he would have no comment on
the indictment other than to say he is innocent.
   Reed, 60, will remain free until his arraignment June 28, said
U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson.
   Reed, a longtime leader of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, was one of 14 black state
legislators arrested Feb. 2 when they tried to scale a fence around
the state Capitol to remove a Confederate battle flag that flies
from the dome.
   The indictment accuses Reed of accepting $10,000 in cash and
between $5,000 and $10,000 worth of restaurant equipment from the
family of convicted murderer Anthony Dennis Chesser.
   In return, the indictment alleges, Reed was supposed to use his
position as a state representative from Tuskegee and a member of
the Legislature's Joint Prison Committee to get the state
Department of Corrections to place Chesser on work-release and to
get the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to move up his date for
parole consideration by 5{ years.
   The parole board did move Chesser's parole consideration date
up, to 1989, but later revoked that action and an uncle of the
inmate, Bobby Gene Chesser, demanded the money back from Reed, the
federal prosecutor said.
   Anthony Chesser was convicted of murder in Russell County in
1984 for the death of his wife. He is serving a 40-year sentence.
   The indictment parallels charges Wilson filed against Reed on
May 25.
   The indictment charges Reed with two counts of violating the
Hobbs Act through extortion and three counts of violating the
Interstate Travel Act by using the highways between Tuskegee and
Columbus, Ga., as well as an interstate telephone call to obtain
$10,000 in cash from Chesser's parents, Woodson and Jessie Lee
Chesser of Columbus, Ga. The indictment contends the money was
delivered by Bobby Gene Chesser, of Columbus, Ga.
   Bobby Gene Chesser, who has cooperated with the federal
investigation, supplied Reed with restaurant equipment from his
Columbus business, Southern Store and Restaurant Equipment Co.,
according to the indictment. Reed has several business interests,
including a restaurant.
   If convicted of violating the Hobbs Act, Reed could get a
maximum punishment of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each count. A violation of the Interstate Travel Act can bring a
five-year sentence and a $250,000 fine on each count.

   The Fat Boys, the rotund rap trio, have sued
Miller Brewing Co. for $5 million over a TV commercial in which
comedian Joe Piscopo and three heavyweight partners rap a song
touting Miller beer.
   The federal suit filed Monday claims the ad takes advantage of
their platinum-selling record success and infringes on the Fat
Boys' trademark. They also claim the commercial's music ``contains
a melody copied from (and) derived from'' the Fat Boys' music.
   The portly plaintiffs are Mark Morales (better known as ``Prince
Markie Dee''), Damon Wimbley (aka ``Kool Rock Ski'') and Darren
Robinson (``The Human Beat Box''), along with the group's record
company and music publisher. They also seek the withdrawal of the
commercial.
   The ad agency behind the commercial, Backer & Spielvogel Inc. of
Manhattan, declined to comment. Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for
Miller, said today the Milwaukee-based brewing company had not yet
seen a copy of the suit and so had no immediate comment.

<HEAD>Trotsky's Stock Rises Under Glastnost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leon Trotsky, the revolutionary reviled for more
than a half-century as a Soviet traitor and enemy of socialism,
should be exonerated of criminal charges and his works reprinted, a
historian said today.
   The call for a new look at Trotsky by Yuri N. Afanasyev, rector
of the State Institute on Historical Archives, runs counter to a
central tenet of Soviet orthodoxy that has stood unchallenged for
more than 50 years.
   It was one of the boldest suggestions to date under Communist
Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or
openness.
   Under glasnost, the Soviets are taking an increasingly negative
view of the 29-year rule of dictator Josef Stalin. The Soviets also
are exonerating Communists who were branded traitors under Stalin
and killed, imprisoned or exiled.
   By acknowleging that Trotsky was falsely accused of treason, the
Kremlin would further discredit Stalin, who Gorbachev has blamed
for brutal and bloody political terror and choking the development
of socialist democracy.
   ``We have to rehabilitate all those people who were repressed
and who were accused on false evidence, and all those accused must
be rehabilitated,'' Afanasyev told a news conference sponsored by
the government. ``And in line with those people is Trotsky.''
   Afanasyev noted that cleansing Trotsky's judicial record did not
mean an endorsement of his ideas, but even putting Trotsky on an
equal legal footing with other Stalin foes would be a startling
novelty.
   Born Lev D. Bronstein, the son of a prosperous Jewish farmer,
Trotsky was a central figure in the 1917 Russian Revolution and
architect of the Red Army's victory over counterrevolutionaries in
the Russian Civil War
   He served successively as commissar for foreign affairs and for
war, but was bested by Stalin in Kremlin infighting following the
death of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin in 1924, and was forced out
of the Communist Party in 1927.
   Two years later, Trotsky was expelled from the Soviet Union and
later accused of heading an anti-Soviet plot. He was murdered in
Mexico City in 1940, reportedly by a Soviet agent.
   Under Stalin, Trotsky became an official ``non-person.'' His
role in the Soviet revolution was wiped from the historical record,
and his more radical brand of revolution was branded as heresy and
a betrayal of Lenin's legacy.
   In a major speech Nov. 2, Gorbachev continued the official
condemnation of Trotsky, saying nothing about his role in the
Bolshevik Revolution and attacking his character and ideas.
   Trotsky had advocated using the Soviet revolution as a
springboard to spread working-class revolt to other countries, and
opposed Stalin's program to build ``socialism in one country''
first.
   Afanasyev told reporters today that there may be room soon for a
reassessment of the ideas of Trotsky and other Stalin foes.
   Asked if the works of Trotsky, Stalin and former Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev may be republished soon following a long ban,
Afanasyev answered:
   ``I can speak on behalf on myself and think they should be
republished and accessible for all... I think it's very strange
when professors and teachers try to criticize Trotsky while they
haven't read a single word by Trotsky.''
   Afanasyev is a prominent advocate of Gorbachev's reform drive
who was chosen as a delegate to this month's nationwide Communist
Party conference.
   On Monday, the Soviet Supreme Court lifted the convictions
against three prominent Stalin foes, Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev
and Karl Radek. Kamenev and Zinoviev initially sided with Stalin
against Trotsky, but then backed Trotsky. Both were executed
following a trial for treason in 1936.
   In February, the court exonerated Nikolai A. Bukharin, another
Communist executed under Stalin whose more moderate economic
policies are very similar to what Gorbachev is now pursuing.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Diet Is Chief Cause of Sudden Death Among
Southeast Asian Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diet high in vitamin-deficient white rice
is a primary cause of a disease that kills otherwise healthy
Southeast Asian men in their sleep, according to a researcher who
spent three years studying the ailment.
   Ronald Munger, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of
Minnesota's division of epidemiology, said Thursday his studies
show that stress is not the leading cause of Sudden Unexpected
Death Syndrome, as some experts believe. He proposed, instead, that
it results mainly from thiamine deficiency.
   Munger presented his findings to a conference of the Society for
Epidemiologic Research in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   SUDS is the leading cause of death for Southeast Asian refugee
men ages 25 to 44 during their first few years in the United
States. The disease has claimed 117 Southeast Asian refugees since
1977, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Nearly all died in their sleep.
   Although researchers know the immediate cause of SUDS is an
electrical instability of the heart, they don't know what causes
the instability.
   The most common theory is that the deaths are caused mainly by
stress related to immigration and culture shock. Other possible
explanations are heart abnormalities or genetic predisposition
among Southeast Asians.
   Munger said he believes all those factors may play a part in
SUDS, but he places the main blame on the staple of the Southeast
Asian diet, white rice, which is a poor source of vitamins.
   Brown or unmilled rice is a good source of vitamins,
particularly thiamine, but few Southeast Asians eat it because it's
not considered socially acceptable. Eighty percent of the thiamine
is lost in the milling process that produces white rice. Thiamine,
also known as vitamin B1, is essential to normal nerve function and
metabolism of carbohydrates.
   For his study, Munger gathered electrocardiographs from 80
refugee men in Thailand in 1985 and 40 refugee men in Minnesota
over the last two years. He found ECG abnormalities occurred among
culturally and genetically diverse groups, including Japanese,
Filipinos, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians and Hmong.
   But some researchers doubt Munger's theory.
   ``The thing I wonder a bit about his hypothesis is that it's so
different from what is usually seen in thiamine deficiency,'' said
Dr. Gib Parrish, a medical epidemiologist and pathologist at the
CDC.
   Thiamine deficiency often causes inflammation and degeneration
of the nerves, digestive system and heart. Those also are symptoms
of the disease beriberi, which is caused by a thiamine deficiency.
However, most SUDS victims appear normal before dying.
   Munger said he's suggesting that there are undocumented effects
of thiamine deficiency.

<HEAD>Workers March on Parliament to Protest Reduced Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 strikers from an
agricultural machinery plant marched on the Yugoslav parliament
today to protest reduced wages.
   The workers of the Zmaj tractor factory in the Belgrade
industrial suburb of Zemun rallied in front of the parliament
building demanding to meet with government officials to air their
grievances. A delegation of the strikers was admitted into the
building for talks.
   ``We want changes!'' the strikers shouted as they crowded the
staircase leading up to the classical domed building. The
protesters carried national and Communist Party flags.
   As they filed through downtown Belgrade, the workers chanted
``Down with bureaucracy. More bread!'' and ``We want better lives!''
   Heavy police reinforements were called in to cordon off
passers-by from joining the strikers.For the first time, activists
of the official trade union joined the marchers, the Tanjug news
agency said.
   Yugoslavia, with a large foreign debt, launched a severe
austerity program that links wages to productivity. Many companies
cut workers pay as a result.
   Wages at the tractor factory were cut 9 percent in April and
another 4 percent in May.
   Yugoslavia owes $21 billion to Western creditors, and living
standards have tumbled by at least a third since 1980. Inflation
hovers at around 170 percent while economic growth has been
negligible during the past eight years.
   The wage-productivity link was one of the requirements made by
the International Monetary Fund before agreeing to reschedule part
of Yugoslavia's debt.

   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis pressed ahead
today with the anti-crime, anti-drug campaign he and Republican
George Bush have been waging in the South. He promised support for
police training and accepted endorsement from law enforcement
officials.
   Bush, who has been hitting hard on the same crime-and-drugs
themes, was back in Washington after a Friday trip to Richmond, Va.
He scheduled weekend campaigning in the Midwest.
   Jesse Jackson, after wrapping up two days of seeking ``super
delegate'' support in Washington, headed for Texas to address that
state's Democratic convention.
   Bush, meanwhile, continued to struggle with the ``gender gap''
as an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll gave the Massachusetts
governor a 15-point lead nationwide over the vice president.
Dukakis had a 52-28 lead among women voters.
   Dukakis, whose only Southern primary victories were in Florida
and Texas, found less than smooth sailing Thursday on the first day
of his Southern tour. In Tennessee to pick up the endorsement of
former rival Al Gore Jr., he was put on the spot about allegations
that Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright committed ethics
violations.
   The Massachusetts governor talked today with police recruits in
Miami and received the backing of a group of law enforcement
officials that included the Democratic attorneys general of
Florida, California, Louisiana and Michigan. The group also
included police chiefs, sheriffs, district attorneys and members of
private anti-crime organizations.
   Dukakis began his day at a flag-raising ceremony at the
Southeast Florida Institute of Criminal Justice, providing a
symbolic response to criticism from the Bush campaign of his veto,
a decade ago, of legislation that would have required the
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in Massachusetts schools.
   He vetoed the bill after the state supreme court advised him it
was unconstitutional. Bush has begun raising the veto and saying he
favors recitation of the pledge ``anywhere and everywhere.''
   Dukakis told the police trainees they would be leading the fight
to ``provide all Americans with the kind of safety and security
they're entitled to have in their homes and in their communities
and in their neighborhoods.'' He added, ``I'm going to do
everything I can to provide you with the kind of leadership you
must have from the top ... to provide you with the support and the
resources and the training you need.
   Jackson, concluding a visit to the capital on Thursday,
continued to try to call in support in return of his years of work
mobilizing black voters for Democratic candidates.
   The ``basic party leadership while accepting my investment in
the party to make it strong has not been as reciprocal as it ought
to be,'' Jackson said Thursday after meeting with 33 Democratic
senators. He pressed at the meeting for more unpledged ``super
delegates'' to the July Democratic convention to support him.
   Dukakis, speaking to South Carolina high school students at a
conference on drug and alcohol abuse, tried to shed any image of
himself as a free-spending liberal in a region that went strongly
for Ronald Reagan.
   ``People aren't interested in labels,'' he said. ``I've balanced
nine budgets in a row, while the self-styled conservatives in the
White House haven't been able to balance the budget in eight
years.''
   He also cited his administration's record in reducing crime in
Massachusetts.
   Dukakis was meeting today with law enforcement officials from
around the country who are backing his presidential candidacy. He
planned to outline his proposal to form a national crime council if
elected president.
   Bush, a gun-control opponent, said in an interview Thursday he
empathized with Carl Rowan, the Washington-based syndicated
columnist who shot and wounded a backyard intruder.
   Rowan, who has written columns favoring stricter gun control,
shot the teen-ager, who had been swimming with a group of friends
in Rowan's backyard pool, with a pistol police said was
unregistered.
   ``I kind of empathize with what he was going through when
somebody was coming at him,'' Bush said. Rowan has said he fired
the shot after the teen-ager lunged at him.
   In a speech to an annual meeting of the U.S. Jaycees in
Richmond, Va., Bush reiterated his views on strong penalties for
those convicted of drug offenses and said the policy of ``zero
tolerance'' for drugs should be applied to the workplace as well as
to cars, planes and boats.
   Earlier Thursday, Dukakis said we welcomed having an independent
counsel investigate the allegations against Wright and found the
issue different from the investigation of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   ``If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided
as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office,'' he said.
   Both Bush and Dukakis were sent a message from the nation's
black mayors that the candidates must address black Americans'
concerns.
   ``Those folks who want to go into office _ Gov. Dukakis and
George Bush _ and don't take those populations that we represent
seriously, then we will not take them seriously,'' John H. Smith,
mayor of Prichard, Ala., said Thursday.
   Smith, a Republican, is head of the National Conference of Black
Mayors.

<TEXT>
   Ken Monaghan paused at the top of North
Great George's Street and said: ``Well, this is where it all
happened. Doesn't the whole place just reek of him?''
   He was referring to his uncle, James Joyce, and the Dublin he
immortalized in that colossus of 20th century literature,
``Ulysses.''
   Monaghan, a gentle, snowy-haired man of 62, was taking an
acquaintance around the old neighborhood on Bloomsday eve, hoping
to beat the influx of tourists and Joyce lovers who arrived
Thursday for Bloomsday itself, the most celebrated day of
remembrance ever created by a novel.
   Bloomsday is June 16, 1904, the single day during which
``Ulysses'' unfolds through the wanderings of Joyce's fictional
alter ego Stephen Dedalus, and that quintessential Dubliner,
Leopold Bloom.
   Every Bloomsday, the faithful retrace the action from the
starting point of ``Ulysses'' at the Tower overlooking the sea to
the streets of inner Dublin where the story ends.
   They search for the little that is left of Joyce's meticulous
charting. Some dress up in Edwardian clothes, beige ensembles
favored by Joyce and Bloom-style bowler and black three-piece suit.
   The pilgrims meander from the Forty Foot, the gentlemen-only
bathing cove below the Tower, to No. 7 Eccles Street, where Bloom
lived with his adulterous wife Molly.
   In between, they take in landmarks like the Davy Byrnes pub
where Bloom stopped for refreshment and a cemetery where he
attended Paddy Dignam's funeral. They walk past ``saddened angels,
crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with
upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands.''
   Others are gathered in Venice for the 11th International Joyce
Conference.
   At the Tower, now a Joyce museum, the Dublin literati gather
over wine and canapes to launch yet another guide to Joyce's
Dublin. City Hall, as part of the celebrations of Dublin's 1988
millennium, has funded a series of plaques at ``Ulysses'' landmarks.
   This year's Bloomsday, on Thursday, was especially elaborate
with a recreation of Dignam's cortege complete with horse-drawn
carriages.
   It wasn't always so. It took 30 years for Dublin to start
lionizing its native son. And with good reason. Had he not written
a profane and obscene book that poured scorn on everything from the
Roman Catholic Church to Irish nationalism?
   Had he not lampooned his friends in the guise of fiction?
   Had he not deserted Dublin in 1912, never to live there again?
   Monaghan remembers his Aunts Eva and Florrie, sisters of Joyce,
imploring him never to tell anyone he was related to the writer.
   Even today, Joyce's legacy is not all sweet. His grandson
Stephen, who lives in Paris, recently announced to the horror of
Joyceans that he had burned a series of letters by Joyce's daughter
Lucia, who died in a sanatorium in 1982.
   ``Personal things should remain personal,'' Stephen Joyce was
quoted as saying. ``Being ill in the way my aunt was is very
painful, and it is deplorable to delve into it.''
   Monaghan's walk takes him past the home of John P. Mehaffy, the
late provost of Trinity College, Dublin, who once declared Joyce to
be all the evidence he needed that education was wasted on the
Irish.
   Belvedere School comes into view, and the sidewalk Joyce trod as
a boy, trying not to step on the cracks. Up the road lies Mountjoy
Square, where Monaghan's aunts lived. He remembers them leaning out
of a window with a telescope to read the time on Findlater's Church
clock.
   Meanwhile, back at the Forty Foot, elderly men snort and splash
in the emerald waters with ``warm sunshine merrying over the sea''
just as Stephen Dedalus saw it.
   Suddenly, a gentleman in bowler and black three-piece suit drops
a towel on a rock, strips naked and plunges in.
   It's Gerry Davis, a Dublin painter who faithfully observes each
anniversary with a swim at the Forty Foot.
   Despite his self-exile, Joyce said he never really left Dublin.
All his writing was set there, and he liked to say that if Dublin
was ever destroyed, it could be reconstructed from his works.
   Dublin was slow to reciprocate. Early enthusiasts coined the
name Bloomsday in 1924, but only 30 years later did Dublin writers
stage the first commemoration.
   Today it is everything short of a public holiday. Copies of
``Ulysses,'' which once had to be smuggled into Ireland, now grace
bookshop windows in all their unexpurgated glory.
   Joyce, who also wrote ``Finnegans Wake'' and ``Dubliners,''
published ``Ulysses'' in Paris in 1922, and it was banned in the
United States and Britain that year. Joyce died in 1941 in Zurich
at age 59.
   In 1924, Joyce wrote in his notebook: ``Today, 16th June 20
years after. Will anybody remember this date?''

   Angolan guerrillas attacked and
destroyed a convoy of five trains on the southern Benguela railway,
killing 34 government soldiers, the rebels claimed today.
   In a note issued in Lisbon, the rebel movement, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, said the attack
occurred Tuesday between the southern Angolan towns of Kinjenje and
Babaera.
   The note, signed by the rebels' chief of staff, Gen. Demostenes
Amos Chilingutila, said four guerrillas died and 11 were wounded in
the three-hour battle.
   The rebel movement is backed by the United States and South
Africa. It has been fighting the Marxist Movement for the
Liberation of Angola government to share power since the country
achieved independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The government is backed by the Soviets and an estimated 40,000
Cuban troops.

   A wayward humpback whale who strayed up the
Hudson River cut his Big Apple visit short after Coast Guard
officials gunned their engines, banged pipes and sounded horns to
get him to turn around.
   The 30- to 40-foot whale, described by ocean researchers as
being a juvenile, was last spotted just after 6 a.m. today off the
Earle Naval Weapons Station in New Jersey, said Coast Guard
spokesman Larry Lawrence. The station is approximately 50 miles
from New York City.
   The gray-and-white whale wandered into the Hudson Thursday
afternoon. ``He just made a wrong turn following the contours of
the ocean floor,'' said Judy Rabb of the Long Island-based Okeanos
Ocean Research Foundation.
   The whale went as far as 80th Street before two Coast Guard
boats that were tracking him got the endangered mammal to reverse
direction by sounding horns, banging pipes, gunning their engines
and doing anything else they could think of to annoy the creature.
   Lawrence said the Coast Guard was through babysitting the
wandering whale.
   ``We've contacted someone from the National Marine Fisheries
Service and they're taking the case over now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Black Labor Unions Plan Two-Day Protest Strike</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ Major black trade unions in
this South Africa-ruled territory said today they plan a two-day
general strike to protest security force policies.
   A newspaper editor was reported detained today under a
proclamation allowing detention without trial.
   The unions, representing an estimated 60,000 workers, said in
full-page newspaper advertisements that the strike will take place
Monday and Tuesday unless their demands are met.
   The demands include the release of detainees, withdrawal of
police from black townships, and the relocation of security force
bases that are next to schools in the northern war zone.
   South-West Africa, commonly known as Namibia, was been
administered by South Africa since World War I. South Africa has
defied calls by the United Nations to grant independence to the
territory, saying it would consider doing so only after Cuban
troops withdraw from neighboring, Marxist-ruled Angola.
   Today marked the third anniversary of the installation of a
multiracial interim government in Namibia, where blacks make up
nearly 90 percent of the 1.3 million population.
   The chairman of the transitional Cabinet, Andrew Matjila, said
the planned general strike and an ongoing classroom boycott by many
black students were part of a campaign to create insecurity in the
territory.
   ``We have no intention of letting events slip out of our
control,'' said Matjila, who is black.
   The unions organizing the strike are affiliated with the
South-West African People's Organization, Namibia's largest
independent movement. It is a legal political organization in
Namibia, but its guerrilla wing is outlawed and has waged a bush
war in the north since 1966.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Charges 69 with Theft of Treasury Checks from Mail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaints of missing checks and other valuables
at post offices in Illinois have led to charges against 69 people
of stealing money from the mail, forging signatures and fencing
property, a U.S. attorney says.
   Twenty-nine of those named in indictments announced Thursday are
Postal Service employees, many of whom worked together in small
rings, said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.
   Most of the stolen securities were U.S. Treasury checks, Valukas
said. But he could not say how much the thefts totaled or how many
people may have been affected.
   He also said many of the stolen securities were welfare checks,
``placing an immense burden on those least able to afford it.''
   He said one ring of three men fenced 45 checks worth almost
$42,700 and another of four men conspired to steal and sell 57
checks worth $45,000.
   In addition to theft of treasury checks, Valukas said packages
containing jewelry, credit cards and other valuables were stolen
from Chicago's main post office as well as postal stations as far
away as Rockford and Aurora.
   Mark Grey, head of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for the
Chicago district, said inspectors from his office worked undercover
for 18 months after noticing unusually high loss figures for the
district and receiving an inordinant amount of complaints from the
public.
   In an unrelated case, Valukas also disclosed a kickback scheme
that centers on Central Truck Parts Co., which is charged with
paying bribes to purchasing agents for the city of Chicago, the
suburb of Wilmette and the state to secure contracts illegally.
   Charges against 24 people, including three Chicago employees and
one state employee, range from racketeering to failure to provide
information to the Internal Revenue Service.

   Club-swinging riot police in Hungary beat
demonstrators and arrested 25 people who gathered to memorialize
activists executed for leading the 1956 anti-communist revolt, a
dissident said today.
   The government media reported only five arrests.
   Police arrested the demonstrators after Thursday's unofficial
gatherings in Budapest, dissident Miklos Haraszti said in a
telephone conversation from the city. He said they were all later
released.
   He told The Associated Press that two well-known dissidents,
Gabor Demszky and Roza Hodosan, were taken to a district police
precinct, handcuffed, thrown to the floor and beaten in front of 15
other people arrested with them.
   ``They yelled to police to stop beating the two, but the police
didn't stop,'' Haraszti said.
   The activists were part of an officially estimated crowd of 400
who gathered in downtown Budapest on Thursday after a peaceful
morning vigil at the unmarked graves where former premier Imre Nagy
and fellow leaders of the 1956 revolt are believed buried.
   The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a
new government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On
Nov. 4, the Soviets mobilized 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks
to quell the uprising in Budapest.
   The only official report on Thursday's events came in a brief
report carried by the MTI news agency, which said that five alleged
ringleaders were detained for ``trying to bring under their
influence the crowd ... whom they had mobilized.''
   The report accused the crowd of disregarding a ``preliminary
warning by the police'' against attending the gatherings marking
the 30th anniversary of the executions.
   The protesters, chanting ``Democracy, Democracy'' and ``Nagy,
Nagy,'' demanded rehabilitation of Nagy and some of his associates
who were also executed or sentenced to prison and sang the
Hungarian national anthem.
   About 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent
identity checks.
   About a half hour later, the crowd moved toward the Danube
river, which divides the historic city of Buda and Pest, and then
to the nearby Hungarian television center.
   After dissident Janos Kiss addressed the crowd from the steps of
the television station building, riot police moved in to disperse
the rally, witnesses said.
   ``They came with rubber truncheons and even drove motorcycles at
a clip into the crowd to frighten and disperse it,'' said a witness
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Police were a little crazy.
I saw people knocked to the ground by the cops and beaten up.''
   The source said one of those injured was Ottilia Solt, an
activist who was taken to her home ``in pretty bad shape.''
   Haraszti said police ``attacked deliberately and brutally'' and
did not spare women or children.
   Witnesses said police did not interfere during an evening
requiem mass, however.
   Thursday's ceremonies in honor of Nagy and three close
associates marked 30 years since official media published a
Ministry of Justice decree on June 17, 1958, announcing the four
were sentenced to death. The statement said they ``played a leading
role in the preparation and starting of the counter-revolutionary
uprising in October 1956.''

   Police have arrested 18 people for
allegedly stealing and selling ancient corpses believed to possess
magical powers, a newspaper said today.
   The Kompas daily reported the arrests were made over the past
two months in the Mamasa district in Sulawesi island, 1,125 miles
northeast of Jakarta. The newspaper, quoting police, said buyers
were willing to pay up to $3,100 for ``corpses belonging to people
buried tens even hundreds of years ago.''
   The district police chief, Lt. Col. Ryanto Amrin was quoted as
saying the thieves ``acted on orders from some mysterious buyers''
and did not know what the buyers wanted to do with the corpses.
   Many people in the district still hold a long belief that
ancient corpses possessed magical powers, the paper said.
   The paper did not say how many graves had been broken by the
alleged corpse traders or identify the buyers. It did not detail
the investigation. It said they were arrested for stealing and
selling corpses, but did not give formal charges.
   Cadavers in the district are traditionally treated with
substances that prevent them from decomposing for many years, the
paper said.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
says proposed federal charges against him and his wife would be
harassment and could not be proved, but he acknowledges he is
concerned.
   ``Of course I'm worried. I am worried. I could not sleep for one
whole night when I learned about it,'' Marcos said Thursday during
a news conference at his home overlooking Honolulu.
   Justice Department officials have been reviewing proposed
charges, including racketeering conspiracy to loot the Philippine
government over 20 years and fraud in the way money was concealed
behind false ownerships, Washington-based law enforcement
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
   ``What is racketeering? Where is the proof of the transfer of
funds?'' Marcos said.
   He said there is nothing new about the allegations and dismissed
them as ``the same old charges.''
   ``All along I thought this was over.'' he said.
   ``This has been going on for two years,'' said Marcos, 70,
forced to leave office in 1986 and go into exile. ``It is
harassment, pure and simple. They should be dismissed because it is
only hearsay.''
   Marcos said there is no proof that he stole money while he was
president.
   On another topic, Marcos said he still held out hope that the
government of President Corazon Aquino would allow him to return to
the Philippines for the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin
Marcos, who died May 4 at the age of 95.
   After the news conference in Marcos' living room, his wife,
Imelda, pulled two reporters into the dining room to see a
videotape showing thousands of Marcos supporters marching with a
motorcade that set out Wednesday from Manila carrying his mother's
body to her home province of Ilocos Norte, 250 miles away.
   The two-hour tape was shot by an amateur photographer, she said.
   Meanwhile, Marcos said he will go to a hospital in the next few
days to have a knee examined.
   ``My left knee is in pain, the muscle is weakened and I can
hardly walk,'' he said. ``The pains are very unbearable.''
   Marcos was hospitalized for two days last month for chest pains
his doctor said were caused by arthritis or inflammation in the
area of the left sixth rib.

<TEXT>
   A Hollywood photographer who spent
decades shooting pictures of glamorous stars says his favorite
subject was a shy, adventurous pilot he thought of as a sister.
   When Albert Bresnik signed on as Amelia Earhart's personal
photographer in 1932, he was accustomed to subjects with more flash
and charisma than the aviation pioneer. Eventually, he learned
Earhart's inner beauty outshined the luster of his Hollywood
subjects.
   ``She was a fantastic woman who didn't have what we call
charisma. She had an inner loveliness, a gallant nature. She wanted
to prove that women should be as good as men in flight,'' Bresnik,
74, said during an interview Wednesday.
   ``I have photographed the biggest stars, actresses that had a
lot of beauty and talent. But Amelia has shone up above them all.''
   As part of the today's 60th anniversary of Earhart's first
trans-Atlantic flight, Bresnik is displaying rarely seen
photographs of the aviator in this northern California city near
San Jose. The photographs were taken during the five years before
Earhart disappeared in the South Pacific.
   On June 18, 1928, Earhart became the first woman to fly across
the Atlantic as a navigator. She set out a day earlier, flying with
pilot Wilmer Stultz, and an airplane mechanic, Lou Gordon, from
Trepassey, Newfoundland, to Burry Port, Wales.
   Although Earhart later made a solo flight across the Atlantic,
the 1928 flight is hailed as a major aviation victory for women and
was celebrated with a ticker tape parade in New York City.
   Earhart met Bresnik four years later and hired him to accompany
her to public events and help her prepare a book. Her husband,
publisher George Putnam, approached Bresnik in 1932, while Bresnik
was a photographer for CBS.
   ``She liked me very much, right off the bat. She called me her
little brother. We just joked and got along very well. She didn't
want anyone else to shoot her picture,'' said Bresnik, who lives in
the Los Angeles area.
   Several months before her mysterious disappearance they began
shooting photographs for a book Earhart wanted to call ``World
Flight.'' Originally, Bresnik was to accompany Earhart and her
navigator Fred Noonan and her radio control operator Harry Manning
on their last flight.
   However, Bresnik was replaced by Earhart's flight technician
Paul Mantz.
   ``I was supposed to go only because I would take pictures when
she would stop and meet the heads of state. During the last 2,500
miles, I was to wait for her in Oakland and photograph her
arrival.''
   The crew of four flew to Hawaii, but they returned to Oakland
after the plane had mechanical problems. Earhart and Noonan then
recommenced their historic flight attempt, heading east without
Mantz and Manning.
   ``The preparations changed daily. She finally said to me, `Well,
I'm leaving,' and I said, `I had a ticket to go and somewhere along
the way I lost the ticket.' And she said, `Well, that's the way the
wind blows.'''
   ``I said, `God bless you. Have a nice trip and I'll see you when
you get back.'''
   Several years after the disappearance, the book was published as
``Last Flight.'' It features many of Bresnik's photographs of
Earhart and her Model 10E Electra ``Flying Laboratory,'' the
aircraft she was flying when she disappeared.
   Most of Bresnik's Earhart photos were stored away after her
disappearance. He didn't bring them out until last year, the 50th
anniversary of Earhart's last flight.
   Many of the details surrounding Earhart's disappearance are
unknown. It is known that she completed about 22,000 miles of the
flight, and it is believed she went down within 100 miles of the
Howland Islands in the South Pacific.
   Over the years, there have been claims that Earhart is alive and
living on an island in the South Pacific or that she and Manning
were actually spies who were kidnapped by the Japanese.
   While Bresnik dismisses most of these claims, but he does have
one bizarre story of his own.
   The day before Earhart was reported missing, a man walked into
Bresnik's Hollywood shop and identified himself as a doctor,
Bresnik said. He stared at one of Bresnik's photographs of Earhart
and said, ``The lightforce in the picture is gone, she's crashed
and drowned.'' Bresnik said.
   ``In Hollywood, we had people that were sort of crazy. But I
called George, her husband, and said, `George, what's happened (to
Amelia)?' And he said, `She's fine, I talked to her yesterday.'''
   Several hours later, Bresnik heard that Earhart's plane was lost.

<HEAD>Court Says Federal Judges May Be Disqualified From Presiding Over
Some Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal judges may be disqualified from
presiding over cases even when they are unaware during trial of
their personal connection to the cases, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Louisiana, the court said the
appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to
disqualify himself from presiding.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said even if a
judge is unaware of a possible conflict while presiding over a case
he later should disqualify himself when he learns of his connection.
   The judge's initial lack of knowledge of the possible conflict
``does not eliminate the risk that his impartiality might
reasonably be questioned by other persons,'' Stevens said.
   In such instances, the judge ``is called upon to rectify an
oversight and to take the steps necessary to maintain public
confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary,'' Stevens said.
   The case stems from a dispute over ownership of a hospital
corporation. It began in 1981 when Health Services Acquisition
Corp. filed a federal lawsuit against John Liljeberg over ownership
of a corporation known as St. Jude Hospital of Kenner, La.
   St. Jude Hospital had a state certificate of approval to build a
new facility.
   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Collins ruled on March 16, 1982,
in favor of Liljeberg.
   But the following year Health Services Acquisition learned that
Collins was a member of the board of trustees of Loyola University,
which had been negotiating with Liljeberg to sell him property for
a new hospital.
   Liljeberg's ability to build the hospital depended on his
success in obtaining the St. Jude certificate of approval.
   Health Services Acquisition went back to court seeking to
disqualify Collins and throw out his ruling that favored Liljeberg.
   Collins refused to disqualify himself. But the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court overruled him and threw out the judgment favoring Liljeberg.
   In upholding the appeals court ruling, the Supreme Court said
Collins should have disqualified himself when he became aware of
his connection to the case even though he had a temporary memory
lapse about his ties during the trial.
   Dissenting today were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The case is Liljeberg vs. Health Services Acquisition., 86-957.

<HEAD>Trustee Predicts PTL Deal, Bakker Submits Rental Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL ministry should strike a deal by
the end of the month with one of at least four prospective buyers
for its 2,300-acre Heritage USA complex, its bankruptcy trustee
predicted.
   M.C. ``Red'' Benton told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds on
Thursday that all of the potential buyers want to maintain it as a
Christian retreat while allowing the church and cable television
network to operate as a separate, non-profit corporation.
   Benton said he foresees no future for founder Jim Bakker at PTL,
either as a legitimate buyer or as a guest on the ministry's cable
television program.
   Bakker ``has shown no positive evidence he has resources to come
up with a plan'' to buy PTL and his presence on the show would be
harmful to the ministry, Benton said. ``He's still floundering out
in left field.''
   Benton's comments came as a Bakker attorney submitted a formal
proposal for Bakker to regain control of the ministry, a newspaper
reported today.
   Bakker proposes to rent the Heritage Grand Hotel and Heritage
Island water park in Fort Mill, S.C., while buying broadcast time
on the PTL satellite network, The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer
reported.
   The newspaper said Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis gave the proposal
to PTL attorney Joe Allman after Thursday's court hearing.
   The newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying the proposal
is unacceptable to Benton and Reynolds because Bakker's return
would seriously damage the ministry's credibility.
   Benton said after the hearing that sports entrepreneur George
Shinn will submit a plan before the week ends to buy PTL's
property, where he would build a sports complex while allowing the
ministry functions to continue.
   Bakker has criticized Shinn's proposal because it would allow
alcohol to be sold at the Heritage Grand Hotel.
   Bakker said Wednesday that he still intends to regain control of
the ministry he began building in 1974 and believes he will be
accepted back by PTL's followers despite the sex and money scandal
that surfaced when he resigned in March 1987.
   Benton said the only way PTL can survive is if it sells its
property and forms a non-profit ministry that is debt free. PTL,
with current debts of up to $130 million and assets of $160
million, filed for reorganization in June 1987.
   Also Thursday, Bakker and his wife, Tammy, began moving into a
house in Lake Wylie, near PTL's Fort Mill headquarters, said Bakker
attorney James Toms.
   Inez Brown, president of the Bring Bakkers Back Club, said in a
news release that members of the group leased the $1,000-a-month
house for nine months for the Bakkers.

<HEAD>Court Told to Tackle Antitrust Dispute Over M-16</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, resolving what it called
``a peculiar battle'' between two federal appeals courts, told one
of those courts today to tackle an antitrust dispute over the M-16,
the U.S. military standard rifle.
   The justices unanimously ruled that the Chicago-based 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals should rule in the case, not the
Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
   The justices also said the Washington-based court was wrong
when, in ``the interest of justice,'' it ruled in the case after
deciding it lacked the proper authority to do so.
   Charles R. Christianson, owner of an M-16 parts company called
International Trade Services Inc., sued Colt Industries Operating
Corp. in 1984. He charged Colt, which dominates the market for M-16
sales, with violating federal antitrust law.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, contends that
Colt abused patents it held for the rifle and its various parts to
monopolize the market illegally.
   U.S. District Judge Robert D. Morgan ruled for Christianson, and
Colt appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
a Washington-based court that concentrates on patent disputes.
   Christianson sought to have the case transferred to the 7th
Circuit court, and the Federal Circuit court agreed with him that
it lacked the jurisdiction to handle Colt's appeal.
   The 7th Circuit court, however, ruled that the Federal Circuit
court was ``clearly wrong'' in its jurisdictional decision and sent
the case back to Washington.
   Confronted with the case a second time, the Washington-based
appeals court last year said that although it lacked the proper
jurisdiction it would rule in the case.
   It then ruled against Christianson.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice William J. Brennan
said the 7th Circuit court was wrong about which court had
jurisdiction and set aside the Federal Circuit court's ruling on
the lawsuit's merits.
   In a victory for Christianson, the case now heads back to the
7th Circuit court.
   The case is Christianson vs. Colt Industries, 87-499.

<HEAD>Survey: Three-Fourths Of Public Favor Animal Research For Medical
Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of an animal rights group says she's not
impressed by a poll which found that 77 percent of Americans
believe medical progress depends on the use of animals in research.
   ``It's hardly an unbiased survey, I must say,'' said Ingrid
Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   Ms. Newkirk considers the poll, commissioned by the American
Medical Association, a public relations ploy, saying the money
could have been put to greater use by improving the living
conditions of laboratory animals.
   Results of the survey, conducted in February by Tarrance-SRI of
Houston, were reported in today's edition of American Medical News,
the weekly newspaper of the AMA.
   Of 1,500 adults surveyed nationwide, 77 percent said they
believed the use of animals in medical research is necessary, while
17 percent disagreed and 6 percent weren't sure, the AMA reported.
   Support of animal research appeared to grow with education and
income level, the poll found. Of respondents with annual incomes of
at least $30,000, 83 percent approved of the research.
   Respondents were surveyed by telephone in a random sample of
residential listings in the United States. The margin of error was
plus or minus 2.5 percent, the AMA said.
   ``The overwhelming positive response to our survey question
indicates to me that a vast majority of the American public
recognizes the benefits their families enjoy with today's modern
medicines, which were made possible by animal research,'' said Dr.
James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president.
   ``The American Medical Association has been and will continue to
be a very vocal proponent of responsible _ and let me emphasize
responsible _ use of animals in medical research.''
   Ms. Newkirk said the poll was nothing but an attempt ``to turn
back the growing tide of public opinion that animals need some
protection in the lab.'' Her private, not-for-profit group, based
in Washington, D.C., has 150,000 members.
   She accused the AMA of leading ``the fight to defeat all
legislation on Capitol Hill, no matter how minimal, that would
affect the living and dying conditions of animals.''
   Dr. M. Roy Schwarz countered Newkirk's charge that the poll was
biased, saying ``we certainly would stand behind'' the findings.
   Schwarz, the AMA's assistant executive vice president for
medical education and science, also denied that the AMA has tried
to thwart efforts to protect laboratory animals.
   He said the organization is supporting revision of Department of
Agriculture guidelines to set higher standards and force
improvement in animal facilities.
   Newkirk said the immediate goal of her group is to eliminate
``gratuitous cruelty'' to animals, including the testing of
cosmetics, and eventually hopes to end all animal lab testing.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
between 17 million and 22 million animals are used annually in
biomedical experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent are
rodents _ rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent with fish,
amphibians and birds making up the rest.
   Sixty percent of the experiments cause no suffering to the
animal, and in 32 percent of cases, animals receive pain-killing
drugs or anesthesia, according to Stephen Smith, a senior scientist
with the AMA Department of Drugs division of drugs and toxicology.
In 8 percent of cases, the animal does suffer pain, he said.

   Former bank director Edwin L. Cox Jr.'s agreement
to plead guilty to a federal bank fraud charge should be a warning
that returning funds won't ward off prosecution, a U.S. attorney
says.
   Cox announced Thursday that he was resigning as chairman of the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. He said he had agreed to plead
guilty to one count of bank fraud stemming from $80 million in
loans he had received from his bank several years ago.
   ``Those who have access to large sums of borrowed money are
going to have to understand that they must obey the same rules and
laws as the rest of us. No one is above the law,'' said U.S.
Attorney Marvin Collins.
   Cox repaid in October 1987 the $80 million in loans he received
while a director of InterFirst Bank Dallas from 1984 to 1986, plus
an additional $16 million in interest and fees. Cox, 41, of Athens,
once ran one of the largest cattle-feeding and processing
operations in the nation.
   The bank fraud charge stemmed from reports Cox filed for
continuation of the loans indicating he was putting up more than
20,000 head of cattle as collateral when there were fewer than
5,000, Collins said.
   ``It is my hope that this case sends a strong message to those
who think nothing will happen if they pay the money back,'' said
the prosecutor.
   ``In breaking the law, I have made a serious mistake,'' Cox said
in a statement. ``I have hurt my wife and children, our many loyal
friends, and employees. I have disappointed those who had the
greatest confidence in me. For this, I have no one to blame but
myself. I am truly sorry that I have let all these people down.''
   His attorney, Bruce Genderson, said Cox would enter the plea
June 24. A sentencing date will be set then. Maximum punishment
upon conviction is five years in prison and $250,000 in fines,
Collins said.
   Cox's financial problems became public in July 1986. InterFirst
Corp., the parent of InterFirst Bank Dallas, which subsequently
merged with RepublicBank to become First RepublicBank, announced
that loans made by the bank to Cox were in default.

<TEXT>
   Authorities discovered a Red Brigades
terrorist hideout, arrested eight people and seized a submachine
gun possibly used to kill Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, according to
Italian news reports today.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said warrants issued by a
prosecutor in Milan accused the eight people of participating in an
armed band and of illegally possessing weapons.
   ANSA and the newspaper La Repubblica said anti-terrorist police
investigators discovered the hideout at an apartment in Milan and
found weapons, an undisclosed amount of money and documents.
   Police officials declined immediate comment on the news reports.
   ANSA and La Repubblica, citing unidentified law enforcement
sources, said terrorists may have used a submachine gun found at
the hideout to kill Ruffilli, economist Ezio Tarantelli and former
Florence Mayor Lando Conti.
   The Red Brigades, Italy's infamous left-wing terror group, had
claimed responsibility for killing all three.
   ANSA said ballistics experts were checking the submachine gun
and other weapons found at the apartment.
   Ruffilli, a Christian Democrat and close friend and adviser of
Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was killed in April at his apartment in
Forli, a small town near Bologna.
   Tarantelli, who was shot and killed in Rome in March 1985, was a
leading official of the Christian Democrat-dominated labor union
CISL and had been a member of the government commission that
drafted a plan to reduce Italian workers' automatic wage increases.
   Conti, who was killed in February 1986 in Florence, was a
consultant for a company that produced radar and other military
electronic equipment. He had been accused in left-wing pamphlets of
``exporting war.''

   Four convicted killers and four other
inmates who fled Kentucky's maximum-security prison may have spent
months plotting their elaborate escape plan from the 105-year-old
fortress, officials say.
   ``They had no hope of leaving legally anytime soon. They had
nothing else to do but spend their time thinking of a way to get
out,'' Jack Wood, a spokesman for the Kentucky State Penitentiary,
said after Thursday's escape.
   Bobby Waller, another prison spokesman, said today that a 2 to
3-inch piece of hacksaw blade was found in one of the escapee's
cells, the first tool of escape officials had found.
   He said investigators had recovered other information but he was
unable to release any details.
   In Fayetteville, N.C., meanwhile, authorities today recaptured
the third of six men who escaped from a Cumberland County jail on
Sunday.
   Prison officials are usually able to prevent escape attempts
because they ``hear the rumblings that something's going on'' and
then conduct searches that turn up contraband or homemade equipment
that could be used in an escape, said Kentucky State Penitentiary
Warden William Seabold.
   ``But the number (of escapees) and the avenue they took would
indicate it was well-planned and not a spur-of-the-moment escape
attempt,'' Seabold said.
   The eight are believed to have split up after what authorities
say was the largest prison escape in state history. The search for
the inmates was focused within two miles of the prison, and there
were no confirmed sightings of the escapees by midmorning, said
Waller.
   At least nine other inmates also attempted to flee the prison,
authorities said.
   The penitentiary, about 200 miles southwest of Louisville on
Lake Barkley, was built in 1883 and has undergone several additions
and renovations over the years. It is surrounded on three sides by
water and on the fourth by woods, but no wall or fence enclosed the
cellblock from which the eight fled.
   Waller said a boat was being used in the search, as well as two
state police small airplanes, 20 troopers, a dog team, local
authorities and 60 prison officers. In addition, pictures of the
escapees were distributed in area stores and gas stations.
   Dogs tracked the scent of at least one escapee to the site where
a pickup truck was stolen, about a half-mile from the prison.
   Authorities warned residents to lock their doors and watch their
children closely.
   Collaborators set several small fires in another section of the
building early Thursday to divert guards, giving the eight about 15
minutes to make their escape, Waller said.
   ``Fire in an institution like this is an extreme emergency,''
Wood said, explaining why guards at the time were not paying
attention to the cellhouse from which the prisoners escaped.
``You've got people locked up in cells and they can't get away.
You've got an enclosed area and smoke can reach dangerous levels
very quickly.''
   The escapees were housed in a cellblock known as ``the jail
within the jail,'' which is used to separate certain inmates from
the general population, Wood said.
   ``There's more security in the sense that there's more staff in
the cellhouse,'' Wood said.
   Wood said six of the escapees, who included four convicted
killers, were being housed in the cellhouse because they had been
charged with or found guilty of assault on other inmates. The other
two were being investigated for an escape attempt last week.
   The escapees apparently sawed open their cell doors and then cut
through a prison window that was enclosed by a screen on one side
and criss-crossed bars on the other, he said. They climbed down an
extension cord tied to a window about 30 feet above the ground.
   Once outside, the escapees traveled across a small parking lot
toward Lake Barkley, where they walked along the shore to the other
side of the prison and up into a wooded area, Wood said.
   One prisoner who failed to escape was found hanging from the
window and three others were outside their cells. Five additional
cells had been tampered with, Waller said.
   The prison, which houses 780 inmates, remained under lockdown
status, during which time prisoners are confined to their cells, he
said.
   ``We're going to make absolutely sure there is nothing else in
progress,'' Seabold said.
   In North Carolina, three prison escapees were still at large
from a Sunday jailbreak, including a former soldier convicted in
two Ninja-style slayings.
   Gregory Maurice Lee, 30, of Fayetteville, was arrested early
today at an apartment after Fayetteville police received a
telephone tip. Lee, who had been serving time for burglary, larceny
and assault, offered no resistance, said police Lt. William
Barefoot.
   Six men escaped from the Law Enforcement Center Sunday night
after using hacksaw blades to cut through a floor-level piece of
steel and kick out a portion of a bar, authorities said. They used
knotted bedsheets to climb four stories down the building's side.
One escapee fell and was soon recaptured; a second prisoner was
arrested Wednesday.

   Japan is concerned about North Korea's deployment
of surface-to-air missiles and jet fighters near the border with
South Korea just a few months before the Olympic Games, a Japanese
defense official said today.
   The deployment of the Soviet-made SA-5 missiles near the
demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas means the weapons can
strike planes at Seoul's international airport, the Defense Agency
official said.
   ``This is happening just before the Olympic Games start, and is
dangerous,'' said the official. He spoke with foreign reporters on
condition his name not be used.
   The Summer Olympics are scheduled to be played in Seoul from
Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   North Korea has demanded to co-host the Olympics, and
authorities say the communist regime in Pyongyang may try to
disrupt the games through terrorism.
   The Japanese official said the missiles, with a range of 186
miles, can hit aircraft at Seoul's Kimpo Airport, which is 20 miles
from the demilitarized zone.
   The deployment of the SA-5s as well as Soviet-made Sukhoi-25 jet
fighters near the DMZ was ``comparatively recent,'' the official
said. He said he did not know exactly when they were put in place
or how many there were.
   The Su-25 is a fixed-wing fighter used for low-level support. It
is known in the West as the ``Frogfoot.''
   The Korean peninsula was divided in the communist north and the
pro-Western south in 1945. The two sides fought the Korean War from
1950-53.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down Ohio Law Dealing With Out-of-State Defendants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today struck down an Ohio
law that exempted from any deadlines the filing of lawsuits against
out-of-state defendants.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled that the law unduly interfered
with interstate commerce.
   The decision upheld lower court rulings that an Ohio
manufacturer's breach-of-contract lawsuit against an Illinois
corporation properly was dismissed for having been filed too late.
   The justices said the Ohio law that would have allowed the
manufacturer to sue even after the normal deadline had passed
discriminated against out-of-state businesses.
   Bendix Autolite Corp. sued Midwesco Enterprises Inc. in 1980
over a coal-fired boiler that was installed in a Bendix plant at
Fostoria, Ohio, in 1975.
   Midwesco sought to have the lawsuit dismissed, contending that
under Ohio law suits alleging breach of contract or fraud must be
filed within four years of the alleged wrongdoing.
   The lawyers for Bendix relied on another Ohio law, one saying
lawsuits against out-of-state defendants do not have to comply with
the usual four-year deadline.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
said the Ohio law forced out-of-state businesses ``to choose
between exposure to the general jurisdiction of Ohio courts or
forfeiture of the (statute of) limitations defense, remaining
subject to suit in Ohio in perpetuity.''
   Saying the law imposed a ``significant burden'' on out-of-state
defendants, Kennedy added, ``The Ohio statute imposes a greater
burden on out-of-state companies than it does on Ohio companies,
subjecting the activities of foreign and domestic corporations to
inconsistent regulations.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented, voting to
reinstate the Ohio law.
   The case is Bendix Autolite vs. Midwesco Enterprises, 87-367.

<TEXT>
   A specially-built Dutch cargo ship is in
the Persian Gulf to carry the mine-damaged U.S. Navy frigate Samuel
B. Roberts back to the United States this month, U.S. military
officials disclosed today.
   The Mighty Servant 2, a 25,743-ton ``semi-submersible'' cargo
ship, was escorted into the gulf Tuesday and went to Dubai, where
the Samuel B. Roberts is in drydock.
   The 3,600-ton frigate has been undergoing preliminary repairs in
Dubai since it struck a mine in the central gulf on April 14. Ten
members of its crew were injured in the blast.
   U.S. officers have credited other crewmen with saving them and
the ship itself after the mine, laid by Iran, blew a 22-foot gash
in the hull.
   The Navy contracted the Mighty Servant 2 from its owners,
Wijsmuller Beheer B.V., of Ijmuiden, Netherlands, to carry the
frigate back to the United States rather than attempt to sail it
home.
   Maj. Charles Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,
said no firm date had been set for the Samuel B. Roberts'
departure. But military sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the ship would leave the gulf this month.
   He said it would be taken to its home port at Newport, R.I. Navy
officials said earlier that the 2-year-old ship would be returned
to the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, where it was built, for
final repairs.
   The Samuel B. Roberts had just completed escorting a
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to Kuwait and was saiing back down the
Gulf when it lumbered over what U.S. offiers say was a freshly-laid
minefield 50 miles northeast of Qatar.
   The United States retaliated for the mining four days later with
attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the south central gulf.
That action began a day of fighting during which six Iranian naval
craft were sunk or disabled.
   The Navy escorts followed the U.S. reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers
to protect neutral shipping in the gulf, which has been the scene
of spillover violence in the 7-year-old Iran-Iraq war.

   The White House hinted today that President
Reagan might still veto a bill designed to turn the nation's
Depression-era welfare system into a jobs program but backers said
support for the measure is so strong that a veto threat does not
worry them.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said an amendment added
by the Senate mandating a work requirement for a small percentage
of welfare recipients was ``very progressive and helpful.''
   But he said the administration ``still has some problems with
the bill,'' which now goes to a congressional conference committee
to iron out differences with the version passed by the House.
   ``We ... would like to go further even in some of these areas''
than the Senate did, the spokesman said. He said the workfare
amendment was ``very important'' and the White House would be
studying other amendments added by the Senate.
   The House version, without the work requirement, is more
objectionable to the administration.
   ``We'll try to get changes in conference, but it's going to be
very tough to reconcile with the House bill that is so far out of
line with our judgment,'' Fitzwater said.
   When asked whether the president would sign the bill, the
spokesman said, ``There is no decision at this point. We'll just
have to wait and see.''
   The measure passed by the Senate by a vote of 93-3, far more
than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and Rep. Thomas Downey, both New York Democrats,
said House and Senate negotiators are expected to work out their
differences on the bill and have it on Reagan's desk by Labor Day.
   The Reagan administration had voiced concerns about the measure,
but Senate Republicans said that if conferees agreed on a bill that
looked like the Senate version, President Reagan might sign it.
   The two bill sponsors, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show,
termed the differences in the House and Senate bills primarily
``technical.'' Moynihan noted that the Senate's 93-3 vote indicated
strong support in the event of a veto.
   Downey said the negotiators ``have to be concerned about'' a
veto, but added: ``I'm not sure that that is the end of the world
if the president vetoes it.''
   ``It's possible to override the president's veto. It's possible
to attach it to something he wants. It's also possible to introduce
a bill possibly with a democratic president in the next Congress
that does all that we want it to do,'' he said.
   The Senate voted 93-3 Thursday to pass the $2.8 billion Family
Security Act after bowing to nearly all of President Reagan's
requests, including adoption of a mandatory workfare provision for
a small percentage of welfare recipients.
   Moynihan, author of the bill, on Thursday called it ``the first
legislation of its kind since the welfare system was established in
the 1930s.''
   The House last December passed a $7 billion welfare overhaul
bill. Moynihan and Downey, sponsor of the House bill, refused to
speculate on whether negotiations to reconcile the two bills would
produce a plan acceptable to the White House.
   The centerpiece of both bills is a massive new jobs, education
and training program aimed particularly at people who are longterm
_ or likely to become longterm _ welfare recipients. The
legislation also contains stringent new child support collection
requirements meant to assure that non-custodial parents pay their
fair share.
   The House would also offer financial incentives to states to
raise their cash benefits to poor families, which in many states
are less than half the federal poverty line.
   Moynihan, throughout an 18-month campaign for his bill, decried
the generally low level of welfare benefits but did not include a
provision to raise them.
   ``We can never address the issue of benefits at the national
level until we've persuaded the American public that this is a work
program, a child support program,'' he said after the vote. ``We
have started in that direction today.''
   Aid to Families with Dependent Children was established in 1935
as part of the Social Security system and now supports 3.7 million
families. Some 7 million children are on AFDC, which would be
renamed the Child Support Supplement System under Moynihan's bill.
   Originally conceived as a widow's benefit when women did not
work outside the home, AFDC now is dominated by divorced and unwed
mothers at a time when the majority of new mothers are at work
within a year of having a child.
   A 1987 study of welfare-to-work programs found numerous problems
including lack of money, lack of essential support services,
exclusion of mothers of children under 6, and little attention to
the people needing the most help.
   Under the new jobs program, states would have to offer a wide
range of activities including job training and basic education as
well as actual work. They would have to include as many people as
they could afford, and half the money would have to be spent on
those most likely to spend years on the rolls.
   Both the Senate and House bills commit substantial amounts of
federal money to the jobs program and to support services such as
child care. Mothers with children under 3 would be exempt from the
work-training requirement, but states could lower that to age 1.
   Both bills also require states to extend welfare benefits to
poor two-parent families. The Senate bill only would require the
benefits for six months in any 12-month period; 26 states already
provide year-round coverage.
   Negotiations throughout the week produced a number of Senate
concessions to the Reagan administration, including a provision
phasing in mandatory workfare for one adult in two-parent families
on the rolls. The workfare, or community work, would have to total
at least 16 hours a week.
   Moynihan argued against the requirement on the floor, saying
only nine states have workfare programs and many governors consider
them costly and counterproductive.
   But when Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., offered the
requirement as an amendment, senators refused 54-41 to kill it.
They then accepted the measure by a voice vote.
   Senators also agreed to a White House request for mandatory jobs
program participation rates. The jobs, education and training
activities offered by the states would have to be serving 22
percent of eligible participants by 1994.
   Money to cover $2.8 billion in new spending under the Moynihan
bill would come from making permanent a tax refund withholding
program to recover federal debts, and phasing out the business
meals and entertainment tax deduction for people with incomes over
$360,000. It would be eliminated entirely at $440,000.
   Voting no on the bill were Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., and William Proxmire, D-Wis. Not voting were
Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.; Dave Durenberger, R-Minn; Chic
Hecht, R-Nev., and James A. McClure, R-Idaho.

   A state scholarship board has rejected an
appeal from a top student that it accept her application for a
$5,000 grant since it was submitted late through no fault of her
own.
   The State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana voted 4-3
Thursday not to consider Nicole L. Lovett's scholarship
application, despite pleas by the 18-year-old graduate and her
guidance counselor, who missed the board's deadline.
   Miss Lovett, who graduated this month in the top 3 percent of
her class at Indianapolis North Central High School, gave her
application to counselor Donna March on Feb. 22.
   Mrs. Marsh told the commission at a hearing Thursday that she
neglected to notice the March 1 deadline for submitting the
application and asked that Miss Lovett not be penalized for her
mistake.
   Miss Lovett, who had nearly straight A's during her four years
of high school, was seeking the scholarship from the federally
funded Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship.
   The scholarships are based on the student's academic record in
competition with other applicants.
   The hearing followed an April decision to reject the application
because of the missed deadline.

   Rebels in southern Sudan say they killed
63 government troops and wounded 218 in two attacks near an army
garrison near the southeastern border with Ethiopia.
   The clandestine radio of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army
said Thursday that guerrillas ambushed the troops June 9 in the
first attack at Piyang forest, about 40 miles west of the town of
Akobo.
   Rebels one day later attacked troops at Riang, about 20 miles
south of the town, said the report, monitored in Nairobi, Kenya.
   The radio said rebel units also attacked Akobo's government
garrison, killing an unspecified number of troops. ``Four captains
and two lieutenants were among the dead,'' it said. The radio did
not say whether the officers were counted among the 63 soldiers
slain in the other attacks.
   No rebel casualties were given.
   ``The enemy soldiers also suffered widespread damage in military
equipment including five trucks loaded with foodstuffs,'' the
report added.
   Independent verification of the report was not immediately
possible. No telephone communications were available to Akobo.
   The rebels, mainly Christians and animists, have fought since
1983 against the Moslem-dominated central government for greater
autonomy and economic reforms in three southern provinces.

   A cold front accompanied by rain and storms that knocked out
power has ended a heat wave across the Northeast after three days
of record highs in the 90s, with today's highs forecast 15 to 20
degrees lower.
   In Massachusetts, medical officials said 20 deaths in Suffolk
County since Sunday, 14 of them Thursday, may have been caused in
part by the heat.
   The front slid across the upper East Coast during the night and
the clash of cool, dry air with the humid blanket of hot air
touched off storms, some violent.
   The Baltimore area was hit by hail and heavy rain that knocked
out power to about 22,000 customers. Power was restored to all but
300 customers by today.
   In northern Massachusetts, the heat wave was broken by strong
thunderstorms which brought half-inch hail and wind gusts up to 50
mph to Methuen. Three people were reported struck by lightning in
the Merrimack Valley and one was listed in critical condition today.
   As of 10 a.m. today, the temperature in Boston had reached only
70 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, compared to
Thursday's high of 92 degrees at Logan International Airport.
   About 10,000 Massachusetts Electric Co. customers in Methuen,
Lawrence and Dracut were without power for up to five hours
Thursday night, utility spokesman Ken Larson said
   The cold front gave the Chicago area relief from 90-degree heat
on Wednesday, dropping Thursday's high to 82, but temperatures were
expected to rise back into the 90s on Sunday, said Jim Vermoch, a
weather service meteorologist.
   The cooling trend brought Chicago no relief from the drought.
The area is in its 24th day without rain, added to an already
abnormally dry spring, and is about 6 inches short of the normal
14{ inches of rain it usually gets by this time of year, he said.
   And farther west, a new round of heat was building on the
Plains, with thermometers expected to go as high as 103 today in
western South Dakota.

   Former Brooklyn Democratic boss Meade Esposito,
his daughter and a business partner handed out bribes and kickbacks
to ensure business for their printing company, according to an
indictment that also charges them with tax fraud.
   In an 18-count indictment, they also were accused of laundering
more than $250,000 through a phony invoice scam to obtain cash for
the bribes and personal use, U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said
Thursday.
   The indictment issued by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn
outlined a scheme that alleged the three paid $200,000 in bribes
and kickbacks.
   Esposito, 81, was described as a silent partner of the printing
company, Beaumont Offset Corp. of Farmingdale, N.Y. The other
defendants are Harry Dickran, president of Beaumont; and Phyllis
Zito, Esposito's daughter and secretary-treasurer of the company.
   The charges are an offshoot of the investigation that led to
Esposito's conviction last September for giving an illegal gratuity
to U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., Maloney said. Esposito is
appealing the conviction.
   ``He is an intimate part of a long continuing fraud on the
government,'' Maloney said of Esposito.
   Esposito's lawyer, Edward Brodsky, said his client was innocent
of the charges. Esposito was a powerful party boss from 1969 until
1984.
   ``Although he is now 81 years old and not in good health, he
will go to trial and prove to the entire world that he is not
guilty,'' Brodsky said.
   A woman who answered the phone at Beaumont said the company's
attorney was not available for comment.
   The three are charged with violating interstate travel laws to
commit bribery, making false statements on Beaumont's tax returns
and conspiracy to make false statements on tax returns.
   Dickran and Mrs. Zito were also charged with making false
statements on their personal income tax returns.

<TEXT>
   Aides to George Bush say the vice president's
office will stop mailing campaign speeches to news organizations at
public expense, a Baltimore newspaper reported today.
   The Evening Sun said that after it inquired about the practice
Bush aides called such mailings a mistake and said future campaign
speeches would be sent only by Bush's presidential campaign
organization.
   Bush's chief vice presidential press aide, Stephen Hart, told
the newspaper that the office has for a long time been mailing
statements of Bush's remarks, including campaign-related remarks,
to news organizations.
   ``We serve the national press corps, people who are interested
in what the vice president says,'' Hart said. ``I will say that
practice has now been reviewed and will change, not because it's
wrong but because ... it could cause some misperception.''
   Hart said he wasn't familiar with the law covering such mailings
but didn't believe they were illegal.
   ``I have been told that this is a standard practice that has
been engaged in for some time by previous administrations,'' he
said.
   According to Bush's new campaign press secretary, Sheila Tate,
the vice president was unaware of any campaign mailings from his
vice presidential office. She said such mailings should come from
the campaign office.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules White Minority In Birmingham Has Voting Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a twist on a tactic generally used to
increase black representation, Birmingham's white minority has won
a ruling allowing it to challenge at-large local elections for
allegedly diluting white votes.
   Similar suits filed by blacks have thrown out at-large election
systems in many other cities as violations of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act.
   U.S. District Judge Robert B. Propst signed a ruling Thursday
rejecting the city's request to throw out the suit, which seeks to
impose single-member district elections for the nine-member City
Council.
   Propst's ruling sets the stage for trial of the lawsuit,
possibly this fall, and holds that voting rights law applies to
white minorities in the same way it has protected blacks who once
were a minority in a segregated Birmingham.
   ``The court finds no substantial indication in the act or in its
legislative history which suggests that some minority races are not
protected by it,'' said Propst.
   ``If it were so, it would be contrary to other civil rights
legislation which may have been spawned by virtue of well-known and
blatant discrimination against blacks, but the reach of which
extends to both black and white,'' he said.
   The suit was filed by a biracial group that claims the Jefferson
County Citizens Coalition, led by black Mayor Richard Arrington,
has turned Birmingham's white voters into an oppressed minority.
   Donald Watkins, the city's attorney in the case, said he was not
surprised by the ruling.
   ``Ever since the first hearing before Judge Propst (in
December), my clients have realized and been prepared to go the
long haul on this case,'' Watkins said. ``We are prepared to go the
distance.''
   The city claims that the election of three white council members
proves that whites are not shut out of the at-large system.
   Jack Harrison, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the city has
not been willing to negotiate. He declined comment on the judge's
ruling.
   Propst rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the lawsuit is not a
racial issue and gave the biracial group's attorneys 10 days to
show why its three black members should not be dismissed from the
action.
   That would leave only the white voters' claim that their voting
strength is being diluted by black bloc voting.

<HEAD>Cincinnati Opera Edits Swaggart Speech Out of Radio Spot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati Opera said it has responded to
public criticism by revamping a radio commercial to remove an
excerpt of the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart's public admission that he had
sinned.
   The original commercial, in which Swaggart was heard to say, ``I
do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin. I have no one but
myself to blame,'' was never aired.
   It was supposed to start being broadcast Thursday, but the
company pulled it, edited Swaggart out and will begin airing the
new version Saturday, Kathy Neus, the opera company's public
relations manager, said today.
   Ms. Neus said the opera company and advertising agency who
created the radio spot received about two dozen calls criticizing
it, based on advance publicity.
   The opera had no intention of offending anyone, she stressed.
   The advertisement promotes the company's June 30 and July 2
performances of Carlisle Floyd's 1956 opera ``Susannah,'' in which
an isolated young women is seduced by a hypocritical backwoods
Tennessee preacher.
   ``It's basically the same kind of commercial,'' Ms. Neus said
Thursday of the edited spot. ``It just doesn't have Swaggart.''
   The promotional campaign also included a television
advertisement that did not mention Swaggart, Ms. Neus said.
   Swaggart, a Louisiana-based television preacher, made the public
admission of sin in a February speech to his congregation. He never
specified the sin, but he was reported to have met several times
with a prostitute at a New Orleans motel to watch her perform
sexual acts. He has not denied those reports.
   William Treeby, a New Orleans lawyer who is a board member of
Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, said his organization did not plan to
take any legal action against the company.
   ``They have withdrawn all their advertisement and they've
apologized,'' Treeby said Thursday.
   Ms. Neus said the opera had not apologized. ``It was just in
fun. We were hoping to attract people to the opera.''

   A British man set off Friday on a renewed

   Geoff Cooper, 36, rowed away from this Cornish port in his
16-foot boat Water Rat I. He was confident, despite previous
failures.
   A 1986 attempt ended after just 36 hours when Cooper injured a
wrist and had to be airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.
   Last year, he was again rescued by a helicopter when he got into
trouble off the Cornish coast during a practice trip.
   He said he hoped to complete the 36,000-mile voyage in three
years.
   ``All you need is a little luck, and it was against me
previously,'' Cooper said.
   Cooper, who is carrying radio equipment, is planning to row west
around the world.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Government-Owned Artworks Said To Be Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of works of art that
decorated the walls of Dutch offices around the world are missing,
the government says, and some of the paintings may even have ended
up in the trash.
   Koos de Jong, who oversees the government's collection of
360,000 works of art, said he discovered the pieces were missing
when he took an inventory recently. He was quoted Friday by the
Amsterdam daily De Volkskrant.
   About 165,000 pieces had been lent to government offices and
embassies around the world and many never came back, he said.
   The government began collecting the works under a post-World War
II program to support Dutch artists. The collection also includes
antiques and paintings by masters of the 17th, 18th and 19th
centuries.
   ``There may be several thousand _ I can't predict for sure _
that are certainly gone,'' de Jong told De Volkskrant. ``Artworks
got lost or were irreparably damaged because of ill-treatment.''
   De Jong is head of collections for the Dutch National Pictorial
Arts Service. He did not disclose a damage figure, and the article
did not provide details on the missing art.
   ``In the old days, it was possible (for government officials) to
come and collect paintings or bits of furniture from the national
depot just as they pleased,'' De Jong said.
   ``Even now, it can still happen that a work given on loan years
ago becomes part of somebody's inventory and ends up among the
garbage when the office is being moved or redecorated,'' he said.
   De Jong's service itself recently moved to new quarters in The
Hague from an old Amsterdam warehouse where much of the collection
lay gathering dust.
   Today, the art is carefully stored on specially designed racks
in air-conditioned rooms.

   Government troops clashed with
communist rebels in the southern and northern Philippines, and at
least 21 guerrillas and seven soldiers were killed, the military
said Friday.
   The biggest battle occurred in Mindanao island's Surigao del Sur
province, where 12 New People's Army guerrillas and seven soldiers
were killed in two hours of fighting Thursday, a military spokesman
said.
   On Bohol island, 380 miles southeast of Manila, soldiers killed
two rebels after a group of guerrillas ambushed the troops
Thursday, a military report said.
   Also Thursday, in Luzon island's Ilocos Norte province,
government troops ambushed a rebel band on its way to attack a
military detachment and killed seven insurgents, officials said.
   In Manila, unidentified men Friday shot and wounded a Philippine
Constabulary trooper guarding a school for children of foreigners
living in the country, police said. The three assailants escaped in
a car after the officer, Virgilio Fulache, shot and seriously
wounded one of them.
   Police said Fulache was returning to his post outside the
International School when a man fired on him and hit him in the
right hand. Fulache managed to draw his gun and fired back at the
assailant, who was hit and fell on the ground.
   Two other men then fired on Fulache, hitting him in the left and
right thighs, but the soldier fought back, investigators said. The
two men then helped their wounded companion to a car and drove away.
   No one else was reported injured in the incident. The students
at the school were on vacation.
   Lt. Col. Edgar Centino, spokesman for the 4th Infantry Division,
told reporters in the Mindanao city of Cagayan de Oro that 15
rebels and six soldiers were wounded in the fighting in Surigao del
Sur.
   He said the battle began after troops on patrol spotted a rebel
camp near the mountain village of Diatagon, 540 miles southeast of
Manila. The soldiers fired mortar shells onto the camp and its
estimated 70 occupants fought back, he said.
   Centino said the soldiers claimed they saw a white man acting as
``military consultant'' to the rebels during the battle.
   ``Our soldiers were not certain of the nationality of the
Caucasian, but they insist he was a foreigner,'' Centino said.
   The claim comes at a time of increasing allegations by the
military that foreigners are helping train communist rebels and are
taking part in attacks on military detachments and other government
installations.
   Last week, the military arrested a Swede and a West German on
charges they were seen taking part in a rebel raid in February on
the town of San Francisco in Quezon province.
   The two, Stellan Hermansson, president of the Swedish Young
Communist League, and Klaus Schmidt, a Protestant minister, have
denied the charges.
   In the Ilocos Norte town of Pasuquin, 255 miles north of Manila,
Capt. Oscar Vivit said soldiers ambushed a band of rebels on their
way to attack a military detachment and killed seven insurgents.
Two soldiers were wounded.
   Vivit said the troops positioned themselves for the ambush after
they were tipped off about the planned rebel raid on their camp.
   Another military report said rebels ambushed soldiers as they
were traveling aboard two trucks on Bohol island.
   Six of the soldiers were wounded in the attack but they managed
to fire back on their ambushers and killed two, the report said.

   A 26-year Navy veteran who is the command
master chief of enlisted men on the aircraft carrier Theodore
Roosevelt has been tapped to become the next master chief petty
officer of the Navy, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost announced Friday.
   Trost, the chief of naval operations, said he had selected
Master Chief Avionics Technician Duane R. Bushey to become his top
adviser on all issues involving enlisted personnel.
   The new top enlisted man for the Navy will assume his duties in
September. He will replace Master Chief William H. Plackett, who
has held the post for the past two years and who is retiring after
32 years of active service.
   Bushey, 44, is a native of Lebanon, N.H., but graduated from
Wicomico Senior High School in Salisbury, Md. He enlisted in the
Navy in June 1962 and moved immediately into the field of air
warfare avionics, graduating from the Aviation Electrician's School
in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Since then, he has held a variety of posts both at sea on
aircraft carriers and at naval air stations. He has been in charge
of enlisted personnel on the Theodore Roosevelt since October 1985.
   Bushey is married to the former Susan W. Prause of Oakland,
Calif., and the couple has two sons.

<TEXT>
   The government has underestimated the strength of
religion in the Soviet Union and should set the record straight,
four prominent intellectuals said in a letter published Friday.
   Publication of the letter in Pravda, the Communist Party
newspaper, indicated at least some official support. It appeared on
the day the Soviet Union ended its two-week celebration of the
1,000th anniversary of the arrival of Christianity in what is now
the Soviet Union.
   Those signing the letter were sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya;
literary critic and translator Sergei Averintsev; Ales Adamovich, a
Byelorussian writer, and physicist Boris Raushenbach. All are
strong supporters of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to reform Soviet
society.
   ``It is necessary once and for all to interpret the church in
our country as a huge and complicated social phenomenon,'' they
wrote.
   The writers said religion must be an important part of Soviet
life if the ``customary dogma'' of atheist propaganda cannot
curtail the religious consciousness of millions of citizens.
   ``Figures on the number of believers, reported by regional and
republican authorities in the Council on Religious Affairs of the
U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers patently, don't correspond to
reality,'' the letter said.
   A truer indication of its strength, the writers declared, is the
35 million rubles ($56 million) the Russian Orthodox Church
contributes each year to the Soviet Peace Fund, an official charity.
   Western experts in the field believe there are tens of millions
of religious people in the Soviet Union.
   In their letter to Pravda, the four intellectuals proposed using
the propaganda apparatus that preaches atheism to study ``the real
situation of religious consciousness of citizens of the U.S.S.R.,
to provide not illusory, but a reliable, scientifically based
conception of this subject.''
   The constitution guarantees freedom of worship but it also
guarantees freedom of anti-religious propaganda, which is carried
out in schools, official publications and elsewhere.
   A 1929 law on the relationship between state and church was
adopted ``in the period of huge social deformations,'' the letter
said in an indirect criticism of dictator Josef Stalin, who was in
power at the time.
   Under that law, religious groups must register with the
government and cannot do charitable work. It also restricts
religious education.
   Thousands of churches were destroyed under Stalin and many
priests were imprisoned or killed.
   Gorbachev told Patriarch Pimen, head of the Russian Orthodox
Church, in April that a new law on ``freedom of conscience'' was
being prepared.
   No details have been released. Konstantin Kharchev, chairman of
the government's Council on Religious Affairs, refused to say when
the law would be ready but told a news conference Friday: ``There
is no doubt it will be done quickly.''
   He said the law on religion and other changes under the reform
program Gorbachev calls perestroika, or restructuring, will guard
against suppression of the church.
   ``This sorrowful past will not be repeated,'' Kharchev said.
``Everything will be done so as not to allow a repetition.''

   Fire broke out today at a plant where
chlorine was stored, spreading fumes through the area and forcing
the evacuation of 1,800 people, including children at three
schools, officials said.
   There were no reports of serious injuries, but Fire Department
spokesman Giorgio Placanico said nine firefighters were overcome by
fumes in the hot, humid weather. One worker at the plant may have
been affected also, he said.
   Fire Chief Raymond J. Sullivan said rain from an early morning
thunderstorm apparently blew into a chlorine hopper at the Advanced
Laboratories plant, sparking a chemical reaction and small fire
that sent chlorine fumes through the neighborhood shortly after 10
a.m.
   Firefighters, using soda ash, quickly quenched the blaze and an
area within a quarter of a mile of the three-story brick plant was
evacuated as a precaution, he said.
   More than 1,200 children at three elementary schools were taken
by bus to junior high schools, said Durham Caldwell, a spokesman
for the city school system. Caldwell said the evacuation was
orderly and none of the children were reported to have been
affected by the fumes.

   Farmers suffering from what may be the
state's worst dry spell since the 1930s are shipping $6,500 worth
of their grain to drought-stricken farmers 8,000 miles away in
Niger.
   ``Crops aren't that great here, but the way I feel about it is
if you concentrate on somebody else's problems that are worse than
yours, your own problems ... your own disasters are much less,''
said Duane Burchill of Page.
   Some 1,666 bushels of wheat were brought to a seed cleaning
plant Thursday and placed in 100-pound bags for shipment to central
Africa. The wheat is going by rail to Houston, and then to Africa.
   About $2,000 in cash and pledges were received from area
churches for the project. The grain is being donated through Church
World Services-CROP in Fargo to meet a request by leaders in Niger.
   Because of the drought, wheat prices have increased from about
$2.80 a bushel, when the commitments were made, to about $4 a
bushel.
   ``It turned out to be a dramatic thing, when the crop looks so
bad, when prices look so good,'' said Roger Livdahl, Fargo
coordinator of Church World Services-CROP. ``It turned out to be
much more of a sacrifice than it originally been.''
   ``Well, I don't know if it's a sacrifice,'' said Burchill,
``because all the wheat we own ... ald.

<HEAD>Mail Handlers Union President Charged With Embezzlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has charged the
president of the Mail Handlers union with embezzling nearly
$100,000 of union money, authorities said.
   Herbert Walker, 45, president of the Post Office Mail Handlers,
Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders, also is accused of making
false reports in union records.
   The indictment, announced Thursday, alleges that Walker, of
Cincinnati, embezzled $99,077 for his own use from 1983 to 1985
while he was president of the union's Local 304, which represents
3,200 workers in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
   Walker could not be reached for comment; his telephone number is
not published. A receptionist at the postal union's national office
in Washington, D.C., said no one in there could comment.
   Prosecutors allege Walker deposited Local 304 checks in his bank
account, rather than in the union's account. They also contend he
wrote checks to himself from the local's account and altered
records to make it appear as though the checks were written for
union expenses.
   Prosecutors said Walker would face a maximum 198 years in
prison, fines of $500,000 and $2,500 in other assessments, if
convicted. Walker also would be prohibited from serving as an
officer, director, trustee or member of the executive board of any
union for 13 years, prosecutors said.
   In 1987, Walker was elected president of the 50,000-member
national union and moved to Washington. Meanwhile, the national
union was put into trusteeship for alleged mismanagement of funds.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Utah Sen. Frank Moss is seeking to
revive interest in a massive project, proposed in the 1960s, to
transport water south from Alaska and Canada.
   ``Perhaps the current drought will spur some action toward
long-term solutions like the North American Water and Power
Alliance,'' Moss said at a news conference Friday.
   The project calls for canals to draw water from north-flowing
rivers and to transport it south to help irrigate the agricultural
regions of Canada, the United States and northern Mexico.
   But Moss admitted that the project is no immediate solution to
the drought now plaguing North America. It would take an about 20
years to complete the project at a cost estimated, in 1964, of $80
billion. Based simply on inflation, that would translate to a cost
of $303 billion today.
   The environmental impact of transferring billions of gallons of
water from one region to another also has not been studied,
acknowledged Moss and Nicholas F. Benton, who said he represented a
committee promoting the project.
   Benton, who described himself as a journalist for the Century
News Service, contended that plenty of water is available in the
north.
   However, he was unable to produce any figures to back that
assertion.

<HEAD>Judges Denies Petition to Delay Simmons Execution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL SIMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OZARK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today denied a petition to delay the
execution of a man convicted of two murders and accused of 14
others while appeals on his behalf are considered.
   The ruling by Circuit Judge John F. Patterson came despite
testimony at a hearing this morning from a psychiatrist who said he
was having second thoughts about his earlier judgment that R. Gene
Simmons was competent and responsible for his actions when the
slayings occurred last December.
   ``Mr. Simmons seems more competent than most of the testimony
that I've heard here today,'' Patterson said in denying the
petition filed on behalf of the Rev. Louis Franz of Star City,
representing a group called Arkansas Churches for Life.
   The judge also denied a motion to appeal Simmons' conviction and
sentence.
   Franz and his attorney, Mark Cambiano of Morrilton, filed the
petition to stop the execution in an effort to assure an appeal of
Simmons' May 12 conviction for killing two people in a Dec. 28
shooting rampage at Russellville.
   After he was sentenced, Simmons read a statement asking that he
be executed quickly and that no appeals be filed on his behalf.
   Simmons is scheduled to die by injection June 27. He also is
charged with two counts of capital murder in the deaths of 14
family members whose bodies were found t the Simmons home in a
rural area near Dover, north of Russellville. Trial on those
charges is scheduled for July 18.
   Dr. Irving Kuo, a psychiatrist at the State Hospital in Little
Rock, testified today that he began to have doubts about Simmons'
competence after receiving a letter Simmons wrote in response to a
letter Kuo sent him after the trial last month.
   ``Officials are starting to play their little games,'' Simmons
said in the letter to Kuo. The psychiatrist said that suggests
Simmons has some characteristics of paranoia.
   Simmons' lawyers, John C. Harris and Robert E. ``Doc'' Irwin,
and prosecutor John Bynum attacked Kuo's new opinion.
   ``If this letter demonstrates anything at all, all it
demonstrates is that he may be getting a little bit paranoid, a
little bit tired,'' Bynum said.
   Kuo said Bynum's opinion represented one possibility, but that
others were that ``he has been paranoid and is becoming more
paranoid'' and ``he has been paranoid and it's coming out more in
the open.''
   Kuo's letter to Simmons had asked for information about what
motivated Simmons in his crimes, saying the request was for
personal and professional curiosity and to obtain information that
might be published in a scientific journal.
   Simmons has said in letters to newspapers that he doesn't want
Franz to be allowed to intervene, and he accused Cambiano of trying
to make a name for himself in Arkansas legal history.

<HEAD>UN Council Schedules Emergency Meeting On `Sharpeville Six'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with Security Council
resolution; picks up 4th pvs: In March...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Friday unanimously
adopted a resolution appealing to the South African government to
stay the executions of six black prisoners.
   The United States, which sometimes vetoes measures to shield
South Africa, declined to exercise its veto and allowed the mercy
plea to pass. It was a clear signal to the Pretoria government of
Washington's displeasure with plans to execute the so-called
``Sharpeville Six.''
   On Thursday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appealed
for clemency.
   The council said it was convinced that the executions, if
carried out, would ``further inflame an already grave situation in
South Africa.''
   It called ``once again upon the South African authorities to
stay execution and commute the death sentences imposed on the
Sharpeville Six.''
   In March the 15-member Security Council appealed to the South
African government to grant clemency to the six. The council
frequently condemns South Africa for its system of apartheid but
South Africa says the U.N. group has no right to interfere in
domestic affairs.
   The six were convicted of participating in a 1984 riot in which
a black Sharpeville town councilor was killed. But they were not
found to have joined in the physical assault.
   The members of the council are the United States, Britain,
China, France and the Soviet Union _ the permanent five nuclear
powers _ and Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,
Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.
   The United States frequently vetoes Security Council
denunciations of South Africa and its calls for sanctions against
the government. But the United States sometimes declines to
exercise its veto and allows certain critical resolutions to pass.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million black majority has no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>White House Says Welfare Veto Still Possible Unless Congress Toes
the Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Friday refused to
endorse a landmark Senate welfare bill and said a veto still was
possible due to potential welfare demands in the House ``far out of
line with our judgment.''
   The Senate bill, passed 93-3 on Thursday, carries a five-year
price tag of about $2.8 billion, while the House plan, passed
narrowly in December, is much more generous and would cost $7
billion.
   ``It is a case of Sisyphus having to push the rock up the
mountain at this point,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters Friday. ``We will try to get changes in the
conference (between House and Senate negotiators), but it's going
to be very tough to reconcile with the House bill that is so far
out of line with our judgment.''
   Both the Senate and House bills are designed to turn the
country's Depression-era welfare system into a jobs program with a
rigorous child support collections component. Government assistance
would be a last and temporary resort.
   Negotiators from each chamber will start meeting in two to three
weeks to try to reconcile the two bills. They expect to have a
compromise measure on the president's desk by Labor Day.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., sponsor of the House plan, which gives
more money to the jobs program, said he would try to retain a
higher spending level than called for by the Senate.
   ``If you're going to have a meaningful work program, you have to
be prepared to help finance it,'' Downey said.
   Downey also said a House plan to offer financial incentives to
states that raise cash benefits, which are very low in some places,
would be ``hotly fought and contested'' in the House-Senate
conference.
   Despite those difficulties, Downey said he was optimistic that
an acceptable compromise could be struck ``if the administration
will sign a welfare bill that is something similar to the Senate
bill. Then maybe we can work out a deal.''
   Fitzwater indicated, however, that the administration had not
yet decided whether the Senate bill, even with revisions sought by
the White House, was acceptable.
   ``We still have some problems with the bill,'' he said, but
added that White House officials would examine the changes that
were made Thursday in response to their demands.
   Senators agreed to compromises on two major concerns raised by
Reagan. One provision says that by 1994, state jobs, education and
training programs must be serving 22 percent of eligible
participants.
   The other, more controversial provision requires that states
create workfare programs, or community work projects, and require
part-time participation for one adult in each two-parent family on
welfare.
   ``It's the first time a welfare bill has ever been passed that
includes a federal requirement for work in association with
welfare, and in that sense we believe it is a very important
concept to be established in law,'' Fitzwater said.
   But governors generally oppose the provision, as do Downey and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., author of the Senate bill.
Moynihan said governors consider it costly and counterproductive,
especially in states with strong labor markets.

<HEAD>OSHA Tightens Regulations on Concrete, Masonry Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration on Friday tightened its regulations on concrete and
masonary construction, saying its new standards will save the lives
of 120 workers a year.
   The new regulations, in the making since 1982, require
additional bracing of concrete and masonry walls and more thorough
testing of concrete to assure that it has hardened sufficiently
before braces are removed or loads are put on it.
   The changes were prompted by a 1978 accident in which 51
construction workers plunged to their deaths when scaffolding
anchored in uncured concrete collapsed on a power plant cooling
tower being built at Willow Island, W.Va.
   A similar accident occurred in 1973 when 14 workers were killed
and 34 were injured because of the premature removal of forms
supporting the 23rd floor of an apartment building under
construction in Fairfax County, Va.
   However, the new OSHA regulations do not address the
controversial ``lift-slab'' construction practice involved in the
collapse last year of the half-built L'Ambiance Plaza apartment
complex in Bridgeport, Conn., which killed 28 workers.
   As with the Willow Island and Fairfax County accidents, OSHA
officials determined that the L'Ambiance Plaza collapse would not
have occurred had the contractors involved been complying with
existing federal regulations.
   Officials said Friday that new safety requirements for
``lift-slab'' construction _ a process in which floor and roof
slabs are cast on the ground and then jacked upward into position _
will not be proposed until later this year.
   They said the agency is reopening the issue because of new
technical information arising out of the investigation of the
L'Ambiance Plaza accident.
   The new regulations, to take effect in 60 days, update 1971
standards to prohibit premature removal of forms, require bracing
for masonry walls for the first time, mandate supports for precast
panels and establish limited access zones around wall construction
areas.
   In addition, they recognize new methods for testing concrete
and, to prevent workers from being impaled, require that protective
coverings be placed over exposed reinforcement bars or that the
bars be bent over.
   ``The changes also remove ambiguities in the old rules, making
it easier and less expensive for employers to protect their
employees,'' said John Pendergrass, assistant labor secretary and
OSHA administrator.
   In addition to saving 120 lives a year, OSHA officials estimate
that the new regulations will prevent 7,000 on-the-job injuries
annually among the nation's 3.8 million construction workers.
   Compliance is expected to cost contractors an additional $38.2
million a year. But officials said savings from less property
damage, construction delays and insurance premiums asa result of
fewer accidents are expected to total nearly $350 million annually.
   OSHA estimated that about 80 percent of the nearly 250,000
masonry and concrete contractors in the country have fewer than 10
employees and that the cost to those firms would average only $339
a year _ ``a small price to pay for saving lives and reducing the
number of injuries,'' Pendergrass said.
   Many of the specific changes in the regulations were recommended
or endorsed by construction unions.
   However, Jim Lapping, a safety specialist for the AFL-CIO's
Building and Construction Trades Department, said there was no
reason to delay the new regulations on lift-slab construction.
   ``The ANSI (American National Standards Institute) committee has
made its recommendations and there is plenty of information on the
record,'' Lapping said. ``But this administration has not been
noted to responding quickly or to our advice. We still don't have a
tunnel standard that was proposed in 1972.''
   Lapping said the building trade unions support legislation
introduced Thursday by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Rep.
Christopher Shays, both R-Conn., that would criminalize
construction safety law violations and require a professional
engineer to oversee all work.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Sam Nunn said Friday he told Michael
Dukakis' campaign chairman this week he's not interested in the
vice presidential nomination.
   Nunn, D-Ga., didn't rule out accepting such an offer, saying in
an interview it would be ``very presumptuous'' to respond to
hypothetical questions about what he would do if the No. 2 spot
were offered by Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
   However, he said, ``It's not my desire to have that job offered
to me and then to turn it down. I don't think that's good for the
process'' or for Dukakis.
   Nunn was among the members of Congress who met individually this
week with Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman, to discuss the
vice presidency.
   The Georgian, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he has talked with Dukakis at length on the
telephone in recent weeks about national security issues. But he
said the only time he has talked with the Massachusetts governor
about the vice presidency was when Dukakis told him Brountas would
be contacting him during his tour of Capitol Hill.
   Nunn said he got the impression from talking with Brountas that
Dukakis hasn't decided exactly what he is looking for in a vice
presidential nominee, either politically or in terms of what role
the vice president would play in his administration.
   Asked directly if he would accept a spot on the ticket if asked
by Dukakis, Nunn said, ``I think it's very presumptuous to sort of
set up a hypothetical example of what one would do if one were
offered something that one is not seeking and one is discouraging.''
   ``So I haven't gone to the extent of making a Sherman-like
statement. I feel it's kind of presumptuous and at this stage
unnecessary,'' he said.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
met Friday with U.N. delegates about the nearly $700 million that
member countries owe the United Nations, a debt that U.N. officials
said could close the organization.
   The secretary-general consulted with Eastern European delegates
on Friday. Earlier in the week, he met with Western European, Asian
and Latin American delegates and is expected to meet with African
delegates next week.
   Perez de Cuellar and U.N. staff officials have said the United
Nations could become insolvent by late October if members don't pay
what they owe.
   The United States is responsible for most of the debt. It owes
$467 million of the $691 million outstanding.
   Most of the U.S. money has been withheld in the past few years
due to congressional disagreements with U.N. policies and
operations and in an attempt to influence Soviet personnel policy
at the world body.
   The Soviet Union has launched a campaign over the past year to
increase its influence and standing at the United Nations. It has
paid off about $60 million in arrears to the regular budget and is
beginning to repay about $200 million it owed for peacekeeping
operations, which come under a separate budget.
   The United States has traditionally been assessed one-fourth of
the annual U.N. budget of nearly $1 billion. The U.N. money comes
from assessments of member nations, which are based on the nations'
wealth.
   Congress in 1985 passed an amendment to the budget bill,
sponsored by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., that allows the withholding of part of the U.S. dues to the
United Nations.
   Part of the dues are paid when assessed, but the majority are
withheld until the president informs Congress that adequate
progress is being made on cutting the U.N. staff by 15 percent and
other budgetary reforms and that more Soviet U.N. employees are
shifted from short-term contracts to long-term international civil
servant status.
   The goal of the U.S. demand for the Soviet personnel policy
change is to make Soviet staff loyal to the international civil
service and independent of Moscow's goals.
   Until recently, nearly all Soviets were rotated through the
United Nations on contracts of fewer than five years. In May,
however, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Petrovsky,
announced that more Soviets would be allowed to sign ``permanent
contracts'' with the U.N. Secretariat.
   That statement would appear to meet the last serious objection
that U.S. officials had to paying the full U.N. dues assessment.
   Satisfactory progress has been made on the personnel cuts and
budgetary reforms, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   One U.N. staff official suggested that if the United States
continued to withhold funds, perhaps the Soviets would allow the
early payment of the second half of their annual dues, which they
usually pay in October.

   Pat Robertson on Friday urged
conservative Minnesota Republicans who supported his presidential
candidacy to back Vice President George Bush in the November
election.
   ``It matters whether the man in the White House is a mediocre
liberal who returns us to the policies of Jimmy Carter, or a
distinguished conservative who builds upon the foundation of a
great Republican, Ronald Reagan,'' he said.
   Robertson, who has returned to religious broadcasting since
dropping out of the Republican presidential race, received an
enthusiastic welcome from the approximately 2,000 delegates at the
state convention. He placed second to Sen. Bob Dole in Minnesota's
Feb. 23 caucuses.
   Robertson received a standing ovation when he attacked
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has sewn up the Democratic
presidential nomination, as a member of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``I don't want a president in the White House putting in ACLU
lawyers as federal judges and Supreme Court judges,'' Robertson
said. ``We absolutely must oppose him on that ground.''
   Robertson told a news conference before his speech that he's
``delighted with the sense of harmony'' among Republicans he sees
within every state he visits.
   ``I'm looking forward to George Bush's election,'' he said. ``I
know it will be close, but I believe the gap between George Bush
and Michael Dukakis will be closing.''
   Robertson said he prefers Dole for Bush's running mate.
   ``A Bush-Dole ticket would be virtually unbeatable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,700 guerrillas jailed in
Uganda's civil conflict were freed today, the government announced.
   The release is expected to bolster President Yoweri Museveni's
efforts to organize peace talks with rebel armies fighting his
government in the north and east, Western analysts told The
Associated Press.
   The Internal Affairs Ministry said Museveni had ordered that
1,671 prisoners of war be discharged from prisons.
   Most of the prisoners were fighting for the Uganda People's
Democratic Movement, a northern-based guerrilla force. They were
held without charge after being captured in clashes with government
troops.
   Museveni evidently ordered their release as a concession to
guerrilla leaders with whom government envoys have made contact in
a bid for peace in Uganda. The country that has been convulsed by
civil conflicts almost constantly since its independence from
Britain on Oct. 9, 1962.
   Museveni seized power in January 1986, ending a five-year war
against civilian president Milton Obote and the military junta that
ousted Obote in July 1985. Museveni formed a government of national
unity, inviting four other rival parties to join his cabinet.
   In September and October 1986 soldiers arrested several men on
treason charges of plotting a coup. Courts have released most of
the men for lack of evidence.
   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,
including former military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted guerrilla
operations against Museveni's government since August 1986.
   Amin lives in exile in Saudi Arabia and Obote in Britain.

   The Security Council on Friday appealed to
the South African government to grant mercy to the Sharpeville Six,
who have been sentenced to hang for the death of a town councilor.
   The United States, which sometimes vetoes measures against South
Africa, joined in the plea. It was a clear signal to the Pretoria
government of Washington's displeasure with plans to carry out the
death sentences.
   The resolution was adopted unanimously without debate. The
15-member council said it was convinced the executions would
``further inflame an already grave situation in South Africa.''
   It called ``once again upon the South African authorities to
stay execution and commute the death sentences imposed on the
Sharpeville Six.'' It was the second time in three months the
council has passed such a resolution.
   South African Ambassador A. Leslie Manley criticized the action.
``This is blatant interference in the internal affairs of a member
state of the United Nations,'' Manley said.
   South Africa has ignored worldwide appeals for clemency for the
six blacks, who were convicted in the 1984 death of a Sharpeville
town councilor killed during a riot. They were not found guilty of
physical involvement in the slaying but were convicted on the basis
of their involvement with the rioters.
   ``This council decision was taken in contravention of the
charter of the U.N. This is entirely an internal matter which is
the subject of due process of law in South Africa,'' Manley said in
a telephone interview.
   The Dutch government Friday also urged South Africa to commute
the death sentences. South African Ambassador Frank Quint was
summoned to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, where top official Henri
Wijnaendts asked for clemency for the five men and one woman.
   A stay of execution was granted March 17, the day before the six
were to hang, and last week a judge extended the stay until July 19
but rejected a request to reopen their trial.
   On March 16, the Security Council adopted a resolution identical
to that approved Friday.
   The council expressed ``grave concern'' at the deteriorating
situation in South Africa, saying the human suffering resulted from
the apartheid system of racial segregation and the state of
emergency.
   The members of the council are the United States, Britain,
China, France, the Soviet Union, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy,
Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

Shifts</HEAD>

   Congress tried to slow down the movement of
Defense Department procurement officials to civilian defense
contractors with a 1987 law.
   But a growing investigation of possible Pentagon and contractor
bribery raises questions about how the revolving door law is
working.
   The law says Pentagon procurement officials must wait two years
after leaving the government before the may work for defense
contractors with whom they had major contact in the last two years
of federal service.
   Since the statute did not take effect until April 15, 1987, it
is not clear how many of those involved in the budding Pentagon
investigation were covered by the law's restrictions. There were
reports that some Pentagon officials quit before the effective date
to avoid its provisions.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a sponsor of the legislation, has
asked the Pentagon's deputy inspector general, Derek Vander Schaaf,
to determine ``whether there is cause to believe'' that anyone
named by the FBI as under investigation in the case may have
violated the revolving door law.
   One provision of the law applies to mid-level civilian or
military defense procurement officials. They fall under the
two-year ban if they spent the majority of their work during their
last two years at a defense contractor's plant, or working on a
major weapons system the contractor was selling.
   Another section forces the two-year waiting period on high-level
officials who acted as government representatives in the
negotiation or settlement of a contract of more than $10 million.
   This applies to anyone who was a decisionmaker, even if he did
not have official responsibility for the negotiations.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., a prime sponsor, said this
provision applied to cases such as the high-ranking Navy Department
officials who negotiated multimillion-dollar deals with General
Dynamics, and then went to work for that corporation.
   The law requires that companies submit to the secretary of
defense the names of former Pentagon officials now working for the
defense contractors.
   Penalty provisions include a civil fine of up to $500,000 for
companies offering compensation to an official it knows is covered
by the restrictions.
   The official can receive a civil fine of up to $250,000.
   When the 1987 law was passed, the strongest advocates of closing
the ``revolving door'' blamed the procurement system for the
problem _ not the integrity of individuals.
   Even that has changed, now that a search warrant has revealed
that the government is investigating the ``bribery of public
officials'' as part of a scheme in which defense contractors got
inside information from former government officials whom they had
hired as consultants.
   Taking note of the change, Boxer said in a floor speech this
week, ``Now, it is bad enough that such a situation undermines
public confidence in the procurement system.
   ``It is far worse to learn that former and current public
officials may have broken the law in a rush to cash in on the
contracts that they gained at taxpayers' expense. Nothing could be
lower than that.''
   An illustration of the revolving door is the case of Melvyn R.
Paisley, a major target in the current investigation.
   He left his Navy job in April 1987 to become a Washington
consultant, and some of the largest defense contractors lined up to
hire him.
   Paisley, 63, had played a key role in President Reagan's naval
build-up. As a private executive, he was selling information, a
commodity much in demand among the various companies seeking any
edge they could get in the competition to sell weapons to the
government.
   A General Accounting Office study in 1986 said more than 20
percent of the people who left jobs at the Pentagon in 1983 and
1984 to join defense contractors were spending at least some time
working on the same projects they had overseen for the government.
   The study said 45 percent of the former Pentagon employees said
their new jobs in industry required them to communicate with former
colleagues at the Pentagon, and 26 percent acknowledged they were
in positions to affect the work of their future employer during
their last two years at the Pentagon.

<HEAD>United States Protests Release of Suspected Terrorists by Senegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States protested to Senegal on
Friday for dropping charges against two Libyans arrested for
allegedly carrying explosives.
   ``The government of Senegal released, without trial, two known
Libyan terrorists caught red-handed in Dakar Airport last February
attempting to smuggle arms and explosives into Senegal,'' State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   The two men were sent back to Libya on Thursday, according to
official spokesmen in Dakar.
   ``We're extremely disappointed by Senegal's action,'' Redman
said. ``It raises questions about that country's commitment to the
struggle against international terrorism.''
   He said U.S. ``dissatisfaction'' was communicated through
diplomatic channels.
   The Libyans, Mohamed Abdou Salam and Mansour Oumrane, were
arrested on arrival in the West African country on Feb. 19 after
customs inspectors allegedly found the weapons in baggage.
   In past years, Senegal has criticized Libya for its involvement
in fighting in Chad, but Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, elected
to a second term recently, has said relations between his country
and Libya have ``considerably improved.''
   State Department officials have said the arrests in Senegal were
evidence of a possible renewal of terrorism sponsored by the Libyan
government of Moammar Gadhafi.
   The officials said Libyan involvement was suspected in attacks
in Europe and Asia earlier this spring, around the time of the
anniversary of the April 1985 U.S. bombing raid against Gadhafi
strongholds in Tripoli and Benghazi.

<HEAD>US Eases Ban on Payments to Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. government agencies and private firms
operating in Panama will be allowed to pay social security payroll
taxes to the Panamanian government for their Panamanian employees,
the State Department said Friday.
   Department spokesman Charles E. Redman described the decision as
an exemption to an April order by President Reagan halting all
payments to the Panamanian government by American citizens.
   Another official, who asked not to be identified, said the
exemption will provide about $3 million a month to the Panamanian
government.
   But he said the exemption would not necessarily be a net gain
for Panama, pointing out that the taxes are used to provide health
care to Panamanian workers and their families.
   Redman said the exemption was made for humanitarian purposes. He
said that ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the United
States continues to recognize as the legitimate authority in
Panama, had expressed concern about the possibility of severe
hardships for Panamanians who might otherwise have been denied
medical care at state facilities.
   Another official said some Panamanians already had been turned
away from these facilities because their U.S. employers had not
been contributing to the social security system.
   Redman said the exemption in no way reflects a softening of the
U.S. policy of bringing economic pressure to bear on the Panamanian
government. The administration's objective is to force Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, to surrender
power.
   Reagan had ordered a halt to all U.S. private and official
payments to the Panamanian government on April 8, invoking his
authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
   In addition to the ban on payments to the Panamanian government,
the administration also has effectively frozen all Panamanian
assets in the United States.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan's Parliament Rejects Annexation of Disputed Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of Azerbaijan refused Friday to
give up a region of the southern republic that Armenia has voted to
annex. A Soviet official said the dispute was at a deadlock.
   The decision by the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan was expected
because the republic's presidium, or executive committee, already
rejected Armenia's demand that Nagorno-Karabakh be made part of
Armenia. Soviet parliaments rarely go against the wishes of their
presidiums.
   The Tass news agency reported the decision and said the
parliament session was broadcast live on the republic's television
and radio stations. Western reporters have been barred from Armenia
and Azerbaijan since the dispute erupted earlier this year.
   The ethnic unrest led to bloodshed in February, when 32 people,
mostly Armenians, were killed in riots in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters that the dispute has taken the form of a ``collision''
between two articles of the Soviet Constitution.
   One article requires that any territorial changes be approved by
the republics involved and be ratified by the Supreme Soviet in
Moscow. Because Azerbaijan has refused to give its consent to the
change, it appears that under this article, the central Supreme
Soviet does not have to get involved.
   But Armenians cite another section of the constitution providing
for ``the free self-determination of nations and the voluntary
association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics.''
   Gerasimov acknowledged it is not clear how the constitutional
question can be resolved.
   ``There is a legal dispute going on about how these articles
should be implemented. ... So we have to wait (and see) how the
events develop and a fuller answer, therefore, will be given
later,'' he told reporters.
   The Supreme Soviet of neighboring Armenia voted Wednesday to
call for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, siding with Armenian
demonstrators who since February have been holding sporadic street
rallies, marches and strikes.
   Armenians consider the region part of their ancestral homeland.
More than three-quarters of its 160,000 residents are Armenians.
   A journalist for the Azerbaijan news agency Azerbinform said the
Supreme Soviet determined that giving up Nagorno-Karabakh would be
``contrary to the interests of the people.'' The journalist spoke
on condition he not be identified.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet, in its resolution, said a majority
of residents of Armenia and Nagorno-Krabakh want the region taken
out of Azerbaijan. The legislature asked its Azerbaijani
counterpart to approve the switch and the central Supreme Soviet in
Moscow to give its approval.
   Central Communist Party officials in Moscow rejected the
annexation demand in February, but the central Supreme Soviet has
not reviewed the issue.
   Gerasimov also said students had ended a sit-in they had
launched May 25 in Armenia's capital, Yerevan. Soviet newspapers,
however, have reported this week that unrest continues in
Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians in the
city have been marching and striking since May 23.
   The Soviet government made Nagorno-Karabakh an autonomous region
of Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Armenians are predominantly Christian. Most Azerbaijanis are
Moslem.

   Israeli soldiers fired on
stone-throwing Palestinians who tried to stop them from blowing up
an Arab's home Friday, killing one and wounding 18, hospital
officials and witnesses said.
   Army officials confirmed the death but said only four Arabs were
wounded. They said two soldiers were injured by stones in the
confrontation before dawn at Beit Furik, five miles southeast of
Nablus in the occupied West Bank.
   At least 209 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion that
began Dec. 8 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. An Israeli soldier and a
Jewish settler also have been slain.
   Troops demolished seven other homes in the West Bank and sealed
10 during a 24-hour period ending Friday. Most belonged to
Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs.
   Increased use of firebombs in recent weeks prompted army
officials to order harsher punishments, including house demolitions
and sealings. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said this week the
army considers firebombs lethal weapons to which soldiers and
Israeli civilians could respond with gunfire.
   Israeli soldiers entered Beit Furik at about 4 a.m. to destroy
the home of Ahmed Hanani, an alleged member of a gang that
assassinated Nablus Mayor Zafer Masri in March 1986 and carried out
attacks on Israelis, the army said.
   Rafaq Yusef Masmoud, a 25-year-old villager, said young men
guarding the village alerted residents with portable loudspeakers
and about 700 armed with rocks and bottles rushed into the streets
to face about 100 soldiers.
   He said the troopers opened fire and the ensuing street battle
continued for about four hours. Masmoud, who was shot in the right
leg, spoke to The Associated Press from his bed at Al Ittihad
Hospital in Nablus.
   The house was blown up about two hours after the Israelis
arrived and ``I saw a big cloud go up into the sky,'' Masmoud said.
``After the house exploded, the fighting really picked up.''
   Bahar Khareb, 15, said he and four friends rushed outside when
the soldiers came.
   ``We threw stones at a passing jeep,'' said Khareb, a slight
youngster who was wounded in the right shoulder and spoke
haltingly. ``The jeep stopped. An officer stood up and fired
directly at us from about 15 meters. He hit all five of us.''
   An army official said soldiers entering Beit Furik encountered
roadblocks and ``masses of villagers who attacked the force with
bottles, cement blocks and stones.''
   Five Arabs were detained, the army reported. Masmoud said he saw
soldiers taking 20 villagers away.
   Two army jeeps were parked at a roadblock outside Beit Furik
later Friday and soldiers barred reporters from the village.
   A doctor at Al Ittihad said five of the 18 people wounded by
gunfire were in serious condition. They said the victims a
22-year-old woman who was shot in the throat and paralyzed from the
chest down.
   Casualties were brought to the hospital throughout the morning.
About five hours after the battle, an 18-year-old arrived in the
emergency room with a bullet wound in the right leg.
   The young man, his face contorted with pain, said he walked
miles on back roads to avoid soldiers.
   Rabin said Thursday that the emphasis in the rebellion has
shifted from mass demonstrations to commercial strikes, civil
disobedience and individual acts of firebombing and stoning.
   ``The firebombs are the most disturbing problem,'' Maj. Gen.
Amram Mitzna, army commander in the West Bank, told Israel radio.
``We shall do everything possible to stop this phenomenon.''
   Mahmoud Shalabiye of Jericho in the West Bank said soldiers
knocked on his door at midnight Thursday and told him to remove his
belongings so they could seal the house.
   ``I have eight children at home and now they want to throw me to
the street ... because my son made a firebomb,'' he said on the
radio. ``I don't know what he does. He is 18 years old.''
   Jewish settlers said the army should be tougher. ``We are asking
to deport people who throw firebombs,'' Uri Ariel, head of the West
Bank settlement council, told the radio.
   Israel has deported 21 Arabs during the rebellion, most on
charges of inciting anti-Israeli violence.

<TEXT>
   A woman convicted in the nation's first
death-by-product tampering trial was sentenced to 90 years in
prison today for killing her husband and a stranger with Excedrin
capsules laced with cyanide.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer recommended that Stella
Nickell not be eligible for parole for a minimum of 30 years,
saying, ``The jury has found the defendant guilty of appalling
crimes.''
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, sat at the defense table
with her hands tightly clasped in her lap, her fingers intertwined
and her thumbs fidgeting. She appeared to pale when the sentence
was read.
   ``It must be said that these are crimes of exceptional
callousness and cruelty,'' Dwyer said, taking note of the fact that
the poisoned capsules had been left on store shelves and could have
easily fallen into the hands of innocent victims.
   Mrs. Nickell received 90-year terms each for two counts of
producting tampering that resulted in the deaths of her husband,
Bruce Nickell, and Susan Katherine Snow of Auburn. She faced
possible life terms on those two counts.
   Additionally she was sentenced to three 10-year terms for lacing
with cyanide Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules found in the Nickell
home and on the shelves of area stores.
   All terms were to run concurrently.
   Prosecutors had requested a sentence of 230 years, with a
minimum of 67 years served before she would be eligible for parole,
saying entire families could have died because of the tampering.
   ``It is unnerving to think just how many people stood to die
because of this woman's greed,'' said U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida,
who prosecuted the case.
   ``It was a tough case,'' said Mrs. Nickell's attorney, Thomas
Hillier, who told Dwyer during the hearing that he was working on
an appeal of her conviction. ``We expected a tough sentence. We
were prepared for it. We were prepared for worse.
   On Thursday, Dwyer rejected Mrs. Nickell's try to win a new
trial, saying she her guilt was determined by ``an attentive,
thorough and impartial jury.''
   Hillier had sought a new trial on grounds that juror Laurel
Holliday didn't mention during jury selection that three months
before the trial, she had accepted $500 in an out-of-court
settlement of her own product-contamination lawsuit against a
cracker manufacturer.
   Prosecutors argued there was no evidence Ms. Holliday was
biased, and, in fact, she was the only juror arguing for acquittal
during deliberations. She later changed her vote to guilty.
   In a 28-page ruling, Dwyer said there was no evidence Ms.
Holliday answered jury selection questions dishonestly.
   Even if all the facts known after the trial had been brought out
during jury selection, Dwyer said, there would not have been
grounds to excuse Ms. Holliday for cause.
   Mrs. Nickell was convicted May 9 of five counts of product
tampering, including two that resulted in the June 1986 deaths of
her husband and Ms. Snow.
   She was the first person in the United States brought to trial
under a federal law concerning death by product tampering.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng has said he would wait until
after sentencing to decide whether to file state murder charges.
   Prosecutors alleged Mrs. Nickell killed her husband because she
was tired of him and wanted to collect $176,000 in life insurance.
They said Mrs. Snow, who had no connection with the couple, was an
innocent victim of a plot to make Nickell's death appear to be the
work of a random killer.
   In addition to the tamperings that caused the deaths, Mrs.
Nickell was convicted of one count of putting cyanide in a second
bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin found in her home and two counts
of putting the poison in two other bottles found on store shelves
in Auburn and Kent.
   Federal prosecutors had asked Dwyer in their sentencing
memorandum to give Mrs. Nickell 100 years on each of the death
counts and the maximum 10 years on the three other counts, with the
terms to run consecutively.
   Mrs. Nickell, they wrote, ``willingly risked the lives of
countless other human beings'' to conceal her identity as her
husband's killer, ``an unconscionable, unforgiveable act against
humanity which not only justifies but compels the most serious
punishment available to this court.''
   The deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and caused
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers to recall its non-prescription
capsule medicines.
   Seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from cyanide-laced
Extra-Strength Tylenol, but those deaths remain unsolved.

members of related professions who have worked in South Africa
since 1981. A person can be taken off by promising in writing not
to perform there while the government practices the apartheid
policy of race segregation.
   The sixth annual list will be published next month. Frank
Sinatra, Tina Turner, Eartha Kitt and others were removed earlier
this year.
   Sotirios G. Mousouris, assistant secretary-general of the U.N.
Center Against Apartheid, said Friday the letter from Cher
responded to one he wrote to the actress.
   In an interview, he said he congratulated her on the Academy
Award she won for her performance in ``Moonstruck.''
   After telling Cher ``her career had been marked by sensitivity
and talent and her roles in `Silkwood,' `Mask' and `Suspect' show
her concern about injustice and oppression,'' he expressed surprise
that her name was on the list.
   Mousouris said he suggested that she might be unaware of it,
since the listing dated from a performance in August 1981.
   In a letter dated May 25, Cher wrote: ``This is to state that I
shall not be performing in South Africa as long as apartheid lasts
in that country.''
   The list's purpose is to persuade performers to join the boycott
and inform countries, groups and individuals about those who work
in South Africa.
   ``Most artists are sensitive to the issue of racial justice and
would want to be removed,'' Mousouris said, adding that Linda
Ronstadt, Goldie Hawn and Telly Savalas were among those to whom he
would write letters similar to the one he sent Cher.
   Fighting apartheid has been a major cause in the U.N. General
Assembly and Security Council, which have condemned the race laws
that preserve power for South Africa's 5 million whites and deny a
voice in national affairs to the 26 million blacks.
   On Sept. 2-4, the U.N. Special Committee Against Apartheid will
sponsor a meeting in Athens at which prominent artists, performers,
theater and movie directors and writers will discuss the cultural
boycott.
   Among about 30 people expected to attend are Harry Belafonte,
Jules Dassin, Yves Montand and Joseph Papp.

   The drought in Michigan is leaving
marijuana growers dry but not high.
   The state is entering the prime growing season for the illegal
but profitable weed and the thirsty plants need a lot of water,
said State Police Lt. Roy Vernier.
   ``They're either going to have to irrigate or their crop will be
very low,'' said Vernier, director of a program called Help
Eliminate Marijuana Planting. ``They won't have the harvest if the
drought continues.''
   Last year, police seized 82,000 plants through anonymous tips to
the HEMP program. Vernier said 90 people were arrested and 20
weapons were confiscated.

   His favorite color is green and he likes
basketball, but Larry Joe Bird the monkey is a pet, not an NBA
player.
   The guenon, a long-tailed monkey native to Africa, is named for
Larry Bird, a forward with the Boston Celtics and a native of
nearby French Lick.
   Linda Tuell said her husband, Brad, came up with the name.
   ``They were good friends in high school, both playing ball at
the same time,'' she said. ``Larry played for Springs Valley and
Brad played at Paoli.''
   Good behavior isn't the 2-year-old monkey's strong suit. Even
when tethered to a leash he manages to jump on furniture, whack
visitors on the face and steal things from their hands.
   Larry Joe stays in a cage in his own bedroom, which is decorated
with Celtics memorabilia, while Mrs. Tuell works at her family's
restaurant.
   ``He's such a character, we really have a lot of fun with him,''
she said.

   Minnesota may be known as the Gopher State
but this small township celebrates a bounty hunt to get rid of the
pesky rodents.
   Township officials collected more than 1,300 pairs of gopher
feet Thursday and doled out $1,377 to kick off the 114th annual
Viola Gopher Count.
   The township pays $1 each for a pair of feet from a pocket
gopher, and 25 cents for two pairs from striped gophers.
   Townspeople say it's worth it.
   ``Pockets are a problem in a hayfield,'' said township board
member Richard Brennan. ``They build mounds that high,'' he said,
raising his hands 8 inches off the table, ``and it's rough. You
can't mow it, and it's tough on the machines.''
   Hunters of all ages carried their bounty to the township
Thursday in freezer bags, socks, cigar boxes and buckets. One had
his nailed to a board in pairs for easy counting.
   This year's champion bounty hunter was Lyle Splittstoesser, 71.
He turned in 374 sets of feet worth $335.75. But because
Splittstoesser always turns in several hundred sets, he is
considered a ``professional'' and doesn't qualify for the
championship prize of $10.
   The township, near Rochester in the southeastern corner of the
state, has celebrated the hunt ever since a group of residents
gathered for a lemonade picnic in a pasture in 1874 and agreed to a
competition to see who could collect the most gopher tails by the
next year.

   Prosecutors indicted an alleged terrorist of the
Japanese Red Army on Friday in the hijacking of a Japanese jetliner
to North Korea 18 years ago, an official said.
   Yashuhiro Shibata was indicted by the Tokyo District
Prosecutor's office, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He said a convicted hijacker not charged with murder
faces a maximum term of life in prison.
   Shibata was arrested in Tokyo on May 6 with a false passport.
Police believe he returned to Japan in April 1985 from North Korea.
   Shibata, then 16 years old, was one of nine alleged Red Army
members who hijacked a Japan Air Lines Boeing 727 to the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang in 1970. The hijackers released all 138
aboard in exchange for a Japanese vice transport minister.
   The official would not discuss whether Shibata or members of the
group were planning terrorist action before or during the Olympic
Games scheduled for Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul, South Korea.
   Shibata's arrest and the recent arrests of several other
self-confessed or alleged members of Japan's Red Army have raised
concerns the radical leftist terrorist group may be planning
attacks at the Olympics.
   Seiroku Kajiyama, chairman of the National Public Safety
Commission, said Wednesday that the Red Army, which had been
dormant, is ``stepping up their activities and it is quite natural
that we think they have Seoul as a target.''

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says his acquittal
on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan shows ``justice
can occur in Arizona'' when the politicians who removed him from
office are not involved.
   A state jury on Thursday cleared Mecham and his brother,
Willard, on all counts.
   ``Justice in the political arena will take a little longer,''
Mecham said today. He pledged to push for ``a measurable effect''
in elections for the state Legislature this fall, and also to press
for a new state attorney general.
   ``We don't have any vindictive feelings,'' Mecham said at the
outset of a news conference, adding that ``I see much need for true
reforms'' in the judiciary in Arizona, including barring selective
prosecution so justice is even-handed.
   As for himself, he said, ``today is not the day to discuss my
political future.'' He said his legal bills so far total about
$500,000, that donations total about half of that amount, and that
he was reactivating the Mecham Legal Defense Fund.
   The first-term Republican became the first U.S. governor to be
impeached and removed from office in 59 years on April 4 when the
Arizona Senate convicted him on two unrelated impeachment counts.
   The House impeached him in connection with the $350,000 loan to
his 1986 campaign, but the Senate decided not to hear that charge
for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial.
   Willard Mecham, also at the news conference today, said: ``There
were two dark days in the history of Arizona in 1988. The first was
the day we were indicted, and the second was the day Evan was
impeached.''
   Being indicted unjustly was ``the most evil experience I have
ever had in my life,'' he added.
   ``Justice can occur in Arizona when you get to the people and
outside the politicians,'' Mecham, 64, told reporters outside the
Maricopa County courthouse Thursday. ``We're happy, we're happy.
You're always apprehensive but not really surprised.''
   Assistant Attorney General Barnett Lotstein, one of two
prosecutors in the case, said he had ``no quarrel with the
decision.''
   ``We believe we presented a responsible case that had to be
presented. We obviously felt we had a good case. A lot of the
people in this community feel that he has suffered enough, and
perhaps that was a factor,'' Lotstein said outside the courtroom.
   As the verdict was read, Mecham smiled broadly and embraced his
attorney, Michael Scott, hugged his wife, Florence, then walked
over to the jurors and shook their hands.
   ``Winning this is better news than winning the election, because
if he lost the election he wouldn't have gone to jail,'' Mrs.
Mecham said later Thursday.
   ``It's been terrible listening to people call your husband a
liar,'' she said. ``He has never told a lie a day in his life, but
sometimes it seems you can't convince some people of that.''
   As Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan declared the trial over,
Mecham's supporters cheered. Scott asked Ryan whether Mecham could
make a statement, but the judge refused, saying, ``This is a court
of law, Mr. Scott.''
   Mecham acknowledged he did not itemize the loan from developer
and lawyer Barry Wolfson on personal or campaign financial
statements required by the state. The defense called the failure an
innocent mistake, partly due to Willard Mecham's inexperience as a
bookkeeper.
   However, the prosecution insisted that Mecham badly needed the
loan to keep his campaign afloat, then hid it to avoid spoiling his
theme of being ``beholden to no one.''
   The jury deliberated 6{ hours Wednesday and Thursday after
hearing seven days of testimony and two days of closing arguments.
   Mecham could have been sentenced to 22 years in prison if
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment
and filing false documents. His 67-year-old brother, who was his
1986 campaign treasurer, faced a maximum 9{ years on three similar
counts.
   Gov. Rose Mofford, the Democratic secretary of state who took
over after Mecham's removal, said in a statement that she hoped her
predecessor ``and his entire family can resume their lives as
private citizens.''
   ``The end of this trial signals a hastening of a healing process
which has begun and that the citizens of this great state so richly
deserve,'' she said.
   State Attorney General Bob Corbin, whose office prosecuted the
case, said he had offered to let Mecham plead guilty to a
misdemeanor before the trial began, but Mecham rejected the offer.
   Corbin said he felt the case had been proven ``well beyond'' a
reasonable doubt.
   Lotstein said the main issue was whether the Mechams intended to
break the law when they filed the disclosure forms.
   ``The word `knowingly' is what swayed most of us,'' said juror
Anthony Christie of Phoenix. ``We did not think he knew he was
doing anything wrong. ... Those were innocent mistakes.''
   Mecham, a former auto dealer, ran for governor four times
unsuccessfully before winning a three-way race in November 1986.
   He sparked controversy just one week after taking office in
January 1987 when he canceled a Martin Luther King holiday for
state workers, saying it was created illegally.
   Mecham later made remarks that angered blacks, women, Jews,
homosexuals and Japanese-Americans. He was also accused of making a
series of substandard appointments to top state positions.

<HEAD>Pope Says He Will Soon Publish Document On Role Of Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Friday he will soon
publish a major document on the role of women in the Roman Catholic
Church and in society.
   The Vatican said the document will be published before the Aug.
15 conclusion of the church's Marian Year, which the pontiff
proclaimed to honor Mary, the mother of Jesus.
   ``I intend to soon publish a document on the dignity and the
vocation of the woman, as it already was announced in the papal
encyclical `Redemptoris Mater,''' the pope told the Council of the
Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops.
   ``In such a way, I intend to respond to the desire that the
Synod fathers have expressed in this regard and, at the same time,
insert reflections on the role of the woman in the context of the
Marian Year,'' he added.
   ``Redemptoris Mater,'' which in Latin means Mother of the
Redeemer, was John Paul's sixth encyclical, the most authoritative
form of a papal letter. At the time, Vatican circles interpreted
remarks in the document to be a restatement of the church's
opposition to women in the priesthood.
   In the March 1987 encyclical, John Paul wrote that the figure of
Mary ``sheds light on womanhood as such by the very fact that God,
in the sublime event of the incarnation of his son, entrusted
himself to the ministry, the free and active ministry of a woman.''
   ``It can thus be said that women, by looking to Mary, find in
her the secret of living their femininity with dignity and of
achieving their own true advancement,'' he said.
   Women are not allowed to serve as priests or deacons, and the
church opposes artificial birth control, abortion and sex outside
of marriage.

   A parachuting instructor and aerial
acrobat who died while saving a student making her first jump was
honored Friday at the airport where he was killed.
   Walter ``Hawk'' Leno, 45, of Bolton, was an ultralight
enthusiast, stuntman and instructor who held records for his
airborne acrobatics. His dramatic rescue and death Saturday was
captured on videotape by the student's husband.
   ``Hawk did a lot for the sport (parachuting) in Vermont, said
Ray Beresford, Leno's jumping partner for the past five years.
   ``He exposed a lot of people to it who wouldn't have learned
about it otherwise. It's unfortunate he had to die this way. It's
just what he didn't want,'' Beresford told the friends and admirers
at Shelburne Airport, the base for most of Leno's flying and
jumping.
   Authorities have refused to release the name of the student,
whose parachute jump was a gift from her husband.
   The footage taken by the husband shows Leno and the woman
falling end over end as they left the plane at 4,000 feet, said
state police investigator Leo Blais.
   Blais, who reviewed the videotape with a U.S. Parachutists
Association official, said the student's primary chute became
caught between her legs. She and Leno tried to loosen it, and Leno
finally pulled her emergency chute at about 600 feet, he said.
   Leno, however, could not pull his chute at the same time because
the two might have become entangled and neither would have worked,
Blais said.
   ``But by the time he cleared her he was at just 200 feet and by
the time he pulled his chute open he had hit,'' he said.
   It was just 23 seconds from the time Leno and his student jumped
until he hit the ground. He was traveling 130 mph at impact, Blais
said.
   He said the student suffered injury to her tailbone.
   ``It's very clear from the video that he gave up his life to
save hers,'' said Blais.
   Leno launched his own business, Barnstormers Aviation, last
year. He assembled and sold ultralight planes and did jumps for
parties, county fairs and weddings.

   The mother and sisters of Irish hostage
Brian Keenan appealed in a Beirut newspaper Friday to the
kidnappers to declare their demands for his release.
   ``More than two years have lapsed since the disappearance of our
son and brother in Beirut,'' said the appeal, published in the
An-Nahar newspaper.
   The letter was signed by Maria Keenan, the hostage's mother, and
her two daughters, Brenda Geilham and Eliane Spinneys.
   ``Despite the fears we have suffered during this period, we
still hope that Brian will be freed and return to his family in
Ireland soon,'' they said.
   ``We have addressed previous appeals through the media in
Lebanon for information about the fate of Brian Keenan. But no one
has come forth with any information about him,'' they said. ``If
you are not prepared to free him, we ask you to declare what should
be done so that he regains his freedom.
   ``We are poor people, but are willing to do everything we can to
help Brian.''
   Keenan, 36, of Belfast, worked as an English-language teacher at
the American University of Beirut. He was kidnapped on April 11,
1986. No group has claimed reponsibility for his abduction.
   Seventeen other foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon. They are
nine Americans, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Indian
and two unidentified men.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   During his tenure as U.S. attorney, Leon Kellner
saw an indictment against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
drug charges against officials in Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia, the
Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, Suriname and Cuba.
   ``I had no inkling I would be at the eye of the hurricane, and I
still have trouble understanding it,'' Kellner said before his last
day in office, Friday. ``I'm not doing anything profound _ I just
take a case where the evidence leads.''
   Kellner spent three years as an assistant and three years as
chief prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida, among the
busiest federal districts in the nation.
   Kellner's office indicted leaders of the Colombia-based Medellin
Cartel, responsible for up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports.
And he successfully prosecuted scores of Miami police who ran a
drug-ripoff ring.
   Kellner, 42, who usually is very serious and low-key but flashes
an occasional ironic smile, is proud he aimed for the leaders of
drug rings, but says only drying up the demand can really stem
trafficking.
   ``When I became U.S. attorney, one of the things I wanted do was
go as high up in the narcotics trafficking business as I could,''
said Kellner. ``And I think that's what I did.''
   But not without personal danger.
   His most chilling moments came after the extradition of Medellin
Cartel leader Carlos Lehder Rivas, when SWAT teams and federal
agents responding to death threats were sent to guard him and his
family against possible reprisals from the violent drug ring. His
family fled their Coral Gables home and, for a time, had to be
escorted on routine errands.
   ``What is interesting about that episode is that ... the
government was prepared to do anything, no matter what the cost, to
ensure the safety'' of people working on the case, says Kellner,
whose Jewish parents fled Nazi Germany before World War II.
   He contrasts that with the violence the cartel has wreaked on
Colombia, where a justice minister, an attorney general and
hundreds of other law enforcement officials have been gunned down.
   That experience made him even more militant on winning
extradition rights from countries which have been traditional
havens for traffickers.
   ``The reason extradition is so important in my mind is that
there is a recognition that foreign countries ... do not enforce
their own laws because of the power of the cartel, the threats of
the cartel,'' he says.
   The Noriega indictment and the subequent political firestorm
over negotations to drop the charges forced Kellner to take a
strong public stand against politicizing law enforcement. But he is
understanding of the administration's problems.
   ``What that flap indicates is the extraordinary problems that we
have in dealing with narcotics in the international sphere,'' he
says. ``This is the most unique problem that law enforcement has
ever dealt with.''
   Kellner differs strongly with those who say legalization of
drugs could solve problems stemming from the drug trade.
   While drugs have been the focus of most of his attention, one of
the most professionally painful moments of his tenure came over
another high-profile investigation, into arms smuggling to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Critics accused him of buckling under to the Reagan
administration and stalling an investigation of a 1985 weapons
shipment to the Contras out of Fort Lauderdale. But Kellner notes
he has been cleared by every investigation into that case. And an
indictment in the case is expected later this month.
   Those criticisms, his wife's bout with thyroid cancer from which
she is recovering, the Noriega drama and his inability to stem drug
trafficking eventually took their toll on Kellner, however.
   After taking the summer off with his family, Kellner will return
to Washington to rejoin the firm he helped found, Anderson, Baker,
Kill & Olick. ``There comes a point when I get frustrated,'' says
Kellner. ``I did the job for six years ... sometimes you just have
to recharge your batteries.''

   Dutch salvage workers using a huge

   Operations were continuing to float the Dutch-flagged Anna
Broere and empty its cargo of highly inflammable and toxic arcylon
nitryl, said ministry spokesman Bruno Voskuyl.
   None of the chemical, which is used by the plastics industry,
had leaked so far, Voskuyl said.
   Workers of the Smit-Tak salvage company attached reinforced
steel cables around its hull and righted the wreck with the crane,
Voskuyl said.
   The ship, carrying 1,600 tons of the chemical agent, sank about
55 miles off the North Sea port after it and the Swedish-flagged
freighter Atlantic Compass collided.
   There were no injuries in the accident.

<TEXT>
   The daughter and two sons of a wealthy
Lebanese jeweler who were kidnapped three days ago by gunmen
demanding $3 million in ransom were freed Friday and returned home
safely.
   It was not known whether their father, Zuheir Ariss, paid the
ransom the kidnappers demanded in a telephone call.
   Interior Minister Abdullah Rassi said the kidnappers had not
been arrested but that the investigation was continuing.
   The children, who were snatched Tuesday from their
chauffeur-driven Mercedes in west Beirut, said they were not hurt
during their captivity.
   ``We had chicken for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the past
three days. I don't want to see chicken for the rest of my life,''
9-year-old Samer Ariss said at his home on west Beirut's Hamra
Street.
   Ramzi, 5, said he missed his parents and was very frightened
``because we were locked in a room filled with cockroaches and
ants.''
   ``They (the kidnappers) did not hurt us,'' said his sister,
Dana, 14.
   A police spokesman said mediators from the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, handed the children to Brig. Gen. Ali
Hammoud, the Syrian army's intelligence chief in Beirut, and
Lebanese police chief Col. Issam Abu Ziki at the Syrian army
command in Beirut on Friday morning.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said Hammoud and Ziki delivered the children to their
home about 40 minutes later.
   Ariss owns a plush jewelry shop and a money exchange company.
   In a statement broadcast by the Moslem Voice of the Nation
radio, Ariss expressed ``gratitude to all those who helped achieve
the release of my children.''
   ``We thank God because this ordeal was brought to an end. We
thank God for the safe return of our three children,'' he said.
   Ziki refused to say if the ransom demand was met or to elaborate
on how the children were freed from the kidnappers.
   In a separate development Friday, police said seven people were
wounded overnight in sporadic machine gun fire between followers of
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and members of
the Syrian-backed anti-Arafat faction called Fatah-Uprising.
   The new casualties brought the overall toll to 31 killed and 137
wounded in the latest round of fighting for control of Chatilla and
Bourj el-Barajneh camps.
   A police spokesman said two Libyan military observers entered
Chatilla on Friday to try to enforce a cease-fire and disengage the
combatants. Two other Libyans were to enter Bourj el-Barajneh later.
   Libya is an ally of both Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
Assad. Its leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, played a key role in
bringing Assad and Arafat to meet in a reconciliation effort in
April.
   Palestinian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Arafat had sent a letter to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
discussing ways of ending fighting in the camps between his
fighters and those of the Syrian-backed breakaway faction led by
Col. Saeed Moussa.
   Assad, a Soviet friend, and Arafat have been bitter enemies
since Syria backed the May 1983 uprising against Arafat.

<TEXT>
   A bill that some believe is the first step of
a $3 billion project to map the human genetic pattern passed the
Senate Friday by a vote of 88 to 1.
   The legislation, called the Biotechnology Competitiveness Act,
does not authorize the start of any laboratory research, but
experts in the biotechnology field said the bill creates a
framework that would enable the start of a major genetic project in
about two years.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., cast the single dissenting vote.
   The bill has four major provisions. These are:
   _Establish a 20-member national biotechnology policy board to
review federal research support efforts and to make recommendations
on biotechnology issues. The first report to the president and to
Congress is due by Jan. 31, 1990.
   _Establish an advisory panel on the human genome that will
develop a strategy needed for a project to map and sequence the
human genome, or genetic pattern. Experts say that a crash program
of research on the genome would take seven to 10 years and cost
about $3 billion.
   _Establish a $10 million biotechnology information center at the
National Library of Medicine.
   _And, finally, the bill would reauthorize a biomedical ethics
board that would analyze the reports of the biotechnology policy
board and the human genome advisory panel.
   Provisions in the bill are estimated to cost $10.4 million in
fiscal year 1989, which begins in October. The cost would rise to
$14.2 million in 1990, $15.4 million in 1991, and $13 million
annually for the following two yeasrs.
   Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology
Association, said the 88 to 1 vote ``shows the overwhelming support
of the United States for the biotechnology industry.''
   Godown said that establishing the boards and panels described in
the bill are essential for organizing the genome research, a
project that may involve hundreds of laboratories and thousands of
scientists.
   ``This clears the way for the money to be appropriated later,''
he said. Godown said it may be two years before the project is
organized, but that the organizational structure established by the
bill is the first step.
   Godown said that private industry and some federal laboratories
already are studying the human genome and this work will continue
while the committees conduct their studies.
   The human genome is the genetic pattern contained in the human
chromosones. The pattern, which is unique to each individual,
determines fundamental physical characteristics. Many diseases are
related to genetic patterns and scientists hope that by
understanding the genome that these diseases can be treated or
prevented.
   Godown said understanding the genome is fundamental to the
revolution occurring in biotechnology.
   ``Mapping the sequence of the human genome will determine the
degree of success we realize from the biotechnology revolution,''
he said. By understanding the genetic pattern, Godown said,
scientists will significantly advance an understanding of how the
human body works.
   The bill was drawn up after studies by scientists at the
National Research Council strongly supported a federally funded
effort to map and sequence the human genome.
   One major consideration supporting the genome research is
international competition.
   The Department of Commerce has estimated that the market for
biotechnology products _ which would include pharmaceuticals and
agricultural products _ will exceed $40 billion a year by 2000.
France, Germany and Japan already have national biotechnology
programs which includes human genome research.

   More than 1,600 rebels were freed from
Ugandan prisons on Friday on the orders of President Yoweri
Museveni, the government said.
   The release is expected to improve Museveni's efforts to
organize peace talks with several rebel armies fighting his
government in the north and east of Uganda, Western analysts told
The Associated Press.
   The Internal Affairs Ministry said the guerrillas were freed
following a directive by Museveni earlier this week that 1,671
prisoners of war be freed.
   Most of the prisoners were fighting for the Uganda People's
Democratic Movement, a northern-based guerrilla force. They were
held without charge after being captured in clashes with government
troops.
   Museveni evidently ordered their release as a concession to
guerrilla leaders with whom government envoys have made contact in
a bid for peace in Uganda. The country has been convulsed by civil
conflicts almost constantly since its independence from Britain on
Oct. 9, 1962.
   Museveni seized power in January 1986, ending a five-year war
against civilian president Milton Obote and the military junta that
ousted Obote in July 1985. Museveni formed a government of national
unity, inviting four other rival parties to join his Cabinet.
   In September and October 1986, soldiers arrested several men on
treason charges of plotting a coup. Courts have released most of
the men for lack of evidence.
   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,
including former military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted guerrilla
operations against Museveni's government since August 1986.
   Amin lives in exile in Saudi Arabia and Obote in Britain.

   Drought that is curling corn leaves and
darkening wheat fields across the nation's heartland calls for a
blueprint for aiding farmers and guarding against stepped up food
prices, lawmakers said Friday.
   ``We have to have a battle plan before too long,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said as a congressional task force met with
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng to discuss possible means of
responding to the drought.
   The bipartisan House-Senate task force was formed this week to
monitor the drought and its effect on crops and to prepare
recommendations for congressional action if that should prove
necessary.
   Lyng has been saying lawmakers should wait to learn more about
the full extent of the damage before they begin to formulate aid
legislation.
   USDA officials reiterated that much of the wheat crop in Montana
and the Dakotas already is severely damaged, but an inch or so of
rain once a week for the rest of the growing season could save the
Midwest's corn and soybean crops.
   ``We need teamwork, Repoublican and Democrat, House and Senate
and the administration to make sure that the federal government
responds to the catastrophe that many American farmers today
face,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la
Garza, D-Texas, said.
   He said the goals of the task force should be to assess the
impact on trade and food prices and to formulate recommendations
for farm aid.
   De la Garza applauded Lyng for a decision Thursday to loosen
USDA rules to allow farmers to cut hay on Conservation Reserve
Program acreage. He had earlier resisted such a step, saying
growers already had been paid by the government to keep the highly
erodible lands out of production for a decade.
   De la Garza called Lyng's decision a ``first step.'' A number of
lawmakers have been calling for livestock grazing on the acreage.
   A Senate Agriculture Committee contingent planned to visit wheat
country over the weekend for first-hand inspections of drought
damage.
   Pryor said the task force should not overlook the health effect
``that the long-protracted heat wave has on the rural elderly.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said the task force should look into
the possibility of cooperation between federal and local
governments as well as the private sector on providing irrigation
to farmers who are without it.
   Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., called on
Lyng to look into some way of utilizing the Federal Crop Insurance
Program to aid farmers caught in a complex financial bind by the
drought.
   Because the drought threatens to make agricultural commodities
scarce, it already is driving up their prices. But higher prices,
in turn, are likely to shrink federal income-support payments that
growers receive.
   The payments are the difference between market prices and
higher, target prices set by Congress and adjusted by the secretary
of agriculture. As the difference narrows, the farmer's payment
shrinks. Meanwhile, the drought may leave the grower without a crop
to sell at the higher market levels.
   The problem is even worse for many farmers who have received
part of their income-support payments in advance and now are faced
with the prospect of having to repay part of them.
   Harkin said it might be possible to reopen the sign-up period
for obtaining federal crop insurance.
   Officials said it would be worthwhile to explore ways that the
crop insurance system might be useful. But they added that there
could be problems.
   ``If we move into some kind of a relief package, we need to
recognize those who did have the willingness to buy crop
insurance,'' Lyng said. ``But at the same time we cannot ignore
those who did not.''

   Health experts are trying to determine why a
firefighter candidate died and six others became ill after
completing recent grueling physical endurance tests, officials said
Friday.
   ``We have no idea at this point what caused it. That's why we
have medical people and others looking into it. They're looking at
everything,'' said Fire Department personnel spokeswoman Magda
Gandasegui.
   As a result of the incidents, the department has suspended
further tests of prospective firefighters. ``We're going on a
day-to-day basis,'' Ms. Gandasegui said. ``We don't know when we'll
resume.''
   She said the firefighter candidates became ill after tests
conducted on different occasions this month.
   The physican endurance test ``a very demanding test,'' Ms.
Gandasegui said. ``It simulates the job of a firefighter, so we
expect our candidates are physically fit.''
   During the test, would-be firefighters wear 40 pounds of gear
while scaling walls, carring a 145-pound dummy, breaking down a
door and dragging 57 pounds of hose.
   She said the seven candidates were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Medical Center at different times. One candidate died June 11
shortly after arriving at the hospital.
   Autopsy results were inconclusive, and the cause of death was
not ascertained pending the results of further tests, said Ellen
Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.
   The others were not seriously ill; two remained hospitalized in
good condition, said hospital spokeswoman Judy Murphy. She said the
patients were treated for mild-to-moderate kidney disease, caused
by physical exertion. She said the effects are reversible.
   Experts from the city Health Department and fire officials were
examining the room where the test was conducted to see if there was
any connection.
   Ms. Gandasegui said more than 5,000 candidates have completed
the test that was to run May 31 through July.

   Fourth-generation farmer Robert
Seidenstricker spent the spring pouring millions of gallons of well
water over his parched fields and praying for rain.
   But he doesn't stop at prayers.
   Seidenstricker is one of new breed of farmer, who, armed with an
agribusiness degree, uses a computer to deal with the drought
plaguing the nation's farmlands.
   How will he know when _ or whether _ to plant his soybeans?
   ``We've got the numbers on Lotus 1-2-3,'' Seidenstricker said
Friday, referring to the popular IBM personal computer software.
``You don't wake up some day and say, `Hell, it's too late.' No,
no, no. I update the figures daily.
   ``I can figure the amount of bushels we'll yield on each acre of
beans planted and put those numbers against the pre-sold contracts'
liquidated damages and determine whether it will be profitable to
plant,'' he said. ``We are not flying by the seat of our pants.
   ``This is a business. This is a science. We have an accountant
and we have our lawyer. We're on our second computer system and
we're not a large farmer by any means. We don't stand out in any
shape, form or fashion. A lot of farms are very intensely managed.
It's not just the production end of it any more.''
   Seidenstricker, 30, a graduate of Arkansas State University,
runs a 1,300-acre farm with his parents in Tollville, about 45
miles east of Little Rock, planted mostly in rice, sorghum and,
usually, soybeans.
   But the ground hasn't been moist enough to get the beans planted
this year, prompting the unprecedented pre-planting irrigation.
   Last month was the state's driest since 1970 and the
fifth-driest ever recorded, according to the National Weather
Service, aggravating what were already drought conditions.
   Seidenstricker estimates rainfall is a foot below normal in
Prairie County, so even irrigation may not be enough. He said he
needs a steady 2-inch rain to get his 400 acres of soybeans
planted. If the family cannot plant before the Fourth of July, the
season may be lost.
   With a usual yield of 40 bushels of soybeans per acre,
Seidenstricker estimated that he'll lose two bushels an acre for
each day the beans don't get planted, starting from Thursday.
   And because he and other farmers have pre-sold some of their
soybeans, he'll have to pay the contract price in damages to the
buyers if he can't provide the beans.
   ``We're trying things that have never been tried before'' to
cope with the drought, Seidenstricker said. ``Everyone is.''
   A farm outbuilding houses Seidenstricker's office, his desk
piled high with crop reports, market forecasts and computer
printouts. He sat in the office in jeans, a golf shirt and boots
before taking a reporter on a tour of his arid fields.
   Seidenstricker said the drought is the worst since he began
farming in 1979.
   Said his father, Fred Seidenstricker, a more traditional farmer
who leaves the computer work to his son: ``I have been through the
'30s and I have been through 1980, and this is the worst that I
have seen.''
   The younger Seidenstricker serves on a local bank board, but he
declined to say whether he thought the drought would put some
farmers out of business.
   He's worried about the potential long-term effect of the dry
season, noting that soybean prices have soared to $9.30 a bushel
for November delivery.
   ``That's the highest since I can remember,'' Seidenstricker
said. ``You'd like to have some to sell at this price. But looking
at the longer term, consider that Brazil and Argentina, our major
competitors in soybeans, will look at that price and they'll expand
their acreage. They have large land mass, good soil, cheap labor.
   ``They can grow cheaper than we can,'' he said. ``A high price
will encourage them.''

<HEAD>Senate Authorizes $2 Billion for National Science Foundation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday approved a bill
authorizing $2 billion for the National Science Foundation in the
1989 fiscal year.
   The bill, passed 88-1, would direct the foundation to establish
programs to stimulate research at colleges and universities, and in
states that historically receive little federal research funding.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., cast the only dissenting vote.
   The bill increases the federally funded research into
superconductivity by 30 percent, adding $5 million to the $16.5
million already planned by the Reagan administration.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the commercial opportunities
in superconductivity _ the study of chemistry that allows
electricity to flow without resistence _ ``are mindboggling for
transportation, computers, medicine and energy.''
   ``I want us to lead in this field, to gain a competitive
advantage over other nations, and I believe we can if we provide
the resources to our best scientists so that they cand do the
research they are eager and able to do,'' Bentsen said.
   The bill authorizes $2.05 billion for the NSF in fiscal 1989,
which begins Oct. 1. It boosts the authorization to $2.15 in 1990;
$2.47 billion in 1991; $2.83 billion in 1992, and $3.24 billion in
1993.
   Several new programs benefiting universities and certain states
were established in the bill.
   The provisions call for the NSF to help colleges renovate
obsolete laboratories, start a program to encourage undergraduate
research, and to assist both colleges and states that have received
relatively few of the federal research dollars in the past.
   Also included in the bill is a provision directing the National
Academy of Sciences for earthquake engineering research efforts.

   The Cuban government is broadcasting at night
on two AM radio frequencies used by U.S. stations, but the Federal
Communications Commission said Friday it has received no complaints
about interference.
   In the broadcasts, which began Thursday night and were monitored
by the FCC, the Cubans said they would continue broadcasting
through Sunday night on the frequencies as part of a music festival
on the Caribbean island.
   The FCC said the Cubans did the same thing a year ago as part of
the same music festival, but the National Association of
Broadcasters said the transmissions were ``clearly a show of
force'' in response to a Senate proposal to beam American
television programs to Cuba.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved
spending $7.5 million to start a U.S. government TV service to Cuba
to supplement Radio Marti, which has been broadcasting to the
communist-run nation for three years.
   When Radio Marti was being debated on Capitol Hill in 1983,
Cuban leader Fidel Castro fired up powerful transmitters and beamed
music and political programs to the United States, interfering with
broadcasts by U.S. radio stations as far away as Salt Lake City,
Utah.
   The NAB has raised concerns about TV Marti, citing the
possibility of retaliatory jamming by Cuba of American AM stations
and interference to southern Florida TV stations from the TV Marti
signal itself.
   The FCC said the Cubans broadcast Thursday from about 7 p.m. or
8 p.m. to 12:16 a.m. at 150 kilowatts of power on the 1040 and 1160
kilohertz frequencies. The Cubans broadcast at that power during
the day, but ordinarily they lower their power at night so as not
to interfere with two U.S. stations that use those frequencies,
said FCC spokeswoman Rosemary Kimball.
   She said the two stations whose signals might have been affected
by the broadcasts were WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, which uses the 1040
frequency, and KSL in Salt Lake City, which broadcasts on 1160.
   John Dehnel, chief engineer at KSL, said the station received no
complaints of interference from listeners Thursday night, ``but it
usually takes two or three nights for people to realize it's not
something wrong with their radio, that it's interference.''
   Kimball said the Cuban broadcasts Thursday night were aimed at
tourists at the Cuban beaches and that no political programming was
heard.

   It was a super birthday party.
   But what else would you expect? The guest of honor was Superman
himself, joined by Wonder Woman, Luke Skywalker, and Rocky and
Bullwinkle.
   The four-day International Superman Exposition is expected to
draw up to 30,000 visitors before it ends Sunday.
   While the Man of Steel arrived on Earth from Krypton, his
birthplace is actually Cleveland. Superman was created by Cleveland
high school students Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and the first
Superman comic book appeared in June 1938.
   Superhero devotees have come to browse through comic books,
watch science fiction movies, and shop for memorabilia, including
rare Superman prints, said Tim Gorman of Neverending Battle Inc., a
non-profit organization founded to honor Siegel and Shuster and
sponsoring the symposium.
   On Thursday, Gorman unveiled a 2-foot-high shining steel model
of Superman in flight, right fist thrust high in a familiar pose.
The organization plans to raise enough money to build a larger
statue and a museum in Cleveland.

   A midwife-paramedic rushed in ``like the

grandchild, unexpectedly born at home in breech position, said the
frightened father.
   Ed Chiles said there wasn't time to rush wife Anne to the
hospital Thursday, so he called help to their Holmes Beach home.
   But Kristin Anne was born feet first, and paramedics couldn't
get her head out and had to call for more help. Paramedic Doreen
Virginiak, one of only three registered midwives in the area,
showed up.
   ``It was like the cavalry came when she got here,'' Ed Chiles

   Within 10 minutes, the baby was delivered.
   ``She was lethargic and wasn't breathing,'' said Ms. Virginiak,
who massaged the baby into breathing.
   ``I was pretty frightened,'' the new father said hours later.
``Now it looks like we're going to have a nice baby girl.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., announced the birth during a Senate
Appropriations Committee meeting in Washington.
   ``He probably got the strongest applause that he's gotten since
he came to the Senate,'' said Jack Pridgen, an aide to the senior

   Award-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr.
says starring roles are nice, but they're not everything.
   ``Sometimes actors confine themselves to just the lead role,''
he said. ``I promised myself never to get an egotistical attitude
on the parts I choose, and instead I look at the role, whether it

<HEAD>All-Male Club To Vote Again On Admitting Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The all-male Cosmos Club, whose members once
included Supreme Court Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis D.
Brandeis, is about to vote for the third time in its 110-year
history on admitting women. But for the first time, the leadership
of the club has unanimously endorsed the idea.
   Members of the club are scheduled to vote Saturday afternoon,
and although no one will say for certain how the vote will come
out, club President Tedson J. Meyers said the question of whether
to admit women has become the main topic of conversation among
members.
   Meyers, a lawyer and former member of the City Council in
Washington, said that the club currently has about 3,000 to 3,100
members, down several hundred in the past few years. But Meyers
denied that the vote on admitting women has anything to do with the
decline in membership. ``Membership seems to go up and down,'' he
said.
   Meyers also denied that the vote Saturday is a direct result of
a ruling last fall by the Washington Human Rights Office that
``there is probable cause to believe'' that the club's men-only
policy violates the city's anti-discrimination law. The office is
ready to order public hearings on the case, which could result in
the loss of all city licenses and permits, if the all-male policy
stays in place.
   ``It's a matter the club would have taken up in any event,''
Meyers said, although he acknowledged that the Human Rights
Office's action did act as a catalyst.
   And while Meyers confirmed that a Committee of Concerned
Members, formed in 1980 to advocate the admission of
``distinguished women,'' still exists, he said that it was not the
committee that had put forth the latest proposal to admit women.
   ``This is the first time the officers and the board of directors
brought the proposal forward,'' Meyers said. ``They unanimously
endorsed it. They always opposed the idea before.''
   The club, located in a mansion on the city's so-called Embassy
Row, first voted on whether to admit women in 1973, after 61
members signed a petition proposing that women be allowed to join.
The proposal was killed by a 274-203 vote.
   Again, in 1974, 50 members called for a vote on admitting women.
The vote in this round was 407-204 against the proposal.
   A two-thirds majority is needed to change the club's bylaws,
Meyers said.
   He pointed out that women can, and do, use the club. Female
guests of members, as well as wives and widows of members and
former members, are allowed to dine in the downstairs dining rooms.
But women are not allowed in the second-floor members dining room,
except on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends.
   Members of the club have included Cabinet members, Pulitzer
Prize and Nobel Peace Prize winners. Supreme Court Justice Harry A.
Blackmun was a member for 18 years, but resigned last winter.
   The club was founded by geologist John Wesley Powell in 1878 and
originally met in Powell's living room. It now charges a $900
initiation fee and $900 in annual dues.

<HEAD>Senate Begins Debate On Corporate Takeover Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate began considering legislation
Friday that would make it tougher for corporate raiders to succeed
in hostile takeovers and increase criminal penalties for people
convicted of insider trading.
   Several days of debate loom over the bill, pitting lawmakers who
argue that takeovers cost jobs and cut productivity against others
who insist that shareholders need the power to readily remove
inefficient managers.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee and sponsor of the bill, described corporate raiders as
``agents of greed'' and said, ``Americans are rightly fed up with
this takeover game.''
   Proxmire and his supporters argue that corporate takeovers have
become a primary goal of American business activity, causing
executives to spend much of their time on mergers and acquisitions
instead of enhancing their companies' competitiveness.
   In addition, they say, successful bidders often sink so deeply
into debt that to repay their lenders, they must sell productive
parts of the companies they have acquired, often costing jobs.
   But opponents say co-called hostile takeovers actually consist
of willing sellers surrendering their stock to willing buyers.
Instead, they say, it is abuses by managers who fear being fired by
new owners that must be controlled.
   ``Hostile acquisition of companies is a traditional technique
used to ... change corporate policy or displace incompetent
management,'' said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, ranking Republican on
the banking panel.
   The legislation would give investors buying 5 percent of a
company's stock five days to report the transaction to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and bar them from acquiring
more shares until the report is filed.
   Currently, there is a 10-day reporting deadline, and purchases
can continue before the report is filed, permitting takeovers to
proceed before the activity is publicly known.
   Share buyers would be required to report whether their goal is
to make an investment or acquire the entire company.
   Share holders would be given 35 business days _ nearly doubling
the current 20 days _ to consider public tender offers, in which a
buyer offers to buy stock at a specified price. Buyers who acquire
25 percent of a company would be required to make future purchases
through tender offers.
   In addition, the SEC would be given the power to sue investors
who disobey disclosure requirements for up to 50 percent of the
value of the stocks they acquired. Currently, violators are often
ordered simply to stop their violations or correct the inaccurate
information they have provided.
   Maximum penalties for insider trading would be increased from
five years to 10 years in jail, and $100,000 to $1 million.
   Some lawmakers say they believe the legislation puts roadblocks
in front of raiders without halting abuses by corporate management.
   One amendment will be offered to bar the issuance of non-voting
shares of stock, which some companies use to limit the number of
people who control corporations.
   Others will be considered that are designed to limit golden
parachutes, or expensive severance benefits for executives; poison
pills, or moves by companies aimed at discouraging raiders, such as
increasing debt; and greenmail, or payments by target companies of
high prices for stocks to raiders who agree to halt their takeover
efforts.

<HEAD>GOP Charges Against Citizen Action Ridiculous, Group Spokesman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegations by the National Republican
Senatorial Committee that a Chicago-based group has made illegal
campaign contributions is ``a ridiculous charge'' designed to
stifle concerns of average citizens, a spokesman said Friday.
   Robert Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, said the GOP
committee's recent charges against the 1.75 million-member group
were misleading and false.
   The committee said Thursday that Citizen Action and its
affiliates in 24 states have gone beyond the legal bounds of
pushing issues solely among members. Instead, the committee said,
they used donations to make a pitch for political candidates to
members and the general public.
   Brandon said the committee's allegations contained ``a great
deal of misstatement, falsehood and inaccuracy about the nature of
our organization.''
   Committee members, Brandon said, ``have decided to embrace this
ridiculous charge that's really designed to stifle the legitimate
concerns of average citizens.'' He added that many members of
Citizen Action were in fact Republicans.
   The GOP committee has said it will ask the Internal Revenue
Service and the Federal Election Commission to investigate its
charges against Citizen Action.

   Parched farmland soaked up moderate rain in parts of Iowa on
Friday, Ohio officials warned of the possibility of mandatory water
conservation, and barges sat idle near shallow sections of the busy
Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
   ``I don't think the public understands the gravity of this
problem,'' Ohio Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard said Friday. ``They think
this is a great summer. From the beach point of view, this may be a
great summer. But from a water availability point of view, this
could be a dangerous summer.''
   In the South, reservoirs on the Savannah River in South Carolina
are at low levels comparable to their status during the severe
droughts of the 1930s and 1950s, the Army Corps of Engineers says.
   Several points in northwestern and north-central Iowa received
half an inch of rain or more Friday, but other areas got nothing
more than clouds when a warm front made its way southeast through
the region.
   ``This is probably our last chance for rain for a week,'' said
Chuck Myers, forecaster for the National Weather Service in Iowa.
He said weather patterns would shut off any moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico; Friday's rain came from a weak weather system that came
all the way from the Pacific.
   Iowa State extension climatologist Elwynn Taylor said Friday's
rain barely made a dent in the amount of moisture needed. He said
dry counties in northeastern Iowa need five inches of rain to get
back to normal growing conditions. The rest of the state needs
between two and four inches.
   In other developments, Iowa ordered irrigators and other heavy
water users along the Winnebago, English and Little Cedar rivers
and a section of the Cedar River to stop pumping, with officials
saying similar action is being considered to protect other
low-flowing streams.
   The weather service has predicted a continuation of the
unusually dry Midwestern weather through at least July 15, raising
the possibility of a 20-25 percent loss in corn yields as opposed
to the 10 percent loss suffered to date.
   Futures traders on Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis
commodities exchanges have been bidding up prices for future
delivery of grains and soybeans. On the Chicago Board of Trade,
corn futures have risen about 40 percent since May 1 and soybeans
have advanced about 35 percent, and cash prices have followed suit.
   In Ohio, the lieutenant governor was named by Gov. Richard
Celeste to head a special state agency task force being created to
draft recommendations for gubernatorial and legislative action in
response to the drought.
   Leonard said that while dry farms have gotten most of the
public's attention, ``In my opinion, an equally serious risk is
facing Ohio communities in terms of potential water shortages or
eventual contamination of water supplies in Ohio communities.''
   Leonard would not rule out the possibility of mandatory
restrictions. ``That would certainly be a last resort, but at this
point in time you can't rule anything in, or rule anything out,
until you get a good assessment of the problem,'' he said.
   About 1,000 barges were halted on the Mississippi near
Greenville, Miss., while nearly 700 barges were stranded on the
Ohio near Mound City, Ill., authorities said, with water down to 7
feet deep in spots, 2 feet too shallow for loaded barges.
   The Coast Guard shut down a 7-mile stretch of the Ohio near
Mound City on Tuesday to begin dredging a 2,100-foot channel, 11
feet deep by 250 feet wide. The Guard planned to reopen the Ohio to
traffic Thursday night, shifted that to Friday, then delayed the
opening again until Sunday because of dredging problems.
   The Mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in 1872. Eight dredges from Greenville to Cairo,
Ill., were working round-the-clock and only a few barges were
passing at a time.
   Water theft has become a new problem in Georgia's Henry County,
just south of Atlanta. Eight people have been cited for tapping
onto county water lines in the past four weeks.

<HEAD>Report Based on Pre-Drought Figures Predicts Higher Farm Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought is having a major impact on farm
income this year, but an analysis issued Friday by the Agriculture
Department showed that economists have not caught up the rapidly
developing situation.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service showed
that net cash income in 1988 will be even higher than predicted a
month ago _ in a range of $53 billion to $59 billion, compared with
a record $56 billion in 1987.
   Last month, as it had for some time, the agency forecast net
cash income _ the difference between gross cash income and cash
expenses _ at $50 billion to $55 billion, and the 1987 net at $57
billion.
   ``The forecast range for farmers' 1988 net cash income was
raised to reflect early June data, but it does not yet reflect
potential impacts of the drought,'' the report said.
   Prospects of higher feed costs and lower livestock prices have
reduced the outlook for cattle and hog producers.
   ``Lack of rainfall this spring raised concerns about pasture and
range conditions as cattle movements off spring pastures
increased,'' the report said. ``Conditions were the worst since
1934.''
   The report added: ``If marketings of (grain) fed cattle rise and
their prices drop enough to cause financial losses, feeder cattle
prices will also be pushed down.''
   A rise in hog slaughter could reduce hog prices in late summer
from the level of around $50 per 100 pounds in May, the report said.
   ``Despite lower income prospects for hog and cattle producers,
cash receipts for the livestock sector as a whole will about equal
last year, thanks to strength in poultry receipts,'' it said.

<DATELINE>OZARK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused Friday to delay the execution
of a man convicted of two murders and accused of 14 others and who
has asked to be executed as soon as possible.
   R. Gene Simmons 47, has been sentenced to die June 27. He was
convicted in May for the Russelville slayings of a woman who
reportedly had spurned his advances a year earlier and a man police
described as a chance victim.
   Simmons is scheduled to stand trial July 18 for the
Christmastime deaths of 14 relatives whose bodies were found at his
home in a rural area near Dover.
   Five of the bodies were found in the Simmons house by police who
came there after the Russellville shootings. The other nine bodies
were found the next day outside, in shallow graves and in the
trunks of two abandoned cars.
   In keeping with their instructions, Simmons' attorneys fought
the attempt to delay his death during a nearly two-hour hearing
before Franklin County Circuit Judge John S. Patterson.
   An attorney for the Rev. Louis J. Franz, chairman of Arkansas
Churches for Life, a group opposed to the death penalty, asked the
judge to delay the execution and to order an appeal. Arkansas law
doesn't provide for an automatic appeal of cases in which a
defendant is sentenced to death.
   The attorney, Mark S. Cambiano, also asked that Franz be allowed
to represent Simmons' interests even against Simmons' wishes.
   Simmons testified that he did not want Franz to represent him.
   ``It would not be in my best interest,'' he said, reiterating
his desire to be executed ``as ordered, when ordered.''
   The judge denied Cambiano's requests.

<HEAD>Graham: ``Quiet Religious Revival'' Taking Place in USSR</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Billy Graham said Friday he sensed
stirrings of a ``quiet religious revival'' in the Soviet Union due
in part to Kremlin reforms, but he called the reforms no substitute
for religious faith.
   Graham, who ended his fourth visit to the Soviet Union on
Friday, also said he was assured that some members of the
government are ``true believers,'' but he would not elaborate. His
10-day trip to the Soviet Union included meetings with church and
government officials.
   ``Perestroika means restructuring, but we must have spiritual
restructuring,'' the 69-year-old Southern Baptist evangelist said
in an interview.
   Perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program,
has included promises to loosen regulations on religious
denominations and their members in the officially atheist land.
   Soviet religious activists, however, say organized religious
groups remain under the tight control of the government and ruling
Communist Party.
   ``I think perestroika has generated a tremendous hope among the
people,'' Graham said. ``Some people say it's a false hope. I think
that if all Mr. Gorbachev is saying is going to come to pass, it is
going to be a very historic turn in this country.''
   Graham, who first visited the country in 1958, was an honored
guest at government-sanctioned ceremonies celebrating the 1,000th
anniversary of Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union.
   Graham, who also preached in the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1984,
said the crowds that formed to hear him preach in Moscow and Kiev
were the largest he had addressed in the country.
   ``For the first time, they put up amplification outside, and no
police held people back,'' he said. ``When I was here before, they
wouldn't shake hands. They were nervous or afraid.''
   Graham said Gorbachev's more liberal policies on self-expression
and ``incurably religious'' human nature had combined to rekindle
interest in religion.
   ``There is a quiet religious revival going on in Russia, in the
hearts of its people,'' Graham said. ``I think that under Stalin
and Khrushchev, and to a certain extent under Brezhnev, the people
were held back. Now it's been opened up some and will probably be
opened up more.''
   Graham said he thought Soviet authorities were stunned by the
``hunger for faith''shown by many citizens during the millennium
celebrations, which began June 5 and ended Friday.
   Graham was asked if the church could be sure of its future in a
land where atheism is official doctrine.
   ``Christianity has always grown under rulers who didn't believe
in Christ or in God. Yes, the (Soviet) government is atheistic. But
I believe that in this government there are true believers,'' added
Graham, who said he had been assured of this by Soviets.
   Graham's 1982 visit to the Soviet Union sparked controversy when
he told a news conference in Moscow that the church in the country
was free.
   Graham maintained Friday that he had said churches have ``a
measure of religious freedom'' but were not ``free in the sense
that we call freedom.''

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis is closing the gap on Republican George Bush in Utah, a
poll released Friday indicates.
   The Deseret News-KSL-TV poll found that 47 percent of those
polled favor Bush, while 38 percent prefer Dukakis.
   A similar poll two months ago found that 51 percent of those
questioned favored Bush and 36 percent favored Dukakis.
   The survey of 607 Utahns conducted May 31-June 1 has a margin of
error of 4 percent.
   Bush hopes President Reagan's popularity in western states will
help him carry the region this year. Reagan, who won his largest
pluralities of any state in Utah in 1980 and 1984, still has a job
approval rating of 69 percent here.

   About 220 Soviet citizens waving banners
reading ``We Are One Family'' and ``Our Goal Is Nuclear-Free
World'' began a month-long walking tour of the United States on
Friday with the aim of building friendship and lobbying for
disarmament.
   The Soviets, joined by as many as 100 Americans, planned to walk
to Philadelphia and then travel by bus to Moline, Ill., for a walk
across the Mississippi River to Des Moines, Iowa, where they will
celebrate the Fourth of July holiday.
   The group will fly from Des Moines to Los Angeles for a final
walk to San Francisco, ending with a mid-July rock concert in
Golden Gate Park.
   The group plans to walk as much as 15 miles a day and spend
nights in a mobile tent city.
   The tour is sponsored by International Peace Walk Inc., a
private, non-profit U.S. organization which is planning a
reciprocal walk from Odessa to Kiev in August involving between 200
and 250 Americans. The exchange began a year ago with a three-week
trek by 230 Americans from Leningrad to Moscow.
   Soviets taking part in the current peace walk represent each of
the 15 Soviet republics and include Vladimir Fedosov, a deputy of
the Supreme Soviet or parliament.
   Others include farmers, students, a firefighter from Chernobyl _
site of a Soviet nuclear power plant disaster in 1986 _ and Janis
Kipurs, winner of the bobsledding gold medal at the 1988 Winter
Olympic Games.
   The Soviet participants were selected by the Soviet Peace
Committee.
   ``We should put a red light in front of the arms race,'' Fedosov
told a rally at the West Front of the Capitol before the walk
began. He said the walk was ``one more attempt at diplomacy between
the peoples of our nations to make the world safe.''
   ``Our goal is a non-nuclear and non-violent world,'' said
Fedosov, a member of the Soviet commission that supervised
ratification of the recent U.S.-Soviet medium-range nuclear missile
treaty.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who will join the walk on July 3 in his
home state, called for an immediate halt in superpower production
of advanced long-range nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty,
a ban on missile test flights and rejection of Reagan's Star Wars
missile defense system.
   ``Now, before it's too late, let's stop the arms race from going
right into outer space,'' Harkin said. He urged that the two
countries cooperate instead to conduct joint space missions,
eliminate hunger, illiteracy and poverty, protect the environment
and improve education.
   ``We must recognize that the fate of the two superpowers is
inseparable,'' Harkin said. ``There is no U.S. security without
Soviet security. In the nuclear age, there is only common
security.''

<HEAD>Report Says Police Beatings, Arrests at Nagy Demonstrations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police beat several people and detained
at least 25 who took part in peaceful demonstrations to honor
leaders executed after the 1956 anti-Communist uprising, a
dissident said Friday.
   The detentions occurred during a rally Thursday afternoon in
downtown Budapest at which about 400 demonstrators called for
democracy and the rehabilitation of Imre Nagy, who was Hungary's
leader in 1956, dissident writer Miklos Haraszti said by telephone.
He was reached from Vienna at his Budapest apartment.
   Haraszti said all of those detained were released later.
   Well-known dissidents Roza Hodosan and underground publisher
Gabor Demszky were thrown to the floor of a police station and
beaten by officers in front of about 15 other detainees, he said.
   Witnesses to the rally said some people were injured when riot
police moved into the crowd, including dissident sociologist
Ottilia Solt, who was taken home ``in pretty bad shape,'' one
source reported privately.
   Earlier Thursday, demonstrators held a peaceful vigil at
unmarked graves in a Budapest cemetery where Nagy and some of his
associates are believed buried. They were marking 30 years since
official media published a Justice Ministry decree June 17, 1958,
announcing the death sentences.
   The afternoon rally was held at an eternal flame to Lajos
Batthyany, a Hungarian premier executed in the abortive 1848
revolution against Austria. Witnesses said it began peacefully with
20-30 people laying flowers at the base of the monument, then
rejoining the crowd.
   According to the witness accounts, dissident writer Miklos Tamas
Gaspar was detained when he tried to speak, and police took his
notes.
   Those in the crowd chanted ``Democracy! Democracy!'' and ``Nagy!
Nagy!'' and sang the national anthem. After about half an hour,
they moved toward the Danube River, whichdivides the historical
towns of Buda and Pest, then west to the huge white building that
houses the state television.
   Riot police moved in after Janos Kis, another dissident,
addressed the crowd from the steps of the building.
   Witnesses said his speech was largely drowned out by
demonstrators taunting police with chants of ``AVO!'' _ the dread
secret police under Matyas Rakosi, a protege of Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin.
   The uprising was sparked by popular revulsion for Rakosi, who
had dismissed Nagy as premier and expelled him from the Communist
Party early in 1956. It began Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for
a new government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary, and
Nagy was made premier of a new government the next day.
   On Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet troops and 2,500 tanks arrived in
Budapest to quell the revolts.
   Demands have increased for the rehabilitation of Nagy and some
associates who also were executed or sentenced to prison.
   One group speaking for Nagy is a 37-member committee called Let
Justice Prevail that includes his daughter Eszsebet. She lives in
Paris and attended the unveiling there Thursday of a monument to
her father.
   Rehabilitation of the uprising's leaders probably would require
approval from Moscow as well as the Hungarian Communist Party.
   Janos Kadar, who took over after the Soviets crushed the
uprising, still is president of the Hungarian party, a ceremonial
post, but he was replaced as general secretary last month by
Premier Karoly Grosz.

   Hundreds of barges sat idle Friday on the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers as a lingering drought kept water levels low, and officials
said Sunday would be the earliest that safe travel could resume.
   Drought has lowered channels in the rivers to about 7 feet in
spots _ 2 feet less than needed for loaded barges _ and officials
warned that aquatic life could suffer if the dry weather continues.
   Flow rates in the two rivers are so slow that more sediment than
normal is settling to the bottom, forming new sandbars that become
navigational hazards.
   ``It's not good,'' Ron Blake of the U.S. Coast Guard in Paducah,
Ky., said of conditions on the Ohio. ``Pretty much of the river is
bank now _ it's that shallow.''
   About 1,000 barges were halted on the Mississippi near
Greenville, Miss., waiting a turn through a narrow channel, while
nearly 700 barges were stuck on the Ohio awaiting completing of
dredging near Mound City, Ill., authorities said. Tow boat owners
were losing about $10,000 a day, officials said.
   Ed Green of the Army Corps of Engineers in Washington said the
Ohio is the nation's only inland waterway shut down because of
shallow water, and it is at its lowest levels since January 1969.
   Water levels stood at 7 feet to 8 feet on the Mississippi near
Greenville, said Robert Anderson of the Corps' Memphis, Tenn.
office. The river is at its lowest level there since authorities
began keeping records in 1872.
   Eight dredges were working round-the-clock from Greenville to
Cairo, Ill., to dig channels of at least 9 feet, Green said. ``It's
be pretty much clogged up until Sunday,'' he said.
   ``Right now the only things passing are the small tows, just a
few barges at a time.''
   The Coast Guard on Tuesday shut down a 7-mile stretch of the
Ohio near Mound City to begin dredging a 2,100-foot channel, 11
feet deep by 250 feet wide.
   Water depths of 8 feet in the troubled section have caused
numerous barge groundings in the past two weeks. The Guard planned
to reopen the Ohio to traffic Thursday night, shifted that to
Friday, then delayed the opening again until Sunday because of
dredging problems.
   Underwater cables, rocks and debris forced the Corps of
Engineers to delay the reopening, said Corps spokesman Chuck
Shumann in Louisville, Ky.
   Blake said 42 towboats were waiting to go downriver, while 26
needed to go upstream.
   The drought also is threatening aquatic life in the Ohio because
of low oxygen, and prompting algae growth that can taint drinking
water, a river monitoring official said.
   Peter Tennant, water quality programs manager of the Ohio River
Valley Sanitation Commission, said local water treatment operations
can make the algae-contaminated water safe, but can't eliminate the
bad taste.
   Tennant also said that if the drought continues for two weeks
more, the oxygen level could drop to the point where it would
affect the reproductive quality of fish.

<HEAD>Archbishop Who Defied Vietnam Over Church Control Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Philippe Nguyen Kim Dien of
Hue, Vietnam, has died after spending his last years under house
arrest for defying communist attempts to control the country's
Roman Catholic Church. He was 67.
   The official Vietnam News Agency, in a report monitored in
Bangkok on Friday, said Dien died of an unspecified illness on June
8 at Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   A Vatican spokesman in Rome reported that the Vatican sent a
telegram to Cardinal Trinh Van Can, archbishop of Hanoi, saying
Pope John Paul II praised Dien for his courage.
   ``The Holy Father joins in the sorrow of the bishops and of all
the Catholic community in Vietnam,'' the telegram read. ``He
commends to the Lord the courageous pastor who faithfully testified
the Gospel in a life of untiring service for the people of God.''
   It was signed by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, Vatican secretary
of state.
   Dien was barred from priestly work and put under house arrest in
1984 for urging priests not to join the Committee for Solidarity of
Patriotic Vietnamese Catholics. The communist government of Vietnam
formed the committee in 1983 and critics said it was designed to
control the church.
   Authorities apparently made no serious attempt to replace Dien,
however.
   The Vietnamese news report, dated Thursday, said a memorial
service was held on Monday in Hue. The Ho Chi Minh City archbishop,
Nguyen Van Binh, held a funeral service in Hue on Wednesday which
was attended by Communist Party and government officials concerned
with religious affairs, it said.
   The Vatican said Kim was born in March 1921 in Vinh Long, a
traditional center of the Catholic Church in the Mekong River Delta
in southern Vietnam; was ordained in July 1947 and became a bishop
in 1961.
   There are 4 million to 5 million Catholics among Vietnam's
largely Buddhist population of about 63 million.
   The Vatican, Vietnamese refugees and other sources charge that
after the communists came to power in 1975, they closed seminaries,
jailed priests and took other steps to repress the Catholic Church.
   Authorities have moved toward reconciliation since Nguyen Van
Linh became Communist Party chief in December 1986. A seminary was
reopened and many priests were freed from political
``re-education'' camps where they were confined since 1975.
   Relations with the Vatican also improved somewhat, although
Hanoi has condemned the Vatican's scheduled canonization this
Sunday of 117 people who were martyred in Vietnam in the 18th and
19th centuries.
   Vietnamese officials say the Vatican has allowed anti-communist
Vietnamese exiles to use the occasion to criticize Hanoi.

   An escaped killer from Pennsylvania
and his companion, who were arrested in Idaho after tipsters saw
the case on NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' have waived extradition.
   Jon Evans Yount, 50, who escaped from the Rockview State
Correctional Institution 26 months ago, was taken into custody
Wednesday in his Coeur d'Alene garden, FBI agent T. C. Brock said.
   His companion, Diana Brodbeck, 45, was arrested when she
returned to the house that night. The two were being held on
charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
   They will remain in the Kootenai County Jail until Pennsylvania
authorities arrive, probably within 10 days, authorities said.
   Yount, who was living in Coeur d'Alene under the alias James
Marvin Forsgren, was sentenced to life in prison for his conviction
on first-degree murder and rape charges in the 1966 slaying of
Pamela Sue Rimer, a student in his high school mathematics class in
Luthersberg, Pa.
   While walking home from her school bus stop, the teen-ager was
beaten, stabbed and raped before her throat was slit.
   Since Yount's escape from an unsupervised detail at the prison
farm, police have tracked leads in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Montreal
and Wyoming. But they were finally tipped off to his whereabouts
after Yount's story was featured on the television program last
month, Brock said.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Says Modern Steel Could Have Resisted Collapse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fuel tank collapse that fouled water in
three states would have only been a leak if Ashland Oil Inc. had
used modern steel instead of weaker 1940s steel to build the tank
in 1987, a federal agency said Friday.
   A National Bureau of Standards study agreed with earlier
findings of the Battelle Memorial Institute that a dime-sized flaw
caused the 48-foot tank wall to split in a fraction of a second,
said Richard N. Wright, director of the agency's center for
building technology.
   Modern steel could have resisted total collapse, he said.
   ``Virtually every older tank may be susceptible to this type of
accident,'' said U.S. Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., who requested the
NBS probe and introduced a bill that would raise construction
standards on large fuel tanks.
   The flaw was in the steel before the 4 million-gallon tank was
built in Cleveland around 1940, said Battelle, a private Columbus,
Ohio-based institute hired by Ashland to investigate the cause of
the spill. Ashland dismantled it and reconstructed the tank at its
Floreffe Terminal south of Pittsburgh in 1987.
   It burst while being filled Jan. 2 during freezing weather.
   Even without the flaw, the steel did not meet current industry
standards, becoming brittle below 80 degrees, said Wright. No
standards existed when Ashland first erected the tank.
   Modern steel retains its strength at zero degrees, he said.
   The accident sent about 700,000 gallons of oil into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers, the source of drinking water for
communities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.
   Ashland has admitted failing to obtain the necessary local
permits before erecting the tank. The company has assumed
responsibility for the accident and has already paid $6 million of
the $7 million clean-up costs, plus $1.2 million in damage claims
to government agencies, businesses and individuals.
   The NBS and the American Petroleum Institute say they do not
know the age of the nation's several thousand large fuel tanks.
Wright said he believed a substantial number are made of old steel.
   ``A hunter's stray bullet, a pick-up truck whose brakes fail,
even a sledge hammer blow could explode some tanks,'' Walgren said.
   The difficulty of preventing and detecting flaws underscores the
importance of using strong steel, said Wright.

   The Foreign Office on Friday announced the
expulsions of an Israeli diplomat and a PLO official following a
British court's conviction on weapons charges of a Palestinian who
was accused of spying for Israel.
   The Foreign Office said that Israeli attache Arie Regev and the
PLO's London press officer, Zaki al Hawa, were no longer welcome
because of activities incompatible with their diplomatic duties. It
said they must leave the country by the end of June.
   The department also made clear that Britain had expressed
irritation that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had not kept
Britain informed of its operations in Britain.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ``We regret
that her majesty's government has seen fit to take measures of the
kind adopted. Israel did not act against any British interests.''
   The decision follows a London trial of 28-year-old Palestinian
Ishmael Sowan, convicted Wednesday at the Old Bailey court of
possessing explosives, grenades and rifles. He was sentenced
Thursday to 11 years in jail.
   Prosecutors said Sowan kept the arms for Abder Mustapha, a
Palestine Liberation Organization member. Mustapha was suspected of
arranging the murder in London of an Arab cartoonist, Ali Naji Awad
Al-Adhami.
   At the same time, Sowan was spying on Mustapha for Mossad, the
prosecution alleged.
   The Foreign Office said it understood that the PLO official, al
Hawa, was a member of Force 17, whose function is to provide
personal security for PLO leader Yasser Arafat and senior officials
overseas.
   In its coverage of the trial, The Times of London said the
Mossad failed to tell British authorities of the presence in
Britain of Mustapha. Britain had made an exclusion order against
Mustapha and was unaware he had returned to Britain.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, quoted unidentified
government officials as saying the exclusion order against Mustapha
was because of suspicion about his activities but that there was no
evidence he had committed an offense.
   Sowan was arrested in August when police were investigating the
shooting of Al-Adhami.
   He testified that the weapons found in his house in the eastern
port of Hull belonged to Mustapha. Sowan was not a suspect in the
shooting of the cartoonist. Police said Mustapha fled to the Middle
East after Al-Adhami was shot.
   The London Times said Mustapha was linked to the murder of three
Israeli vacationers on a yacht at Larnaca, Cyprus, in June 1986. He
was also wanted for an attack on an Israeli El Al bus in West
Germany in 1970, the newspaper said.
   On Friday the Foreign Office summoned Israeli Ambassador Yehuda
Avner and told him Arie Regev should leave. It later summoned
Faycal Aouidha, head of the PLO in London, and told him the Home
Secretary had ordered the departure of Zaki Al Hawa.
   The Foreign Office also confirmed that the Israeli Embassy was
told last year that an attache at the embassy, Jacob Barrad, who
was out of the country, would not be welcome to return.
   Regev, who has been in London since 1984, and Barrad were
thought to be the officials at the embassy who coordinated the work
of Mossad, Press Association said.

<HEAD>Writers Reject `Settlement Offer' From Producers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The East and West Coast leaders of the
striking Writers Guild of America voted Friday to reject a $71
million contract offer that movie and television producers had
hoped would settle the 15-week-old walkout.
   The unanimous vote was held during a telephone conference call
between the union's two governing boards, said West Coast executive
director Brian Walton.
   He said that only ``a very small part of the meeting'' was
devoted to considering whether to accept the contract, with most of
it spent reviewing details of the offer, which was rejected
Thursday by the guild's negotiating committee.
   Members of the 9,500-member union will meet Wednesday in New
York and Los Angeles to vote on the contract. Union officials said
they expected a rejection despite pressure from a union splinter
group to sign a contract.
   Walton said he believed producers intended to divide the union
Thursday by making an offer they knew would be rejected.
``Presumably they wanted to see if the membership would follow the
leadership ... that's the only explanation I can give for the
offer.''
   Walton characterized the offer by the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers as ``quite better than the previous
offer,'' but still not acceptable in the area of domestic
television and foreign residuals for reruns.
   ``We are very disappointed. We have nothing more to give,'' said
producers' spokesman Herb Steinberg.
   While no new talks were scheduled, Walton said the guild has
offered to resume negotiations.
   The rejected offer represented an across-the-board increase of
14.7 percent over a four-year contract and a value of $71 million,
Steinberg said. The producers' previous offer was valued by the
alliance at $52 million.

<HEAD>Reagan Says He's Pleased with Latest Trade Figure </HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Friday that he was
pleased with the latest narrowing in the trade deficit and
indicated that it would not be a ``terrible calamity'' if the
deficit does not return to zero.
   The monthly trade deficit shrank to $9.9 billion in April from
$11.7 billion in March, the best showing in more than three years,
the Commerce Department reported this week.
   Asked during an interview on Cable News Network's ``Moneyline''
if he thought the report signaled that the trade deficit problem
for the United States was cured, Reagan replied:
   ``Well, it seems to be consistently going down now. ... And last
month was the lowest that we've had.
   ``Actually, I think that is a reasonable trade deficit some
place along the line,'' he said, adding that such a deficit ``is
not the terrible calamity that some people have pointed it out'' to
be.
   Reagan left unclear whether he would like to see the deficit
decline further. The trade deficit is the difference between
imports and exports.
   ``We are the biggest exporter in the world. We are also the
biggest importer in the world,'' he said.
   If the United States started trying only to sell to foreign
nations and not to buy goods from them, that could create ``some of
kind of economic problems worldwide, and that would affect us.''
   Last year, the trade shortfall was a record $170.3 billion.

<TEXT>
   Roxanne Pulitzer, whose 1982 divorce trial
featured details of cocaine use, extramarital sex and jet-set
hijinks, told members of the Florida Bar on Friday that lawyers and
judges cost her custody of her two children.
   The Palm Beach divorce case ``almost destroyed the children,''
she said about her twins, then 5. When the sex-and-drug allegations
were outlined, ``Mack and Zack went out the window ... all it was
was proving me an unfit mother.''
   Ms. Pulitzer told the family law section of the Florida Bar
meeting that lawyers for her husband, Peter Pulitzer, offered her
total custody of the children if she agreed to a financial
settlement.
   When she refused, they twice prevented a reconciliation and it
became ``a war between lawyers,'' she said.
   Circuit Judge Carl Harper awarded custody to her husband because
the newspaper heir's lawyers ``created'' him into a thoroughly
reliable, loving parent while painting her as a lesbian, adultress,
drug-user and uncaring mother, she said.
   ``Judge Harper's final decree stripped me naked far more than
Playboy ever did,'' she said, referring to her posing for the
male-oriented magazine after the trial.
   Harper cited ``flagrant acts of adultery and other gross marital
misconduct'' for finding her unsuitable as a mother. Her appeal of
his ruling failed.
   Ms. Pulitzer, who is on a nationwide tour publicizing a book she
wrote about the divorce, said she often speaks to divorce lawyers
in efforts to prevent them from ignoring the needs of their
clients' children.
   In her book, ``The Prize Pulitzer,'' she blames her ex-husband
for nearly everything that went wrong.
   Asked what she thought of Ms. Pulitzer's criticism of her
colleagues, family-practice attorney Cynthia Stump Swanson of
Gainesville said: ``I agree with her to a certain extent. Lawyers
are supposed to represent their clients but not to the detriment of
the children.''
   A newly developing ``guardian program'' that intervenes in a
divorce suit solely on behalf of the children ``would have made a
big difference,'' said another divorce lawyer who heard the speech,
Nancy Rainey Palmer of Casselberry.

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday it would
support new restrictive measures in Hong Kong to stop a flood of
Vietnamese boat people if the rules are applied humanely and
according to United Nations standards.
   The department issued a statement that it ``understands'' a
decision by British authorities in Hong Kong to incarcerate newly
arriving boat people as illegal aliens. Any arrivees who can't
prove they fled to avoid persecution will be sent back to Vietnam,
according to the rules imposed on Tuesday.
   Nearly 8,000 boat people have arrived in Hong Kong so far this
year, compared to 650 for the same period in 1987, and the new
measures are designed to deter more people from coming.
   Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian nations have agreed to be
``first asylum'' countries for refugees passing through on their
way to the West, but the flood of boat people is taxing their
willingness, the department said.
   In their defense, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong
have complained that the United States and other industrialized
nations that have promised to resettle refugees are not taking
enough of them.
   The State Department's statement _ aimed at all those countries,
not just Kong Kong _ reflected resignation among U.S. experts that
Southeast Asian nations are moving toward steps to stop the influx
and concern that that the methods might be too harsh.
   In recent months, for example, the United States has accused
Thailand of pushing overcrowded and leaky boats with asylum-seekers
back out to sea.
   The department said it accepted the Hong Kong rules because
authorities had given assurances that:
   _Arriving boat people will be let into the country, not pushed
back to sea.
   _Everyone who arrives will get a chance to apply for refugee
status.
   _Those whose applications are rejected ``will be housed in
humane and safe holding centers.''
   ``In view of these firm assurances that the new policy will be
implemented in a reasonable and responsible manner, the United
States understands the action which the British and Hong Kong
authorities have concluded they must take in order to preserve
first asylum for refugees,'' the department said.
   ``We would expect that the screening program would apply UNHCR's
current criteria for determination of refugee status for Vietnamese
boat people and that the Vietnamese would be informed of their
right to seek refugee status,'' the statement said.
   ``We would be prepared to support the action of the British and
Hong Kong in that case,'' it said.

   Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair said a
celebration Friday was the first time she has commemorated the
landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing organized prayer in
public schools.
   ``There wasn't anything to celebrate before. We were still
struggling,'' said Mrs. O'Hair, 70, before festivities celebrating
the 25th anniversary of a related court decision that resulted from
a suit she filed.
   Now, she said, ``We've made it. We're here. There is no way that
we can be pushed out of society any more. There are too many
atheists now.''
   The Supreme Court in 1963 outlawed daily Bible reading in public
schools, based on a landmark ruling the previous year that
organized school prayer violated the Constitution's First Amendment
prohibition against any state establishment of religion.
   Mrs. O'Hair _ then Madalyn Murray _ in 1959 had complained that
her son, Bill, was being required to pray in his public schools in
Baltimore.
   ``There has been a long struggle,'' said Mrs. O'Hair, referring
to continuing hostility and challenges to the court victories
against organized prayer.
   American Atheists, the organization Mrs. O'Hair founded, began
the anniversary celebration Friday with a ribbon-cutting planned
primarily for reporters to see its new headquarters. The building
cost $1.75 million before renovations, and was paid for in cash, as
is the group's custom, Mrs. O'Hair said.
   Over the weekend, the atheists planned tours of the headquarters
and a celebration of the summer solstice. About 200 people were
expected, said Rob Sherman, the group's national spokesman.
   Mrs. O'Hair's son Jon and granddaughter Robin Murray-O'Hair,
Bill's daughter, work with her. Mrs. O'Hair says she does not
discuss Bill, who has become a Christian. The headquarters has a
staff of 16 and four volunteers.
   The organization has a budget of about $750,000 this year, Mrs.
O'Hair said, and it has 38,000 families as members and chapters in
35 states.

<HEAD>Murdoch Asks FCC Permission To Put Boston TV Station in
Independent Trust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Rupert Murdoch on Friday proposed to
put his Boston UHF television station in an independent trust to
comply with government rules barring common ownership of a
newspaper and TV station in the same city.
   A waiver allowing Murdoch to own WFXT-TV and the Boston Herald
expires June 30, and although he won the right in court to request
an extension of the waiver, Murdoch had said he would sell the TV
station.
   But the media magnate said Friday he had decided to avail
himself of the trust option, which is allowed by the Federal
Communications Commission as a method of complying with the
cross-ownership rule.
   Murdoch proposed to the FCC that the trust be managed by former
Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts and former New York Gov. Hugh
Carey.
   Lawrence Kessler, general counsel of Murdoch's company, News
America Publishing Inc., said the trust was chosen because ``it
seemed a more appropriate thing to do right now. It lets us remain
the beneficiary of what we believe will be a valuable property.''
   Under terms of the trust agreement, Murdoch would relinquish
control of the station but would still receive profits. The station
could not be sold for less than $35 million. It could be sold for
more than that amount if Murdoch agrees, but he would be able to
consider only the ``financial terms and conditions'' of the
proposal.
   The station has been valued at between $30 million and $50
million.
   The agreement also provides that the trust would be terminated
if the station were sold or ceased operation or if Murdoch sells
the Boston Herald.
   Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, a public interest law firm, said he was concerned that the
agreement would allow the station to be held by the trust
indefinitely.
   ``That's very troubling,'' Schwartzman said in an interview.
``These guys (Brooke and Carey) aren't broadcasters. We want to
license people who are going to be broadcasters on a permanent
basis.''
   Murdoch in March sold the New York Post for $37 million to real
estate developer Peter Kalikow to comply with the cross-ownership
rule.
   Murdoch had engaged in a bitter battle with Congress over
temporary waivers allowing him to own the two Boston properties and
the New York Post and WNYW-TV in New York.
   Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., late
last year pushed through the Congress a little noticed measure
prohibiting the FCC from eliminating or modifying the
cross-ownership rule and barring it from extending any waivers of
the rule.
   In March, Murdoch successfully challenged the legislation in the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won the right to request an
extension of his waiver from the FCC.
   However, he decided against a further extension, saying the
station had ``suffered as the result of a regulatory cloud.''

   Actress Jane Fonda's apology for her
controversial trip to Hanoi during the Vietnam War apparently won't
appease all her critics, but others say they are ready to forgive
and forget.
   Veteran groups in Waterbury and Holyoke, Mass., have been
protesting Fonda's plans to film a movie in their communities in
August because of her 1972 trip to North Vietnan.
   In a television interview, Fonda apologizes for her actions
during the trip but not for her anti-war message.
   ``I am proud of most of what I did, and I am very sorry for some
of what I did,'' Fonda said in an interview for Friday night's
ABC's ``20-20''.
   ``I was trying to help end the killing, end the war. But there
were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it, and ... I
am very sorry that I hurt them,'' she said.
   Joseph Griggs, a spokesman for the Veterans Coalition Against
Hanoi Jane, said Fonda must back up her words with action, such as
returning to Vietnam to seek the return of prisoners of war still
unaccounted for.
   ``I would have to say that's a very nice beginning,'' he said of
her apology. But ``it's been our position for some time now that
efforts have to go along with the words,'' Griggs said.
   Gaetano Russo, head of the coalition, called the apology
``typical Fonda hogwash.''
   But Korean War veteran John Sarlo of Waterbury said of the
apology, ``I guesd that's something we can be grateful for and
appreciate.''
   The Rev. John A. McColley, rector of St. Michael's Episcopal
Church in Naugatuck and a Vietnam veteran, said: ``I'm just about
absolutely certain (the apology) is genuine and well done. She made
her apology.''
   In the interview, Fonda said she was sorry for being
photographed aboard a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, saying
``that was a ... thoughtless and careless thing to have done.''
   She also apologized for saying that POWs were not tortured.
   ``They suffered enough. They didn't need to hear from me,'' she
said.

<HEAD>4,000 Strikers March to Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 workers from an
agricultural machinery plant marched to Parliament Friday to
protest wage reductions, their demonstration cheered by about 1,000
onlookers.
   Employees of the Zmaj factory in the Zemun industrial suburb
crowded the steps of the building, carrying national and Communist
Party flags. They demanded meetings with government officials and
shouted ``We want changes!''
   A severe austerity program imposed by the communist government
links pay to productivity and has forced many companies to reduce
wages. For workers at the Zmaj plant, it meant a 9 percent cut in
April and another of 4 percent cut in May.
   Inflation is running at an annual rate of about 170 percent in
Yugoslavia and the foreign debt of $21 billion. Living standards
have fallen by about one-third since 1980.
   As they marched through the city toward Parliament, the workers
chanted ``Down with bureaucracy!'' ``More bread!'' and ``We want
better lives!''
   A dispatch from the official news agency Tanjug quoted Ljubisa
Krstic as saying he was paid $115 last month, but should have
received $50 more.
   ``I worked overtime in vain,'' he said. ``They cheated us. This
is why we came here.''
   Police reinforcements were called in to keep passersby and
supporters of the strikers away.
   A delegation of protesters was admitted to the building for
talks with officials.
   Vice Premier Janez Zemljaric and some members of Parliament
emerged later to address the crowd, but bystanders gathered in a
park across the street shouted ``Down with the government!'' and
``Thieves! Thieves!''
   After four hours, the protesters accepted an offer from
officials of buses to take them back to Zemun.
   About 1,000 onlookers refused to leave immediately and continued
chanting. At least one person was arrested during an attempt to
break the police line, but the crowd later left peacefully.

   Bruce Springsteen and his wife, actress
Julianne Phillips, have separated after three years of marriage,
her publicist confirmed Friday.
   ``Yes. I'd rather not comment on it. You can say it's been
confirmed,'' said Molly Madden, Miss Phillips' spokeswoman. She
said neither Springsteen nor Miss Phillips has filed for divorce.
   Springsteen, 38, the working-class kid who rose from the bar
bands of Asbury Park, N.J., to become one of the world's most
popular rock stars, is in Europe with his ``Tunnel of Love''
concert tour.
   Miss Phillips, 28, is filming ``Fletch II'' with comedian Chevy

   The couple met backstage in Los Angeles during his ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' concert tour in 1984. They were married in a private,
midnight ceremony in a church near her family's home in Lake
Oswego, Ore., on May 13, 1985.

<HEAD>Soviet Television Broadcasts Interview with CIA Defector</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet television aired an interview with CIA
defector Edward Lee Howard Friday and showed him at a country
dacha, walking down Moscow's Arbat shopping street and discussing
his life since he arrived here in 1985.
   The broadcast included a home movie Howard made for his family
during travels around the Soviet Union. He said he was happy, but
he also said he had few friends.
   Howard's wife and son did not accompany him to the Soviet Union.
His defection to Moscow was the first by someone known to have
worked for the CIA.
   He shed little light during the interview on how he managed to
slip through FBI surveillance of his home in Santa Fe, N.M. and
reach Soviet soil.
   Howard did say he traveled to Hungary since defecting and that
his disagreements with the Central Intelligence Agency were
``mostly political. I am opposed to secret methods.''
   In a previous interview on Soviet TV, Howard said he was granted
political asylum in the Soviet Union and had never ``done anything
that would damage or threaten my country's security.''
   The Soviets reportedly paid Howard $6,000 for information which
compromised many CIA operations in the Soviet Union and is believed
to have led to the arrest and execution of at least one Soviet
working for the CIA.
   Howard spoke mostly in English during the Friday interview and
his remarks were translated into Russian. While strolling down the
Arbat, he chatted in Russian with his interviewer.
   The home movie included footage of churches, which he said were
one of his favorite sights in the Soviet Union. He said he has
always been a Roman Catholic, but it was not clear where he
worshiped.
   He was shown inside his dacha, which appeared plush by Soviet
standards. He said he also had an apartment in Moscow, but this was
not shown, perhaps for security reasons.
   Howard said he met in Moscow at length with David Wise, an
American based in Washington who has written several books critical
of the CIA. The defector said he might write a book on his
experiences after a time.
   Howard, 36, went to work for the CIA in 1981 and was fired by
the agency in June 1983. Some sources said he quit because he was
angry at being assigned to Moscow, and others because his superiors
became concerned about his personal life.

   The Defense Department has agreed to accept
penalties from the Environmental Protection Agency if it violates
agreements with EPA to clean up ``Superfund'' toxic waste sites,
EPA announced Friday.
   In such a case, the department will seek appropriations to make
the actual transfer of funds from its pocket to EPA's _ $5,000 for
the first week of violation and $10,000 for subsequent weeks.
   The agreement, similar to one reached last month with the Energy
Department, provides for the administrator of EPA to settle any
disputes between the staffs of EPA and the department over whether
a violation has occurred.
   Amendments to the Superfund law in 1986 required EPA and the two
departments to try to agree on a penalty formula, leaving the
actual funds to be appropriated by Congress.
   If EPA assesses a penalty, the installation affected must report
the facts to Congress.
   ``We think this provides greater incentive to comply,'' said
Christopher Grundler, head of EPA's federal facilities hazardous
waste compliance office. ``The colonel commanding a base doesn't
get to be a general if he has to march up to Congress to explain
what's been going on.''
   Federal facilities such as air bases are frequently among the
most contaminated waste sites because of years of neglect of such
problems as the disposal of powerful solvents used to clean
aircraft engines.
   Though EPA can list such sites on its Superfund priority list,
the owning agency is responsible for cleanup, and EPA may spend
none of its own funds there.
   EPA must negotiate cleanup agreements in such instances. The
Justice Department has claimed that any legislation requiring EPA
to order cleanups would unconstitutionally infringe on the
president's powers to direct the executive branch.
   Congressional investigations have documented widespread
violations of waste handling laws at defense facilities and have
estimated that tens of billions of dollars will be needed for
cleanup. Some members of Congress have accused particular bases of
ignoring their waste problems.
   The Defense Department has been devoting increasing amounts to
cleanups and now spends about $400 million a year, according to
Grundler.
   EPA has placed 29 defense sites on the priority list, has
proposed 15 more and expects to add another 50 to 70, Grundler
said. There are ``two or three'' Energy Department installations on
the list, and more will be added, he said.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday
urged scientists to work with politicians to combat global economic
problems in the same way they spurred attempts to protect the
Earth's ozone layer.
   Kohl, accepting an honorary doctorate of laws from Toronto
University, said he and the six other leaders eeting in Toronto
next week need help from scientists if they are to meet their
challenges.
   ``We will use all means at our disposal to promote stable,
non-inflationary world economic growth,'' Kohl said. ``We will
resolutely combat global protectionism of any kind.''
   He said they also would have to find ways of keeping developed
countries from overproducing food while the poorest countries,
especially in Africa, have increasingly less food.
   They likewise will have to improve the economy of the Third
World, including finding a way to ease the developing nations'
indebtedness, Kohl said.
   ``All these crucial problems pertaining to the world economy and
the international debt situation cannot be solved by any one
country alone, regardless of its economic strength,'' he said.
   ``These problems ... present challenges that require cooperation
between politicians and scientists,'' Kohl said. ``We need
scientific and technological innovation.''
   He said politicians need scientists as an ``early warning
system'' to sound the alarm about threats in nature, technology and
society as they warned about the dangers that chlorofluorocarbons
from refrigerants, foam and aerosols pose to the Earth's protective
ozone layer.
   ``Those warnings have prompted global efforts to restrict
further still the production and use of such substances,'' Kohl
said.
   The West German chancellor, who addressed the Canadian
Parliament on Thursday, also paid a visit to David Peterson,
premier of Ontario. Toronto, which is hosting the economic summit
conference starting Sunday, is capital of Ontario, Canada's
wealthiest and most populous province.
   Kohl then went to Kitchener, Ontario, one hour to the southwest
of Toronto, for a speech to the German-Canadian community. The
ethnic group, consisting of more than 2 million people, is the
third largest in Canada after the British and French Canadians.

<TEXT>
   The Church of England said Friday night that four
British legislators will travel to Iran in an effort to improve
relations, hoping that this could lead to the release of three
Britons kidnapped in Lebanon.
   An announcement from the residence of Robert Runcie, archbishop
ofCanterbury, said the church had organized the mission at the
invitation of the Iranian government.
   The delegation is scheduled to leave Sunday and meet with
high-ranking Iranian officials in Tehran.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said: ``We have been informed but not
consulted. As far as we are concerned it is a privately organized
visit.''
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon and it is believed that most are held captive by members of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, movement.
   One of the missing Britons is Terry Waite, 49, Runcie's foreign
affairs adviser, who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, during his fifth
mission to seek the freedom of abducted Westerners.
   Waite had previously negotiated the release of 10 captives in
the Middle East, including prisoners in Iran and Libya.
   The other kidnapped Britons are John McCarthy, 31, a television
journalist missing since Feb. 17, 1986, and Alec Collett, 64, a New
York-based journalist who disappeared March 25, 1985, while on
assignment for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.
   An Islamic extremist organization claimed Collett had been
killed, but his body has not been found and there has been no proof
that he is dead.
   Brian Keenan, 36, from the British province of Northern Ireland,
was abducted April 11, 1986, while walking to the American
University of Beirut where he worked as an English teacher. He
holds an Irish passport.
   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Iran and Britain reduced their diplomatic staffs last summer in
a series of retaliatory expulsions following the beating of a
British diplomat in Tehran and the shoplifting arrest of an Iranian
envoy in Britain. Iran now has only one diplomat in London and
Britain has one in Tehran.
   The four lawmakers in the mission to Iran are Cyril Townsend and
Robert Hicks of the governing Conservative Party; Thomas Clarke of
the Labor Party and Lord Tordoff of the Social Liberal Democrats.
   Runcie spokeswoman Eve Keatley said John Lyttle, from Runcie's
public affairs office, was instrumental in arranging the mission.
She said Lyttle was in Iran and met with senior government figures.
   ``The group is not going to negotiate for the return of
hostages. It is a fact-finding mission to find ways to improve
relations with Iran which could lead to the freeing of Terry Waite
and the other British hostages,'' Mrs. Keatley said.
   ``We have repeatedly made it clear we are not prepared to be
party to any deal which would indicate in any way that
hostage-taking pays dividends,'' she added.
   On June 10, Britain and Iran agreed during talks in London to
compensate each other for damages to their diplomatic offices.
   The British Embassy and consular officers in Tehran were damaged
by mobs in the late 1970s and the Iranian Embassy in London was
burned in 1980 during a commando assault to rescue hostages in the
building.
   Under the agreement, Britain will pay Iran the equivalent of
$3.2 million and Iran will pay Britain $1.6 million.
   Waite's brother, John Waite, said of the church mission: ``I am
sure this would be Terry's way to advance the cause of the
hostages. He is on record as saying that he didn't believe in deals.
   ``But he was a great believer in discovering the other person's
point of view and finding common ground. That is what the
delegation is all about.''
   The Friends of John McCarthy, a group formed to push for his
release, also welcomed the mission.
   ``We support all efforts aimed at bringing the hostages home. We
are glad that this mission is being organized under the auspices of
the Church of England,'' said a spokesman.
   ``We hope that dialogue with the Iranian authorities will help
to create an atmosphere for the release of hostages.... This
mission underlines the need to talk to all those who can aid their
freedom.''

<HEAD>Miguel Pinero, Author of `Short Eyes,' Dead in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO PEREZ RIVERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miguel Pinero, the former prisoner who turned
his jail experiences into the prize-winning play ``Short Eyes,''
has died in a Manhattan hospital, the New York Public Theater
announced Friday. He was 41.
   Pinero died Thursday of cirrhosis of the liver, said Reva
Cooper, a theater spokeswoman.
   ``Short Eyes,'' Pinero's most famous play, was based partly on
his own jail experiences and its first draft was written while the
author was still in prison, Cooper said. It is set in the day room
of a cell block and deals with how other prisoners deal with a new
inmate charged with the rape of a young girl.
   The play opened in 1974 at the off-off-Broadway Riverside
Theater as a part of the Third World Project, moved to the Public
Theater and then to the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center
and won the coveted New York Drama Critics Award for best American
play of the season. It was made into a movie in 1976.
   At the time of his death, Pinero was writing another play for
the Public, titled ``Every Form of Refuge Has Its Price,'' Cooper
said. The play takes place in the intensive care unit of a
Manhattan hospital, very similar to the one where he died, said
Joseph Papp, head of the New York Public Theater.
   ``Pinero was the first major writer to come out of the large
numbers of Puerto Ricans that came to New York in the '50s,'' said
Papp. ``He was a mentor for Reinaldo Povod _ another successful
Puerto Rican dramatist _ who will pave the way for other young
Latino writers.''
   In a reference to the violent, striking play that cemented
Pinero's reputation, Papp said that Pinero ``brought a hard-hitting
realism to the stage that shook it up.''
   Pinero's other plays include ``The Sun Always Shines for the
Cool,'' set in a hustlers' bar, and ``Eulogy for a Small Time
Thief.''
   Miguel Antonio Gomez Pinero was born in Gurabo, Puerto Rico,
Dec. 19, 1946.
   His family moved to New York when he was 4. A few years later
his father abandoned the family and ``we were thrown out to the

   As a young man, Pinero was in and out of jail several times,
convicted of robbery and other charges, and was sent finally to
Sing Sing, where he started writing ``Short Eyes.''
   He was also an actor, and had a small role in the film version
of that play.
   Pinero was married to Juanita Rameize in 1977, and they were
divorced two years later.
   Papp said the Public will hold a memorial on June 24 for Pinero.
According to Pinero's wishes, his body will be cremated, Papp said.

<HEAD>Soviet and Bulgarian Cosmonauts Land After 10-Day Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spacecraft carrying two Soviets and a Bulgarian
cosmonaut landed softly Friday on the sweltering, dusty plains of
Soviet Central Asia at the end of a 10-day mission, state-run media
reported.
   ``Ain't it hot down here on earth!'' mission commander Anatoly
Solovov said as he clambered out of the Soyuz-TM capsule, the Tass
news agency reported.
   The capsule landed by parachute 124 miles southeast of
Dzhezkazgan, a city in Kazakhstan about 1,300 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   A chase helicopter and special trucks with huge wheels raced
across the plains to the landing spot, reaching it minutes after
touchdown, Tass said.
   Although the launch had been broadcast live on Soviet
television, the moment of landing was not televised. The three
cosmonauts were shown sitting in chairs beside the capsule.
   Solovyov sipped hot tea to quench his thirst in temperatures
that reached 108 degrees.
   Other crewmembers were Alexander Alexandrov of Omurtag,
Bulgaria, and Viktor P. Savinkyh of the Soviet Union. They blasted
off June 7 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and two days
later linked their capsule with the Soviet Union's orbiting space
station Mir, Russian for peace.
   Soviet television broadcast live footage Friday morning of the
three cosmonauts saying goodbye to Mir's crew. The three were shown
kissing and embracing the Mir crewmembers _ Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov _ and then entering an airlock en route to the capsule.
   During their 10-day mission aboard Mir, the cosmonauts performed
more than 40 experiments involving astronomy, medicine, metallurgy
and geology. Alexandrov, 36, brought several Bulgarian-made
scientific devices.
   It was the first time a Bulgarian had boarded a Soviet space
station. An April 1979 attempt by a Soviet-Bulgarian crew to dock
their Soyuz-33 capsule with the orbiting Soviet station Salyut-6
failed, and was aborted.
   Tass said the 40-year-old Solovyov, an air force lieutenant
colonel, has been awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for
the space mission ``and for heroism and courage displayed.'' He is
also to receive the government's highest award, the Order of Lenin.

<HEAD>Democrats Hold Bologna Buffet In Bush's Houston Residence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Texas Democrats, in town for their party's
state convention, held a ``bologna buffet'' Friday in the hotel
suite that is Vice President George Bush's official state residence.
   ``It's pretty well known that George Bush moved out of Texas
some years ago and moved to Maine,'' said Ty Fain, an Austin
businessman and Democratic Party activist who rented Suite 271 at
the Houstonian Hotel and Conference Center.
   ``You can't begrudge anyone that, but sometimes politicians get
carried away with their own baloney and we can poke holes in them.
And anyone who walked through here can see this is not a home,''
Fain added.
   Fain, munching a bologna sandwich on white bread, led visitors
around the three-room suite, which rents for $515 a night, showing
off two bedrooms, each with king-size beds, and each with a small
bathroom. The suite, with floor-to-ceiling one-way glass windows,
overlooks the hotel pool, just a few feet away outside.
   ``Every man lines up in this room at the windows,'' said Elisa
Lyles, who works for Fain, as she watched men in the room gaze at
dozens of bikini-clad women tanning themselves on the pool deck.
   Fain said he called the hotel, said he was going to be in town
for a couple of days and thought it would be fun to rent the suite.
   ``I'm absolutely delighted,'' Fain said. ``This is one of the
finest hotels I've ever been in. We're just trying to have a little
fun.
   ``But the question of George Bush being a hometown boy is a
little out of date. When he comes to Texas and parades around as a
hometown boy, I think this is a little bit of baloney.''
   Bush's residency was subject of a court challenge a few years
ago but a Houston judge ruled the vice president could vote in the
city as a Texas resident.
   Bush, who has wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination,
lived in Texas for years and served as a congressman for a Houston
district. However, he has not owned a home in Texas since becoming
vice president in 1981. He was born in Massachusetts, grew up in
Connecticut and has a vacation home in Maine.

   A cold front from Nova Scotia through the mid-Atlantic Coast
into the lower Mississippi Valley brought showers and scattered
thunderstorms Friday to eastern New England and the mid-Atlantic
states.
   Showers and thunderstorms were spotty elsewhere in the nation.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, where rainfall was 7{ inches below normal
for the year, showers on Friday only brought .01 inches to the area.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in parched areas of the
Southeast, from western North Carolina into south central Alabama,
north central and northeast Texas and the central and southern Gulf
Coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in parts of eastern and
southern Nevada, southwest Utah, northern Arizona, northwest New
Mexico and central Colorado.
   Temperatures Friday afternoon were in the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation. The coolest temperatures were in the 50s and 60s in
the Pacific Northwest, the 60s from upper Michigan into northeast
Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania, and across much of New England.
   Temperatures were in the 70s from the upper Mississippi Valley
and lower Great Lakes into the central Appalachians. Temperatures
were already above 100 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   The lowest temperature for the nation Friday was 32 at
Marquette, Mich.
   The national weather forecast for Saturday includes scattered
showers and thunderstorms in the front range of the Colorado
Rockies, the lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Middle
Atlantic and southern Appalachian regions. The rest of the nation
will have mostly sunny skies.
   High temperatures will be in the 80s or 90s across much of the

   The parliament on Friday adopted a new
military oath that deletes a pledge to serve in alliance with the
Soviet army, a clause long criticized as an affront to Polish
sovereignty.
   A brief statement by the official news agency PAP said the new
oath, which was recommended by the government and the defense
ministry, was passed unanimously.
   The government has called the change merely a matter of updating
antiquated language and has said it would not affect relations with
the Soviets.
   Previously, military inductees pledged to guard peace in
``brotherly alliance with the Soviet army and other allied
armies.'' An outlawed opposition group, Freedom and Peace, had long
charged the oath affronted Polish sovereignty.
   The new oath contains no reference to the Soviet Union, and the
pledge is only to ``guard peace in the brotherhood of arms with the
allied armies.''
   It also drops a reference to defending Poland against ``the
threats of imperialism.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban has stressed that the revised
wording does not reflect any lessening of Poland's alliance with
the Soviet Union.
   ``The alliance with the Soviet Union provides the foundation for
the Polish armed forces,'' Urban said last March. ``No matter how
this truth is expressed in words, the essence of the matter will
not change.''
   Urban said the oath was changed because ``it came into existence
some time ago, so it requires some adjustments.''
   ``All periods in time have their specific styles,'' he added.
   Freedom and Peace leader Jacek Czaputowicz said many people has
been imprisoned simply for opposing the old oath. He said his group
deserved credit for the proposed change.
   ``These changes are because of the activity of Freedom and
Peace,'' he said. He called the change ``a very big success, I
think the biggest success of Freedom and Peace in its short
history.''
   He said his group hoped the new oath would be more than ``a
symbol, a one-time action, but the start of a process of changing
the role and function of the army in Polish society.''
   
   The government has denied that Freedom and Peace affected the
decision to change the oath.
   Freedom and Peace says 16 of its supporters are in prison,
either for refusing to take the oath or to comply with Poland's
mandatory two-year military draft.
   The group also demands the right to alternative national service
for conscientious objectors. The government has announced it is
considering some form of such service, but said inductees would
have to serve up to four years.
   The old oath also contained the promise to ``guard unyieldingly
the rights of the working people guaranteed in the constitution,
unyieldingly stand guard of the people's rule and remain faithful
to the government of the Polish People's Republic.''
   The new oath says simply: ``I swear to serve the homeland and
the nation,'' with no specific reference to the government or
working people.
   Czaputowicz said it was significant that the references to
socialism and the government were dropped.
   ``Some people from Freedom and Peace who refused to take the
oath said they cannot swear to the government because this
government is not our government,'' he said. ``It is not the
government of the whole nation.''
   Five Freedom and Peace supporters from Gdansk were detained
outside Parliament on Thursday, 15 minutes after they sat down on
the pavement to demand passage of the new oath, Czaputowicz said.
   The protesters were also calling for release of Freedom and
Peace member Slawomir Dutkiewicz, 24, of Szczecin, who was
imprisoned for resisting the draft.
   Dutkiewicz has been force-fed since he began a hunger strike in
November. He has lost 44 pounds and his health has deteriorated
significantly, according to Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, a physician who
examined him in prison earlier this week.

<HEAD>Mixed Verdict Emerging in Special Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEEMA SIROHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partial results were announced Friday in
special elections to fill seven vacancies in Parliament and 11 in
state assemblies, and political commentators on state-run
television called it a mixed verdict.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party won five state
assembly seats and one in the federal Parliament in Thursday's
balloting. Various opposition parties claimed two seats in
Parliament and four assembly seats.
   In the key contest, still outstanding, former Defense Minister
V.P. Singh was reported leading by more than 9,000 votes over
Congress Party candidate Sunil Shastri for Parliament, with about
35,000 votes counted.
   The Allahabad district involved has 850,000 registered voters.
Final results there were not expected before Saturday following
allegations by Singh supporters o ballot-stuffing and intimidation
of voters by the Congress Party.
   A Congress Party spokesman denied the allegations.
   Singh, a onetime Gandhi ally now turned foe, is being trumpeted
by the opposition as an alternative to Gandhi for prime minister.
Full elections for Parliament must be held by January 1990.
   The six states in which elections were held were Allahabad, West
Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. Among the
opposition parties contesting the Congress Party were the Lok Dal,
Janata and Indian People's parties, as well as alliances.
   The Congress Party won five assembly seats in four different
states, the United News of India reported.
   It ran strongly in the desert state of Rajasthan, which has been
gripped by a severe drought this year, but lost its parliamentary
seat in Pali, in the Hindi heartland of Haryana.
   In Gujarat state, the Janata Party claimed the Godhra seat.
   Counting was postponed in two contests in opposition-ruled
Haryana state after Congress Party workers were attacked and
injured, the TV reported.
   But national attention remained focused on Allahabad, the
prestigious constituency of former prime ministers and the hometown
of the Gandhi family.
   The contest there has become a new test for Gandhi's popularity,
currently on the decline with charges of corruption against his
government.
   Singh resigned from Gandhi's Cabinet last year, saying the
government was not moving fast enough to investigate alleged
kickbacks in defense contracts.
   Singh campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, promising to
provide a ``clean'' alternative to the present government.

   Communist guards arrested two East Germans who
were running toward the Berlin Wall on Friday, the 35th anniversary
of the failed East German workers' uprising that was put down by
Soviet soldiers and tanks.
   The day is a national holiday in West Germany, with most
businesses and offices closed, but there are no East German
commemorations of the revolt.
   West Berlin police said eight communist border guards arrested
the two men as they tried to reach the heavily fortified wall that
divides the city.
   Witnesses said they heard the men shout ``Go on shoot, you
pigs!'' to the pursuing guards early Friday.
   On June 17, 1953, thousands of workers in East Berlin staged
strikes and demonstrations demanding free elections, the removal of
the communist government and better living conditions.
   Late Thursday night, about 2,000 East German youths gathered
near the wall to listen to a concert by British rock group Pink
Floyd being staged on the West Berlin side of the concrete barrier.
   Many shouted, ``The wall must go!''
   East German security forces were deployed througout the area
near the Brandenburg Gate and about 20 people were arrested, West
Berlin police said.
   After the concert, police said at least six firebombs were
hurled by West German youths at the wall as concert fans in West
Berlin dispersed.
   West German officials marked the June 17 uprising anniversary by
calling on the East German government to improve its human rights
performance.

   Iraq said Friday its forces shot down an
Iranian helicopter during battles on the mountainous northern
border. An Iranian leader criticized a proposed U.S. arms sale to
Kuwait.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian parliament and new
appointed commander of the armed forces, said the proposed $1.9
billion sale of U.S. aircraft and missiles to Kuwait was
``arrogant.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Thursday it would be
``a political breakthrough'' for Kuwait to tie itself to U.S.
technology and handle its own defense.
   U.S. warships now protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian
Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
The tankers, half the Kuwaiti fleet, have been given American flags
and registration.
   Rafsanjani said Iran had achieved its goal in the drive launched
Monday toward Basra, Iraq's southern provincial capital, which he
said was to ``destroy the Iraqi forces in the Salamcheh area'' near
the border city.
   Iran gave no reports on fighting Friday but Iraq said its
helicopter gunships flew 295 combat sorties, the largest number
this week and an indication of heavy ground fighting.
   Dispatches from the official Iraqi News Agency said ground
forces in the northern sector shot down an Iranian helicopter and
fighting has heavy on the peaks surrounding the Ahmed Romi mountain
recaptured a day earlier.
   Iraqi reports said the town of Mawet was captured in a battle
that began Wednesday. Iranian forces took both town and mountain
last summer.
   Ahmed Romi, more than 6,500 feet high, overlooks an entire
valley and is about 25 miles northeast of Sulimaniyah, Iraq's
largest northern city and provincial capital of the Kurdish region.
The mountain is just over four miles from the border.
   In other developments Friday:
   _Richard Murphy, special U.S. envoy to the region, was in Saudi
Arabia at the start of an eight-nation tour to discuss both the
Iran-Iraq war and the Arab-Israeli conflict, diplomatic sources
reported.
   _Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. secretary-general, said he was in
weekly contact with officials of Iraq and Iran and had not
abandoned the attempt to end the war. He spoke to reporters after
briefing the Security Council on his latest efforts.
   _Saudi Arabia said it has not barred Iranian pilgrims from the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina next month, and warned Iran
against trying to foment trouble by proxy. Iran's supervisor of
pilgrims, Mehdi Karrubi, said Wednesday no Iranians would make the
pilgrimage because the Saudis had ``created obstacles.''

   Two black policemen on Friday
were sentenced to hang for hiring an assassin to kill a woman who
charged them with torturing her during interrogation.
   Naftan Mchunu, the gunman who committed the murder, also was
sentenced to die by the Supreme Court in Pietermaritzburg, capital
of Natal Province.
   Police earlier reported that Thursday's anniversary of the 1976
Soweto black uprising passed with five injuries but no deaths in
township unrest. Black newspapers called for the day to be declared
an official holiday.
   The two black officers, Jabulani Zondi and Mphikwa Ndela, were
convicted of hiring the assassin to shoot Minah Ngcobo, a woman
they assaulted during an investigation in Natal.
   According to testimony at the trial, Miss Ngcobo filed charges
of attempted murder against the policemen after they put rubber
tubing over her face and ducked her head in a river during
interrogation.
   After the charges were filed, the officers hired Mchunu to
commit what Judge P.M. Nienaber called a ``cold-blooded, brutal and
self-serving execution.''
   Four other policemen, all white, have received the death penalty
in the past three months in two separate murder cases.
   Police in Pretoria reported about two dozen disturbances and 52
arrests in townships across the country Thursday as blacks marked
Soweto Day.
   The day, which has become an unofficial black holiday,
commemorates a 1976 protest during which police fired at students,
setting off months of nationwide rioting that left hundreds of
blacks dead.
   Most of the incidents Thursday involved firebombings or stonings
of vehicles. In several cases, police used tear gas or fired
gunshots to disperse crowds. Hundreds of thousands of blacks stayed
home from work.
   A suspected guerrilla from the outlawed African National
Congress was killed in Cape Town when explosives he was carrying
accidentally went off, police said.
   Two leading black newspapers, The Sowetan and City Press, noted
Soweto Day was observed with dignity by most blacks and called on
the government to declare June 16 an official holiday.
   At present, there are no official holidays of special
significance to the 26 million black majority in South Africa.
   The government intensified its monitoring of foreign journalists
by asking officials to report all interview requests from foreign
reporters and to rebuff those not accredited by the government.
   The Bureau of Information outlined the new policy in a letter
circulated to government departments, The Weekly Mail reported
Friday.
   The bureau confirmed existence of the letter, which also asked
officials to report all interview requests from accredited foreign
journalists ``so that you can be informed of the attitude of the
particular journalist and the media he represents, and the
activities of foreign journalists can be monitored more
efficiently.''
   Bureau director Dave Steward said the new procedure was aimed at
protecting unsuspecting officials from journalists who enter South
Africa ``under false pretenses with a view to produce one-sided and
vitriolic propaganda against South Africa.''
   A week ago, the government imposed new state-of-emergency press
restrictions on reporting anti-government activity.
   Regulations already in effect restrict reporting on security
force activity, unrest, various types of peaceful protest and a
range of ``subversive statements.''
   Also on Friday, the black metalworkers union called off a strike
at the Mercedes-Benz plant in East London and agreed to arbitration
following management's threat to fire the strikers.
   From 300 to 400 black workers had been on strike since June 9,
mainly over dismissals. The factory employs nearly 4,000 workers.

   The cost of dollars and food soared,
taxi drivers quadrupled fares and two unions demanded pay raises of
600 percent Friday, two days after the leftist Sandinista
government introduced free-market measures.
   Among actions taken were a huge devaluation of the cordoba,
Nicaragua's currency, a near-doubling of gasoline prices and a
general pay increase of 30 percent.
   The government retained subsidies on some basic foods. But in
markets where goods sell outside the rationing system at
free-market rates, the price of a liter of milk, just over a quart,
had gone from 6.6 to 21 cordobas; meat from 50 to 100 cordobas a
pound, and a dozen eggs from 50 to 80 cordobas.
   A dollar was worth 80 cordobas instead of the former 13 at the
official rate. On the black market Friday, a dollar bought 250
cordobas, 90 more than the market offered before devaluation.
   The transporation system was in disarray because of the new
gasoline prices. Cab drivers ignored the official tariff of 5
cordobas for a short trip, demanding 20, and many who own their
taxis simply stayed home.
   Two major unions controlled by the Socialist Party demanded
raises of 600 percent. The government called the positions of the
Workers' Federation of Nicaragua and General Federation of
Independent Workers ``unreal'' and inflationary.
   Primary school teachers earn about 2,500 cordobas a month and
their guild says that is not enough to live on. President Daniel
Ortega said he would meet with the teachers Sunday.
   So far, no public protests of the economic measures have been
held.
   Ortega told domestic critics Thursday they were ``playing with
fire'' by opposing the program and the political opposition might
``disappear if they don't respond with the patriotism our country
demands.''

   Police detained at least 11 people in
Prague on Friday and prevented peace activists from Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, the United States and other nations from holding a
seminar, emigre sources said.
   The Independent Peace Seminar was organized by the Czechoslovak
human rights group Charter 77 and was scheduled to begin Friday
with three workshops, said Palach Press, an emigre publishing house
based in London.
   It said police raided one of the meetings at 3 p.m. and detained
11 people, including Petr Uhl and Jiri Pavlicek, the two main
organizers of the seminar.
   Others arrested included Libuse Silhanova, Jozef Vohrizek and
Jan Litomisky, the three Charter 77 spokesmen, Palach Press said.
   Emigre sources in Vienna, speaking privately, said the meeting
was held in the apartment of Jiri Dienstbier, who also was detained.
   They said an American, not identified, was among those taken
away. The sources said he was told to leave the country.
   Palach Press reported that police interrupted the second meeting
after about two hours, photographed the participants and detained
at least nine people, including former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek
and a Hungarian named Ferenc Misliwetz, Hajek is a Charter 77
signatory.
   The Vienna sources said police took about 40 people away from
that meeting, but that it was not clear whether the people were
arrested or just escorted out in order to stop the meeting. They
said no information was available on the third workshop, which was
held in an apartment without a telephone.
   In a related development, a Czechoslovak activist who published
underground religious and other literature was convicted Friday of
subversive activity and sentenced to four years in prison, an
emigre source in Vienna reported.
   He said Ivan Polansky, 52, was sentenced by the district court
of Banska Bystrica in Slovakia.

   Two bandits, one wearing a cowboy
hat, stopped an armored truck and escaped with about $2 million
worth of gold, platinum and uncut diamonds, police reported Friday.
   They said the robbers struck just before midnight Thursday near
the Frankfurt airport and gave this account:
   The gunmen used a stolen car to block the route of the armored
truck. When the truck driver tried to swerve around the car, one
robber jumped onto the van, aimed a pistol at the two men inside
and ordered them to stop.
   The two robbers tied up the armored truck employees, loaded the
loot into the car and drove away. The driver and his assistant
called officials after freeing themselves.
   Police declined to say who owned the precious metal and diamonds
or give further information about the robbery.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Pat Swindall apologized Friday for
considering a proposal to finance a $1 million home with laundered
drug and gambling money, saying he was wrong and ashamed but will
still run for re-election.
   The Republican congressman said his political future should be
left up to the voters of Georgia's 4th District, in Atlanta's
eastern suburbs.
   ``I was wrong to have ever considered such a proposal, to have
discussed, it,'' Swindall said. ``I was wrong not to have gone to
the authorities before I did.''
   He said, however, that he ``made the right decision'' in walking
away from the deal before he got in too deep.
   ``I do know the difference between right and wrong,'' Swindall
said at a news conference. ``I did not break the law nor do
anything unethical.''
   Swindall, who appeared to choke back tears while making his
opening statement, apologized to his supporters and family for
making them ``bear this burden.''
   Swindall said he would continue his campaign for re-election
because ``there is not another candidate who will reflect the
majority view of this district in Congress.''
   He said he had no ill will for the federal investigators
``because I think what they were doing is exactly what they should
be doing.''
   ``I think the drug situation in this country is such that we
need sting operations,'' he said.
   The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution reported
Thursday that transcripts of tapes made secretly by federal
authorities show Swindall was told money he was seeking to borrow
for a home in Stone Mountain might be illegal drug or gambling
profits.
   The tapes were made by Internal Revenue Service agent Michael
Mullaney. Mullaney, posing as a money broker for underworld
figures, was investigating Charles LeChasney when the Atlanta
businessman brought in Swindall to negotiate an $850,000 loan.
   LeChasney was indicted in February on federal money laundering
charges.
   Swindall said he did receive a $150,000 check at one point, but
he returned it uncashed. He said he terminated all dealings with
LeChasney when he began to suspect the money was tainted.
   ``A U.S. congressman ought to be totally above reproach,'' he
said. ``I wasn't above reproach. I will say that I have never been
as ashamed about anything as I am ashamed about what I have done.''
   Georgia Democratic Party Chairman John Henry Anderson sent Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a letter of complaint against Swindall,
asking Gingrich to sign it and forward it to the House ethics
committee.
   Gingrich, who filed a complaint that has led to an ethics probe
of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said Thursday he would look
into a possible investigation.
   Swindall, at his news conference, said he would welcome such an
investigation as well as any other probe.
   ``I think I am subject to every investigation that can be
conceived by the human mind. When I make mistakes, I will confess
them and say this was a mistake,'' he said.
   Earlier Friday, Guy Davis, an Atlanta lawyer who was the Georgia
Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1986, said he met with
LeChasney in jail early this year and was warned Swindall would be
politically damaged by the laundering investigation.
   State party leaders heard the warning and rejected suggestions
that they get another candidate into the race for Swindall's seat,
said two participants in the discussions, Davis and Rich
Richardson, an Atlanta businessman and past financial contributor
to Swindall.
   ``Some believed that Pat was such a Mr. Clean guy that he'd come
out of it,'' Richardson recalled.
   Because the qualifying period has ended, no name other than
Swindall's can appear on the Republican primary ballot.
   Write-in votes are not allowed in the Aug. 9 primary, so any
Republican other than Swindall wishing to run would have to wage a
write-in campaign in November against the winner of the three-way
Democratic primary, said Lee Raudonis, executive director of the
Georgia Republican Party.

<TEXT>
   The parliament on Friday have staged an
unprecedented rebellion against the ruling Communist Party
leadership, refusing to unseat an officeholder to create a vacancy
for a former Politburo member.
   Also Friday, Deputy Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski was
appointed foreign minister to succeed Marian Orzechowski, who
assumed new Communist Party responsibilities earlier in the week.
   As foreign minister since 1985, Orzechowski saw Poland through a
period of improved relations with Western countries. Such relations
deteriorated following the 1981 military crackdown on the
independent Solidarity trade union movement.
   On the legislators' action, one deputy said it was the first
time the Sejm, or parliament, had turned down such a motion from
the party.
   ``I think it was a kind of warning addressed to the state
leadership that the old methods are not going to be effective and
not going to be tolerated,'' said Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, a Sejm
deputy and member of the Communist-allied United Peasant Party.
   The vote came the same day parliament passed unanimously a new
military oath that deleted a pledge to serve alongside the Soviet
army. The old pledge had been seen by some as an affront to Polish
sovereignty.
   Polish government officials have said the change was only an
updating of antiquated language and did not reflect a lessening of
the alliance with the Soviet Union.
   The parliament revolt came on a motion to remove Gen. Tadeusz
Hupalowski as head of the Supreme Chamber of Control, a post
similar to auditor general, to make room for Wlodzimierz
Mokryszczak, who left the Politburo of the Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party on Tuesday in a leadership reshuffle.
   Only 154 deputies, less than a majority of the 460-member Sejm,
voted in favor of removing Hupalowski, with 140 voting against and
40 abstaining. The motion was defeated.
   State radio initially announced Hupalowski had been removed and
Mokryszczak would replace him, but later corrected the report.
   A spokesman for the government press office said Friday night
there would be no immediate comment on the matter.
   Deputy Kozakiewicz said Hupalowski had been doing a good job and
most deputies felt his removal would harm parliament. He said the
proposed replacement ``didn't arouse such enthusiasm.''
   Increasing the power and independence of the Sejm has been one
of Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's aims in his program of
political reforms. But because the Communist Party dominates the
Sejm and the government, party dictates in the past have been
treated as law.
   Some deputies complained openly when they were instructed to
approve ministerial appointments with only a few hours to review
nominees during a government shake-up last year.
   Kozakiewicz said the parliament action Friday was ``important
proof that something is going on in the Sejm, that something is
changing, that some kind of mechanisms are at work.''
   Of the 460 deputies in the Sejm, 245 are Communists, 106 are
members of the United Peasant Party, 35 are members of the
Democratic Party and 74 are non-party members.
   The constitution says the Communist Party has the ``leading
role,'' and its leadership is recognized by the other two parties.

   English and German soccer fans
went on rampages in Frankfurt and Munich Friday, and police said
the body of an Irishman was recovered from the River Main.
   They said the man apparently fell into the river while drunk and
he was not the victim of violence.
   English fans, on a self-proclaimed ``Invasion of Germany 1988,''
descended on Frankfurt from Duesseldorf for Saturday's match
between Britain and the Soviet Union in the European Soccer
Championship.
   Groups of rowdies smashed windows, overturned cars and hurled
beer bottles in a rampage through the streets early Friday.
   Small bands of English, West German and Italian hoodlums
scuffled Friday night near Frankfurt's main railroad station where
about 200 beer-drinking English fans had been milling about since
the afternoon, police reported.
   At one point police dispersed a group of dozens of Britons and
arrested three people, according to police.
   ``They (the English) came out of the bar looking for trouble and
they got it,'' said Peter Staskiewecz, a Frankfurt police spokesman.
   He said the English fans were marching down a street shouting
and singing when the police charged.
   In Munich, where West Germany defeated Spain 2-0 in a match,
police reported 59 arrests and said most of those jailed were
Germans but at least one was an Englishman. They also said 61
``skinheads,'' young men who shave their heads as part of a gang
cult, were rounded up to prevent violence but were not charged.
   Munich police said some of those arrested were accused of
damaging several cars in the train that took them to the Bavarian
capital.
   Several people, including three police officers, were slightly
injured in the violence early Friday in Frankrurt.
   This year's two-week soccer championships, which began June 10,
have led to some of the most elaborate police and security
preparations in several years in West Germany.
   The English fans already have left behind a string of arrests in
Stuttgart, Cologne and Duesseldorf. In Duesseldorf, police say West
German thugs sparked the violence by attacking the English.
   The violence already has prompted England to withdraw its
application for readmission to European club soccer tournaments
next season.
   English clubs were banned after the 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy
in which 39 people, most of them Italians, were killed in violence
sparked by English soccer fans.
   In preparation for Saturday's match, Frankfurt police put 1,400
officers on alert in Frankfurt, and special squads patrolled the
city.
   The expected troubles already have led many tavern owners to
announce they will close early over the weekend.
   ``This is a soccer-free area,'' said a sign taped up in one bar
window by an owner trying to keep drunken fans away.
   Early Friday, fans smashed up bars and brawled with German
tavern patrons in Frankfurt's Sachsenhausen district and near the
main railroad station.
   ``There were at least 60 English fans involved, and they had
split up into groups,'' Frankfurt police spokesman Karl-Heinz
Wagner told The Associated Press.
   The rowdies also overturned cars, hurled beer bottles at
passers-by and smashed store windows, Wagner said. Ten English
soccer fans and a West German were arrested, he said.
   Later Friday, police said the body of a 29-year-old Irish soccer
fan was found floating in the Main River running through Frankfurt.
   Police said there was no immediate indication of foul play and
that the victim apparently drowned while intoxicated. Wagner said
the body was discovered Thursday night.
   In Duesseldorf, police spokesman Wolfgang Rodax said that two
days of violence among soccer fans there led to 371 arrests. Of
those, 18 were English and most of the others West German.
   ``Neither before nor after the game were the English the ones
who started the street battles, fights and brawls,'' said Rodax.
   Rodax accused West German thugs of starting the disturbances
Tuesday and Wednesday as the Dutch beat the English 3-1.

   Gen. Cesar Barrientos, minister of the

died Friday, the government announced. He was 82.
   The cause of death was not reported but Barrientos had not
appeared in public since late last year and had received medical
treatment in recent months in Argentina.
   Barrientos was an army administrative officer when Stroessner
came to power and appointed him to the treasury post.
   Stroessner, 75, recently was elected to an 8th consecutive term

   Authorities discovered a Red Brigades
terrorist hideout, arrested nine people and seized a submachine gun
possibly used to kill a former U.S. diplomat, police said Friday.
   Warrants issued by a prosecutor in Milan accused the nine people
of participating in an armed band and of illegally possessing
weapons, said Col. Luigi Nobili, commander of Milan's carabinieri
police.
   A police anti-terrorist squad discovered the hideout Thursday in
a Milan apartment after a two-year investigation of a group
suspected of trying to rebuild Italy's left-wing terrorism network,
Nobili told a news conference Friday.
   The Red Brigades terrorized Italy in the 1970s with kidnappings
and assassinations, including the murder of former Prime Minister
Aldo Moro in 1978.
   Nobili said officers found two machine guns and a submachine
gun, ammunition, 60 million lire ($46,000) and documents related to
killings claimed by the Red Brigades and a related group, the
Fighting Communists.
   He said investigators believed the submachine gun may have been
used to kill American Leaman R. Hunt, director-general of the
Multinational Force and Observers. The Rome-based group monitored
the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in the Sinai Peninsula.
   Hunt, a career diplomat, was assassinated in Rome in February
1984.
   The submachine gun may also have been used in the murders of
Sen. Roberto Ruffilli, economist Ezio Tarantelli and former
Florence Mayor Lando Conti, Nobili said.
   The Red Brigades claimed responsibility for killing the three
Italians, while the Fighting Communists said they killed Hunt.
   Ballistics experts were checking the submachine gun, police said.
   Ruffilli, a Christian Democrat and close friend and adviser of
Premier Ciriaco De Mita, was killed last April at his apartment in
Forli, a small town near Bologna.
   Tarantelli, who was shot and killed in Rome in March 1985, was a
leading official of the Christian Democrat-dominated labor union
CISL and had been a member of the government commission that
drafted a plan to reduce Italian workers' automatic wage increases.
   Conti, who was killed in February 1986 in Florence, was a
consultant for a company that produced radar and other military
electronic equipment. He had been accused in left-wing pamphlets of
``exporting war.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities captured one prison escapee
and searched for seven others by plane, boat, car and foot Friday,
and a prosecutor who sent one of the men to prison for murder was
given extra protection.
   Robert G. Sherman, was caught 15 minutes after he was sighted on
Interstate 24, about a mile from the maximum-security prison, said
corrections Capt. Billy Adams. Authorities said they spotted
another escapee in the same vicinity, but lost him after a short
chase.
   A lockdown at the century-old Kentucky State Penitiary entered a
second day, with the prison's approximately 770 inmates kept in
their cells except for meals.
   Authorites in North Carolina, meanwhile, on Friday captured the
third of six detainees who escaped a county jail.
   In the Kentucky prison break early Thursday, the escapees sawed
open their cell doors and cut through a prison window, then climbed
down an extension cord 30 feet to the ground. Guards had been
diverted by fires set elsewhere in the prison.
   Authorities found a 2- to 3-inch piece of a hacksaw in one of
the escapee's cells, prison spokesman Bobby Waller said Friday.
   In Louisville, 200 miles northeast of the prison, extra security
was put into effect for Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney
Ernest Jasmin, said an assistant, John W. Stewart. Jasmin
prosecuted Leo C. Spurling, 30, for murder and sent him to prison
for life.
   Jasmin first declined the offer of protection but later
accepted, Stewart said. Stewart declined to give details of
Jasmin's protection. It was ``nothing to suggest we're afraid, but
better safe than sorry,'' he said.
   The successful jailbreak by the eight inmates, four of them
convicted murderers, was the largest in state history. Nine other
inmates also tried to flee, authorities said.
   The penitentiary, five miles east of Eddyville on Lake Barkley,
is surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by woods,
but no wall or fence enclosed the cellblock from which the eight
fled.
   Waller said a boat, two police small airplanes, 20 troopers, a
dog team, local authorities and 60 prison officers were combing the
area. Guards with shotguns searched all vehicles leaving the
facility.
   Sherman told authorities he had gone off by himself after the
escape, then hid and did not move until Thursday night, Warden
William Seabold said, adding that Sherman appeared embarrassed when
told he was the first escapee caught.
   Sherman, 30, of Lilly, arrived back at the prison at 4:35,
shirtless and with his heavily tatooed back full of scratches. He
had been serving 15 years for robbery, escape, wanton endangerment
and promoting contraband.
   At least some of the inmates were thought to have fled in a
pickup truck stolen before dawn Thursday a quarter-mile from the
prison. State police investigated a reported sighting of the
vehicle Thursday night, but found nothing.
   In the North Carolina escape from the Cumberland County Jail,
authorities said Gregory Maurice Lee, 30, who had been serving time
for first-degree burglary, larceny and assault on a female,
surrendered to police in Fayetteville.
   ``The next time, I will get out of town,'' he told police. ``I
was too busy running.''
   Six people sawed through jail bars and dropped from a rope made
of sheets to escape from the jail Sunday night; one was captured
immediately, the second on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A woman who claimed to be the wife of talk
show host David Letterman after allegedly breaking into his home
and taking his car is incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled
Friday.
   The ruling by Superior Court Judge James Bingham came after
testimony from a doctor that 36-year-old Margaret Ray is ``rambling
and has impaired judgment.''
   Bingham ordered that Ms. Ray be taken to a psychiatric hospital
and examined by a team of doctors. Meanwhile, he ruled that she was
not mentally able to stand trial because, ``she is able to
understand the charges against her, but she is unable to assist in
her own defense.''
   ``She was rambling, exhibited flight of ideas and was
delusional,'' the doctor, James Alexander of Bridgeport, said of
his 45-minute examination. ``She feels there is a power of some
kind controlling her behavior.''
   Ms. Ray testified that she was simply ``cold, tired and hungry''
from her jail stay.
   Ms. Ray has been jailed under $25,000 bond since her arrest May
22, when police said she was stopped driving Letterman's 1988
Porsche and tried to pass herself off as his wife. Police said they
later discovered Letterman's New Canaan home had been broken into
and it appeared someone had been living there for several days.
   Letterman, the host of ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' has
said he does not know Ms. Ray.
   Letterman declined to press charges following the first
incident. But Ms. Ray, who police say has no known address, was
arrested after she returned to Letterman's house a few days later.
   Police said that she was eating and writing what she decribed as
scripts for Letterman's show when police found her in his living
room during the second incident.
   She has been charged with two counts of second-degree burglary
and one court of first-degree larceny.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis insists an investigation of House
Speaker Jim Wright will not affect his presidential bid, but
Republicans who think otherwise are looking forward to pressing the
issue during what should be Dukakis' shining moment _ the
Democratic National Convention.
   Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, wasted few
opportunities during the primary season to lambaste malfeasance in
the Reagan administration, delivering particularly harsh criticism
of embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Now Republicans, who successfully sought a House ethics
investigation of Wright's conduct, are firing back and trying to
neutralize the so-called GOP ``sleaze factor'' with attacks on the
nation's highest-ranking elected Democrat.
   Wright is chairman of the national convention in Atlanta and as
such will attract lots of national television time during the
three-day gathering.
   An embarrassment for Dukakis?
   ``I thought there was a presumption of innocence in this
country,'' was his reply when asked Thursday.
   That may be true in the courts; perhaps not in politics.
   ``In a politically charged atmosphere, it's going to take on a
life of its own,'' said Bob Beckel, who managed Walter F. Mondale's
1984 presidential campaign. ``The reality is that the Republicans
are going to make every bit of political hay out of this _ and they
should.''
   When the Democrats huddle next month to crown Dukakis as their
nominee and to set the tone for the campaign against Republican
George Bush, there will be plenty of GOP strategists on hand to
offer their perspective to the news media.
   Wright will be in the limelight _ and under the spotlight.
   ``He will be up there at the podium longer than Michael Dukakis
or anyone else, for all to see, and that is an embarrassment,''
said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute.
   ``And every night we'll have (national GOP chairman) Frank
Fahrenkopf on television talking about the Democrats and their
`sleaze factor,''' said Schneider. ``Imagine if Ed Meese was
running the Republican convention.''
   Dukakis aides say there have been no attempts to reduce Wright's
visibility at the convention.
   ``The governor has talked to Speaker Wright and the speaker
assured him that this will move expeditiously and that the outcome
will be fine,'' said Chuck Campion, Dukakis' national political
director. ``We see no ramifications at all.''
   There may also be an independent investigation of allegations
Wright lobbied improperly on behalf of oil companies with which he
may have had financial relationships, questions surrounding
publication of a book for which he received a higher-than-usual
royalty and which was produced with the help of a congressionally
paid staffer, contacts with federal officials on behalf of Texas
savings and loans and the use of a condominium for which he paid no
monthly rent.
   Dukakis maintains the speaker's troubles are not comparable to
those of Meese or others in the Reagan administration who have been
convicted of or accused of wrongdoing _ pointing to Wright's
cooperation while saying many in the administration have tried to
stonewall investigators.
   And he sees no inconsistency in his demand that Meese resign
while he is making no such request of Wright.
   ``If you're attorney general of this country and you've stumbled
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided
as weak leadership as he has, you ought to leave office,'' Dukakis
said.
   He insists otherwise, but the allegations against Wright must
trouble Dukakis, who built his reputation as a good-government
reformer by challenging entrenched Boston pols who openly relished
their power.
   ``It must irritate him wildly to see this thing happening to
Democratic leaders,'' said Schneider. ``One gets the impression
that he'd like to fire Jim Wright. This is just the type of thing
that drives Michael Dukakis crazy. He wants to keep a thousand
miles away from anything that associates him with the sleaze
factor.''
   That won't be possible.
   In addition to the convention, Dukakis might also run into
Wright this weekend at the Texas Democratic Convention. Dukakis
aides said they were not sure if the two would hold a private
meeting there.
   At the convention in Houston on Friday night, Wright drew a
standing ovation from delegates. He made no mention of the ethics
probe during a keynote speech, but ex-Gov. Mark White, who
introduced Wright, called on Republicans who levied the allegations
at Wright to ``clean up your own house before you slander the name
of Jim Wright.''
   Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said the allegations of
financial improprieties are based on party politics, saying, ``What
is really bothering the Republicans about Jim Wright is he is the
most effective speaker since Sam Rayburn died.''
   Dukakis was quick to criticize Meese when questioned Thursday.
But attacks on the attorney general were missing from Dukakis'
rhetoric during three Massachusetts events this week designed to
portray him as a tough crimefighter _ seemingly the perfect type of
forum to criticize the nation's top law enforcement officer.
   ``I think it's wise for him to do that now,'' said Schneider.
``What he has to do is talk about the yard-long list of indictments
and convictions in this administration, not just Ed Meese.''
   Beckel said the greatest test is how Dukakis handles himself at
the convention.
   ``Dukakis should keep his distance from Wright but not abandon
him,'' Beckel said. ``He's got enough to worry about right now. For
Dukakis, it's like walking into a mine field.''

   A Colombian alleged to be among the world's major
cocaine traffickers was indicted with five other people Friday in
an alleged attempt to establish a cocaine distribution center in
Colorado.
   The five-count indictment handed down in U.S. District Court
here alleges that Pablo Emilio Escobar-Gaviria, a principal in the
Medellin cartel of Colombian cocaine traffickers, and five others
planned to ship up to 800 kilograms of cocaine a week into the
Denver area.
   Authorities, who arrested four of the defendants and seized 738
pounds of cocaine in a May 25 motel raid, estimated that 800 kilos
of cocaine could have a street value of as much as $17 million.
   The indictment accuses the men of importing the cocaine with the
intent of distributing it in the United States.
   Escobar, 39, also is under indictment in the Southern District
of Florida, on charges of conspiracy to import and distribute
drugs, said U.S. Attorney Michael J. Norton.
   ``Escobar-Gaviria is considered by some to be one of the major
cocaine traffickers in the world,'' Norton said.
   Escobar-Gaviria and another man named in the indictment remain
at large. Four others named in the indictment were arrested May 25
at a motel in Boulder by agents of the FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration and accused of trying to smuggle 335 kilograms _ or
about 738 pounds _ of cocaine into Colorado.
   ``The drug cartel told our informants that increased federal law
enforcement efforts in south Florida, south Texas and Southern
California had made them seek new distribution centers in the
U.S.,'' Norton said.
   Members of the cartel also complained that increased efforts by
law enforcement authorities in Colombia were hurting the cartel's
drug operations, Norton said.
   Norton said a three-month DEA investigation disrupted plans to
fly the cocaine from Colombia to Colorado for further distribution
in California and Florida ``as well as the fertile Rocky Mountain
area.''
   The cocaine would have been flown by a private twin-engine plane
into Jefferson County Airport at Broomfield, about 18 miles
northwest of Denver, Norton said.

<TEXT>
   Street vendor-poet Dennis Lobban was
found guilty Friday and sentenced to hang for the murder of reggae
star Peter Tosh and two of his friends.
   A jury of eight women and four men took six minutes to convict
Lobban on three counts of murder.
   ``I am innocent, sir,'' Lobban answered when Justice Carl
Patterson asked if he had anything to say before sentencing him to
hang on each count.
   The judge told the jury: ``I would have arrived at the same
verdict. I have no doubt in my mind that he went there (to Tosh's
home) that night and killed Tosh and the others.
   ``It was just by chance that the other four (visitors at the
house) survived or we would have had seven people lying dead.''
   Lobban, 33, a convicted felon with a long police record, was out
on parole when the murders were committed.
   He insisted throughout the trial that he was innocent. He
claimed he was drinking with friends far from Tosh's house the
night of Sept. 11, 1987, when Tosh, radio disc jockey Jeff Dixon
and Wilton ``Doc'' Brown were murdered by three gunmen who burst
into Tosh's home.
   The trial began Monday and had been expected to last for weeks.
   Like all trials in Jamaica involving illegal firearms, it was
held behind closed doors in the Gun Court Division of Home Circuit
Court. Reporters were allowed into the courtroom on condition they
not publish the names of witnesses.
   Steve Russell, 26, of Kingston, who had been charged jointly
with Lobban, was freed on Thursday. The judge accepted a no-case
motion from Russell's lawyer, who said the prosecution failed to
show Russell was involved in the slayings.
   Russell claimed he only drove the killers to Tosh's home without
going inside or knowing they were going to kill Tosh.
   Lobban, who turned 33 on Thursday, is a ``higgler,'' or street
vendor, and a ``dub poet,'' who recites poetry to reggae music.
   He has been convicted of eight previous felons, ranging from
illegal possession of firearms to armed robbery.
   Lobban was escorted from court by armed guards and taken to
prison to join 188 other people on death row.
   Any appeal would go to the Jamaican Court of Appeal. The final
court of appeal is the Privy Council in England.
   Tosh, 42 years old at the time of his death, was nominated for a
Grammy in 1985 for his album, ``Captured Live.''
   Tosh, Bob Marley and Neville Livingstone in 1963 formed the
group The Wailers, which thrust reggae's driving rhythms from the
slums of Kingston onto the world stage.
   Born Winston Herbert MacIntosh, Tosh left The Wailers in 1973.
One later Tosh group was Word, Sound and Power.
   Outside Jamaica, Tosh was perhaps best known for his
collaboration with Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger on the
Smokey Robinson song, ``(You Got To) Walk and Don't Look Back.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat fired the
commander in chief of the Haitian army and two other generals
Friday night, accusing them of insubordination.
   National television read a communique stating that Manigat had
retired Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the commander, and two other members
of the general staff, brigadier generals Carl Michel Nicolas and
Wilton Cherisson.
   Col. Morton Gousse was promoted to brigadier general and named
acting commander in chief until the Senate names a new one, the
communique said.
   The president overruled Namphy on Wednesday by rescinding an
order issued the previous day transferring and retiring
high-ranking officers. Manigat said the order was unconsitutional
because it was done without consulting him.
   Manigat, alleged to be the army's candidate in junta-run
elections last January, has maintained that he rules independently.
   Namphy's order had included the transfer of Col. Jean-Claude
Paul, commander of the largest unit in Haiti's 6,000-man army, who
was indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal grand jury in
Florida earlier this year.
   The constitution names the president as ``nominal'' commander in
chief of the armed forces and the head of the army as ``effective''
commander in chief.
   Manigat took over on Feb. 7 from Namphy as Haiti's chief
executive. Namphy had been president of a ruling junta for exactly
two years after President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile in France.
   Manigat met for four hours Wednesday with the army general
staff, headed by Namphy, and obtained a statement from the general
staff pledging allegiance to Manigat's civilian government and
``tentatively'' accepting Manigat's decision to overrule Namphy,
according to local news reports.
   Manigat's decree said that despite their pledge on Wednesday,
Namphy and other members of the general staff ``began to execute
the order'' retiring and transferring officers.
   It said their action ``is a sort of insubordination ... toward
the constitutional commander in chief (the president).''
   The communique said all members of the Cabinet endorsed
Manigat's action, including Defense Minister Williams Regala.
   Regala was the other military member with Namphy of the
three-man junta that ruled Haiti until Manigat was inaugurated
following elections in January.
   Manigat's decision to rescind his top army commander's order
resulted in the first crisis between his civilian government and
the military, which has traditionally held power in this
improverished Caribbean nation.
   Namphy had ordered Col. Paul transferred as commander of the
700-man Dessalines Barracks, the most feared army unit in Haiti, to
assistant chief of staff, a largely administrative post. Paul
reportedly refused to accept the transfer.
   It was unclear why Namphy ordered the transfer, whether it
signified a power struggle within the army or whether the transfer
was linked to the charges of drug-running against Paul, who has
denied the charges.
   Soldiers under Paul's command were blamed for widespread
violence against voters that forced cancellation of last November's
independently adminstrated general elections and left more than 30
people dead.
   Gen. Nicolas, who was the army chief-of-staff, earlier this year
accused the foreign press of singling out Col. Paul, 49, for
attacks related to the drug allegations.

   Federal indictments unsealed Friday
charged 170 people as members of a huge, international drug ring
linked to Panama's Manuel Noriega that dealt in more than $1
billion worth of marijuana and cocaine.
   Noriega was not charged in the indictments, which disclosed that
that the Panamanian strongman allegedly laundered profits from the
sale of marijuana shipped to a Louisiana shipyard.
   ``This organization is sophisticated, well orchestrated and
rivals any multinational corporation,'' U.S. Attorney Joe Cage
said. ``Its sole motivation, greed and money, caused its scope and
influence to transcend local, national and international
boundaries.''
   Cage said the indictments resulted from the same federal
investigation that led to Noriega's indictment in Florida on
charges of laundering U.S. drug money through Panamanian banks.
   If Noriega had not been indicted already in Florida, ``in my
opinion, there would have been sufficient evidence for an
indictment'' here, said Judith Lombardino, lawyer for the federal
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
   Cage said the widespread, 2{-year-old federal investigation
extended into Florida, North Carolina and Michigan.
   The indictment alleges that 170 people conspired to import
nearly 1.5 million pounds of marijuana into the country. Of the
170, more than 100 also are accused of traveling to Lafayette to
arrange the importation of 280,000 pounds of marijuana.
   Cage said 500,000 pounds of marijuana was imported to and
distributed from Lafayette and several thousand pounds of cocaine
was flown to Shreveport.
   The Louisiana investigation centered to a large extent on
shipments of marijuana believed to have been unloaded at the
Intracoastal Drydock and Shipbuilding Co. on the Vermilion River
near the town of Bancker, La.
   The federal grand jury charged Abbeville, La., residents William
E. Faciane and James C. Faciane, both employees of the family owned
shipyard with importing 500,000 pounds of marijuana to the Bancker
site.
   Noriega is alleged to have laundered profits from the sale of
280,000 pounds of marijuana shipped there, the indictment alleges.
   Cage refused to comment on any details of Noriega's alleged
involvement with the drug ring or whether Colombia's Medellin
Cartel was involved. In a federal indictment handed up Feb. 4 in
Miami, Noriega was charged with taking protection money from the
cartel.
   Cage would not identify any of those indicted as ringleaders,
nor would he pinpoint a headquarters for the drug ring.
   ``Each and every individual named in the indictment allegedly
played a vital role in the success of this organization. There is
no such thing as a minimal role in planning and executing a network
of this size.''
   Many of those charged in the 131-page indictment were identified
as ``John Doe.''
   Among those indicted are several foreign nationals believed to
be involved in the systematic trafficking of marijuana and cocaine.
They include David Arrana, Cesar Cura, Vanderbilt Bowie Davis,
Lucio Cardona, all of Colombia;
   Edward ``Gill'' Bodden of the Cayman Islands; Felice Napolitano
of Panama; Ed Whyte, a Canadian citizen living in Jamaica; and
Carlos Zayas-Castro of Colombia and the Cayman Islands.
   Cage said several arrests have been made, but he refused to say
how many.
   He said the federal government's Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Force headed up the investigation, code named
``The Bulldog.''
   The investigation resulted in the indictment of at least 82
other people in the federal judicial districts in North Carolina,
Florida and Michigan.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III anticipates
indictments within 90 days in the massive Pentagon bribery probe
focusing on alleged sale of secret information to defense
contractors through their paid consultants.
   An unusually detailed search warrant, made public Thursday, says
much of the confidential information was improperly funneled to
McDonnell Douglas Corp. The warrant was one of 38 served this week
on 15 defense contractors, half a dozen Pentagon personnel and
consultants.
   According to the warrant, information was passed along by former
Pentagon official Melvyn Paisley, assistant secretary of the Navy
for research, engineering and systems from 1981 to April 1987.
Paisley is now a Washington consultant to numerous defense

In no case did the various approaches protect the animals from

   The U.S. Army hired high-ranking Nazi secret
police officers, stormtroopers, propagandists and collaborators
after World War II and protected them behind an official cloak of
secrecy, according to a harshly critical Justice Department report.
   The report says U.S. military intelligence employed the Nazis to
provide information and monitor Soviet activity in occupied nations
after the war, protecting them from prosecution for war crimes
including torturing and murdering civilians.
   The report focuses at length on the U.S. Army's
Counter-Intelligence Corps' hiring of convicted Nazi war criminal
Robert Jan Verbelen, and its continued employment of him even after
he admitted having been a member of a Nazi security unit that was
declared a criminal organization.

   After a storm of protests from private pilots
and some members of Congress, the government has scaled back its
proposed requirement for small planes to be equipped with
altitude-tracking equipment.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it would
require small private planes to have altitude-encoding transponders
if they fly near 138 airports and in some cases as far as 30 miles
from the runway. The devices provide air traffic controllers with
altitude information about a specific plane on their radar screen.
   Only four months ago, the FAA said it was considering
regulations that would ban small planes from all airspace within 40
miles of 254 airports and above 6,000 feet when not flying near an

   The dimensions of the Pentagon procurement
bribery investigation are ``beyond the wildest imagination,'' Sen.
Charles Grassley told his colleagues Friday while another senator
called the matter the ``most serious case in the history of the
Department of Defense.''
   President Reagan said investigators waited until this week to
tell him about the two-year investigation of the alleged sale of
confidential Pentagon information to defense contractors through
their paid consultants so that there would be no leaks. The affair
came to light when search warrants were issued and telephone taps
disclosed.
   Reagan, in an interview on Public Broadcasting Service's
``Nightly Business Report,'' said, ``I think all of that was part
of the need to keep it so absolutely secret that there wouldn't be
any tipping off that then might allow some wrongdoers to escape and

   Afanasyev, in one of the boldest proposals to date in the
campaign for greater openness, also called for publication in the
Soviet Union of Trotsky's works, which have been banned.

   The parliament on Friday adopted a new
military oath that deletes a pledge to serve in alliance with the
Soviet army, a clause long criticized as an affront to Polish
sovereignty.
   A brief statement by the official news agency PAP said the new
oath, which was recommended by the government and the defense
ministry, was passed unanimously.
   The government has called the change merely a matter of updating
antiquated language and has said it would not affect relations with
the Soviets.

   English soccer fans smashed
windows, overturned cars and hurled beer bottles in Frankfurt on
Friday. Police found the body of an Irish fan who apparently
drowned in the River Main.
   English fans, on a self-proclaimed ``Invasion of Germany 1988,''
descended on the city from Duesseldorf for Saturday's match against
the Soviet Union in the European Soccer Championship.
   Several people, including three police officers, were slightly
injured in Friday's violence. Authorities said the man found in the
river was apparently drunk when he died and not a victim of
violence.

   TABA, Egypt-Israel Border (AP) _ Taba might be returned to Egypt
in a few months, but for now, it's as Israeli as a kibbutz. It
fact, it is Israel.
   Try popping over from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula for lunch at the
plush 327-room Aviya-Sonesta Beach Hotel, the only place that
really counts in the tiny enclave claimed by both Egypt and Israel.
   ``Are you going to Israel?'' asked the Egyptian policeman at the
gate of a chain-link fence a few hundred yards from the
white-painted, 10-story hotel.
   ``No, just to that hotel.''
   ``That,'' the policeman said, ``is Israel.''
   It took 30 minutes to complete paperwork required to get from
the Egyptian gate to a similar one 75 yards away where Israeli
customs inspectors waited.
   Lunch is delayed 90 minutes more.
   ``Did anybody in Egypt give you anything to deliver in Israel?''
one of the Israelis asked.
   No, I just want to have lunch in that hotel there.
   ``Did you buy anything in Egypt that you didn't see being
packed?''
   No, I live in Egypt. I just want to have lunch in that hotel
right there.
   ``They didn't try to tell you in Egypt that Taba is not
Israel's, did they?''
   Taba, where nobody lives permanently and the hotel, its guests
and the beach are all that matters, is a political curiosity left
over from war.
   At the extreme east-central edge of the Sinai Peninsula where
the Gulf of Aqaba ends, it fell to the Israelis in the 1967
Arab-Isaraeli war. The Israelis pulled out of the rest of Sinai in
1982 _ in accordance with the peace treaty signed three years
earlier _ but kept Taba, a squib of 250 acres just south of
Israel's Eilat and west of Jordan's Aqaba, both on the Gulf of
Aqaba.
   The crux of the competing claims is the location of Marker 91,
the southernmost marker delineating British-mandated Palestine in a
1906 agreement between the British and the Ottoman empires. The
Egyptians say their maps show the marker generally where Israel's
entry point is. Israel's maps put it at the Egyptian fence.
   After years of contention, Egypt and Israel agreed in September
1986 to appoint arbiters to sit down in Geneva and decide whether
Taba is extreme eastern Sinai (Egypt) or extreme southern Israel.
   Both sides summed up their arguments in April, and under the
arbitration agreement a judgment should be issued by midsummer, a
final, binding decision.
   Before the Israelis came, Taba basically comprised a
stone-and-sand beach at the end of a desert wadi.
   There's still precious little in Taba besides the Sonesta and
Rafi Nelson's Village, a swimming facility with a pub and snack bar
at the beach.
   Coiled barbed wire separates the hotel's swimming pool and
volleyball courts from the road. A hill with a guard tower at the
top commands one side of the hotel. On the other side are 800 yards
of Gulf of Aqaba beach and Rafi Nelson's Village. The employees of
the hotel and the village live in Eilat, a mile or so away.
   While on the face of it Taba hardly seems worth the fuss, it
seems clear that both governments went to the wall for their claims
with an eye to domestic politics.
   Egypt's leaders have said repeatedly that Israel will be ceded
``not one centimeter'' of Egyptian land. Thus, Taba either must be
returned, or it must be adjudged not to be Egyptian.
   As for the Israelis, they too undoubtedly would find a binding
legal verdict more palatable than a bilateral compromise. Publicly,
they say the enclave would be strategically critical for Eilat
should the Egyptians, the only Arabs at peace with Israel, turn
hostile again.
   Taba's guard tower is manned by the Multinational Force and
Observers, an international group organized under the 1979
U.S.-brokered peace treaty, which the arbitration agreement brought
into the enclave for the first time.
   The implication was that until sovereignty was determined, the
enclave would be a no man's land.
   Cairo never has told its people otherwise, and they can't learn
firsthand because their government has forbidden them to enter Taba
until the Egyptian claim is vindicated.
   As for the hotel, owned by Israeli Eli Papoushado and managed by
the Sonesta chain, nobody wants to talk about what might happen if
Taba becomes Egyptian. It's too sensitive an issue right now.
   In the meantime, Western women occasionally doff bikini tops
around the swimming pool and on the beach.
   But one indication of what might happen in an Egyptian Taba are
the signs at the gate going back to Egypt.
   No doffing of swimsuits at the Egyptian beach, they say.

<TEXT>
   Author Robert Daley knows that the
quick grip of fear and split-second decisions that can make or
break a cop's career are not just the stuff of police fiction.
   A former deputy commissioner of the New York City Police
Department, Daley has grabbed the attention of readers on subjects
ranging from treasure diving in Florida to bullfighting in Spain,
but is best known for his insider's tales of street crime and
police bureaucracy.
   During an interview at the converted cottage on his Ridgefield
estate where he does his writing, the best-selling author of ``Year
of a Dragon,'' ``Hands of a Stranger'' and ``Prince of the City,''
explained how fact and fantasy merge in his latest novel, ``Man
With a Gun'' (Simon & Schuster, $19.95).
   ``Most of the incidents happened to me one way or the other, but
they didn't happen just that way,'' Daley said. ``All of them have
been extracted from the way they actually happened and moved
together to make a story.''
   The story of ``Man With a Gun'' is loosely based on events
surrounding the Harlem Mosque murder of 1972, when a police officer
was killed during a confrontation between black Muslims and
authorities. The book deals with the power and politics behind the
police handling of a situation where every decision has long-term
consequences.
   ``In moments of terror you do what it seems like you have to do
and no one is responsible for that,'' Daley said.
   ``I made some mistakes which didn't seem like mistakes at the
time,'' he said of his involvement in the Mosque riots.
   Daley and the central character in ``Man With a Gun,'' Phillip
Keefe, are alike in many ways. Keefe is a deputy police
commissioner and, like Daley, resigns after the incident. Keefe is
a former journalist. Daley worked for five years as a foreign
correspondent for The New York Times. Keefe drives a Porsche; so
does Daley.
   However, Keefe is Daley, the author insists. ``I have no ghosts
to exorcise.''
   For one thing, Keefe is not a successful author. Daley has 20
books to his credit. Five novels have been made into films, and
Paul Newman is slated to play the lead role in ``Man With a Gun.''
   In his novels, the 57-year-old Daley aims to provide more than a
mirror image of life. Literature should provide ``new insights into
your own life, into everybody's life, a new understanding of what
we are all up against,'' he said.
   Novels about the police, however, tend to be grouped together as
thrillers, said Daley, who considers thrillers to be books with
``preposterous characters doing preposterous acts all the time.''
   ``Thriller means discardable, thriller means light
entertainment, thriller means not important,'' he said. ``The word
denigrates what I am trying to do. I think I am writing something
else and keep getting accused of writing thrillers.''
   As an undergraduate studying literature at Fordham University,
Daley said he wanted to be the greatest writer that ever lived. He
has since lowered his goal to writing books that will stand the
test of time.
   Translations of Daley's books cram his closets. ``I can't throw
them away because they are books and books are icons.'' Samples of
his photographic work decorate his walls.
   Daley bought a camera when The New York Times offered to pay him
$15 extra for every photograph used in the newspaper. His
photographs have since been exhibited at the Baltimore Museum, the
Art Institute in Chicago and the New York Gallery of Modern Art.
   But he prefers writing.
   ``To me literature is the greatest of the arts because it takes
you further outside yourself than any other,'' he said, adding
there's also a practical side to his work. ``I don't want to be
poor. I wouldn't give up the things we have in order to be a
renowned writer that no one ever reads.'' He keeps apartments in
France and New York, as well as his Connecticut home where he lives
with his wife.
   Currently working on a ``part personal memoir, part history of
France,'' Daley said he considers the time spent writing the book
as a rest period from the pressures of producing what is expected
of him.
   ``I have to write something that's going to sell,'' he said.
``(You) get trapped in whatever it is that you are doing that's
successful.''

<HEAD>China Expands Arms Sales for Profit and Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign arms sales have been a quiet source of
funds for China's military establishment in the 1980s, but for the
government the deals can be a political minefield.
   No sooner did controversy die down over China's surprise sale of
medium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia than reports circulated that
Beijing was selling missile technology to Argentina and Pakistan,
and that Pakistan used the technology to produce a missile capable
of carrying nuclear warheads, which would be a threat to India.
   All sides denied the reports, but they highlighted China's
growing role as an international arms merchant with increasingly
sophisticated wares _ and seemingly few scruples about the buyers.
   A case in point is China's much-publicized sale of Silkworm
missiles to Iran after selling fighter planes to Iran's enemy, Iraq.
   Primarily a donor of small arms to African and Southeast Asian
revolutionaries in the 1960s, China has become the fourth largest
weapons seller to the Third World, after the Soviet Union, United
States and France, according to the U.S. government.
   China sold an estimated $1.5 billion worth of weapons in 1986
and about $2 billion worth in 1987, according to U.S. figures.
China does not release any figures, and Chinese officials refused
to discuss arms sales.
   China still lags far behind the world's leading arms seller, the
Soviet Union, which had 1986 sales of more than $15 billion. But
weapons make up an increasing share of Chinese exports, from less
than 2 percent in 1978 to more than 5 percent last year.
   For that it has mainly to thank the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. It
has sold $4.5 billion worth of arms to both sides, according to
U.S. government estimates, including the Silkworms to Iran that
gave China its first taste of political backlash.
   The United States last year briefly halted its program of
expanding high-tech sales to China to show its pique over the
Silkworms, with which Iran threatens Persian Gulf shipping. China
insists Iran gets the Silkworms from someone else.
   Iran in turn reportedly is unhappy over China's recent sale of
CSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia, substitutes for U.S. F-15 fighters
that the U.S. Congress blocked.
   The missiles have a range of 2,200 miles and can be fitted with
nuclear warheads. Iran, with which Saudi Arabia recently severed
diplomatic relations, is a logical target.
   Missiles and other sophisticated weapons still account for only
a small portion of China's arms sales, which consist mostly of
small arms and field artillery. However, its tanks and fighter
planes have become increasingly popular, especially since China
began upgrading them with British and Italian technology.
   Pakistan, a regular buyer of Chinese aircraft, replaces the
engines in them with British ones.
   Foreign sources who keep watch on arms deals say sales abroad
have helped fund weapons development for the Chinese military,
whose share of the state budget dropped from 17.5 percent in 1979
to less than 10 percent in 1986 as the government puts priority on
economic development.
   But China also is believed to be seeking influence and
recognition as an important player in world trouble spots, even at
the cost of criticism.
   China's main customers are developing countries embroiled in
regional conflicts and who don't want to depend solely on the
Soviet Union or the United States. Thailand, which buys most of its
arms from the United States, bought an estimated $10 million worth
of tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery from China last
year in part as a gesture of independence.
   Low prices, speedy delivery and simple weapons design that can
easily be maintained by low-tech Third World armies are other
attractions. The tanks China sold Thailand, for example, cost about
$200,000 each _ less than one-fifth the price of U.S. tanks that
Thailand bought a few months later.
   The Chinese tanks were delivered within months of order. The
U.S. tanks have yet to arrive.

<HEAD>Guarding the Rich Legacy of Fred Astaire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During their seven-year marriage, Fred
Astaire often told his wife, Robyn: ``People have taken advantage
of me all my life. Try to see that it doesn't happen after I'm
gone.''
   That has been Mrs. Astaire's consuming mission since the dancing
actor's death a year ago.
   ``I didn't realize how difficult it would be,'' she said.
``Everyone wants a piece of Fred now.''
   She cited a Hollywood Boulevard operator who has been selling
life-size cutouts of Astaire to be used in stores and amusement
parks. Companies have tried to merchandise Fred Astaire lines of
tuxedos, jewelry and cologne. Robyn Astaire has hired a lawyer to
try to police such ventures, and she is supported by new laws
protecting the names and images of deceased celebrities.
   Mrs. Astaire is also disturbed by the use of her husband's name
and works by companies or individuals who don't consult her, such
as the sale by MCA to the Disney Channel of the Astaire TV
specials, the only films that he owned. He made his classic
musicals while under contract to studios.
   She doesn't rule out licensing of products that met the Astaire
standards of class.
   ``Fred wanted me to do that,'' she said. ``He was so afraid that
he wouldn't be able to provide for me after he was gone. You see,
when he turned 78, he decided it was time to put his affairs in
order. He never expected to marry again, so he gave most of his
wealth to his family, keeping only what he needed to live on.''
   Then he met Robyn Smith, a lithe, young jockey who had broken
the sex barrier in thoroughbred racing. They were married June 24,
1980, when he was 81 and she was 35. The marriage astonished
Hollywood and appalled Fred's sister, Adele, and daughter, Ava. But
it endured.
   Mrs. Astaire recently talked about her life with Fred at the
hilltop home she shared with him. It is unchanged, as is she; daily
running keeps her 5-foot-7 frame at 106 pounds.
   ``By the time we were married, Fred had done everything in his
life _ more than once,'' she related. ``He was in a mood to relax
and take it easy. That was fine with me. He was such an exciting
person to be around that we didn't have to do a lot. We just always
had a lot of fun _ I know that.
   ``I was happy with my life before that. As with any athlete,
when you get into your 30s, you are forced to retire. Everyone
thinks you're over the hill when you turn 25.
   ``Besides, Fred wanted me to get out of the (racing) business
because it was very dangerous. I was ready to quit anyway. But I
made Fred sell his horses because I wasn't about to let him run
them if I couldn't ride.''
   Fred and Robyn Astaire played some golf together and attended
the latest movies, ``always at 12 o'clock at a neighborhood theater
so he wouldn't be recognized.'' She even had him watch his own
movies at home.
   ``I had never seen a Fred Astaire picture that I can remember,''
she admitted. ``I just wasn't interested in musicals when I was
young. I never realized what I had missed.
   ``Fred never liked watching himself in movies. But I wanted to
see them, and they absolutely blew my mind. At my insistence, he
started watching them with me. He was so cute. When I said, `Oh,
darling, it's so spectacular,' he'd say, `Oh, was it really good?'
Toward the end of his life he enjoyed watching the films, which he
had never allowed himself to do.''
   ``I Won't Dance'' goes the old Astaire tune, and he wouldn't do
so after his last TV show at 70. But on their rare appearances at
Hollywood events, Fred danced with Robyn. And nightly after dinner,
they exited the dining room in a comic tango that convulsed the
servants.
   Astaire was in perfect health until the last six months of his
life, she said. He started losing weight, and that alarmed her. His
doctors could find nothing wrong, but Robyn feared that he might
develop pneumonia, the killer of the aged.
   ``I thought Fred would live into his 90s,'' she said. ``His
mother had died at 96, and he was just like his mother. All of a
sudden when he reached 86 he started to get weaker and weaker. He
wasn't ill; his batteries were draining.''
   Last June, he developed pneumonia. She drove him to Century City
Hospital late at night to avoid public notice, and entered him
under his mother's maiden name. His presence there was kept secret
until his death on June 22.
   For the past year, Mrs. Astaire has devoted herself to
preserving her huband's rich legacy, but she realizes she will need
to start a life of her own. Next month she is enrolling in an
intensive course at the University of California at Los Angeles to
determine what kind of a career she should pursue.
   She grinned: ``I just hope the results don't show that the only
thing I'm qualified for is to be a jockey.''

<TEXT>
   Anti-union laws, Japanese work
techniques and a scarcity of jobs have begun to transform Britain's
once-militant labor unions.
   Single-union and no-strike deals are spreading, provoking a
bitter fight among the country's declining unions and threatening
to split their umbrella organization, the Trades Union Congress _
the TUC.
   In this ugly red-brick, Yorkshire city of 59,000, a new
$93-million plant being built jointly by Coca-Cola Co. and Cadbury
Schweppes PLC is bringing 500 new jobs to a region where
unemployment is 12.7 percent, nearly 4 percentage points above the
national average.
   The plant's work force will be represented by a single union,
where past practice would have meant each worker category would
have had its own union.
   But while that may be bad news for the 120-year-old TUC, it is
no big issue in places like Wakefield, where the decline of
traditional coal and textile industries makes getting a job much
more important than defending union rights.
   ``Unions are on the way out,'' said Wakefield's Nigel Bilton, 22
years old and unemployed. ``I think unions should be abolished.''
   Thirty single-union deals, 10 of which include no-strike
provisions, have been struck in British industry, up from six
single-union deals and zero no-strike agreements five years ago,
according to the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU).
   ``The number is growing. We envision it doubling by the end of
this year,'' says John Mann, the union's research manager.
   Such deals, under which one union represents all the workers at
a plant and arbitration replaces strikes, are expected to multiply
even faster after a stunning defeat for the unions in Scotland this
past March.
   Japanese, then American, and now British companies have sought
these new single-union deals because they find it simpler and
cheaper to negotiate with one union rather than several.
   The 42,000 workers at Ford Motor Co. in Britain, for example,
have 12 different unions.
   Ford has scrapped plans to build an electronics plant in Dundee
in Scotland because it couldn't get its unions to accept the
single-union deal it had reached with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union.
   The dramatic reversal scuttled what would have been Ford's 23rd
British plant, cost 450 new jobs and provoked widespread anger
against what Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind termed the unions'
``neanderthal attitudes.''
   Opponents of single-union deals maintain, however, that one
union cannot adequately represent a work force ranging from
engineers to typists.
   Championing the new union deals are the 800,000-member AEU and
the 360,000-member Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and
Plumbing Union (EETPU).
   Membership in the 84-union TUC has shrunk from 13 million to 9
million since 1979, and the government can now boast that the days
when Britain could be crippled by strikes are over. Days lost to
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 2.5 million in
the year up to March.
   Unemployment is one reason, but another is Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's legislation, which forces unions to take strike
votes and obtain a 55-percent yes-vote before calling a walkout.
The legislation also outlaws secondary picketing, and no longer
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have
chosen it in a vote.
   The Trades Union Congress is threatening to expel the EETPU
electricians at its annual meeting in September over single-union
deals.
   At the same time, the EETPU is asking its members in a ballot
whether to pull out of the TUC and talking to the AEU about joining
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take
away one-ninth of the TUC's membership.
   ``Such a split in the union movement would change the face of
industrial relations and have serious implications for the Labor
Party,'' the Independent newspaper wrote.
   The Labor Party is the main opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party government, and the unions are the Laborites
power base.
   The Wakefield factory, which is Europe's newest soft-drink
plant, ``is going to mean a lot for the community of Wakefield,''
said Mayor George Parkinson.
   Dick Croft, a local official for the engineering union that will
represent the Wakefield plant workers, said the community was lucky
that Coke and Cadbury decided to have any union at all.
   The new style has been introduced largely by egalitarian-minded
Japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes, put in
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as
well as for management.
   They offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and
shopfloor moderation. British workers have embraced the change,
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding
class distinctions.
   Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, argues that
single-union deals encourage damaging competition among unions for
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement.
   The 1.35-million-member Transport and General Workers Union,
Britain's largest, also is a major opponent of the new style for
pretty much the same reasons.
   But up here in Yorkshire, the engineering union's Croft said,
``The world is changing. We don't enjoy the same franchise we had a
few years ago.''

   A new film talent has emerged from the satirical
movie ``A Handful of Dust.'' Her name is Kristin Scott Thomas.
   The movie features Alec Guinness and Anjelica Huston in small
but telling cameos, but it is dominated by Scott Thomas as the
elegant English rose, Lady Brenda Last, who drifts into a
destructive affair with the young roue John Beaver (Rupert Graves).
   Based on Evelyn Waugh's savage 1934 novel, the $6 million film
co-stars James Wilby (Graves' co-star last year in ``Maurice'') as
Lady Brenda's hapless husband, Tony. It opens in New York on June
24.
   ``I'm very pleased, I'm afraid, about the reaction that I'm
getting. It's so nice to have one's work appreciated,'' Scott
Thomas said in an interview about her repeated raves from the
British press.
   While reviews were mixed for the movie as a whole, critics
hailed its female lead with the kind of accolades that banish
anonymity forever.
   Alexander Walker in The Standard called the actress ``the film's
great find,'' adding, ``It will be criminal if British cinema
doesn't ... make a great star of her.''
   Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd in The Daily Telegraph and Derek
Malcolm in The Guardian both called her ``a revelation.'' Iain
Johnstone in The Sunday Times found the Paris-based actress ``a
singular sensation'' in a movie that has returned her in triumph to
the country she left eight years ago.
   ``I never really thought I'd be able to work in England, so `A
Handful of Dust' was an enormous pleasure and a great privilege,''
said the 28-year-old actress, who dropped out of London's Central
School of Speech and Drama after a year to move to Paris.
   ``I was doing a teacher training course and hated it, wanted to
change and couldn't,'' said Scott Thomas, occasionally interrupting
the interview to tend to the cries of her month-old daughter,
Hannah.
   ``I was told I'd never be an actress anyway, and would never be
able to play for real,'' she said. ``I thought it would be better
to be totally miserable somewhere else and learn French at the same
time.''
   In Paris, her life took a happier turn, beginning with her
marriage to a French obstetrician. After drama training in French,
she began getting parts in theater and in movies, and landed a role
opposite the rock superstar Prince in his second movie, a bomb
called ``Under the Cherry Moon.''
   The film was not a financial success and was lampooned by
critics. However, it enjoyed an international release. Charles
Sturridge, the director of ``Handful of Dust'' and of the hit Waugh
TV adaptation, ``Brideshead Revisited,'' saw it and cast Scott
Thomas as Lady Brenda.
   She had studied the book at school and said she seized the
chance to become part of the film.
   ``I was sure it was going to be great,'' she recalled, before
going back to the novel to immerse herself in Lady Brenda's
emotionally fatal attraction to the callow and cunning Beaver.
   ``She likes taking someone who is absolutely dreadful and
turning him into this fascinating young man whom no one can
understand what she sees in him,'' Scott Thomas said, explaining
the fascination on which the film's denouement depends: ``It makes
her different, too.''
   ``In the end, Beaver is much worse than Lady Brenda ever thought
he was, really; by then she's in too deep,'' she said.
   The daughter of an affluent naval officer who died when she was
five, Scott Thomas said she was bemused by the critique of the
English class system that pervades the book and the film.
   ``It's quite sort of endearing, really, but it is ridiculous,''
said Scott Thomas, a graduate of the posh Cheltenham Ladies'
College. ``It's like some dear old piece of furniture that you like
but you think is quite the most hideous thing in the world.''
   She hopes not to be typecast as aristocratic English swells, and
would like to do a French film next.
   ``I live there and I want to work there. You have to work hard,
and I really mean to work hard,'' she said. ``I've got to make sure
that the revelation doesn't turn out to be a disaster.''

<HEAD>Summer Picnics: Handle Food Carefully</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mountain parks and sunny beaches beckon
Americans by the millions in summer to pack up their lunches and
picnic. A seemingly simple meal, however, can pose a hazard if not
properly prepared and handled.
   Sometimes it seems like the scientists are trying to take the
fun out of everything with their warnings. Yet the Department of
Health and Human Services reports that as many as one American in
six will be the victim of food poisoning in an average year.
   And nearly all of these cases are easily preventable with a
little common sense, say government food safety experts.
   To get out that word, the Food and Drug Administration and the
Department of Agriculture are testing a toll-free hotline for food
safety questions this summer.
   The test, limited to the states of Florida, Illinois and
Massachusetts, will continue through August. Residents of those
states can call 1-800-426-3758 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EDT.
   Residents of other states may call the Agriculture Department's
Meat and Poultry Hotline, 1-800-535-4555.
   In general, the common food safety rules apply: Keep hot foods
hot and keep cold foods cold. That means hot foods should be stored
and served at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or more, cold foods at 45
degrees or lower.
   Here are some suggestions from the USDA:
   _Shop with a plan. Pick up perishable items last so they can be
taken home and refrigerated speedily.
   _You can pack non-perishable items the night before the picnic _
things like paper plates, plastic utensils, napkins, potato chips
and so forth. Bring along extra plastic bags for trash and garbage.
   _Pack the cooler on the day of the picnic. Use plenty of ice and
a well-insulated cooler containing only the items that need to be
kept cold, such as hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, eggs and the like.
Make sure the foods are tightly wrapped.
   _Uncooked hamburgers and other raw foods should be sealed in
plastic bags or containers so juices cannot contaminate other items.
   _Scrub vegetables and other items that may be eaten raw to
remove parasites and germs as well as any insecticide that may have
been sprayed on them.
   _At the picnic, keep the cooler in the shade, keep the lid
closed and remove items only when they are needed.
   _Hungry picnickers may urge speedy cooking. If you have chicken,
chops or other items that take time to cook, cook them at home in
advance and then just reheat on the picnic grill to save time. When
reheating, barbecue sauce will keep meats from drying out.
   _Be sure to cook raw meats thoroughly; food-poisoning organisms
can sometimes survive a short cooking time.
   _Don't start cooking until people are ready to eat so food won't
sit around. When foods are left standing for two hours or so,
bacteria multiply rapidly.
   _Keep lefotvers only if there is enough ice in the cooler to
preserve them until you get home. Otherwise, discard them.

<HEAD>Father of 35 Preaches What He Practices _ Taking in Unwanted
Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   He's a bachelor who long ago traded the
solitary life for 15 loads of wash every day, a four-figure grocery
bill every month and enough sons and daughters to fill a classroom
_ 35 in all.
   Meet Kojo Odo. Adoptive father. Tenacious fighter. A man who
takes in children no one else wants: the abused, the abandoned, the
sickly, the scarred. It doesn't matter. Odo finds a place for each
in his heart.
   In his private life, Odo gives unwanted kids a home and hope. In
his public life, he urges others to do the same.
   As Ohio's administrator for special adoptions, Odo works to find
homes for children, especially those hard to place. He needed no
training for this job. His life is his resume.
   In 15 years, Odo has almost single-handedly raised 35 children.
Seven sons now live on their own; the 21 sons and seven daughters
who share his 10-bedroom home range from 6 years old to 22.
   They'll be together Father's Day, but ``it's just another day,''
Odo said. There may be handmade gifts, but the gifts he treasures
most are his children.
   ``The kids are my dreams,'' he said. ``They bring me a level of
satisfaction and achievement. You can take my life ... my money ...
my car. You can burn down my house. You can't take away whatever I
helped my kids achieve.''
   The achievements for some of the children include walking with
crutches after doctors predicted lifetimes in wheelchairs, or
living when they were supposed to die.
   If this seems like a miracle, it isn't _ Odo says love and
stability are all-important. If it sounds inspirational, it is.
   ``If you have the capacity to raise ... and deal with all those
children, you're definitely a credible individual,'' said co-worker
Carol Hector-Harris. ``Someone who lives it as well as works it:
they're believable.''
   Odo says he is proof people needn't be ``mainstream America'' to
adopt a child.
   In a gray flannel world of button-down bureaucrats, Odo, 48,
favors knee-high boots, a knit skull cap and thick, clanging silver
bracelets. Ten golden earrings circle one ear, a gold ring pierces
a nostril and a jeweled stud sits smack dab at the center of his
chin.
   Odo, former civil rights activist and teacher, originally
planned to adopt children once he married. When he was ready,
however, he was still single. And adoption posed many obstacles for
a single, black man.
   After a long investigation, Odo received his first child _ a
7-year-old, one-armed boy. ``He had had seven placements in seven
years,'' he recalled. ``He was emotionally scarred right to the
heart ... but a survivor.''
   Once when Odo hoisted up his son up to a mirror, the boy broke
into tears. Odo thought he was hurting him. Then he found the
problem.
   ``He had always been told he would grow an arm,'' Odo said.
``When he didn't grow an arm, he stopped looking in the mirror.''
   That boy became Odo's pride. ``He grew and made you grow, too,''
he recalled. At 16, he played football and basketball, had
girlfriends and took college entrance exams.
   But in 1982, an assailant stabbed the boy to death in New York
City.``I'm still in mourning for my son,'' Odo said, his eyes
filling with tears. ``Nothing hurt me like that.''
   Yet, he added, ``he made it possible to take some of the
others.''
   Some of Kojo's kids have visible scars. A boy whose legs were
burned when he was dunked in boiling water. A nearly blind
hyperactive child. A boy with deformed ears, a cleft palate,
dislocated hips and a heart murmur. A boy with spina bifida. A girl
with syphilis of the spine.
   Others have emotional scars. One son saw his mother's boyfriend
beat his younger brother to death. ``He was like an animal,'' Odo
said. ``They couldn't put him in a house. They put him in an
institution.''
   His children's abilities vary _ some earn A's and B's at school,
others never finish. Some help with the cooking and watch the
younger children; others are limited to simpler tasks, such as
sweeping floors.
   Odo had reservations as his family grew.
   ``Up to 12 or 15 kids, after every kid, I'd say `No more.' I'd
reach a point at where the kid had adjusted. (I'd think) God, there
are so many kids out there. We've gotten the routine down well. I
can take one more.''
   Odo adopts sight unseen. He reviews their records, but says:
``There is no way you can fabricate a meeting without the kid
knowing you're shopping.''
   Some of Odo's children had families unwilling or unable to care
for them _ 11 of the children are siblings from five families.
Others came from institutions.
   Odo never calls his children handicapped. ``I consider labels to
be cages,'' he said. ``If I say `challenged,' the sky's the limit.''
   That attitude motivates.
   ``He was the first man who opened my world,'' said son Konata,
28, a social worker and free-lance artist who lives in New York.
``He was to me the ideal man ... successful, very articulate. ...
He loved people, he loved kids.''
   But Odo's no pushover.
   ``He expects a lot from us,'' said his 17-year-old son,
Kefentse. ``He taught me self-respect. He taught me how to love _
you have to look at the person and see what they need. ... He's
broadened (my) horizons. He's made a future for me.''
   The children share a tradition _ African names beginning with
`k.' Odo composes a list of choices after ``they tell me what they
want their names to say about them or their potential.''
   Kojo's kids live in a rambling, white-frame former retirement
home. Assigned chores are listed on a kitchen wall. The children
rise and go to bed in shifts. Allowance varies according to age.
   Odo is father, mother, teacher and friend. After work, he
ignores the ringing of video games and the TV and maneuvers around
wheelchairs and braces cluttering the hallway, reprimanding one son
for acting up in school, a daughter for wearing a short skirt.
   ``People have told me I should have help,'' he said. ``I want
the children to feel it's a family, not an institution.''
   Odo wakes up about 5:30 a.m. and stuffs the first load of
laundry into the machine. He spends about $1,600 a month to feed
his huge family. Every three months, he buys a cow for slaughter.
   Odo supports his family with his salary, money from speaking
engagements and government subsidies paid for his children.
   ``I think every kid has the potential to do more than they have
done,'' he said. ``If we give them the vehicle ... that's all I've
been ... they'll make use of it. Some will be doing it better than
others. Some will be doing it quicker than others. All of them do
it.''

<HEAD>Disappointment Expressed Over Slow Progress in AIDS Treatments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More scientists in more countries are
doing more research on AIDS than ever before, but progress toward
better treatments remains disappointingly slow.
   ``I had a feeling during the year that we'd see a little more
movement on the treatment side,'' said Dr. Mervyn Silverman,
president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. ``I'm a
little bit disappointed in that.''
   Silverman's comments were echoed by others as the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS, the largest AIDS meeting ever
held, ended last week.
   Seven-thousand researchers from 140 countries had met to pore
over 3,200 research reports on acquired immune deficiency syndrome
and its cause, the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   ``More people are studying HIV than any other virus,'' said
David Baltimore of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
   AIDS research ``is a growth industry,'' said Silverman. ``And
I'd like to think with all that dedication there will be some
breakthroughs.''
   No breakthroughs were announced in Stockholm.
   Bo Oberg of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said more than
50 experimental drugs were under development as possible AIDS
treatments.
   ``It's hopeful that a large number of compounds are coming
along,'' he said, ``but it's going to be complicated to evaluate
them.''
   As of June 1, the World Health Organization had received reports
of 96,433 AIDS cases from around the world, double the number
reported at the time of the Third International Conference on AIDS
held in Washington, D.C., a year ago.
   Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's AIDS program, estimated that
the actual number of AIDS cases in the world was closer to 150,000,
and that another 150,000 cases would occur this year.
   At least 5 million people are infected with the AIDS virus and
as many as several hundred million people are engaging in behavior
that puts them at risk of AIDS, Mann said.
   In the United States alone, new AIDS cases are being reported at
the rate of one every 14 minutes, said Dr. James Curran of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   Curran, who updates the U.S. statistics each year at the
international AIDS conference, seemed painfully aware of the human
toll that those figures represent. ``It's getting harder every
year,'' he said.
   Standing in the cavernous main hall at the Stockholm convention
center, Curran looked up at two enormous quilts suspended from the
ceiling, each with a score of panels bearing the names of AIDS
victims. ``It's even harder to have the predictions turn out
right,'' he said.
   The AIDS research effort has matured, Curran said, providing a
solid foundation of knowledge on the virus and the epidemic. But he
said thornier questions remain to be answered.
   ``More people are getting involved in prevention and behavior
research, but still not enough,'' he said. ``There's a gap in
understanding of sexual behavior and intravenous drug abuse.''
   Such research is crucial because, as a Swedish AIDS publication
said last week, ``knowledge is the only vaccine we have.''
   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, remains the only drug
that's been shown to improve the lot of people with AIDS _ or PWAs,
as they're often called.
   With AZT, ``we've improved the quality of life and extended
survival,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami.
She, too, said she was disappointed by the pace of drug research.
   Dr. Samuel Broder of the National Cancer Institute, a leader in
the U.S. government's effort to devise newer and safer AIDS drugs,
had a different view.
   ``There is more drug development and more progress against the
AIDS virus than against any other virus known,'' he said. Half a
dozen drugs look especially promising and are under intensive
development, he said.
   The disappointment that some researchers expressed reflected ``a
sense of frustration, of the urgency of the problem,'' he said.
   ``We all have a sense of urgency to come up with safe and
effective ways of handling the AIDS virus. As long as we have one
patient who will die of AIDS, we haven't made enough progress.''
   If the development of drugs to treat AIDS is tough, the
development of a vaccine to prevent AIDS is tougher still. Dr.
Jonas Salk, the polio vaccine pioneer, and Dr. Daniel Zagury, the
courageous French researcher who in 1986 injected himself with an
experimental AIDS vaccine, both reported encouraging plans _ and
little progress _ toward an AIDS vaccine.
   Attempts to vaccinate chimpanzees against AIDS have largely
failed, various researchers reported.
   ``We should not despair,'' said Reinhard Kurth of the Paul
Erlich- Institute in Frankfurt, West Germany. ``Many avenues have
not been tried yet.''
   One important development welcomed at the conference was the
finding that a new AIDS test called the polymerase chain reaction
test, or PCR, is apparently much more sensitive and accurate than
any existing test.
   The test, which can detect even very small amounts of the AIDS
virus, will assist researchers studying the development of AIDS in
infected individuals.
   And if its effectiveness is confirmed in subsequent studies, the
test may be critical to the detection and treatment of AIDS in
infants, researchers said.
   Infants born to infected mothers carry AIDS antibodies that they
have acquired in the womb, but not all actually acquire the virus.
Yet because all of them have antibodies to the virus, antibody
tests cannot reveal which are infected and which aren't.
   The PCR could provide the first definitive diagnosis of AIDS in
infants. The number of such unfortunate babies is growing, as AIDS
spreads among drug abusers.
   This year's AIDS conference was somewhat unusual in that
participants were regularly reminded that the object was to cure
sick people _ not merely to advance an intellectual enterprise.
   Many medical conferences are rather impersonal affairs, in which
science is discussed on a lofty plane and the immediate concerns of
patients are left to another place and time.
   At this conference, however, a variety of talks dealt with the
importance of taking care of patients.
   ``I've been critical of some meetings in the past, because
patient care hasn't been important,'' said Dr. Constance Wofsy of
San Francisco General Hospital. ``And I think that's important.''
   Dr. Anthony Pinching of St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in
London brought the concerns of patients to center stage,
emphasizing that doctors have much to learn from them.
   ``They are the most important teachers,'' Pinching said, ``and
if we listen, there is hope.''

<HEAD>Bugs, Daffy, Dumbo and Betty Boop Star in Private-Eye Caper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a goofy, daffy idea, a Mickey Mouse
notion if ever there was one, to combine cartoon characters with
human actors in a big budget film.
   The Walt Disney Co. is taking a gamble that might have given
pause to even its risk-taking founder. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''
reaches the nation's screens Wednesday after three years of
planning and production and an estimated $40 million in costs.
   It's a project that combines a 1940s private-eye caper with just
about every cartoon character in film history.
   The movie stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna
Cassidy, plus Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Dumbo, Daffy Duck, Betty
Boop, Donald Duck and two cartoon newcomers, the comic Roger Rabbit
and his sexpot wife, Jessica.
   In the film, a down-at-the-heels detective (Hoskins) is hired by
a cartoon studio boss to uncover why his star, Roger Rabbit, is
unable to perform. Hoskins discovers the star's voluptuous wife is
being blackmailed as part of an elaborate scheme to take over the
cartoon studio to make way for real estate development and a
freeway.
   The project originated from a book by Gary K. Wolf, ``Who
Censored Roger Rabbit,'' which an earlier Disney regime bought for
a feature film. A rising young director, Robert Zemeckis, read the
script in 1982 and was interested in making the film. But the
Disney company, beleaguered by flops and takeover threats, was
unable to mount the production.
   Four years later, Zemeckis had already directed the hits
``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Back to the Future,'' and Disney had
been revitalized by new management. The company enlisted Steven
Spielberg as a partner, and he showed the script to Zemeckis in the
winter of 1985.
   ``The first thing we had to do was decide whether in fact we
could make the movie,'' said Zemeckis, who resembles an overgrown
kid at 37. ``It had never been done before.
   ``So we asked Disney for permission to do a test, a 30-second
obstacle course for Roger. Richard (Williams) animated it, and ILM
(Industrial Light and Magic) did the optical work. When it was
finished, we were all astounded, and there was no doubt that we
were going forward.
   ``One of the prerequisites that I laid down to do the movie was
that it really needed all the cartoon characters from the other
studios.''
   Spielberg was the spark plug in acquiring the clearances.
   Zemeckis bypassed the Disney animation department and hired
Williams, a Canadian, as animator. Williams had made a number of
imaginative films, including the 1971 Academy Award-winning ``A
Christmas Carol,'' and done the ``Pink Panther'' animation.
   ``Bob told me he wanted the Disney articulation, Warners
characters and (Tex) Avery humor _ but not so brutal,'' Williams
said. Avery was the gifted animator of Bugs Bunny and other far-out
characters.
   ``In other words, we should aim for believability but it could
be zany.'' Williams and his staff faced the challenge of developing
the title character. After all, rabbits had already been cartoon
stars, from Walt Disney's Oswald of the 1920s to Bugs Bunny.
   ``There's an awful lot of Oswald in Roger,'' said Williams. ``He
has the little overalls, and he's a white rabbit. Oswald was
shorter, so we had to stretch him out. With the red overalls, white
rabbit and blue bow tie, he became like an American flag.''
   Originally, scenes including both humans and animated characters
were to occupy 40 minutes of the film. The final amount was 58 out
of the 103-minute running time.
   ``We knew we had to have great actors; that was the key to it,''
Zemeckis said. ``That's why it was important to cast someone like
Bob Hoskins, who is first and foremost a great actor. He had not
only to do his performance but simultaneously imagine the cartoon
performance, plus all the technical things: eye-lines, marks and
the pantomime that he had to do.''
   Hoskins was aided by Charles Fleischer, a stand-up comic who
played Roger Rabbit's voice.
   ``Charlie stood off-camera and gave me Roger's lines,'' said the
British actor. ``That was a big help. So was playing with those
little dolls they dreamed up.''
   Zemeckis provided the actors with character-size dolls to act
with, and had extensive storyboards to illustrate how the scenes
would look. At the end of each completed scene, another ``reference
take'' was filmed as an aid to animators who would draw in the
characters.
   The exterior live action of ``Roger Rabbit'' was filmed in Los
Angeles beginning in December 1986. Interior sets were built at
London's Elstree studio, many of them 10 feet off the stage floor
to accommodate puppeteers working with robot arms and wires.
Zemeckis edited the film scene by scene and handed the material
over to Williams and his animators.
   Previewers have marveled at how masterfully the live actors
combine with the cartoon figures.
   ``We did it by violating the rules,'' Williams explained.
``Fortunately I never knew the rules. ...
   ``The old way of doing it was to lock the camera and light the
live actors flat because the animation would be flat. Why? Just
before `Roger Rabbit,' I did a couple of Fanta soft drink
commercials for overseas, using Disney characters. I shot the live
action myself, running the camera through a bunch of kids playing
football. Then I animated Mickey and Donald running with the ball
through the kids' legs. It wasn't supposed to work, but it did.
Totally.
   ``It was a little more work to make the animated characters
compensate for the perspective. I told Bob just to shoot his scenes
with wide-angle cameras, and we'd just draw in the characters to
fit the space. We tried it and it worked 100 percent.''
   Having devoted three years of his life to ``Roger Rabbit,''
Zemeckis plans to vacation this summer. He plans to take his wife
and son to Hawaii and spend the rest of the time at home.
   His next movie?
   ``A nice film with live actors and no special effects,'' he said.

   Producer Steven Spielberg was able to land
Bugs Bunny, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Porky Pig and Daffy Duck,
but he couldn't get Popeye, Olive Oyl or Felix the Cat.
   It was all part of the difficult task of acquiring rights to
famous cartoon characters from five studios to appear in the movie,
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'' It's a cinematic first.
   ``I don't think anyone else in Hollywood except Steven Spielberg
could have done it,'' said director Robert Zemeckis.
   ``Because of the nature of the project and who was involved, it
wasn't as complicated as it might have been. Once we landed the
Warners characters (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig), everyone
else came on board.''
   Since Spielberg produced ``Goonies,'' ``The Color Purple'' and
other moneymakers for Warner Bros., getting Bugs Bunny and other
Warners cartoon stars into the fold was a relatively easy sell.
   The $40 million movie is a project from the Walt Disney Co.'s
Touchstone Pictures, so using the beloved Disney animated
characters was no problem. Spielberg is an executive producer.
   He was able to enlist Woody Woodpecker from Universal, Betty
Boop from Paramount and the MGM stable. But he hit a roadblock on
Popeye and Olive Oyl, who declined the project on orders from their
copyright owners, King Features. Spielberg also couldn't snare the
pioneering Felix, whose origins date to 1914.
   Contracts for use of the cartoon characters were voluminous.
   ``They are very important stars at their own studios,'' said
Zemeckis. ``(The companies) wanted to know who the animators would
be, and they supervised the designs. They really look out for those
characters.
   ``Naturally, they wanted to be sure their stars would not be
portrayed in anything derogatory, such as drug dealing. But of
course we would never do anything like that.''
   The major restriction on Disney was that the loan-out stars
could not be featured in advertising. They are included in the
film's credits, but cannot be used in commercials. Not to worry;
the studio has a few characters of its own to use.
   On the whole, ``the other studios were very cooperative, giving
us style sheets to guide our animators,'' said Richard Williams,
who directed the animation.
   ``But I had plenty of style sheets myself, having collected them
over the years from many different sources.''
   Not all the cartoon stars for which rights were obtained ended
up in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'': MGM's Tom and Jerry were
casualties of the cutting room.
   But at least 15 of them ended up with speaking parts, including
Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Sylvester, all
Mel Blanc's voice, and Betty Boop (Mae Questel), Yosemite Sam (Joe
Alaskey), Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine), Goofy (Tony Pope), Minnie
Mouse (Russi Taylor) and Pinocchio (Peter Westy).

<HEAD>Drug Trade, East-West Relations Expected to Be Discussed at Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At his final round of economic summitry,
President Reagan will challenge his colleagues to deny hijackers a
refuge and to make it harder for drug dealers to keep their
ill-gotten profits.
   Economic problems will be the primary focus as the leaders of
the world's seven industrial democracies gather this week in
Toronto.
   But as they have tended to do over the years, the leaders
probably will be looking to a number of other concerns, such as
international trouble spots and East-West relations in the wake of
the Moscow summit.
   Such topics usually come up over meals, when the leaders have a
chance to talk informally, officials say.
   Reagan, in a recent address sketching his goals for the summit,
said he will ask the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Italy,
Japan and West Germany to ``join together to attack the lifeblood
of one trade that should never be part of international trade _ the
international narcotics trade.''
   ``At this summit, we should join in a common offensive against
money laundering and the flow of drug profits through the world's
financial institutions,'' Reagan said. Through the so-called
practice of ``money laundering,'' drug dealers transfer their
illegal profits through legitimate banks.
   Secretary of State George Shultz has expressed hope the United
States will be able to enlist the leaders in ``a broad and
comprehensive effort'' on the problem.
   Shultz's top economics adviser, Undersecretary of State Allen
Wallis, said that he expected ``a general discussion of the whole
drug problem from beginning to end'' at the conference.
   Treasury Secretary James Baker III said that he hoped the summit
``could find a way to improve our cooperation'' on halting the
money laundering, as well as improving exchanges of intelligence
information to battle the drug problem.
   But for all the attention the issue may receive at the summit,
like many other matters, the outcome is uncertain.
   John D. Steinbruner, the director of foreign policy studies at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, said the drug issue ``is
emerging as the hottest immediate political topic, but nobody quite
knows what to do about it.''
   ``I think there will be a lot of debate, but not much
resolution,'' Steinbruner said.
   On a related subject, Shultz said he intended to use the summit
to discuss the drug trafficking of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who was indicted earlier this year in Florida on narcotics
charges. U.S. economic sanctions designed to help drive Noriega
from power have not borne fruit.
   Asked whether a new plan was in the works, Shultz said, ``We
don't have a new plan to get him out of Panama, but we can
certainly describe to (the leaders), and have, his association with
drug dealing and the great undesirability of having a person who is
that prominent in a country associated with drug dealing.''
   Terrorism is another topic expected to be discussed this week.
   At last year's Venice summit, the leaders basically reiterated a
statement, reached at the Tokyo summit in 1986, that condemns
states that deal with terrorists.
   But this time, Shultz said he expected the seven leaders to
exercise the ``no-place-to-hide'' doctrine and to call on all
countries around the world to deny fuel to airplane hijackers.
   The idea is to prevent hostage-holders from taking off with
their victims, Shultz said at a U.S. Information Agency telecast
and a White House briefing last week.
   ``It's a specific thing that if given broad endorsement might be
helpful,'' the secretary said.
   Shultz also predicted a serious discussion of a multilateral aid
package for the Philippines and said Western leaders were expected
to talk about assisting Afghan refugees who are attempting to
resettle in their nation as the Soviet invaders withdraw.
   Reagan, in his recent speech, discussed aid to restore the
economies of war-ravaged Afghanistan and the Philippines. But
Reagan said the Philippines need aid because of its ``communist-led
insurrection,'' and made no mention of the country's money woes in
the wake of the fall of longtime President Ferdinand Marcos.
   On South Africa, Shultz indicated that the United States would
resist any discussion of imposing stiffer economic sanctions on the
country that practices racial segregation.
   ``We don't see here in the United States that it is a good idea
to go further,'' Shultz said.
   Wallis of the State Department said the leaders also are
expected to quiz Reagan about his experiences from his meetings
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``They will want to sound out the president on his visit to
Moscow,'' the State Department official said.
   And if they have the time, the leaders are expected to try a
novel approach and talk about the future _ both about problems they
foresee and ways to deal with them.
   ``This is an experiment. We haven't done this before,'' Wallis
said, explaining that while summit planners have attempted to make
time for such a topic before, it has never been accomplished.

<HEAD>California Has Biggest Death Row, No Executions</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS lead to CORRECT that California does not have largest
death row population; SUBS graf 5, ``Throughout,'' to add sentence
explaining that California has largest death row among the 25
states which have not resumed executions</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than two decades, the gas
chamber at San Quentin prison has been idle while California built
up one of the nation's largest Death Row populations.
   For those 231 prisoners, all of them men, the countdown has
begun.
   ``The cases are moving along now,'' said Gary Mullen, executive
director of the California District Attorneys Association, the
state's foremost prosecutors' organization. ``We expect that in the
near future, probably before the end of the year, there will be a
death penalty case that will be cleared all the way through the
state Supreme Court.''
   ``There has been a dramatic change in the (state) court,'' adds
John Meehan, district attorney of Alameda County and one of the
state's foremost death penalty experts. ``An execution could occur
by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.''
   Throughout the nation, 100 people have been executed since the
U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty in
1976. So far, only 12 of the 37 states with capital punishment laws
have resumed executions. Of the 25 states which have not,
California has the largest death-row population.
   This year, the California Supreme Court reversed one of its most
important earlier rulings that impeded executions, declaring that a
killer can be put to death even if there was no intent to murder.
   The ruling marked a sharp departure from the philosophy of the
previous Supreme Court, dominated for a decade by the liberal
appointees of former Gov. Jerry Brown. His chief justice, Rose
Bird, was removed from office by voters in 1986 along with two
liberal colleagues.
   In one year, the new court under Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas has
affirmed more than a dozen death sentences, compared to four death
sentences affirmed during the 10-year tenure of the Bird court.
   The court now is controlled by a 5-2 majority appointed by
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who as a state senator sponsored
the 1977 death penalty act.
   Under California law, all death sentences are automatically
reviewed by the state Supreme Court. If the state high court
affirms the decision, the death sentence is appealed directly to
the U.S. Supreme Court, followed by a second round of challenges,
raising issues not addressed previously and often focusing on the
competency of the defendant's original attorney. The litigation
commonly takes years.
   ``There has been a dramatic turnaround,'' said Mullen. ``I think
the state Supreme Court has become more mainstream _ 80 percent of
Californians support the death penalty, according to polls.''
   ``The death penalty cases are speeding along,'' said Michael
Laurence, a San Francisco attorney who handles death penalty
appeals. ``It was difficult before, because you are working uphill
for a person who has already been convicted and sentenced to death.
Now, it's a little more difficult.''
   California's Legislature moved quickly to restore capital
punishment following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling that
permitted executions to resume.
   A narrow death penalty bill, sponsored by Deukmejian, was
approved by the Legislature in 1977 and vetoed by Brown. The
Legislature, for the first time, overrode Brown's veto.
   In November 1978, California voters approved a death penalty
initiative extending capital punishment to accomplices and other
types of murders not covered by Deukmejian's legislation. Most of
the controversial state Supreme Court rulings dealing with the
penalty have focused on the meaning and constitutionality of the
initiative.
   Depending upon the course of their respective court battles, the
next to die will probably be one of three killers: Robert Alton
Harris of San Diego, Stevie Lamar Fields of Los Angeles or Earl
Lloyd Jackson of Long Beach.
   ``They are regarded as the furthest along,'' said Bob Gore, a
spokesman for the state Corrections Department. ``As to which one
it will be, right now we can't say.''
   Prosecutors, led by Alameda County District Attorney John
Meehan, a death penalty expert, believe the most likely prospect is
Harris, who gunned down two teen-agers in north San Diego County
after stealing their car for a 1978 bank robbery. After the
killings, Harris calmly munched hamburgers he'd taken from his
victims, according to court testimony from an accomplice.
   Fields kidnapped, tortured, raped and killed a University of
Southern California librarian. Jackson raped and murdered two women
in their 80s on successive nights.
   Executions were common in California for more than a century,
with 502 people put to death, by rope or by gas, between 1851 and
1967.
   The last to die was Sacramento cop-killer Aaron Mitchell, who
was executed at San Quentin while Jerry Brown led a candlelight
vigil outside the prison. Ronald Reagan, then the state's governor,
and his clemency secretary, Edwin Meese III, declined to intervene
to block the execution.
   California's two most notorious killers _ cultist Charles Manson
and Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F. Kennedy _ are not on
death row, since their crimes occurred prior to 1972, when the
capital punishment statute was overturned.
   Perhaps the two most famous California executions were those of
Caryl Chessman and Barbara Graham.
   Chessman, the ``red light bandit'' who committed 17 crimes
during a 20-day Los Angeles spree in 1948, went to his death
smiling on May 5, 1960. A prolific author and jailhouse lawyer,
Chessman captured international attention as he evaded eight
execution dates. In 1961, the UCLA Law Review called Chessman's
court battle ``the most extensively litigated case in the annals of
American criminal law.''
   Chessman was executed for kidnapping and robbery, not murder.
Under current law, criminals can only be executed if the crime
involves a death.
   Graham, known in the press as ``Babs the Party Girl,'' was
executed in 1955 for the murder of an elderly invalid woman. Her
two accomplices were also put to death in a triple-execution day at
San Quentin.
   Graham's odyssey from petty theft to murder was depicted in the
1958 movie, ``I Want to Live,'' starring Susan Hayward. She won an
Oscar for the performance.

   Today is showdown day for Texaco Inc.
chieftains and Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, in
a proxy fight that could lead to the biggest corporate buyout in
American history.
   Icahn, holder of 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares, is
running with four allies for the five seats up for election to the
company's 14-member board. He hopes to pressure Texaco to let
stockholders vote on his offer to buy the Texaco shares he does not

   But the winner won't be known for weeks. It is expected to take

<HEAD>Khomeini Death Rumor Sparks Oil Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rumored death of Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has pushed oil futures prices sharply higher.
   The unconfirmed rumor, which circulated in the oil market late
Thursday, turned a thin, lackluster trading day into a rally,
observers said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, finished 13 cents
higher to settle at $16.66 per barrel. The contract lost 30 cents
on Wednesday and slipped as low as $16.30 before the Khomeini rumor
hit on Thursday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, near-term
contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline gained 0.96 cent a gallon
to 50.19 cents, and home heating oil advanced 0.70 cent to close at
44.12 cents a gallon. Both contracts had fallen along with crude in
the previous session.
   ``The feeling is that if and when he (Khomeini) dies, we'll
probably see some rapproachement between Iran and Iraq,'' said
Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc.
   The two nations have been at war for eight years, and Iraq has
refused to sign recent OPEC accords unless it is granted an oil
production quota equal to Iran's.

<TEXT>
   Sulzer Brothers Inc. of New York, a
subsidiary of the multinational Swiss medical supply company Sulzer
Brothers Ltd., has agreed to acquire Intermedics Inc. for $800
million in cash.
   A tender offer for the Angleton-based developer of implantable
medical devices was expected to commence next Tuesday, Peggy
O'Reilly, spokeswoman for Sulzer Brothers in New York, said
Thursday.
   Sulzer Brothers will begin a cash tender offer for all shares of
Intermedics at $43 per share and for all common stock purchase
rights warrants of Intermedics for $39.25 per warrant, Ms. O'Reilly
said.
   Sulzer Brothers Ltd., headquartered in Winterthur, Switzerland,
is a major supplier of orthopedic implants in Europe.
   Intermedics is a world-wide developer of implantable medical
devices including cardiac pacemakers, mechanical heart valve
components, orthopedic joints and dental implants.
   ``Intermedics fits very well into our growth strategy in the
U.S. medical technology market,'' said Othmar Hegi, executive
president of Sulzer Brothers Ltd. ``Their technology is excellent
and we are enthusiastic about their state-of-the-art products.''
   In its 1987 fiscal year ended Nov. 1, Intermedics reported net
earnings of $20.6 million, or $1.22 per share, on revenue of $193.3
million. For the first six months of its 1988 fiscal year ended May
1, the company reported earnings of $15.1 million, or 88 cents per
share, on revenue of $110.2 million.
   ``The acquisition by Sulzer comes at an appropriate time in the
growth cycle of our company,'' said Richard A. Gilleland, chairman
and chief executive officer of Intermedics. ``Intermedics has
positioned itself for strong growth and profitability in the global
market for medical devices, and our affiliation with Sulzer will
enhance that objective.''

<HEAD>Some Cattle Feeders See Possible Collapse of Market Due to Drought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock prices took some of their sharpest
downturns ever this week, in a trend that could continue until
drought conditions ease, according to beef industry sources.
   ``I'd say it's a complete collapse of the feeder cattle
market,'' said Omaha cattle feeder Bob Gottsch. ``Weather will be
the determining factor in the forseeable future.''
   ``It's just kind of panic selling. There's been some panic and
fear come back into the marketplace,'' Gottsch said Thursday.
   Gottsch and others in the industry said cattlemen fear that a
continued decline in prices _ combined with high grain prices
caused by drought conditions _ will erase their profits and begin
to cause losses.
   Cattle prices remain at near-record levels, $70 per 100 pounds.
But cattlemen's costs for feed are rising just as fast.
   ``If it doesn't rain for the next three weeks, I'd say prices
could go to $65 with a danger of $60 on fat cattle,'' Gottsch said.
Fat cattle are animals that have been fed and are ready for
slaughter at packing houses.
   Gottsch said corn prices, now $2.50 per bushel, may rise to $4
per bushel and soybeans may hit $12 to $15 per bushel, up from the
current $9. He said nearly all producers and feeders would lose
money on cattle at those prices.
   In direct sales to packing houses on Wednesday, prices paid to
eastern Nebraska cattle feeders for steers and heifers started the
day $1 lower and finished $2 to $3 lower, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture reported.
   It marked the sharpest one-day price decline ever, USDA
officials said.
   Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade for cattle futures declined
mostly by the $1.50-per-100-pounds limit Wednesday following
declines the last several days. Livestock and meat futures
rebounded slightly on Thursday, in what analysts deemed mainly a
technical rally.
   Jim Rodenburg, executive secretary of the Omaha Livestock
Exchange, called the recent trend a ``rapid downturn.''
   ``I'm not going to call it a collapse yet. This thing could find
a level to stabilize and then straighten up,'' he said. ``But it's
certainly been kind of a rapid downturn.''

domestic automakers to sell 15.6 million cars and trucks in the
United States by the end of 1988, more than a half million more
than last year.
   Ford increased its 1988 industry forecast for the second time
since the October stock market crash Earlier this year, Ford raised
its forecast to 15.3 million from a pre-crash 15 million, Robert
Rewey, Ford's vice president for North American sales said Thursday.
   ``The market is back. Consumer confidence is back. Interest
rates are flat, the trade deficit is down, unemployment is down,''
Rewey said. ``We're just looking at what we think the underlying
growth rate is.''
   Rewey said Ford increased its 1988 forecast of industry sales of
imported and domestic vehicles to 10.4 million cars and 5.2 million
trucks for the industry from 10.2 million cars and 5.1 million
light trucks.
   Before the stock market plunge, Ford had forecast industry sales
of 10 million cars and 5 million trucks.
   Total industry sales for 1987 were slightly more than 15
million, including heavy trucks. Sales of cars and light trucks
alone were 14.9 million. In the first quarter of 1988, industry
sales totaled more than 3.8 million cars and light trucks _ a
performance that surprised automakers and analysts.
   By the end of May, U.S. car and light truck sales had reached
nearly 6.6 million.
   Ford's new forecast includes heavy trucks, which comprise nearly
6 percent of all truck sales.
   Ford's main competitor, industry leader General Motors Corp., is
more vague about its forecast, but it also recently increased it _
to ``slightly more than 15 million ... from slightly less than 15
million,'' said GM spokesman Harold Jackson.
   The most recent forecast of Chrysler Corp., the nation's
third-largest automaker, is 15.1 million _ 10.1 million cars and 5
million trucks, said Steve Torok, Chrysler's director of sales
operations planning.
   Chrysler's first post-stock market crisis prediction was the
most pessimistic in the industry at 9.5 million cars and 4.7
million trucks. It was boosted in the first quarter to 9.8 million
cars and 4.8 million trucks.

   The president of First RepublicBank Dallas has
become the latest of several senior managers to leave the troubled
bank.
   John Stuart announced his resignation Thursday, effective July
15, saying he wanted to persue ``numerous business opportunities in
Dallas.''
   A bank spokesman said Albert Casey, chairman and first executive
officer of the parent First RepublicBank Corp. and the Dallas bank,
would assume the post until a replacement is selected.
   First RepublicBank is the largest bank in Texas with $16.6
billion in assets, but the bank has contributed a large portion of
the problem real estate loans that caused the parent company to
seek a $1 billion federal bailout earlier this year.
   Stuart served as director of the company's real estate section
since it was formed a year ago by the merger of RepublicBank Corp.
and InterFirst Corp.
   Stuart, 51, joined Republic Bank as a credit analyst in 1961,
rising to executive vice president in 1971. He managed the bank's
real estate department for more than 10 years and was managing
director of the energy banking group from 1982 to 1984. He later
served as managing director of the corporation's gneeral banking
group.
   Other executives who have recently left First RepublicBank
include Gerald Fronterhouse, the holding company's chairman and
chief executive, who resigned in April, and Charles Pistor, the
Dallas bank chairman, who resigned in April.

<HEAD>Revised Indictment Adds Credit-Card Fraud to Minkow's Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have revised their
charges against fallen carpet-cleaning whiz kid Barry Minkow by
filing a superseding indictment that adds conspiracy and
credit-card fraud counts to the original case.
   The revised 57-count indictment, filed Thursday, names the
22-year-old Minkow and three other defendants as participants in an
alleged conspiracy to commit securities fraud, obtain funds
fraudulently and falsify legal documents.
   The new indictment also alleges that Minkow's illegal conduct
began when the entrepreneur who founded the ZZZZ Best
carpet-cleaning empire was 18 years old _ at least two years
earlier than previously disclosed.
   An added count of credit card fraud alleges that as early as
October 1984, Minkow ``devised and participated in a scheme to
defraud by making unauthorized charges to credit-card numbers of
ZZZZ Best customers.''
   Minkow allegedly obtained more than $29,800 from 16 customers
through the credit-card scheme.
   Minkow's defense attorney, David Kenner, could not immediately
be reached for comment. But at a news conference a week ago, Kenner
declared that his client was a fall guy, ``nothing more than a
stepchild of organized crime.''
   A racketeering count, which carried a 20-year maximum sentence,
has been deleted from the new charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said the racketeering
count allowed federal authorities to seize Minkow's assets. But
Asperger said those assets have become tied up in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
   The prosecutor said the revised indictment increases the maximum
prison term Minkow faces, if convicted, from 350 years to 403 years.
   The original indictment, which was unsealed Jan. 15, charged
Minkow and 10 other defendants with 54 counts of bank fraud, money
laundering, tax fraud and racketeering. A 12th defendant was named
in a separate complaint.
   Most of the previously filed counts are included in the new
case, although all but the four remaining defendants have pleaded
guilty or are expected to do so before trial.
   Minkow founded his ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company in his
parents garage in suburban Reseda when he was just 15.
   Four years later, in 1985, he incorporated the business and the
ZZZZ Best Co. became a publicly traded firm in the over-the-counter
market in January 1986.
   However, the revised indictment alleges that as early as March
1985, Minkow and other defendants falsely claimed ZZZZ Best was
performing restoration work on buildings damaged by water, fire and
other causes.
   ``At its height, the restoration work purportedly comprised over
90 percent, or $43.7 million of ZZZZ Best's annual revenues,'' the
indictment states. ``In fact, ZZZZ Best performed virtually no
restoration work.''
   When accusations concerning the fraudulent nature of Minkow's
carpet restoration work began surfacing in May 1987, the indictment
alleges Minkow ``orchestrated a cover-up in which he recruited
various persons to lie to attorneys, accountants and others who
were investigating'' the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning company.

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines and a California company
plan next week to unveil a Boeing 747 jumbo jet equipped with
3-inch color TV sets fitted into the backs of 116 seats.
   Sheldon Presser, president of California-based Airvision Inc.,
said Thursday that passengers will be able to choose from six
programs on closed-circuit channels played via videocassette.
   The airline would not comment on the new television-equipped
aircraft except to say a news conference was scheduled Tuesday
aboard Observation Flight 5687 on a route over Canada. The airline
said it would tell reporters and photographers about ``an exciting
innovation in inflight entertainment.''
   The programs, Presser said, will include movies, sports, music,
news and, possibly, such programs as ``Night Court'' and
``Moonlighting.'' One channel will be devoted to foreign-language
programs, he said. Passengers will get the audio through earphones.
   Press said the installation is aimed primarily at testing the
system, developed with help from Warner Communications and Philips
N.V., a large Dutch electronics firm.
   Unlike traditional cathode-ray televisions, he said the airborne
sets have small liquid crystal display screens. ``It's really a new
business,'' he said.
   About 30 percent of the seats on the test aircraft will have the
television sets, both in first-class and coach areas.
   The programs will have commercials, Presser said, though
advertising rates have yet to be determined.

   A top administration official acknowledged
today that the United States is facing intense opposition in its
efforts to eliminate farm subsidies worldwide but he said the fact
the matter was even being discussed was encouraging.
   At the seven-nation economic summit, which begins Sunday in
Toronto, President Reagan will again propose an elimination of what
he calls the farms race, the $150 billion industrial countries are
spending every year to subsidize agricultural products.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said today in a broadcast
interview with foreign journalists that the farm subsidy issue
would receive a ``full-fledged'' discussion at the three-day summit.
   Baker said the United States hoped to receive a commitment from
the other countries to move forward with negotiations begun two
years ago as part of worldwide trade liberalization talks. He said
this would be similar to a pledge made last month by 24 industrial
countries at a Paris meeting.
   However, that statement was seen as a major defeat for the
United States delegation, led by Baker, because America had
originally wanted much tougher language committing the countries to
working for a specific date for the scrapping of subsidies.
   But Baker today disputed the contention that no progress had
been made in Paris.
   ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult
problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,'' he said in
an interview made available to overseas broadcasters by the U.S.
Information Agency.
   ``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating
subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all
able to go to our farmers and say the world is going to do this,''
he said.
   The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard
bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a
Montreal trade meeting in December.
   The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current
round of global trade talks which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay
and scheduled to end in 1990.
   The United States wants trade negotiators to prepare a detailed
outline at the Montreal meeting of what they intend to accomplish
between this year and the scheduled end of the Uruguay Round of
trade talks two years from now. The United States wants the outline
to state as a goal the phase out of subsidies by a date certain,
probably the year 2000.
   While this will be the U.S. stand in Toronto, it is likely that
the leaders will instead adopt a less ambitious statement similar
to one adopted last month at a Paris meeting of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation in which the summit countries pledged to
work for reduction of the subsidies rather than totally scrapping
them.
   All countries agree in principal that farm subsidies are a major
drain on their treasuries, but Europeans claim that political
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support
programs.
   Instead, they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidies
to a less costly level, perhaps one-half of where supports are
currently.
   ``President Reagan isn't going to be there to implement the
elimination of the subsidies, so he can hang tough. But other
foreign leaders, who may want to run for re-election again, see his
approach as far too radical,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research
organization.
   The battle over food subsidies has been a highly contentious
trade issue for several years as countries have waged costly
battles to support their own farmers.
   The food glut has occurred in part because of various advances
in developing new and improved crop strains which occurred as many
countries decided in the past two decades that they wanted to be
self-sufficient in farm production.
   Western Europe, the world's largest food importer in 1970, is
now second to the United States in the amount of food it exports.
   The United States is still the world's largest exporter of farm
commodities, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume of
wheat and feed grains sold on world markets. But since reaching a
record of $41.7 billion in 1981, U.S. farm exports steadily
declined for five years, falling to a low of $26.6 billion in 1986.
They posted a slight increase to $29 billion in 1987.
   With the drop in U.S. agricultural sales abroad has come a rise
in foreign farm shipments to this country. The traditional trade
surplus America runs in farm products has shrunk from $26.6 billion
in 1981 to just $6.5 billion last year.
   The Reagan administration's push to reduce farm subsidies
through trade negotiations has generated very little reaction among
farm lobbying groups in this country.
   A recent review of the situation by the General Accounting
Office said that many farm groups believe the U.S. proposal is a
good negotiating strategy but believe it is highly unrealistic to
think that countries would totally dismantle their domestic support
programs.
   But the issue is unlikely to go away because of the cost of the
programs in government spending and higher food prices to consumers.

<HEAD>Investors Give Way to `Asset Allocators'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The big game for money managers on Wall Street
these days is not investing, but something called ``asset
allocation.''
   This is not just the substitution of a fancy phrase for a simple
word to make the subject sound more elaborate.
   It is a different approach to the business of managing pension
funds and other large pools of money that comes close to the heart
of the recent debate over computerized ``program trading,'' the
collapse of stock prices last fall and the future of the market.
   To put it in simplest terms, asset allocation involves the
effort to spread and shift money among various categories of
investments for the greatest possible return.
   The three main categories of financial investments in the U.S.
markets are stocks, bonds and short term interest-bearing
securities, such as Treasury bills, that are known in Wall Street
parlance as ``cash.''
   The philosophy behind this, as described by the brokerage firm
of Kidder, Peabody & Co. in a treatise on ``our position on
financial market reform,'' is that ``the asset allocation decision,
the choice of the proportions of the portfolio to hold in stocks,
bonds or cash, is of greater importance than the stock selection
decision.
   ``These new asset allocation strategies ... consider the U.S.
equity market in aggregate.
   ``Active management is employed in shifts between stocks, bonds
and cash, but passive management may be used within each category
of assets.''
   Passive management means not trying to beat the performance of a
given market, but rather simply seeking to duplicate it.
   In the case of stocks, that may translate into buying a fund or
package of stocks set up to duplicate the performance of a market
index such as Standard & Poor's 500-stock composite index.
   When you get seriously into the process of asset allocation,
``program trades and stock index and bond index futures are the
mechanisms whereby exposure to each asset class are most easily
adjusted,'' Kidder Peabody said.
   What could be wrong with all this? Many pension managers,
sensibly enough, stopped trying to pick individual stocks when they
were confronted with studies showing they had little chance of
beating the market that way. They were just too big.
   Brokerage firms developed program trading, the index futures
strategy known as portfolio insurance, and other asset allocation
systems in large measure to try to meet the needs and desires of
those pension managers, who are some of the brokers' most important
customers.
   In addition, the growth of international investing has
contributed to the popularity of asset allocation and index
investing.
   As Kidder Peabody says: ``Many global investors view a country's
stock market as a single unit and prefer to trade it as such.
Buying and selling individual stock issues when an investment in a
foreign market is desired can be a very inefficient and costly
means of active international investing.''
   The problem some people have with all this is the lumping of all
stocks together as a single ``market'' that can be bought and sold,
making stocks no more distinguishable from one another than bushels
of corn or sheets of plywood.
   If everybody practices asset allocation and nobody cares about
individual corporate earnings or dividends, then the market would
logically stop fulfilling its role as a means of promoting and
rewarding business success.
   ``We are at the point that traditional equities investors will
capitulate control of the equities market to the futures traders,''
said William King at Nikko Securities International.
   Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. maintains:
``The function of financial markets is not to provide a private
hunting preserve where large institutions can get in or out quickly
with minimum costs.
   ``The real function of the markets is to raise necessary capital
and to allocate it in the most efficient, productive way. And there
the markets are failing badly.''

   The stock market moved higher early today in
heavy trading after tumbling in the previous session on fears of
higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 37 points
on Thursday, was up 6.93 points at 2,101.17 in the first half hour
of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.03 million shares. Gainers
led losers by about 11 to 7 with 674 up, 444 down and 520 unchanged
as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders kept a sharp eye on the credit markets, where sharply
lower bond prices helped trigger Thursday's decline in stock prices.
   Rumors that West Germany and possibly Japan might be preparing
to hike interest rates sparked fear that the Federal Reserve might
be pressed to do the same to support the dollar.
   ``The bond market could drag us down again today like it did
yesterday,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Traders steadied themselves for the year's second
``triple-witching hour,'' in which groups of stock-index futures,
stock-index options and options on individual stocks will expire
today.
   ``There's some nervousness,'' Vandenberg said, ``but the last
few expirations have been orderly, with no major problems.''
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was unchanged at 49{, IBM
was up [ at 117\, Ford Motor was unchanged at 52[, and General
Electric was unchanged at 43\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.30 at 152.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.40 at 306.67.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 37.16
points to close at 2,094.24. Declining issues outnumbered advances
by about 5 to 2 on the NYSE, with 435 up, 1,089 down and 425
unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 161.55 million shares, against
150.26 million shares in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Fourteen Arab air carriers and five financial
institutions have agreed to form a consortium to purchase up to 220
new planes, the chairman of the Kuwait Airways Corporation said.
   Ahmed Mishari said Thursday that studies by the consortium show
a need for the aircraft by the year 1995.
   Mishari, who also chairs the project's steering committee, said
the consortium will be named the Arab Aviation Finance Company and
will be formally inaugurated in 1989.
   In an interview, he said the group was in the process of
selecting a consulting firm to conduct a feasibility study for the
purchases, which could cost up to $10 billion.
   Aviation sources who declined to be identified by name said most
of Arab aircraft purchases in the coming decade would be from
Boeing Co. and the European Airbus consortium.
   In addition to Mishari, steering committee members include the
chairmen of the national airlines of Jordan and Morocco, the
secretary-general of the Arab Air Carriers Organization and
representatives of five banking establishments.
   They are the National Bank of Kuwait, the International Gulf
Bank, the Gulf Investment Establishment, the Arab Banking
Establishment and the Arab Bank for International Investment.
   Mishari said 50 of the new aircraft will be needed to meet
expansion plans while the other 170 planes will replace aging
aircraft.
   Mishari said that the venture was prompted in large part by the
aggressiveness of foreign airlines that sought to control the Arab
market.

   Housing construction plummeted 12.2 percent in
May, the steepest drop in five months, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the drop dragged construction
activity down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million
units in May, the lowest level since January, when 2,000 fewer
units were begun.
   It was the steepest drop since December, when starts plunged
15.8 percent. They had fallen again in January, by 1.2 percent,
before posting increases of 9.9 percent, 0.7 percent and 3.1
percent in February, March and April, respectively.
   The huge May decline suprised analysts, who had been expecting
only a modest decline because of rising mortgage interest rates.
   Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages climbed from 10.05
percent at the start of April to 10.58 percent at the end of May,
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. They eased
slightly in the first weeks of June.
   However, some analysts had said the growing popularity of
adjustable rate mortgages would curb the effect of rising long-term
rates. An increase of a half percentage point, from 10.0 percent to
10.5 percent, would boost a homebuyer's monthly payment on a
30-year, $100,000 mortgage by about $37.
   Economists watch housing activity closely because it is often a
harbringer of the direction of the economy as a whole. However,
they cautioned against overreacting to one month's report.
   ``If we got two, three, four months of back-to-back declines,
then it would give plenty of reason for concern ... because a
pretty big size slice of the economy is tied to housing,'' said
John Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., forecasting service. ``I expect to see some sort of recovery
in June and July.''
   Construction of single-family homes dropped 9.2 percent in May
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 988,000. That followed a
7.2 percent decline. Single-family starts have not been lower since
August 1984, when they totaled 967,000 on an annual basis.
   Construction of multi-unit dwellings toppled 18.9 percent to a
seasonally adjusted rate of 396,000 units in May following a big
36.7 percent advance in April. This sector has been in the doldrums
for more than a year because of high vacancy rates and changes in
the tax law that made investment in rental housing less profitable.
   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future construction
activity, declined 1.5 percent in May, following a 1.8 percent
decline in April.
   The precipitous May drop was led by identical 22.3 percent drops
in the Northeast, where construction of housing was begun at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 206,000, and the Midwest, where
homes were started at a 269,000 yearly rate.
   It was the lowest level of construction activity in the
Northeast since September 1984, when the rate was 203,000, and the
steepest drop since the 24 percent plunge of November 1985.
   Starts in the South dropped 6.4 pecent to 555,000 and starts in
the West fell 4.8 percent to 354,000.

   A number of smokestack stocks are basking in the
spotlight these days, having edged out sleeker, consumer-oriented
issues in the quest for Wall Street's favor.
   The shift in investor focus from consumer product stocks to more
industrial equities has been building for several years, but
analysts say it has intensified since the market collapsed last
October.
   Indeed, a number of companies once relegated to the proverbial
Rust Belt have outperformed higher-profile conglomerates that make
identifiable, fast-selling products.
   For example, Colgate-Palmolive Co., maker of toothpaste, pet
food and detergents, was trading at about $23 a share at its
post-crash low. It currently is holding at about the $44-a-share
level, still shy of its pre-crash October peak of $50.
   Farm equipment maker Deere & Co.'s performance, on the other
hand, is far more impressive. Deere recently has traded in the
$50-a-share range, far beyond its post-crash low of $23 as well as
its October peak of $40 a share.
   While Colgate's advance appeared stalled, Deere's ``has been
very dynamic _ a steady rise that is characteristic of a powerful
technical advance,'' said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
   Analysts say the stark measures many heavy industries took over
the years _ from layoffs to paring of businesses to automation _
are starting to pay off.
   ``They have become lean, green, money machines, and there isn't
too much waste anymore,'' one trader said. To be sure, the
belt-tightening measures have made many companies far more
resistant to economic cycles than they were a decade ago.
   And investors are sensitive to their new strength. Individuals
are witnessing first hand the revitalization of industry.
   ``They are seeing some businesses hiring back workers, factories
expanding,'' Peroni said.
   Consumer-oriented companies themselves are not entirely in the
doldrums, although debt-laden Americans have been cutting back on
spending as lackluster retail sales attest.
   But these stocks are suffering from some neglect, as any
increased focus on the industrial sector must come at the expense
of something else.
   ``Traders are seeking out opportunities that are undervalued,
and there's recognition of the Rust-Belt companies. There is a
certain charm and interest there, since they are perceived as the
nation's historic backbone,'' Peroni said.
   To pair two other unlikely bedfellows, Bethlehem Steel Corp. has
managed to outperform Bristol-Myers Co., maker of Clairol hair
products, Excedrin and other products.
   Bristol-Myers stock has recovered from a post-crash low of about
$29 a share to about $42 of late, which is still below its October
peak of $53.
   Bethlehem Steel, however, is trading at about $21 a share, above
its October peak of $19 and more than double its post-crash low of
$10 a share.
   Analysts are divided as to whether the new focus actually spells
good things for the economy. Some say that expansion in the
industrial sector could be viewed as inflationary, as both factory
utilization and employment increase.
   As the November election nears, analysts say the presidential
candidates are likely to tout the recovery of basic industry.
   ``It's going to become prevalent to the public that we pulled
ourselves out of complete deterioration in the industrialized
world,'' one trader said.
   It is not likely to be made apparent, however, that this new
strength carries its own price.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Down, Factory Use and Inventories Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 2nd graf to show starts at lowest level since
January, sted December.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction tumbled 12.2 percent in May for the
steepest drop in five months, the government said today in a report
that suggested rising interest rates have jolted the home-building
business.
   The drop dragged construction activity down to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.38 million units in May, the lowest level
since January, when 2,000 fewer units were begun, the Commerce
Department said. It was also the steepest drop since December, when
starts plunged 15.8 percent.
   The housing report showed how sensitive the home construction
industry is to interest rates, which rose sharply in recent months.
Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed from 10.05 percent at
the start of April to 10.58 percent at the end of May, according to
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Although the housing report suggested economic weakness, it
added confusion to other statistics released Thursday that
indicated no clear trend.
   A report by the Federal Reserve Board said U.S. factories, mines
and utilities operated at 82.9 percent of capacity last month, a
0.2 percentage point increase over April. It was the sixth increase
in eight months and the highest operating level since March 1980
when the rate hit 83.7 percent.
   Some economists expressed concern that the trend will push
prices higher as manufacturers have difficulty producing enough to
meet demand. But others say the May report is good news, because
operating rates cooled in the hottest industries and increased in
sectors with excess capacity.
   A separate report Thursday by the Commerce Department showed
business inventories rose 0.5 percent in April, signaling slower
economic growth for the second quarter. Business sales fell 0.2
percent in the same month.
   Economists generally take rising inventories as a sign that
buying demand is declining and as an indication that manufacturers
may have to reduce production. But the report of higher factory
utilization rates, as well as other recent evidence of economic
strength, suggested no significant slowdown.
   Financial markets largely ignored the government reports
Thursday, focusing instead on the inflationary impact of an
agricultural drought that could raise food prices later this year.
   Severely dry weather in the farm states caused prices of corn,
soybean and oat futures to soar on the Chicago commodity exchanges,
which in turn incited runups in livestock and meat futures.
   There also was concern among stock and bond investors that
foreign banks might raise interest rates, which could intensify
pressure for higher rates in this country.
   In the bond market, a key barometer of inflation and
interest-rate trends, the 30-year Treasury issue dropped $12.50 per
$1,000 in face amount, and its yield jumped to 8.94 percent from
8.83 percent late Wednesday.
   The bond selloff spread to Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials fell 37.16 points after rising 32 points
in the prior two trading days. Broader market indexes also fell.
   On foreign exchange markets, the dollar declined against most
key currencies, in response to the speculation of higher foreign
interest rates.

   The top trade official of the European
Economic Community on Friday accused the U.S. government of using
``confrontational tactics'' in trans-Atlantic trade policy talks.
   Willy De Clercq, the EEC external affairs commissioner, told the
European Parliament that the United States had become less
cooperative on trade issues.
   ``The willingness of the United States to find negotiated
solutions is diminishing,'' he said. ``Instead, they are trying to
obtain satisfaction on a number of issues through confrontational
tactics.''
   De Clercq said the EEC, or Common Market, was willing to
continue discussing trade matters with the U.S. government. ``But
it must be in a spirit of cooperation and not one of
confrontation,'' he said.
   De Clercq gave no examples of the tactics he ascribed to
Washington, but he recently has complained about a U.S. decision to
reduce the amount of farmland held out of production. The EEC
claims this move is likely to increase U.S. crop production at a
time of global surpluses.
   The EEC also has strongly objected to U.S. complaints that its
subsidies to soybean producers and processors are hurting American
soybean exports to Western Europe. On Thursday, the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which sets and monitors
world trade rules, accepted a U.S. request to establish a special
committee to hear the complaint.
   U.S.-European trade relations are expected to be one of the
topics at the Toronto summit meeting of leaders from the seven
largest industrialized nations that begins Sunday.
   De Clercq's comments were in response to a European Parliament
report that urged action to strengthen GATT procedures for settling
trade disputes.
   In another sign of trade trouble, the EEC said Friday it would
impose punitive duties of up to 28 percent on a range of polyester
products imported from the United States and six other countries.
   The action is in response to a yearlong EEC inquiry that
concluded polyester producers in these countries were selling their
products in the Community at prices below the cost of production.
   The EEC decided to impose duties ranging between 2.5 percent to
28 percent on imports of various polyester fibers imported from the
United States, Mexico, Romania, Taiwan, Turkey and Yugoslavia.
Duties of between 2.7 percent and 26 percent will be charged on
polyester yarns imported from Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan and
Turkey.
   The share of the EEC polyester fiber market held by companies in
these seven countries grew from 9.6 percent in 1984 to 17.8 percent
last year, the EEC said.

   The stock market moved higher today in extremely
heavy trading attributed to the year's second ``triple-witching
hour,'' the expiration of futures and options.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 37 points
on Thursday, was up 7.29 points at 2,101.53 in the first hour and a
half of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 223.07 million shares. Gainers
led losers by about 11 to 8 with 712 up, 529 down and 536 unchanged
as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders said volume was typically very heavy as the
triple-witching hour got underway. Some stock-index contracts
expired at the opening, while others will expire at the close of
trading.
   ``There's some nervousness,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``But the last few expirations
have been orderly, with no major problems.''
   Despite the heavy volume, stock prices held in a narrow range.
   Traders kept a sharp eye on the credit markets, where severely
depressed bond prices helped trigger Thursday's decline in stock
prices.
   Rumors that West Germany and possibly Japan might be preparing
to hike interest rates sparked fear that the Federal Reserve might
be pressed to do the same to support the dollar.
   ``The bond market could drag us down again today like it did
yesterday,'' Vandenber said.
   Occidental Petroleum accounted for almost half of the early
volume, down [ at 26|, with more than 103 million shares changing
hands. Much of the activity was related to the company's impending
quarterly dividend.
   Elsewhere, Texaco was up \ at 49}. The oil giant today holds its
annual meeting, where Carl Icahn will wage a proxy battle.
   IBM was unchanged at 117[, Smithkline Beckman was off 1 at 44},
and General Electric was up [ at 43].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.36 at 152.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.06 at 307.01.

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter
announced today he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal
may be near on ending that nation's restrictions on beef imports.
   ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I'm
persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a
trip,'' the nation's top trade negotiator told reporters.
   A day earlier, Yeutter had said he would go to Tokyo ``only if
it becomes apparent to me that we have a settlement in sight.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``we remain
hopeful. ... Until there's a deal, there's no deal.''
   A previous agreement between the two countries that permitted a
Japanese quota of 214,000 tons of beef imports annually expired
April 1 and negotiations had been deadlocked since then.
   The United States insisted on an end to quotas also applying to
citrus products and sought to have the matter resolved under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But Japan vetoed such a
procedure.
   The overall value of the Japanese beef market has been placed at
$2 billion by the Department of Agriculture.
   Yeutter's office announced the trip early today to reporters
attending an international business breakfast at which the trade
representative was the featured speaker. He elaborated when an
Australian questioner asked what he could to do to help tame U.S.
farm lobbies that have frustrated Australian exporters.
   ``Within the next 72 hours or so I hope that our Australian
friends will say good things about what we've been doing with
regard to the beef situation and Japan,'' Yeutter said. `` ... So
to our Aussie friends I would say, this is an opportunity to
freeload _ so enjoy it.''
   He said later that by ``freeload'' he meant compete with
American beef exporters in a newly opened Japanese market.
   ``That's assuming we reach an agreement,'' Yeutter said.
   He said he did not want to discuss the details of whatever
preliminaries have been resolved at this point. There has been
speculation on Capitol Hill about a possible multi-year phaseout of
quotas accompanied by tariffs. But Yeutter said nothing of such
specifics.

<TEXT>
   More than most lawsuits, the landmark
Cipollone cigarette liability case seemed to rest mainly on how the
questions were framed than on positions the lawyers argued.
   The question asked by the cigarette makers was, Should a company
really be forced to pay money because a smoker contracted lung
cancer when she knew people were saying cigarettes were dangerous?
   Attorneys for Rose Cipollone, who died in 1984 at 58 after four
decades of smoking, put it another way: Shouldn't the makers of her
cigarettes be held responsible for their actions in making a
potentially dangerous product?
   And the 4{-month trial, which ended Monday with the first
liability finding against the industry, posed a broader question:
Is the courtroom the place to change public policy?
   The verdict reached by a jury of six New Jersey people seemed to
answer none of those questions.
   The panel cleared Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip
Morris Inc. of conspiring to misrepresent the dangers of smoking.
But it granted $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone in finding that
Liggett, which made the cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked before
warning labels were put on packs in 1966, violated advertising
promises that its products were safe.
   However, it answered ``none'' to the jury-sheet question of what
damages Mrs. Cipollone sustained.
   The jury also partly found against Liggett on a failure-to-warn
claim, determining the company should have told consumers of
smoking's risks before 1966, that the omission contributed to Mrs.
Cipollone's smoking and that the smoking contributed to her death.
   Yet the panel said Mrs. Cipollone was mostly responsible for her
injuries and thus not entitled to damages.
   Aside from the industry's exoneration on the fraud conspiracy
claim, company lawyers said they essentially won the case because
the jury found Mrs. Cipollone responsible for her injuries,
supporting the classic industry argument that smokers make an
independent, intelligent choice to puff on cigarettes.
   But Cipollone's lawyers said the verdict supported the charge
that smoking causes cancer _ which the industry denies has been
proven _ and that actions by a cigarette maker can be blamed for a
smoker's disease.
   Industry victory proclamations caused some skepticism in
anti-smoking ranks.
   ``To me, it seems like the captain of the Titanic saying, `Just
a little ice, folks,''' said Don Davis, an Austin, Texas, attorney
whose firm handles cigarette liability cases.
   The verdict led both sides to promise an appeal. They will have
until June 29 to file post-trial motions with U.S. District Judge
H. Lee Sarokin, with oral arguments expected toward the end of
July. The outcome will shape arguments in appeals courts.
   A different court _ the often cited court of public opinion _
must wrestle, meanwhile, with the significance of the Cipollone
verdict and all other cases like it.
   Anti-smoking advocates see liability cases as a way of reducing
the number of smokers, raising the price of cigarettes through
mounting industry legal bills and drumming up public opinion
against cigarettes. But others don't see that as the role of the
courts.
   ``I'm not a big fan of getting social reform by litigation,''
said Boris Yavitz, a Columbia University business school professor
with a chair in business ethics.
   A jury ``rules in favor of a plaintiff or defendant, but doesn't
rule on the issue involved,'' he said.
   Consensus on rules of a society should be reached first through
public debate and the actions of elected officials, and the courts
should then enforce compliance with what is decided, in Yavitz'
view.
   But the courts have often been put to good use for important
causes, said John F. Banzhaf, a George Washington University law
professor and anti-smoking activist.
   Environmental protection and rights for minorities, prisoners
and women have been won and maintained in courtrooms, he said.
   The courtroom also removes the advantages of lobbyists and
influence of a powerful institution.
   ``From the point of view of an activist, which I am, there are a
number of forums and you use all of them,'' he said.
   Cigarette liability trials, with an individual victim and
testimony from bereaved family members, have a way of personalizing
the statistics about smoking's casualties, in his view.
   A momentous verdict, like in the Cipollone case, sparks the
attention of legislators. And an anti-industry verdict will spawn
more filings, spreading the industry's legal resources thin and
creating more opportunity for errors by industry lawyers, Banzhaf
contended.

   The dimensions of the Pentagon procurement
bribery scandal are ``beyond the wildest imagination,'' Sen.
Charles Grassley said today, while another senator called the probe
the ``most serious case in the history of the Department of
Defense.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said he anticipates indictments
within 90 days in the massive criminal investigation of the alleged
sale of confidential Pentagon information to defense contractors
through their paid consultants.
   ``It involves people enriching themselves on propriety
information and the scope is beyond the wildest imagination,'' said
Grassley, who was briefed Thursday by Henry Hudson, the U.S.
attorney for the eastern district of Virginia and the coordinator
of the massive investigation.
   Grassley, R-Iowa, called for more vigorous enforcement of
antifraud laws and for the use of regional task forces of federal
prosecutors to fight white-collar crime in concentrated defense
industry areas such as southern California and Texas.
   Sen. John Warner, a former Navy secretary and the ranking
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was
briefed Thursday by federal law enforcement officials about the
case, which is focusing on the alleged sale of secret information
to defense contractors through their paid consultants.
   Warner, R-Va., said on CBS-TV's ``This Morning,'' that it was
``the most widespread case I or anyone else has ever seen because
you've got literally dozens upon dozens of contractors ... and
literally hundreds and hundreds of people are now being
subpoenaed.''
   ``It is the most serious case in the history of the Department
of Defense ... it is widespread and it is deep,'' Warner said.
   An unusually detailed search warrant, made public Thursday, says
much of the confidential information was improperly funneled to
McDonnell Douglas Corp. The warrant was one of 38 served this week
on 15 defense contractors, half a dozen Pentagon personnel and
consultants.
   According to the warrant, information was passed along by former
Pentagon official Melvyn Paisley, assistant secretary of the Navy
for research, engineering and systems from 1981 to April 1987.
Paisley is now a Washington consultant to numerous defense
contractors.
   McDonnell Douglas did $7.7 billion worth of Pentagon business in
fiscal 1987, making it the nation's largest defense contractor. The
warrant says McDonnell Douglas received confidential information on
several Pentagon programs including the $35 billion Advanced
Tactical Aircraft manufacturing competition won by the St. Louis
company.
   Paisley's consulting office was bugged and his phone there was
tapped by federal investigators conducting the corruption probe,
according to government sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Sources said Paisley is a consultant for United Technologies,
whose Washington offices also were searched Tuesday by FBI agents.
The agents took away all documents in United Technologies's files
relating to Paisley, said the sources.
   The agents also took documents relating to the 404 and T-406
engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies' subsidiary.
Paisley began working as a United Technologies consultant within a
week after he left his Pentagon job last year, according to the
sources.
   Meese declined to give a direct answer when asked if bribes had
been accepted in the Pentagon, saying ``that will all come out in
the course of the indictments and ultimately in the trials.'' He
said ``we are hopeful that indictments will be completed within the
next 30 to 90 days.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described President
Reagan as ``very concerned'' about the revelations after a meeting
tht included the president, Vice President George Bush, Meese and
FBI Director William Sessions.
   In other developments:
   _The New York Times, citing unidentified legal sources at the
Justice Department and elsewhere, reported today that the offices
of at least three House members had been placed under investigation
as part of the probe. The sources would not identify the lawmakers
or say whether the House members or their aides were under
investigation.
   _The Los Angeles Times reported today that Rep. Bill Chappell
Jr., D-Fla., who oversees the Pentagon budget as chairman of the
House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, was identified by
sources as one of those under scrutiny.
   Asked today if he is under investigation, Chappell said, ``It's
a bunch of bunk.'' He said there was ``all kinds of wild rumors
flying'' which he attributed to election season.
   Chappell said he didn't know if is telephone was tapped.
   _NBC News reported Thursday that the court-authorized wiretaps
lasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4,800 conversations, of which
671 were considered incriminating.
   _The Washington Post, citing an unidentified law enforcement
source, reported today that at least 12 phones had been tapped,
including that of William Galvin, a colleague of Paisley's and a
consultant associated with several defense contractors.
   The source also said one government employee received more than
$100,000 in cash in return for information, and that investigators
also were looking into allegations that personal bills, vacations
and other expenses of government employees were paid by
consultants, the newspaper reported.
   According to the McDonnell Douglas warrant, Paisley provided
``classified and-or confidential'' documents to company executives
including marketing vice president Thomas Gunn, said the warrant.
It said the documents included information on the F-16 fighter
plane manufactured by McDonnell Douglas competitor General Dynamics
Corp.
   The search warrant also sought documents about Paisley's
business relationships with McDonnell Douglas executives Bob Hood,
Bob Little, Jim Caldwell ``and others'' at the company from
November 1981 through 1988. Hood is vice president of aerospace
business development. Little is vice chairman of the board for
government business. Caldwell is vice president for international
marketing at McDonnell Aircraft Co.
   The warrant also said Paisley passed to McDonnell Douglas
``classified and-or confidential'' information or data ``not
available to the contracting public'' concerning:
   _A development plan with the French government regarding an
updated F-18 aircraft. The information included an internal Navy
study.
   _The sale of F-18s to Korea, including the names of individuals
with ability to influence the U.S. government to approve such sales.
   _The sale of F-18s to Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Friday by the Supreme Court.
   
   NEWSRACKS
   
   The court, striking down an ordinance from the Cleveland suburb
of Lakewood, Ohio, limited communities' power to regulate the
placement of newspaper boxes on public sidewalks.
   The court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled that the Lakewood ordinance
violated free-speech rights because it vested the mayor with too
much discretion in deciding which boxes would be allowed.
   The case is Lakewood vs. Plain Dealer, 86-1042.
   
   GARNISH
   
   The court made it easier for creditors to garnish employee
benefits from workers covered by the federal Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA).
   By a 5-4 vote in a case from Georgia, the court said ERISA
benefits are not shielded from garnishment even when a state law
seeks to protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors.
   The case is Mackey vs. Lanier Collection Agency, 86-1387.
   
   M-16
   
   The court resolved what it called ``a peculiar battle'' between
two federal appeals courts, telling one of those courts to tackle
an antitrust dispute over the M-16, the U.S. military standard
rifle.
   The justices unanimously ruled that the Chicago-based 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals should rule in the case, not the
Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
   The case is Christianson vs. Colt Industries, 87-499.
   
   SUING DEADLINE
   
   The court struck down an Ohio law that exempted from any
deadlines the filing of lawsuits against out-of-state defendants.
   The court, by an 8-1 vote, ruled that the law unduly interfered
with interstate commerce.
   The case is Bendix Autolite vs. Midwesco Enterprises, 87-367.

   Texaco Inc.'s annual meeting drew a packed
house today as a closely watched proxy war between the nation's
third largest oil company and financier Carl C. Icahn came to a
close.
   Stakes were high in the meeting, called to order by Texaco
Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., who told shareholders the company
was aggressively restructuring to put its legal and bankruptcy
ordeals into the past.
   ``The bottom line of all of this is we're reshaping your company
as reflected in Texaco's new advertising theme, `Up ahead there's
Texaco, star of the American road,''' DeCrane said. ``That theme
expresses what we intend to be in this industry.''
   Later, DeCrane cut off Icahn when the financier ran past his
10-minute speaking limit, and Icahn responded, ``I think this is a
manifestation of the inflexibility that caused Texaco its
problems.'' The crowd of more than 1,000 responded with a mixture
of scattered boos and cheers.
   After months of invective, lawsuits, charges and
counter-charges, shareholders have cast millions of votes on
whether to support management or Icahn, Texaco's largest
stockholder who has offered to acquire the company in the biggest
corporate buyout in American history.
   Results will not be known for weeks, because it will take that
long to count the proxy ballots.
   Icahn, holder of 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243 million shares,
was running with four allies for the five seats up for election to
the company's 14-member board.
   He seeks the seats to pressure the company to let stockholders
vote on his offer to buy the Texaco shares he does not already own
for $60 each, or about $12.4 billion. Adding the $1.2 billion he
already paid for his stake would raise the acquisition cost to
$13.6 billion, the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate buyout.
   After nearly four weeks of voting, the race widely was believed
to be close.
   Several major institutions were reported to have sided with
Icahn, while others were said to be leaning toward Texaco.
Traditionally, individuals tend to vote for management, but various
sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time.
   Texaco President James W. Kinnear and other top executives
plannedto address shareholders, company spokesman K. Peter Maneri
said, adding: ``Certainly Mr. Icahn, as the largest shareholder,
will also have a chance to speak.''
   Icahn said previously that if he lost, he would sell his stake
and ``go away,'' but he in recent days he also said he might try a
hostile takeover bid.
   Texaco and Icahn each have lawsuits pending against the other
and have engaged in months of verbal warfare, Texaco being
ever-mindful of Icahn's long record as a successful corporate
takeover strategist.
   Icahn began buying up Texaco shares last fall, while the company
was struggling to overcome a $10.3 billion judgment won by Pennzoil
Co. in a court fight over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil Co. The
ruling ultimately led to Texaco's filing for bankruptcy court
reorganization in April 1987.
   Pennzoil agreed in December to settle the case for $3 billion in
a deal that was the keystone of the Texaco reorganization plan
ultimately approved by the court in April.
   Texaco officials, calling for shareholder support, touted the
plan as the vehicle for a ``new'' more profitable Texaco to come.
   Icahn accused Texaco management of incompetence, charging it was
seeking to entrench itself, while ignoring the interests of its
shareholders.
   In response, management accused him of looking out only for his
own interests _ at the expense of other shareholders _ and of
seeking to bleed the company for the highest short-term profit
possible.
   Icahn gained some support from stockholders in his fight.
   As a result, Texaco agreed to include a vote on certain
``corporate governance'' issues on the proxy ballot, including,
among others, restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses, an
anti-greenmail provision and more participation by shareholders in
choosing directors.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier To Garnish Some Employee Benefits in Georgia
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
creditors to garnish employee benefits from workers covered by the
federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
   By a 5-4 vote in a case from Georgia, the court said ERISA
benefits are not shielded from garnishment even when a state law
seeks to protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors.
   Justice Byron R. White, in his opinion for the court, said ERISA
pre-empts state laws in such cases.
   The court ruled in favor of the Lanier Collection Agency &
Service, which represents people owed money by 23 longshoremen.
   The longshoremen received vacation and holiday benefits from the
South Atlantic@ILA Vacation and Holiday Fund. The fund provides
benefits to longshoremen in North and South Carolina, Georgia and
Florida.
   A Georgia law exempts from garnishment most benefits covered by
ERISA plans.
   But the Supreme Court said the state law conflicts with ERISA
and is pre-empted by the federal law.
   The decision upheld a ruling by the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Dissenting today were Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Harry A.
Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   The case is Mackey vs. Lanier Collection Agency, 86-1387.

<HEAD>Court Limits Power to Regulate Newspaper Box Placement in Ohio
Case</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court, striking down an ordinance
from the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, Ohio, today limited
communities' power to regulate the placement of newspaper boxes on
public sidewalks.
   The court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled that the Lakewood ordinance
violated free-speech rights because it vested the mayor with too
much discretion in deciding which boxes would be allowed.
   The ordinance empowered the city's mayor to grant or deny
applications for annual permits to publishers to place the boxes,
called newsracks, on public property.
   The Supreme Court's decision dealt only with the mayoral
discretion. It sent the case back to lower courts to determine
whether the ordinance, which also attached other conditions on the
placement of newsracks, could survive constitutional attack if the
mayoral discretion is dropped.
   Writing for the court, Justice William J. Brennan said the
ordinance could allow a mayor to deny permits based on a
newspaper's content.
   ``A law or policy permitting communication in a certain manner
for some but not for others raises the specter of content and
viewpoint censorship,'' Brennan said.
   Significantly, the court agreed with the American Newspaper
Publishers Association and numerous publishing companies that
placing newspaper boxes is a form of communication in a public
forum.
   A host of local government organizations had contended that no
free-speech questions existed in the case. They said various
conditions should be attached to the property rights created when a
newspaper is allowed to place a newsrack on public property.
   The Lakewood controversy began in 1982, when The Plain Dealer, a
Cleveland newspaper, sought permission to place coin-operated
newsracks in various locations in the community of about 62,000
residents.
   The request was turned down in its entirety, and the newspaper
subsequently sued the city.
   A federal judge ruled that the ordinance, as amended, was valid.
But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated three parts,
ruling:
   _That the ordinance impermissibly gave the mayor ``unlimited
discretion to grant or deny a permit and make it subject to almost
any conditions he may choose.''
   _That the city's architectural board of review had
``standardless discretion to approve the design of newsracks'' even
when such authority was ``not narrowly tailored to serve a
significant governmental interest.''
   _That the newspaper could not be forced to insure and indemnify
the city for personal-injury liability that might result from
accidents involving newsracks because no such insurance is required
for bus shelters or telephone booths.
   The appeals court, however, ruled that Lakewood could charge
rent for newsracks placed on public property. And it said the city
could ban newsracks from residential neighborhoods.
   About 5 percent of The Plain Dealer's total sales come from
newsracks. The bulk of the newspaper's sales come from home
delivery.
   Brennan's opinion was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and Antonin Scalia.
   Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy did not participate.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that federal judges may be disqualified from presiding
over cases even when they are unaware during trial of their
personal connection to the cases.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Louisiana, the court said the
appearance of a conflict of interest is grounds for a judge to
disqualify himself from presiding.
   _ Made it easier for creditors to garnish employee benefits from
workers covered by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA).
   By a 5-4 vote in a case from Georgia, the court said ERISA
benefits are not shielded from garnishment even when a state law
seeks to protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors.
   _ Resolved what it called ``a peculiar battle'' between two
federal appeals courts, telling one of those courts to tackle an
antitrust dispute over the M-16, the U.S. military standard rifle.
   The justices unanimously ruled that the Chicago-based 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals should rule in the case, not the
Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
   A common feature of any city's landscape, newsracks often have
been a source of friction between local government and the press.
   USA Today, which depends heavily on its distinctive
blue-and-white coin boxes for national distribution, has been
involved in several cases.
   The parent Gannett Co. Inc. won a federal lawsuit against New
York's Metoropolitan Transportation Authority, which wanted to
charge $75 per newsrack or $150 per station, whichever is higher,
for the privilege of placing USA Today newsracks.
   A judge ruled that fees could only cover administrative costs
but that ruling was reversed.
   Gannett also joined with publishers in Minnesota to win a state
court ruling that struck down a newsrack-licensing ordinance in
Minneapolis. A judge ruled that the ordinance represented an
unconstitutional prior restraint on publication.
   Several newspapers are challenging a Newport, R.I., ordinance
banning newsracks from all public property.
   The case is Lakewood vs. Plain Dealer, 86-1042.

   The stock market receded slightly today and
trading slowed from a brisk early pace that was attributed in part
to the year's second ``triple-witching hour,'' the expiration of
futures and options.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 37 points
on Thursday, was off 4.09 points at 2,090.15 at mid-afternoon.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 283.15 million shares. Losers
led by about 10 to 9 with 647 up, 695 down and 548 unchanged as of
2 p.m on Wall Street.
   Volume exceeded the previous first-hour record just 45 minutes
after the opening bell but had slowed considerably at midday.
Trading in Occidental Petroleum accounted for almost half of the
early volume, with more than 103 million shares changing hands.
Much of the activity was related to the company's impending
quarterly dividend.
   In addition, traders said volume was typically heavy as the
quarterly triple-witching hour got underway. Some stock-index
contracts expired at the opening, while others will expire at the
close of trading.
   ``There's some nervousness,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``But the last few expirations
have been orderly, with no major problems.''
   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, called the activity typical and
noted that the triple-witching hour rendered the market's movements
``meaningless. It is totally controled by non-market, non-economic
factors.''
   On Thursday, severely depressed bond prices helped trigger a
decline in stock prices.
   Rumors that West Germany and possibly Japan might be preparing
to hike interest rates sparked fears that the Federal Reserve might
be pressed to do the same to support the dollar.
   But Goldman said that despite the activity in the credit
markets, the stock market was overdue for a selloff.
   The Dow ``had been up 200 points in just two and a half weeks,''
he noted. ``The market was overbought, and we needed a crack to
clear out some of the optimism.''
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was up | at 50[. The oil

   The dollar closed at varying levels in Europe on
Friday after trading in a narrow range all day. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there was little activity as their
markets were waiting to see whether significant results would
emerge from the Toronto summit of the industrially developed
countries, which starts Sunday.
   Banks and financial markets were shut for a holiday in West
Germany, which also kept conditions quiet.
   The British pound fell in London on reports that the British
trade deficit in the first quarter of this year appeared to be $5
billion and not $3.4 billion as estimated earlier.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7827 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.7900.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late
Thursday: 1.7530 West German marks, up from 1.7505; 1.4575 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4580; 5.9120 French francs, up from 5.9005;
1.9695 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9650; 1,301.35 Italian lire, up
from 1,299.50; 1.2130 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2160.
   In Tokyo earlier, the dollar closed at 125.73 Japanese yen, down
from 125.98. Late in London the dollar traded at 125.85 yen.
   Gold bullion closed in London, the major European market, at a
bid $450 a troy ounce, down from $452.80 Thursday.
   The Zurich price was $450.40 bid, down from $452.50.
   Gold had closed earlier in Hong Kong at a bid $452.15, down from
$454.52.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $7.08 a troy
ounce, down from $7.21.

   Share prices fell Friday on the London Stock
Exchange as the market was hit by worries about interest-rate
increases.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
11.8 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,850.1.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
0.89 point at 2,095.13 as the London trading session drew to a
close, after opening 3.38 points higher.
   Of the FT-SE 100 shares, 16 were higher, while 73 were in
negative territory and 11 showed no change at the end of the
session.
   London analysts said the market was upset by the perception that
the British government would increase interest rates to douse an
overheating economy.
   ``We know the authorities would love to tickle up interest rates
a fraction if they only have the opportunity,'' said one trading
floor manager at a large British brokerage.
   British economic indicators released at midday Friday did
nothing to allay the interest-rate worries, dealers said.
Industrial production rose 1.5 percent in April from March and was
up 4.3 percent from a year earlier, while retail prices rose 0.4
percent in May from April and were 4.2 percent higher than in May
1987.
   The rise in London share prices over the week was another source
of concern, analysts said, as they questioned the speed of the
ascent.
   ``We ran up too far and too fast this week and it just wasn't
sustainable,'' one dealer said.
   In addition, the upcoming three-day Toronto economic summit kept
players guessing about the intentions of the leaders of the Group
of Seven major economic nations.
   ``The G-7 may agree on some policy to push up interest rates to
wring some of the excess liquidity out of the system,'' one dealer
said, ``especially with worries about the potential for disaster
with the worsening drought in the U.S.''

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission said Friday it was studying allegations of dumping of
steel coil from Argentina and Canada following a complaint by
Eurofer, which represents the EEC's main steel companies.
   The Commission had notified Eurofer that previous anti-dumping
duties imposed in 1983 on exporters from the two countries were
close to expiring. But Eurofer alleged the EEC steel industry would
be injured if the duties were dropped.
   According to Eurofer, Canadian exporters were still selling the
products at up to 40 percent below EEC prices.
   In the case of Argentina, Eurofer said that it was worried about
a diversion of steel exports to the EEC from the U.S. market
because of the decline in value of the dollar.
   Eurofer said worldwide Argentinian exports of steel products
rose to 1.176 million metric tons in 1986 from 752,000 tons in 1982.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Welcome Free-Trade Treaty Talks With Japan, Baker Says</HEAD>

comments''; Also moved on general newswires</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States would be happy to consider
negotiating a free-trade agreement with Japan along the lines of
the treaty reached with Canada, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker
III said Friday.
   While there are no current discussion about such a treaty, it
would fit into this country's overall strategy to break down trade
barriers wherever they exist, he said.
   ``We have a major trading relationship with Japan,'' Baker said.
``It (a free trade agreement) would be something that the United
States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the
government of Japan wanted to consider.''
   Baker's comments came in a television interview with foreign
journalists for broadcast outside the United States by the U.S.
Information Agency. The session was a preview of the seven-nation
economic summit opening Sunday in Toronto.
   President Reagan, addressing the annual conference of the USIA
International Council, meantime, reiterated his belief in free
trade while saying trade barriers of other countries are generating
protectionist pressures in America.
   ``It damages the entire world economy when foreign countries
fail to offer the same opportunity to American exports that America
offers to their products,'' Reagan said. ``It is this basic sense
of fairness that has helped generate protectionist pressures in
America. Let me repeat protectionism, the closing of America's
markets, is the wrong response; opening markets, that, I firmly
believe, is the answer.''
   Meanwhile, there appeared to be movement on another contentious
trade dispute between Japan and the United States.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Friday that
he was leaving immediately for Japan, saying a deal may be near on
ending that nation's restrictions on beef imports.
   ``We certainly have not yet reached an agreement, but I'm
persuaded that the news is sufficiently encouraging to justify a
trip,'' Yeutter said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We remain
hopeful,'' but added, ``Until there's a deal, there's no deal.''
   The Agriculture Department has placed the overall value of the
Japanese beef market at $2 billion.
   A U.S.-Japan free-trade agreement would presumably be of
substantial benefit to this country because U.S. officials for
years have pressured the Japanese to open their markets to American
products as a way of reducing the huge trade imbalance between the
two nations.
   The Japanese ran up a trade surplus with the United States last
year of $59.8 billion, more than one-third of this country's
America's overall trade deficit of $170.3 billion.
   The U.S.-Canada pact now being considered by Congress and the
Canadian Parliament would end all trade barriers within 10 years.
   Some critics have charged that specific trade pacts such as the
U.S.-Canada agreement or the plan to eliminate all barriers between
the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1992 pose risks of
returning the world to the trade cartels of the 1930s, which worked
to shrink trade rather than expanding it.
   But Baker disputed this, saying the United States saw any trade
liberalization agreements as beneficial. He said America preferred
to pursue reduction of trade barriers through the discussions being
held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   But he hinted that if those talks did not reach a successful
conclusion, the United States would look to trade pacts with
smaller groups of countries.
   Baker said the summit between President Reagan and other Western
leaders would include a full-fledged discussion of Reagan's
proposal to eliminate all farm subsidies by the year 2000. These
subsidies are costing the major industrial countries $150 billion
annually in higher government support payments and increased food
costs to consumers.
   He acknowledged that the U.S. proposal to eliminate subsidies
was facing intense opposition, with Washington hoping basically for
a reiteration in Toronto of a pledge the industrialized nations
made last month in Paris to press forward in negotiations on the
issue.
   The U.S. delegation, led by Baker, had pressed for more specific
language to adopt Reagan's call for a subsidy-free world in
agricultural trade by a specific date.
   But Baker contended Friday that progress had been made in Paris.
   ``The fact that we are even discussing this very difficult
problem of agricultural subsidies represents progress,'' he said.
``It is not going to be at all easy to move toward eliminating
subsidies or reducing subsidies for any of us unless we are all
able to go to our farmers and say the world is going to do this.''
   European nations have argued that it is politically impossible
to eliminate all farm subsidies and a proper compromise would be to
reduce them, perhaps by cutting them in half.
   The United States is hoping to keep the pressure on so that hard
bargaining to end protectionism in agriculture can take place at a
Montreal trade meeting in December.
   The Montreal meeting will be a midterm review for the current
round of global trade talks which were launched in 1986 in Uruguay
and scheduled to end in 1990.

   The ``Superfund'' toxic waste dump cleanup
program is ineffective, inefficient and still choosing penny-wise,
pound-foolish cleanup methods that may have to be redone later at
great expense, a congressional study said Friday.
   ``Technical evidence confirms that all too frequently, Superfund
is not working environmentally the way the law directs it to,''
said the report issued by the Office of Technology Assessment.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is not consistently
fulfilling the mandate of 1986 amendments that it should prefer
waste treatment technologies that permanently reduce the
``toxicity, mobililty or volume'' of the waste in question, the
report said.
   OTA investigators examined decision documents for about 100
sites affected by the 1986 amendments and selected for detailed
study 10 they believed to be representative.
   Study of such documents, what EPA calls the ``Record of
Decision'' for the site, is particularly useful because ``even
after eight years, cleanup technology is a new and fast-changing
field and the work force is relatively young and inexperienced.
Recent college graduates are often put in charge of multi-million
dollar projects ... they have almost no one to learn from, as
turnover is high. Research papers and technical manuals ... are
quickly outdated.''
   ``Too much flexibility and lack of central management control
are working against an effective, efficient Superfund program,''
the report said.
   Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator in charge of
Superfund, criticized the study for ``a superficial look.''
   ``They continually pressure us to be consistent but I keep
telling them the communities aren't consistent, the states aren't
consistent and the problems aren't consistent,'' Porter said. The
law requires EPA to consider preferences of affected communities
and the states.
   Of the 104 decisions that fall under the 1986 amendments,
treatment technologies were possible in 87 instances and were
chosen in 67, Porter said.
   Porter said the report contained some valid technical points,
``but I disagree with the extrapolations they make.''
   The report called the decisions at the 10 sites questionable
because:
   _If different and readily available technical information had
been used, the decision would have changed significantly.
   _The range of cleanup alternatives was too narrow.
   _The analysis was not comprehensive and was not fair to
different technologies.
   _The study work was not internally consistent.
   _Mistakes were made in calculations and estimates.
   _Critical assumptions were false.
   _Conclusions were stated without analysis and documentation.
   In five instances, treatments were selected before results came
in from small-scale ``treatability'' studies of whether the method
would work at the particular site.
   Eight of the 10 sets of documents were signed on Sept. 29 or
Sept. 30 last year, the last day of the fiscal year, and two on the
last day of the following quarter, which the OTA analysts said
could be an indication that decisions were rushed for the sake of
boosting the number of sites moved along the decision pipeline.
   The agency is selecting impermanent remedies ``purely because
they are cheaper in the short run,'' the report said. Decisions for
on-site containment or landfill disposal of contaminants ``seldom
analyze the risk of future failure, damages and further cleanup.''
   ``Community concerns about impermanence are not very likely to
lead to a more expensive cleanup technology,'' the report said,
noting that EPA appears to be more responsive to companies paying
for cleanups, to states contributing to them, and to its own need
to spread its funds around as far as possible.
   Some examples from the report:
   _In Tulsa County, Okla., EPA chose to cap an abandoned landfill
even though caps have been described as only a ``temporary
solution'' at other cleanups by the same regional office. This does
not meet the statute and there was no examination of any
alternative other than incineration of all the wastes involved nor
of ``the long-term uncertaintites, potential environmental risks
and future cleanup costs.''
   _At Reading, Ohio, EPA chose to glassify the contaminated soil
in place by a novel technique rejected elsewhere in the region and
appears to have overestimated incineration costs by a factor of two.
   _At Elizabeth, N.J., another unproven in-place solidification
technology was selected over incineration, whose costs were
overestimated.

   Stock prices inched higher today amid record
volume attributed to moves to capture dividends and the quarterly
``triple-witching hour,'' the simultaneous expiration of futures
and options contracts.
   There was a crush of activity as the opening bell sounded, with
volume exceeding the previous first-hour record in just 45 minutes.
   Trading in Occidental Petroleum accounted for almost a third of
the day's volume, with most of the activity related to the
company's impending quarterly dividend.
   In addition, traders said volume was typically heavy as the
quarterly triple-witching hour got underway. Some stock-index
contracts expired at the opening, while others expired at the close
of trading.
   Analysts found nothing unusual in the heavy volume, considering
the double-pronged effect of the triple-witching hour and the
dividend plays. They noted, however, that such activity distorted
the real motivation in the market.
   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the triple-witching hour
rendered the market's movements ``meaningless'' and nearly
impossible to analyze. ``It is totally controled by non-market,
non-economic factors,'' he said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials opened slightly higher
but was off more than 16 points before moving back into plus
territory shortly before the close.

<HEAD>Placement of Newsracks Is Protected by First Amendment, Court Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court made it more difficult
Friday for communities to regulate the placement of newspaper boxes
on public sidewalks.
   By a 4-3 vote, the court said placement of the boxes, called
newsracks, is a form of expression in a public forum protected by
the Constitution's First Amendment.
   The decision struck down as unconstitutional a Lakewood, Ohio,
ordinance because it gave the suburban city's mayor too much
discretion in deciding which newsracks would be allowed.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Struck down, by an 8-1 vote, an Ohio law that exempted from any
deadlines the filing of lawsuits against out-of-state defendants.
The justices said the law unduly interfered with interstate
commerce.
   _Made it easier, on a 5-4 vote, for creditors to garnish
employee benefits from workers covered by the federal Employee
Retirement Income Security Act. The court said ERISA benefits are
not shielded from garnishment even when a state law seeks to
protect the benefits from being obtained from creditors.
   _Resolved a jurisdictional tug-of-war between two federal
appeals courts involving an antitrust dispute over the M-16, the
U.S. military standard rifle. The justices unanimously ruled the
Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should rule in the
case, not the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit.
   Writing for the court in the newsrack decision, Justice William
J. Brennan said the ordinance could allow a mayor to deny permits
for newsracks based on a newspaper's content.
   Nothing in Friday's decision, however, necessarily prevents a
community from banning all newsracks.
   Such a ban would not be based on content, Brennan noted, and if
challenged could be upheld if found to be a reasonable restriction
on the time, place or manner of constitutionally protected
expression.
   Three justices voted to uphold the Lakewood ordinance, and said
communities should be free to ban newsracks from all public
property.
   But Brennan said the court's majority was not going to discuss
the validity of such a ban.
   About Lakewood's ordinance, Brennan said ``a law or policy
permitting communication in a certain manner for some but no for
others raises the specter of content and viewpoint censorship.''
   The Lakewood controversy began in 1982 when The Plain Dealer, a
Cleveland newspaper, was refused permission to place coin-operated
newsracks in various locations throughout the suburban city.
   The newspaper sued, and a federal trial judge and the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the ordinance. The appeals
court, however, ruled that Lakewood could charge rent for newsracks
placed on public property and could ban newsracks from residential
neighborhoods.
   Plain Dealer Publisher Thomas Vail said Friday, ``the Supreme
Court has recognized that improper restrictions on newsracks are
subject to prompt constitutional challenge. This is an important
application of First Amendment principles to the public interest in
convenient and effective access to the nation's newspapers.''
   Jerry W. Friedheim, president of American Newspaper Publishers
Association, said the ruling ``underlined what numerous lower
courts, legal scholars and newspapers have always believed: The
distribution of news deserves the highest First Amendment
protection. By reminding public officials that they have strictly
limited powers when they regulate newspaper distribution, the court
gives both newspapers and municipal governments a strong impetus to
find the best ways of keeping the public informed.''
   The decision produced a lively exchange between Brennan and
Justice Byron R. White, author of a combative, 27-page dissenting
opinion.
   While Brennan compared regulating newsracks to regulating people
who pass out leaflets, White said the better comparison was the
regulation of newsracks and soft-drink vending machines.
   ``The First Amendment does not create a right of newspaper
publishers to take a portion of city property to erect a structure
to distribute their papers,'' White wrote for himself and Justices
John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   But Brennan's view, joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry
A. Blackmun and Antonin Scalia, prevailed.
   ``The effectiveness of the newsrack as a means of distribution,
especially for low-budget, controversial neighborhood newspapers,
means that the twin threats of self-censorship and undetectable
censorship are, if anything, greater for newsracks than for
pamphleteers,'' Brennan said.
   The justices sent the Lakewood case back to a federal appeals
court, which must determine whether the ordinance can survive
constitutional attack if the mayoral-discretion aspect is dropped.
   Several similar legal fights are pending in lower courts.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy did not participate in the case.

<TEXT>
   The folksy radio commercials for Motel 6 and the
American Express ad series that features photos of some of its most
famous card members took 1988 Clio awards Friday as the best
national radio and print campaigns.
   The television Clios are to be announced Monday night.
   Richards Group, a Dallas advertising agency, won the national
radio campaign Clio for its ads for Motel 6, which operates a chain
of budget-priced motels.
   The ads use low-key humor to describe the advantages of staying
at Motel 6 and conclude with the promise, ``We'll leave the light
on for you.''
   Among other advertising agencies and production houses that won
radio Clios, the big winner was Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch of Los
Angeles.
   Orkin won three Clios with ads for Kroger Co. in the local large
campaign category, for Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Ohio in health
care services and Sheffield Hotel in the travel segment.
   The ad agencies Campbell-Mithun of Chicago, W.B. Doner & Co. of
Baltimore, Hal Riney & Partners of San Francisco and Chiat-Day
Advertising of Los Angeles each won two radio Clios.
   A total of 28 Clios were awarded in the U.S. radio competition.
   Ogilvy & Mather of New York won the national print campaign Clio
for its American Express ad series called ``Portraits.'' The
campaign has featured striking photographs of some of its
best-known card members, including former House Speaker Thomas P.
O'Neill, ex-baseball pitcher Tom Seaver, actress Candice Bergen and
singer Ella Fitzgerald.
   The agency winning the most Clios for print advertising was
Fallon McElligott of Minneapolis with 11. Its winning work included
ads for the University of Minnesota athletic department, First
Tennesee Bank and the Children's Defense Fund.
   The agencies Martin-Williams of Minneapolis and Chiat-Day, which
has offices in New York and San Francisco as well as Los Angeles,
each won three print Clios. There were 37 Clios awarded in the U.S.
print competition.
   In U.S. packaging design, Gerstman-Myers Inc., a New York design
firm, was the only multiple winner with two Clios. Buntin
Advertising of Nashville was the only multiple winner in U.S.
specialty design competition with two Clios.
   The awards program is administered by Clio Awards, a private
company based in New York that has overseen the competition for 29
years.

<HEAD>Foreign Debt Topped Agenda During Treasury Secretary's Washington
Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli
offered ``alternative'' proposals to reduce Mexico's foreign debt
burden when he met this week with leaders of U.S. and multinational
financial institutions in Washington, the Treasury Department said
Thursday night.
   Petricioli also urged U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
to place the foreign debt crisis high on the agenda when leaders of
the Group of Seven industrialized countries meet next week in
Toronto.
   Mexico's inflation-fighting plan and a possible new bond issue
to foreign creditors willing to retire Mexican debt paper also were
discussed during the Washington meetings, the Treasury said in a
statement.
   Petricioli signed a $265 million World Bank loan for Mexico's
fertilizer industry during his trip and also met with Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, World Bank President Barber
Conable and International Monetary Fund Director Michel Camdessus.
   Mexican Treasury Department officials who accompanied Petricioli
held informal discussions with authorities from Canada, France,
Spain, Japan, Britain and West Germany.
   Participants in those meetings discussed the ``search for more
efficient formulas for the treatment of the problem of the debt and
how to reach an adequate equilibrium between servicing the external
obligations of Mexico and the undeferable necessity of recuperating
economic growth,'' the statement said.
   Mexico's $105 billion foreign debt is the developing world's
second largest, after Brazil.
   The meetings ``studied not only a proposal, but also a range of
possibilities in which banks, financial authorities, international
organizations and Mexico will continue working to reduce the weight
of our debt,'' the statement said.
   It added that the representatives of those nations agreed ``to
explore various alternative solutions'' to easing Mexico's interest
and principal payment schedules. The officials will meet again
after the Group of Seven summit and ``after those authorities
visited have been able to study the Mexican proposals,'' the
statement said.
   Mexico paid between $8 billion and $9 billion in interest
payments alone on the foreign debt last year.
   Petricioli briefed Baker and Greenspan on the government's plans
to offer a new debt-for-bonds swap program before Mexican President
Miguel de la Madrid leaves office in December.
   Mexico reduced its debt by $1.1 billion by issuing low-interest
bonds in exchange for debt paper held by creditor banks under the
first such swap program in February. That program fell short of
expectations, with Mexico rejecting nearly half of the bank bids
for the bonds as too low.
   Petricioli and Baker explored ``ways in which the mechanism
could result in a greater impact and produce clearer and more
favorable effects on the external debt,'' the Treasury said.
   Camdessus and Petricioli held a ``joint evaluation'' of an
18-month IMF economic restructuring program that expired in
December ``with satisfactory results,'' the statement said.
   Petricioli briefed Conable on the progress of the
government-sponsored Economic Solidary Pact with Mexico's labor and
business sectors to bring inflation to between 1 percent and 2
percent monthly by the end of the year.
   Implemented in December, the plan froze prices for
government-regulated goods, wages and the peso exchange rate.
Consumer prices rose only 1.9 percent in May after registering a
record 15.5 percent hike in January.
   Conable and Petricioli also discussed possible future World Bank
lending to Mexico to assist the restructuring of the economy, the
Treasury statement noted.

   Pennwalt Corp. said Friday it is exploring
the sale of its pharmaceuticals and equipment divisions and refused
comment on an investment partnership's takeover offer.
   Centaur Partners, which holds 6.5 percent of Pennwalt's common
stock, sent a letter to Pennwalt Chairman Edwin Tuttle on Friday
offering to buy the company ``on a friendly basis at a significant
premium to the market price.''
   Centaur demanded a response by Tuesday and told Tuttle, ``If you
refuse to meet with us or to respond to this letter, we must
reserve the right to pursue all options available to us.'' That
would include a hostile tender offer.
   Pennwalt's stock rose $2.87{ a share to $81 a share Friday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock had jumped
$9.25 a share in the preceding two sessions.
   Since there are slightly more than 12 million shares
outstanding, Friday's closing price gives Pennwalt a market value
of nearly $1 billion.
   Centaur is composed of Melvyn J. Estrin of Washington, D.C., a
financier and real estate investor and former chairman of American
Health Services; Abbey J. Butler, president of C.B. Equities with
assets in access of $500 million, and former chairman of Financial
World magazine; and Robert Nederlander, a lawyer and president of
Nederlander Organization Corp., which owns Broadway theaters, and
also part owner of the New York Yankees of the American League.
   Combined they reportedly have assets in excess of $300 million,
which includes the $52.9 million they currently hold in Pennwalt
stock. The group also is reported to have a financing commitment
from Citicorp, the nation's largest banking conglomerate, should
they have to make a tender offer.
   Tuttle said Pennwalt's investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
have been directed to continue discussions with possible buyers of
the pharmaceutical division and to explore the possible sale of the
equipment group.
   Pennwalt's pharmaceuticals division accounted for about 11
percent of sales and 14 percent of operating earnings last year,
while the equipment division accounted for 14 percent of sales and
11 percent of operating earnings.
   Pennwalt spokeswoman Ann Carmandy declined to comment on whether
there were any offers for any of the Pennwalt divisions offered for
sale.
   The company's biggest unit, chemicals and natural resources, is
not up for sale. Last year the entire company earned $52.4 million
on revenue of $1.14 billion.
   Pennwalt has 9,600 employees worldwide and current management
owns only 1.3 percent of the stock.

dive, blamed rising interest rates and high home prices,
particularly in the Northeast section of the country where
construction starts fell 22.3 percent.
   Housing activity is closely watched because it often is a
harbinger of the direction of the economy as a whole. However,
analysts cautioned against overreacting to one month's report and
said they expected at least a modest rebound this summer.
   The report had little effect on the stock market, where the Dow
Jones industrial average of 30 stocks rose 9.78 points to 2,104.02.
Trading of nearly 344 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, heaviest of the year, was attributed to dividend plays
and technical factors associated with ``triple witching hour''
expiration of futures and options contracts.
   Inflation fears continued to plague the credit markets, where
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged above 9 percent.
   The Commerce Department said the May decline dragged overall
housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.38 million units, compared with a rate of 1.58 million units in
April.
   Single-family construction dropped 9.2 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 988,000 after dipping 7.2 percent in April.
   Multifamily building starts, a volatile category, dropped 18.9
percent to a rate of 396,000 units in May, bouncing off a 36.7
percent increase a month earlier.
   Apartment building has been in the doldrums for more than a year
because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax law that made
investment in rental housing less profitable.
   It was the most precipitous drop in total housing construction
since December's 15.8 percent fall and the lowest level in activity
since January.
   Construction of single-family units have not been lower since
August 1984, when units were begun at a 967,000 annual rate.
   ``Mortgage interest rates were rising pretty quickly during the
month of May and that rise may have scared a lot of builders into
pulling back,'' said Richard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of
the Mortgage Bankers of America.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., rates on
30-year, fixed rate mortgages climbed from an average of 10.05
percent early in April to 10.58 percent late in May. The averages
do not include add-on fees known as points.
   Rates have eased so far this month, averaging 10.35 percent this
week. However, most economists are predicting rising rates through
the end of the year.
   ``If you're seriously considering buying a home in the near
term, sooner is going to be better rather than later,'' said John
Savacool, an economist with the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm. ``There's a window of opportunity here where
rates are down a little bit. ... It's probably going to be more
favorable than you can expect over the next 12 months.''
   An increase of a half percentage point, from 10.0 percent to
10.5 percent, boosts a homebuyer's monthly principal and interest
payment on a 30-year, $100,000 mortgage from $878 to $915.
   Some analysts pointed to May figures on housing permits,
considered a good indication of future construction activity, as a
sign of hope. Single-family permits edged up 0.8 percent in May,
although overall permits declined 1.5 percent.
   However, David Seiders, chief economist of the National
Association of Home Builders, said a survey of home builders early
this month showed their confidence slipped significantly from early
May. The proportion of builders saying sales prospects were good to
excellent fell from 41 percent to 34 percent, he said.
   The May drop in housing starts was led by identical 22.3 percent
declines in the Northeast, where construction of housing was begun
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 206,000, and the Midwest,
where homes were started at a 269,000 yearly rate.
   However, Midwestern starts were seesawing off a 32.1 percent
increase a month earlier, while the decline in the Northeast came
on top of an 8.6 percent drop in April and a 5.9 percent fall in
March.
   It was the lowest level of construction activity in the
Northeast since September 1984, when the rate was 203,000 units,
and the steepest drop since the 24 percent plunge of November 1985.
   Starts in the South dropped 6.4 pecent to 555,000 and starts in
the West fell 4.8 percent to 354,000.
   Michael Sumichrast, a real estate economist in Washington, said
soaring prices of new homes in the Northeast and in California are
responsible for declines in those areas. Other factors are the
scarcity of suitable land and tight regional labor markets.
   ``The enormous increase in prices has made it virtually
impossible for first-time home buyers to buy homes,'' he said. ``I
have been telling builders they are pricing themselves out of the
market.''
   He said builders have been concentrating too heavily on the
move-up home buyer and should build more modest homes on smaller
pieces of land in order to attract less wealthy buyers.

   The stock market finished mixed Friday amid the
heaviest volume of 1988, which brokers attributed to
dividend-capture strategies and the ``triple-witching hour''
expirations of futures and options contracts.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.78 points to
close at 2,104.02. A late wave of blue-chip buying pushed the key
index up just before the close, but the broader market remained
depressed.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
642 issues up, 850 down and 450 unchanged.
   Trading was the heaviest this year and the fifth busiest ever.
Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 343.92 million shares, up from
161.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 367.25
million shares.
   Volume exceeded the previous first-hour record just 45 minutes
after the opening bell, then slowed. Trading in Occidental
Petroleum accounted for nearly a third of the day's volume, with
more than 104 million shares changing hands. Much of the activity
was related to the company's impending quarterly dividend.
   In addition, traders said the quarterly triple-witching hour
contributed to the crush of stocks traded. Some stock-index
contracts expired at the opening, while others expired at the end
of the session.
   Analysts said the heavy volume obscured the more basic
motivations behind trading.
   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, noted that the triple-witching
hour helped to render the market's movements ``meaningless. It is
totally controlled by non-market, non-economic factors.''
   Still, traders said institutional investors showed some healthy
interest in buying equities. The Dow average had been down much of
the day, but bargain hunters stepped in along with some
computer-generated buying at the end of the day.
   ``There was some good activity in the blue chips, and the Dow,
which had been off almost 17 points, swung back in the last 20
minutes,'' one trader said.
   Many strategists remain optimistic that the Dow index, which had
climbed about 200 points in recent weeks, will continue to head
higher into July, as money managers with huge pools of cash are
pressed to invest before the end of the quarter.
   But Goldman said he's ``getting nervous. Crowds are very
dangerous to your health in the stock market.''
   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down 1{ at 48. The oil
giant held its annual meeting, where financier Carl Icahn addressed
shareholders in his quest to win their votes in a proxy battle with
Texaco management.
   Separately, Occidental Petroleum was up [ at 26~, IBM rose ] to
117{, General Motors rose 1[ to 80[, Woolworth fell 1[ to 52[, and
Burlington Northern rose 1| to 69.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased in value by $6.86
billion, or 0.26 percent, from Thursday.
   The NYSE index was up 0.40 at 152.84.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 0.84 to 312.80,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was 270.68, up 0.91.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.37
to 305.70. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 386.92, off 0.18.

<HEAD>Saatchi Agrees To Buy Gartner Group for $90.3 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi & Saatchi Co. PLC, the British
communications giant, said Friday it agreed to acquire Gartner
Group Inc., a Connecticut-based information technology consultant,
for $90.3 million.
   Saatchi said Gartner's board had approved the deal, which had
been a topic of speculation all week. Gartner had announced Monday
that it was talking to a potential buyer and speculation soon
focused on Saatchi.
   Saatchi has been developing its line of consulting services
since growing into the world's biggest ad holding company through
acquisitions.
   Saatchi said a wholly owned subsidiary plans to begin a tender
offer of $22.50 a share for all of Gartner's 4.1 million shares of
common stock. The offer is conditioned on a majority of the shares
of Gartner being tendered to Saatchi.
   The companies said in a statement that holders of about 30
percent of Gartner common stock, including Chairman Gideon Gartner,
had agreed to tender their shares to Saatchi.
   Saatchi said Gartner and two executive vice presidents also
agreed to eneter into long-term employment deals.
   Gartner Group, which had closed at $13.50 a share last week,
rose $4.25 a share on Friday to $22 in over-the-counter trading.
   Gartner specializes in analyzing and making forecasts of the
information technology market. It provides information services to
vendors and users of technolgy-related products and services.
   Saatchi said Gartner had a pre-tax profit of $3.8 million on
revenue of $40 million in the year ended March 31.

<HEAD>Soybeans Hit 11-Year High; Corn Again Soars Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices soared to 11-year highs Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade and corn futures advanced the daily limit
for the fourth consecutive session in anticipation of more dry
weather and deeper crop losses.
   On other exchanges, livestock and meat futures were mixed; sugar
rose the limit; precious metals rose; energy futures declined; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 agricultural and
industrial commodities jumped 2.52 points to a four-year high of
263.30.
   Forecasts for a hot, mostly dry weekend in the Midwest
underpinned the grain-and-soybean rally and furthered speculation
of irreparable damage to drought-stressed crops, analysts said.
   ``The market is obviously convinced that the dry weather pattern
is in place and going to continue,'' said Rich Feltes, director of
commodity research with Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based trading
firm.
   Corn crops, which are now entering a critical pollination stage,
are particularly threatened by the drought, Feltes said. On that
basis, the price for near-month delivery of corn closed above $3 a
bushel for the first time since September 1984.
   Corn for July and September delivery advanced the
15-cents-a-bushel limit; July and August soybeans soared their
30-cents-a-bushel limit.
   Wheat settled { cent to 6 cents higher with July at $3.81{ a
bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 15 cents higher with July at
$3.09{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 9} cents higher with July at
$2.98 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 30 cents higher with July
at $9.71{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly seven-state
cattle-on-feed report.
   The report showed a record number of cattle placed on feedlots
last month to be fattened for slaughter, outpacing most pre-report
estimates and resulting in predictions of lower cattle futures
prices next week.
   Much of the increased placements were probably due to producers
selling cattle to feedlots because of dry pastures, analysts said.
   ``The pasture levels are at their worst since the 1930s, since
the Dustbowl period,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Most analysts expect cattle and hog producers to liquidate large
portions of their herds, driving prices sharply lower, if the
drought continues.
   Live cattle settled .55 cent lower to .28 cent higher with June
at 70.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .58 cent lower to .10
cent higher with August at 71.80 cents a pound; hogs were .90 cent
lower to 1 cent higher with June at 49.80 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with July at
43.10 cents a pound.
   World sugar futures surged their 0.5 cent-a-pound limit on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on unconfirmed reports that
Cuba had declared ``force majeure'' on most of its sugar shipments
through July. Such a declaration means a producer or exporter will
be unable to fulfill its contractual shipment obligations due to
unavoidable circumstances.
   The July sugar contract, on which the daily price limit has been
removed pending its upcoming expiration, settled .65 cent higher at
10.34 cents a pound.
   Lumber futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
reaction to the government's report of an unexpected 12.2 percent
decline in housing starts last month, analysts said.
   Lumber for July delivery settled down the $5 limit at $194.50
per 1,000 board feet.
   Precious metals advanced on the Commodity Exchange in New York
in response to the higher grain prices and a decline in the bond
markets, analysts said.
   Gold settled $4.50 to $5.20 higher with August at $458.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 11.4 cents to 13.6 cents higher with July at
$7.255 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices declined on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in a reversal of Thursday's sharp gains, which were
prompted by unconfirmed rumors that Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini had died.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 21 cents
lower with July at $16.45 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .48
cent lower with July at 43.64 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.22 cent to .55 cent lower with July at 49.97 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .65 point higher at 272.75.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed Friday in slow
foreign-exchange trading, which brokers attributed largely to their
reluctance to speculate in currencies before the Toronto economic
summit.
   Gold prices rose in the United States on inflation fears after
falling abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at
$454.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $450 late Thursday.
   Foreign-exchange brokers said the dollar was supported by signs
of economic strength in the United States, notably the report of a
shrunken monthly trade deficit earlier in the week.
   At the same time, the dollar was hurt by moves toward higher
interest rates in West Germany and Japan. This made investments
denominated in Japanese yen and West German marks relatively more
valuable.
   The slack trading volume was largely blamed on the slight chance
that leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies meeting
this Sunday in Toronto would make statements or take action that
would affect currency values. As a result, most traders weren't
willing to make speculative moves.
   ``It's just a precautionary measure,'' said Robert Hatcher, vice
president of corporate trading at Barclays Bank PLC's New York
branch. ``One never can be certain what might emerge from the
meeting. Rather than stick your neck out, you assume a defensive
positon. You wait for their communique.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.73 yen, down from 125.98 yen
late Thursday. Later in London the dollar traded at 125.85 yen. By
the time trading concluded in New York, the dollar was quoted at
125.74 yen, up from 125.52 yen.
   The pound fell in London on reports that the British trade
deficit in the first quarter of this year was higher than
originally estimated. Later in New York, the pound traded at
$1.7837, cheaper than $1.7912 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with levels late
Thursday, included: 1.7486 West German marks, down from 1.7489;
1.4557 Swiss francs, down from 1.4566; 1.2137 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2131; 5.9010 French francs, up from 5.8982; and 1,298.50
Italian lire, down from 1,298.75.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.7530 West German marks, up from 1.7505;
1.4575 Swiss francs, down from 1.4580; 5.9120 French francs, up
from 5.9005; 1.9695 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9650; 1,301.35
Italian lire, up from 1,299.50; 1.2130 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2160.
   Rising gold prices in the United States reflected fears of
drought-spawned domestic inflation, which has been pushing grain
and meat prices sharply higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, bullion for current delivery rose $4.50 a troy ounce to
$454.50.
   Earlier in London, gold fell to $450 a troy ounce, down from
$452.80 late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fetched
$450.40, down from $452.50 Thursday, and in Hong Kong gold fetched
$452.15 compared with $454.52 Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $7.08 a troy ounce, down
from $7.21. On the New York Comex, bullion for current delivery was
quoted at $7.235 an ounce, up 12 cents.

<TEXT>
   A late rally pushed the stock market higher
Friday as trading surged to its fastest pace of the year.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 343.92 million
shares, with much of the action attributed to dividend-related
purchases and to trading associated with the ``triple-witching
hour,'' which marks the quarterly expiration of stock futures and
options contracts.
   The volume surpassed the 310.03 million shares that changed
hands June 8.
   Prices were down most of the day, but stocks rallied late in the
session.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, down almost 17 points a
half-hour before the close, ended the session up 9.78 at 2,104.02.
Four stocks rose in price for every three that fell on the NYSE.
   Trading in Occidental Petroleum accounted for almost a third of
the day's volume, with more than 104 million shares traded. Friday
was the last day for shareholders to be eligible for the company's
impending quarterly dividend.
   In addition, the heavy volume was typical for a triple-witching
hour session, traders noted. Some stock-index contracts expired at
the opening, while others expired at the close of trading.

<HEAD>Guilford Announces D & H Railway Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILLERICA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Delaware & Hudson Railway Co. will
seek protection under of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws on
Monday, the railway's parent company announced Friday.
   Guilford Transportation Industries said a federal arbitrator's
ruling earlier this week and ``other financial conditions'' forced
the move.
   Under a decision Wednesday by arbitrator Richard Kasher,
Delaware & Hudson could not be leased to the Springfield Terminal
Railway Co. to generate income, Guilford said in a statement.
   The decision left the railroad with only enough cash reserves to
operate for another 48 hours to 72 hours, Guilford said in a
statement.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Railroad
Administration and the states of New York and Pennsylvania were
notified Friday of the company's decision to seek Chapter 11
protection on June 20, according to the statement.
   The arbitrator's decision forced Guilford to reverse a massive
reorganization of its railroad lines that began last year, rehire
employees, award back pay and reinstate old work guidelines.
   It was the third blow to the railroad this week, following a
federal complaint about inadequate service and an arbitrator's
decision ordering Guilford to rehire 1,200 workers after a
seven-month strike and give them $15 million in back pay.
   Kasher said all work rules, pay rates and working conditions
from the old Boston & Maine Corp. and Maine Central Railroad Corp.
must apply to the Springfield Terminal, which Guilford created last
year to replace the two lines.
   The ruling effectively crippled Guilford's reorganization to cut
costs to compete with the trucking industry.
   The Delaware & Hudson was the nation's oldest continually
operated transportation company, formed in 1823 as a canal company.
   Its sale was finalized in January 1984 to Guilford, which bought
the financially ailing railway after a series of government
subsidies by federal and state governments including New York.
   Guilford last year began switching operations of four
subsidiaries _ Boston & Maine, Maine Central, Portland Terminal
Corp. and Delaware & Hudson _ to Springfield Terminal.
   Friday, state Department of Transportation spokesman Timothy
Hulbert said the department had just been informed of Guilford's
plans and did not have an immediate comment.
   Earlier this week however, DOT said it would take steps to block
any interruption of service along the New York freight railroad
network served by Guilford Transportation Industries.
   State DOT officials said they would petition the Interstate
Commerce Commission to force Guilford to keep lines operated by the
D&H open. The state said it would also move to repossess 165
boxcars from the Delaware & Hudson provided by the state under a
lease agreement.

<HEAD>Mulroney Sees Progress on Farm Subsidies, Third World Debt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Mulroney comments. Dollar figures are

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the world's seven biggest industrial
democracies began arriving Friday for their annual economic summit,
with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney forecasting progress on
dismantling farm subsidies and alleviating Third World debt.
   Several downtown streets were fenced off and a police robot was
used to check one parking lot for explosives as a security cordon
enveloped the Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center, where the
heads of state and government will meet for three days, starting
Sunday.
   Mulroney told some of the 1,300 accredited media that the
principal objective of the summit is ``to maintain the ongoing
pattern of increased growth in a non-inflationary climate.''
   Canada's annual inflation rate rose Friday to 4.1 percent from
4.0 percent last month.
   Mulroney said summits will be ``much poorer'' without President
Reagan, attending his eighth and last gathering.
   The Canadian leader looked for ``modest but very important
progress'' in solving the global escalation in farm subsidies,
estimated at $150 to $200 billion a year.
   ``It is very important that all of us, including Japan,
recognize that these subsidies to agriculture are trade-distorting
in nature (and) eventually protectionist,'' he said. ``They cost
treasuries more money than any of us can legitimately afford and
ultimately they're very harmful to the farmers.''
   He noted that Canada and France canceled $580 million worth of
debt from African nations last year and if other summit countries
do likewise, it would wipe away 14 percent to 15 percent of the
debt owed by ``the poorest of the poor.''
   ``Some of these countries are so crippled by this oppressive
debt that they couldn't pay it if they lived forever,'' he said.
``It's uncollectable.''
   The summit site was sealed off by 15-foot-high fences, and a
3,000-member security force was on full alert following the recent
arrests of suspected Japanese Red Army terrorists in the United
States and the Philippines.
   Japanese terrorist groups were linked to rocket and bomb attacks
during the last two summits in Tokyo and Venice.
   ``We're equipped to deal with anything that might happen,'' said
Metropolitan Police Superintendent Bernard Nadeau.
   Security was especially tight at the six downtown hotels hosting
Presidents Reagan and Francois Mitterrand of France; Prime
Ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain, Mulroney, Noboru Takeshita
of Japan and Ciriaco De Mita of Italy; Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
West Germany and European Community Commission President Jacques
Delors.
   Kohl visited the University of Toronto, where he received an
honorary doctor of law degree and announced a five-year program
enabling Canadian scientists to study at the West German research
institute of their choice. He spent Friday evening with a group of
German-Canadians in Kitchener, Ont.
   Takeshita arrived here Friday after a one-day stopover in
Vancouver.
   Mrs. Thatcher, De Mita and Delors arrive Saturday, and Reagan
and Mitterrand go straight to Sunday's official welcoming ceremony.
   The British prime minister is the senior leader, having taken
office in May 1979, but Reagan gets preference in protocol since he
is head of state, as well as head of government. Queen Elizabeth II
is head of state in Britain.
   In a pre-summit interview with the Toronto Star, published
Friday, Reagan said he will ask his partners for help in resettling
5 million Afghan refugees back into their country following the
withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   ``They literally come home with nothing,'' he said.
   Reagan also looks for action on reducing the burden of farm
subsidies, which has drained treasuries while producing wasteful
surpluses. But he said: ``We must do it in a way that does not
suddenly pull the rug out from under farmers in any of our
countries.''
   Each nation is bringing its own agenda, from Italy's concern
about acid rain to a three-pronged British plan for easing Third
World debt.
   The final communique on Tuesday is expected to urge more
structural reforms, such as deregulation, tax reform and
privatization, to promote growth and avert protectionism.
   The 14th economic summit is the first ever held in a major North
American city. The security curtain in Canada's largest metropolis
upset some residents, including student and anti-war protest groups
denied permission to gather anywhere near the meeting site.
   ``Why, when these guys get together, is it that all of the basic
rights we are supposed to be celebrating in the Western world
suddenly disappear?'' opposition legislator Bob Rae complained in
the Ontario legislature.
   Fifty Toronto prostitutes marched to Royal Canadian Mounted
Police headquarters to protest sweeps resulting in 723 charges
against streetwalkers and their clients. Prostitution is legal in
Toronto, but solicitation is not.
   ``It's as if politicians think these foreign visitors are
small-town kids and are going to be offended,'' complained Valerie
Scott of the Canadian Organization for the Rights of Prostitutes.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Grandson from Using Gucci Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The international family feud over use of the
Gucci name for retail sales was partially settled Friday, with a
federal judge ruling the grandson of the company's founder cannot
use his own name as a trademark.
   Gucci is barred from designing and selling merchandise under the
company name ``Paolo Gucci,'' as he has in the past, the judge said.
   But U.S. District Judge William C. Conner, in a 33-page
decision, ruled Paolo Gucci can attach his name to other
trademarked products.
   Paolo's name can follow an existing trademark _ for example,
``American Tourister Luggage by Paolo Gucci,'' the judge wrote. But
his name cannot be more prominent than the trademark, and there
must be a disclaimer that he does not work for Gucci, Conner said.
   ``It is clear ... that if Paolo Gucci were to continue to use
his name as a trademark or a trade name, an appreciable number of
consumers would confuse his goods with those of the defendant,''
Conner wrote in his ruling.
   An attorney for Gucci Shops, Inc., which has 21 stores around
the United States, was in a meeting at his Washington office and
was unavailable for comment on the ruling. The company sought to
block Paolo from using the Gucci name on competing products.
   Paolo, 57, is now designing lamps, sunglasses, furniture,
sleepwear, bedding accessories, wall covering, lingerie, plates and
flatware.
   ``I just got off the phone with Paolo from London, and he's
thrilled, totally ecstatic,'' said his attorney, Randy Lipsitz.
``He considers this a complete victory.''
   Paolo, the grandson of company founder Guccio Gucci, was ousted
from the company following a family dispute in 1978. Despite
attempts to patch things up with his cousin Maurizio _ now owner of
50 percent of the company _ the pair have instead ended up in court
settling their differences.
   The suit settled Friday was filed five years ago; the cousins
are embroiled in another legal fight currently before an
arbitration panel in Geneva, Switzerland.

<HEAD>Two Firms Complain of No-Bid Contract Award To Perot's Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two companies have asked the General Services
Administration to void a contract between a firm owned by Dallas
billionaire Ross Perot and the U.S. Postal Service, which
maintained Friday the deal was proper.
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. of Dallas and Planning Research
Corp. of McLean, Va., filed a complaint with the GSA Board of
Contract Appeals, saying they didn't have a chance to bid on the
$500,000 contract awarded Perot Systems Corp.
   The complaint alleges that the no-bid contract, under which
Perot Systems will review the Postal Service's cost-cutting
procedures, violated federal contract procedures.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, in a prepared statement,
said Friday, ``It is our position that we did not do anything wrong
or improper,'' regarding the contract.
   But Bill Wright, a spokesman for EDS, said, ``Any time these
kind of contracts occur, there's potential busines you can't have.
It takes us out of the market.''
   Planning Research Corp. spokesman Chuck Taylor said the company
would not comment on the complaint while it is in litigation.
   A secretary for Perot said he was out of the country and could
not be reached.
   The complaints were filed under the Brooks Act, which is more
than 20 years old. The act gives the GSA review authority over
federal data-processing contracts. The GSA board, which has 45
working days to issue a ruling, has the power to revise, revoke or
suspend the contract. Its ruling can be appealed to federal court.
   The EDS complaint alleges that the Postal Service failed to open
the contract to review and bidding and included several unusual
provisions in the contract that would favor Perot Systems, the
Dallas Morning News reported.
   Perot announced June 2 that he had formed Perot Systems, a
Washington-based computer services company with several former EDS
mid-level executives.
   Under the contract, Perot Systems is to conduct a study of the
Postal Service's performance regarding transportation, telephone
systems, delivery, revenue protection and transportation equipment
duties.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Tumble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices tumbled Friday on a combination of
inflation and interest-rate worries, pushing long-term interest
rates over 9 percent again and more than erasing a big price rise
earlier in the week.
   Prices of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped 1\
points, or $12.50 for every $1,000 in face value. More than half of
the decline occurred in very light activity in the afternoon
session, analysts said.
   Over the past three trading sessions, the price of the long bond
has fallen about $30, more than offsetting the $21 gain it made
Tuesday on news of a narrower U.S. trade deficit in April.
   As prices fell Friday, the 30-year bond's yield rose to 9.09
percent from 8.98 percent late Thursday. Yields had fallen to 8.81
percent on Tuesday. Last week, the long bond's yield finished at
9.04 percent.
   Analysts said the latest decline in prices reflected a
continuation of the market's reappraisal of the outlook for
interest rates and inflation.
   ``People are looking at the economy more closely,'' said Harold
Nathan, economist for Wells Fargo & Co. ``The economy still remains
robust and strong enough to generate inflation.''
   Nathan said the market's mood is so sour that it shrugged off a
Commerce Department report Friday that housing construction
plummeted 12.2 percent in May, the steepest drop in five months.
   A report indicating economic weakness is usually seen by bond
traders as an encouraging development because it indicates there
may be weaker demand for credit and less inflationary pressure.
Stronger credit demand pushes interest rates higher and bond prices
lower, while inflation erodes bond values.
   Robert Chandross, chief economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York,
said the market is preoccupied with speculation that the West
German central bank may tighten its monetary policy, and that other
central banks may follow its lead in encouraging higher interest
rates.
   He expects rates will ``work higher over the next few months,''
with yields on 30-year Treasury bonds approaching 10 percent by the
end of September.
   Nathan of Wells Fargo said he also feels the trend in interest
rates is upward, and expects the long bond could yield 9.75 percent
by late August.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell \ point, intermediate maturities fell by {
point to } point and 20-year issues lost { point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures prioces of all Treasury issues with maturities of a year
or longer, fell 6.47 to 1,144.02.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, lost 2.26 to 280.67
   In the tax-exempt market, prices fell } point, according to the
Bond Buyer's Municipal Bond Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 8 basis points to 6.37
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 10 basis points to 6.70 percent and one-year
bills rose 10 basis points to 7.02 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 7-16 percent, down from 7{
percent late Thursday.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disposable contact lens, introduced
on a limited basis in this country only last year, will be much
more visible this summer.
   On Friday, Bausch & Lomb, the nation's leading maker of contact
lenses and related solutions, introduced its entry into the
disposable market called SeeQuence.
   The lenses, designed for replacement every one to two weeks,
will cost a customer between $300 and $500 a year and will be test
marketed in six cities in California and Florida.
   They are a further extension of the company's ``Fresh Lens''
frequent replacement program, started in 1985, which calls for
periodic office visits and new lenses every month or several months.
   About 75,000 patients are enrolled in that program in the United
States and overseas.
   ``We see that the entire concept of dispoale contact lenses has
a lot going for it,'' said Franklin Jepson, a spokesman for Bausch
& Lomb. ``We think people are realizing there's other reasons to
replace a contact lens besides having lost one, torn one or not
being able to see out of one.''
   Meanwhile, the company that first brought disposable contact
lenses to the Untied States, Vistakon Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is planning a news
conference on Tuesday to announce that its ACUVUE lenses will be
available nationally in July.
   Vistakon has been ``quite pleased'' with its sales so far in
Florida and California, where it launched the disposable lenses
last year, said Dr. Sheldon Wechsler, a company vice president.
   Disposable soft contact lenses are being touted as healthier for
the eye and easier to use than both daily-wear lenses, which have
to be disinfected each night, and extended-wear lenses, which have
been cited as contributing to some eye ailments because they're
worn for long periods of time.
   The disposable lenses are not significantly different than
lenses currently on the market, said Irving Aarons, an analyst who
follows the eye care industry for Arthur D. Little Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass.
   The difference between conventional and disposable lenses stems
from the cost of making and packaging them, Aarons said. The
wholesale cost of soft contact lenses is about $8 to $12, but
Vistakon sells its disposable lenses for about $2.50 a pair, Aarons
said.
   Bausch & Lomb is ``following on the coattails'' of Vistakon with
its disposable lenses, but wants to make sure it has something on
the market in case disposable contact lenses skyrocket, Aarons said.
   The disposable contact lens concept started in Denmark in the
mid-1980s and has been used there and in Scandanavia since.

<HEAD>Allegheny International Board Approves Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Allegheny
International Inc. approved Friday a bankruptcy reorganization plan
calling for shareholders to retain 25 percent of the restructured
company's common stock.
   The Pittsburgh-based consumer products company also said it
welcomed any proposals or plans of reorganization from qualified
buyers, opening the door to a Los Angeles investor interested in
purchasing the company.
   The plan provides for all creditors of three of the company's
subsidiaries _ Sunbeam Corp., Almet-Lawnlite Inc. and Chemetron
Corp. _ to be paid in full.
   Unsecured creditors of Allegheny International are to receive
varying percentages of their claims, payable in cash, notes and
common stock.
   The plan, which will be filed Monday, is subject to approval by
shareholders and the bankruptcy court.
   Chairman Oliver S. Travers said the plan is ``a strong step
forward in the company's emergence from Chapter 11 protection and
for the continuing focus on AI's consumer products business.''
   Allegheny International filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws on Feb. 20, 1988.
   The filing of the plan has been eagerly awaited by Los Angeles
investor David Murdock, who runs food processor Castle & Cooke.
   Murdock said he wanted to see management's own reorganization
plan before he makes a formal proposal to acquire Allegheny
International.
   A group of dissidents, supported by New York investor Bennett
LeBow, wanted to gain control of the board before management
submitted its reorganization plan to bankruptcy court. LeBow had
said he may propose a plan that would give him control of Allegheny
International while paying shareholders more than their stock is
now worth on the market.
   A proxy vote for seven of 13 board seats is scheduled for Monday.
   A federal appeals court has ordered the company to take no
action on its reorganization plan until at least late July, when
the court will consider a suit filed by creditors aimed at halting
the proxy battle.

<DATELINE>FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Best Corp. said it has signed a
$316 million merger agreement with a merchant banking firm in an
effort to head off a takeover attempt by Razorback Acquisition Corp.
   The announcement was made late Thursday after a meeting of the
Arkansas Best board of directors. The company said it had signed an
agreement with Kelso & Co. whereby Kelso would acquire Arkansas
Best's stock for $26 a share.
   That's $3 a share more than the most recent offer of Razorback
Acquisition.
   The board met to consider proposals relating to the acquisition
of the trucking and furniture company and found a ``white knight''
in Kelso & Co., a merchant banking firm with offices in New York,
Newport Beach, Calif., and San Francisco. Kelso specializes in
leveraged buyout transactions involving employee stock-ownership
plans.
   According to a news release, a Kelso subsidiary will acquire
Arkansas Best for $26 per share of common stock and $1,002.31 per
$1,000 principal amount of 7 percent convertible subordinated
debentures due 2011. The amounts will be paid in cash.
   The current offer by Razorback Acquisition, a New York-based
firm that incorporated specifically to take over Arkansas Best, is
$23 a share and $886.66 for each $1,000 convertible bond.
Razorback's first tender offer was for $20 a share.
   Arkansas Best's stock closed | higher Friday at $25.63 a share.
   In its offer, Kelso said it has high regard for the management
of Arkansas Best and agreed that it would maintain the company's
headquarters in Fort Smith. Kelso also said it would provide
employees with benefits which are about the same as those currently
provided by Arkansas Best.
   Under the merger agreement, a cash tender offer will be made for
all outstanding common stock and debentures of Arkansas Best.
   With its offer, Kelso submitted loan commitment letters from
Chemical Bank for $230 million and from First Boston Securities
Corp., an affiliate of First Boston Corp., for $120.62 million.
   The $45 million of common equity required for the transaction
will be provided by Kelso and its affiliates.
   Razorback Acquisition raised its tender offer after the Arkansas
Best board rejected the initial $20 offer as inadequate. The $23
offer was also rejected, but the board left the door open for
negotiations and last week signed a confidentiality agreement
allowing Razorback Acquisition access to non-public information
about Arkansas Best.
   The New York firm had said that it would consider raising its
current offer if it had access to the confidential information.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. has been fined
$100,000 for mishandling hazardous wastes and must submit plans by
the end of August for cleaning up an area near its overhaul base at
Kansas City International Airport.
   The fine was levied by the Environmental Protection Agency after
a consent agreement was reached in which the airline neither
admitted nor denied guilt.
   Violations cited by the EPA included dumping paint wastes into a
ditch in a ravine south of the overhaul base, failing to monitor
groundwater contamination, failing to have approved plans for
closing the waste site and monitoring it for pollution, and failing
to provide financial assurances for cleanup.
   TWA must also conduct environmental audits at Lambert-St. Louis
International Airport, Kennedy International Airport in New York
and Los Angeles International Airport.
   TWA was fined $250,000 by the state of Missouri two years ago
and ordered to establish a $500,000 scholarship fund at the
University of Missouri for illegally dumping hazardous wastes in
several pits at the overhaul base.

<HEAD>Insurance Commissioners Want to Dump Collision Waivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance commissioners from throughout the
country voted Friday to endorse model legislation to eliminate
collision damage waivers charged by car rental companies.
   Under the model drawn up at the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners conference, rental car companies would no
longer be able to sell collision damage waiver insurance and they,
not the customer, would be liable for any damage to a rental car.
   The model legislation is aimed at keeping car rental companies
from selling consumers insurance they do not need. The
commissioners believe that many car rental customers are covered
under their private auto policies.
   Nebraska Insurance Commissioner William McCartney, head of the
national group's Market Conduct Surveillance Task Force, said the
NAIC subgroup on rental car insurance began looking into the
problem more than a year ago.
   The investigation was prompted by hundreds of calls from
consumers who said they were talked into buying collision damage
waivers, known as CDWs, which cost an average of about $10 a day.
   McCartney said the group concluded the waivers were too
expensive, the contracts too vague and that they allow for such a
broad interpretation that the coverage may be worthless.
   The result is the proposal endorsed Friday at the end of the
week-long national conference held in New York.
   The primary drawback to the proposal is that rental companies
would likely hike basic rental fees to cover the cost of assuming
responsibility for damaged cars.
   McCartney said he hoped that would not be the case and that the
proposed legislation would ``protect consumers from the confusion
and abuses inherent in the current practices of selling CDWs.''
   The commissioners will now take the proposal back to their state
legislatures in hopes of having it enacted.
   ``We are definitely in support of legislation that would result
in the abolishment of CDWs and have been working with people on the
state level about this issue for some time,'' said Demetria Mudar,
a spokeswoman for Avis, based in Garden City, N.Y.
   ``We certainly endorse anything that moves us closer to the
elimination of CDWs all across the United States,'' said Joseph
Russo of Hertz.
   He said Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., was concerned that
some car rental companies ``were not treating CDWs as an option and
were in fact using coercion and intimidation, making it virtually
mandatory for customers to buy CDWs, instead of the option that it
should be.''
   Not all of the companies favored the proposal.
   Liz Clarke, of Alamo-Rent-a-Car, said the consumer would end up
paying in the end.
   ``No car rental company can absorb the full cost of damages to
its fleet without passing substantial increases in rental rates to
100 percent of its rental base,'' she said.

<HEAD>United Files Unfair Practices Complaint Against Japan Air Lines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines filed a complaint Friday with the
Department of Transportation charging Japan Air Lines with unfair
competitive practices for blocking Japanese travel agents from
using United's Apollo computerized reservations system.
   The complaint, filed in Washington, contends that JAL has
engaged in discriminatory and anti-competitive practices which
restrict United's access to Japanese markets for its Apollo system.
   ``While we regret that we have to take a step as serious as this
filing, we must protect our rights to do business in Japan,'' said
John R. Zeeman, United's executive vice president for marketing and
planning, in a statement released Friday.
   ``JAL's denial of access to United and Covia in Japan is
inconsistent with the basic principles of reciprocity and is
detrimental to the commercial relationship between the United
States and Japan,'' he said.
   Covia is the computer reservations subsidiary of UAL Corp.,
United's parent, and operates the Apollo system.
   Morris Simoncelli, JAL's deputy director for public relations,
said he was aware of the complaint, but the airlines' lawyers in
Washington had not yet seen it.
   ``We can't comment until we have a chance to look at it,'' said
Simoncelli, contacted by telephone at JAL's New York City office.
   United's complaint alleges that JAL has violated the
International Air Transport Association's Fair Competitive
Practices Act by refusing to permit Japanese travel agents to use
Apollo to write tickets on JAL in Japan.
   At the same time, there are no restrictions on JAL using its own
computerized reservation system, JALCOM, to write tickets on United
in Japan, said Rob Doughty, a United spokesman.
   He said U.S. travel agents were also free to issue tickets on
JAL using the Apollo system.
   United has been trying for more than two years to obtain the
rights to have Apollo issue tickets on JAL in Japan, but JAL has so
far refused to sign the international ticket-writing agreement
required by Japanese banks for settling payments from one airline
to another, Doughty said.
   The complaint contends that JAL's refusal to grant ticketing
authority to United preserves the Japanese carrier's domestic
monopoly for its own reservation system.
   Doughty said United's reservations system was ``more
sophisticated and offers more benefits'' than JAL's, but Japanese
travel agents were reluctant to purchase Apollo because they could
not use it to make bookings on JAL.
   The complaint did not specify how much United has lost in
potential revenue from JAL's practices, Doughty said.
   Doughty said United hoped that filing the complaint would lead
JAL to lift its restrictions on issuing tickets.
   If JAL remained intransigent, United would ask that the
Transportation Department impose ``forceful retaliatory action''
against JAL by barring it from using any U.S. computer reservations
system for booking and ticketing.

   California insurance regulators on Friday
denied Batus Inc.'s application to buy Farmers Insurance Group
Inc., dealing a potential death blow to the Kentucky company's $4.5
billion hostile takeover bid.
   Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said the decision was
based on a section of the state insurance code that forbids
ownership of an insurer by government agencies.
   ``There are governmental entities or agencies that together own
more than 10 percent of BAT's stock,'' Ms. Gillespie said in a news
release, referring to Batus' British parent, BAT Industries PLC.
   ``We're delighted,'' said Farmers spokesman Tom Welch.
   Batus announced that it would sue to have the decision reversed.
   ``Batus believes the department's interpretation is
unconstitutional and will promptly take appropriate legal action to
reverse the department's decision,'' the company said in a news
release. Farmers and many other California insurance companies
count government entities among their shareholders, said Batus
spokesman Wilson Wyatt.
   Government investors in BAT include British city councils and
pension funds and foreign governments, including some Arab
governments, Ms. Gillespie said. The government entities together
own more than 10 percent of the company but no one entity owns more
than 2 percent, she said. She didn't know the exact percentage of
government ownership of Batus.
   Management of Farmers, the nation's third-largest auto and home
insurer, opposes the takeover, which Batus has been pressing in a
3{-month tender offer of $63 a share for all outstanding Farmers
stock. Before the decision was publicized Friday, Batus announced
that holders of 28 percent of Farmers stock had offered to sell at
that price.
   If Batus were able to acquire a controlling interest in Farmers,
it would still need approval of insurance regulators in nine states
in which Farmers does business. California's approval was
considered pivotal, since Farmers is based in Los Angeles.
   Arizona, the only other state to rule on the matter, approved
Batus' application.
   Ms. Gillespie rejected to Farmers' arguments that Batus was
unfit to own an insurance company because it also owns cigarette
companies, she said in a telephone interview from her San Francisco
office.
   Nor was she swayed by a parade of elected state and municipal
officials who publicly denounced the takeover because BAT has
business interests in racially segregated South Africa.
   Farmers had suggested that its non-smoker discounts wouldn't
continue under Batus, and that tobacco product liability suits
could drain Batus' resources.
   ``We did take a look at those issues but we did not find against
BAT on those issues,'' she said.
   Aside from the government ownership, Batus met all the tests for
eligibility to own a California insurer, Ms. Gillespie said.
   She declined to speculate on the rationale for the prohibition
on government ownership of an insurer, but said the commission
staff always interprets the code to mean the 10 percent limit
applies to aggregate ownership by government entities.
   ``This narrow approach has always been the approach of the staff
in these cases,'' Ms. Gillespie said.
   Batus owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., maker of Kool,
Viceroy, Raleigh and Belair cigarettes and retailers including Saks
Fifth Avenue in New York.
   Farmers, with $11 billion in assets, is the nation's
third-biggest home and auto insurer and seventh-largest property
and casualty insurer.
   Batus had extended the deadline on its tender offer, which was
set to expire Thursday, until July 14.
