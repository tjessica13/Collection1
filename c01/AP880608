   The leftist government and U.S.-backed
rebels ended a second day of cease-fire talks late Wednesday,
softening earlier statements that disagreements were threatening
the negotiations.
   ``We discussed some substantial issues,'' rebel spokesman Bosco
Matamoros said at the end of the day-long talks. Asked if advances
had been made, he replied, ``I didn't say that.''
   Manuel Espinoza, the Sandinista government's information
minister, told reporters after the talks ended that the rebels
``recognized advances had been made.''
   Espinoza had painted a rosy picture of Tuesday's talks, only to
have his remarks disputed by the rebels. By midday Wednesday both
sides acknowledged problems.
   ``It has deterioriated, but it is pre-planned on the part of the
(Reagan) administration and the Contras,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco told journalists.
   He said there was a ``conspiracy to rupture the talks'' and
blame the breakdown on the Sandinista government.
   The rebels, known as Contras, accused the Sandinistas of being
evasive about when promised democratic reforms would be enacted.
   Meanwhile, police briefly detained 14 of about 30 members of
opposition political parties who held a march in downtown Managua,
the Interior Ministry said. Tinoco described the march as a
``provocation and violation of the law.''
   The Contras said no further talks on details of the cease-fire
plan signed March 23 would be held unless there is agreement in the
current, fourth round of talks.
   About the Contra charge of evasiveness on democratic reform,
Paul Reichler, a U.S. lawyer negotiating for the Sandinistas said:
``That's simply a lie and I won't be diplomatic about it.''
   He said the Contras were ``engaging in tactics'' to make it
appear the Sandinistas were unwilling to compromise and then to
seek U.S. military aid.
   On Tuesday, both sides reported headway on a government pledge
of democratic reforms, including freedom of the press, political
liberties, an end to Sandinista party control of the army, the
right to strike and changes in the electoral system.
   Contra delegate Roberto Ferrey said Wednesday, however: ``It is
not possible to continue a process in which one of the parts, the
Sandinista Front, has demonstrated that it does not have the
minimum desire to really seek a peaceful solution to the Nicaraguan
crisis.''
   Tension and mistrust have marked all the talks on ending the
war, which has lasted nearly seven years and taken almost 27,000
lives. Among the main snags are how to define democracy and the
timetable and mechanics of disarmament.
   Espinoza said Wednesday the government agreed to a Contra
request that humanitarian aid be delivered to the rebels in safe
areas by the Pan American Development Foundation, an agency of the
Organization of American States.
   Under the March 23 cease-fire agreement, aid can be delivered
after an independent verification commission certifies the rebels
have moved into seven designated zones. Representatives of the
Roman Catholic Church and OAS make up the commission.
   Espinoza said the government was sticking to its demand that the
rebel disarmament and return to civilian life be completed by the
end of September, but the Contras want that extended until the end
of January.
   Reichler claimed the Contra timetable was linked to the U.S.
election and inauguration of a new president to ``preserve a
military option.'' He called it ``one last role of the dice on a
Bush victory,'' referring to Vice President George Bush, the likely
Republican nominee.
   The demonstration Wednesday was called to protest a law that has
enabled the Sandinistats to close radio stations for broadcasting
what the government declares to be misingformation or unconfirmed
news about the war or military draft.
   Among those detained were Erick Ramirez, president of the Social
Christian Party.

<HEAD>Treaty Nations Recommend Mineral Development Of Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Countries overseeing Antarctica
have overruled environmentalist objections and recommended mineral
exploitation of the frozen continent, thought to be rich in gold,
oil, coal and other resources.
   Delegates agreed at the monthlong conference that ended last week
to lift a ban on development of Antarctica. The 100-page document,
called the Antarctic Minerals Convention, also expressed concern for
the Antarctic environment and contained provisions for its
protection.
   Chris Beeby, New Zealand's deputy secretary of foreign affairs
and chairman of the 20-nation group which approved the document
Thursday, said it offered the strongest protection possible for the
unspoiled Antarctic environment.
   However, Greenpeace and other non-governmental groups included in
the discussions claimed they were inadequate.
   The convention's provisions include creating an Antarctic
minerals resource commission to oversee the region's development.
   The United States, which was represented at the meeting,
estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum
reserves.
   The convention also contains provisions for clean-up operations
where necessary, must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of the
Antarctic Treaty's 20 members, including the seven which have land
claims in Antarctica.
   Beeby predicted the convention ``will go down in Antarctic
history as the most important political development regarding the
regulation of Antarctica since the Antarctic treaty itself was
adopted in 1959.''
   Conservationists, who pushed to have the region protected as a
``world park,'' disagreed.
   Greenpeace spokesman Roger Wilson said the agreement was reached
only by ``bludgeoning'' environmentally minded nations into
submission.
   Wilson said the convention looked good on paper but would not
protect the environment in practice.
   Beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will begin
soon.
   A moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 and
will remain until the convention is ratified, delegates said.
   Antarctica is double the size of the United States. Countries
with land claims are Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Chile, Norway,
Argentina and France.

   Avant-garde artists armed with video cameras
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art
designed to draw the viewer into the picture.
   ``People are captivated by this art form,'' said video artist
Mary Lucier. ``It screens out distractions. It draws you into a
completely new and different world. In that sense, it's kind of
like going to the movies.''
   A new exhibit, ``American Landscape Video: The Electronic
Grove,'' features work done in the past decade by seven leading
video artists, including Lucier.
   The show, on display through July 10 at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
Museum of Art, features bright moving images that appear on video
monitors illuminating darkened rooms.
   The videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds
call, a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging
amid crackles and pops. Eerie music plays as the camera peers up
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water.
   The artists placed rocks, trees and other objects around the
video monitors, which have screens up to 25 inches wide. In one
work, viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own
images in the still water of a reflecting pool. In another, a coil
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream.
   ``Each space creates its own environment,'' Lucier says. ``The
impact, I think, is greater than sculpture. There is the sound as
well as moving images and three dimensional objects.''
   Many people resist the concept of video art, assuming viewing it
would be like watching television, but they usually like the works
once they see them, said Bill Judson, film curator at the Carnegie.
   ``People come in and they see this and they say, `My God, I love
that,''' he said. ``They're astonished in themselves.''
   Video art began in the mid-1960s, when advances in technology
made black and white film equipment more affordable. In the early
'70s, museums began showing elaborate video displays, and some
artists used color computer-generated images in their work.
   In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney
Museum of American Art have displayed video works, but many smaller
museums can't afford the high cost of building the exhibits, Judson
said.
   ``There's a lot of great work being done, but it's just not
getting exposure,'' he said.
   In Lucier's ``Wilderness,'' three videotapes are shown
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals. She
filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century American landscape
artists such as Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, showing gleaming
icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky.
   One work, ``Room for St. John on the Cross,'' has a gyrating
image of mountain tops projected on a large sreen. In the center of
the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single window.
A voice reciting in Spanish can be heard, and a white-capped
mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the cube.
   Artist Bill Viola said the work is based on a Spanish mystic who
wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite
being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell.
   Doug Hall's ``The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described,''
features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire,
tornadoes whirling and storms at sea. Within the gallery, a steel
fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two
oversized, stainless steel high-backed chairs.
   In ``The Allure of the Concentric'' by Rita Myers, four monitors
amid large volcanic rocks show closeup views of leaves and weeds,
dry cracked ground and the silhouette of stark tree trunks against
sky.
   Frank Gillette placed eight eye-level monitors in a square,
showing reeds in a marsh, birds flying and other wildlife in the
wilderness north of Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Around the corner, the viewer stands in the center of a ring of
eight monitors showing natural and colorized images that Steina
Vasulka created of New Mexican mountains and the desert.
   In Dara Birnbaum's ``Will-O'-The Wisp,'' three monitors placed
in a panel show a woman amidst trees as a woman's voice speaks
about a former lover.

<TEXT>
   The auspicious date rolls around only once a
century _ 8@8@88 _ and it has number-conscious couples in Singapore
flocking to get married on that day.
   Engaged couples have already booked all 90 available slots at
the Registry of Marriages on Aug. 8. The registry has had to put up
a sign telling couples it has no more openings.
   Those being turned away have the option of joining more than 100
other couples in mass nuptials at a theater-restaurant that will be
staffed by registry officials.
   At least four hotels and six restaurants are fully booked for
Chinese wedding dinners on Monday, Aug. 8.
   The date is auspicious because Cantonese-speaking Chinese
pronounce the number eight ``paat,'' which sounds like ``faat,''
which means prosperity.
   Hence the belief that a date made up of all eights bodes well
for the future.
   Many of those who can't marry on Aug. 8 seek propitious
alternatives.
   The Registry of Marriages, which usually averages 43 marriages a
day, reports that Aug. 1 and 2 are proving popular as second
choices.
   The local usage of numerical dates places the day first followed
by month and year. So Aug. 1 appears 1@8@88. It is pronounced ``yat
paat paat paat,'' which sounds like once prosperous always
prosperous.
   Aug. 2, or 2@8@88, is pronounced ``yee paat paat paat'' _ easy
to be prosperous.
   Some of the betrothed want to cover two special dates. They plan
to marry on Aug. 8 but delay the wedding dinner until Sept. 18,
which in the lunar year, coincides with the eighth day of the
eighth moon.
   ``Sept. 18 was fully booked in November last year,'' said
Jessica Eng of the Cathay Restaurant.
   Millions in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and other
parts of Asia hold a deep respect for what they perceive as the
power of certain numbers, particularly older people whose beliefs
are strongly influenced by the traditions of China.
   While 13 is unlucky to Westerners, the number four, alone or in
a combination such as 24 or 44, is bad news for many Chinese
because in Cantonese it sounds like the word for dying.
   Numbers affect many things. Municipal officials say they receive
about 10 written and many oral requests each year from people who
want to change house numbers because the ones they have are unlucky.
   Applicants get a standard reply: no change is possible ``as this
will result in a haphazard system, abuse and impropriety.''
   Real estate agents say that if Chinese have a choice when buying
or renting property, they generally shun houses or apartments with
the number four. Some developers offer discounts when selling
condominiums with unlucky numbers, especially if the market is
sluggish.
   The auctioning of license plates with lucky numbers fetched the
equivalent of about $1 million in Singapore dollars in the last
three years for the Registry of Vehicles. Plates with multiple
number eights are special favorites.
   If Aug. 8, 1988 was not auspicious enough, this is also the year
of the dragon in the Chinese astrological cycle. Following a rabbit
year in the 12-year zodiac, the dragon is considered a mighty
creature that bestows blessings.
   A spokesman for the Population Planning Unit said it expects an
increase in births this year, children who will be known as dragon
seeds.
   Not everyone agrees that popular dates have much to do with
custom or traditional belief.
   ``The couples have departed completely from the Chinese almanac
in choosing these dates,'' said Lee Siow Mong, a retired educator
and president of the China Society. ``The traditional way is to
pick the proper date and time according to the almanac,''
   ``Personally, I think all this talk about 8@8@88 being lucky is
very stupid and baseless,'' Lee said in an interview with The
Straits Times newspaper.
   Nevertheless, Maggie Tay, who was told that all the Registry of
Marriage slots were taken on Aug. 8, still wants to go by the
numbers.
   ``It is a special day that comes along only once in a hundred
years,'' she said, adding that she was considering New Year's Day
as an alternative.
   ``Yat yat paat kow'' (1@1@89) sounds like ``everyday prosper
forever.''

<HEAD>Parliament Opposes Reinstatement of Death Penalty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons has voted by a wide margin
against restoring the death penalty, which was officially abolished
in Britain in 1969.
   By a 341 to 218 vote Tuesday night, lawmakers defeated a
resolution that would have empowered juries to recommend capital
punishment for any crime.
   It was the eighth failure to reinstate the death penalty in 19
years. Most previous attempts have called for execution for
specific crimes, including murder.
   All parties in the 650-member Commons allowed their members a
free vote, and loud cheers filled the packed chamber when the
result was announced after a 4{-hour debate.
   Roger Gale, a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
governing Conservative Party who launched this bid to restore the
death penalty, argued that it would deter would-be murderers.
   If the proposed measure ``were to have saved one life, that
would be worth the risk,'' Gale said. ``I do not seek vengeance. I
do not seek punishment. I seek solely a deterrent.''
   But Home Secretary Douglas Hurd criticized death penalty
advocates who ``take a remarkably broad brush approach to a power
of life and death.''
   ``The way to deal with violent crime is by strengthening the
police, stiffening sentences, building prisons and, equally
important, by reinforcing the self-confidence of all those who
influence, or should influence, the young in this country away from
violence,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher voted in favor of the measure.
   The drive to reinstate the death penalty received momentum from
a February newspaper survey showing that 43 of the 53 Conservative
members of Parliament elected for the first time one year ago favor
the return of hanging, the traditional British form of execution,
for premeditated murder.

<HEAD>In New Jersey and California, Dukakis Draws Reagan Democrats</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with California polls; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis drew Reagan Democrats back
to the fold in the California and New Jersey primaries Tuesday,
garnering support from a voting group whose choice will be critical
in the general election.
   About a quarter of the voters in the two primaries said they had
backed President Reagan in 1984, and nearly two-thirds of them said
this year they would favor Dukakis over George Bush, CBS News-New
York Times polls said.
   A Los Angeles Times exit poll of Republicans in California
contained other good news for Dukakis: only about a third of the
Republican voters viewed him unfavorably, far fewer than usual for a
candidate of the opposing party.
   Also, a sizable share of Democratic opponent Jesse Jackson's
voters viewed Dukakis favorably, an indication that Dukakis will be
able to win them over with relative ease, said Los Angeles Times
pollster I.A. Lewis.
   In the 1984 and 1980 Democratic primaries in California,
supporters of the losers were far more antagonistic toward the
winners, Lewis noted. ``Jackson voters are not unfavorable to
Dukakis,'' he said. ``So it won't be so hard for them to bind up
their wounds.''
   On the other side of the country, exit polls of New Jersey voters
said more Democrats considered Dukakis to be a strong and
experienced leader than in earlier contests, and more said they
supported him strongly.
   His strength of support was not as great in California, according
to preliminary poll results. But Dukakis' voters still valued his
experience and leadership more than generally was the case in
earlier races.
   The polls in California indicated that Dukakis and Jackson split
the liberal vote, a large segment of the Democratic electorate
there, while Dukakis won among moderates and conservative Democrats.
   The polls said Jackson won about a quarter of the white vote in
California _ one of his best showings among whites _ but only 9
percent in New Jersey, one of his worst showings with whites. He got
more than 90 percent of the black vote in both states.
   ABC News poll results from New Jersey said Dukakis continued to
appeal to Democrats across the ideological spectrum. He won
majorities of liberals, moderates and conservatives, and 56 percent
of all Democrats said his views were ``just about right'' as opposed
to too liberal or too conservative.
   In both California and New Jersey, about a quarter of Democratic
voters said they were not sure of Dukakis' ideology, less than in
earlier races but still an indication he was somewhat ill-defined,
said John Brennan, an ABC poll analyst. Still, Brennan noted, small
minorities of voters thought Dukakis too liberal or too conservative.
   That broad ideological appeal could be double-edged, Brennan
said: ``It's an indication he's run a moderate campaign. It also
indicates people haven't scrutinized him closely. He's all things to
all people.''
   The CBS-Times poll found that 54 percent of the Dukakis voters in
New Jersey supported him strongly, up from most earlier races. When
asked the most important qualities they considered, 43 percent said
experience and 41 percent cited strong leadership _ also increases
from earlier contests.
   In California, roughly half of the Dukakis voters had some
reservations about him, and fewer said they were strongly for him.
Still, experience and strong leadership were most often cited as
reasons for backing him.
   The strength of Dukakis' support in New Jersey ``could stem from
the fact that he's on a roll. He's got momentum'' from a string of
primary victories, said CBS News poll analyst Keating Holland. It
also could reflect a regional bias for a fellow Northeasterner, he
said.
   Although the electorate was racially polarized, 70 percent of
Jackson's New Jersey supporters told ABC they would vote for Dukakis
over Bush in November, while just 7 percent took Bush and 22 percent
said they would not vote. And while most Jackson voters wanted him
to be the vice presidential nominee, a slight majority in New
Jersey, 54 percent, said the choice should be left up to the
presidential nominee, ABC reported.
   ABC's polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage
points; the CBS-Times poll had a four-point margin, NBC's, 2 points.

<TEXT>
   It's an unproven legend that Betsy Ross made
the nation's first official flag. But there was little disbelief
among children at her house to start the celebration of the 211th
anniversary of the flag's adoption by Congress.
   A 22-by-45-foot replica of the 13-star flag was unfurled Tuesday
down the side of a building as 30 schoolchildren watched, waving
smaller versions of the flag.
   Just who was Betsy Ross?
   ``She was the one that made the first American flag,'' said Paul
Sherlock, 11, from St. Charles Borromeo School in Cinnaminson, N.J.
   ``By making the first American flag she was like the first real
American,'' said classmate Matthew Kozlowski, 11.
   Ross has received popular credit as the seamstress who made the
13-star flag that was adopted by the Continental Congress on June
14, 1777. The anniversary will be celebrated with a ceremony next
Tuesday _ Flag Day _ in front of the house in which Mrs. Ross
supposedly sewed the banner.
   William Kingsley, director of the house near Independence Hall,
feels there is enough evidence to give Ross credit for the flag. In
any case, he said, she remains an important woman in the nation's
history.
   ``We know she made flags for the Pennsylvania Navy and musket
balls for the Continental Army. She was involved in the life of her
country,'' Kingsley said. ``I think if you took away the incident
of the flag, she'd still be worth knowing.''
   Kingsley said the huge flag was made three years ago in the
courtyard of the house by employees of Humphry's Flag Co., located
across the street.
   On Monday, Greg Scott, a descendant of Mrs. Ross, will
participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the tomb of Mrs. Ross
and her third husband, John Claypoole, at a park next to the house.

   A severe storm packing 75-mph winds ripped
through Delaware Tuesday, downing trees, forcing the evacuation of
more than 500 people from a subdivision and causing power outages,
authorities said.
   At least 31 people were treated for mostly minor storm-related
injuries, Kent General Hospital in Dover reported.
   The storm swept through Cecil County in northeast Maryland,
before hitting Delaware between 4 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. It then headed
out to the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, said the National
Weather Service.
   The heaviest damage appeared to be in the Smyrna and Woodland
Beach areas, just north of Dover, where residents say they saw a
tornado. Jim Saunders, a meteorologist with the weather service at
the Greater Wilmington Airport, said there were 75 mph winds, but
tornado reports could not be confirmed before Wednesday.
   Authorities evacuated resident from about 200 homes in the
Greenmeadows subdivision here because of concerns of electrical
fires from exposed wires in damaged homes. A majority of the homes
suffered some kind of damage, said Smyrna Mayor George Wright.
   All but about a dozen families were allowed to return by late
Tuesday night, said Herm Bruce, spokesman for the Delaware Division
of Emergency Planning and Operations.
   In addition, at least one trailer was blown away and others were
damaged in the rural areas east of Smyrna.
   At Kent General Hospital, one person was admitted in fair
condition with injuries suffered in an auto accident during the
storm, said Jean Bochnowski, hospital spokeswoman.
   ``We have primarily minor injuries, lacerations, bumps and
bruises. There are no major injuries,'' said Robert Groom, another
hospital spokesman.
   The Boondocks restaurant near Smyrna had from $150,000 to
$200,000 in damages, according to owner Jack Keeler, who had been
fishing when the storm hit.
   ``Me and my friend were on the beach loading the boat into the
truck when we saw a big black twister,'' said Keeler.
   ``It was a great big cloud just twisting. And then all hell broke
lose. Everything was destroyed _ gone. The roof blew off (my
restaurant) and the windows blew out.''
   In Maryland, an inch of hail fell in Cecil County, said the
National Weather Service. But the state police in neighboring Kent
County, Md., which also borders Delaware near Smyrna, said they had
no reports of a storm.
   A police dispatcher in North East, Md., said trees were uprooted
throughout Cecil County and the way the trees were knocked to one
side near the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal may indicate a small
twister.
   The National Weather Service planned to survey the path of
destruction Wednesday to determine if it was a tornado, a spokesman
said.

   Michael Dukakis won the California
presidential primary Tuesday night and picked up more than enough
delegates to clinch a first-ballot nomination at the Democratic

   Joe the pig fled the bright footlights,
but a friendly farmer brought home the bacon after he found the
porcine cast member of a summer production wandering on his spread.
   The pig has been given a featured role in Grandview State Park's
annual outdoor production of the historical drama ``Hatfields and
McCoys.'' Joe will play the pig that sparked the legendary feud
between the mountain families along the West Virginia-Kentucky
border in the 1880s and 1890s.
   But on Sunday, the 5-week-old, 30-pound pig broke out of his pen
at the park and apparently began a trek to nearby Mossy, where he
was born and raised, Theater West Virginia prop manager Paul
Willard said.
   ``He missed his mother,'' Willard said.
   The crew was frantic, because Joe had no understudy and his role
was essential _ the Hatfield-McCoy feud began over ownershop of a
pig.
   ``We were in planning to hold auditions all next week,'' said
the theater's technical director, Tony Nye.
   On Monday, however, Bill Scott, a farmer who lives about half a
mile from the park, found Joe and started looking for the owner. He
read a newspaper article about the escape and contacted the theater.
   By Tuesday, Joe was back in the wings, awaiting rehearsals for
the show, which opens June 17.

   They almost ran out of gas and were pulled over for
speeding, but an expectant mother's race against time ended happily
when she gave birth to a screaming baby boy on the side of the road.
   ``The officer at first didn't think it was that critical,'' said
Judith Castro, 22. ``But if he hadn't pulled us over, I would have
had it on the highway on the way to the hospital, right there in
the front seat.''
   Ms. Castro gave birth at 5 a.m. Tuesday to 6-pound, 4-ounce
Michael Robert Fitzgerald in the back of a parked Palm Beach County
fire-rescue ambulance.
   The ordeal began at 4:30, when Ms. Castro was awakened by labor
pains. She woke her husband, John Fitzgerald, who dressed the
couple's two other children and then remembered their car was low
on gasoline.
   The hospital is only 6 miles north of their Lake Worth home, but
Fitzgerald drove 4 miles west, to the only service station he could
find open.
   ``Here I am going to have this baby and he's pumping gas,'' Ms.
Castro said. Fitzgerald sped away with a full tank, and the deputy
stopped them minutes later.
   No ticket was issued.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Lower Auto Fuel Economy Standards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators complied with Congress' intent when
they sought to spare the automotive industry economic hardship by
lowering fuel-economy standards, a federal appeals court says.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued
that ruling Tuesday in turning down a petition attacking the lower
1986 standards. The petition was filed by the state of California,
the cities of New York and Los Angeles, and four public issues
groups.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
``consideration of the likelihood of economic hardship within its
assessment of `economic practicability' must be given due weight,''
the court said in an opinion by Judge Ruth Ginsburg.
   The agency's decision was based on an analysis that concluded
the higher standard would have severe economic effects throughout
the auto industry, and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as
the petitioners alleged, the court said.
   NHTSA lowered the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE,
standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 27.5 mpg set by
Congress to 26 mpg. Standards for 1987 and 1988 were also lowered
to 26 mpg.
   Petitions also have been filed asking for review of the 1987 and
1988 standards. Con Hitchcock, an attorney for the public issues
groups, said they would reevaluate the petitions for 1987 and 1988
in light of the court's ruling.
   Although Congress set the standard at the higher level, it also
allowed NHTSA to set lower standards after considering economic
practicality, technological feasibility, the effect of other motor
vehicle standards, and the nation's need to conserve energy.
   The court rejected the petitioners' assertion that NHTSA failed
to consider energy conservation in adopting the lower standards.
   The agency had weighed increased fuel consumption against
economic harm under broad guidelines set by Congress.
   ``Had Congress offered a more precise balancing formula for the
agency to apply, ... we could more confidently discern the agency's
compliance with the congressional mandate,'' the court said.
   Lacking precise standards, NHTSA properly accommodated
conflicting policies in lowering the standard, the court said.
   Judge Abner Mikva joined Judge Ginsbug in the majority. Judge
Lawrence Silberman dissented in part.
   Public issues groups joining in the petition were Public
Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety, the Union of Concerned
Scientists and the Environmental Policy Institute.

<HEAD>EPA Says Testing Banned Pesticide Around Humans Is Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
will be safe to test a banned termite-killer in houses and other
occupied dwellings even though an environmental groups calls it
using humans as guinea pigs.
   ``We don't see it as human testing,'' says James Roelofs, EPA's
review manager for chlordane, a widely used chemical that EPA says
could pose long-term health risks, including cancer.
   Roelofs made the statement Tuesday after a watchdog group
criticized an EPA-approved plan calling for at least 150 residences
around the nation to be treated with the chemical.
   ``This amounts to EPA-sanctioned human testing of a pesticide,''
said Jay Feldman, national coordinator of the National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides.
   Under the plan, chlordane would be applied at unidentified test
sites at no cost to homeowners. Air inside the homes would be
monitored for two years to detect any levels of chlordane.
   Chlordane was used for 40 years to termite-proof an estimated 30
million dwellings, but sale of chlordane for residential
applications was halted last August under an agreement between EPA
and Velsicol Chemical Corp., the Illinois-based manufacturer of the
pesticide.
   EPA said detectable levels of chlordane inside houses raised
``concerns that long-term exposure to low levels of chlordane could
pose health risks, including an increased risk of developing
cancer.''
   The agreement halted chlordane sales by Velsicol until the
company could conduct further testing and show that no home
involved in the new study had detectable levels of chlordane in its
indoor air.
   Roelofs said the new tests will involve application methods that
are different from the traditional ways chlordane was applied.
   The chemical will be placed in the ground around a house or
under a concrete slab foundation, rather than being injected into
the concrete itself, according to Roelofs.
   ``There may be an element of risk (to the inhabitants) but we
have reason to believe it's low,'' Roelofs said. ``By eliminating
pressure injections and any injection inside the house, it's
possible there won't be any detectable levels. It's a reasonable
expectation.''
   Roelofs said EPA and Velsicol won't know whether the new
application methods produce indoor levels of chlordane ``until
there's been some testing.''
   He said the air-monitoring tests could be conducted at
unoccupied dwellings but that this was not proposed by either EPA
or Velsicol.
   ``We think it's within reason that if you don't put the material
in the house, it won't get into the house,'' Roelofs said.
``They're going to apply it in a way that's least likely to lead to
exposure.''
   Donna Jennings, Velsicol's public affairs manager, said the
company did not consider using unoccupied dwellings because
``there's no evidence to say chlordane is a human health hazard.''
   She said Velsicol reached the agreement with EPA rather than
face the drawn-out ``negative publicity'' that could accompany
fighting a formal EPA regulatory move against chlordane.
   Roelofs said the agency acted against chlordane because ``we
were being very conservative'' about the results of earlier tests
showing the chemical leached into indoor air.
   Jennings said the new testing won't begin until the company and
EPA settle the issue of whether the names of the participating
homeowners will be kept secret.
   ``We don't want them harassed,'' she said.
   Feldman says his organization wants the test locations made
public ``so that we can notify potential participants of the
hazards. ... People participating in what amounts to a human
testing experiment will receive no neutral objective information.''
   He said the information EPA wants Velsicol to give participants
``is weak and, when taken together with the other material Velsicol
plans to circulate, will leave potential participants in their
study with a distorted view of the risks that they face.''

<HEAD>Statue of Nearly Nude Indian Woman Stirs Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sculptor's plan to perch a statue of a
bare-breasted Indian woman on a bluff sparked a debate over art,
sexism and whether bronze can be voluptuous.
   Art won.
   Though four members of the Board of Selectmen approved the
placement of the statue high atop the hills overlooking Onset Bay,
the fifth opposed it last week.
   Selectman Joseph Grassia said he had concerns about the statue
because it will be in a public place and visible to children who
will see that ``she is fairly large-breasted.''
   ``Some say art, others will say nudity,'' said Grassia. ``I
wanted to see if it's an attack on the female.''
   The sculptor, A. Clayton E. Fuller, said the statue represents
the traditional Wampanoag Indian maiden in what would have been her
traditional summer costume _ a triangular loincloth that drapes
over one thigh.
   Wampanoags once called the Onset area near Wareham their summer
home, Fuller told selectmen. Their numbers eventually dwindled
because of famine, he said.
   ``I believe the piece is sufficiently discreet,'' said Fuller.
``She does have on her necklace, incidently.''
   Most other town officials agreed.
   ``If someone refers to that as sex, something is wrong,'' said
Selectman Donald L. Carlson of Fuller's creation. ``There are more
explicit photos to be found in National Geographic.''
   Selectwoman Sarah D. Woods said that although she received a
letter from a woman who was opposed to the statue's bare breasts,
she likes the sculpture and found it ``more handsomely beautiful
than pretty.''

<HEAD>OSHA Proposes More Protection for Workers from Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of workers would be exposed to
smaller concentrations of toxic chemicals on the job under the
first wholesale revision of federal occupational health regulations
governing the hazards.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Tuesday
proposed cutting job exposure limits for 234 toxic chemicals and
bringing 168 others under government regulation for the first time.
   ``This is a 20-year technological leap that brings the country's
basic occupational health regulations up to date,'' said OSHA
Administrator and Assistant Labor Secretary John A. Pendergrass.
   Officials estimated that the new exposure ceilings will reduce
job-related fatalities due to cancer, respiratory and
cardiovascular ailments and liver and kidney diseases by 500 a
year. Illnesses will fall by an estimated 55,000 annually, they
said.
   Approximately 3.6 million workers are now exposed to
concentrations of the chemicals above the proposed new ceilings,
OSHA officials said. They estimated the cost to industry of meeting
the new standards at $900 million a year.
   Some of the most widely used chemicals for which exposure limits
would be reduced are choloroform, carbon monoxide, hydrogen
cyanide, ammonia and trichlorethylene.
   Employers would have to meet the new standards six months after
the final regulations are approved.
   Pendergrass said approval of the regulations could come as
earlier as November. But he acknowledged that business opposition
to many of the changes is likely to surface in hearings scheduled
to begin next month or through court challenges later.
   OSHA officials said immediate compliance with most of the
proposed standards could be achieved through the use of personal
respirators. However, they added that the agency envisions
requiring the adoption of more expensive engineering controls such
as ventilation systems within four years.
   Pendergrass called the regulations ``the most significant
workplace exposure action taken by OSHA in its 17-year history.''
   Union officials endorsed the goal but complained that the
proposal requires no monitoring to assure that exposure ceilings
are not exceeded. They also noted that it excludes some toxic
chemicals such as beryllium, chromates and silica.
   ``We generally supported the project, but we're disappointed,''
said Diane Factor, an industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO. ``To
have an exposure limit without a monitoring requirement is like
ordering a 55 miles per hour speed limit without a speedometer.''
   Ms. Factor said, however, it is unlikely that the AFL-CIO would
challenge the standards in court.
   Randy Schumacher, director of health and safety for the Chemical
Manufacturers Association, said his group supports OSHA's approach
but added he anticipates challenges from companies to some of the
specific limits.
   ``This is a good one-time approach, but OSHA needs some kind of
mechanism that allows this to occur on a more routine basis,''
Schumacher said.
   The OSHA proposal sets exposure limits on a total of 428
chemicals, including the 234 for which the current ceilings would
be dropped and the 168 coming under federal regulation for the
first time.
   Current exposure limits would be reaffirmed for 25 more
chemicals, and a 10-fold increase in the exposure limit would be
allowed for one _ fluorine _ based on recent data, the agency said.
   OSHA has been criticized widely by both labor and management for
not having updated its exposure ceilings since the agency's
creation in 1971. Its attempts on a substance-by-substance
approach, such as with asbestos and benzene, have succeeded in only
24 cases.
   The agency estimates there are now more than 550,000 potentially
toxic chemicals and chemical compounds in the workplace.
   Most of the current federal exposure limits are based on
``threshold values'' established in 1968 by the American Conference
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists and adopted in 1971 by OSHA
as federal standards.
   Since then, the ACGIH and the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health have updated the threshold values or
recommended exposure limits on many of the chemicals, but the
changes have not been reflected in OSHA regulations.
   Pendergrass said most of the proposed new ceilings are based on
1987-88 data provided by the ACGIH with backup from NIOSH, an
agency of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   NIOSH-recommended exposure limits are actually lower than the
proposed new ceilings in many cases. But unlike the ACGIH and OSHA,
NIOSH does not consider feasiblity in its recommendations on
permissible exposures, Pendergrass said.

   The federal government's No. 2 health official
has selected 14 nurses for special recognition as a way to honor
the thousands who care for AIDS patients.
   In announcing his plans Tuesday, Dr. Robert E. Windom, the
assistant health and human services secretary for health, said
nurses ``have been the unsung heroes'' of the AIDS epidemic.
   He noted that physicians and research scientists, unlike nurses,
frequently come to public attention.
   Windom and other federal officials asked the American Journal of
Nursing and a number of local organizations to help select
individuals to represent nurses who care for AIDS patients.
   Although both private and public health officials say health
care workers who refuse to take care of AIDS patients are the
exception, they acknowledge that there are some nurses and others
who try to avoid AIDS patients _ apparently for fear of catching
the virus.
   ``I feel very strongly that nurses who are giving selfless,
dedicated care to people with AIDS have not received the
recognition they have merited,'' Windom said in a letter to the 14
nurses.
   Windom said each of the 14 has accepted an invitation to an
awards ceremony and luncheon in Washington on July 14.
   They are: Carol Price, Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn;
Mary Boland, director of AIDS nursing at Children's Hospital of New
Jersey, Newark, N.J.; Barbara Russell, Baptist Hospital, Miami,
Fla.; Tracey Castleman, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas

   President Najib of Afghanistan, in his
United Nations debut, threatened to seek a delay in the Soviet troop
withdrawal from his country if Pakistan continues its vigorous
support of anti-communist guerrillas.
   Najib also told a news conference Tuesday that more than 34,000
Soviet soldiers have left Afghanistan since May 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement calling for a complete Red Army pullout over
nine months.
   But Najib said his Marxist government could have the pace of
withdrawal slowed if neighboring Pakistan does not stop what he
called interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
   ``We want to visualize an optimistic situation,'' he said. ``But
should such violations acquire a permanent character ... in such a
case, we would certainly renew our consideration on the schedule of
withdrawal and take proper reactions, together with the Soviet
Union.''
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979. More
than 100,000 had until last month helped friendly governments fight
guerrillas backed by the United States, Pakistan and China.
   The guerrillas have repudiated the settlement signed April 14 in
Geneva. They reject Najib's government, refuse to join a coalition
government and vow to continue fighting Soviet and Afghan army
forces.
   On Tuesday, Western diplomats in Pakistan said Soviet troops are
delaying their pullout from Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest
city, which has been under siege by guerrillas.
   Najib, asked about Kandahar, indicated developments there have
not necessarily changed the withdrawal timetable, to which he said
his government is determined to adhere.
   In a bid to win legitimacy for his embattled government, Najib
delivered a 30-minute speech in the Dari language Tuesday to a
special General Assembly session on disarmament.
   Pakistan boycotted the speech and the United States, which does
not recognize the Kabul government, sent a young Foreign Service
intern instead of a ranking diplomat. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze and a high-level Soviet delegation attended.
   Asked about U.S. arms and support for the rebels, Najib noted
that the United States is a co-guarantor of the Geneva agreement.
   ``We expect the U.S.A., as a great, civilized and advanced
country to guarantee this internationally prestigious agreement and
not to destroy and spoil it,'' he said.
   In his speech, Najib said: ``In violation of the accords, camps
and centers for training of the extremist Afghan opposition still
exist on the territory of Pakistan. Huge amounts of arms are being
transported for subversion and terrorist activities in Afghanistan.''
   Najib told reporters that after Soviet troops withdraw, ``If the
interference from Pakistan is totally stopped, not only would the
(Afghan) armed forces resist but they would be able to give a rebuff
to the extremist forces of the opposition.''
   He said he seeks a broad coalition government, including Afghans
both within the nation and outside. Such a coalition would be viable
even without participation of the seven-party insurgents alliance,
which views the world ``through the barrel of a gun,'' he said.
   Najib declined, in answer to a question, to say whether he might
step down in an effort to achieve national reconciliation. He said
he had been elected by a traditional council of the Afghan people.
   Najib called on the international community, lending institutions
and the United Nations to contribute to economic reconstruction and
rehabilitation of Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan's state-run Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad,
Pakistan, said Prime Minister Mohammad Hasan Sharq announced his
24-member Cabinet on Tuesday.
   Sharq replaced Sultan Ali Keshtmand on May 26. The time gap
between his appointment and formation of a government fueled
speculation that Najib faced a deep split within the governing
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Najib is trying to hold together his Parcham faction, divided
between loyalty to him and to former President Babrak Karmal.
   Sharq's Cabinet returns Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoi, leader of the
party's opposition Khalq wing, to the Interior Ministry. Diplomatic
reports said Najib has been trying to push Gulabzoi out of the
government.

<HEAD>Whole-Herd Buyout Brought Temporary Leveling In Milk Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $1 billion in federal payments to
farmers aimed at reducing milk surpluses merely caused a temporary
leveling off of production, according to a report from the General
Accounting Office.
   ``While the program contracted to remove almost 9 percent from
annual milk production, nonparticipating dairy farmers continued to
increase their production,'' says the report from the congressional
investigative agency.
   It said that in 1986, the first year of the dairy termination
program, or whole-herd buyout as it is sometimes called, production
actually increased by 234 pounds or a fraction of one percent of
the 1985 level.
   Under the program, farmers agreed to slaughter or export their
entire herds and get out of dairying for at least five years in
return for payments from the Agriculture Department. The plan was
incorporated into the 1985 legislation approved in response to
painful stagnation that afflicted the farm economy at that time.
   Production dropped below the 1985 level by about half of one
percent in 1987, according to the GAO report, which was produced at
the request of two members of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   The leveling off came at a time of increasing demand for dairy
products and thus lowered surplus levels.
   The report said federal purchases of surplus dairy products
decreased from 13.2 billion pounds in 1985 to 10.6 billion pounds
in 1986. They dropped to 6.7 billion pounds last year, according to
the report.
   Some $1.8 billion was paid out by the government for the
program. But $677 million of that was defrayed by farmers through
assessments.
   Pressure to cut federal purchases of surplus dairy products had
been building because of increasing costs. The price tag for
taxpayers climbed from about $247 million in fiscal 1979 to a high
of $2.7 billion in fiscal 1983.
   In the mid-1980s, the government experimented with a milk
diversion program that also was designed to reduce federal
purchases of surplus milk. Under it, USDA paid 38,000 of the
nation's 200,000 commercial milk producers to cut back sales by 5
percent to 30 percent. The results were not successful.
   In the first year of the diversion, 1984, U.S. production was
135 billion pounds, of which the government bought 8 billion
pounds. In 1985, production was 143 billion pounds and the
government purchased 13 billion pounds.
   In key dairy states, milk production rose sharply during the
course of the program. In California, production increased 2.8
percent in 1986 and 6.9 percent in 1987. In Texas, it was 3.0
percent in 1986 and 8.4 percent in 1987.
   The GAO said that it sent out questionnaires to 650 dairy
farmers who sought to participate in the program and were not able
to do so and 545 of those whose bids were successful.
   About half said they were greatly prompted to get into the
program because doing so would prove more profitable than
continuing dairy operations, the GAO said. It said half reported
they were ``somewhat to very greatly influenced by the need to get
out of debt.''
   Of those who did participate and received the payments, 48
percent reported they are now crop producers, 44 percent maintain
livestock operations, 2 percent work for dairy farmers, 15 percent
do other farm-related work, 28 percent do non-farm related work, 5
percent are unemployed but seeking work and 9 percent jobless and
not seeking work.
   About 26 percent of the participants in the program said that
they either definitely would return to dairying after five years,
probably would do so or were just as likely as not to do so.
   ``Twenty-six percent of the program's participants indicated
that they probably would have quit dairying without the program,''
the GAO said. ``About 40 percent of th farmers who bid on the
program believe it will have little or no effect on milk production
at the end of 5 years.''

   Legislation that would block further Farmers
Home Administration loans to farmers who have defaulted on earlier
ones is being promised by Rep. Joe DioGuardi, R-N.Y.
   ``Everyone knows you don't lend money to someone who failed to
pay you back for an earlier loan,'' DioGuardi said in a statement
issued Monday. ``Everyone but the federal government that is.''
   He cited a Farmers Home Administration estimate that it would be
forced to write off $8.8 billion in defaulted loans under
legislation that was approved by Congress last year. He said,
however, that could mean borrowers would immediately become
eligible for new loans.
   ``To open up the credit window to these same debtors who cost us
the $9 billion in the first place makes absolutely no sense,'' the
Westchester County lawmaker said. ``In addition, allowing farmers
to write off their debts with impunity destroys the incentive to be
a good farmer.''
   Several lawmakers, notably Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.Y., have been
hotly protesting both FmHA's statement that it may have to write
off $8.8 billion and news media accounts that accept that statement
uncritically. They note that last year's legislation calls for
writing off such debts only in cases in which that way would be the
least costly to the taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein of Jordan has made an
unprecedented appeal to Arab summit members to support the
Palestinian uprising in Israel, comparing the riots and bloodshed
to Algeria's war of independence with France.
   Hussein, often accused by Arab hardliners of opposing the
Palestine Liberation Organization, called the 6-month-old uprising
in the Israeli-occupied lands ``the path to liberation and
dignity.''
   ``We extended to our Algerian brothers all the support that we
could as they struggled heroically ... to grasp their freedom from
ugly colonial occupation,'' he said after the emergency meeting of
Arab leaders opened Tuesday.
   ``Just as the Algerian revolution united Arabs, the Palestinian
revolution on the occupied Palestinian soil is uniting our
feelings,'' he declared.
   Algeria won independence in 1962 after seven years of bitter
struggle.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat in his remarks to the summit vowed to
keep up the uprising and inspire more riots until victory.
   He reiterated the PLO's traditional demands, ``the right to
return (to Palestine), the right to self-determination and right to
create an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.''
   The three-day meeting of the 21-nation Arab League was convened
to support the Palestinian insurrection.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the June 1967 Six-Day War. Since anti-Israeli riots began
on Dec. 8, more than 200 Palestinians and two Israelis have been
killed.
   Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid adjourned the meeting, which
was to resume today behind closed doors. As the Arab League's
secretary-general, Benjedid is summit chairman.
   Hussein met before the summit with Arafat, who also met with
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd.
   A Palestinian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Hussein-Arafat meeting ``was very warm and exceptionally
friendly.'' Their relations became strained after Hussein suspended
his efforts to work jointly with the PLO for a settlement with
Israel in February 1986.
   Bendjedid opened the summit by saying recognition of the PLO was
``the key to any settlement of the Middle East problem.''
   The United States and Israel both refuse to recognize the PLO as
spokesman for the Palestinians. Israel regards the PLO as a
terrorist organization.
   Summit sources said Arab leaders were discussing financial
support for the uprising in the range of $300 million to $400
million to compensate for loss of income caused by strikes.
   Other subjects likely to be raised at the summit include the
nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and the return of Egypt to Arab
League. Egypt was expelled after signing a peace agreement with
Israel, brokered by then-President Carter.

<HEAD>Representative Says Agency Punishing Agents Who Wrote Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Investigators are reviewing allegations that
the Immigration and Naturalization Service retaliated against
agents who complained that an administrative assignment put their
undercover identities in jeopardy and that they were told to
falsify their time cards.
   The alleged reprisals began after all eight agents in the
Houston anti-smuggling unit told Congress they were being
reassigned part of the time to contact employers about the new
immigration law and sanctions for hiring illegal aliens.
   They were allegedly told to record those duties as
anti-smuggling work on their time cards.
   U.S. Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas and chairman of the House
Government Operations Committee, contends the agents' safety was
threatened when they had to meet employers who may have been hiring
illegal aliens.
   ``I'd hate to be an undercover agent traveling around and
visiting those big employers of aliens. They'd recognize you; you'd
stand out like a sore thumb,'' Brooks said.
   But INS Commissioner Alan Nelson said it is ``ludicrous'' to
claim the agents' cover was blown by meeting with employers. Nelson
said he's ``not aware there's any truth'' to the allegations about
the time cards.
   ``It's a basic and simple case of insubordination and failure to
follow directions that started the whole thing,'' Nelson said. ``It
is our belief that they failed to perform their duties and
appropriate action took place.''
   Nelson said it was necessary nationwide to shift manpower to
accomplish the visits with employers, but apparently the men in
Houston were the only ones who ``just didn't want to do it.''
   Brooks said the agents have continued to suffer, although a
source said members of the unit were reassigned this week to
full-time anti-smuggling duties.
   Brooks said he requested a General Accounting Office
investigation in April because although the INS is ``treading a
little more carefully until the heat dies down'' its top-ranking
officials ``in their minds think they have done nothing wrong.''
   ``On rare occasions you find overzealous administrators who
cover up their mistakes by persecuting the people who talked about
it, but never have I seen it with the terrible dangers this one
reflects for the participants,'' said Brooks.
   The Office of Special Counsel, an independent investigatory
agency of the Merit Systems Protection Board, is also
investigating, said Laura Baumgaertner, executive assistant.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he has looked into the
situation and received ``wholly inadequate replies from the
agencies involved.''
   ``We don't need an INS whitewash, we need an objective
assessment of the facts. Then we will know what other steps, if
any, we need to take,'' Bentsen said Tuesday.
   After the agents complained in a letter Sept. 12 to Brooks, the
INS Southern regional office in Dallas began an investigation of
the agents, which Brooks contends violated the agency's own rules
that its office of professional responsibility conduct such a probe.
   ``In essence, the agents' allegations of impropriety were being
handled by those they had complained about. ... The Immigration and
Naturalization Service has demonstrated that it cannot fairly and
impartially evaluate itself,'' he said.
   The Justice Department's office of professional responsibility,
however, concluded in March that the INS investigation was not
improper.
   After they wrote Congress, four of the eight agents received the
lowest of three possible ratings _ not recommended for promotion.
One was given the middle rating _ recommended for promotion _ which
is also considered unfavorable. Three were given the highest rating
_ highly recommended for promotion. The five who received the
unfavorable ratings were cited for a lack of loyalty to the
service, Brooks said.
   One of their supervisors, Charles Griggs, has been stripped of
his supervisory duties and assigned full-time to contacting
employers by phone about the new immigration law. Griggs was named
in 1983 as one of the nation's Top 10 law enforcement officers by
the International Chiefs of Police and Parade magazine _ the only
INS officer to receive the award.
   The other supervisor, Jamar Hayes, was downgraded and
transferred to California. And Larry Granelli, the regional
director of the INS office of professional responsibility in El
Paso, was apparently reassigned after questioning the propriety of
the INS investigation of the agents.
   One of the four agents who was not recommended for promotion is
Fred Capio, who in 1986 receieved from Nelson the Commissioner's
Award for Heroism. Capio also served for two years in Vietnam and
received the Bronze Star.

<HEAD>The Primaries Are Over _ But The Campaign Goes On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 presidential primaries are over, but
Michael Dukakis and George Bush are still campaigning, now seeking
party unity at the summertime conventions in Atlanta and New
Orleans and into the fall.
   Both nominees-to-be are reaching out in the next few days to the
men they defeated in the 39 primaries, seeking to heal any wounds
and to avoid any new squabbles. And part of that process will be
their choice of vice presidential running mates for the general
election.
   Bush joins four of his five former Republican rivals for a
``Unity '88'' meeting in Denver on Friday, the first of several
such meetings to lay the groundwork for the GOP National Convention
in New Orleans Aug. 15-18.
   Dukakis, his final primary victories in hand, gathers the formal
backing of some former Democratic rivals today. He will stop in St.
Louis on the way home from California to receive the endorsement of
Rep. Richard Gephardt, while Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois will add
his support in a statement.
   ``I don't see any great divisions within our party,'' Dukakis
said before the votes were counted Tuesday. ``We're going to have
ourselves a great convention.''
   For the Massachusetts governor, the first challenge is Jesse
Jackson.
   The preacher-turned-politician has been Dukakis' most persistent
opponent, hanging on to the end of the primaries and promising to
continue all the way to the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta July 18-21.
   ``Suffice it to say, we're going to keep our campaign alive to
July, at the convention,'' Jackson said in Los Angeles.
   Jackson has stepped up his pressure on the Massachusetts
governor in the closing hours of the season _ on the vice
presidency and on the issues. In his strongest statement yet,
Jackson suggested he had earned at least an offer of the No. 2 spot
on the ticket.
   ``If he were to win, extending the invitation to me is his
option,'' Jackson said of Dukakis. ``It is an option my
constituency has earned.''
   Dukakis brushed aside such comments, noting that Jackson has
said that it is up to the nominee to select a running mate. And he
also claimed to be unconcerned about the possibility of fights at
the convention on issues Jackson thinks are important.
   ``We may have a floor fight or two,'' Dukakis said. ``There may
be some issues that go to the floor.''
   But Jackson was conciliatory as well after a meeting Monday
night with Dukakis.
   ``He's sensitive on these matters and we're going to have some
follow-up meetings, necessarily to discuss matters of platform,
credentials, rules, the convention itself, and beyond that, our
strategy for winning in November,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson aides said he would remain in California for a week of
rest, resuming appearances next week. And campaign manager Gerald
Austin has talked of strategy sessions in the middle of the month,
with Jackson continuing to campaign through the convention.
   For his part, Dukakis will campaign remarkably hard for the next
six weeks.
   He says he will spend three days on the road in each of the
coming six weeks, touching base in key states for the fall. The
rest of the time he will spend in his Statehouse office in Boston
or in campaign briefings.
   The Massachusetts governor will travel this weekend to Utah to
speak to the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   His first extended trip is planned for next week, with a major
tour of the South. Stops in North Carolina, Texas, Georgia and
Florida are tentatively scheduled in the region judged a stronghold
for Bush in the fall.
   Dukakis may run into Jackson on one of his stops, when he visits
the Texas state convention June 18.
   Later Dukakis will touch on economic themes on a tour of
industrial states at the end of the month.
   The Denver unity meeting is the first of at least three such
sessions planned by the Republican National Committee, which is
picking up the bill. One is scheduled later in June in Cincinnati
and another early in July in Atlanta.
   Of Bush's onetime rivals, only Pat Robertson is not confirmed
for the Denver unity session Friday and Saturday.
   Republican officials said Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and former
Secretary of State Alexander Haig have all agreed to attend.
   With more than two months to go before the GOP convention, Bush
finds his campaign strapped for cash, with only about $1.3 million
left to spend before hitting the federal ceiling on primary
spending.
   But his aides have put together a variety of events _ to be paid
for by the party or other GOP candidates _ to keep the vice
president on the road and in the news at party fund-raisers and
conventions across the country.
   Bush will not receive his federal allotment of $46.1 million
until after the August convention, while Dukakis _ whose campaign
is in better financial shape at the moment _ will receive his money
in late July after the Democratic meeting.

<HEAD>AIDS Panel Endorses Chairman's Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the White House AIDS
commission says he senses momentum building in Congress for passage
of a federal law protecting people infected with the AIDS virus.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins made that observation Tuesday
night as the panel tentatively endorsed most of the 579
recommendations he presented last week _ including the linchpin
call for anti-discrimination legislation.
   He said he has received encouraging letters from ``both sides of
the aisle.''
   ``There is a feeling of momentum in Congress,'' he said, adding
that passage of anti-discrimination legislation ``is something that
can be done in this session of Congress. I don't know that it will
be.''
   Watkins' comments came as he urged the commission to agree with
his plan to give top priority to the anti-discrimination issue in
the introduction of the final report due at the White House June
24. The Reagan administration has opposed such legislation.
   Among the other recommendations the panel agreed to emphasize at
the forefront of its final report:
   _That all of those infected with the AIDS virus _ an estimated
1.5 million Americans compared to less than 70,000 actually
diagnosed with the full-blown illness _ should be considered part
of the epidemic.
   _That intravenous drug abuse is a national emergency that must
be successfully dealt with if the AIDS epidemic is to be curtailed.
   _That the fight against the disease will require private as well
as government resources.
   _That compassion for those with AIDS should be emphasized at all
levels.
   Just as Watkins' prediction last week that most of his
recommendations reflected the full panel's consensus proved true,
so did his guess that his final chapter _ which he emphasized had
not undergone advance discussion _ would run into opposition.
   That was where he called for legislation to vest sweeping new
powers in the surgeon general _ currently Dr. C. Everett Koop _ to
deal with national medical emergencies.
   Watkins said immediately after approval of such legislation,
President Reagan should proclaim AIDS such an emergency and put
Koop in charge of dealing with it.
   The commission did not reject those suggestions outright, but it
was clear they do not have broad backing.
   The issue of what _ if anything _ to recommend in the way of
administrative changes to deal with AIDS, as well as future
epidemics, was put off to next week when the commission meets
Thursday and Friday.

<HEAD>Salvadoran President's Has Operation; Cancer Called Terminal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte will
probably undergo chemotherapy to treat the cancer that has spread
from his stomach to his liver, but Duarte's personal physician says
the malignancy is terminal.
   Duarte underwent three hours of cancer surgery Tuesday at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in which doctors removed a portion of his
stomach but left his diseased liver alone.
   ``There was metastatic disease present in both lobes of the
liver, and this was not removed,'' a hospital statement said.
   ``That is going to end the life of President Duarte,'' said Dr.
Benjamin Interiano, Duarte's personal physician. He said the
average life expectancy for someone in Duarte's condition is six
months, but some patients live longer, others shorter.
   Following Duarte's recuperation from surgery, ``this disease
will probably be treated with chemotherapy,'' the hospital
statement said.
   Duarte, 62, ``tolerated the surgery well,'' it said, describing
the operation as ``uneventful.''
   The Salvadoran leader, who was hospitalized here May 31, will
remain in intensive care for a few days before returning to his
regular hospital room for convalescence. Duarte's family members
were at the hospital.
   Duarte, one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin
America, is in the final year of a five-year presidential term.
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount is serving as acting
president of El Salvador in Duarte's absence.

<HEAD>McKinney's Widow Calls for Strong AIDS Position in GOP Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of the late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney,
a Republican who became the first member of Congress known to have
died from AIDS, is urging the GOP to put a strong election-year
statement on battling the deadly disease in the party's platform.
   ``A Republican platform devoid of a major commitment to solving
the problems of AIDS would send a clear signal to the American
people that the Republican Party wants to bury its head in the sand
and not confront one of the major issues of our day,'' Lucie
McKinney told Republican officials Tuesday at a platform hearing on
social issues.
   ``If the Republicans are going to present themselves to the
American people as the party of compassion, then we as a party
cannot fail to put forth a responsible policy on AIDS,'' she said.
   Mrs. McKinney has become an outspoken advocate of spending and
research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the death
last year of her husband, a nine-term congressman from Connecticut.
   ``AIDS doesn't only touch people in big cities. ... It is
affecting people right in our home towns, people we know, people we
grew up with, people we work and live with. People just like us,''
she said.
   Mrs. McKinney said the party platform should include pledges to
increase spending for AIDS counseling for patients and families,
expand the availability of test drugs, fight AIDS discrimination by
employers and insurance companies and support AIDS residences that
can help care for patients.
   ``I don't want our platform to be silent on (AIDS) education
because it might offend some people,'' said Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., R-Conn. ``I don't want to hear any rubbish that if you educate
you're teaching people to be drug addicts or teaching people to be
homosexuals.''
   The platform hearing was called at the request of Weicker after
domestic policy platform hearings were scheduled for Kansas City.
Weicker and other GOP liberals and moderates felt the scheduling
was an attempt by conservatives to push social issues such as AIDS
and homelessness to the background.
   John Buchanan, a former Republican congressman from Alabama and
chairman of People for the American Way Action Fund, a liberal
advocacy group on constitutional issues, warned that the GOP was
slipping away from mainstream voters.
   ``Will we be the party of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower,
or the party of Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly?'' Buchanan said.
   AIDS is an incurable condition that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   McKinney's doctor said he probably contracted the AIDS virus
from blood transfusions during heart surgery in 1979. But published
reports following his death said McKinney had homosexual relations.
   Asked if the newspaper reports about homosexual encounters were
true, Mrs. McKinney has said she didn't know of any.
   As of June 6, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 36,255 have died, according to the CDC. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
   An advocacy group is calling on members of
Congress to do more to help black South African children, saying
they will be hurt by stronger U.S. economic sanctions against the
segregated nation.
   The Wake Up America Coalition dramatized its ``Operation
Heartbreak'' campaign on Tuesday by arranging for groups of black
children to visit congressional offices.
   Some supporters of tougher sanctions, intended to pressure the
white minority government in Pretoria into granting more freedoms
to blacks, expressed skepticism about the group's motives.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., called the campaign a ``a front
for one of the many South African supported and funded groups.
There is no question in my mind that this is designed to develop
opposition to the (sanctions) bill.''
   But the Rev. Kenneth Frazier, chairman of the coalition, said,
``No matter what political side you're on, anti-sanctions,
pro-sanctions, anti-sanctions, it doesn't matter.
   ``We are here in the interest of millions of suffering black
South African children who are already the poorest and the most
helpless and the most vulnerable in South Africa (who will) be
further harassed ... and suffer all the more with a further round
of U.S. sanctions,'' he said.
   ``We are tired of seeing black and brown children the world over
always carrying the political burdens and consequences of these
irrational struggles for power among politicians East and West.''
   Fraizer maintained that the campaign was not inspired by the
vote on the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1988 scheduled for
the end of June. He said his position is based on his own trips to
South Africa.
   ``They are caught between apartheid and U.S. sanctions which
represent another form of hostility and oppression,'' he said of
the country's blacks.
   The coalition is delivering dolls of black children to
congressional offices, accompanied by letters appealing for
contributions to help feed and clothe black South African children.
   The letters ask recipients to donate $300 a year each to
``personally sponsor a child's food and clothing for as long as
U.S. sanctions legislation is in effect or until apartheid is
totally dismantled.''
   The letters also ask for a statement of support by June 21 ``so
that we can brief your constituents on where you stand.''
   Dymally said such tactics constitute political intimidation.
   ``This is designed to intimidate liberals and to solidify the
opposition of the right,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tony Ratings Victim of `Short Circuit'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a boffo year for Broadway ticket
sales, but television viewers were apparently unimpressed, giving
the annual Tony Awards show its lowest TV rating yet, according to
the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   NBC put ``Short Circuit,'' a sci-fi comedy movie, opposite
Sunday night's two-hour live Tonys show and racked up a top-10
performance. The Tonys ranked 42nd.
   Last year, the Tonys had a rating of 11.9 and a 23 share, barely
above the 1977 all-time-low of 11.3. But this year's show had only
a 9.5 rating and a 17 share.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   Other first-run specials also failed to draw big ratings even
though viewers had little original programming to choose from.
   The only other non-repeat in the top 20, except for ``60
Minutes,'' was the National Basketball Association playoff game
between Boston and Detroit on CBS. It tied for 20th. The Los
Angeles-Dallas game tied for 36th.
   CBS also had the American Film Institute salute to Jack Lemmon,
with a 10.5 rating and 19 share. It ranked 31st. ``Liza Minnelli: A
Triple Play'' on ABC ranked 44th with a rating of 9.2 and a 16
share.
   NBC, which had the top seven shows, won the week that ended
Sunday with a 12.9 average rating; CBS rated 9.8; ABC 9.3. The
three-network share was only 59, compared with the season-to-date
average of 70, typical of the summer months. NBC's season-to-date
average rating is 15.7, ABC 13.2, and CBS 13.1.
   In news, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' extended its winning
streak to six weeks. Its average rating last week was 9.2 and
earned a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' remained in second, at
8.5 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News,'' which has trailed since the fall,
had 8.3 and 18.
   The week's top 10 prime-time shows were: ``Night Court,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``Cheers,'' ``A Different World,'' Short Circuit,''
``L.A. Law,'' and Stranded,'' all on NBC, followed by ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC, ``The High Price of Passion'' NBC and ``Perfect
Strangers Special,'' ABC.
   ``Stranded'' and ``The High Price of Passion'' were repeats of
made-for-TV movies.
   ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd'' are numbered on NBC after
the show dropped into the bottom 10. Rock star David Bowie doesn't
appear to have a future in network television after his first-run
special on ABC was in the bottom five.
   The bottom 10 shows of the week were: ``West 57th,'' ``Perfect
Strangers,'' a Lyndon LaRouche paid political message, ``Ohara,''
``Molly Dodd,'' ``The Incredible Ida Early,'' ``David Bowie's Glass
Spider Tour,'' ``Probe,'' ``The Liberators, Part One,'' ``Dark
Crystal.''

<HEAD>New Cyclotron Can Fire `Atomic Cannon Balls'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's most powerful cyclotron has just
passed a crucial test, showing it can fire atomic ``cannon balls
instead of BBs,'' and stands ready for some of the most promising
experiments ever proposed by nuclear physicists, the National
Science Foundation said today.
   The NSF said scientists at the government-funded National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University
succeeded Monday in bending a narrow, high-energy beam of neon
nuclei so that it flew out of the cyclotron cleanly and hit a
stainless steel target.
   That success, the NSF said, means the K800 cyclotron is ready
for a series of atom-smashing experiments that could guide
physicists to fundamental rules governing subatomic matter. It is
hoped the studies eventually will lead to a better understanding of
the forces directing cosmic events, such as the explosions of
stars, or supernovas.
   The energy of the test beam fired this week was 360 million
electron volts, but the machine is capable of accelerating nuclei
to energies approaching 8 billion electron volts. By comparison,
the world's second most powerful heavy-ion cyclotron, GANIL in
Caen, France, has accelerated beams to energies of 4 billion
electron volts.
   The U.S. test means that precision beams of heavy nuclei can now
be directed into laboratories at the East Lansing, Mich., facility
for use in further experiments, the NSF said.
   Scientists generated the K800 cyclotron's first high-energy beam
in February, using its superconducting magnet to accelerate
electrically charged helium and carbon nuclei in a tight spiral.
Within the 7-foot-diameter confines of the cyclotron's magnetic
field, the nuclei gradually attained a speed of more than 60,000
miles per second. The latest test succeeded in targeting a beam
consisting of the cores of heavier atoms, opening the door to a
wider array of discoveries.
   ``The K800 is unique for both the intensity and the uniformity
of the beam of nuclei it can generate,'' said Henry G. Blosser, who
originated the superconducting accelerator concept and who
co-directs the facility along with MSU physics professor Sam Austin.
   Blosser said the machine, for which construction began in 1980,
``can accelerate a beam of nuclei of even the heaviest naturally
occurring element, uranium, to speeds that will lead to nuclear
reactions that have never been observed before.''
   ``In comparison with pre-1980s cyclotrons, it's like being able
to accelerate cannon balls instead of BBs,'' he said.
   When a heavy nucleus in the cyclotron beam approaches the
nucleus of a target atom with sufficient speed to overcome their
electrical repulsion _ or about 20,000 miles per second _ the
nuclei can come together and overlap for an instant. The
overlapping nuclei might fly apart almost unchanged, might eject
neutrons and protons to form a more stable combined nucleus, or
might even break up into a number of medium-sized fragments.
Scientists expect more than 30 nuclear particles to be emitted in
some of the more violent collisions.
   A complex array of electronic radiation detectors linked to
computers will record the outcome of the collisions. Physicists
hope that by studying the effects of temperature, pressure and
energy of impact, they will be able to define fundamental
relationships governing nuclear matter and reactions, similar to
the thermodynamic and quantum mechanical equations that have been
established for chemical reactions among molecules.
   Austin said the collisions of heavy nuclei will lead ``to
extremes of density and temperature as great as those that cause
stars to explode, and which occurred in the `Big Bang' that created
the universe.'' Experiments with the new cyclotron may possibly
even lead to the creation of new, heavier atomic elements, he said.
   While cyclotrons and other particle accelerators are designed
and operated primarily for physics research, the chemical isotopes
and radioactive elements that can be produced are also used in
medical research and treatment.
   The NSF has supported cyclotron research at MSU since 1961. An
earlier model, the K500, went into operation in 1982 and has been
host for more than 275 scientists from 47 institutions. It was the
first superconducting cyclotron in the world, using, like the
sister K800, titanium-niobium alloy magnets which lost all
resistance to electricity when chilled with liquid helium to minus
450 degrees Fahrenheit, near absolute zero. The 1988 operating
budget for the entire laboratory is $7.1 million.

   A North Korean official said today he
defected because he could not fulfill government orders to obtain
counterfeit American dollars for clandestine operations.
   Kim Chong Min, 44, told a news conference he was ordered to
obtain $500,000 in bogus bills for use in foreign operations. Kim
said he never found out what the money was for and was censured
when he tried to ask.
   Kim also said he defected because he failed to meet an order to
raise $2 million in real American currency to finance North Korean
government construction projects.
   South Korean officials said Kim was head of the state-run
Taeyang Trading Co. Kim said previously he served in the Ministry
of Public Security for 19 years and rose to the rank of lieutenant
colonel.
   The ministry is responsible for state security and espionage
operations in the communist north. The two Koreas, divided since
1945, are bitter foes.
   Kim said his company was ordered to raise foreign currency by
buying cobalt and other minerals in Zaire and Nigeria to be resold
for profit in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Unable to make profits or obtain bogus bills, Kim said he
defected because he feared he would be jailed as punishment for
failing. Kim said he was afraid his family would be punished
because he defected.
   On April 25, when he arrived in an unidentified European nation
from Moscow via Berlin, Kim said he telephoned the local South
Korean Embassy and asked to defect. He arrived in Seoul May 1.
   Kim said the $2 million he was ordered to raise was to be used
to construct a commercial center in preparation for the 13th World
Youth Festival scheduled for September 1989 in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital.
   He said the north, faced with a drastic shortage of hard
currency, was frantic about earning dollars to help finance various
development projects, particularly to modernize its economy.
   Kim also said the father of a self-confessed North Korean woman
agent involved in the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner
was recalled from a diplomatic assignment in Angola.
   The woman, Kim Hyon Hui, who was captured and brought to Seoul
after the plane was lost with all 115 people aboard, confessed in a
news conference that the plane was destroyed to disrupt the Olympic
Games, scheduled to begin in Seoul in September. North Korea is
demanding to co-host the Games.
   Kim said the recall made him think the bombing was the work of
the north, although it has denied any involvement in the incident.
   Kim denied he defected because he had been offered money to do
so. The Seoul government traditionally awards large sums to
defectors from the communist north.

<HEAD>Court Grants Police Pension to Former `Leave It To Beaver' Actor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth C. Osmond, who played wiseguy Eddie
Haskell on the ``Leave It to Beaver'' TV series, was granted a
police department disability pension by a state court.
   Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin on Tuesday ordered the Board of
Pension Commissioners to reverse itself and grant the 46-year-old
Osmond a service-connecteddisability pension retroactive to his
last day of service.
   Osmond played the Beaver's nemesis on the show from 1957 to
1963. He reprised Eddie for a CBS movie in 1983 and for a revival
of the series on the Disney Channel before doing ``The New Leave It
to Beaver,'' which is relayed by Atlanta superstation WTBS to more
than 10,000 cable systems.
   The former motorcycle officer contended that he suffered deep
depression after being shot three times by a suspect he was
pursuing in September 1980. His bulletproof vest stopped two slugs
and a third ricocheted off his belt buckle.
   ``All of the psychiatrists agree that (Osmond's) condition is a
real and disabling psychiatric condition,'' Lewin said in his
ruling. ``Nowhere in the administrative record is it suggested that
(he) has feigned his symptoms.'' The board had ruled Osmond was not
disabled.
   Osmond contended his condition improved when he was released
from duty between September 1981 and March 1982, but that it
worsened when he went back to work. He said he began drinking
excessively to relieve the stress.
   Lewin said he believed that if Osmond returned even to light
duty, he would have another relapse.
   Deputy City Attorney Eudon Ferrell argued the board's finding
was correct. He said Osmond had expressed disenchantment with the
criminal justice system, the police department and law enforcement
in general.

   Michael Dukakis, who clinched the delegates he
needed to lock in the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday
night, proclaimed: ``Tomorrow, the race to the finish line begins.''
   Victories in the four final primaries of the season gave the
Massachusetts governor a mathematical lock on more than the 2,081
delegates he needs to ensure his nomination at the party's
convention next month.
   Dukakis won races in California, New Jersey, Montana and New
Mexico.
   ``My friends, California has put us over the top,'' Dukakis told
a late-night victory rally in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis told supporters, though, that ``someone is missing'' _
his wife Kitty, who is in a Boston hospital following spinal surgery
last week. His comment echoed that of his wife earlier in the
evening.
   ``I wish I was somewhere else,'' Mrs. Dukakis said from her
hospital bed.
   Looking ahead to the confrontation with Vice President George
Bush, the certain Republican nominee, Dukakis said he hoped to avoid
a negative campaign.
   ``Every day between now and November, the American people will
want to hear how we intend to build a strong and vibrant future for
our country,'' he said. ``They aren't interested in slashing
attacks.''
   Underscoring the point, he warned the Republicans not to engage
in ``mudslinging and name-calling.''
   ``The American people are not interested in what Mr. Bush thinks
of me or what I think of him,'' he said.
   In his speech, the Democratic nominee-to-be paid tribute to his
most durable Democratic competitor, Jesse Jackson.
   ``I know I speak with pride for every American when I speak about
this race: a son of immigrants from Massachusetts and a black man
who grew up poor in South Carolina are the two finalists for the
Democratic nomination for the presidency of the United States,'' he
said.
   Dukakis, who has been engaged in delicate maneuverings aimed at
keeping Jackson's constituency without agreeing to all of his
rival's demands, said earlier Tuesday that he agreed with Jackson
that it was up to the nominee to choose his running mate.
   Jackson, however, was saying that an offer of the No. 2 spot to
him was ``an option my constituency has earned.''
   ``We may have a floor fight or two'' at the convention next
month, Dukakis said. ``There may be some issues that go to the
floor. I don't see any great divisions within our party. We're going
to have ourselves a great convention.''
   Dukakis and Jackson held a private, 90-minute meeting that broke
up in the early morning hours Tuesday.
   Dukakis said they had not discussed the No. 2 spot on the ticket
_ a position Jackson gave increasing signals that he had an interest
in. Dukakis said the two ``talked in general terms'' about a Jackson
role in a Dukakis administration, but he declined to elaborate.
   Jackson told reporters separately they discussed South Africa,
party rules and convention delegates.
   Dukakis contended he had no differences with Jackson on South
Africa, the issue Jackson has cited as one he may take to the
convention floor in Atlanta. But at the same time Dukakis refused to
meet Jackson's insistence that he agree to label South Africa a
terrorist nation.
   ``I don't see the importance of labels here,'' Dukakis said.
   He repeated his support for a bill applying tougher sanctions
against the racially separated nation, and he blasted ``naked
military aggression by South Africa against its neighbors.''
   ``I don't see any great divisions on this or any other issue,''
Dukakis said.
   Dukakis and Bush met briefly between appearances before the TV
group and discussed what Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said were
``general pleasantries.''
   Dukakis planned to return to Massachusetts early Wednesday. He
planned a stop in St. Louis on the way, where defeated Democratic
presidential rival Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., planned to endorse
his candidacy. Another former candidate, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
planned to offer his support in Washington.

<HEAD>New Government Offers Compromise On Nuclear Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has resolved a crisis
in its relationship with NATO by ruling that alliance warships will
be allowed to visit Denmark without revealing if they're carrying
nuclear weapons.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said Tuesday that his government
will notify the diplomatic missions of its NATO allies of Denmark's
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons. Visiting vessels, however, will
receive no such notice.
   A dispute over toughening Denmark's longstanding nuclear weapons
ban triggered an unscheduled election May 10 that ended in a
political stalemate and Schlueter returned as prime minister in a
minority coalition last week.
   Before the elections, the socialist opposition pushed a
resolution through the Folketing, or parliament, that obliged the
government to remind visiting warships of Denmark's nuclear policy.
   Although the resolution of April 14 stands, the new center-right
government will send a note to the diplomatic missions of NATO
countries concerned rather than to each naval vessel, Schlueter
said.
   There is no mention of nuclear weapons in the note.
   But the sentence, ``The visit of the vessel is on condition that
it takes place according regulations set down by the Danish
government,'' will be inserted in the Foreign Ministry's standard
notice.
   Since 1976, Denmark has required all foreign warships wishing to
pass through its waters or dock at its ports to seek permission via
diplomatic channels.
   ``It is the government's view that this procedure repects our
allies' policy of neither to confirm nor to deny the presence of
nuclear weapons on board their naval vessels,'' Schlueter said.
   ``The government has been in touch with allied governments which
share this view,'' he added.
   The United States and Britain, two nuclear powers whose warships
make frequent visits in Danish ports, had objected strongly to the
resolution.
   Its implementation by means of a letter to naval captains could
have prevented allied ships from participating in NATO sea
exercises in Danish waters and undermine the alliance's nuclear
deterrence strategy, they said.
   The new cabinet, the third non-socialist administration headed
by Schlueter since 1982, was announced last Friday.
   Svend Auken, leader of the main opposition Social Democratic
party that sponsored the resolution, called the government's move
``a weak signal to the outside world about Denmark's nuclear
policy.''

<TEXT>
   The former foreign minister of Fiji was
released from police custody today two days after he was arrested
for allegedly smuggling arms from the Middle East.
   Krishna Datt, a Fiji Indian, was one of about 50 people rounded
up this week following seizures of Soviet-made AK47 rifles, rocket
launchers and grenades believed shipped into the country in April
from North Yemen.
   Datt was Fiji's foreign minister in an Indian-dominated
coalition goverment. A coup led by ethnic Fijians ousted the
coalition government 13 months ago.
   Authorities meanwhile said a brother-in-law of interim Prime
Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was among 15 people charged with
conspiring to illegally import the weapons.
   Ratu Mosese Tuisawau, 67, half brother of Mara's wife, Adi Lady
Lala Mara, is also the only ethnic Fijian charged in the gun
running case.
   The group was refused bail Tuesday in Lautoka Magistrate's
Court, pending a June 20 court appearance.
   Tuisawau, a senior chief in Fiji's traditional tribal hierachy,
is a known supporter of Timoci Bavadra, whose Indian-dominated
government was overthrown in the May 14, 1987 coup.
   Datt, foreign minister in the Bavadra government, said today
that police interrogations had been difficult.
   ``It is clear they were trying to implicate me (in the gun
running),'' he told reporters.
   Security forces found caches of buried arms on Monday and
Tuesday. The seizures came one week after customs officers in
Australia intercepted a huge arms shipment also bound for Fiji.
   Australian officials said there were enough arms to start a
small war.
   Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka has claimed the arms shipments were
part of a foreign plot to destabilize the nation. But he has not
specifically accused any country, group or organization.
   Rabuka staged two coups last year, claiming he was protecting
the political rights of ethnic Fijians, who are outnumbered by
Indians in the 715,000 population.
   Rabuka has since handed power to an interim government headed by
Mara while a new constitution is drafted that will guarantee Fijian
dominance in a future parliament.
   He remains head of the army and appointed himself minister for
home affairs in charge of national security.

   One of the most vocal critics of House Speaker
Jim Wright's ethics has acknowledged that, like Wright, he once had
a congressional aide work on a book published under his name.
   But Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Tuesday that the work his
aide did on his book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' before its
publication in 1984 was much different from the work Wright's aide
did on the speaker's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Gingrich, who asked the House ethics committee last month to
investigate Wright's personal financial dealings, said he's
``fairly confident'' he asked Frank Gregorsky, his administrative
assistant in 1984, to review the manuscript of his book because
``he's a first class writer.''
   ``That is totally appropriate and to the extent that (a staff
member) filled that role, it would not be inappropriate,'' Gingrich
said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Matthew Cossolotto, a former aide to Wright, said in interviews
this week that he spent 150 to 200 hours while on Wright's
congressional staff working on the speaker's book.
   House records show that Cossolotto also was paid $2,078 from
official congressional accounts to cover his expenses during a 1984
trip to Texas when he oversaw the final editing of the book.
   Wright has refused to comment on the matter since Sunday, when
he defended Cossolotto's assignment during a telephone interview
with the Washington Post. He canceled his regular daily news
briefing Tuesday and denied an Associated Press request for an
interview on the subject.
   Gingrich's request for a House ethics committee investigation of
Wright came several weeks before Cossolotto's role in the
production of Wright's book became known publicly.
   But Gingrich said Tuesday he thinks the ethics panel also should
examine whether Wright violated House rules by assigning Cossolotto
to work on the book.
   ``The idea of using 200 hours, of having it be your only job
assignment, of charging over $2,000 for a trip which a staffer says
was only for the purpose of going to Fort Worth in order to write
the book, it seems to me that's clearly wrong,'' he said.
   Gingrich said Gregorsky's only role in his own book was
reviewing the manuscript before it was published. He said he wrote
the first draft himself and the final draft was done with help from
his wife and a professional writer who was paid by the publisher.
   Because of questions about such use of congressional staffers,
Gingrich said he is preparing a letter to his colleagues suggesting
the creation of a bipartisan panel of retired congressmen to
re-examine the basic ethics rules of the House.
   In a related development, The Washington Times reported today
that Wright transferred $97,700 in contributions to his 1976
campaign to repay personal debts but failed to report it in annual
House financial disclosure statements.
   Federal Election regulations allowed such transfers, which took
place in 1976 and 1977, but House ethics rules required that they
be disclosed as personal income, the newspaper said.
   The House ethics committee meets Thursday for a second session
to consider Gingrich's complaint against Wright. The panel met
behind closed doors for several hours last week without reaching
any decision on whether to launch an investigation.
   Part of Gingrich's complaint asked the ethics committee to
investigate reports that Wright receives unusually high royalties
of 55 percent for his book, which was published by a company that
was paid more than $250,000 for services to Wright's re-election
campaign in 1985-86.
   Carlos Moore, whose company published the book, said Tuesday the
20,000 press run has been sold out, with most copies being sold
directly by his company for $5.95 each. He said Wright received
$3.25 on each book and the company $2.70.
   Some copies of the book, however, were sold to bookstores for
$3, Moore said, and Wright received only $1 per book royalties on
those.
   In the interview with the Washington Post, Wright had responded
to reports that lobbyists had purchased multiple copies of the book
by saying he would be glad to have Moore provide a list of the
purchasers.
   But Moore said no such list was available, although he
speculated that ``very few'' were sold o bookstores.
   ``If I had to guess how many we sold to bookstores, I'd say
between 2,000 and 3,000,'' he said. ``Why take in $3 when I can
take in $5.95?''

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS JOHN HANCOCK IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy
has yet to test its expanded policy of defending non-U.S. flag
vessels in the Persian Gulf more than a month after it went ito
effect.
   But the prospect of facing that test is not lost on the officers
and men of ships like the John Hancock as they arrive to take up
the Navy's main mission of escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
plying the gulf.
   The John Hancock was beginning its first such assignment on
Tuesday, charged with shepherding the Gas Princess, a 46,723-ton
liquefied petroleum gas carrier, down the gulf and out through the
Strait of Hormuz.
   Cmdr. Robert B. O'Donnell, skipper of the John Hancock, said
that when the destoyer passed through the so-called Silkworm
envelope to enter the gulf for the first time Saturday, ``our
adrenalin level went up.''
   But he said that his crew of 330 felt they were well prepared
and ``ready for any eventuality that we might face here in the
Persian Gulf.''
   The convoy was the 34th of this year and the 56th since the
Reagan administration agreed last year to re-register 11 of
Kuwait's state-owned oil tankers under the Stars and Stripes and
provide them with protection from attack in the gulf, where Iran
and Iraq have been at war for nearly eight years.
   The John Hancock, a destroyer based in Mayport, Fla., is one of
five warships that arrived in the gulf in the past few days as part
of regular rotation.
   In an interview with members of a Pentagon news media pool on
the John Hancock's bridge, O'Donnell described its mission as not
only protecting vessels under the U.S. flag but serving as a symbol
of the American presence.
   ``We're here to let the petty tyrants and despots of the world
know that they shouldn't fool with the United States of America,
and specifically the United States Navy.''
   But he steered away from discussion of the recent expansion of
the U.S. rules of engagement that permit American commanders to go
to the aid of non-U.S. flag ships that are under attack and appeal
for assistance.
   Since the change went into effect May 3, Iranian gunboats have
carried out four known attacks on neutral merchant vessels in the
southern gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf. But
all were too far away for patrolling U.S. warships to intervene.
   In the nearest thing to a direct U.S.-Iran ecnounter, the
Aegis-type missile cruiser Vincennes found itself in the role of a
curious and frustrated observer last Thursday when an Iranian
frigate stopped, boarded and then escorted away a Cypriot flag
freighter apparently suspected of carrying war-connected cargo.
   U.S. Navy sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Vincennes received no distress appeal from the freighter but
followed the two vessels for some time as they headed toward the
Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.
   One source said the Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers III
``wanted to help him real bad.''
   ``They were doing everything that they could to give that guy an
opportunity,'' said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``They were even looking for signal lights for something.''
   But he said the Vincennes heard and saw nothing that would
indicate the master of the 10,000-ton Vevey wanted the American
ship to come to his aid.
   Greek owners of the Vevey said the ship, whose cargo was listed
as marble chips from Italy, was released by the Iranians a day
after it was detained and continued on its voyage to Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.

   Charley Pride set up a gazebo. Loretta
Lynn boasted a hot-pink booth with revolving mannequins. Barbara
Mandrell, surrounded by red, white and blue, offered up baseball and
apple pie.
   To hear country music stars tell it, Nashville's annual ``Fan
Fair'' is as important to them as it is to the thousands who make
the pilgrimage year after year to collect their autographs or
exchange a few words with their idols.
   ``People think that it's a drag for performers to meet fans
live,'' said singer K.T. Oslin, who won a Grammy this year as
country female vocalist for her single, ``80s Ladies.''
   ``It isn't. It's great fun,'' she said Tuesday. ``I mean that's
the only way you can tell what your work is going to when somebody
looks you in the face and they say, `I love your record and I'm from
so-and-so.' And you go, `All right, they hear me there.' The fans
are fun.''
   More than 20,000 country music lovers are expected to descend on
the state fairgrounds this week for seven days of festivities that
feature about 30 hours of concerts and 365 autograph booths.
   Naomi Judd, the older half of mother-daughter singing duo The
Judds, said she owes it to the fans to come to the festival.
   ``You come to see us when we come to your hometown. You guys go
buy the tickets, get babysitters, get your outfits ready and hassle
the traffic and come to see us,'' she said. ``I think the least we
can do when you come to our hometown is to show up.''
   Pride manned a gazebo to greet his fans. Miss Lynn's booth was
painted hot pink and had revolving mannequins displaying T-shirts.
Miss Mandrell used a red, white and blue baseball motif for her
booth and offered apple pie to her fans.
   The fair gives the performers a chance to pay back their fans,
said singer Eddy Raven.
   ``Anybody who tells you that they come out here just because they
love to come _ in the heat and all that _ that's wrong. It's not
true,'' he said. ``It's a time that we can really come and meet
folks and not be under the pressure of having to perform.''
   The festival, in its 17th year, also gives the entertainers an
opportunity to sell merchandise.
   T.G. Sheppard photo magnets were going for $1. A Ricky Scaggs
T-shirt cost $13. Tanya Tucker caps were selling for $8 and the Oak
Ridge Boys had sweatshirts for $20.
   Connie Mays of Dayton, Ohio, said she has come to Fan Fair for
the past seven or eight years.
   ``You look forward to it. As soon as you're going home, you think
about, `Gee, I can't wait until next year,''' she said. ``You take
pictures of the same people every year, but you just still like it.''
   Lisa Huggett of Battle Creek, Mich., said she got married in
April, but postponed her honeymoon to attend Fan Fair, which is
sponsored by the Country Music Association and the Grand Ole Opry.
   ``I love country music,'' she said. ``That's all we listen to.''

   Montana's Republicans on Tuesday chose
Conrad Burns, a county commissioner from Billings, to challenge
Democratic Sen. John Melcher, who smothered an obscure challenge in
his party's primary.
   Former Gov. Thomas Judge won the Democratic primary to vie for
the succession of retiring two-term Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden,
and former state Sen. Stan Stephens won the GOP's gubernatorial
primary to oppose him.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
easily outdistanced Jesse Jackson in the Democratic contest for
Montana's 19 delegates, while Vice President George Bush walked away
in GOP voting.
   Melcher, 64, seeking a third Senate term, put down an
underfinanced and barely visible challenge from Robert Kelleher, a
Billings lawyer.
   Burns beat Thomas Faranda, a Minnesotan who filed for the GOP
nomination but gave up his absentee bid weeks ago, though his name
remained on the ballot.
   Melcher said the difference between him and Burns was experience.
``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' he said.
``He's going to try and say that's a disadvantage, but I don't
really think it is.
   ``The longer you're here, the more chances you have to get bills
passed ... that will benefit Montana,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his suburban outside Washington, D.C.
   With 641 of 982 precincts, or 65 percent, reporting, Melcher had
55,011 votes or 74.7 percent compared to 18,609 or 25.3 percent for
Kelleher; Burns had 38,026 votes or 84.0 percent to 7,270 votes or
16.0 percent for Faranda.
   In the Democrats' six-candidate governor's primary, with 626
precincts reporting, or 64 percent, Judge won with 27,251 votes, or
39.5 percent; former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison had 18,806
votes or 27.2 percent and Attorney General Mike Greeley had 15,607
votes or 22.6 percent.
   The other three candidates combined for nearly 11 percent of the
vote.
   In the Republican gubernatorial primary, former state Sen. Stan
Stephens won with 25,674 votes, or 48.9 percent to state Rep. Cal
Winslow's 23,168 votes, or 44.2 percent.
   Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination were State
Sen. Ted Neuman, Emmett ``Curly'' Thornton, an ex-drug addict turned
evangelist, and Martin ``Red'' Beckman, a tax protester.

   With Montana's economy in the doldrums, the campaign for governor
revolved around varying plans for reviving it. Central issues were
whether to enact a retail sales tax _ Montana has none _ and whether
to tap a multimillion-dollar trust fund built from coal severance
taxes during the boom years of energy exploration.
   Judge, who was governor during some of those boom years before
Schwinden beat him in the 1980 primary, harkened back to those days
in urging voters to return him to the statehouse. But his rivals
said the prosperity of those years had nothing to do with Judge.
   The keystone of Morrison's campaign was his pledge to veto any
sales tax, whatever its purpose or design.
   Winslow proposed a 3 percent sales tax as a replacement for
property taxes he said were too high.
   Republicans have not won the governorship in 20 years.

<HEAD>After 14 Years, Grant Gets A Chance To Be State's First Black
Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Councilman Donald Payne has wanted to be
New Jersey's first black congressman for the past 14 years, but
always faced a major obstacle: Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J.
   Rodino, who turned 79 on Tuesday, was first elected in 1948 to
represent the 10th District and was re-elected to 20 consecutive
terms, even after the district got a black majority in 1972.
   This year, Rodino announced his retirement, under increasing
pressure to let the district be represented by the state's first
black congressman.
   That gave Payne, 53, his first serious chance at Congress since
1974, when he declared his candidacy for a proposed new district
that never was created.
   ``I feel like I have earned the right to represent this district.
I have earned the right to succeed Peter Rodino,'' said Payne, vice
president of a computer forms company.
   Tuesday night, Payne handily defeated his Democratic opponent,
fellow councilman Ralph T. Grant, Jr. to win the nomination, which
is tantamount to a general election in the heavily Democratic
district.
   ``It gives our delegation the fairness its been lacking for many
years. I can speak from a true urban perspective,'' Payne said.
   Payne, softspoken, often shy in crowds and uncomfortable in front
of the camera, began his public service career working with the
YMCA. He became the national organization's first black president in
1970.
   In 1972, he was elected to the Essex County Board of Chosen
Freeolders _ roughy equivalent to a county commissioner, and served
for six years.
   Payne announced in 1974 that he would be a candidate for Congress
should a redistricting open up a new district. The plan fell through
in the Legislature and Payne turned to Newark city politics.
   In the 1986 primary, Payne contended that it was time a minority
candidate represented the largely inner-city district. Payne's
campaign was boosted by a number of personal appearances by Jesse
Jackson.
   Rodino captured about 60 percent of the vote, but felt enough
pressure to during the primary to hint that his 20th term would be
his last.

   A black woman who faces arrest for refusing to
testify about her daughter's alleged abduction and rape by six
whites will take sanctuary in a church to seek ``relief from a
higher authority,'' one of her lawyers says.
   But authorities have issued a statewide warrant for Glenda
Brawley and said she's ``fair game'' for arrest.
   On Monday, the 33-year-old Mrs. Brawley was sentenced to 30 days
in jail for defying a grand jury subpoena to testify. But upon the
urging of state Attorney General Robert Abrams, she was given one
more chance: an opportunity to tell a judge today why she had
refused to cooperate.
   However, attorney Alton Maddox Jr., who has claimed state
officials are involved in a racially motivated cover-up, said Mrs.
Brawley would take sanctuary in a black church rather than appear
before a grand jury in Poughkeepsie this morning.
   ``The history of this nation will be on trial tomorrow and I dare
Robert Abrams or (Gov.) Mario Cuomo to come into the black church,''
Maddox said at a news conference Tuesday.
   ``Glenda Brawley will be seeking relief before a higher
authority, she will be putting her life in God's hands.''
   ``You don't mess with black people in their churches,'' said Mrs.
Brawley's sister Juanita.
   Neither Maddox nor other Brawley family advisers participating in
the news conference _ attorney C. Vernon Mason and the Rev. Al
Sharpton _ would say what church would offer Mrs. Brawley asylum,
though Sharpton said it was in New York City. They insisted
authorities had no right to enter a church to arrest her.
   Maddox said there was ``a longstanding precedent that persons who
have been oppressed politically can seek asylum in a church.''
   But Sgt. John Clifford, a New York City Police Department
spokesman, said the decision to arrest people who request sanctuary
privileges is decided on a case-by-case basis.
   Police are allowed to arrest suspects who run into a church, the
spokesman said. However, if the suspect requests refuge and is
granted sanctuary by the pastor, police must obtain a search warrant
to make an arrest or negotiate with the parties involved, Clifford
said.
   Tim Gilles, a spokesman for Abrams, said Tuesday night that ``due
to the confrontational nature'' of developments during the day,
Abrams told the Dutchess County sheriff's office he no longer had
objections to arresting Mrs. Brawley immediately.
   ``She's fair game,'' said Sheriff's Capt. Dennis O'Keeffe, whose
office filed a statewide warrant for her arrest Tuesday.
   Abrams, who is directing the grand jury investigation at the
governor's request, had said earlier he would not press for an
arrest until at least this afternoon.
   At the news conference, Mason reiterated the theme of the
Brawleys and their advisers, saying ``It is clear we cannot get
justice for Tawana Brawley.''
   He said authorities had ``done everything possible to blame the
victim even more. How ludicrous it is for the nation to see that the
only person arrested in this case is the mother of a black rape
victim. People should be outraged.''
   Tawana Brawley was found Nov. 28, four days after she had
disappeared.
   The 16-year-old high school student was lying dazed in a plastic
bag in a road in Wappingers Falls, about 10 miles south of
Poughkeepsie. Her hair had been shorn, animal excrement had been
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her
torso.
   She said she'd been attacked by six white men, and alleged that
one flashed a police-like badge.
   Neither she nor her family has cooperated with investigators or
made public more details. Her mother was not in the Dutchess County
courtroom Monday when state Judge Angelo Ingrassia sentenced her to
jail and fined her $250.

   The leftist Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels moved closer to a settlement as they began
another round of peace talks. Both sides reported progress on the
key issue of democratic reforms.
   Negotiators, who meet again today, discussed on Tuesday a
government proposal that a Sandinista official said accedes to
nearly all Contra rebel demands for ending the ruling party's
political monopoly.
   Before they lay down their arms and end six years of fighting,
the rebels want guaranteed freedom of the press, an end to
Sandinista control of the army and government, the right to strike
and judicial and electoral reforms.
   ``We have made substantial advances,'' Information Minister
Manuel Espinoza said after Tuesday's session in Managua that opened
the fourth round of negotiations since the foes signed a preliminary
peace accord on March 23.
   Bosco Mamatoros, spokesman for the rebels, said ``there were
advances in the discussion on themes of a substantial character,''
but added that political reform remains ``the biggest problem in the
discussions.''
   A government representative who spoke on condition of anonymity
said earlier that the Sandinistas had agreed to nearly all rebel
demands for political reform.
   The Sandinista proposal was also said to offer the Contras a role
in talks begun late last year between the government and domestic
opposition parties.
   An American negotiator for the government said Tuesday that the
two main obstacles to a definitive settlement were the fine print of
disarmament and amnesty for jailed Contras.
   Paul Reichler, a Washington-based attorney, said the Sandinistas
want full disarmament and reintegration of the Contras into civilian
life by the end of September. He said the rebels had proposed laying
down their weapons by the end of January.
   Reichler said the rebel proposal was linked to the U.S.
presidential elections in November and January inauguration of a new
president ``to preserve a military option.''
   He called it ``one last roll of the dice on a (George) Bush
victory.'' The vice president is the likely Republican nominee.
   But the Sandinista proposal also may be linked to the U.S.
elections.
   A cease-fire in hand by November would favor the Democrats, a
majority of whom have opposed continued U.S. military assistance for
the rebels. It also would represent an embarrassment for the
Republican administration.
   The Democratic majority in Congress rejected President Reagan's
last request for additional military aid to the rebels, which ended
Feb. 26. Congress last approved a military aid package for the
Contras in June 1986 that totalled $100 million.
   Reichler said the Contras also wanted to change the amnesty plan
agreed to by both sides in March. That plan calls on the government
to release half of jailed rebels after Contra combatants move into
truce zones and the remainder at a still undetermined date.
   He said the Contras are calling for the release of all prisoners
five days after the rebels move into the truce areas.
   The talks are taking place amid a temporary truce enacted March
21. The rebels have extended the truce until Thursday and the
government has declared a unilateral cease-fire until the end of
June.
   Each side accuses the other of violations.
   Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday near Juigalpa, capital of
central Chontales state. A Sandinista soldier who asked not to be
identified told The Associated Press the fighting involved at least
70 Contras and 50 army troops.
   Two Contras were captured, and an undetermined number of
government troops were wounded and taken by helicopter to a hospital
in Juigalpa, he said.

   Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy trounced three political
unknowns in the Democratic Senate primary Tuesday to win the right
to face Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, whose seat has ``jinxed''
incumbents for 30 years.
   California voters also rejected a proposition that potentially
could have quarantined AIDS victims, and early returns Tuesday
showed voters opposing the relaxation of government spending limits
and favoring a $1 billion transportation bond.
   With 4,267 of 23,606 precincts reporting, 18 percent of the
total, McCarthy had 433,135 votes or 83 percent against his
little-known opponents. John Hancock Abbott of Santa Clara gathered
38,651 votes or 7 percent, Robert Banuelos of Orange had 25,084
votes or 5 percent and Charles Greene of Los Angeles had 25,272
votes or 5 percent.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
swept to an easy victory over Jesse Jackson, netting the fraction of
the state's Democratic delegates needed to clinch his party's
nomination, while Vice President George Bush won the state's
Republican primary, where 175 delegates were being awarded.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor won election to a full four-year
term by gaining a majority of the vote in a nonpartisan primary in
the nation's seventh-largest city.
   With 8 percent of precincts reporting, she had 15,145 votes or
57.3 percent and her nearest rival, former City Councilman Floyd
Morrow, had 9,242 votes or 35 percent.
   Among ballot measures, with about 21 percent of precincts
reporting, voters were opposing Proposition 71 by 53 percent to 47
percent. The measure would ease the spending limits Californians
placed on their state government in a 1979 voter initiative,
permitting an estimated $700 million annual increase in state
spending and reducing by an equal amount the funds likely to be
earmarked for future tax rebates.
   Proposition 72, which would also change the spending limit but
with almost exactly the opposite effect, was trailing 61 percent to
39 percent in early returns. It would reduce the limit for most
state programs by an estimated $725 million annually by earmarking
those funds exclusively for highways.
   With 21 percent of the vote counted, the tally against a proposal
backed by extremist Lyndon LaRouche to declare AIDS a communicable
disease, subjecting victims to potential quarantine, was soundly
rejected by 747,702 votes or 67 percent to 369,934 percent or 33
percent.
   Meanwhile, a $1 billion bond measure sponsored by Gov. George
Deukmejian to fund highway construction and improvement, part of a
record-breaking $3.2 billion in bonds, was being narrowly favored 51
percent to 49 percent.
   In Sacramento County, with 20 percent of the total tallied, a
measure seeking closure of the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant
trailed by 29,238 votes or 49 percent to 31,087 votes or 52 percent.
It could mark the first time in history that voters directly ordered
closure of a nuclear plant.
   A proposal to carve out a new Mojave County from the eastern,
desert portions of San Bernardino County, the nation's largest, was
trailing by nearly 2-1 in returns from absentee voters. Other issues
included competing proposals to limit campaign spending.
   Voters in seven Southern California communities were being asked
to adopt initiatives designed to slow growth or make developers pay
for it. In northern and western Los Angeles County, Supervisor Mike
Antonovich was challenged by candidates who said he has allowed
developers to make their lives miserable.
   Antonovich got just 50.4 percent of the absentee vote in a field
of 10 candidates. If he fails to win more than 50 percent of the
vote in the non-partisan contest, he would be forced into a fall
runoff with the other top vote-getter.
   The one congressional incumbent with a serious primary challenge
was freshman Republican Ernest Konnyu, an outspoken conservative
from the San Jose suburb of Saratoga. With 52 percent of the vote
counted, he was trailing Stanford University Professor Tom Campbell,
a moderate, by 2,188 votes to 2,820.
   Campbell was supported by Konnyu's two Republican predecessors,
former Reps. Pete McCloskey and Ed Zschau.
   In two heavily Republican Los Angeles-area congressional
districts, two former White House aides were leading in races for
GOP nominations to replace retiring incumbents. Both of their
campaigns had featured appearences by indicted former White House
national security aide Oliver North.
   With some absentee ballots counted, Christopher Cox of Santa Ana
was building a substantal lead, collecting 2,278 votes to 1,419 for
his closest competition, David Baker, in the 13-candidate 40th
District primary.
   The other former aide, Dana Rohrabacker of Los Angeles, was
leading eight Republicans with 1,829 votes to 1,505 for Harriet
Wieder.

   The AIDS proposition was opposed by the California Medical
Association and the leadership of both major parties. It was almost
identical to a measure sponsored by LaRouche's organization which
was defeated by a 2-1 margin by Californians in 1986.
   The two spending limit propositions were both indirectly linked
to the Proposition 13 tax cut initiative approved by voters 10 years
ago, as each sought to amend the spending limits imposed in a
followup initiative to 13.
   Twenty-six local tax measures were also linked to Proposition 13,
which required voter approval for any tax increase above the
ceilings it set in 1978. Eleven counties were asking voters to
approve sales tax hikes for libraries, highways, jails or other
local programs, and 15 other jurisdictions sought additional
property or hotel taxes.
   In the Senate primary, both Wilson and McCarthy concentrated on
fund-raising and laying the groundwork for their November faceoff.
   Wilson's success at avoiding even token opposition was evidence
of how succcessfully the moderate former San Diego mayor has
neutralized his once-vocal critics from the conservative wing of the
GOP.
   Wilson has led McCarthy in fund-raising and the polls, but has to
contend with a political jinx _ no one has been re-elected to his
Senate seat in more than 30 years.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson congratulated Michael Dukakis
Tuesday night for clinching the Democratic presidential nomination
on the last night of their four-month primary duel, and repeated his
contention that he deserves ``serious consideration'' to be Dukakis'
running mate.
   ``I believe we have shown it is possible to compete without
conflict, differ without division,'' Jackson said in remarks
prepared for delivery to supporters gathered at a Los Angeles hotel.
He said he had built a ``mighty coalition'' and ``we have made
America better.
   Jackson pledged to go to the Democratic National Convention as
``the new Democratic majority _ to set the agenda for our nation and
our party.''
   Earlier, in an interview on ABC, he said: ``We'll have to work
together.''
   ``Michael Dukakis is due very special congratulations,'' Jackson
said in the interview, just after the Massachusetts governor scored
victories in the final races in California, New Jersey, Montana and
New Mexico.
   But Jackson noted that ``in a technical sense, the race is not
over'' until the Democratic National Convention next month. Dukakis
has now earned enough delegates to be assured of a first-ballot
victory there.
   Earlier Tuesday, as voters were going to the polls, Jackson
pledged to keep campaigning for delegates until the Democratic
National Convention.
   Dukakis claimed enough delegates to sew up the presidential
nomination in the final primaries on Tuesday. But Jackson told
reporters he had no intention of throwing in the towel, arguing that
many delegates will still be uncommitted until the convention in
mid-July.
   He said at one point that his supporters deserve the option of
having him on the ticket, a contention that seemed to go beyond his
previous statements that he merely deserves consideration for the
vice presidential spot if he doesn't win the presidential nomination.
   But under questioning later, he declined to pursue that, saying
it would be up to the convention to determine the nominee and his
running mate.
   The presidential nominee, he said, ``recommends'' to the
convention, which then selects his running mate.
   ``Suffice it to say, we're going to keep our campaign alive to
July, at the convention,'' he said. ``(Ted) Kennedy did it in 1980,
(Gary) Hart did it in 1984, I will do it in 1988.''
   He said he will be contacting at-large delegates and ``super
delegates,'' trying to persuade them to support him instead of
Dukakis.
   ``The commitments made by at-large and super delegates are
non-binding until convention time, and so it's appropriate to make
appeals to delegates based upon friendship, based upon constituent
considerations,'' he said.
   Jackson spent election day in California speaking to an ABC
convention and to two rallies in the Los Angeles area.
   He said he and Dukakis did not discuss the vice presidency or any
adminstration role for Jackson in their late-night meeting on Monday.
   He called it a ``good meeting, an effective meeting,'' covering a
wide range of issues including South Africa, the Soviet Union, the
party platform and universal voter registration.
   Jackson, who has repeatedly said Dukakis is too conservative and
cautious, said he will keep the pressure on the front-runner in
future meetings to espouse more progressive positions.
   ``It's all right for him to be conservative because that's the
way he feels; it's his basic approach. But balance would be in the
progressive dirction,'' Jackson said.
   He said he wants to keep ``an open dialogue'' with Dukakis.
   Earlier, in a panel interview before a meeting of ABC affiliates,
Jackson said it would be Dukakis' option whether to offer him a spot
on the ticket, if Dukakis wins the nomination.
   But he then added, ``It is an option my constituency has earned.''
   ``The constituency I represent has earned its place at the top
level of American politics,'' he said.
   In a reflective tone that he has adopted in the last days of the
primary campaign, Jackson also said he has achieved key objectives
of his presidential campaign.
   ``The three objectives of my campaign have in some measure been
addressed _ expand the party, build a viable converging interest
coalition and change national priorities,'' he said.
   ``To that extent we now have a tremendous sense of hope about the
country,'' which he said, ``is changing for the better.''

   Not every Dukakis was a winner in Tuesday's
New Jersey presidential primary: Academy Award-winning actress
Olympia Dukakis lost in her bid to be a delegate for her cousin
Michael at the Democratic National Convention.
   With 283 of the 286 precincts reporting in Ms. Dukakis' 18th
Delegate District in Essex County, Jesse Jackson had 26,222 votes to
22,175 votes for Michael Dukakis, according to unofficial returns.
   In the separate delegate election, the five delegate candidates
pledged to Jackson won, while Ms. Dukakis and the four other
candidates pledged to the Massachusetts governor lost.
   Robert Noonan, the husband of one of the district's Dukakis
delegates, Joanna Noonan, said the Dukakis delegate slate had
conceeded. ``Sure we're disappointed,'' he said.
   Brenda Neily, an official at Dukakis' campaign headquarters in
Boston, said Olympia's loss came as ``a disappointment, but not a
surprise.''
   The delegate district includes not only suburban, middle-class
Montclair, where Ms. Dukakis lives, but also inner-city areas in
Orange and East Orange.
   Michael Dukakis fared much better, winning the statewide primary
by a wide margin. With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, he had
65 percent of the vote to 31 percent for Jesse Jackson.
   Ms. Dukakis won the Academy Award this year for her role in the
movie ``Moonstruck'' and gave her cousin's campaign a plug when she
accepted the Oscar. ``OK, Michael, let's go!'' she yelled, waving
the statuette.
   In the weeks that followed, she made a number of campaign
appearances with the Massachusetts governor.
   Tuesday night, Ms. Dukakis was reported to be in Vancouver,
British Columbia, filming a movie, and could not be reached for
comment about the election results.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, saying
he's ready for the ``real battle,'' vowed to come out swinging in
his match with Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   The Massachusetts governor wrapped up his party's nomination
Tuesday night with returns from the final four primaries in
California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   For Bush, though, Tuesday's contests were just another round of
uncontested races _ he locked up the delegates he needed for the
Republican nomination back in April.
   The vice president, who was flying back to Washington overnight,
was meeting this morning with President Reagan. He planned to
resume campaigning on Thursday, with two days of appearances in his
adopted home state of Texas.
   At a victory rally here following runaway wins in the four
primaries, he said he was happy to see the primary season end.
   ``This is the beginning of the real battle,'' Bush declared.
``Now we'll be going into the major-league ballgame.''
   Now that Dukakis is the Democratic nominee in all but name, the
vice president said, contrasts between the two candidates will be
highlighted.
   ``That's the nice thing about getting the primary over with,''
he said in an interview on NBC-TV. ``I am ready on the issues.''
   Recent polls have suggested Bush trails Dukakis, but he brushed
the surveys aside.
   ``I'm fighting back, I'm the underdog now,'' he said in the NBC
interview.
   Bush underscored that point in another primary-night interview,
this one on CBS-TV.
   ``There's a perception problem perhaps on some of these early
polls,'' he said. ``But I've been pounded out there without the
benefit of having a horse race every Tuesday.''
   Bush has long complained that Dukakis has been getting a round
of favorable publicity every time he defeated Jesse Jackson in a
primary, while he was left out of the spotlight.
   ``The issues for the fall are not in focus,'' he said. ``The
differences between ourselves and Gov. Dukakis are going to be very
clear when the fall rolls around.''
   Earlier, the vice president said he would continue to move away
from the president where they differ because ``I have to spell out
my own identity'' in the fall presidential campaign.
   Bush has edged away from administration policy on issues from
offshore oil drilling to negotiations with Panama's Manuel Noriega.

<HEAD>Congress Passes Long-Awaited Land Reform Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress today passed a land reform
law supporters say will improve the lives of millions of
impoverished Filipinos. Critics say the plan could fail unless it is
implemented efficiently.
   President Corazon Aquino, who asked Congress to enact land reform
last July, was expected to sign the bill by Friday. Land reform was
a chief promise during her 1986 election campaign against ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The measure gives landowners the choice of dividing their
property among tenants or sharing profits with them. It is expected
to cost $70 billion and benefit 2 million farmers in this largely
agricultural nation of 7,100 islands. Land reform is also considered
essential to defeating the 19-year-old communist insurgency, which
has its main support in rural areas.
   ``We are very pleased with the final bill,'' said Rep. Ramon
Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives. ``It is a measure
that will change the lives of millions.''
   Under the plan, each landowner may retain 12 acres and an
additional seven acres for each direct heir over age 15 who will
till the land. A landowner also has the option of sharing profits or
giving tenants shares of stock instead of physically dividing the
property.
   All but one of the 19 senators present approved the bill late
Tuesday. Sen. Vicente Paterno, a landowner, abstained. The other
four members left before the vote. The 203-member House of
Representatives later passed the measure by a vote of 152-20 with
four abstentions.
   Sen. Heherson Alvarez, a former agrarian reform minister who
sponsored the legislation, said it would bring ``democratization of
the means of production.''
   Rep. Jose Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's younger brother, voted in
favor despite earlier objections to the plan.
   ``There are a few sections that have to be amended, but for the
first time this bill will really accomplish a genuine land reform,''
he said. The president's family owns a 14,820-acre sugar plantation
in Tarlac province north of Manila.
   Rep. Bonifacio Gillego sponsored the original House bill but
withdrew after changes began. He voted against the legislation today
and told his colleagues they were ``foisting a grand deception on
our people.''
   He said the plan would fail if the government does not provide
credit, expertise and other assistance to new landholders. He also
predicted communist rebels will oppose the plan.
   ``They will try to expose it as bogus and not genuine, not
equitable,'' Gillego told The Associated Press. ``Therefore, they
will engage in a vigorous campaign. So the burden is on the
government to show it is not bogus.''
   Gillego said farmers would oppose the profit-sharing option and
it might ``result in agrarian reform, if you will, through a
revolution.''
   Leftist farmers' groups have said the bill favors landowners.
   Guillermo Luz, executive director of the influential Makati
Business Club, said the government's skill in implementing the
program will determine its success or failure.
   ``The private sector will have to be involved, especially with
technical and management expertise and credit,'' he said. ``It will
have to devise a system of agricultural credits in the countryside.''
   The bill also provides for the transfer to farm workers of tracts
of public land greater than 2,470 acres now leased to multinational
corporations.
   Government lands will be the first distributed in the 10-year
program. Private holdings of more than 123 acres will be parceled
out in the first four years and smaller holdings later. Owners of
more than 123 acres will be compensated with 25 percent of the value
in cash and those with less than 60 acres will be paid 35 percent in
cash.
   Tax exemptions, shares of stock in government-owned or controlled
corporations or Land Bank of the Philippines bonds will make up the
rest of the compensation.
   Officials say the program will be financed by foreign aid and
assets of Marcos and his allies that were seized on grounds they
were illegally acquired.
   Marcos governed the Philippines for 20 years but was driven from
the country in February 1986 by a civilian-military uprising that
brought Mrs. Aquino to power.
   The Philippines has attempted about a dozen land reform programs
in this century, but they have largely failed due to lack of funds
and resistance from landowners.
   ``Genuine'' land reform was among the demands of pro-Soviet Huk
rebels in the 1950s and early 1960s and is a principal goal of
communist rebels who launched their current insurgency in 1968.

   Democrats easily swept aside five

primary elections.
   The strongest showing Tuesday by a LaRouche follower was Ronald
Kirk in Davenport, who finished with 5,635 votes to 12,966 for
Democrat Bill Gluba, who won his second chance to challenge
incumbent Republican Rep. Jim Leach.
   Iowa's senior congressman, 15-term 4th District Democratic Rep.
Neal Smith also faced a LaRouche follower, polling 12,733 votes to

   None of the state's four Republican congressmen had primary
opposition.

<TEXT>
   Independent religious activists are demanding that
the Russian Orthodox Church retract its past praise of Josef V.
Stalin and embrace the Soviet Union's new spirit of reforms.
   They are urging the church to follow the lead of other Soviet
organizations that are re-evaluating and condemning Stalin's
dictatorship.
   On Tuesday, nearly 100 religious dissidents from around the
Soviet Union packed a Moscow apartment for an unofficial three-day
seminar on religious problems in the Soviet Union.
   Father Gleb Yakunin told reporters the church is at a crossroads.
   ``It's the responsibility of the church to announce which side
it is on _ the side of perestroika or the side of Stalinism,'' he
said. ``A person cannot be renewed in his personal life unless he
repents. This is true of the church.''
   Perestroika, or restructuring, is what Mikhail S. Gorbachev
calls his ambitious program of social and economic reforms.
   Church activists released copies of an appeal they sent to
Patriarch Pimen, the Russian Orthodox Church leader, asking that
the church council condemn a 1949 letter it sent to Stalin for his
70th birthday, ``basically canonizing'' the dictator.
   The church told Stalin it was ``forever grateful to you for your
attentiveness to its needs.''
   So far, the church has kept silent on Stalin while many other
Soviets, including Gorbachev, have sharply criticized the
dictator's purges, which killed or exiled millions of people.
   After Stalin took power, a law was passed in 1929 sharply
restricting church activities. The church faced its severest
repression in the 1930s, when cathedrals were demolished and other
church property seized by the state.
   Yakunin and other religious activists met with reporters on the
second day of the Russian Orthodox Church local council in Zagorsk,
northeast of Moscow.
   The council is at the center of celebrations of Christianity's
arrival 1,000 years ago in Russia.
   Yakunin was barred from performing religious rites from 1966
until last year because of his criticism of church officials. He
also is a former political prisoner. In August, the church gave him
a small parish near Moscow.
   The dissidents criticized the selection of delegates for the
church council in Zagorsk and the amount of money being spent on
the millennium celebration.
   Ceremonies scheduled at Moscow's Bolshoi Theater threaten to
turn the event in a ``pompous, theatrical action,'' Yakunin said.
   Each day of the weeklong celebration costs about $1.6 million,
he said.

   Journalists are complaining that the
government is mishandling its investigations of the killings of
reporters, 25 of whom have been slain in Mexico in the past six
years.
   On Tuesday, a group of journalists boycotted a luncheon to mark
Mexico's ``Freedom of the Press Day.''
   President Miguel de la Madrid presented the National Journalism
Awards and attended the luncheon as his last official activity
before departing for New York, where he is to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
   Fernando Pineda, president of the liberal Union of Democratic
Journalists, said he did not attend the luncheon because ``on this
June 7, there is nothing to celebrate.''
   The union and other journalists' associations in Mexico complain
that the government has bungled investigations into the slayings of
the 25 journalists killed during the past six years.
   Most recently, columnist Hector Felix Miranda of the outspoken
weekly Zeta in the northwestern border city of Tijuana was fatally
shot April 20. Police believe the man arrested May 1 may have been
a triggerman acting for others.
   The Interior Department on Friday issued an unusually detailed
80-page report on the cases.
   The report says de la Madrid had ``put into practice the actions
needed to guarantee free exercise, without any restriction of the
freedom of the press'' throughout his six-year term, starting in
December 1982.
   De la Madrid told journalists on Tuesday that he ordered the
Interior Department to pursue its investigations into cases of
violence against Mexican reporters ``to better protect the life and
patrimony of journalists and the rights of the press.''
   The president's remarks were carried by the government news
agency Notimex.

   The dollar weakened in trading against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Wednesday, and stock prices also fell.
   After opening the day at 125.27 yen, the dollar edged up and
closed at 125.32 yen, 0.45 yen lower than its close Tuesday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 28.92-point loser Tuesday, dropped another 54.67
points, or 0.19 percent, to end the day's trading at 27,912.65.
   ``Profit-taking and a sense among investors that the market was
rising too high eased share prices a little,'' said Hiromi Yoneyama
of Wako Securities.
   But the market, being led mainly by capital-intensive steel
stocks, maintains its bullish trend with a strong buying mood among
all participants, including foreign, corporate and individual
investors, Yoneyama said.
   A foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo
said the dollar early weakness was a carryover from its performance
Tuesday in other currency markets.
   The early activity was said to be confined mostly to the Japanese
trading houses, dealers said.

   The name of former Gov. George C.
Wallace resurfaced in state politics as his son-in-law won a
Democratic primary nomination to a seat on the Alabama Supreme
Court.
   Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, 36, of Montgomery, the husband of
Wallace's daughter Peggy Sue, outpolled Anniston lawyer A.W. Bolt
on Tuesday for the Democratic nomination to the court.
   Kennedy is favored over GOP nominee Robert Maxwell.
   Wallace, who retired from politics in January 1987 after four
terms as governor, saw his son, George Jr., win the state
treasurer's post in 1986.
   A longtime Wallace ally, Associate Supreme Court Justice Henry
Steagall, also won a Democratic nomination to the high court. He
was Wallace's state finance director when the governor appointed
him to the bench in 1986.
   A third Wallace appointee, Associate Supreme Court Justice
Gorman Houston, lost a bid for chief justice to Tallassee lawyer
E.C. ``Sonny'' Hornsby in the Democratic primary.

   Jesse Jackson, the unvanquished loser, is
promising a post-primary workout for Michael Dukakis that could put
the Democratic nominee in prime condition for his general election
bout with George Bush.
   But Dukakis can't afford a messy convention or other major
missteps as the next six weeks test his mettle as a negotiator and a
leader.
   Dukakis has the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination firmly in
hand after four big victories on Tuesday's final round of 1988
primaries. Jackson can't shake Dukakis's grip on the nominating
majority at the Atlanta convention.
   But he has plenty of time to pressure Dukakis before and during
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July.
   The intensely determined Massachusetts governor expects some
fireworks from the fiery preacher _ indeed, he seems almost to be
welcoming them.
   ``We may have a contest or two ... We may have a floor fight or
two,'' Dukakis said in Los Angeles on Tuesday. ``There may be some
issues that go to the floor. I don't see any great divisions within
our party.''
   Jackson promised to take the South African issue to the
convention floor if the party platform does not measure up to his
standard of denouncing of that apartheid regime as terrorist.
   Dukakis almost invited the fight Tuesday night by saying that
``label is meaningless.''
   His attitude toward possible floor fights at the convention is a
healthy one, for two reasons.
   One, floor fights are not necessarily bad.
   A little drama and conflict makes good television in what could
otherwise be a very dull four days in July in Atlanta. But
out-of-control ideological spats have marred past Democratic
conventions, making many party professionals anxious to avoid them.
   Second, the more Dukakis refuses to give into pressure from the
left wing of the Democratic party on the issues, the better he is
positioned to ward off attacks from Republican George Bush.
   In a similar way, Jackson stepped up the pressure on the vice
presidential spot Tuesday, even as the Massachusetts governor was
crushing him in primaries in California, Montana, New Jersey and New
Mexico.
   Jackson declared flatly he deserves consideration for the
nomination _ a point Dukakis has agreed with _ even though he hasn't
made up his mind about an offer.
   ``I've not yet made that decision. But I have certainly earned
consideration,'' Jackson said after the votes were tallied Tuesday.
   And the civil rights leader added a new twist to his demands:
that Dukakis balance his ticket ideologically with a liberal.
   ``Mr. Dukakis said in many ways, he is more conservative than
George Bush,'' Jackson said. ``He has the right to express his point
of view....So he is a fiscal conservative.
   ``It means the ticket must be balanced, therefore with a
progressive.''
   Such a characterization cannot help but please the liberal
Massachusetts governor _ if only privately.
   When the leading proponent of the Democratic party's left wing
calls you a conservative, it is a useful antidote to the attacks
from Bush.
   The Republican nominee-to-be has been trying mightily in the past
two months to paint Dukakis as a far-out liberal _ as a George
McGovern dove on defense and a Walter Mondale tax-raiser in budget
matters.
   Such attacks are designed to frame the general election race in a
straightforward liberal-conservative terms, a structure Dukakis
would like to forget about as he talks of change and efficient
management of government without reference to ideology.
   There are substantial pitfalls for Dukakis in this short-term
contest of wills with Jackson.
   He must, of course, avoid alienating Jackson or his constituents
as the battles continue through Atlanta. He needs the enthusiastic
support of Jackson's backers and a big turnout from them on Nov. 8
if he is beat Bush.
   Any refusal to talk to Jackson, to listen at length to his
concerns would fly in the face of his demand that his supporters
``must be heard respectfully at every level'' in the party.
   And any direct attacks on Jackson by Dukakis would cause problems
in the fall.
   Unlike some other Democratic hopefuls, Dukakis also avoided much
criticism of Jackson, something the civil rights leader noted in
praising Dukakis for running a campaign ``free of demagoguery and
attacks.''
   But Dukakis has given every indication of understanding the need
to consult with Jackson, to talk with him and to meet with him.
   It's a long way to Atlanta for Dukakis and Jackson.
   But this political odd couple may be working out their
differences in ways that could ultimately contribute to a goal both
share _ a goal which can now be stated as putting Dukakis in the
White House in January 1989.

   Michael Dukakis clinched the Democratic presidential nomination
with a four-state flourish Tuesday night and forecast a ``golden
opportunity'' to win the White House in 1988. Republican George Bush
labeled himself the underdog heading into the fall campaign but
said, ``I'm fighting back.''
   Dukakis dominated Jesse Jackson coast to coast on the final night
of a grueling Democratic primary marathon. He was winning primaries
in New Jersey, Montana, New Mexico and California by margins of
better than 2-to-1.
   The three-term Massachusetts governor began the night needing
roughly 150 elegates to achieve a mathematical lock on the
nomination, and he wound up with about 200 more than that. He was
winning more than 131 in New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico
combined, and early returns from California showed him ahead for
more than 200 delegates.
   Dukakis emerged as the winner of the grueling Democratic primary
marathon and owner of a lead over Bush in the nationwide public
opinion polls. But Bush, who wrapped up the GOP nomination six weeks
ago, holds formidable Electoral College advantages in the South and
West, and Republicans have won four of the last five presidential
elections.
   Thus, the prospect is for a close general election, and Bush and
Dukakis seemed to share an eagerness to begin.
   ``My friends, what a golden opportunity this is for us,'' Dukakis
said as he savored his nominating triumph in a speech in California.
He pledged to use his campaign to stand up for factory workers
thrown out of their jobs with no warning, to ease the burden of
families hit by medical bills and to ``share the rage'' of those
living in neighborhoods threatened by drugs.
   ``Every day between now and November, the American people will
want to hear how we intend to build a strong and vibrant future for
our country. They aren't interested in slashing attacks. They want
to judge our positive ideas for change,'' he said.
   Bush posted uncontested primary victories in all four states and
said, ``I think I can overcome this deficit (in the polls),'' he
said. ``I'm fighting back. I'm the underdog now.''
   The vice president agreed there was no need for a ``negative,
nasty campaign.''
   In a television interview, he also likened Dukakis to Walter F.
Mondale, the landslide Democratic loser in 1984, for refusing to
rule out a tax increase. ``I'll rule it out,'' Bush said in an
interview with CBS, and rely on a spending freeze to reduce the
deficit.
   He decried the ``gloom and doom'' he said was emanating from the
Democrats and said the polls would change as he begins to establish
his own political identity. ``When we get through in the fall
talking about opportunity and peace and numbers of jobs and how much
better things are and what I'll do to keep it that way, I think I
can overcome that deficit,'' he said.
   Jackson offered Dukakis congratulations for running a race ``free
of demagoguery and attacks,'' but said he would offer no endorsement
before the nominating convention in Atlanta next month.
   ``I salute him for a fine campaign ... We have shown it is
possible to compete without conflict and differ without division,''
Jackson said.
   He said he hadn't yet decided if he would accept an offer to be
Dukakis' vice presidential running mate _ an offer that some Dukakis
aides view as extremely unlikely. ``But I have certainly earned
consideration,'' Jackson added.
   Both Dukakis and Bush will spend the next several weeks doing
what they can to assure party unity, plan their nominating
conventions and select vice presidential running mates.
   Dukakis said he wasn't going to rule ``anybody in or out'' at
this point in his search for a ticket mate, and that included
Jackson. He can expect a possible floor fight from his last
Democratic primary rival on a handful of issues. But he said as he
savored his nominating triumph, ``We're going to go to Atlanta (site
of the Democratic convention) united. We're going to come out of
Atlanta united.''
   Jackson, routed in the four final primaries of the year, already
was turning his attention to the next phase of a remarkable
campaign. Talk of the vice presidential nomination, convention
platform issues and changes in party rules affecting future
campaigns was in the air even before the polling places opened to
voters on the final primary day of the year.
   Bush already has been endorsed by the men he defeated for the
nomination, and will attend the first of five GOP unity dinners
later this week in Denver.

   A successful launch rehearsal that
ended with a mock emergency landing will make it easier to conduct
the real thing when space shuttle flights resume, NASA officials
say.
   The launch team here, flight controllers in Houston and rescue,
weather, safety and other support crews on Tuesday practiced the
final three hours of a countdown, followed by a shuttle ``liftoff''
on a flight cut short minutes later when computers simulated the
failure of two main engines.
   Three astronauts, ``flying'' the mission in a Houston simulator,
reacted swiftly to the planned failure and guided themselves
through a tricky set of manauevers to a safe ``landing'' on a
runway just 3 miles from the Kennedy Space Center launch pad.
   The exercise evaluated hundreds of management, procedural,
hardware and software changes that are the result of the explosion
that destroyed Challenger and its seven-member crew on Jan. 28,
1986. Most of the changes are aimed at improved safety.
   It was the most comprehensive rehearsal yet for the first
post-Challenger flight, scheduled for late August.
   Under the new management structure, astronaut Bob Crippen,
deputy director of shuttle launch operations, will make the final
decision on whether to launch a shuttle.
   He and his main adviser, launch director Bob Sieck, had ample
oportunity to exercise their judgments Tuesday as intentional
electrical, communications and other problems were built into the
countdown to give controllers experience in resolving them.
   Crippen, who flew on four shuttle missions, said the test showed
some areas of problem-solving that needed to be improved, but ``all
in all, it was an excellent exercise.''
   In Houston, Lee Briscoe, a flight director who helped coordinate
the simulation, said it ``increased the confidence'' of the
management team.
   ``We exercised the whole team,'' he said. ``Communications were
good, the data flow was good. I was pleased with the way it went.''
   Many milestones still must be passed before the shuttle
Discovery makes the next flight. The spaceship is undergoing final
checks here after an extensive overhaul of several systems and is
scheduled to be mated next week with its two solid fuel booster
rockets and external fuel tank.
   Transfer to the launch pad is planned June 27, with a
test-firing of the three main engines scheduled there on July 19.
   Two more tests of the redesigned booster rockets are scheduled
for June 10 and July 26 at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah. A
faulty joint in one rocket was blamed for the Challenger accident.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis won support in the
California and New Jersey primaries from two groups whose support
will be crucial in the November election _ Reagan Democrats and
Jesse Jackson backers.
   Dukakis wrapped up his party's nomination with victories Tuesday
in the two states, along with contests in Montana and New Mexico.
   Exit polls after the races showed Dukakis maintaining the broad
ideological appeal he has maintained throughout the later
primaries. He even was rated favorably by a sizable share of
Republicans.
   The Massachusetts governor remained somewhat ill-defined in the
eyes of voters; ABC News found that nearly a quarter of the
Democrats in both states were not sure where to place him
ideologically. Analysts said that could prove a plus or a minus.
   ``It's an indication he's run a moderate campaign,'' said ABC
pollster John Brennan. ``It also indicates people haven't
scrutinized him closely. He's all things to all people.''
   While Dukakis paints himself as a moderate, therefore, the
Republicans may find an opening to call him a liberal.
   Still, the polls contained chiefly good news for Dukakis as he
looks ahead to November.
   CBS News-New York Times polls said about a quarter of the
Democratic primary voters in both states supported President Reagan
in 1984, and nearly two-thirds of them favored Dukakis over George
Bush this year.
   At the same time, a majority of the Democrats who supported
Jackson said they would back Dukakis over Bush for president. And
sizable shares of Republicans and Jackson voters alike viewed
Dukakis favorably.
   ``Republicans are not turned off by Dukakis,'' said I.A. Lewis,
pollster for The Los Angeles Times. Across the political spectrum,
he added, ``Look at Jackson voters; they are not unfavorable to
Dukakis. So it won't be so hard for them to bind up their wounds.''
   Thirty-six percent of Jackson's voters in the Los Angeles Times'
poll had a favorable opinion of Dukakis, to 32 percent unfavorable
and 32 percent with no opinion. In the 1984 and 1980 Democratic
primaries in California, backers of the losers were far more
antagonistic toward the winners, Lewis noted.
   ABC and CBS-Times polls found that more than 60 percent of
Jackson's supporters in both states said they would vote for
Dukakis over Bush in November. Although as many as 30 percent said
they would not vote, ABC poll analyst Doug Muzzio said disappointed
primary voters historically turn out in greater numbers in November
than they indicate in the spring.
   Among Republicans, the L.A. Times poll said 29 percent had a
favorable opinion of Dukakis to 40 percent unfavorable and 31
percent with no opinion. Lewis said favorable ratings usually are
far lower for an opposing party's candidate.
   ABC poll results from New Jersey said Dukakis continued to
appeal to Democrats across the ideological spectrum. He won
majorities of liberals, moderates and conservatives, and 56 percent
of all Democrats said his views were ``just about right'' as
opposed to too liberal or too conservative.
   Dukakis scored somewhat less strongly in California, where 49
percent of Democrats rated his views ``just about right.'' Liberals
dominate the state party, and 19 percent of the Democrats rated
Dukakis ``too conservative.'' That group voted overwhelmingly for
Jackson.
   Dukakis also won more committed support in New Jersey, where the
CBS-Times poll found that 54 percent of his voters backed him
strongly, more than in most earlier races. In California, 49
percent of Dukakis supporters said they had some reservations about
him, to 38 percent who were strong.
   Voters in both states cited experience and strong leadership as
their chief reasons for supporting Dukakis, areas in which he has
not been rated as strongly in the past, said CBS pollster Keating
Holland. He said Dukakis' greater strength in New Jersey could
reflect a regional bias for a fellow Northeasterner.
   The exit polls showed a continuing racial division in the
Democratic vote. Jackson won about a quarter of the white vote in
California _ one of his best showings among whites _ but only 9
percent in New Jersey, one of his worst showings with whites. He
got more than 90 percent of the black vote in both states.
   ABC's polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage
points; the CBS-Times poll had a four-point margin, the L.A. Times
poll, three points; NBC's, two points.

<HEAD>CBS Rejects Cronkite's Proposal for Kennedy Special</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS has rejected Walter Cronkite's proposal to
anchor a prime-time special report this fall on the 25th
anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   The project was Cronkite's first proposal in an effort to find a
more meaningful role at CBS, The New York Times reported today,
quoting people associated with the project.
   CBS is negotiating to keep Cronkite from leaving the network.
   ``I thought it was a pretty good idea and I still think it is a
good idea,'' Cronkite said. ``I hope that others can get it on
somewhere else.''
   Cronkite, who is leaving for a monthlong trip overseas, said his
representative, Ron Konecky, will continue to negotiate with CBS on
his behalf.
   Gene Jankowski, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, declined
to comment.
   When Cronkite left as anchor of the ``CBS Evening News'' in 1981
after 14 years as the top-rated network newscaster, he was made a
special correspondent with an annual salary of about $1 million.
   Two former CBS News presidents, Van Gordon Sauter and Edward M.
Joyce, acknowledged that Cronkite was shut out from the ``CBS
Evening News'' to ensure that his successor, Dan Rather, would not
be uncomfortable, the Times said.
   Cronkite, a member of the CBS board, has occasionally criticized
Rather's broadcast style as being too soft.
   Cronkite has recently said he may leave the network when the
first phase of his contract expires on Nov. 4, his 72nd birthday.
That phase binds him exclusively to CBS.
   According to the contract, Cronkite will be paid $150,000 a year
for the next 10 years as a network consultant. The current
negotiations began this spring after Cronkite told CBS that he did
not consider that agreement to be exclusive and that he intended to
consider other offers.
   Cronkite's performance as chief anchor during the four-day
nonstop coverage of the Nov. 22, 1963, Kennedy assassination is
regarded as the foundation of his near-mythical status as a
broadcaster. Public opinion polls found that he was ``the most
trusted man in America.''

<TEXT>
   A fire razed an apartment complex under
construction and jumped to neighboring buildings, sending up smoke
that could be seen 60 miles away and causing $6 million in damage,
authorities said.
   The 204-unit apartment, at the wood-framing stage of
construction, burned to the ground in less than hour after it broke
out at 5:45 p.m. Tuesday, said fire department spokeswoman Sharon
Frank.
   ``This is what you call a cooker,'' Ms. Frank said. ``It's a
construction fire so you've got piles of lumber everywhere, all
kinds of flammable materials.''
   Flames jumped to a neighboring Victorian house and several
business storefronts, Ms. Frank added. The house sustained severe
damage before firefighters contained the fast-moving blaze at about
8 p.m., she said.
   The house was occupied, but nobody was inside when it ignited,
Ms. Frank said.
   Flames also leaped to the roof of a nearby two-story building
owned by the Salvation Army, she said.
   A huge pillar of smoke rose over Orange County and could be seen
as far away as Malibu, 60 miles away.
   One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion and released.
   No other injuries were reported in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $6 million damage, Ms. Frank said.
   Investigators were waiting for the charred rubble to cool before
searching for clues to the cause of the fire, Ms. Frank said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 10 new plays by established American
playwrights could make it to New York within the next two years
under an ambitious plan developed by three producers and a major
Broadway theater owner.
   The American Playwrights Project will commission works from such
writers as Christopher Durang, David Henry Hwang, Marsha Norman,
Terrence McNally, David Rabe, Wendy Wasserstein and four more
authors to be named later.
   The project, financed at $200,000, was announced Tuesday by
producers James B. Freydberg, Max Weitzenhoffer and Stephen Graham,
and Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway playhouses.
   ``I was concerned about the fact that there were fewer American
plays on Broadway than any other season,'' said Freydberg, producer
of Lanford Wilson's ``Burn This,'' one of only six American plays
that opened on Broadway during the 1987-88 season.
   ``We have formed the American Playwrights Project for a simple
reason: to get product,'' he said, but added that the project will
not own an option on these works and will not influence what
happens to them artistically.
   ``For example, there may be several readings of a play and then
it would go to a regional theater if they were interested and from
there the play might travel to New York,'' said Freydberg.
   ``But there is no guarantee a show will come to Broadway,'' he
said. ``There is no guarantee that we would end up producing it. If
we didn't, we would have a small interest in the show for the
purpose of recouping the cost of the commission, which we would
then use to commission somebody else.''
   Each of the playwrights will receive appromimately $15,000 in
commissions.
   Many of the details are still be worked out, said Hwang, whose
``M. Butterfly'' won a Tony Award on Sunday as best play of the
Broadway season.
   ``I see it as an intention to work together at this point,'' he
said.
   Miss Wasserstein, author of the off-Broadway hit ``Isn't It
Romantic?,'' said she was approached about the project by several
people including Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn. She said
she had agreed to it, although no contracts have been signed.
   ``I always find commissions useful because they make you write
the play,'' she said. ``They said we should come in and give them a
general idea of what we are going to write. But it's pretty much
anything. I think that's what's appealing about it.''

<HEAD>Government Ordered to Grant Visas to Four Barred</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the government to
grant visas to Nicaragua's interior minister and three others
barred from entering the country because of their membership in
communist or communist-affiliated groups.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene reversed an earlier finding
that had been set aside by a federal appeals court, ruling on
Tuesday that Nicaraguan Interior Minister Tomas Borge, two Cuban
officials and a former Italian senator should be admitted to accept
speaking engagements at the invitation of U.S. citizens.
   Greene said the State Department had violated the 1952
Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the four visas simply
because the applicants were members of communist or
communist-affiliated organizations.
   The American Civil Liberties Union argued that to bar someone,
the law requires the State Department to determine that an alien's
proposed activities during the visit _ as opposed to political
affiliations _ would endanger U.S. interests.

   Amtrak Chairman W. Graham Claytor says he
expects to expand the rail system's capacity under the next
president, Democrat or Republican, after weathering years of
attacks by the Reagan administration on federal subsidies.
   ``Congress has rejected ... proposals to terminate Amtrak for
four successive years,'' W. Graham Claytor told reporters on
Tuesday.
   He said he hopes both the Democratic and Republican parties will
go on record in favor of federal support for the national passenger
rail system. ``I'm optimistic this will be the position of a new
administration, whether Republican or Democratic,'' he said.
   Claytor said that after fighting for survival, Amtrak's main
goal now is expanding services.
   ``The principal problem we see ahead is capacity. ... On
weekends and holidays we don't have the equipment to accommodate
peak loads on our unreserved Northeast Corridor trains'' between
Boston and Washington, he said.

   A Senate subcommittee has followed the House
in approving a spending bill for energy and water development that
includes no money to begin construction of water projects next year.
   Chairman Bennett Johnston, D-La., said the Appropriations energy
and water development subcommittee rejected requests on Tuesday for
nearly three dozen new dams, irrigation systems and harbor
improvements.
   ``If we make any exceptions, the dam is broken and the flood
starts,'' said Johnston.
   The appropriations legislation for fiscal 1989, which begins
Oct. 1, contains $18.05 billion but nothing for new starts by the
Army Corps of Engineers or the Interior Department's Bureau of
Reclamation.
   The House last month approved a $17.8 billion version of the
bill that also included plans for no new construction starts.

<HEAD>Jail Suicides Nine Times Higher Than Rate for General Populace,</HEAD>

   Study Shows

<TEXT>
   Suicide is the leading cause of death in
the nation's jails, where the suicide rate for inmates is nine
times that of the general population, according to a new study.
   The federally financed study also said that more than half the
inmates who commit suicide kill themselves in the first day after
they are arrested and many are in jail because of alcohol or drug
problems.
   ``Although the average length of stay in jail is approximately 6
to 11 days, 51 percent of all jail suicide victims were dead within
the first 24 hours of incarceration and 29 percent committed
suicide within the first three hours,'' the National Center on
Institutions and Alternatives said.
   Lindsay M. Hayes directed the project, which was supported
through a grant from the National Institute of Corrections in the
Department of Justice. Hayes said the suicide rate in detention
facilities was found to be 107 per 100,000 inmates. Census Bureau
studies show the rate is 12.5 per 100,000 in the general
population, he said.

<HEAD>33 Nations Recommend Lifting Ban on Mineral Exploitation of
Antarctica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-three nations have
recommended lifting a ban on mineral exploitation of Antarctica,
believed to be rich in gold, oil, coal and other resources.
   Approval of a 100-page document called the Antarctic Minerals
Convention came despite the objections of environmentalists at a
monthlong conference that ended last week.
   Chris Beeby, New Zealand's deputy secretary of foreign affairs
and chairman of the conference, said the convention, approved
Thursday, offers the strongest protection possible for the
unspoiled Antarctic environment.
   But the environmental group Greenpeace and other
non-governmental groups included in the discussions called the
environmental safeguards inadequate.
   The convention's provisions include creating an Antarctic
minerals resource commission to oversee the region's development.
   The United States, which was represented at the meeting,
estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum
reserves.
   The convention must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of the
Antarctic Treaty's 20 members, including the seven with land claims
in Antarctica, before it would take effect.
   Beeby predicted the convention ``will go down in Antarctic
history as the most important political development regarding the
regulation of Antarctica since the Antarctic treaty itself was
adopted in 1959.'' The treaty regulates activities in Antarctica.
   Conservationists, who pushed to have the region protected as a
``world park,'' disagreed.
   Greenpeace spokesman Roger Wilson said the agreement was reached
only by ``bludgeoning'' environmentally minded nations into
submission.
   He said the convention looked good on paper but would not
protect the environment in practice.
   Beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will begin
soon.
   A moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 and
will remain until the convention is ratified, delegates said.
   Antarctica is double the size of the United States. Countries
with land claims are Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Chile,
Norway, Argentina and France.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of chanting demonstrators
took to the streets of the capital to protest a new law declaring
Islam the state religion of Bangladesh.
   The demonstrators _ supporters of opposition political parties,
labor groups and students _ burned two trucks and stoned seven
government buses and a police jeep as they marched through Dhaka
Tuesday night, witnesses said.
   Several thousand security personnel were posted at key points
but did not interfere with the demonstrators. There were no reports
of injuries or arrests.
   Parliament approved the bill by a 254-to-0 vote Tuesday after 15
opposition lawmakers walked out. President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad's Jatiya Party holds 252 of the assembly's 300 seats, and
two independents joined them in the vote.
   Nearly 90 percent of Bangladesh's 105 million people are
Moslems, but the bill had drawn considerable criticism from
opposition parties, women's groups and minority Christian, Hindu
and Buddhist religions.
   Opposition leader Khaleda Zia said in a statement after the vote
Tuesday: ``The illegal law, bringing about basic change in the
Constitution, undermining the independence of the judiciary and
giving birth to communalism, is nothing but a far-reaching
conspiracy to divide the nation.''
   The present Parliament was elected March 3 in elections largely
boycotted by the nation's 48 million voters. Mrs. Zia called the
assembly ``illegal'' and said it ``had no right to transact
legislative business.''
   Nirmal Sen, head of the Alliance of Five Parties said the law
would divide the nation between Moslems and non-Moslems.
   But Syed Deedar Bakht, the Jatiya whip in Parliament, said the
law would ``ensure communal harmony'' and ``encourage the
non-Moslems to follow their faiths in total freedom.''
   ``I find no reason for the womenfolk to worry about the law as
under Islam, both men and women are treated with greater kindness
in Islam than in any other religion,'' he said in an interview.
   The bill amends the constitution to insert the sentence: ``The
religion of the republic is Islam, but other religions may be
practiced in peace and harmony.''
   Before the bill was passed, Prime Minister Maudud Ahmed told
Parliament the measure was needed ``to free Islam from the hands of
fundamentalists and the traders of religion.'' He tried to assure
minority groups they need not fear the amendment.
   A senior Law Ministry official said there were no plans to
rewrite the nation's Anglo-Saxon-based civil law to make it comply
with religious law, and a Cabinet miniser said there was no need to.
   But Maleka Begum, secretary general of the Women's Council, said
the law was ``against the concept of the war of liberation.'' She
said Moslem fundamentalists would use it to ``force the
introduction of puritan Islamic laws.''

<TEXT>
   A costly new long-term home health care plan
arrives on the House floor against the backdrop of a coming
election and a series of polls indicating public desire for such a
program.
   The home care bill is championed by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
who said Tuesday he had been trying for 50 years to help fill ``a
total vacuum'' in the area of long-term care.
   But two spurned committee chairmen whose panels never got a
chance to review the bill spearheaded an effort to block its
consideration on the House floor today.
   ``We should not allow the rules of the House to be manipulated
to satisfy the popular issue of the moment,'' Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesday in a
letter to his colleagues.
   Pepper's plan would expand Medicare to include long-term home
care benefits for anyone of any age who is chronically ill or can't
perform tasks of daily living.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., the Senate sponsor of the Pepper bill,
said 30 percent of the people in nursing homes would not have to be
there if home services were available.
   ``We're going to have an explosion in the demand for long-term
care and we ought to face up to it now,'' he said at a news
conference Tuesday with Pepper and others.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the home care program
would cost nearly $28 billion over five years. Backers say it would
be paid for by imposing the Medicare payroll tax on income above
$45,000, which is currently exempt, but opponents are skeptical,
saying the cost could balloon out of control.
   Ordinarily, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Energy
and Commerce Committee would have worked on the Pepper bill before
it reached the floor.
   But under a special arrangement between Pepper and House Speaker
Jim Wright, Pepper agreed not to offer his home care plan as an
amendment to an already controversial catastrophic health bill
dealing with the cost of acute illness. In return, Wright agreed to
let him have a floor vote on his bill.
   The move allowed the bill to bypass Rostenkowski's committee and
the Energy and Commerce panel led by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Republican and Democratic opponents, though lauding the intent
of Pepper's bill, said they had problems with the way it got to the
House floor, its cost, its lack of a nursing home component, and
the absence of agencies capable of administering the plan.
   ``History has demonstrated that such a big program cannot be put
in place quickly without encouraging inept or fraudulent
management,'' Rostenkowski said. He also said CBO estimates show
the program would face an annual deficit within five years.
   In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter dated today, Pepper and his
co-sponsor, Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., said the cost and
procedural questions were ``bogus'' reasons to oppose their bill.
   They said no procedural rules were violated and the bill
contains a cap on costs. While they did not mention their in-House
opponents, they condemned outside groups fighting the bill _
particularly the insurance industry _ as serving ``their own narrow
self-interest, not the American people's interest.''
   Pepper assembled a group of influential lawmakers at a
rally-the-troops news conference Tuesday. Among them were Sen.
Edward Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, and Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the Energy and
Commerce health subcommittee.
   The political pressure on representatives was enormous. Polls
this year have shown public support for a new government program
for long-term care, and every member of the House is up for
re-election in five months.
   In addition, Pepper, 87, a nationally known champion of the
elderly, has personally campaigned on behalf of many members, and
his bill was the only shot at a long-term care program of any kind
in the 100th Congress.
   Rostenkowski suggested that Pepper and Wright had put lawmakers
in an untenable position. He said the committee system ``protects
members from being forced to vote on popular-appearing proposals
that may ultimately prove to be embarrassing.''
   Pepper, chairman of the powerful rules committee that schedules
floor action, scheduled his own bill after reaching the agreement
with Wright. But he dismissed the idea that he was setting a bad
precedent that could become routine. ``The rules committee is not
going to run rampant over anybody,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cholesterol Screening Gets People To Doctor, Study Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half those who were informed in
community screening programs that their cholesterol levels were
high contacted a doctor within two months, an encouraging sign for
such programs, a study says.
   That showed ``very good followup for the amount of time that had
passed,'' said Reagan Bradford, director of the Oklahoma Lipid
Research Clinic in Oklahoma City.
   Bradford spoke Tuesday at a symposium on cholesterol sponsored
by the American Medical Association.
   His results came from about 13,000 people who went through
pin-prick blood tests for cholesterol at shopping malls, schools
and other public places.
   About 70 percent of those who had seen a doctor received
confirmation that their levels were high, and had started a diet
prescribed by the physician, Bradford said.
   Other studies suggest that perhaps 40 percent of those who go
through such screening will be told to see a doctor, he said.
   Also at the symposium, George Gallup Jr. said a new poll found
that 31 percent of adolescents said they were greatly concerned
about heart disease or a heart attack. But their eating habits were
about the same as those who did not express such concern, the
pollster said.
   Apparently they believe other things are more important in life
than controlling cholesterol intake, he said. And adolescents
appear to have only limited knowledge about how to avoid
cholesterol in the diet, he said.
   His organization polled 375 adolescents, ages 12 to 17, from
March 28 to April 10. Findings should be accurate within 5
percentage points, the organization said.
   Among its findings about the youths:
   _ Seventy percent knew that diet can reduce blood cholesterol
levels. Ninety-three percent said it was ``very'' or ``fairly''
important for young people to control their cholesterol intake.
   _ About 90 percent correctly identified fried foods and butter
as contributing to high cholesterol levels. Only 31 percent
correctly put ice cream in that category.
   _ Some 24 percent said they avoid fried foods. Of those who said
they avoid some foods because of cholesterol, about half cited
fried foods, and 30 percent named butter.
   _ Twenty-three percent overall said they eat eggs, which contain
cholesterol, for breakfast three or more times a week.
   _ Fifty-nine percent said they eat a good deal of beef.
   The poll was commissioned by the pharmaceutical company Merck
Sharpe and Dohme.

<TEXT>
   The second sale in as many years at the Dallas
Times Herald won't spell any drastic changes for the newspaper as
it battles in one of the country's most competitive markets, the
new editor says.
   ``I think it's been a quality paper for the last couple of
years,'' Roy Bode said Tuesday. ``I'm sure there are things we can
do to improve it, but I have no plans for major changes.''
   MediaNews Holdings Inc., controlled by Times Herald Chairman
William Dean Singleton, is selling the paper to DTH Media Inc., a
new corporation controlled by MediaNews stockholder John Buzzetta,
a longtime business partner of Singleton.
   Rumors had been circulating for weeks about the pending sale of
the Times Herald, which has had marginal profits in the face of a
weak state economy and is locked in battle with the larger Dallas
Morning News.
   Buzzetta, 38, will become publisher of the Times Herald,
replacing Art Wible. Bode, a former associate editor of the paper,
is replacing C. David Burgin.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but in a story today the
Times Herald quoted sources as saying Buzzetta and two partners in
the venture _ Equitable Capital Management and Dillon, Read & Co. _
paid $110 million to $120 million to acquire the newspaper.
   Buzzetta said in a statement, ``A substantial amount of cash and
stock was involved in the transaction.''
   Singleton and a partner, Richard B. Scudder, acquired the Times
Herald, the second-largest paper in Dallas, in late 1986 for $110
million from Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles. As part of the deal,
they received $7 million that the newspaper had in the bank, as
well as a $20 million discount for paying early, bringing their
total cost to $83 million.
   Buzzetta said DTH Media Inc. will have a controlling interest
while MediaNews will retain a financial interest in the newspaper
and will remain a stockholder.
   Burgin, general manager Robert Hollingsworth and senior vice
president and chief financial officer Richard L. Jacobs will join
MediaNews Group.
   Singleton, 37, who was in Denver on Tuesday in meetings at The
Denver Post, which he also owns, said in a statement that proceeds
from the transaction will go toward retiring debt and for new
acquisitions.
   ``The proposal was attractive enough financially that it had to
be considered seriously,'' he said.
   Bode, 39, worked at the Times Herald from 1977 to 1986 before
leaving to become editor and vice president of The North Jersey
Herald & News, which is part of Singleton's privately held
MediaNews Group. He recently left that post.
   No layoffs are expected in the Times Herald newsroom, Bode and
Buzzetta said.
   ``This will be a stable ownership and we agree too many changes
aren't good for a paper and this paper shouldn't be seeing too many
more,'' Bode said. ``We're here to stay.''
   Two weeks ago, the Morning News and the Times Herald agreed to
drop lawsuits filed against each other concerning paid circulation
figures.
   The latest figures released through the Audit Bureau of
Circulation for the six months ended Sept. 30, 1986, showed the
Times Herald's daily circulation was 246,370 and the Morning News'
was 390,987. On Sunday, the Times Herald's reported paid
circulation was 338,963, and the Morning News reported 531,417.
   Last year, the Times Herald had an operating profit of about $9
million on total revenue of about $120 million, sources told the
newspaper, but earnings and sales have slumped in 1988.

   First-term Sen. Frank Lautenberg looked
forward to a costly re-election bid after his overwhelming
Democratic primary victory, and a congressional primary assured New
Jersey of its first black congressman.
   ``We are spending more on this race than we ever have before,''
Lautenberg, 64, said after an overwhelming victory Tuesday. ``The
race is one that people are looking at, but I don't know what it
will cost.''
   Donald Payne, a Democratic Newark city councilman, won the
heavily Democratic 10th District primary, virtually assuring him of
becoming the state's first black member in Congress.
   In the Democratic presidential primary, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis won most of the state's 109 convention delegates;
Vice President George Bush was unopposed for 64 delegates.
   Lautenberg, seen by Republicans as one of the Senate's most
vulnerable Democrats, will face retired Army Gen. Peter Dawkins,
who ran unopposed for the GOP's nomination, and has popular Gov.
Thomas H. Kean as his campaign chairman.
   The two candidates expect to spend a combined total of $14
million.
   With 5,794 of 5,825 precincts, or 99 percent, reporting,
Lautenberg had 319,395 votes, or 77.6 percent; Elnardo Webster, a
state Corrections official, had 50,801 votes, or 12.3 percent; and
theology student Harold Young, a self-styled ``conservative radical
Democrat,'' had 41,157 votes, or 10 percent.
   Lautenberg founded and built Automatic Data Processing Corp.
into a worldwide company. He spent more than $3 million of his own
money in 1982 _ then thought an incredible amount _ to beat
pipe-smoking Rep. Millicent Fenwick.
   He and Dawkins went on the offensive after Tuesday's primary
votes were counted.
   ``There will be a very clear and distinct difference between
myself and Frank Lautenberg,'' said Dawkins, 50, a Heisman trophy
winner, war hero and Rhodes scholar who has never held public
office.
   Dawkins has proposed a 10-point plan against drug abuse and says
he will campaign on themes that include the environment, education
and the federal budget deficit.
   Rodino said during the 1986 campaign that he would retire when
President Reagan left office in January 1989. Minority officials in
the district, including Payne, held Rodino to that promise.
   ``It's been a trip that we've been waging for many years,''
Payne told cheering supporters after defeating a fellow Newark
councilman, Ralph T. Grant, who also is black. ``We have ended one
step of this trip,''
   ``There are really no more impossible dreams,'' Payne said.
   With 98 percent of 328 precincts reporting, Payne had 39,681
votes, or 73 percent, to 14,576 votes, or 27 percent, for Grant.
   The candidates have focused on the same platform: fight drugs,
house the homeless, help the elderly and bring in jobs.
   Third District voters chose former state Assemblyman Joseph
Azzolina from five Republicans to vie against Democratic state Sen.
Frank J. Pallone Jr. for the seat left vacant by the March 25 death
of Democratic Rep. James Howard.
   Voters also chose Azzolina to meet Pallone in a special November
contest to fill the two months that will remain in Howard's term.
With 100 percent of the precincts reporting, Azzolina had 68
percent of the vote in the five-way race.
   Pallone was unopposed in both primaries.
   In addition to the 3rd and 10th districts, 12 incumbents in the
House will seek re-election in November. Only two faced primary
opposition and won handily.

<TEXT>
   An 11{-foot-wide honeycombed piece of glass
got rave reviews from engineers and an astronomer who hope a new
casting process will produce the next generation of cheaper, more
powerful telescopes.
   ``It is perfect,'' engineer Edward Mannery said Tuesday after
the lid was taken off a special furnace and he examined the glass
blank, which will be ground and polished into a telescope mirror.
   ``It couldn't be better at this point,'' said astronomer Roger
Angel, who heads the Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory at the
University of Arizona and devised the new process.
   The blank was spun-cast six weeks ago using centrifugal force,
then gradually cooled until the furnace was shut off last weekend.
At 3.5 meters (about 11{ feet) wide, it is the largest made with
the new method.
   The finished mirror will go into a telescope being built in the
Sacramento Mountains near Sun Spot, N.M., by the Astrophysical
Research Consortium.
   Consortium members are the University of Chicago, the University
of Washington, Princeton University, New Mexico State University
and Washington State University.
   Mannery, a University of Washington engineer representing the
consortium, measured the thickness of the blank's surface with an
electronic device as others inspected the glass for bubbles or
other flaws.
   ``If nothing went wrong, we expected the face plate thickness to
be 1.75 inches,'' Mannery said. ``It's just the thickness it was
supposed to be.''
   He said the glass also appears to have an exceptionally low
number of the bubbles that form during casting.
   ``In the next two or three weeks, we'll gradually unmold this
glass, and I would say probably in about three weeks we'll have
gotten right deep into it and I think we'll know really what we've
got there,'' Angel said.
   The blank's surface, which will be ground and polished by a
Tucson optical company, is nearly half an inch over the thickness
needed.
   In about a week, a special crane called a Whiffletree will lift
the blank from the furnace, and about 4,000 pounds of molding
material used to create the hollow honeycomb support structure will
be removed, Angel said.
   ``The mirror is very fragile at this point,'' he said,
explaining that small cracks caused by the mold have the potential
for becoming a big crack.
   Many astronomers hope the process can be used to build strong,
lightweight mirrors that are more powerful because they have more
deeply curved surfaces.
   This translates to great savings in time and money because the
new telescopes can be housed in smaller buildings, Angel and other
proponents say.
   Angel said another 3.5-meter mirror will be cast for another
consortium later this year.
   Other commitments include two mirrors 26 feet wide for a
binocular-like telescope called the Columbus Project. That project
involves Arizona and Chicago universities, Ohio State University
and Italian astronomers.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser may never go
on trial on federal racketeering and embezzlement charges, say
doctors who predict he will die of brain cancer within six months.
   U.S. District Judge George White on Tuesday postponed Presser's
trial indefinitely after reviewing letters from four doctors and
talking to a surgeon at the Phoenix, Ariz., hospital where Presser
is hospitalized.
   White ruled that two co-defendants will stand trial July 12.
   Presser, 61, has been receiving radiation treatment at the
Barrow Neurological Institute following removal of a cancerous
lesion from his brain May 17.
   Dr. Robert Spetzler, director of the hospital, told White by
telephone that Presser showed some improvement Monday.
   ``I don't believe Presser will ever be free of this disease,''
said Spetzler.
   He said Presser is being treated with radiation for another
brain lesion and may have two others. Spetzler said the cancer
started in a lung, spread to the brain and could develop elsewhere.
   Dr. Leslie Sheeler of the Cleveland Clinic wrote on May 26 that
the prognosis for the type of cancer Presser has ``is in general
very poor. The expected survival is something like six months.
   ``Mr. Presser is quite impaired mentally,'' Sheeler wrote. ``He
has virtually no short-term memory.''
   Spetzler, responding to questions from Lynch, confirmed
Sheeler's diagnosis. He said, however, that if Presser continues
his slow improvement, a review in four to six months may show him
competent to stand trial.
   White called Spetzler at the request of prosecutor William Lynch.
   Presser, Anthony Hughes and Harold Friedman are accused of
participating in a $700,000 payroll padding scheme at Teamsters
Local 507 in Cleveland, where Presser is secretary-treasurer.
   Presser last month relinquished his presidential post for four
months because of his health problems. National Secretary-Treasurer
Weldon Mathis is serving as president.
   Friedman is Local 507's president and an international vice
president. Hughes is the local's secretary.
   Presser's attorney, John Climaco, said Presser wanted the trial
to continue and wants to testify.
   Climaco said Presser is innocent and was an FBI informant who
was authorized to hire ``ghost employees,'' people on the payroll
who performed no work.

   A Republican state senator and former
Albuquerque dentist says he will use Sen. Jeff Bingaman's record to
thwart the Democrat's run for a second term in the U.S. Senate.
   ``Throughout this campaign, we'll talk about Jeff Bingaman's
record,'' said Bill Valentine after topping a four-man GOP field in
Tuesday's primary election.
   ``How he fell in line with the East Coast liberals ... how he's
been canceling out (New Mexico Republican Sen.) Pete Domenici's
vote over 500 times since he's been there,'' Bingaman said.
   Vice President George Bush won his party's presidential primary
and picked up all 26 GOP convention delegates. Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis beat Jesse Jackson in Democratic voting and claimed
16 of 24 delegates.
   With 97 percent, or 1,270 of 1,307 precincts reporting,
Valentine had 33,672 votes, or 42.9 percent, while former U.S.
Interior Department official Rick Montoya had 22,37314 votes, or

   ``We've done it before in New Mexico and we'll do that again
this year,'' said Bingaman, who beat incumbent GOP Sen. Harrison
``Jack'' Schmitt six years ago and was unopposed this year.
   Bingaman said he believed there would be three main issues in
the general election campaign _ the economy, education and
disadvantaged children.

<HEAD>U.S. Reassures Security Support For Olympics Against North</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci today
accused North Korea of trying to disrupt the Olympic Games and said
the United States would beef up its military forces to stop any
threat.
   ``Let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure
the security of the 1988 Summer Olympics Games,'' he said.
   Communist North Korea continues to threaten peace on the divided
Korean peninsula by refusing to work with South Korea to defuse the
tension, Carlucci said.
   ``It is most unfortunate that the north continues its
trouble-making role and remains unwilling to make the simple
concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the
peninsula,'' he said.
   Carlucci gave the assurance to South Korean defense officials at
the start of the 20th annual U.S.-South Korea security conference
to discuss mutual defense.
   South Korea Defense Minister Oh Ja-bok also stressed the North
Korean threat to the south and said the Olympics was adding to the
tension.
   ``With the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming Olympics
remaining undiminished, military tension between south and north on
the peninsla continues, thus posing a grave threat to the stability
of Northeast Asia,'' he said.
   U.S. and South Korean delegates agreed during the talks to build
up their early warning systems to detect any possible North Korean
military threat. Up to three U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will help
provide security for the Games, officials said.
   North Korea is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The
International Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the
demand, saying the Games are awarded to a single city.
   The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter opponents that
have clashed repeatedly. The United States has about 42,000 U.S.
troops based in the south under a mutual defense pact.
   After meeting with Oh, Carlucci had lunch with President Roh
Tae-woo and was awarded the Order of National Security. His
scheduled visits later in the day with frontline American and South
Korean troops were canceled due to bad weather, officials said.

<HEAD>First Times Beach Dioxin Lawsuit Goes Against Former Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has ruled that 10 former residents of
Times Beach, a town destroyed by toxic waste contamination, had not
been harmed by contact with dioxin-laced oil used to spray roads in
the early 1970s.
   The Circuit Court jury deliberated a day before returning a
verdict Tuesday in favor of Independent Petrochemical Corp. of St.
Louis and the now-defunct Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical
Co. of Verona.
   The companies, along with Syntex USA and Syntex Agribusiness of
Palo Alto, Calif., had been sued by former Times Beach residents in
an attempt to recover damages for health problems they said were
caused by their exposure to dioxin.
   Syntex pulled out of the case without explanation last week. A
source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Syntex had
settled out of court for $14 million to be divided among 1,230
claims in Missouri.
   Lawyers for Syntex declined to confirm or deny Tuesday that a
settlement had been reached.
   The eight cases in the trial, involving 10 people, were chosen
by Judge Michael J. Hart as test cases from among 184 claims filed
by former Times Beach residents.
   The trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneys on
both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short a
time as possible, Hart said.
   Edwin L. Noel, an attorney for Syntex, said he hoped the jury's
verdict would set a precedent for dioxin claims.
   ``I think this will serve as a bellwether for those cases,'' he
said. The verdict validated defense arguments that ``this level of
exposure (to dioxin) is not cause for alarm,'' he said.
   Ted Perryman, who represented Northeastern Pharmaceutical, said
the verdict ``was a response to the medical case that we put on.
The jury simply believed that these people weren't injured by
dioxin.''
   Jurors interviewed after the verdict agreed with that assessment.
   ``The bottom line was that, over the last seven months, there
was no evidence to indicate health damage,'' said juror Alvia
Chambers, 43. She said the jury believed that complaints cited by
the plaintiffs, such as headaches and heart problems, had not been
conclusively linked to dioxin.
   Sources close to the case, which began in November, said more
than 2,200 claims of harmful dioxin exposure were still pending.
Those claims arose from exposure to dioxin in Times Beach and other
sites.
   Dioxin is a toxic byproduct of the manufacture of herbicides and
other chlorine compounds. It has been linked to cancer in animals
and in humans and has been associated with liver and immune system
disorders and a serious skin condition called chloracne.
   In 1982, the Environmental Protection Agency bought out homes
and property in Times Beach because of dioxin contamination caused
when waste oil tainted with the chemical was sprayed on streets and
other areas to control dust in the early 1970s.
   Times Beach officially ceased to exist in 1985 when its alderman
voted to disincorporate the town of 2,240 residents.
   Donald L. Schlapprizi, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he
was disappointed by the verdict.
   ``It's depressing that with all of the effort ... you go down in
flames,'' he said.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs were planning a strategy to deal
with Tuesday's defeat, which could include a request for a new
trial.
   The dioxin that contaminated Times Beach was produced by Syntex
at a plant in Verona in southwestern Missouri. Syntex later
transferred to Northeastern Pharmaceutical tanks that reportedly
contained the dioxin-laced waste.
   Northeastern contracted with International Petrochemical for
removal of the waste oil. International then contracted with a
waste hauler to truck the oil from Verona. The hauler later mixed
the waste with other waste oil and sprayed it on unpaved roads to
control dust.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is discussing working with
American and other foreign interests to develop vast natural gas
fields in its Arctic, Siberian and other regions, a top Soviet
official says.
   Joint venture agreements ``are not signed yet but they are in
the works,'' Soviet Gas Industry Minister Victor S. Chernomyrdin
told reporters on Tuesday at the 17th World Gas Conference.
   He declined to give other details or name the potential foreign
partners, saying premature disclosure could upset the negotiations
or ``ruin their business.''
   Earlier Tuesday, the minister said in a speech to the conference
that the 1986 disaster at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl nuclear
power plant has prompted increased use of gas and other fuels to
make electricity.
   Chernobyl ``made it necessary to somewhat limit the production
of electricity at the nuclear power plants,'' and other kinds of
power stations have taken on greater loads, he said.
   Chernobyl and other environmental concerns led to huge increases
in gas production and consumption the past three years in the
Soviet Union, now the world's largest natural gas producer, the
minister said. From 1984 to 1987, he said, Soviet gas production
rose from 584.7 billion to 727.4 billion cubic meters and
consumption from 462.8 billion to 568 billion cubic meters.
   Gas exports have increased more than 20-fold in the past 15
years, he said. Dutch gas industry leader A.H.P. Grotens told the
conference Western Europe nations import 60 billion cubic feet of
Soviet gas annually.
   Chernomyrdin told reporters that terms of joint ventures are
still being negotiated, but that the Soviets will insist on
retaining majority ownership in any project.
   The Soviet Union seeks foreign collaboration to acquire high
technology for vast production increases planned for the 21st
century, the minister said.
   The Soviets face daunting engineering problems in some remote
and frigid egions, he said.
   Six lengthy pipelines will be needed under the normally-frozen
Gulf of Baidarak, for instance, to link the huge Yamal Peninsula on
the Arctic Ocean to the rest of the country, he said. One field on
the tundra peninsula could yield 200 billion cubic meters of
natural gas annually by 1990, he said.

<TEXT>
   Snow fell in California mountains and widely scattered showers
dampened the mid-Atlantic Coast and the Southeast early today after
thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging winds in many areas.
   A heat wave in the Northern Plains was expected to continue.
   Gusts up to 75 mph ripped through Delaware on Tuesday, downing
trees, forcing the evacuation of more than 500 people from a
subdivision and causing power outages, authorities said. At least
31 people were treated for mostly minor storm-related injuries,
Kent General Hospital in Dover reported.
   The heaviest damage appeared to be just north of Dover, where
residents reported a tornado. However, the weather service said the
report could not be confirmed immediately.
   The thunderstorms Tuesday also struck Florida, Alabama,
Maryland, Pennsylvania and Montana. The storms weakened during the
evening, and by early today lingered primarily over southern
Florida and central Iowa.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours that ended at 2 a.m. EDT
included an inch at West Palm Beach, Fla., three-quarters of an
inch at Miami and two-thirds of an inch at Orlando, Fla.
   Snow fell in higher elevations of Northern California early
today. On Tuesday, at least 10 hikers were reported missing
temporarily and some mountain highways were closed or restricted as
snow drifted up to 2{ feet high. Hail up to a half-inch in diameter
fell on Fresno.
   Elsewhere, many cities hit record highs for the date as a heat
wave continued in much of the nation.
   Baltimore reached 94 degrees, topping the 93-degree mark set in
1980; Bismarck, N.D., reached 101, beating the 95-degree record of
1977; Cape Hatteras, N.C., hit 90, a degree more than the 1975
record; Galveston, Texas, reached 91, beating the 89-degree mark of
1880; and Goodland, Kansas, topped out at 97, a degree more than
the 1963 record.
   The nation's high was 110 degrees at Glendive, Mont.
   For today, rainshowers were forecast for northern Maine, and
from central Montana across the northern third of the Pacific
Coast; and showers and thunderstorms in Florida. Sunny skies were
forecast for much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 50s and 60s from the
Great Lakes across New England; in the 60s from the northern half
of the Pacific Coast across Idaho and northern Nevada; the 90s over
eastern Montana, from the Carolinas across Florida, the Gulf of
Mexico states, the Tennessee Valley, the lower half of the
Mississippi Valley, the southern two-thirds of the Plains and the
desert Southwest; and 100 in southwest Texas. Highs elsewhere
generally were expected reach the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33 at
Meacham, Ore., to 82 at Minot, N.D.

<HEAD>Special Politburo Session Calls For Grassroots Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo has called on local Communist
Party committees to submit grassroots proposals to this month's
crucial national party conference, the official Tass news agency
reported today.
   The move apparently aims to sidestep middle-level bureaucrats
who oppose Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ambitious program for economic
and social reform.
   The Soviet leader seeks through reform to limit the power and
privilege of the entrenched bureaucracy.
   The first national Communist Party conference in 47 years, to
begin on June 28, is expected to consolidate political changes
backed by Gorbachev, including limits on terms for party officials.
   The Politburo, in a special Monday meeting, instructed local
party organizations to collect ``incoming proposals from the
grassroots to make sure they will be taken into account when the
conference discusses the issues on its agenda and be reflected in
its decisions,'' Tass said.
   The 13-member ruling body, in a communique carried by Tass, said
most of those suggestions focus on ways of ``continuing to
democratize party and public affairs, and broadening glasnost,''
Gorbachev's term for greater openness on selected topics.
   During the election process for delegates to the 19th Party
Conference, proponents of Gorbachev's reform program charged that
middle-echelon bureaucrats were trying to seat more conservative
party members.
   By ensuring that grassroots proposals make it onto the
conference agenda, the Politburo, which includes Gorbachev and
other top Kremlin leaders, may limit the influence of party
apparatchiks at the session.
   The communique was published two days after the special meeting
of the Politburo, which usually convenes on Thursdays.
   No reason was given for the delay.
   At its Monday session, the Politburo also ``expressed complete
approval for the work done by Mikhail Gorbachev'' during the summit
with President Reagan last week, the statement said.
   Politburo members ``expressed the conviction that the Moscow
talks have augmented possibilites for improving the overall
atmosphere in the Soviet-American relationship and helped foster a
favorable political climate in international relations in general.''

<HEAD>UMW Calls Walkouts In Three States To Protest Rules Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers union ordered one-day walkouts by about
7,000 miners in Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee to protest proposed
changes in federal safety rules that one official says would
``cause big amounts of blood.''
   ``They're going to have more trouble out of us than they ever
thought of before they get this thing through,'' UMW District 19
President Joe Phipps of Middlesboro, Ky., said Tuesday.
   The union called a one-day ``memorial period'' in each state
this week so union members could attend hearings called by the
federal Mine Safety and Health Administration on the rule changes,
which the UMW says would increase fire hazards in underground mines.
   One of the most controversial changes proposed by agency would
eliminate the requirement that mines be evacuated when ventilation
fans stop operating.
   Another proposal would allow mine operators to let conveyor belt
passageways double as ventilation tunnels. Regulations now require
that the two be separated to reduce the chances of fire.
   Special ventilation processes are needed in underground mines to
disperse methane, an explosive gas found in coal seams that
accumulates as the coal is mined.
   ``It's like wearing a plastic bag over your head and carrying a
stick of dynamite in your back pocket with a 3-foot fuse on it,''
said miner Morgan Bayless of Tackett Creek, Tenn. ``That's the
position we're in.''
   ``If this goes into effect, it's going to cause big amounts of
blood,'' Phipps said.
   Kentucky and Tennessee miners observed their memorial period
Tuesday, when the agency held its hearing in Lexington, Ky. The
memorial period for Alabama miners is scheduled for Thursday, when
the agency will hold a hearing in Birmingham.
   ``(Union) members are justifiably worried about the proposed
changes since the agency has failed to address needed improvement
in federal mine safety standards,'' UMW President Richard Trumka
said Tuesday.
   Trumka also indicated that the union will consider calling
additional memorial periods on a case-by-case basis to coincide
with hearings in Indiana, Colorado and West Virginia later this
month.
   The agency says the revisions, developed by the safety
committees of three coal industry organizations representing the
operators, would update, clarify and simplify its ventilation
standards.
   But Joe Main, the UMW's safety director, said the proposed rule
changes ``save the mine operators over $7 million annually at the
loss of safety protection for miners.''

   Former two-term Gov. Thomas Judge beat five
Democratic rivals to win his party's nomination for governor, and
Democratic Sen. John Melcher's bid for a third term is opposed by
Gordon Burns, a Republican county commissioner.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' Judge said after
Tuesday's victory. ``While they remember the past, they also wanted
to know our plans for the future. ... We put forth a program that
the people of this state have been waiting for.''
   In the presidential primary contest, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis easily beat Jesse Jackson for 19 Democratic delegates while
Vice President George Bush walked away in the Republican contest.
   Judge will face Republican Stan Stephens in November in his run
for the office he held eight years until his ouster by his own
lieutenant governor in the 1980 Democratic primary. Two-term Gov.
Ted Schwinden is retiring.
   Melcher quashed a token challenge from Billings lawyer Robert
Kelleher; Burns, a county commissioner from Billings, beat Thomas
Faranda, a Minnesotan who quit an absentee race though his name
stayed on the GOP ballot.
   Stephens, a former state senator from Havre who edged Rep. Cal
Winslow for the GOP nomination, says memories also may hurt Judge.
He said the former governor ``represents an administration from
yesteryear.''
   With 977 of 982 precincts reporting, or 99 percent, Judge had
46,274 votes, or 39 percent.
   Former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr. had 31,868 votes
or 27 percent, and Attorney General Mike Greely had 26,742 votes or
23 percent.
   State Sen. Ted Neuman got 6 percent of the vote; Martin ``Red''
Beckman, a tax protester, got 3 percent and Emmett ``Curly''
Thornton, an ex-drug addict turned evangelist, took 2 percent.
   In the Republican gubernatorial race, with 99 percent of
precincts reporting, Stephens had 43,684 votes or 50 percent to
Winslow's 37,585 votes or 43 percent.
   In the Democratic Senate primary, with 977 of 982 precincts
reporting, or 99 percent, Melcher had 87,498 votes or 75 percent,
compared with 29,766 votes or 25 percent for Kelleher.
   On the Republican side, Burns, a county commissioner from
Billings, defeated Thomas Faranda, a Minnesotan who filed for the
GOP nomination but gave up his absentee quest in April, tough his
name remained on the ballot.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Burns had 63,007 votes
or 85 percent, compared with 11,419 votes, or 15 percent, for
Faranda.
   Melcher said the difference between him and Burns is experience.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' Melcher
said in a telephone interview from his suburban Washington, D.C.,
home. ``He's going to try and say that's a disadvantage, but I
don't really think it is.
   ``The longer you're here, the more chances you have to get bills
passed ... that will benefit Montana,'' Melcher said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Elderly Have Better Access to Medical Care Than
Working Aged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health care is less accessible to adults of
working age, especially if they are poor, than for the elderly, a
study has found.
   Even reasonably well-off adults who are young or middle-age are
less likely than older people to get medical care when they need it.
   ``Our findings suggest that, whatever problems of access the
elderly now face, access to health care is markedly worse for
working-age adults,'' the researchers concluded.
   They said this finding ``has major implications for national
health policy, since by general agreement medical insurance
coverage for the elderly has been seriously deficient.''
   The study, based on a 1986 nationwide telephone survey of 7,633
people, was directed by Dr. Rodney A. Hayward of the University of
California, Los Angeles. It is being published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   The survey found that insured working-age adults were nearly
four times as likely as the elderly to need medical services but
not receive them. And they were more than three times as likely to
have major financial difficulties because of illness.
   Among the insured working-age people, those who were poor were
four times as likely as better-off people to have unfulfilled
medical needs. Such problems also were more common among blacks and
Hispanics than among whites.
   ``Our findings suggest that neither the Medicaid program nor the
reported physician surplus has solved the problem of access to
medical care for the poor and minorities,'' the researchers wrote.
   They said several factors may account for inadequate medical
care of the working poor. Among them:
   _ Co-payments, deductibles and other insurance restrictions may
deter poor people from seeking care.
   _ Some doctors may be unwilling to take care of people with
Medicaid coverage because the fees they receive are lower.
   _ Medical facilities may be scarce where they live, or they have
trouble getting to the doctor.
   _ Some people may be unwilling to seek care, even when they need
it.
   _ Some may avoid clinics and hospitals because of discrimination
or ``bureaucratically unfriendly environments.''

<HEAD>Elvis Presley Jewelry Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jewel-encrusted brooch depicting bees was one
of the whimsical gifts from Elvis Presley to a former girlfriend
that was auctioned.
   The 31 pieces of jewelry, which included lavish gold pendants,
rings and bracelets made of diamonds, emeralds or opals, fetched a
total $82,000 Tuesday, surpassing the presale estimate of $50,000.
   Many pieces sold for two to 10 times the estimate, said Robin
Ahrens, spokeswoman for Christie's, the auctioneer.
   An unidentified lawyer from Tuscaloosa, Ala., purchased nine
items for $28,000, including a 22-carat opal and diamond ring that
sold for $4,400.
   The ring was a gift from Presley to the unidentified woman in
1974. The entertainer believed opals possessed a magical quality,
said Mrs. Ahrens.
   The lawyer also spent $2,750 on a classic 1972 diamond pin
spelling the word ``Love,'' which was a Christmas gift.
   Two top lots that both sold for $5,270 were a black onyx,
diamond and gold choker and the bee brooch made of diamonds, rubies
and yellow gold. Both items were expected to bring in between
$2,000 and $2,500.
   Presley had presented the bee brooch as a ``whimsical gift,''
said Mrs. Ahrens.
   Bidders came from across the country as well as Europe and Asia.
   The Presley items were part of an ``important jewels'' auction
that brought a total of $5,169,527 for 355 lots. Prices included a
10 percent buyer's premium.

Massachusetts man picked up for $15 in a New Hampshire barn was
auctioned for $198,000, putting the seller in a ``dream world,'' an
auction house official said.
   The first-edition copy of ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' only
the 12th known copy of Poe's first book published in 1827, was sold
at Sotheby's auction house Tuesday to a rare book dealer for less
than expected.
   Even so, the Massachusetts seller was `extremely happy,''
Sotheby's Vice President David Redden said. ``He's still in, I
think, a sort of dream world over the whole business.''
   The seller, who demanded anonymity said he found the book in an
antique barn in southern New Hampshire. The barn was not identified.
   Poe, who paid to have the book published by an obscure Boston
publisher, went on to write such classic poems and stories of
horror and romance as ``Annabel Lee,'' ``The Raven,'' and ``The
Tell-tale Heart.''
   ``It's the rarest book in American literature _ it's the most
famous book in American literature,'' said the buyer, Manhattan
book dealer James Cummins. ``It's the book that every rare book
seller hopes to get his hands on.''
   Cummins said he was buying the book for a ``serious book
collector'' from New York and was ``very pleased'' with the price,
which Sotheby's described as a record for a work of American
literature.
   Sotheby's had estimated the book's value at $200,000 to
$300,000. The $198,000 price includes the 10 percent commission
that goes to Sotheby's.
   The soft-cover book, which contains the long title poem and nine
shorter ones, bears no reference to Poe, listing the author only as
``a Bostonian.'' Although Poe was born in Boston, he lived there
only a few months before his parents moved to Richmond, Va. He
lived in Boston again for about eight weeks when ``Tamerlane'' was
published.
   The work had been written about five years earlier, when Poe was
12 or 13 years old. There is no indication that a single copy of
the book was ever sold, and it never has been highly regarded by
critics.
   Its value is considered historical more than literary, since it
is the first and rarest work by Poe.
   Of the 11 other known copies of ``Tamerlane,'' all but one are
owned by libraries or other institutions. The only other one in
private hands is on loan to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.
   Also sold Tuesday were four handwritten notebooks by Nobel
laureate Saul Bellow that comprised the rough draft of his 1970
novel, ``Mr. Sammler's Planet.''
   The notebooks, believed to be the first archive of a major
living author's published work to be auctioned during his life,
brought $66,000.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Chicago's ``Worst'' Schools Best Place to Try Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's schools could point the way for others
to improve, says Education Secretary William Bennett, who has
called the city's school system America's worst.
   However, Bennett said Tuesday that his view hadn't changed much
from November, when he called the city's public schools an
``education meltdown.''
   ``If it's not the worst, it's too ... close to the worst,''
Bennett told reporters after a speech before the Chicago Council on
Foreign Relations.
   Although he said the city's educational system was ``sad'' and
``very destructive,'' Bennett expressed optimism about the future.
   ``There are radical proposals in the air. This may be a
revolutionary time,'' said Bennett, who reiterated his support for
a tuition voucher plan.
   Under the plan, a school system would issue a voucher to parents
for each child, and the parents could then choose a public or a
private school. The schools would redeem vouchers for government
money.
   Bennett said the system, which is aimed at encouraging
competition among schools, has not been tried on a large scale in
the United States. He predicted that if a major test comes, it
would be in Milwaukee or Chicago.
   ``If you tried it, tried it honestly and fairly, I would predict
it would improve things dramatically,'' he added.
   Whatever comes out of efforts to improve Chicago's
430,000-student system, ``may be able to point the way for other
school systems in the country,'' Bennett said.
   City schools Superintendent Manford Byrd Jr. called the plan
``just a diversion from funding the public school system the way it
should be funded.''
   ``It is intended to deny students now in the system, who tend to
be minority and poor, the type of funding they need to be served,''
Byrd said. ``I think (Bennett's) bashing of the public school
system was only intended to make the climate right for the
destruction of the system.''
   Bennett also called for redistributing power to give parents and
principals more say over school policies like curriculum and
personnel.
   He labeled the Chicago school burueaucracy ``the blob,'' and
accused teacher unions of blocking reform in a system plagued by
low test scores and high dropout rates.
   Statistics show nearly 45 percent of students who began school
with the class of 1985 dropped out before graduating. State figures
also show that half of Chicago's public high schools ranked in the
bottom 1 percent of U.S. schools for student scores on the American
College Test.
   Bennett called any reform that didn't redistribute power
``nonsense,'' and said unions interested only in ``getting more and
more for everyone'' may be hurt in the short run. But positive
changes in schools would help unions in the long run by raising the
professional esteem of teachers, he said.
   Bennett visited two Chicago schools in March at the request of
Chicago Teachers Union. He said afterward that ``intransigence of
special interests'' such as unions remain the biggest obstacle to
reform.
   Jacqueline Vaughn, president of the Chicago union, said then
that cutbacks in government funds were the real culprits.

<HEAD>Soviet Journal Takes On Lenin in Unusual Glasnost-Era Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin misguidedly approved
the use of terror and was also wrong to abolish all private
property and create a system of forced labor camps, a Soviet
literary journal says.
   Such criticism would have been forbidden before the era of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness, ushered in by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Still, the overall tone of the article in the monthly Novy Mir
is moderate, and it concludes that Lenin made the mistakes early
on, realized he was wrong and deserves praise.
   Vassily Selyunin, the author of the 30-page article, said that
in the first few years after the Bolsheviks took power in 1917,
Lenin favored overly harsh measures for putting the country's
economy back on track.
   Selyunin wrote in the May edition of Novy Mir that Lenin
considered using violent means to shore up the economy, as was done
in the French Revolution.
   In November 1917, Lenin declared that ``speculators'' were
``enemies of the people'' who should be shot when found, according
to Selyunin. Speculation then meant anything outside government
trade.
   Lenin also advocated another harsh measure, limiting peasant
families to only the bread they needed to make it to the next
harvest, Selyunin wrote. The penalty for violation was a minimum
10-year jail term.
   The author says Lenin might be excused for some of the harsh
measures because the country was suffering severe hunger and
destruction. But the measures actually exacerbated the problems,
Selyunin wrote.
   In January 1918, Lenin supported a decree that increased the
space for prisoners so that ``class enemies'' could be
incarcerated. Shortly thereafter, a system of labor camps was set
up, and many people accused of economic crimes were imprisoned
there, Selyunin wrote.
   The article says the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix
A. Dzerzhinksy, also justified the use of labor camps.
   ``The need for self-defense was so great that we consciously
could close our eyes to a series of mistakes, if only to preserve
the republic,'' it says.
   The criticism of Dzerzhinsky also was unusual for the Soviet
press, which generally extolls him as a hero who helped defend the
country.
   Selyunin implied that Lenin sowed the seeds for the extreme
abuses of power for which his successor, Josef Stalin, has been
condemned.
   Gorbachev has encouraged historians to take a more honest look
at the country's past. The result has been numerous press articles,
books and films abhoring Stalin, who sent millions of people to
their death through purges, forced collectivization of agriculture
and other repressions.
   Gorbachev has sharply criticized Stalin's economic policies,
under which the central government tightly controlled production of
goods and services, allowing for little individual initiative.
   The criticism has extended to the ``era of stagnation'' under
Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was Communist Party chief from 1964 to 1982.
   But criticism of Lenin has been off-limits. He is still
generally portrayed as a far-sighted genius of unsurpassed wisdom.
   The Novy Mir article took advantage of glasnost to break new
ground in criticizing Lenin:
   ``The extremes of force, as we see, spread boundlessly: first it
is undertaken for repression of opponents of the revolution, then
it is turned against potential enemies (the Red Terror) and finally
it becomes a means for solving purely economic tasks,'' Selyunin
wrote.
   But Selunin said Lenin began to realize he was wrong, and he
quotes the leader as saying the use of force was backfiring,
increasing civil unrest.
   In March 1921, Lenin made a mid-course correction and did away
with a severe tax on peasants. Two months later, he launched his
New Economic Policy, which allowed greater freedom in agriculture,
industry and trade.
   Selyunin credits Lenin's flexibility and the new policy with
helping rid the country of bureaucracy, which Gorbachev has said is
stifling some of his reforms.

   Composer Leonard Bernstein, speaking in
fractured Hebrew, accepted a scroll naming him Laureate Conductor
of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
   ``Thank you very much, both members of the orchestra and
non-members of the orchestra. This is the biggest honor of my
life,'' Bernstein said Tuesday night in Hebrew after ex-Foreign
Minister Abba Eban chided him for not learning the language.
   Eban recalled that the white-haired, 70-year-old maestro
directed the orchestra in the newly captured town of Beersheba
during the war of independence in 1948.
   He returned frequently to conduct concerts, including the first
staged after the Six-Day war in 1967.
   ``He was the herald and messenger of all our great occasions,''
Eban said.

<TEXT>
   A 70-year-old Alzheimer's disease victim
was returned to her home after she was found by rescuers who had
searched for her the past seven days.
   Mary Margaret Rinkert was found near Liberty Reservoir, less
than a half mile away from Oakland Manor, the care center she had
walked away from on May 31.
   She left with only her clothes _ a navy blue skirt, blouse, navy
blue blazer, white knitted hat and pink slippers. When she was
found, Tuesday morning, she was barefoot, with cuts and bruises on
her legs and feet. Her jacket had been rolled up to cushion her
head. She was dehydrated, but she endured several nights of
temperatures in the 40s.
   ``It was an incredible moment,'' said Kathy Ash of Catonsville,
the woman's daughter and one of the first people to reach her.
``She was staring up at the sky. She was shaking badly. I just felt
that if she was tough enough to have lasted that long, she would
pull it off.''
   Mrs. Rinkert was resting Tuesday night at the Baltimore County
General Hospital in Randallstown. Mrs. Ash hopes that once her
mother is discharged she can return to Oakland Manor.

<TEXT>
   Excavation workers unearthed gold, silver,
precious stones and other valuables buried inside the Kremlin walls
about 750 years ago, a weekly newspaper reported today.
   The buried treasure included pendants, rings, necklaces,
pendants and Slavonic decorations from the period, the Moscow News
reported.
   It said the riches were buried by defenders of the Kremlin to
protect the goods against the Mongolian invasion of 1237. They were
found on the Kremlin's Borovitsky Hill, which overlooks the Moscow
River.
   The Mongols controlled the Slavic regions of present-day Soviet
Union until the 14th century, exacting high taxes, conscripting the
male poulation and harshly repressing revolts.
   Moscow News said the value of the treasure had not yet been
assessed.

<HEAD>Security Forces On Alert To Stop March To North Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government began deploying 60,000
riot police today to stop radical students marching to communist
North Korea. In Seoul, troopers firing tear gas broke up a rally.
   National Police Headquarters said tens of thousands of riot
police would block roads to the North Korean border to prevent the
march Friday. Riot police began surrounding colleges today in Seoul
as security forces went on top alert.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets
fired volleys of tear gas when several hundred students at Yonsei
University tried to march into the street after a rally for the
march.
   A few students hurled rocks and a handful of firebombs, but the
marchers were quickly driven back into the campus by the 4,000 riot
police surrounding the school.
   Students yelling anti-American slogans staged a rally at nearby
Mongji University to prepare for the march. Speakers denounced the
United States, claiming it enforces partition of the peninsula.
   ``Drive out Yankees who enforce the partition of our land,''
students shouted as they shot clenched fists into the air.
   Hundreds of riot police surrounded the school and plainclothes
police officers chased students trying to reach the campus for the
rally.
   Radical leaders have called for up to 40,000 students to rally
at Yonsei Thursday for an overnight vigil before the 30-mile march
to the border north of Seoul. Radicals deny they are pro-North
Korean, but insist on immediate reunification of the Korean people.
   Police said today the school would be completely surrounded to
stop the march. They also warned that campuses would be raided to
detain radical leaders before the march.
   Riot police also stepped up security around government buildings
and U.S. diplomatic facilities in case of student attacks if the
march is blocked. Hundreds of riot police guarded the U.S. Embassy.
   Yonsei University officials were considering installing nets to
stop students committing suicide by jumping off buildings. Some
students have threatened to kill themselves if the march is
blocked. There have been three anti-government protest suicides
since May 15.
   Radical students plan to march to the border truce site of
Panmunjom to meet with North Korean students and clear the way for
reunification of the peninsula, divided since 1945.
   The government has banned the march as a threat to national
security. Government officials say the radicals will play into the
hands of the communist north.
   President Roh Tae-woo met with top officials today to review
plans to stop the march, but no details were released. Unification
Minister Lee Hong-koo, in a meeting with student leaders, refused
to reconsider the ban on the march.
   Opposition leaders called on the students today to call off
plans for the march, saying it lacked national support. They urged
students and government officials to hold talks.
   ``There is no mature consensus on national reunfication,''
opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil
said in a statement after meeting.
   Many South Koreans oppose the students, though most people
support reunification of the peninsula. But most people in the
south fear the hostile north is determined to conquer the whole
peninsula.
   The two Koreas are bitter foes and the north has often attacked
the south. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to trigger the
Korean War.

   The Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading
company, has been selected to represent General Dynamics in plans
to develop a Japanese jet fighter, the company said today.
   General Dynamics manufactures the F-16 Eagle jet fighter, on
which the new Japanese plane, called the FSX, is to be based.
   Mitsubishi will handle sales in Japan of any components or
technology developed by General Dynamics in the FSX project, said a
company official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We look forward to working with Mitsubishi Corp. on this
exciting new project,'' said Vernon A. Lee, General Dynamics' FSX
program director, in a statement.
   ``We are also very appreciative of the interest that was shown
by other highly qualified Japanese companies relative to providing
representation for the FSX program,'' he said.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci reached agreement in Tokyo
last week with Japanese defense officials on joint U.S.-Japanese
production of the new-generation fighter, with 35-45 percent of the
work to be conducted by the U.S. side. The Japanese side is to bear
the estimated $1.32 billion development costs.
   The private sector on the U.S. side will develop the engine,
while the Japanese will develop the new plane's radar system.
Private contractors have not been formally named, but since the FSX
will be based on the F-16, General Dynamics is likely to play a
major role.

<TEXT>
   Russell Harty, a writer and broadcaster
who became one of Britain's top television talk-show hosts, died
early today, a hospital said. He was 54.
   Harty, who suffered from liver failure caused by hepatitis,
underwent surgery for internal bleeding when his condition
deteriorated over the weekend, said a statement from St. James
University Hospital.
   He underwent further surgery overnight and died at 4:30 a.m. in
the operating room, the statement said.
   Harty was rushed unconscious to the hospital in this northern
England city on May 3. He regained consciousness after five days in
a grade four coma, the deepest known, but remained in critical
condition.
   Harty immediately asked doctors to express his thanks to
thousands of his fans who had inundated the hospital with get-well
cards and messages of concern.
   Published reports said Harty apparently contracted hepatitis, an
inflammation of the liver, while making a television series on a
tour of Europe earlier this year. He was treated for hepatitis in
early April and discharged to convalesce.
   The former English and drama schoolteacher had a lugubrious and
disarming manner on television. His interview subjects ranged from
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to rock stars. American rock star
Grace Jones once struck him across the head because she thought he
was ignoring her during a TV interview.
   After success as a director and producer, Harty launched his own
hugely successful talk show, ``Russell Harty Plus,'' in 1973.

Seats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 8-10 to UPDATE with results on California
propositions, new vote totals</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters rejected a possible AIDS quarantine in California,
nominated a councilman to become the first black congressman in New
Jersey, and launched a comeback by former Gov. Thomas Judge in
Montana.
   In other results from seven state primaries Tuesday, voters set
the stage for four Senate races:
   California _ Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy piled up 81
percent of the vote against three challengers and will oppose
moderate Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. McCarthy said he would attack
Wilson for a lack of leadership, adding, ``you must speak from your
convictions to people. You don't jump on winning sides.''
   New Jersey _ First-term Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg
trounced two opponents with 77 percent of the vote and will face
GOP newcomer Peter Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes scholar
and Vietnam war hero. Dawkins criticized Lautenberg's opposition to
the death penalty and willingness to support tax increases.
Lautenberg said Dawkins, who recently moved to New Jersey, ``has
demonstrated a lack of knowledge'' about environmental and other
issues of concern to the state's voters.
   Montana _ Democratic Sen. John Melcher won 74 percent of the
vote against a political unknown in his bid for a third term and
will run against Republican Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone County
commissioner. ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here
awhile,'' Melcher said from Washington. ``The longer you're here,
the more chances you have to get bills passed ... that will benefit
Montana.''
   New Mexico _ State Sen. Bill Valentine outpolled three
Republicans for the right to take on first-term Democratic Sen.
Jeff Bingaman. Valentine said Bingaman supported ``big labor, big
government and big spending on the part of Washington'' and had
fallen in line ``with the East Coast liberals.''
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Valentine had 33,620 votes
or 43 percent, and his closest challenger, former Interior
Department official Rick Montoya, had 22,314 votes or 28.5 percent.
   The AIDS measure, backed by extremist Lyndon LaRouche, was one
of a slew of propositions in California. With 100 percent of the
precincts in, it was soundly defeated by 3,604,180 votes or 68
percent to 1,690,973 votes or 32 percent.
   Also rejected were proposals to relax limits on government
spending, and local measures to shut down the Rancho Seco nuclear
power plant and split mammoth San Bernardino County in two.
However, voters approved two state measures to cap campaign
spending.
   In San Diego, Mayor Maureen O'Connor won a full four-year term.
With 38.1 percent of the vote counted, she had 36,179 votes or 58.3
percent, and her closest rival, former Councilman Floyd Morrow, had
21,334 votes or 34.4 percent.
   Newark, N.J., City Councilman Donald Payne defeated a fellow
black councilman, Ralph Grant, to capture the Democratic nomination
for the seat held by Rep. Peter Rodino for 40 years. Payne will be
an overwhelming favorite against Republican Michael Webb, who also
is black.
   ``It gives our delegation the fairness it's been lacking for
many years,'' Payne said of the fact that he stands to become the
state's first black congressman. ``I can speak from a true urban
perspective.''
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Payne had 39,681 votes or
73 percent and Grant had 14,576 votes or 27 percent.
   In Montana, Judge defeated five other Democrats who were enticed
into the race by the retirement of two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' said Judge, who
served from 1973-1981 and was beaten by Schwinden in the 1980
primary. He said he also had ``put forth a program that the people
of this state have been waiting for.''
   The GOP primary victor, former state Sen. Stan Stephens, said
Judge ``represents an administration from yesteryear.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Judge had 45,826 votes
or 39.3 percent, former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison had
31,718 votes or 27.2 percent and Attorney General Mike Greely had
26,497 votes or 22.7 percent.
   Stephens had 43,279 votes or 49.9 percent and state Rep. Cal
Winslow had 37,451 votes or 43.2 percent. The early favorite,
Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane crash in
April, but his name was on the ballot and he had 6,045 votes or 7
percent.
   Here are highlights from the other states that voted:
   ALABAMA _ Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a son-in-law of former
Gov. George C. Wallace, won the Democratic nomination to state
Supreme Court on a slate supported by trial lawyers and opposed by
big business and insurance companies.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters ran in Democratic primaries,
losing all five congressional nominations they sought and nine of
11 state legislative nominations. They won only in two districts
where they were unopposed.
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there
were only 26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats.

<HEAD>Effort to Create Nation's Biggest County Fails at Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters rejected an effort to carve
out a new county in the high desert of Southern California, but
desert dwellers vowed to continue their campaign for political
independence.
   The proposal to split a new Mojave County out of San Bernardino
County was foundering, 67 percent to 33 percent, with 88 percent of
precincts reporting.
   San Bernardino is the nation's biggest county in area, but
Mojave would have claimed that title with 18,160 square miles,
stretching from the edge of Los Angeles' eastern suburbs across the
Mojave Desert to the Arizona border.
   Residents of the area that would be Mojave County favored the
measure, 60 percent to 40 percent. County-wide, however, the vote
was 111,283 against, 54,709 in favor.
   Secessionists saw the vote as vindication of their frequent
complaints that the county government, dominated by representatives
of such rapidly urbanizing communities as San Bernardino, Fontana
and Ontario, doesn't understand their needs.
   ``The message is very clear,'' said Tom Pinard, president of
Mojave County Proponents. ``We don't have the representation. We
pay the taxes and the services aren't coming back.''
   ``If Mojave County can't squeak through this time, it's far from
dead,'' said Bob Sagona, secretary of the pro-county group.
   One-county backers said voters feared that separation would
leave both counties with insufficient tax base to support needed
services.
   The secession required both a simple majority vote of all county
residents, and a simple majority of residents of the region that
would become Mojave.
   Mojave, which would have been the state's first new county in 80
years, would have claimed 90 percent of the land in present-day San
Bernardino County. But with a population of 205,000, it would take
just one-fifth of the present county's residents.
   Left behind would have been the state's second-smallest county,
a narrow strip of the present county with a population of 1.1
million. That area is swelling with the overflow of population from
Los Angeles and beset by smog and a rising crime rate.

<HEAD>2,000 Winegrowers Protest Low Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 winegrowers blocked a main
street in a central Hungarian town to protest low prices, unsold
stocks and state purchases from abroad, newspapers said today.
   The protest Tuesday in Kisokoeroes was the first such
demonstration reported in the communist country.
   The trade union daily Nepszava and government daily Magyar
Hirlap said the winegrowers blocked the street with tractors,
trailers and mobile spraying units.
   The demonstrators dismantled the blockade only after the local
member of the national Parliament, Sandor Csipko, spoke on their
behalf to local and national farm officials, the newspapers said.
   The official MTI news agency quoted unidentified farmers as
saying at least 1 million gallons of unsold wine are stored in the
wine cellars of the fertile central Hungarian plain.
   Unidentified winegrowers were quoted as telling the newspapers
that wine sells at about 25 cents per quart when purchased by state
organizations.
   The farmers reportedly said that production costs are about 50
percent higher, while the wine sells in shops for four to eight
times more than the purchasing price.
   The newspapers said the farmers also protested the reported
purchase of 234,000 gallons of wine from abroad last year.
   MTI said officials from the national agriculture ministry
promised to speed up state purchases of their wines.

<HEAD>Woman Who Doused Herself Near Kremlin Wall Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who doused herself with gasoline and set
herself on on fire by the Kremlin wall died after a difficult life
as an orphan and former mental patient, a newspaper reported today.
   Moscow News, a weekly paper, said Nadezhda Bannaya was burned
over 85 percent of her body and died Monday in a trauma institute.
   Soviet officials had confirmed the fire on Friday.
   The woman, who was 46, moved from city to city, frequently
changing jobs, the newspaper said.
   ``I heard an awful woman's scream,'' militiaman Oleg Zhmirya
told Moscow News, ``and immediately ran to her. On the way another
worker joined me. The woman was already burning.''
   The militiaman and the assistant put the woman on the lawn and
began to stamp out the fire with their jackets and hats during the
incident Friday, the newspaper said. A Kremlin worker brought an
overcoat and put out the flames. The woman was taken to a hospital.
   Maj. Valentin Kirsanov of the Red Square militia detachment told
Moscow News that a can, a pocketbook with a passport and work
record book and notepad with prayers and a letter were found near
the scene.
   Bannaya came from a family of seven whose mother died early. She
was brought up in an orphanage and lived mostly in the Ukraine
moving frequently and working as a maid and a cleaning woman, the
newspaper said.
   A militia lieutenant told The Associated Press on Friday the
reasons for the woman's action were not known. He said the incident
occurred on the cobble esplanade between St. Basil's Cathedral and
the red brick wall surrounding the Kremlin.
   Moscow News has been at the forefront of the Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness on social
issues and its report of this incident was in line with that policy.

<TEXT>
   A ballot proposal that could have led to the
quarantine of AIDS victims went down to overwhelming defeat after
being sponsored for a second time by political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche.
   ``The initiative makes no more sense today than it did two years
ago,'' said Ken Kizer, director of the state Department of Health
Services.
   With 96 percent of 22,718 precincts reporting early today,
3,481,311 voters or 68 percent disapproved Proposition 69, while
1,628,744 or 32 percent approved it.
   LaRouche, however, indicated he would not drop his crusade.
   ``AIDS is not going to go away,'' he said in a statement
released by his press spokeswoman Dana Scanlon, who said LaRouche
made the comments by phone from West Germany. ``If the voters vote
against me, then they're wrong. I'm right, deadly right on this.''
   It was the second time in 18 months that LaRouche's AIDS plan
failed at the ballot box. Proposition 69 was a clone of his
Proposition 64, which in November 1986 was defeated by a slightly
larger margin than Tuesday's vote.
   In contrast to the public controversy over Proposition 64, the
latest measure drew little debate and its defeat was widely
expected.
   If adopted, it would have required health officials to report to
the state health department the names of people with AIDS and those
testing positive for antibodies to the virus.
   The measure also would have added acquired immune deficiency
syndrome to the state's list of communicable diseases, making those
with the disease as well as carriers of the virus subject to
possible quarantine.
   The medical community and public health officials joined with
homosexual and civil rights groups to denounce the proposition.
They said it would force AIDS victims underground and discourage
them from seeking treatment.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. It
is most often spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers or transfusion of infected blood or blood
products.
   As of May 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 63,726 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 35,798, have died, according to the
national Centers for Disease Control.

<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Sikh woman married an
assassin of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in a bizarre ceremony
during which a photograph stood in for the bridegroom, a newspaper
said today.
   The Statesman newspaper said Surinder Kaur was married May 2 to
a photograph of Satwant Singh in a village in Punjab state.
   Singh could not attend the wedding because he is in jail on
death row.
   The marriage rites were performed by a Sikh priest, the
newspaper said, but it was unclear on whether the ceremony had
legal or religious sanction.
   Mrs. Kaur garlanded a photograph of Satwant Singh and carried it
around a fire seven times, the newspaper said. The bride and groom
customarily walk around a fire in orthodox Sikh weddings.
   Singh and Mrs. Kaur had been engaged since 1983.
   In 1984, Singh was assigned to guard the prime minister. On Oct.
31, 1984, he and another Sikh bodyguard shot Mrs. Gandhi in the
garden of her residence in the capital.
   Singh, now 25, was convicted of murder and sentenced to be
hanged by a special court. An appeal is pending before the Supreme
Court.
   The Statesman said Mrs. Kaur went through with the marriage
despite opposition from her parents and Singh's parents.
   ``I tried everything I could do to stop her,'' Mrs. Kaur's
father, Wirsa Singh, was quoted as telling the newspaper, which
said the parents yielded after their daughter threatened to commit
suicide if not allowed to marry.
   Satwant Singh was informed of his marriage two weeks after the
ceremony when his parents visited him at New Delhi's central jail,
the paper said.
   It did not report his reaction.
   ``Whatever happens, I stand by my act of marrying him,'' The
Statesman quoted the bride as saying. ``If unhappiness is to be my
lot, then let it be so.''
   Satwant Singh is one of three people facing the death sentence
for the assassination, apparently carried out in revenge for the
government's decision to storm the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh
shrine, in June 1984.
   At least 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, were killed when
soldiers stormed the temple in 1984. The shrine in Amritsar, 260
miles northwest of New Delhi, was being used as a base by Sikh
militants agitating for an independent homeland.
   Sikhs form just 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are
in a majority in Punjab. Dissident Sikhs claim discrimination by
the Hindus, who form 80 percent of the population.

<HEAD>McCarthy Beats Three To Face Republican Wilson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy easily won the right to
face Republican incumbent Sen. Pete Wilson this fall, while the
state's voters narrowly declined a chance to become the first to
directly order the closing of a nuclear plant.
   California voters on Tuesday also rejected propositions that
could have quarantined AIDS victims, split the nation's largest
county in two and relaxed government spending limits imposed by
California's 1979 tax revolt.
   McCarthy soundly defeated three political unknowns in the
Democratic Senate primary in Tuesday's voting.
   With 100 percent of the 23,596 precincts reporting, McCarthy
amassed 2,303,029 votes or 82 percent. John Hancock Abbott of Santa
Clara had 214,420 votes or 8 percent, Robert Banuelos of Orange had
159,610 votes or 6 percent and Charles Greene of Los Angeles had
142,520 votes or 5 percent.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis swept to an easy victory over Jesse Jackson, netting the
fraction of the state's 314 Democratic delegates he needed to
clinch his party's nomination, while Vice President George Bush won
the state's Republican primary, where 175 delegates were being
awarded.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor coasted to an easy re-election
victory over former City Councilman Floyd Morrow. With all the vote
counted, O'Conner pulled in 124,222 votes or 59.5 percent to
Morrow's 69,974 or 33.5 percent.
   Among a slew of ballot measures Tuesday was a $1 billion bond
measure sponsored by Gov. George Deukmejian to fund highway
construction and improvement. With all precincts reporting, the
proposal barely lost by 2,560,221 no votes to 2,559,394 in favor.
   Another that narrowly lost was Proposition 71, designed to relax
spending limits Californians placed on their state government in a
1979 voter initiative. The measure would have permitted an
estimated $700 million annual increase in state spending, reducing
by an equal amount the funds likely to be earmarked for future tax
rebates.
   With 100 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote total was
2,579,562 against, or 51 percent, to 2,472,003 in favor, or 49
percent.
   Proposition 72, which also would have changed the spending
limit, but with almost exactly the opposite effect, was defeated 38
percent to 61 percent, 3,167,414 votes to 1,980,987. It would have
reduced the limit for most state programs by an estimated $725
million annually by earmarking those funds exclusively for highways.
   A proposal backed by extremist Lyndon LaRouche to declare AIDS a
communicable disease was soundly defeated 3,605,580 to 1,691,300,
or 68 percent to 32 percent.
   The proposition was opposed by the California Medical
Association and the leadership of both major parties. It matched a
measure sponsored by LaRouche's organization that was beaten 2-1 in
1986.
   In Sacramento County, an initiative that sought to close the
troubled Rancho Seco nuclear power plant narrowly lost. With all of
880 precincts reporting, the measure was defeated by 125,768 votes,
or 50.4 percent, to 123,614 votes, or 49.6 percent. If passed, it
would have marked the first time in history that voters directly
ordered closure of a nuclear plant.
   However, a competing measure to continue operating the plant on
a trial basis for an additional 18 months passed by 129,929 votes,
or 51.6 percent, to 121,803 votes, or 48.4 percent.
   A proposal to carve out a new Mojave County from the desert
portions of San Bernardino County, the nation's largest, lost by
111,283 votes, or 67 percent, to 54,709, or 32.9 percent, with 707
of 804 precincts reporting.
   Proposition 68, which would impose contribution limits on
legislative races and create a system of public financing for
candidates who limit spending, was approved by 53 percent,
2,716,341, to 47 percent, 2,425,064.
   A competing proposition to limit contributions in all races and
prohibit public financing was approved by a 58 percent to 42
percent margin, with 3,044,034 votes in favor and 2,206,718 opposed.
   However, since Proposition 73 was favored by a wider margin than
Proposition 68, Proposition 73's provisions would supersede those
of the other.
   Only one congressional incumbent, freshman Republican Ernest
Konnyu of Saratoga, lost his seat. Stanford University Professor
Tom Campbell, a moderate supported by Konnyu's two Republican
predecessors, former Reps. Pete McCloskey and Ed Zschau, won by 58
percent to 42 percent with all the vote counted.
   In two heavily Republican Los Angeles-area congressional
districts in which the incumbents retired, the winners in the GOP
primaries were two former Reagan White House aides who campaigned
with the help of indicted former White House national security aide
Oliver North.
   Former deputy White House counsel Christopher Cox of Santa Ana
was the victor in the 13-candidate 40th District primary, while
former speechwriter Dana Rohrabacher of Los Angeles topped a field
of eight Republicans seeking the 42nd District nomination.
   In the Senate primary, both Wilson and McCarthy concentrated on
fund-raising and laying the groundwork for November.
   Wilson has led McCarthy in fund-raising and the polls, but has
to contend with a political jinx _ no one has been re-elected to
his Senate seat in more than 30 years.

   Jim and Tammy Bakker have set up office a
mile from PTL's Heritage USA headquarters and said they are digging
in to regain control of the failing TV ministry they built before
his downfall in a sex scandal.
   The Bakkers returned to Fort Mill on Tuesday from Gatlinburg,
Tenn. Bakker toured his new office in a shopping center, then went
next door to visit the offices of the Bring Bakker Back
organization.
   Bakker said that he intends to get the ministry back and that he
would fight for Heritage USA, PTL's Christian theme park.
   ``Believe me, no matter what they try to do, there will be legal
battles,'' Bakker told about 60 supporters. ``Anyone who tries to
take, steal or take over Heritage USA, they can be sure that there
will be legal battles.''
   Bakker, who stepped down from the ministry in 1987. He was
accused of paying hush money to former church secretary Jessica
Hahn, with whom he had a sexual dalliance.
   The ministry is in bankruptcy court and is up to $130 million in
debt. A reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of PTL's
assets awaits final approval June 16 by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus
Reynolds in Columbia.
   Bakker said last week he would try to buy PTL piece by piece as
it is liquidated in bankruptcy court.
   George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte, N.C., Knights minor-league
baseball team and the new Charlotte Hornets of the NBA, has
expressed interest in buying Heritage USA and building a baseball
stadium there.

   Israeli authorities today offered protection to
Arab officials in the occupied West Bank after an Israeli-appointed
Arab mayor was stabbed in the heart, apparently by Palestinian
militants.
   The army maintained a curfew on El Bireh and some areas in the
neighboring town of Ramallah as it continued to search for suspects
in the Tuesday stabbing of Hassan Tawil, 74, the El Bireh mayor.
   Tawil was in stable condition, said a doctor at Ramallah
hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Israelis are trying to stop other Arab officials from
quitting under pressure from militants.
   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said the military government would
step up protection for the Arab officials, but it did not specify
what steps would be taken. An army spokesman refused comment.
   A 19-year-old man from the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jebalya
died overnight from wounds he suffered when beaten by Israel
soldiers, Dr. Ahmed Yassih of Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said. The
army confirmed Hussein Jam'a Abu-Jallalah died but said said the
circumstances and cause of death were not clear.
   The death would raise the number of Arabs killed in the
six-month old Palestinian uprising to 202. Two Israelis have also
died in the unrest in lands Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Israel radio today reported the army would prosecute an officer
and two soldiers for excessive use of force in Arura, a village
near Ramallah where two residents said they were buried under a
pile of rocks last month.
   Hanna Atrash, the elected Arab mayor of the West Bank town of
Beit Sahour, said eight soldiers in two jeeps offered to protect
him but he refused when they said he couldn't go anywhere without
them.
   ``I also told them they are hurting me more than they are
helping me,'' he said.
   Atrash was elected mayor in 1976, the last year Israel allowed
free elections in the territories.
   Tawil is one of about a dozen Arab mayors appointed by the
military government to replace Israeli officers who ran the towns
and cities after some mayors were deposed and elections were
banned. The heads of about 85 village councils also are appointed
by the military government.
   A senior military official said army representatives were
meeting with Arab officials to block resignations anticipated after
the stabbing and the appearance of a new underground leaflet
calling on Israeli-appointed officials to resign.
   Many Arab officials have received threats or had their homes
stoned or firebombed in recent weeks, said the official, also
speaking on condition on anonymity.
   But by this morning, ``not one person has resigned,'' said
Olivier Rafowicz, spokesman for the army administration.
   The mayor of the West Bank town of Qalqilya, Rahman Abu Sneineh,
condemned the stabbing and told Israeli army radio that he did not
want any protection because ``God will protect me.''
   Abu Sneineh, who is considered a moderate, said he had no reason
to fear because ``I do not cooperate with the military government,
I only cooperate with the residents of my town.''
   The army said there was no basis for the allegation that
esidents were buried under a pile of rocks in Arura. But the
officer and two soldiers would be tried for using force on suspects
after their arrest and allegedly shooting at the legs of protesters
without justification, Israel radio said.
   In a new leaflet issued Tuesday, the PLO-led United Leadership
of the Uprising called for a general strike Thursday.
   For the first time, underground leaders also called for arson
attacks on farmland, forests and industries inside Israel. The
directive declared June 22 ``a day to burn the enemy's agricultural
and industrial resources.''

   By a slender margin, voters rejected an
opportunity to become the first to approve the shutdown of a
nuclear power plant and decided to give the problem-plagued Rancho
Seco plant another chance.
   After an expensive and hard-fought campaign, area voters Tuesday
narrowly approved a ballot measure sponsored by Rancho Seco
managers to grant an 18-month trial run to the plant, which has one
of the worst performance records in the nation.
   With all precincts reporting from Sacramento County and a
1,000-vote section of Placer County, the unofficial totals were
129,929 votes, or 51.6 percent, in favor of the measure to 121,803
votes, or 48.4 percent, opposed.
   A second initiative that would have shut down Rancho Seco
permanently lost by a slight margin, receiving 123,614 votes or
49.6 percent in favor and 125,768, or 50.4 percent, against.
   The battle of the competing propositions was a victory for the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which operates Rancho Seco
and put the second measure on the ballot, and for the nuclear
industry, which heavily funded a $1.4 million campaign to save the
plant.
   Rancho Seco has operated at an average of only 40 percent of
capacity and has suffered more than 100 outages since it opened in
October 1984.
   ``We're happy that the community has given us an opportunity to
prove ourselves,'' said Dave Crespo of the Rancho Seco Political
Action Committee, a group of plant employees and contractors who
took part in the ballot campaign.
   ``We have a major chore ahead of us to demonstrate in physical
terms that the plant is safe and can operate reliably,'' he said.
   Harold Singer, president of the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, an industry group, noted that no state or local ballot
measure to shut down a nuclear power plant had ever passed.
Nationally, 14 measures to close or block nuclear plants had been
defeated in the last 13 years, he said.
   But opponents of Rancho Seco, who spent $400,000 in their
campaign, said the plant had won only a reprieve and not
vindication.
   ``The voters have placed Rancho Seco on probation, and they may
have only forestalled for a short time the inevitable closing of
the reactor, which is one of the worst in the country,'' said Ken
Bossong of Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader group that supported the
anti-Rancho Seco campaign.
   He said the vote was the closest in U.S. history on a measure to
close a nuclear plant.
   ``The issue is not going to go away,'' said Sacramento Mayor
Anne Rudin, a supporter of the closure proposal. ``People just
don't trust it (Rancho Seco) to work efficiently.''
   Rancho Seco, located 25 miles southeast of the state capital,
has one of the worst performance records in the country, according
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The movement to close the plant gained momentum following a
severe overcooling accident in December 1985 that idled the plant
for 27 months. It was restarted two months ago after a $400 million
overhaul.
   The approved measure provides for a second public vote on
continued operation of Rancho Seco in 18 months, and requires
closure of the plant any time after Dec. 31 if it fails to operate
at more than 50 percent capacity for four consecutive months.

   A man was fined $58 after failing to
persuade a judge that the four frozen corpses in his van qualified
him to use a car pool lane.
   Robert Hanshew, 25, of Westminster, who transports cadavers for
a mortuary transportation service, was stopped March 21 on a
freeway entrance ramp. Only vehicles with at least two people
inside can use the car pool lanes.
   Hanshew told an officer that he believed the bodies in his van
qualified as passengers, but his reasoning wasn't shared Tuesday by
Municipal Judge Richard Stanford Jr., who ruled passengers must be
alive to qualify for life in the fast lane.
   ``He (Hanshew) even said his mother had died a while back and
hoped no one would refer to his mother as cargo,'' said bailiff
Kerry Kowalski.

   Divers searched flooded mine shafts
today for the last four men missing after an explosion killed at
least 47 men, and Christians and Moslems united in grief to pay
respects to the dead.
   The German and Turkish miners died when a powerful methane gas
explosion ripped through the Stolzenbach mine on June 1 in this
town 72 miles northeast of Frankfurt. Six men were rescued after
spending 65 hours trapped 500 feet underground.
   Peter-Carl Ruehland, spokesman for mine owner Preussen Elektra,
said the divers were sent into action today. He said the water was
five feet high in many parts of the mine.
   A total of 57 miners were trapped in the shaft after the
explosion.
   Specially trained dogs also were standing by to aid in the
search, the ZDF television network said. Officials said there was
little chance the four men were still alive, due to high levels of
deadly carbon monoxide.
   In the center of Borken, an estimated 3,000 mourners _ including
Turks and Germans _ filled the local community center for a joint
Christian-Moslem memorial service to the dead. Thirteen Turks were
among those killed in the blast.
   Niyazi Baloglu, the religious affairs counselor for the Turkish
embassy in Bonn, addressed the mourners in Turkish and called the
Turks who died in the blast ``heroes.''
   Tolay Guersel, 24, traveled from his home in Munich to attend
the service. The young man carried with him a picture of his uncle,
Ali Akser Akarsu, one of the Turks killed.
   A Lutheran pastor and a Roman Catholic priest read off the names
of all 47 miners confirmed dead, as well as the names of the four
missing.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Johannes Kapp of nearby Fulda also
celebrated the 75-minute service, in which a small group of miners
played solemn music.
   After the service, West German President Richard von Weizsaecker
talked to survivors' families, sitting in the front row.
   Town officials say $900,000 already has been collected to aid
the families of the victims.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, fresh from a
nomination-clinching four-state primary sweep, said today neither
Jesse Jackson nor anyone else ``is due an offer'' to join him on
the Democratic ticket.
   Dukakis, who locked up the Democratic presidential nomination
with a four-primary sweep Tuesday, said he will review the possible
candidates within the next few days.
   Asked if Jackson, his closest opponent in the primaries,
deserved to be choice, Dukakis said, ``I don't think anyone is due
an offer.''
   ``But there are a great many people that are going to be
considered and he'll be one of them and I'm not going to rule
anybody in or out at this point,'' he said in an interview taped
earlier on ABC-TV.
   Jackson, interviewed on the same program, said, ``Consideration
does mean an offer; it does not mean just in passing. We have
earned consideration.''
   Today, following the final primary contests, Dukakis held a
majority of nominating delegates. His victory in the fight for the
nomination comes just under four months after his triumph in New
Hampshire set him on the winner's path.
   Jackson, the last of six rivals still contesting him in a race
where the suspense was long since spent, was beaten in each of the
four states holding primaries Tuesday _ New Jersey, New Mexico,
Montana and California.
   The Massachusetts governor was heading home today, stopping
along the way in St. Louis to receive the public endorsement of one
of those fallen rivals, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, and
another former foe was doing the same in Washington, Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill.
   Another former rival, Bruce Babbitt, said he too would bestow
his blessing today. ``I'll call him in the morning and tell him,''
the former Arizona governor said Tuesday night in San Francisco, as
Dukakis was scoring a lopsided victory in California.
   Dukakis staged a victory rally at the elegant ballroom of the
Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
   ``My friends, California has put us over the top,'' Dukakis
said. ``Now the coast-to-coast marathon has reached the Pacific,
and tomorrow the race to the finish line begins.''
   In a thematic victory speech, Dukakis savored his new position
as the party's nominee-to-be.
   ``My friends, what a golden opportunity this is for us,'' he
said of the nomination. ``And what quicksand for our opponents if
they waste this opportunity on mudslinging and name-calling.''
   Dukakis made little mention of Jackson and the uncertainty over
Jackson's intentions at the convention in Atlanta in July, where he
has threatened to lead a floor fight over South Africa policy.
   Jackson, speaking hours later, was conciliatory, saying: ``I
salute him for a fine campaign.''
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis had contended he saw no real
divisions within the party he will lead. But at the same time he
acknowledged he may have disputes with Jackson over the platform.
   ``We may have a floor fight or two,'' Dukakis said. ``There may
be some issues that go to the floor. I don't see any great
divisions within our party. We're going to have ourselves a great
convention.''
   As he had done across California in the final few days, Dukakis
recalled the start of his campaign nearly a year and a half ago
with an exploratory trip into Iowa in February 1987 _ a full year
before that state led off the 1988 delegate season.
   ``Fifteen months ago, in the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire, we
began our marathon run,'' he said. ``Along the way, our Democratic
rivals brought passion and substance to the competition, and I want
to pay special tribute to all of them.''
   Dukakis won his way to the nomination with a steady, methodical
_ some said plodding _ manner that proved successful despite
critics who said he needed more passion.
   Dukakis finished third in Iowa's first caucuses and rebounded to
win the primary in next-door New Hampshire.
   On Super Tuesday, the big regional primary in early March,
Dukakis did well enough. He surrounded the South by winning in New
England, Maryland, Florida and Texas _ the last two the biggest
prizes of that day and where he won without majorities.
   He stumbled with a third place finish in Illinois the next week
and was stunned by a two-to-one loss days later in Michigan's
caucuses.
   The twin setbacks raised questions about his abilities as a
campaigner, but Dukakis remained calm and changed his speeches but
not his style or tone.
   He rebounded in Wisconsin, and by the time New York's returns
were counted in mid-April, there was little doubt who would be the
Democratic nominee.

   Those convicted of first-time drug possession in
Judge Ted Poe's court will get probation with a twist: their cars
must bear a bumper sticker reading ``Texas _ Don't Mess With
Drugs.''
   ``It's not going to move mountains, but it's just another way of
communicating that drugs are harmful,'' the state judge said Monday.
   Before instituting the policy, Poe's probation requirements
usually included regular urinalysis and drug treatment.
   The decals are a toned-down version of those many people
convicted of drunken driving must have on their cars warning
motorists that the driver is a felon and advising them to report
erratic driving to police.
   So far, the judge has given the stickers to six offenders. He
offers probation to first-time, non-violent offenders only, and not
to drug dealers.
   ``The only place (a dealer) is going to be able to put a bumper
sticker is on his tractor up at the penitentiary,'' Poe said.
   Poe is known for his creative probation requirements. Some
people placed on probation in his court worked on the restoration
of the battleship Texas, and a drunken driver had to erect a cross
where he killed the victim.
   ``The old paths are not the proven paths,'' Poe said of his
unorthodox ways.

   An alleged Japanese terrorist who authorities say
may have been involved in plotting attacks on the Olympic Games in
Seoul arrived today to heavy police guard after being deported from
the Philippines.
   About 100 police officers met the Japan Air Lines plane carrying
Hiroshi Sensui as it arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport, the Tokyo
Broadcasting Service said.
   The NPA official said police would start interrogating Sensui,
51, at Metropolitan Police headquarters tonight. The official spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Sensui was arrested Tuesday at a suburban Manila hotel and
hustled aboard a Japan Air Lines jet bound for Tokyo today.
   Officials said Sensui was a member of the leftist Japanese Red
Army and had been sought since 1977, when he was released from
prison in exchange for hostages aboard a JAL plane the terrorist
group had hijacked in Bangladesh.
   In Manila, Mirian Defensor-Santiago, the Philippine immigration
commissioner, told reporters Sensui had undergone plastic surgery
at the hospital where he was arrested and had to be identified by
fingerprints.
   She said the man had been living in the Philippines for several
years under the name Hiroshi Yamaguchi and had denied he was Sensui.
   Mrs. Defensor-Santiago said there were ``preliminary reports''
from regional security officials that ``the terrorists have
initiated activity expected to culminate in the Olympic Games.''
   She said evidence indicated the Japanese Red Army had planned to
use Manila as a base for operations during the Summer Olympic
Games, which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   Western intelligence sources suspect the North Koreans may be
plotting to disrupt the games using Japanese and other
international terrorists.
   The Japanese Red Army, active during the 1960s and early 1970s,
has re-emerged as a terrorist force.
   In April, a bomb attack linked to the Red Army gutted a U.S.
military club in Naples, Italy. That same month, a Japanese man
suspected of being a Red Army member was arrested in New Jersey in
possession of explosives.
   ``There are reasonable grounds for believing there are a number
of his (Sensui's) colleagues remaining in the country,'' Mrs.
Defensor-Santiago said. ``We are redoubling our efforts so we can
make similar arrests.''
   Police had been searching for Sensui since he disappeared last
November from a Manila hotel where he had been under surveillance.
   Sensui was serving a prison term in Japan for murder and robbery
but was released in the hijack exchange.
   Japanese and Filipino officials said Sensui was the Red Army's
chief representative in the Philippines, where he was establishing
a base for operations throughout East Asia.

   Lawyers from the International Bar Association who
met with Soviet lawyers and officials said today they found little
evidence of new Soviet thinking on Jewish emigration.
   ``What I have come away with are empty words and empty
promises,'' Joseph Smukler, a lawyer from Philadelphia, said at a
news conference held with Jewish refuseniks at a Moscow apartment.
   Soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legal
system, yet the emigration problem is not being solved, said Irwin
Cotler, a lawyer from Montreal.
   ``There is a legal revolution going on in this country, but the
problem is that the revolution does not embrace the right of
emigration,'' said Cotler, one of 250 lawyers, including Soviet
delegates, at the two-day meeting.
   New Soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a close
relative, something that international law lists as a possible
additional reason to allow emigration, he said.
   Cotler proposed sustained emigration of at least 25,000 Jews a
year, a policy of allowing complete reunification of families, and
protection of religious and cultural rights.
   Emigration of Soviet Jews reached a peak of more than 51,000 in
1979. It dropped to about 1,000 a year in 1984-86 before rising to
more than 8,000 last year. About 4,500 Jews were allowed to
emigrate between January and May 1988.
   Two of the main reasons for refusal are alleged access to state
secrets and refusal of relatives to renounce financial claims
against those who wish to emigrate.
   Lawyers said one Soviet speaker, a lawyer from the Institute of
State and Law they could identify only as Katishkin, said his
institute was studying reforms that could ease those restrictions.
   They said the lawyer proposed that restrictions on emigration
for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to five years,
and that financial claims against would-be emigres be restricted.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday that Rudolf
Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet visa office, told the conference that
Soviet emigration laws are based on international law.
   He said 40,000 people emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987
and 29,000 people left during the first five months of 1988. Those
who left this year are mostly Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans,
he said.
   The lawyers said about 20 Israeli lawyers attended the
conference but that another 10 were refused visas.
   A British lawyer, Jonathan Arkush, said eight other lawyers at
first were denied visas and the International Bar Association
canceled the conference until Soviet officials reversed their
decision.
   He said British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe intervened
to gain visas for him and several other British lawyers.

<HEAD>Audi Agrees To Proposed Settlement In Sudden Acceleration Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc. has offered to pay cash to
some current or former Audi 5000 owners who buy a new Audi to
settle a class-action suit charging that some of the cars were
subject to sudden and unintentional acceleration.
   The proposed settlement, reached last week, was made public
Tuesday. It proposes offering 300,000 owners of Audi 5000 sedans
with automatic transmissions payments of $300 to $2,000 if they buy
a new Audi between Sept. 1, 1988 and June 30, 1991.
   The deal would apply to Audi 5000 sedans built between 1978 and
1986.
   Audi spokesman Tom McDonald said the settlement would not be
approved until after a public hearing July 26 before Cook County
Circuit Judge Harold Siegan.
   McDonald said Audi made no admission of fault in the proposed
settlement.
   The proposed agreement, he said, states that car owners and
investigators have been unable to identify any defect common to the
vehicles that would cause unintended acceleration.
   Audi has been plagued with charges that its Audi 5000 sedans
with automatic transmissions sometimes accelerate on their own.
Despite several investigations, the cause of the problem has never
been pinpointed.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group based in
Washington, contends that at least 1,646 accidents resulting in 402
injuries and five deaths were linked to sudden acceleration when
the car was shifted from park into gear.
   The payments would be made on a sliding scale depending on the
model year of the car they owned and the date they buy a new Audi.

   Colombian cocaine lords have cut back on
production to drive up prices, and one result may be a summer of
drug wars in the city, a prosecutor says.
   ``There won't be a lot of discussions, just boom, boom, boom,''
said Sterling Johnson, the city's special narcotics prosecutor.
``Gangs will be trying to stake out their turfs in a climate where
the supply of cocaine is decreased.''
   Johnson said the price of bulk cocaine had risen from $14,500
per kilogram to $20,000 in the past two weeks. A kilogram, or 2.2
pounds, converts to about 9,000 vials of crack that sell for up to
$10 each on the street.
   ``In one economically arrogant stroke they have created havoc,
and there are going to be a lot of innocent bystanders killed as a
result,'' Johnson said Tuesday at a forum held by a citizens
anti-crime group.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau also said his
office was getting information that cocaine suppliers were holding
back on the narcotic.
   Andrew Maloney, U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said that although
his office had not detected a crimp in the cocaine pipeline, he did
not dispute Johnson's information.

   A student demonstration for more democracy, press
freedom and better treatment of intellectuals failed to materialize
today after armed police cordoned off Beijing's central Tiananmen
Square.
   Dozens of students gathered at the square at mid-afternoon,
apparently traveling from Beijing University and other schools, but
were thwarted by the heavy police presence and did not demonstrate
as planned.
   Police quickly intervened after a dozen students from Beijing
University gathered later at the nearby National Museum of Chinese
Revolution and complained their right of expression had been
violated.
   One person was seen being taken away by police, but the students
said he was not one of them. At dusk, police were continuing to
cordon off the square.
   Beijing authorities and the official media had warned students
that their planned 10-mile march from Beijing University to
Tiananmen was against the law and would undermine the stability
needed to carry out economic and political reform.
   Police stood at attention about 50 feet apart along the
perimeter of the 100-acre Tiananmen Square, which lies in front of
the Forbidden City, the former residence of China's emperors.
   Police reinforcements and vehicles were also deployed along side
streets around the square.
   Police, when asked about the closing said, ``We have a special
activity'' or ``I'm not sure.'' A few students sat in small groups
on the sidewalk, refusing to talk to reporters.
   Students at Beijing University, China's most prestigious center
of learning, announced plans at a late night campus rally Tuesday
for a protest march this afternoon from the campus to Tiananmen.
   It would have been the first major political protest by students
since nationwide student unrest in the winter of 1986-87.
   That outbreak of opposition to government policies prompted a
crackdown on Western liberal ideas. Hu Yaobang, a noted liberal,
was ousted as Communist Party chief for failing to take quick
action to quell the disturbances.
   The current unrest was prompted by the June 2 slaying of a
Beijing University student in an off-campus brawl.
   About 1,000 students staged an all-night march from the campus
to Tiananmen Square after the Chai Qingfeng, 22, was killed. Police
did not interfere with that demonstration, which focused on demands
for a quick resolution to the murder case and did not take up
sensitive political issues.
   Six non-students were arrested for the crime as police moved
quickly to satisfy student demands that the assailants be brought
to justice. But the protest has expanded to cover more general
complaints.
   The campus murder brought to the surface student unhappiness
over poor living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects
after graduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals.
   Since the killing, hundreds have gathered on the campus in the
evenings for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be
learned from the incident.
   Dozens of posters have been pasted up on bulletin boards
demanding democracy, a free press, an end to government corruption
and greater respect and higher salaries for intellectuals.

<HEAD>Order Frees Hundreds of Prisoners in Philadelphia</HEAD>

   A federal court ordered the city to release
hundreds of inmates from its overcrowded prisons by this evening, a
move that a prosecutor says will embolden criminals with the
knowledge they face little chance of going to jail.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday ordered the
city to comply with a ruling restricting the prison population to
3,750 inmates, 300 less than the number held as of Saturday.
   The city began releasing on bail Monday inmates being held on
bail of $2,500 or less. By early today, 170 inmates had been
released, said City Solicitor Sy Kurland.
   ``We should be down to the constitutional limit,'' he said. ``We
feel pretty confident that we can be down to the 3,750 within 24
hours.''
   The order forces authorities to release the additional inmates
on bail the city must provide. As long as a threat to exceed the
cap exists, authorities will be allowed to imprison only the most
serious criminals.
   ``You are going to have whole classes of people who can't be put
in prison,'' said Sarah Vandenbraak, who represented the district
attorney's office in opposing the cap.
   ``Ninety-nine percent of the drug dealers we prosecute won't get
in prison _ not even the major drug dealers. If you deal a ton of
marijuana today, you will be on the streets tomorrow; it's not
enough to put you in prison.''
   The order also will discourage prosecution in drug cases, she
said.
   ``Legally, cases can go forth, but if you see it is a wasted
effort, it's hard to gear up to do it,'' Ms. Vandenbraak said.
``What's the point of arresting drug dealers if they just can come
back every day?''
   But prisoners' attorney David Richman said the population limit
was proper.
   ``I would feel a lot safer knowing that our prisons were being
operated in a humane, civilized fashion so that they didn't breed
crime,'' Richman said after a lower court ruling Friday.
   ``People who allow jails which subject the residents to
indignities, that don't afford any opportunity for rehabilitation,
are just going to get people returned to them who are embittered
and more prone to commit crime, and that's a situation we've been
living in for far too long.''
   The population ceiling was set in a consent decree the city
signed in 1986 and originally was scheduled to meet a year ago. The
agreement stemmed from a 1982 class-action lawsuit by inmates
challenging conditions in Philadelphia's four prisons.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Norma Shapiro ordered the cap to
take effect at midnight Monday.
   The appeals court issued an emergency stay at the request of
District Attorney Ronald Castille, who said he needed time to
prepare a formal appeal. But it unexpectedly reversed itself
Tuesday in a one-sentence order that gave no explanation.
   After the reversal, Ms. Shapiro modified her order, giving the
city until 5 p.m. today to meet the cap and to restrict admissions.
Inmates released to meet the limit would be those awaiting trial
rather than those convicted because she has said she lacked power
to reduce sentences imposed in state courts.
   Ms. Vandenbraak said the city will not take further legal action
until another hearing scheduled before Ms. Shapiro on June 22.
   The city will be barred from admitting new inmates, except those
charged with the most serious crimes, including murder, attempted
murder, rape, attempted rape, kidnapping, arson, robbery and
aggravated assault in addition to crimes involving use of a gun or
knife or large amounts of drugs.
   Other suspects will be arraigned, given court dates and freed.
The order requires the city to provide up to $250 bail for each
suspect.
   That, said Ms. Vandenbraak, means the city ends up footing the
bill to put dangerous criminals back on the street.
   ``We'll be monitoring these people,'' Castille said. ``We'll be
waiting for them to be coming back with a murder, or rape, or
robbery, or shooting. And then we'll lay the blame where it
belongs, with the mayor and the city solicitor.''
   Castille, who believes that city prisons can humanely hold at
least 4,300 inmates, said Mayor Wilson Goode and City Solicitor Sy
Kurland should never have agreed to the prison population cap.
   Kurland blamed the Reagan administration for not providing
enough money to build prisons.
   The city is building a fifth prison, scheduled for completion in
1991.
   ``That's only 440 beds. That's no going to solve the problem,''
Ms. Vandenbraak said.

   A construction worker stole an earth grader
and roared six miles along a highway to an airport, where he bashed
three planes and a hangar before being wounded by police gunfire,
authorities said.
   Randy LaComb, 37, of Anaheim told police he was upset about his
marriage.
   He was hit by least five bullets and was in stable condition at
San Bernardino County Medical Center. LaComb was booked for
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. No one else was
injured.
   During a five-minute rampage at the airport, LaComb struck three
small planes with the 10-foot high vehicle and nearly hit several
people, police said. He also threatened to knock down the airport
tower, officials said.
   ``At some points he actually seemed to be having fun,'' said
airport worker Darin Ford. ``People in the hangars he passed said
he was smiling and waving.''
   Police, state workers and utility employees chased the grader
during LaComb's half-hour ride Tuesday from a construction site to
Chino Airport, six miles away.
   LaComb forced several cars off the road and narrowly missed
several bicyclists, said Jim Bryant, a spokesman for the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's department.
   The chase ended when the grader's front end became jammed
against a hangar. Police and sheriff's deputies fired when he
attempted to drive away, according to Bryant.
   Jett Reeves, a worker at the hangar struck by the grader, said
LaComb came within 50 yards of hitting the business' fuel tanks.
``It almost looked like the guy in there was laughing,'' Reeves
said. ``He sure looked happy.''
   Chino is about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.

   Tass said today that 80 people were killed in last
weekend's train explosion in the Soviet Union's Volga Valley. The
news agency said initial results of a probe showed human error was
not to blame for the blast.
   Three boxcars packed with industrial explosives blew up
Saturday, injuring 229 people. The accident occurred in Arzamas, an
industrial city about 240 miles east of Moscow.
   Earlier media reports said 73 people had died but warned more
deaths could be expected.
   A government commission is investigating the accident, and Tass
said preliminary results indicated the blast was caused by recent
high temperatures.
   ``The cargo was handled and carried in keeping with instructions
and the diesel locomotive was in good repair,'' the official Soviet
news agency said.
   It did not elaborate about the cause. Soviet media has reported
the explosives were intended for geologists and miners.
   Tass also reported repair work was being carried out by 2,000
construction workers sent to the site and that housing was being
provided for the 600 Soviets left homeless by the accident.
   The explosion flattened houses several city blocks around the
blast site and shattered windows as far as two miles away.
   The Soviet press reported extensively on the accident, an
apparent sign of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost'' or
greater openness. Results of accident were never reported in detail
before Gorbachev came to power in March 1985.

   More than 1 million black
workers and students stayed home today as a nationwide general
strike moved into its third and final day. Police reported
widespread violence.
   Ten people were killed during the strike, South Africa's longest
and biggest general strike.
   Police said they dispersed unruly crowds with shotguns and tear
gas.
   Black labor unions and anti-apartheid groups staged the boycott
to protest a 2-year-old state of emergency, more recent
restrictions on their activities and proposed legislation to
restrict the rights of unions to strike.
   The death toll from violence reported by police since the strike
began Monday rose to 10 with the shotgun death of a toddler and the
machete-killing of a young man.
   Overnight, a train engine and freight car were derailed near
Johannesburg; buses, private trucks, police vehicles, and homes
were firebombed and stoned in several townships in Natal and
Transvaal province, police said.
   They said 15 people were injured and 25 arrested.
   The government has said the protest is illegal, and employers
said Tuesday that workers were returning to their jobs in many
areas.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largest
black union group, said at least 2.5 million people had honored the
boycott.
   Independent analysts said those figures were probably high. But
based on the low numbers of passengers riding buses and trains from
the black townships to cities such as Johannesburg, Durban and Port
Elizabeth, the absentee rate among black workers nationwide easily
could exceed 1.5 million, they said.
   Including the near-total boycott by urban black students, the
figure for each day would have surpassed 2 million, the estimated
number of people who stayed home on June 16, 1986, during a protest
against the beginning of the national state of emergency.
   That strike was the longest staged over many different economic
sectors.
   The congress said it would consider meeting with the
government's manpower chief to discuss the labor bill that sparked
the strike.
   Police said a 22-year-old man was hacked to death with a machete
in Hammarsdale, in Natal, and a 2-year-old child was found dead
with a shotgun wound to the chest in Ashdown, also in Natal.
   They said a group of blacks killed the man after setting homes
on fire, but they gave no details on the death of the child.
   Police reported using shotgun fire, tear gas and rubber bullets
to disperse crowds in several cases of violence in Natal, where
groups who oppose the strike have clashed with militant protest
supporters.
   The black trade union group called on employers to participate
in an independent inquiry into the effects of the labor bill, which
all black unions have opposed. It said it would also consider
meeting with Manpower Minister Pieter du Plessis to discuss the
legislation, which is about to be passed in the white-dominated
Parliament.
   Congress leader Jay Naidoo said the strike reflected ``the
wide-scale resentment and anger'' about orders issued in February
that barred his organization and other anti-apartheid groups from
political activity.
   President P.W. Botha's government imposed the emergency June 12,
1986, to combat a black uprising against apartheid, under which
South Africa's 5 million whites control the country and deny its 26
million blacks a voice in national affairs.
   Du Plessis has warned workers that they might be dismissed from
their jobs for participating in the strike.
   Police have warned news media about reporting on the extent of
the strike, and the government-run broadcasting services have
continually given upbeat reports about percentages of workers
returning to their jobs since Monday.
   Figures from government and private transport companies and
employers indicated that the black workforce attendance in most of
the Johannesburg-Pretoria area was half of normal. In Durban, the
nation's third largest city, about 90 percent of the workers were
staying home.
   The private PUTCO bus company said ridership from black
townships east of Johannesburg was 98 percent below normal.
Ridership from Soweto however was 40 percent below average,
representing a steady increase each day from the country's largest
black township.
   Despite reports of the strike's success, the mining industry,
which produces 80 percent of South Africa's export earnings, has
been only slightly affected by the protest.

   Jesse Jackson said today his showing in the
Democratic primaries had earned him an offer of the vice
presidential spot, and not ``just in passing.''
   Jackson refused to say his presidential hopes were completely
gone, contending that ``It's not over till it's over in Atlanta''
at the Democratic National Convention. But in television interviews
he repeatedly spoke of having earned a vice presidential offer,
suggesting recognition that Dukakis had sewn up the presidential
nomination.
   ``I've earned an option to accept it or turn it down,'' Jackson
said of the No. 2 spot in an interview on CBS-TV, taped earlier.
   He added, on ABC-TV, ``Consideration does mean an offer; it does
not mean just in passing. We have earned consideration.'' He did
not say whether he would accept such an offer.
   Dukakis said on ABC, ``I don't think anyone is due an offer.''
He added, ``There are a great many people that are going to be
considered and he'll be one of them and I'm not going to rule
anybody in or out at this point.''
   Jackson said he had clearly stated his intentions regarding his
hopes for himself and demands for positions he wants the Democratic
Party to take.
   But he added, ``No one running in a process like this plays with
transparent cards. You have to have the wisdom to use your leverage
to maximize change.''
   In his concession speech Tuesday night, Jackson congratulated
Dukakis for a ``well managed and dignified campaign'' and said
their contest had been fought without rancor.
   But Jackson told supporters at an election night celebration
that the ``super delegates'' and at-large delegates are ``fluid
until they vote in Atlanta _ that's why we will continue until the
roll call in Atlanta.''
   He plans to continue traveling and making public appearances,
and said he will be contacting every super delegate and at-large
delegate for support.
   Jackson praised Dukakis, who on Tuesday gained enough delegates
to cinch the nomination, for staying ``above the fray, above the
attacks, above the meanness.''
   ``The governor has run a well-managed and dignified campaign ...
I believe that we have shown that it is possible to compete without
conflict, differ without division.''
   Jackson supporters said his losses by margins of more than
two-to-one in the California, Montana, New Jersey and New Mexico,
were expected.
   In California, where Jackson's campaign had placed heavy
resources and commitment, he had his best showing, hovering close
to 35 percent, with 69 percent of the vote counted.
   ``Anything over 30 percent is a very significant performance,''
said Bert Lance, a Jackson adviser and former confidant to
President Jimmy Carter.
   California campaign director Mike Murase said his results showed
Jackson did as expected in California and that he won several
cities in New Jersey, but was beaten badly in that state's rural
areas.
   CBS News tracking polls showed Jackson got 25 percent of the
white vote in California, one of his better showings among whites
across the nation, but only 9 percent of the white vote in New
Jersey.
   In his speech at the Los Angeles Hilton, Jackson chose to
emphasize the legacy of his campaign rather than dwell on his
continued march to the summer Democratic convention.
   He said he had successfully injected themes into the political
debate this year, most notably bringing the drug crisis to the top
of the political agenda.
   He said he has ``built a mighty coalition'' that will continue
to be heard.
   ``Together we have ushered in a new political era ... A new era
of citizen action, of concern and care, of hope and change is
beginning.''
   ``We have created a new permanent force in American politics ...
We're here to stay. Tonight is not a celebration. This is a
declaration,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, Jackson was peppered with questions about
whether he agreed with some of his top advisers that Dukakis should
offer to make him his running mate.
   He repeated earlier statements that he deserves consideration.
But Jackson also said it's up to the convention to determine the
nominee and his running mate, hinting that would be one reason to
continue building delegate strength.
   ``The commitments made by at-large and super delegates are
non-binding until convention time, and so it's appropriate to make
appeals to delegates based upon friendship, based upon constituent
considerations,'' he told reporters.
   Jackson in recent days has increasingly stressed that the
presidential nomination process does not end with the last
primaries, but goes on to the politicking at the national
convention.
   Lance said he does not think it will be divisive for Jackson to
remain an active candidate. ``There's nothing wrong with courting
the super delegates,'' he said. ``I think Jesse Jackson has been
good for the party.''
   ``He's still got a message,'' said another supporter, former New
Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya.
   After months of a grueling breakneck campaign pace, Jackson
planned to head to San Diego today for a two-day vacation with his
family before returning home to Chicago.

<HEAD>Large Heroin Haul in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police seized 45 pounds of
heroin hidden in hollowed-out rocks coated to resemble jade and
arrested at least three people in the third-biggest drug haul in
Canadian history, authorities said.
   The street value of the haul was variously estimated by police
at $120 million and $154 million.
   Terry Langley, director of intelligence for Canada Customs, said
Tuesday that 20.5 kilograms _ more than 45 pounds _ of 87 percent
pure heroin was seized in Vancouver. Three people were arrested in
Windsor, Ontario, on Monday.
   ``It represents a tremendous amount of heroin in any man's
language, anywhere in the world,'' said Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Staff Sgt. Smokey Stovern.
   By comparison, the French Connection ring smuggled about 70
pounds of heroin into the United States from 1968 to 1971.
   Langley said customs agents in Vancouver became suspicious about
paperwork for a shipment listed as jade from Bangkok, Thailand, to
Montreal. The shipment, packed in wooden crates, was intercepted by
Canadian Customs in Vancouver May 9 after being trucked across the
border from Seattle, police said.
   The rocks turned out to be granite, not jade, and X-rays showed
a cavity in one. ``When they broke one of the rocks, they
discovered the heroin,'' Langley said.
   Langley said the smugglers had drilled out the rocks, stuffed
them with heroin, sealed the holes and then coated the rocks with a
green-tinged dirt and sand mixture to make them look like jade.
``It was a very good job,'' he said.
   Mounties removed most of the heroin and replaced it with a
lookalike powder. The Mounties followed the shipment to Montreal
and waited for someone to claim the rocks. The path eventually led
to the Windsor area.
   John Laudicina, 42, of Sandwich South Township near Windsor;
Joseph Guaragna, 23, and Antonio Zambito, 46, both of Montreal,
were arrested Monday in a raid on a home about 12 miles east of
Windsor, authorities said.
   They were charged with possession of narcotics and face a
maximum sentence of life in prison.
   ``We've never really come into contact with this type of
concealment before,'' Langley said. ``The majority of our
experience in the past has dealt with false-sided suitcases and
body packs for heroin.''
   The largest heroin haul in Canadian history was 60 kilos, or 132
pounds, in 1972, and 70 pounds were confiscated in 1986, both in
Montreal, officials said.
   A drug crackdown in the United States is diverting shipments to
Canada, and Vancouver is a prime port of entry because of its
proximity to Southeast Asia, the origin of much of the heroin and
other drugs, Langley said.

   High school graduation ceremonies in an
affluent Erie suburb have been canceled over fears that some
students might try to commit suicide on stage, officials said.
   About 150 seniors were to have received their diplomas on Sunday
in the Fairview School District.
   ``The problem is if one person on this stage shoots himself or
someone else, the board is responsible'' and the board has
``evidence there is a possibility this could happen,'' district
Solicitor Frank Kroto said Tuesday at a meeting of board members
and parents.
   A senior at the school committed suicide over the Christmas
vacation in front of another student. In addition, several
administrators have received threats and are under police
protection, Kroto said.
   ``It's more than just pranks,'' Kroto said of the threats today.
   ``Certain students and certain groups of students continue to
make threats ... and there's enough substance to what they say and
what else is happening in the community to make the school board
aware of it.''
   Psychologists and psychiatrists were brought in to counsel
students and teachers after the suicide, said board President
Barbara Junker. Kroto said there were unofficial reports
circulating that more students had attempted suicide.
   ``Over the course of the past several months, we have been in
constant contact with various individuals and groups within the
student body who have threatened to cause serious disruption at
this year's graduation,'' Ms. Junker said.
   ``It is with great sorrow and regret that the board has
concluded they cannot insure you, your childrens' nor your guests'

<HEAD>Watered-Down Version of Bill on Parental Leave Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators today announced
a watered-down version of a bill requiring private firms to offer
unpaid leave to new parents, but the bipartisan compromise failed
to draw business support.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chief sponsor of the new
measure, said he and his colleagues ``made some very tough
decisions and major changes designed to reduce the cost of the bill
and help employers plan for workers taking unpaid leave.''
   The bill introduced today by 16 Democrats and six Republicans
would require businesses with 20 or more workers to offer
job-protected parental and medical leave to employees who had been
with a firm at least a year. The original bill covered businesses
with 15 or more workers without regard for the length of service.
   Employees would be entitled to up to 10 weeks on the birth,
adoption or serious illness of a child, or 13 weeks of medical
leave for a personal illness. That compares to 18 weeks and 26
weeks, respectively, in the initial bill.
   The General Accounting Office said the new version of the plan
would cost employers less than $194 million, most of that in health
insurance premiums for employees on leave. The GAO estimated the
initial Dodd bill would have cost less than $500 million.
   The Concerned Alliance of Responsible Employers, a coalition of
corporations and business groups, said it remains opposed to ``this
well-intentioned but misguided legislation.''
   The alliance, one of many business groups fighting parental
leave bills in the House and Senate, said changes in the amount of
leave and the number of eligible workers haven't changed its
opposition to government-mandated employee benefits of any type.
   The House Education and Labor Committee last November passed a
family and medical leave act requiring firms of over 50 employees
to offer at least 10 weeks' unpaid leave to parents and up to 15
weeks for a personal illness. The bill, unlike its Senate
counterpart, also requires that leave be available to employees who
must care for a sick relative other than a child.

<HEAD>Simon Ends Campaign, Endorses Dukakis</HEAD>

   Sen. Paul Simon, saying ``the verdict is in,''
today formally pulled the curtain on his quest for the Democratic
presidential nomination and endorsed Michael Dukakis.
   The Illinois senator said he would urge his 150 or so Democratic
delegates to join him in backing the Massachusetts governor unless
they have strong leanings toward another candidate from Illinois,
Jesse Jackson.
   Simon suspended his faltering campaign two months ago, saying he
anticipated a brokered convention in Atlanta. That never
materialized.
   ``Conventional wisdom has conventionally been wrong on just
about everything,'' he said at a news conference at Democratic
National Committee Headquarters.
   ``The primaries and caucuses are now history. The verdict is in.
I will vote for Michael Dukakis at the convention and will do
everything I can to advance his candidacy after the convention,''
he said.
   The Illinois senator had amassed about 180 delegates, primarily
on the strength of his home-state win in the March 15 Illinois
primary. But about 30 had defected in recent weeks, most to Dukakis.
   His failure to drop out of the race earlier angered some Jackson
supporters. In a bow to them, Simon said, ``I will urge delegates
who have no strong commitment in any other direction to vote for
Michael Dukakis.''
   He said Dukakis must make clear ``that he has a positive program
of jobs, for quality education, for long-term care, for moving away
from the arms race, for things our party traditionally has stood
for.''
   The bow-tied, liberal Simon, whose hopes were buoyed by his
second-place finish behind Richard Gephardt in Iowa's opening
caucuses last February, said Dukakis ``clearly is more sensitive to
the fundamental needs of our nation'' than Republican George Bush.
   ``I am releasing my delegates, though I expect to work with them
on the platform and other matters that may come before the
convention,'' he said.
   He praised Jackson, who he said ``has contributed immensely to
our party by making us more sensitive to the needs of the less
fortunate.''
   But he said Democratic voters had clearly chosen Dukakis, ``who
through the course of this campaign has demonstrated his leadership
skills, his substance and his commitment to progress for all
Americans.''
   Dukakis, who sewed up the nomination by sweeping Tuesday's final
primaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico, was
also headed to Missouri today to pick up the endorsement of another
erstwhile rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   In February, he came out of the gate finishing a close second in
the Iowa caucuses behind Gephardt, and third in New Hampshire's
primary behind Dukakis and Gephardt.
   But with the exception of his home-state win, it was mostly
downhill from there as Simon went down in the polls and deeper into
debt. He sat out the March 8 Super Tuesday primaries across the
South, then fared poorly in contests in Michigan, Wisconsin and
elsewhere.
   He said in April that he wanted to hang onto his delegates to
have some influence over whom the party nominated.
   But in recent weeks, more than 30 of Simon's 180 delegates
defected, most to Dukakis.
   Simon, 59, a freshman senator whose term expires in 1990, ran as
an unabashed liberal Democrat. ``I'm not a neo-anything,'' he
boasted.
   He promised to curb the arms race and to provide long-term
health care for the elderly, public works jobs for the unemployed
and major new education initiatives.
   He encountered skepticism about how he would comply with another
promise: balancing the budget in three years.
   Suspending his campaign two months ago instead of ending it
allowed Simon to retain 47 at-large Illinois delegates who
otherwise would have gone to Jesse Jackson, the runner-up in the
Illinois primary. That rankled Jackson supporters.
   Simon has expressed little interest in the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket, saying last Friday, ``I'm frankly not interested
in spending four years cutting ribbons and attending state
funerals.''
   And he made clear on April 7 that his first fling at the
presidency was also his last.
   ``Running for president is a little like taking an ice-cold
shower,'' he said then. ``It's a great one-time experience, but I
have no yearning for a repeat performance.''

   A faulty fan started an apartment house
blaze that killed five children, a man and a pregnant woman, the
fire chief said today.
   A woman and two other men were injured in the early-morning fire
Tuesday one floor above a used furniture store in a dilapidated
section of this southwestern Ohio city.
   The building's sole street-level access door was padlocked in
violation of the city fire code, said Fire Chief Don Lickert.
Residents apparently locked and unlocked the padlock by reaching
through a window in the door, he said.
   Lickert said a fan on the floor of the living room is believed
to have started the fire. Temperatures soared into the 90s the day
before the fire, and overnight lows fell to the 60s.
   ``We don't know if the motor froze or if the cord shorted out,''
he said. ``It will be checked by an electrical engineer.''
   Lickert said the the building's owners will receive a $100
citation for not having a working smoke detector in the apartment.
   Six of the seven victims were found beneath a boarded window
that also may have prevented their escape, the chief said. However,
there were at least two unblocked windows in the apartment, fire
officials said.
   The seventh victim, a 30-year-old man, was found in a
second-floor hallway.
   The victims died of smoke inhalation, according to Butler County
Coroner Dr. Richard Burkhardt.
   Elizabeth Blackburn, who owns the building with her husband,
Art, said she was unaware of the padlocked door on the three-story,
wooden-frame building.
   Under the city code, there should have been at least one smoke
detector for each of the three apartments on the second floor, and
another in the hallway, but Lickert said firefighters found only
one smoke detector, with no batteries.
   City inspectors had noted the lack of smoke detectors in a
previous inspection and Mrs. Blackburn had them installed,
officials said.
   Firefighters could not account for the missing detectors,
Lickert said.
   ``Routine inspections would have stopped the likelihood of
something like this happening,'' said Dr. William Karwische, city
health commissioner.
   Killed were Faye Dunham Reeseman, 18, and her 2-year-old son,
Christopher, who occupied one apartment; Mary Smith, 6; Jennifer
Miller, 4; and twins Wesley and James Miller, 2. Ms. Reeseman was
three months pregnant, the coroner said.
   Mrs. Blackburn said the Smith girl and the Millers were the
children of Karen Miller, 30, who was hospitalized in serious
condition. Ms. Miller and her children lived in a second apartment,
officials said.
   There was no indication whether Lee Cooper, whose body was found
in the hallway, was related to the other victims.
   A 24-year-old man and a 20-year-old man were hospitalized in
fair condition.

<HEAD>Reagan Favored in Senate Showdown on Trade Bill Veto</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 4 grafs new with White House comment. Picks up 2nd graf

   The White House expressed confidence today
about winning a Senate attempt to override President Reagan's veto
of comprehensive trade legislation and predicted a substitute
measure can be enacted that would be acceptable.
   ``We believe the veto will be sustained,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He said the administration will begin
working quickly with Congress on another version.
   ``Our discussions with the Congress indicate that a number of
members would like to have a trade bill _ Democrat and Republican _
that they feel it's important for the country, as well as
politically, and the committee leadership certainly is interested
in a bill,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``I think there is a growing body that feels like a trade bill
is needed and can be passed,'' he added.
   Some, such as Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., a strong supporter of the
bill, say they still think a version acceptable to Reagan can be
fashioned this session.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Tuesday
that the bill's ``pulse is still beating,'' but there was nothing
he could do to budge perhaps 36 senators prepared to sustain
Reagan's veto.
   Byrd told reporters there was still hope that home-state
pressures would change a few minds at the last minute.
   The House already has voted to override Reagan's veto. Senate
failure to follow suit could doom trade legislation for the rest of
1988 and send some administration loyalists into fall campaigns
with an Achilles heel on the issue.
   ``This veto is going to be used as a political issue this year;
we all know that,'' Heinz warned his colleagues.
   Some administration supporters clearly would like another crack
at the issue before November. The administration has been urging a
scaled-down bill that would win the president's support. But Byrd
has been warning that a fres bill would be peppered with amendments
and could become hopelessly bogged down.
   The bill's chief provisions would overhaul the system under
which the government imposes import curbs to aid U.S. industries
and retaliate against international trade violations.
   Other features range from a potential $2 billion in agricultural
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil-industry
earnings.
   Reagan's May 24 veto focused on a provision that would require
companies with 100 employees or more to provide their workers with
60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. He said
the provision would take away too much management flexibility.
Reagan also was critical of restrictions in the bill on Alaskan oil
exports.
   A two-thirds majority is needed in Congress to override a
presidential veto. The bill's backers failed to gain that when the
Senate passed the bill 63-36 on April 27, and the lawmakers
appeared to remain frozen in the positions they took then.
   The only Democrat to oppose the measure was retiring Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis., who has fought provisions that would
relax the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   Obtaining criminal convictions of businessmen for overseas
payoffs would become more difficult because of the changes.
``That's why I call it the bring-back-bribery bill,'' Proxmire said
Tuesday.
   As debate began, Heinz said the political potential of the issue
should not prompt lawmakers to give up on trying to fashion a bill
that Reagan would sign.
   ``Anybody can just sit in the stands and boo the umpire,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance to pull this game out _ albeit in extra
innings _ we should at least take our last at bats.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said getting another
trade bill through this year might take an agreement that would bar
amendments. He said there was precedent for doing that but
indicated it still might be difficult.
   ``If the president's veto is sustained,'' said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., ``it may be a long, long time before we get
another chance to pass a comprehensive trade bill. Don't let anyone
tell you that it will be as simple as passing the same trade bill
without the plant-closing provision to which the president
objects.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told lawmakers that Reagan's
veto could be ``described only as a triumph of ideology over
fairness and good sense.''
   ``Will we give America's workers 60 days notice of plant
closings and mass layoffs?'' Kennedy said. ``Or will we allow them
to be treated like chattel, thrown onto the street when business
has no further use for them?''
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, however, said the plant-closings
provision could hurt advertising agencies and other companies
dependent on contracts that can be canceled suddenly. He said that
in such cases, the businesses might have to keep hundreds of highly
paid employees on the payroll without any work to do.
   ``I'm a believer in the adage,'' Grassley said, ``if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty of Indiana's 92 counties were declared federal disaster
areas today because of a drought threatening Midwest crops.
   Elsewhere, an Atlanta-area fire chief worried about hydrants
going dry, and the Art Institute of Chicago was warned to halt
daytime watering of lawns as officials in drought-gripped regions
imposed new restrictions on water use.
   Earlier this week, 24 other Indiana counties were declared
disaster areas by the federal government, thereby permitting
emergency grazing and haying on land set aside under government
programs.
   If it doesn't rain soon, farmers in southern Indiana may face
the worst spring drought in 25 years, said Jack Washburn, Harrison
County extension agent. The Midwest has had no significant rainfall
since the end of April.
   Water usage in Indianapolis on Tuesday was a record 182.15
million gallons, breaking the old mark of 175 million gallons set
the week before, water company officials said.
   With pastures deteriorating in Illinois, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng agreed Tuesday to a request from state
congressional leaders for an emergency decree allowing farmers to
graze livestock and collect hay in 35 counties normally off-limits
under federal programs.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich sent a letter Tuesday asking Lyng to
release for haying and grazing all or part of the nearly 2 million
acres the state's farmers have enrolled in a conservation program.
The action would help farmers avoid excessive feed costs caused by
drought, Perpich said.
   Crop yields are down substantially throughout Minnesota, farmers
said.
   ``Even if it does rain, it's not going to do much good unless
some lucky farmer gets a thundershower above his farm,'' said Art
Ramsdell of the National Weather Service in Paducah, Ky., just
across the Illinois line. ``We've got no relief in sight.''
   In Kentucky, state water officials said the drought is rated
severe in the horse-breeding country around Lexington, and moderate
or mild elsewhere.
   Berea, 30 miles south of Lexington, is the most parched area in
the state with rainfall 9.6 inches below normal, according to Pamla
A. Wood, supervisor of the water-quantity management section of the
state Division of Water.
   In northern Georgia, only a few showers and thundershowers were
expected today.
   In several subdivisions north of Atlanta, hydrants ran dry
Monday night. Fulton County Fire Chief James Gibson said Tuesday
there would have been serious problems had a major fire broken out.
   Restrictions on watering lawns were imposed in northern Fulton
County, Roswell north of Atlanta and Carrollton near the Alabama
border.
   In Illinois, restrictions went into effect in Chicago, suburbs
north and south of the city, Mahomet in the central section of the
state and Troy in the south.
   The Art Institute was warned it was violating restrictions by
watering lawns during the day, said Chicago Water Department
spokeswoman Cindy Gountanis. Watering is allowed only at night and
during a few hours after dawn.
   ``Our people also put about 1,000 locking caps on fire hydrants
in areas where people are prone to turning them on to get cool,''
Ms. Gountanis said. ``That can cause serious local pressure drops.''
   Chicago does not have a water shortage. However, communities
farther from Lake Michigan were reporting problems with water
pressure, she said.
   ``Normally, we have around 10 to 11 feet (of water) in our
reservoir, but we were down to 6 feet,'' said Tim Scheunke, manager
of suburban La Grange Park Village.
   Illinois corn and soybeans are beginning to show signs of stress
but ``look pretty decent'' considering what the area is going
through, said Tom Stoutenborogh, agricultural adviser in central
Illinois' Coles County.
   ``We've just got to have rain soon or we're going to go
downhill,'' Stoutenborogh added.

   The White House said today President Reagan
still stands by his Star Wars anti-missile program despite a
congressional study that says its electronic brains would be so
large and complex that there is a ``significant probability'' they
would fail.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan has not been
briefed on the study.
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, ``Suffice to say the president
still believes in the Strategic Defense Initiative program. He
believes in its potential and certainly has no plans to change our
policy or our priority status for SDI.''
   The report Tuesday by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment is the latest in a series of scientific studies to
criticize Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, as the 5-year-old
program is formally known.
   The study's harshest criticism was reserved for the computer
systems which would be needed for ``battle management,'' the
Pentagon term for tracking and targeting Soviet missiles.
   ``In OTA's judgment, there would be a significant probability
(i.e., one large enough to take seriously) that the first (and
presumably only) time the BMD system were used in a real war, it
would suffer a catastrophic failure,'' said the report. BMD stands
for ballistic missile defense.
   It added that there is no effective way to test such a system
and ``no adequate models for the development, production, test and
maintenance of software for full-scale BMD systems exist.''
   The Pentagon-based Strategic Defense Initiative Organization
issued a statement which said the conclusions reflect ``opinion
rather than real analysis, and are based primarily on extrapolation
from past experience as opposed to the potential of the newer
technologies becoming available in SDI research and in the computer
industry.''
   The statement also said, ``The OTA assertion that strategic
defense software cannot be tested sufficiently for operational
confidence, short of war, is already at variance with several
decades of developing strategic warning and today's offensive
missile deterrent systems.''
   Reagan said he wanted his program to have a goal of making
nuclear weapons obsolete, but the Pentagon and SDI backers have
pushed for deployment in the mid-1990s of a ``phase one'' Star Wars
shield that would have a much more limited goal.
   Pentagon officials last year estimated that it would cost $75
billion to $150 billion to build a phase one system comprised of
ground-based rockets and space-based ``garages'' full of missiles
which could be fired at attacking Soviet missiles.
   The phase one proposals call for basically using existing
technology rather than the exotic, futuristic technologies such as
lasers and beam weapons that were a focus of early SDI research.
   But the OTA report said the Soviets could use nuclear-tipped
anti-satellite weapons which could knock out a phase one SDI
system. The Soviets already have an operational ASAT system.
   The Soviet ASATs ``would pose a significant threat to all three
defense system phases, but particularly to the first two,'' OTA
said. ``Such weapons deployed in quantity, especially with multiple
decoys (to confuse the U.S. system) would threaten to degrade
severely the performance of a first- or second-phase'' SDI system,
the study said.
   The OTA report was released despite the Pentagon's refusal to
declassify three chapters in the 12-chapter document. The
classified chapters dealt with possible countermeasures and tactics
which could be used against an SDI system.
   Thomas Karas, director of the study, said he didn't understand
why the three chapters had been withheld from the public by the
Pentagon. They were so general that the Soviets could not likely
gain much military advantage from reading the material, he said.
   The Pentagon statement said the chapters ``reman difficult to
declassify'' and a final decision will be made in the near future.
   The report said it was unable to estimate, with a ``precise
degree,'' how well the U.S. system could survive a Soviet attack
because that would depend ``on the tactics employed by each side
and on the evitable uncertainties of battle.''
   Congress has consistently cut Reagan's requests for SDI
spending. The program receives $3.9 billion in the current fiscal
year.
   For the 1989 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Senate has voted
$4.6 billion while the House has approved $3.5 billion, with a
compromise to be worked out by a Senate-House conference committee.
Reagan had sought $4.8 billion.

   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis today celebrated victorious conclusions to the long primary
season, with Dukakis declaring, ``The marathon is over and now the
race to the finish line begins.'' Jesse Jackson renewed his claim
on the Democrats' No. 2 spot but Dukakis said no one ``is due an
offer.''
   Both Bush and Dukakis, assured of their parties' presidential
nominations, pledged a tough but clean election fight offering
voters a clear choice.
   ``I feel terrific. Here I am as the Democratic nominee,''
Dukakis exulted in an interview broadcast today on CBS-TV.
   Jackson, his last remaining opponent, promised in interviews
broadcast today that he would continue the nomination fight all the
way to the convention in Atlanta. But Jackson, implicitly conceding
the fight was really over, said repeatedly he had earned a Dukakis
offer of the vice presidential spot.
   ``I've earned an option to accept it or turn it down,'' he said
on CBS in an interview taped earlier. On ABC-TV he said,
``Consideration does mean an offer; it does not mean just in
passing. We have earned consideration.'' He did not say whether he
would accept such an offer.
   Dukakis, making no promises, said on ABC, ``I don't think anyone
is due an offer.''
   He told reporters later in the day, ``I'm going to cast my net
far and wide.'' He said Jackson deserved consideration, ``but there
are other people to be considered as well, and it's up to the
nominee to make that selection.''
   In Washington today, former candidate Paul Simon said he would
support Dukakis for president, and he urged his 150 or so remaining
delegates to do the same unless they felt strongly they should
support Jackson.
   Sen. Simon, D-Ill., who had put his fading campaign on hold two
months ago, said at a news conference, ``The primaries and caucuses
are now history. The verdict is in. I will vote for Michael Dukakis
at the convention and will do everything I can to advance his
candidacy after the convention.''
   Dukakis was also picking up formal support today from former
rivals Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.
   ``The race to the finish line begins,'' proclaimed a jubilant
Dukakis after returns from a four-state primary sweep guaranteed
him a delegate majority. He won races in California, New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico.
   ``Now we'll be going into the major-league ballgame and I am
ready on the issues,'' declared Bush, who locked up the GOP
nomination more than a month ago and cruised to uncontested wins in
the states voting Tuesday.
   Dukakis' season-ending sweep gave the Massachusetts governor
victories in 30 states. The marathon primary contest began with
seven contenders, but over the last two months came down to a
head-to-head battle between Dukakis and Jackson.
   The magic number for a convention majority was 2,081 and Dukakis
easily surpassed that with his landslide finale. His delegate total
after Tuesday's sweep stood at 2,251, according to the latest
Associated Press count.
   Confronted by polls saying Dukakis was the current choice of a
majority of voters, Bush said, ``I'm fighting back. I'm the
underdog now.''
   While Dukakis could enter the race with an edge in polls showing
Americans wanting a change after nearly eight years of Ronald
Reagan's presidency, Bush could find strength in the Republican
hold on the electoral votes of Southern and Western states.
   The vice president was meeting this morning in Washington with
Reagan.
   Dukakis said voters were not interested in ``slashing attacks''
and he warned the Republicans not to engage in ``mudslinging and
name-calling.''
   ``I don't think you have to run a negative, nasty campaign,''
said Bush. ``What I think you have to do though is be sure the
American people perceive what you really want for this country.''
   Party unity and the search for running mates were top priorities
for both Bush and Dukakis as they looked ahead to their party
conventions _ the Democrats in July, the Republicans in August _
and beyond.
   Bush was flying to Denver Friday to open a unity conference at
which three of his former rivals for the nomination would appear _
Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Campaigning in California for two days before the primary, Bush
previewed his fall strategy, repeatedly portraying the
Massachusetts governor as a liberal likely to advocate tax
increases.
   ``Michael Dukakis said he would not rule out a tax increase,''
Bush said. ``I'll rule it out.''
   For Dukakis, Jackson remained an unpredictable figure in an
otherwise smooth road to party unity. Commanding the loyalty of
black voters who are a critical part of the Democratic Party's
coalition, Jackson will have more than 1,000 delegates at the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. Dukakis predicted there
would be ``a floor fight or two'' over platform issues, but none
that would split the party.
   Both Bush and Dukakis hit rough spots on their drives for the
presidential nominations of their parties.
   On the ropes when the campaign reached New Hampshire, he staged
a comeback that shattered Dole's hopes for a quick knockout. Then
on March 8, Super Tuesday, Bush swept 16 primaries and effectively
ended the Republican contest.
   For Dukakis, the race started according to plan with a credible
third-place finish in Iowa and a strong victory in New Hampshire.
Victories in Texas and Florida on Super Tuesday established his
credentials as more than a regional candidate from the Northeast,
but he stumbled in Illinois and again in Michigan.
   However, Dukakis then put together the string of victories that
quieted such speculation and put him in command of the race.
   In the final contests, Dukakis defeated Jackson by margins of
better than 2 to 1 in New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana. Returns
from California were putting him ahead in that state by a
comparable margin.
   In New Jersey, with returns from 99 percent of the precincts
counted, Dukakis had 405,639 or 63 percent. Jackson had 209,762, or
33 percent. With 100 percent counted, Bush had 236,140 for 94
percent.
   In New Mexico, with returns from 97 percent of the precincts, it
was Dukakis 109,957 or 61 percent, to Jackson's 49,797 or 28
percent. Bush had 78 percent of the vote, translating into 65,733
votes from 97 percent of the precincts.
   In Montana, with returns from 99 percent of the precincts,
Dukakis had 82,034, or 69 percent. Jackson had 26,571, or 22
percent. Bush had 73 percent, or 62,395 votes.
   In California, with 97 percent of the precincts counted, Dukakis
had 1,798,759 or 61 percent. Jackson had 1,049,895 or 35 percent.
Bush had 83 percent, or 1,840,053.

   Jordan's King Hussein unconditionally
supported the Palestine Liberation Organization today and asked
oil-rich Arab states to help pay for the continuing struggle
against Israel.
   On the second day of the Arab summit, Hussein disclaimed any
ambition to restore Jordanian rule in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank. He insisted that the PLO must represent the Palestinian
people at any future international peace conference.
   Speaking behind closed doors to the leaders of the PLO and 20
Arab nations, Hussein endorsed some aspects of Secretary of State
George Shultz's Middle East peace plan, but declared:
   ``The United States has no Middle East policy other than support
for Israel. The U.S. approach to the problem of the Arab-Israeli
conflict is, unfortunately, based on a policy of crisis-management.
   ``The United States takes no political steps or initiatives
unless there has been a recent eruption in the region taking on the
aspect of a war.''
   Hussein said Arab nations should support the Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ``in an organized and
effective manner and ensure that it continues until it achieves its
objectives.''
   Copies of Hussein's comments were made available by the
Jordanian delegation.
   Hussein, who has been lukewarm in his support for the PLO in the
past, repeatedly stressed his wholehearted acceptance of the
guerrilla organization as ``the sole legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.''
   The three-day Arab League meeting was convened to support the
Palestinian uprising, which began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip Dec. 8.
   In Jerusalem today, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres mocked
the Arab leaders for supporting the uprising. ``There is nothing
more fractious for the Arab people than their show of unity,'' he
said.
   ``Are they really united around the intefadeh?'' Peres asked in
parliament, using the Arabic word for uprising. ``Do they mean to
say Iran and Iraq are fighting a war over the intefadeh and that in
Lebanon all the factions are also fighting over the intefadeh? What
kind of show is this?''
   PLO leader Yassir Arafat, wearing his usual ``kefiyeh''
headscarf and battle fatigues, told the Arab leaders on Tuesday
that ``our people swear before you to continue the struggle and the
intefadeh until victory.''
   He reiterated the PLO's determination to create a sovereign
Palestinian state ``with Jerusalem as its capital.'' Israel has
proclaimed Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state and pledged
never to give up any part of it.
   The summit's opening session Tuesday was marked by the walkout
of the Iranian ambassador to Algeria. Algerian newspapers carried
many pages of detailed coverage of the summit, but there was no
mention of the Iranian ambassador's walkout.
   The ambassador, Zargar Yaghoubi, abruptly rose from his seat in
the diplomats' section and walked out of the hall during an address
by Chedli Klibi, Tunisian Secretary General of the Arab League.
   ``While speaking on the intefadeh for which we meet we cannot
ignore the victory of brother Iraq, which has recovered its
territories, notably the Faw peninsula,'' Klibi said.
   ``Iraq has always been prepared to cooperate with international
peace efforts, while Iran's leaders are determined to pursue the
war'' which increasingly threatens neighboring Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, Klibi declared.
   A spokesman for the Iranian Embassy confirmed that Yaghoubi
walked out of the opening session ``in protest against incorrect
statements'' on the 7-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is one of the few top Arab
leaders not present at the summit. He sent a high-level delegation,
but said he was too busy with the war to come to Algiers.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the June 1967 Six-Day War. Since anti-Israeli riots began
on Dec. 8, more than 200 Palestinians and two Israelis have been
killed.

   Ladbroke's, one of London's leading bookmakers,
today made Democrat Michael Dukakis the favorite to beat Republican
George Bush in the U.S. presidential election in November.
   Ladbroke's made Dukakis the 8-11 favorite, which means if you
bet $11 and Dukakis wins, you get $8 plus your original stake. Bush
was given even odds, which means if you bet $1, you win a dollar
and get back your $1 stake.
   The Massachusetts governor on Tuesday won Democratic primaries
in California, Montana, New Jersey and New Mexico and has more than
enough committed delegates to win the party's nomination for
president.

   The party's over for Connections, Illinois Bell's
party-line service.
   Bell disconnected the year-old service Tuesday, saying callers
repeatedly violated guidelines. The company filed a formal request
with the Commerce Commission to end Connections, which provided
conversation lines for groups of up to nine people, company
spokesman Tim Bannon said.
   ``However, it became clear that a small number of Connections
callers abused the service, ignored the guidelines and used the
service in ways we had not intended,'' said Robert Ligett, Bell
general manager for residence marketing.
   Bannon said that despite warnings from monitors of the service,
callers exchanged names and telephone numbers. Obscene
conversations also were reported to Bell.
   Connections was one of dozens of services offered on the 900
telephone network. Party-line services operated by independent
companies are not affected by Bell's action, the company said.
   After Connections began, with an initial charge to the customer
of 20 cents for the first minute and 8 cents for each succeeding
minute, the independent companies began offering their services at
higher rates.
   Party lines came under fire early this year when some parents
complained about huge telephone bills incurred by their teen-agers.
Under pressure, Bell began waiving those bills.

   President Reagan got Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev to autograph Gorbachev's picture on the cover of Time
magazine at the request of a White House aide who was seeking it
for a friend, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Fitzwater was asked at his daily news briefing about a report by
the Soviet press agency Tass that before leaving Moscow Reagan
showed Gorbachev a copy of the magazine cover depicting him as
``The Man of the Year'' and asked him to autograph it and that
Gorbachev complied.
   A New York Times account of the Tass report was reproduced in a
full-page advertisement for Time that appeared in today's editions
of the Times.
   The White House spokesman at first said that a member of the
staff had requested the autograph for a friend who collects
autographed pictures. He said this request was sent to Moscow by
mail before the summit and he did not believe the president was
involved.
   After the briefing, however, Fitzwater sought out reporters to
give them a corrected account.
   He said that Kenneth M. Duberstein, deputy White House chief of
staff, asked Reagan if he could get the magazine cover autographed
as a favor for a friend and the president did so. He said the
incident occurred immediately after the formal farewell ceremony in
Moscow.
   Duberstein could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Fitzwater also said that about a dozen copies of the magazine
cover were sent separately to Moscow through diplomatic channels
with a request that they be autographed by Gorbachev for
distribution by Reagan as gifts to people involved in the summit.

<HEAD>Widow Wins Right To Sue TWA Over Cremated Husband's Lost Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airline passenger who was forced to send
her husband's ashes through the baggage check-in rather than carry
them aboard won the right to sue Trans World Airlines for damages
after the luggage was lost.
   Dorothy T. Coughlin, 67, had sued TWA for $78,000 in 1985, but a
federal judge ruled the airline was liable for only $1,250 under a
tariff limitation.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision
Tuesday and ruled that Coughlin's case should go to trial.
   The ashes were lost after a flight to Boston, where her husband
had wanted the remains buried in his family plot.
   ``He's still missing,'' said Coughlin's lawyer, Marc Levine.
``It was devastating to her. ... Can you imagine the embarrassment
and grief of literally losing your husband?''
   The appeals court ruled that a TWA ticket agent violated airline
policy by telling Coughlin she had to pack the cremated remains in
her suitcase. Airline policy says valuables should be carried
aboard.
   As a result, the airline can't expect to be protected by the
$1,250 liability limit, said the court.
   ``The cremated remains were unquestionably valuable, and there
is nothing in the record to suggest carriage of human ashes on
board was prohibited,'' they wrote.
   TWA's lawyer, James M. Derr, was out of town and could not be
reached for comment.

   The Columbian, Vancouver, Wash., on the Reagan-Gorbachev summit:
   Experts, observers, officials and others in the instant-wisdom
business are generally clustering under a consensus that the
recently concluded summit meetings in Moscow didn't produce much of
weight or import. ...
   Was the summit therefore not worth the considerable cost,
intense public attention and persistent anxiety that something
might go awry? ...
   Although the speeches (Reagan) had read earlier in Helsinki and
other stops on the trip toward the Kremlin were out of the old
mold, the president (saw) a new and different world in the faces of
actual Soviet citizens. ...
   Fortunately for the survival of humankind, the president got
nearer the truth when he predicted that the United States and the
Soviet Union would not go to war if the youth of both nations could
meet and mingle and get to know one another. ...
   The conversations between Reagan and Gorbachev upset the tough
guys in both camps, but the rest of us are justified in sleeping a
little easier.

   Fergus Falls (Minn.) Daily Journal on the Reagan-Gorbachev
summit:
   It was something many Americans never expected to see: President
Reagan, standing in the Kremlin, saying he no longer considered the
Soviet Union to be the ``evil empire.''
   That description of the Soviet Union, made by Reagan five years
ago, has characterized U.S.-Soviet negotiations since that time.
   Reagan and Gorbachev did not emerge from their four days of
meetings with major breakthroughs on major issues, such as arms
control.
   But some events were impressive nonetheless, such as the
Soviets' willingness to consider discussion of human rights.
   Every summit need not conclude with grand results; in fact,
there is as much danger is being rushed into agreements on arms
control as there is in delaying them.
   It's not unreasonable for leaders to first talk, then reach
agreements later.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on Reagan and Indians:
   President Reagan displayed both his ignorance about American
Indians and his ineptitude during a talk with students in the
Soviet Union.
   Sadly, he is not alone with those traits among his immigrant
compatriots in the United States. ...
   Reagan said that allowing Indians to maintain their culture on
reservations might have been a mistake.
   ``Maybe we should not have humored them in that, wanting to stay
in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said:
`No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us,''' the
president said.
   The remark understandably irritated Indian leaders. Indians, of
course, officially have been citizens since 1924 by an act of
Congress.

<HEAD>Court: In a Marriage, Private Talks Must Remain Private</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Husbands and wives may not testify in court about
their private conversations, even when both agree to do so and when
it would help their cause, Massachusetts' highest court ruled.
   In a unanimous ruling Tuesday that rejected a medical
malpractice claim, the Massachusetts Supreme Court also upheld the
common-law doctrine that prevents husbands and wives from repeating
in public what they said to each other in private.
   The justices called the rule outmoded and said they were
upholding it reluctantly, only because state law left them no
choice.
   The decision came in an appeal of a case in Middlesex Superior
Court in which a jury exonerated Dr. Garry A. Goldstein from
charges of medical malpractice brought by John Gallagher, a former
Natick resident, on behalf of his wife.
   Haline Gallagher suffered a cereberal hemorrhage in 1981 that
left her brain damaged and nearly quadriplegic. In his suit,
Gallagher charged that his wife's condition was the result of the
doctor's faulty diagnosis.
   At trial, the doctor testified that Mrs. Gallagher described her
headache as ``moderate.'' Her husband wished to testify that she
told him otherwise, but he was not allowed to take the stand.
   ``It's a tragedy,'' Gallagher's attorney, Jan Schlichtmann,
said. ``The court had the opportunity to correct a tragic
injustice.''
   Schlichtmann noted that if the Gallaghers had been living
together outside of marriage or if they had been divorced,
Gallagher could have testified.
   Under a state law enacted in 1851, any person ``of sufficient
understanding'' may testify, except for criminal defendants who
choose not to testify and a few other cases. Among them, the law
says, ``neither husband nor wife shall testify as to private
conversations with the other.''
   The court said the law means that contents of private
conversations are ``absolutely excluded.''
   Citing a scholarly law article, the court said there were five
reasons for the rule, including that a married couple has only one
interest, so no point would be served by having one spouse testify
for or against the other, and that a spouse has a ``bias of
affection'' and would not testify truthfully.
   According to Schlichtmann, Gallagher is a retired postal
inspector who has moved to Las Vegas, Nev., where he helps provide
the elaborate nursing care his wife requires.

   Westerly (R.I.) Sun drug seizures on the high seas:

traces of marijuana aboard.
   There was more grumping ... when the charter yacht Monkey

tiniest scraps of any illegal drug. ...
   In their eagerness, ... authorities overreacted (and) ignored
the cherished principle that punishment should fit the crime.
   Common sense has come to the rescue. Under new guidelines,
possession of small amounts of drugs will no longer result in
seizure. ...

   The Miami Herald on the drug war:
   The drug war has two main fronts, both extremely evil.
   At one end, drug consumption is corroding values of American
society. At the other end, drug trafficking is undermining
democratic institutions in supplier nations.
   Colombia is losing its war to a deadly combination of drug
trafficking and a violent leftist insurgency. Government officials,
judges, journalists and law enforcement officers often have had to
choose between death and surrender.
   In choosing surrender, they have increased traffickers' power
incalculably. ...
   The Reagan administration should call upon all nations of the
hemisphere to join the United States in a task force against drugs.
   This group should assess the mutual threat calmly, without
recriminations as to whether U.S. consumers or Latin American drug
suppliers are most to blame for the crisis.
   Then it should devise a common strategy _ diplomatic, military
and judicial _ for fighting the drug menace in unison.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on air travel safety:
   Air travel is remarkably safe in this country. That doesn't mean
it can't be improved.
   One reasonable way to do that is a proposed Federal Aviation
Agency rule which would mandate better seats on airliners.
   As you may have noticed, present accommodations are not exactly
top-notch. And in crash landings, seats often break loose, clogging
the aisles and resulting in increased deaths and injuries.
   The FAA's plan is to require replacement of all seats over the
next seven years, costing $33 million in all, or $7,200 per plane.
That's less than the price of a compact car _ and well worth it.

   They don't want schools to preach, but teach _ an academic
approach to religion that's part of any healthy intellectual
endeavor. ...
   In restricting prayer in the classroom and turning down
creationism laws, the courts never meant to outlaw discussions
about religions. They meant to exclude only narrow definitions of
religion that give emphasis to one religion over another. ...
   These guidelines attempt to encourage the academic pursuit of
understanding religion that should always be welcome.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on George Bush's budget plan:
   In his quest to be more than an echo of President Reagan, George
Bush has managed only a shade of difference on taxes and spending.
   In 1980, Reagan made such specific campaign promises, notably a
defense buildup and a huge tax cut, that everybody knew he couldn't
keep his promise to balance the budget in 1983.
   Bush, who is promising a balanced budget for 1993 while vowing
to cut taxes and increase some spending along the way, has stayed
vague enough to sound almost plausible.
   (But) in its theme of painless gain, Bush's semi-secret plan to
end the deficit suggests alchemy, the ancient hope of making gold
from cheap metals.
   That was a hard trick to pull off, and so is Bush's plan for
balancing the budget with tax cuts and higher spending.

   Proposed federal legislation that would require banks to cash
government-issued checks to the elderly and the poor should get a
quick endorsement from our representatives in the House and Senate.
   Peggy Miller, representing the Consumer Federation of America,
recently told a Senate subcommittee considering the legislation
that check cashing agencies and unlicensed community locations take
as much as 30 percent in ``fees'' to cash a personal check.
   Bankers representative August Zinsser III contended the proposal
``is premature, inappropriate and unfair to depository
institution.'' Zinsser also charged the concept would subject banks
to large fraud losses.
   Nonsense. ... The fraud rate is far below that of personal
drafts.
   Zinsser's comments suggest that banks don't want to get involved
simply because there is no financial gain for them.

   Stevens Point (Wis.) Journal on the Great Lakes water level:
   Not so long ago, people were worried ... about the rising levels
of the Great Lakes and the damage this was doing to buildings and
other things along the shores. ...
   All sorts of emergency measures were being proposed to lower the
levels before Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland disappeared beneath
the waves.
   After all, there was evidence that the lakes had been several
feet higher some centuries earlier, and there was speculation that
that might have been the ``normal'' level.
   Some skeptics suggested that steps to lower the lakes might be
risky and ineffective. ...
   In the meantime, the skeptics suggested, wet weather might taper
off and the problem could correct itself.
   In the paper recently there have been stories that said, in
effect, that the problem has corrected itself, at least as far as
Lakes Superior and Michigan are concerned, and the level has
dropped so far that navigation in channels and harbors is posing
some difficulties. ...

alarms China. Vietnam also costs the Soviet Union billions of
dollars in annual subsidies.
   Its economy is a shambles, its inflation legendary and its
political leadership in disarray. Agriculture is so dreadful in the
northern, more Communist, part of the country that Hanoi says three
million Vietnamese are near starvation.
   That is the context in which Hanoi announced that it would
withdraw 50,000 troops from occupied Cambodia this year, and the
remaining 50,000 to 75,000 by 1990. It also pledged to withdraw
troops from Laos. ...
   Whether the pullout is genuine remains to be seen. But Moscow
wants it. ...
   ``Cambodianization'' of Cambodia's security problem is probably
possible. The Vietnamese and government forces have succeeded
pretty well in driving Khmer Rouge and right-wing insurgents across
the Thai border. ...
   Vietnam should not only be compelled, but allowed, to keep its
word about troop withdrawal. Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian
people would all benefit.

   A Florida minister with a national
television program has been elected moderator of the General
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in America.
   More than 700 church delegates, making up the delegaton's
governing body, convened in Knoxville on Tuesday to begin
discussing committee reports and conduct general sessions. The
convention ends Friday.
   D. James Kennedy, senior minister of Coral Ridge Presbyterian
Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was elected moderator. Kennedy,
whose church has about 7,000 members, succeeds Gerald Sovereign of
Gulf Breeze, Fla., who is retiring.
   The denomination split from the Presbyterian Church in the
United States in the early 1970s. It has since grown from 240
churches to more than 1,000, officials said.

   A woman whose husband was convicted of
theft refused to pay a fine to free him, then told the court she
had fallen in love with a prosecution witness, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   The incident occurred Monday in Swazi National Court, the Times
of Swaziland said.
   The defendant, Themba Shonge, was convicted of stealing a tape
recorder. His wife, after refusing to pay a fine which would have
spared Shonge a jail term, told the court she had fallen in love
with a prosecution witness _ the owner of a repair shop where her
husband had taken the stolen item.
   The jilted Shonge broke down and cried as he was led away to
serve a seven-month sentence, the newspaper said.

   Harrods department store said Wednesday it is
investigating a newspaper's allegations that some saleswomen were
selling sex to customers.
   In a front-page story, the tabloid Daily Mirror claimed that
women selling perfume at the fashionable Knightsbridge store were
earning up to $1,800 a night, mainly from wealthy customers who
slipped them their phone numbers.
   ``These are very serious allegations and we are now holding a
full investigation into the situation,'' said Harrods spokesman
Andrew Wiles.
   He said the saleswomen at the perfume counters were not directly
employed by Harrods, but worked for agencies and often moved
between top London department stores.
   Harrods, which boasts that it can provide everything from the
cradle to the grave, is a favorite shopping haunt of Princess Diana
and holds royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and most other
members of the royal family.
   Founded in 1849 by grocer Henry Harrod, the store has been owned
since 1985 by Egyptian entrepreneur Mohamed Fayed and his two
brothers.

<HEAD>Simon Finally Endorses Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon finally jumped on the Michael
Dukakis bandwagon Wednesday, formally ending his own dormant quest
for the Democratic presidential nomination and nudging his
remaining delegates toward the certain nominee.
   The Illinois senator, who had already seen roughly 40 of his 184
delegates defect in the past month, promised to ``do everything I
can'' to get Dukakis elected.
   ``The primaries and caucuses are now history. The verdict is
in,'' said Simon. Dukakis ``clearly is more sensitive to the
fundamental needs of our nation'' than George Bush.
   In a bow to supporters of another Illinois hopeful, Jesse
Jackson, who were angered when Simon suspended his campaign in
April instead of ending it, the senator said only, ``I will urge
delegates who have no strong commitment in any other direction to
vote for Michael Dukakis.''
   He said the Massachusetts governor's ``greatest asset was that
he was himself. He didn't try to become something else. He's
genuine. He's not phony. I think somehow that came across.''
   Echoing themes he built his own campaign around, Simon said,
``Michael Dukakis has to make clear ... that he has a positive
program of jobs, for quality education, for long-term care, for
moving away from the arms race, for things our party traditionally
has stood for.''
   ``I want to use whatever influence I have for the causes that my
delegates and I support,'' he said.
   He said he supports Jackson's call for language in the
Democratic platform denouncing South Africa as a terrorist state, a
position Dukakis has been reluctant to take.
   Simon suspended his faltering campaign on April 7 instead of
ending it because ``I thought it would be a brokered convention,''
he explained.
   That prospect quickly evaporated. ``Conventional wisdom has
conventionally been wrong on just about everything,'' said Simon.
   Speaking at a news conference at Democratic National Committee
headquarters, he said the party was more unified than at any time
since 1964.
   He said he was 99 percent certain his first run for the
presidency was also his last. Simon, who is up for re-election in
1990, said, ``I don't want to be a Harold Stassen'' _ a reference
to the perennial candidate from Minnesota.
   Simon expressed little interest in the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Jackson has earned consideration, but the vice presidency is not
``a blue ribbon or a red ribbon you give to someone who comes in
second in a race,'' he said.
   Simon's hopes were buoyed by a close finish behind Richard
Gephardt in Iowa's caucuses last February. He finished third in New
Hampshire, but sat out the Super Tuesday primaries across the South
and never recovered.
   He encountered skepticism about how he would juggle his promised
public works, education and long-term care progams with a pledge to
balance the budget in three years.
   Simon's campaign is $450,000 in debt, spokesman David Carle said.

   Michael Dukakis said Wednesday ``I'm going to
cast my net far and wide'' for a Democratic running mate, with
Jesse Jackson just one of those who will be considered.
   Dukakis, who clinched the presidential nomination by sweeping
the final four Democratic primaries on Tuesday, told reporters,
``It's the 8th of June. The process of selecting a running mate
will begin.''
   Jackson has been saying ever more clearly that he feels his
second-place primary-campaign finish has earned him first chance at
the vice presidential spot. He underlined that Wednesday, saying,
``Consideration does mean an offer; it does not mean just in
passing.''
   Dukakis said at a news conference that Jackson ``deserves
consideration ... but there are other people to be considered as
well, and it's up to the nominee to make that selection.''
   ``This is a decision the nominee has to make,'' he told
reporters at his hotel before leaving for home.
   The Massachusetts governor called his successful campaign a
``steady march to the nomination'' and said it had included a
``remarkable run of victories.''
   He was to stop in St. Louis on the way home to pick up the
formal support of a vanquished rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
Earlier in the day, another former presidential foe, Sen. Paul
Simon of Illinois, gave his endorsement in Washington.
   Dukakis took several jabs at his likely November opponent,
Republican George Bush, during the Los Angeles news conference. In
particular, he took issue with the vice president's comparing this
year's general election race to what Bush said was the clear choice
in 1972 between Democrat George McGovern and Republican Richard
Nixon.
   ``I heard a lot of labels yesterday,'' Dukakis said. ``I think
it's a very serious mistake to run that kind of campaign.'' He said
it was ``absurd'' to compare this year to 1972.
   ``This race is about the '90s'' he said. ``It's about the
future.''
   Dukakis said the most important factor in choosing a vice
presidential candidate would be to pick someone who would be a good
president if needed.
   He said he would select a running mate through ``a good,
thoughtful, deliberative process'' and hoped to have ``a very good
idea'' of who that will be before the Democratic National
Convention in July.
   Dukakis said he did not know whether he would have personal
interviews with potential running mates.
   Asked if a woman was on his list, Dukakis said, ``There's no
list at present.''
   He repeated his statement that there are no ``deep and dividing
issues in our party,'' and said he had no ideological litmus test
for a running mate.
   ``I'm not looking for a clone of Michael Dukakis. I'm looking
for someone who will do the job well and be an asset to the
ticket,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he hopes ``to be in as many states as possible''
during the fall campaign but stopped short of promising he'd visit
each one.
   Asked if he expected to receive Jackson's support, Dukakis said,
``Yes, I do.''
   He said he spoke with Jackson Tuesday night and agreed to talk
further. ``He congratulated me and I congratulated him,'' he said.

   A defense lawyer argued today that the
drowning of a Navy recruit during training March 2 was an accident
and suggested higher authorities were to blame for poor supervision
of the program.
   Retired Capt. Ferdinand Salomon, representing Lt. Thomas A.
Torchia, led off closing arguments in a hearing to determine
whether his client, commander of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School,
and five enlisted instructors should face court-martial in the
death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki.
   ``It was a tragic accident,'' Salomon said. ``This unfortunate
incident has been blown out of all proportion by the media. Some
good is going to come of this, but not by pillorying the fine young
man at this table.''
   The lawyer argued at the military proceeding that the Navy has
refused repeated requests to release reports on the last two
inspections made of the school, in 1983 and 1986. Torchia took
command earlier this year.
   ``Why? Does the Navy have something to hide?'' Salomon asked.
``Did they find everything wonderful at the school ... or did they
just forget about the school entirely?''
   He said that rescue swimmers are an elite group and that higher
authorities should have had interest in their training.
   Torchia is charged with dereliction of duty, and the five
instructors _ Petty Officers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and David
J. Smith and Petty Officers 2nd Class John W. Zelenock, Frankie D.
Deaton and Michael W. Combe _ are accused of involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy.
   The instructors are accused of forcing the 19-year-old recruit
from Appleton, Wis., into the water when he tried to quit the
course a second time.
   A pathologist said Mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under
water and was scared to death.
   On Tuesday, the final witness, John W. Singer, the school's top
chief petty officer, testified that Mirecki was allowed to resume
the water rescue course without taking a required medical exam.
   ``You cannot legally return to training status until that
physical is held,'' Singer told the investigating officer, Cmdr.
Daniel J. D'Alesio Jr.
   Mirecki initially asked to drop out of the course a month before
his death. A flight surgeon diagnosed the phobia and found him
unfit for training, but a psychologist subsequently disagreed.
   Mirecki, who later asked he be reinstated in the course, was
erroneously restored to the training on the basis of the
psychologist's finding but without the required physical and the
flight surgeon's approval, testimony disclosed.
   Prosecutors on Tuesday also introduced training records in an
effort to show Torchia and the instructors knew or should have
known about Mirecki's phobia and psychological examination.
   Conway testified that the records were available to the
defendants in the school's office and that Blevins had signed a
counseling sheet including comments by Mirecki.
   The recruit wrote that when he was 5 years old, his brother
threw him in the water and had to rescue him. ``I don't want to go
through that again,'' Mirecki wrote.

   The demonstration launch of the Ariane-4 rocket
that was delayed by mechanical and computer problems has been
rescheduled for June 15, officials announced Wednesday.
   A statement released by Arianespace, the commercial arm of the
European Space Agency, said repairs on the rocket were completed at
the launch site in Kourou, French Guiana.
   The repair work between the payload and launcher sections of the
rocket involved rewiring an adapter. A new on-board computer was
fitted in the vehicle equipment bay and tested, the statement said.
   Ariane-4, designed to serve as the space agency's new workhorse,
will carry three satellites into orbit _ a European weather
satellite, and two telecommunications satellites, including one for
the American company Pan American Satellite.
   The launch also is designed as a demonstration for future
customers of the rocket's versatility and power.

<HEAD>Group Claims Massive Radiation Contamination Around Nuclear
Weapons Plants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs penultimate graf to restore Resnikoff's first name.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study group says an independent
oversight agency for the nation's 16 major nuclear weapons plants
should be created because mismanagement has allowed radioactive
contamination of air, soil and water.
   The Radioactive Waste Campaign, a self-styled public interest
group based in New York City, made the recommendation in a letter
to members of Congress. The letter was released the same day the
group released a 170-page report which charged there are dangerous
levels of radioactive pollution at all 16 of the Energy
Department's main production facilities for nuclear weapons.
   The two-year study by nine researchers concluded there is ``a
pattern of gross mismanagement by the department, which is allowing
radioactivity to leak out of the sites through soil, water and air
_ in many cases intentionally.''
   Many of the problems cited by the report have long been
acknowledged by the Energy Department and have been the subjects of
several blistering reviews by the General Accounting Office. But
the independent study is the most wide-ranging report yet published
on the issue and suggests cleanup costs will exceed the Energy
Department's estimate of $100 billion.
   The Energy Department referred calls on the subject to the
office of an official who was not immediately available for comment
Tuesday.
   Among key examples of contamination cited by the report:
   _At the Hanford Reservation in southeastern Washington, billions
of gallons of radioactive water are routinely pumped into the
ground each year. An underground plume of radioactivity stretches
six miles to the Columbia River, one of the world's premier salmon
runs and an irrigation source for two states.
   _At the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, millions of
gallons of radioactive fluids are poured into seepage basins
actually designed to leak at a steady rate. Strontium-90, which can
cause bone cancer and leukemia, is entering surface water at rates
43,000 times above the government's standard for drinking water.
The report charges further that Atlanta's water supply is
threatened by toxic chemicals from the site.
   _At the Feed Material Production Center in Fernald, Ohio,
uranium is contaminating suburban Cincinnati's water supply.
   _At the Nevada Test Site, underground nuclear explosions are
contaminating underground water supplies, and radioactive fallout
has drifted as far as Salt Lake City.
   _Plutonium, one of the most carcinogenic materials known, has
been dispersed into the air or water at weapons facilities near
Dayton, Ohio; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Denver.
   _At Oak Ridge, Tenn., where three plants are based, ``35 million
pounds of uranium are sitting in the ground, so there's uranium in
the runoff in streams and a large amount of uranium put into the
air,'' Resnikoff said. That's the largest store of uranium anywhere
in the country, he said.
   The group, in its letter to Congress, also called for an
immediate halt to dumping of radioactive wastes into the ground,
and urged the weapons sites be given top priority for clean-up. It
also called for creation of an independent oversight agency for the
weapons plants.
   The 16 sites covered by the study are:
   _Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C.
   _Three facilities at Oak Ridge, Tenn.: The Y-12 plant, Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant.
   _Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Portsmouth, Ohio.
   _Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio.
   _Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio.
   _Paducah, Ky., Gaseous Diffusion Plant.
   _Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Texas.
   _Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N.M.
   _Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, N.M.
   _Rocky Flats Plant outside Denver.
   _Nevada Test Site about 100 miles from Las Vegas, Nev.
   _Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif.
   _Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho.
   _Hanford Reservation in Hanford, Wash.
   Marvin Resnikoff, a nuclear physicist, said the nine who
performed the study reviewed several hundred Energy Department
documents and visited some of the sites.
   The Radioactive Waste Campaign issues a quarterly newspaper that
is sent to 13,000 members. It has five full-time staff members and
some part-time workers, Resnikoff said.

   Actress Betty Buckley sang ``They Can't Take
That Away from Me'' at a Shubert Theater service Wednesday for
George Rose, an actor killed May 4 at his vacation home in the
Dominican Republic.
   ``George Rose was a teacher of mine. He was the epitome of
elegance and high standards. I can only aspire to his standards,''
said Miss Buckley, who was a star with Rose in ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood.''
   Rose, 68, was born in England but lived since 1961 in New York,
nearly always working on Broadway. He won Tony Awards as the
chairman in ``Drood'' and as Doolittle in a revival of ``My Fair
Lady.''
   Rupert Holmes, who composed ``Drood,'' said, ``His presence was
a beam that lifts the ceiling of theater.'' Maureen McGovern, who
played Rose's daughter for a year in ``The Pirates of Penzance,''
sang a vocalise by Faure which was a particular favorite of the
actor.
   Actor Jack Gilford said, ``I never failed to marvel at Rose's
honesty, depth, humor, skill and charm.'' Judy Kaye, who won a Tony
on Sunday for ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' called Rose ``one of
the best actors who ever walked the planet.''
   Howard McGillan, who was in ``Drood'' and now is in ``Anything
Goes,'' sang ``It's De-Lovely.'' Larry Kert, who said he and Rose
walked their dogs together for 17 years, sang ``Anyone Can
Whistle.''

<HEAD>Firm Offers to Pay 125 for Pro Bono Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City's biggest law firm has announced a
$10 million program to place lawyers just out of law school in
public service organizations, where they will represent the poor in
civil cases.
   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom said Tuesday that it will
pay the salaries of 125 young lawyers willing to spend their first
two years after law school working for the poor.
   ``This will tend to contradict the view that the established bar
has about large law firms, the view that we take from society and
do not give back,'' said an executive partner, Peter P. Mullen.
``We have been successful, and we have made money, and we have
decided to put some of it back.''
   The program also will instill in the lawyers a taste for pro
bono _ public benefit _ work, said Mullen.
   Last year Skadden, Arps was reported by The American Lawyer to
have had the highest earnings of the nation's law firms. Founded 40
years ago, it has 177 partners and 675 associates and offices in
seven U.S. cities, London and Tokyo.
   Unlike criminal defendants, poor people who are deprived of
civil or human rights are not guaranteed counsel by the
Constitution.
   The program will take the form of fellowships that pay about
$32,500 a year plus fringe benefits, comparable to second-year
salaries of federal judicial clerks, said Skadden, Arps. The firm
will also help repay student loans.
   Beginning associates at Skadden, Arps earn more than $70,000 a
year. Entering lawyers in legal-services offices earn an average of
slightly more than $25,000.
   Twenty-five lawyers, starting next June, will be named each year
for the next five years. The lawyers will be under no obligation to
return to the firm.

   The government called off the search

15 days ago.
   ``There is nothing more to do. We have searched in all areas
where the plane could have possibly fallen,'' Oscar Melendez, the
deputy minister for transportation and construction said at a news
conference Tuesday.
   The DC-6 cargo plane, operated by the government-run Aeronica
company, disappeared May 24 en route to Managua from Panama on a
routine supply run. The last word from the crew came 1{ hours after
takeoff in a radio message that said ``all is normal,'' according
to the newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   A search began shortly after the plane was reported missing.
Costa Rican and Panamanian planes and boats joined the Nicaraguan

   Protesters occupying a plot of land near the
Berlin Wall used slingshots to shoot stones and steel balls at West
Berlin police early Wednesday, injuring one of the officers,
authorities said.
   Since May 25 about 60 environmentalists have been occupying the
site, known as the Lenne Triangle, which is on the West Berlin side
of the wall but is owned by communist East Berlin.
   They are protesting plans to build a street through the area
once the site is handed over to West Berlin on July 1 under an
agreement to exchange small parcels of land near the wall.
   Some protesters stepped off the plot of land on Wednesday to
fire slingshots at officers, injuring one in the thigh, a police
spokesman said.
   Police responded with blasts from a water cannon and the
protesters retreated onto the triangle. West Berlin police cannot
legally step onto the property since it is still owned by East
Berlin.

when the cat returned home and leaped on her, severing a vein in
her leg, said Acting Inspector John Woodgate.
   Neighbors rushed to help as blood poured from the wound, but
Mrs. Edmunds lapsed into unconsciousness and died.
   Neighbors were caring for the cat on Wednesday.
   Chelmsford is 30 miles northeast of London.

   A black woman who has refused to testify about
her daughter's alleged abduction and rape by six whites sought
sanctuary in a church this morning to avoid arrest for contempt of
court.
   Glenda Brawley, her two attorneys and two bodyguards entered the
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Queens about 6 a.m., according to the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who also was with Mrs. Brawley.
   ``The Rev. Timothy Mitchell invited us to be here to seek
religious asylum and sanctuary,'' said C. Vernon Mason, one of Mrs.
Brawley's attorneys. ``We're prepared to stay here as long as it
takes.''
   Police made no immediate attempt to arrest Mrs. Brawley and were
nowhere to be seen outside the modern church, which dominates the
industrial neighborhood with its orange stained-glass spire and
stainless steel cross.
   ``We don't know what we're going to do yet,'' said Sgt. Ed
Burns, a police spokesman.
   The 33-year-old Mrs. Brawley ``will not answer the judge's call
or the attorney general's call,'' Sharpton said, reading from a
statement outside the church. ``She will answer a higher call
today.''
   However, Mrs. Brawley's attorneys backed off from their earlier
contention that police could not legally arrest Mrs. Brawley inside
a church.
   Andrew Schnier of the New York State Bar Association's criminal
justice section said there was no state or common law that would
preclude authorities from executing an arrest warrant inside a
religious institution.
   The front door to the church was guarded by a well-dressed man
who screened parishioners showing up to participate in the church's
day care and senior citizen programs. Reporters were turned away.
   Mrs. Brawley's daughter, Tawana, was found Nov. 28, four days
after she had disappeared. The 16-year-old was lying dazed in a
plastic bag in Wappingers Falls, about 10 miles south of
Poughkeepsie. Her hair had been shorn, animal excrement had been
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her
torso.
   She said she had been attacked by six white men, one of whom
flashed a police-like badge.
   Neither Miss Brawley nor her family has cooperated with
investigators or made public more details, claiming that state
officials are involved in a racially motivated cover-up.
   On Monday, Judge Angelo Ingrassia of Dutchess County sentenced
Mrs. Brawley to 30 days in jail and fined her $250 for defying a
grand jury subpoena to testify in an investigation led by state
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Authorities on Tuesday issued a statewide warrant for Mrs.
Brawley, saying she was ``fair game'' for arrest.
   Mrs. Brawley took sanctuary in a black church rather than appear
before a grand jury in Poughkeepsie this morning. Her daughter was
not at the church this morning.
   ``You don't mess with black people in their churches,'' said
Mrs. Brawley's sister Juanita.
   Sharpton this morning issued a direct challenge to Abrams,
saying, ``There's nothing legally stopping you from coming in here.
So show the nation the moral beast you are and come through these
doors and arrest her.''
   Abrams spokesman Tim Gilles said: ``Whether she's arrested
today, tomorrow, Glenda Brawley is no particular threat to public
safety or public order. If they (they sheriff's office) were to
wait a few days, we have no objection to that.''
   Abrams and Gilles were in Poughkeepsie where the grand jury
probe continued.
   Sharpton reiterated claims of a cover-up this morning and called
again for Abrams to step aside and for Gov. Mario Cuomo to appoint
a special prosecutor. He also hinted that Miss Brawley would
cooperate with an ``impartial prosecutor.''

<HEAD>U.S. Institute May Go `Offshore' with AIDS Research on Chimps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frustrated by a ban on importing chimpanzees,
U.S. officials are looking into shifting AIDS tests on the animals
to Africa and the Soviet Union, a move experts call a needless
death blow to the last chimps in the wild.
   ``This is very, very bad,'' said Jane Goodall, a leading
chimpanzee specialist who was recently in Washington to alert
legislators to the unannounced program. ``It is not a choice of
AIDS or chimps. Enough can be bred in captivity.''
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., a veterinarian, has threatened to
block such a move.
   The director of the National Institutes of Health, James
Wyngaarden, confirmed in an interview that the government agency is
considering AIDS research projects in Africa and the Soviet Union
because U.S. law bans importation of chimpanzees.
   ``We clearly don't want to get into an international fracas over
seeming to subvert rules that apply in this country,'' Wyngaarden
said. But, he added, ``we're taking lots of looks at Africa.''
   He provided no specifics. But confidential minutes obtained by
The Associated Press show that NIH decided quietly in March to
identify target groups of African chimpanzees and explore means of
using them in research.
   According to the minutes, an NIH committee decided to develop
``an African chimp field survey to provide us with the numbers of
animals, serological (blood) information and (their) condition.''
   Possible sites for research include a laboratory in Liberia
operated by the New York Blood Center and the Sukhumi center in
Soviet Georgia, which would have to import chimps, since
specialists say it now has none.
   Chimps, which were instrumental in developing a hepatitis B
vaccine, are valuable research subjects because their genetic
material varies less than 1 percent from man's. In current
research, scientists are injecting chimps with experimental
vaccines for AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Wyngaarden said NIH scientists want more chimpanzees than are
available, but are thwarted by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and
the 14-year-old Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species, a treaty that prohibits trade in animals threatened with
extinction.
   Experts fear that, once in Africa, researchers would have access
to chimpanzees smuggled illegally across borders from endangered
colonies, sometimes with false documentation.
   Goodall said new chimpanzee roundups, during which hunters often
kill adults in order to get at the young, ``would not only have a
devastating effect on chimpanzees but would bring them to
extinction.''
   An average of 10 mothers and babies are killed for every infant
chimp successfully exported, she said in a telephone interview from
England.
   Goodall and eight eminent American and European biomedical
experts wrote to Nature magazine saying that although chimpanzees
were essential to AIDS research, enough could be bred for
laboratory purposes.
   ``Going to Africa is no solution,'' said Marc Girard of the
Pasteur Institute in Paris. ``We must breed more, better use those
we have and find alternatives.''
   Geza Teleki, an American primatologist who heads a
Washington-based international specialist group, the Committee for
Conservation and Care of Chimpanzees, said too little has been done
to breed captive chimps.
   ``The bottom line is competition for the few chimpanzees still
hanging on in Africa and to hell with all the national and
international laws protecting them,'' Teleki contended,
   A 1978 chimpanzee census commissioned by NIH showed chimp
populations extinct or depleted across much of their traditional
African range. The unpublished census was made public recently by
Teleki an other specialists.
   Most chimpanzees in medical research originated in West Africa,
where their number has dropped this century from a million to about
17,000, Teleki said. Outside of West Africa, he said, only Zairean
and South African authorities control large groups of chimps.
   ``The NIH clearly intends to continue being an accomplice in
driving the species to extinction beyond the view of the American
public,'' Teleki asserted.
   Sen. Melcher said he opposed such a transfer of U.S. chimpanzee
research to Africa.
   ``NIH is going to have to abide by international agreement,''
Melcher said, warning that Congress could block any move
``offshore'' by inserting restrictions in NIH appropriations.
   The number of chimpanzees already used in U.S. research is in
dispute.
   Wyngaarden said only 400 to 600 chimps are available, and the
infant mortality is 30 percent in breeding centers used by NIH.
   But Jan Moor-Jankowski, director of Lemsip, a large
primate-research facility in New York, challenged the figures,
saying NIH has access to 800 animals, more than 100 are born each
year and that number could be increased.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Device Can Predict Which Cancers Will Spread</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A method previously used to help diagnose
cancer and other diseases also can predict the odds that cancer
cells from breast or colon tumors will spread through the body, a
researcher says.
   ``There are two big problems in cancer: early detection and,
when you've found a tumor, what is the prognosis,'' said chemist
Ian C.P. Smith, of the National Research Council in Ottawa, Canada.
   ``What I am reporting ... is the use of a chemical technique
that will help the medical profession with both of those
problems,'' said Smith, who outlined his findings Tuesday in
Toronto during the Third Chemical Congress of North America. The
Los Angeles Times reported Smith's findings Wednesday.
   If the technique shows a tumor will not spread, or metastasize,
the tumor can be surgically removed without the need for
debilitating radiation or chemotherapy, Smith said.
   It also might help doctors avoid unnecessary radical
mastectomies, in which surgeons remove a cancerous breast, lymph
nodes in the armpit and muscles linking the upper chest and
shoulder, he added.
   Doctors now make a subjective judgment about whether a cancer
will spread, based on the size of the tumor and the appearance of
tumor cells under a microscope.
   The method cited by Smith is known as nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, which is a variation on NMR imaging, also known
as magnetic resonance imaging.
   Despite their name, NMR imaging machines don't involve
radiation, as do X-ray machines, and produce images of much higher
quality. They have been used to detect tumors, subtle signs of
Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, and various disease
processes in the heart, liver and kidneys.
   Chemists have used NMR spectroscopy for more than 30 years to
determine the structure of molecules. When a chemical is placed in
the NMR device's powerful magnetic field and bombarded with
radio-frequency energy, scientists can deduce the structure of the
chemical by measuring which frequencies of energy are absorbed.
   Smith and Caroline E. Mountfors, of Australia's University of
Sydney, found rat tumors that got rid of the absorbed energy
extremely rapidly never metatasized, while those that shed the
energy slowly had a high probability of spreading to other sites in
the rats' bodies.
   Studies of breast and colon tumors removed from 167 patients at
Ottawa General Hospital and Ottawa Civic Hospital during the past
three years confirmed the value of the method, Smith said.
   There has been no spread of cancer in 25 patients whose tumors
shed absorbed energy quickly, while all the others _ whose excised
tumors got rid of energy slowly _ either had metastases at the time
of surgery or developed them later, he said.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi created an
uproar at the Arab Summit on Wednesday, accusing unidentified Arab
leaders of being ``lackeys of imperialism,'' conference sources
reported.
   Chedli Klibi, secretary general of the 21-member Arab League,
described the session as ``stormy.'' He declined to give details.
   Gadhafi distributed the text of a statement to the Arab leaders
before the start of Wednesday's closed session and then refused to
enter the meeting hall. The session was held in the closely guarded
Aurassi Hotel.
   Witnesses said the Libyan leader wore one white glove as he
walked up and down on a terrace of the hotel overlooking Algiers
harbor, while the chiefs of state were inside waiting for him to
join them.
   Members of the Libyan delegation explained that the glove was
``to avoid touching some of the other chiefs of state with whom he
may have to shake hands.''
   Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali went out on the
terrace to try to persuade Gadhafi to join the meeting but was
rebuffed, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Klibi then joined Gadhafi and finally persuaded him to come into
the meeting room. Arriving at his seat, the maverick Libyan leader
delivered an impromptu diatribe ``even more violent than his
prepared statement,'' the sources said.
   Details of his remarks or of the statement were not immediately
available. But sources said it accused some of the chiefs of state
at the summit of being ``lackeys of imperialism'' dedicated to
undermining the Arab cause.
   Gadhafi told the Libyan news agency JANA on the eve of the
summit that some of the Arab leaders, whom he did not name, were
attending the summit with ``explicit instructions from the U.S.
State Department.''
   The sources said some of the other leaders raised immediate
protests.
   ``We have no business beating about the bush,'' sources quoted
Gadhafi as saying. ``The one and only enemy of all the Arabs is the
United States.''
   Shortly before, King Hussein of Jordan told the summit of his
close relationship with the United States and his partial
endorsement of Secretary of State George P. Shultz's peace plan.
   Several members of other delegations expressed indignation at
Gadhafi's attack, but they refused to be quoted.
   The summit is ostensibly dedicated to achieving Arab unity on
material and financial support for the 6-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Before leaving Tripoli on Monday, Gadhafi said he would not
tolerate any divergence from this limited one-point agenda,
although several Arab leaders were determined to raise other issues
such as the war between Iran and Iraq.
   Several leaders, including King Hussein, have reiterated the
general Arab support for Iraq at the summit. The Iranian ambassador
to Algeria, Zargar Yaghoubi, walked out of the opening public
session of the three-day summit in protest of similar remarks by
Klibi.

   Federal officials have cited the Pacific
Engineering plant in Henderson for 123 health and safety violations
since 1974, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Wednesday.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration
released the records after the newspaper requested them under the
federal Freedom of Information Act.
   Connie Richardson, a spokeswoman for the company, said Pacific
Engineering would not comment.
   The plant was destroyed May 4 in a series of blasts that killed
two people, injured 326 and caused $73 million in property damage.
   A December 1975 inspection turned up 20 violations, including
use of an inappropriate truck in an area containing combustible
dust. A June 1983 inspection turned up 38 violations, including
failing to have water or a shower near anhydrous ammonia systems.
   A May 1983 inspection resulted in 30 violations, the biggest of
which was failing to mark the rated load of a crane.
   At least two inspections resulted from accidents at the plant.
   State officials have said the number of citations is
``moderate'' for a company of the size and activity of Pacific
Engineering.
   Meanwhile, Clark County Commissioners have endorsed a proposal
calling for changes in zoning regulations to provide the county
better control over hazardous materials. One target would be an
industrial complex at Henderson.
   The complex includes Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., which
manufactures the same rocket fuel oxidizer produced nearby at
Pacific Engineering. The two were the only plants in the country
that produced the critical rocket fuel oxidizer, used in the space
shuttle and military rockets.
   Federal officials have announced plans to pay the companies a
surcharge on the oxidizer to allow Kerr-McGee to expand and Pacific
Engineering to rebuild.
   Kerr-McGee halted production on the ammonium perchlorate May 12
pending safety studies. No start-up date has been announced.

   A student ``Soul Patrol'' has succeeded in
stopping neighborhood bullies from victimizing students outside a
middle school.
   The 25-member Soul Patrol was formed at Joy Middle School, in an
inner-city east side neighborhood.
   ``There used to be a time when there would be about 10 or 12
guys outside the school building waiting on kids to come outside so
they could jump them,'' William Howard, a Detroit Urban League
worker who established the program in 1986 after seeing a student
robbed, said recently.
   Each day, patrol in yellow jackets and caps patrol the school
grounds, using walkie-talkies and whistles. The students get help
from parents, Urban League volunteers and police Officer Anthony
Thompson, who is assigned to the school.
   ``Before the program started, I used to have to take in at least
one or two kids a day for delinquent behavior, but in the past few
months, I haven't had to take anyone in,'' Thompson said.

   An explosion and fire at a Chevron
refinery today injured up to six employees and shot flames 150 to
200 feet in the air, witnesses and officials said.
   A pump station caught fire about 9:40 a.m. and spread to some
small storage tanks nearby, Chevron spokesman Art Spencer said. The
pump station moves unfinished gasoline from the manufacturing
section to storage area, he said.
   ``There is concern for the fire spreading, but we do not feel it
will spread to the manufacturing section because it is divided'' by
a bayou and a highway, Spencer said.
   The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
   He said four workers were taken to Park Place Hospital. The
injuries, he said, were not serious. However, a hospital
spokeswoman said six employees were being treated for undetermined
injuries.
   ``The fire is emitting an awful lot of black smoke into the air
but it does not have any environmental impact,'' Spencer said.

   Demands by hard-line radical students
for reunification with North Korea and their show of admiration for
life in the communist north have stunned South Korea.
   South Koreans cannot understand why idealistic and privileged
students are reaching out to one of the most oppressive and
regimented regimes in the world. Many people in the south also see
the north as a military menace and fear the threat of invasion.
   ``People just do not know what these students are thinking.
There is a sense that something has gone wrong with our nation,''
said a South Korean editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Reunification of the divided Korean peninsula is a highly
emotional issue. Most South Koreans hope for a return to unity, but
fear the north is determined to impose its rule.
   The radical students have taken up the cause of reunification,
insisting they are not communists but nationalists attempting to
reunite the two nations at all costs. They say unity is a goal that
overrides other considerations, including ideological differences.
   The radicals claim the United States enforces division of the
peninsula and rules the south as a colony.
   ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive out the Yankee imperialists!''
have become the main chants at radical protests.
   Up to 40,000 radical students planned to march to North Korea to
meet with northern students Friday to force immediate unification.
The South Korean government banned the march.
   Wall posters put up by radicals on college campuses praise North
Korea as a peaceful nation and a model of ``Korean life.'' North
Korean-style propaganda pictures show happy workers and peasants
working and living in the north.
   Student protesters have also started to use slogans from North
Korean radio propaganda broadcasts such as, ``Destroy the fascist
clique'' and ``Fighters for liberation.''
   Some anti-American slogans echo North Korean propaganda, which
portrays the south as a slave colony occupied by U.S. troops and a
puppet regime. Wall posters repeat North Korea's claim the United
States is preparing to invade the north.
   About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in the south under a mutual
defense treaty. Most South Koreans, still haunted by memories of
North Korea's invasion of the South in 1950, are thought to support
the U.S. presence as a critical defense against another attack.
   Supreme North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who launched the war,
still insists his forces will ``liberate'' the south.
   ``The real obstruction to reunification is the North Korean
regime, which has never changed its policy to communize South
Korea,'' Chosun Ilbo, a leading independent newspaper, said in an
editorial.
   The Korean peninsula was divided at the end of World War II when
U.S. and Soviet forces ended the Japanese occupation. The south has
developed into one of the most properious nations in Asia as the
north has become a ruthless autocratic state with an economy in
virtual collapse because of mismanagement.
   The radicals represent a small, but powerful minority on college
campuses, with the most extreme, pro-leftist elements increasingly
taking control of the protest movement as its support has declined.
   Radical students and dissidents have lost much support since
President Roh Tae-woo's government ended almost all authoritarian
controls and began major reforms after massive unrest last summer.
   The radicals insist nothing has changed and continue to call for
the overthrow of the government. They have compensated for loss of
numbers with greater extremism and a growing willingness to use
violence.
   Radicals have attacked government and U.S. diplomatic buildings
with bombs and firebombs as well as fighting riot police in campus
and street battles.
   The growing extremism of the radicals is seen by some observers
as an inevitable result of years of violent political confrontation
in South Korea. Authoritarian rule, they say, has produced
hard-core extremists who want a revolution and are turning to the
north as they lose support at home.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. Frank E. Petersen, the first and
still the only black general officer on active duty in the Marine
Corps, will retire on Aug. 1 after more than 38 years of service,
the Pentagon announced Wednesday.
   Petersen, 56, a jet fighter pilot and combat veteran of Korea
and Vietnam, became the Marine Corps' first active-duty black
general in 1979.
   Since June 1986, he has served as the chief of the Marine Corps
Combat Development Command at Quantico, Va., a position in which he
ended up playing a key role in reviewing the cases of Marine
embassy guards accused of espionage.
   Now a three-star general, Petersen is one of the highest ranking
blacks among officers of all four services and also is the Navy's
``Gray Eagle'' and the Pentagon's senior aviator. The Gray Eagle is
the nickname for the man or woman in the Navy or Marine Corps who
is the longest-serving, active-duty aviator.
   Petersen was designated a pilot in October 1952, becoming the
corps' first black aviator.
   The Topeka, Kan., native has won numerous decorations, including
the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross,
the Air Medal and the Purple Heart. He has logged more than 4,000
hours in various fighter and attack aircraft and flew more than 350
combat missions in the two wars.
   According to the Marine Corps, Maj. Gen. William R. Etnyre is
expected to succeed Petersen in the Quantico job. Etnyre, currently
serving as the deputy chief of staff for requirements and programs
at Marine headquarters, has been nominated by President Reagan to
receive his third star.
   While Petersen is the Marine's only active-duty black general,
the corps does have another black general officer serving with the
Marine Corps Reserves.

<HEAD>Spring Salmon Run in Connecticut River Less Than One-Third Last
Year's</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This spring's run of Atlantic Salmon
in the Connecticut River is less than one-third of last year's, the
head of a joint federal and state program to restore the prize game
fish said Wednesday.
   But biologists aren't certain yet whether the cool spring
weather has just slowed the fish or they died before reaching
spawning age, said Stephen Rideout, executive director of the
Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission.
   ``Since the Connecticut River tends to have the first run of the
season (along the East Coast), we won't have any reasonable
assumptions until the end of the month, but it appears that returns
are also slow in the Merrimack River and the rivers in Maine,''
Rideout said. Normally the salmon run in the Connecticut ends in
mid-July.
   So far this spring 81 returning salmon have been spotted in the
Connecticut River, including 67 at the Holyoke Dam, he said.
   Last year, 294 fish had returned by early June, he said. And for
the spring, 353 salmon returned to the Connecticut River.
   ``This could be the first year since 1983 that we haven't had an
increase and that's a little dissappointing. But you have to expect
some ups and downs and as long as we can learn from what happend,
it's not discouraging,'' Rideout said.
   The first salmon returned to the river in the restoration
program in 1975. Before the first dams were built on the river in
the 1700s, biologists estimated that 40,000 salmon migrated up the
river annually.
   Rideout said commercial fishing off Greenland and a disease that
affected the fins of the young fish stocked in the lower reaches of
the river in 1986 may have contributed to the lack of adult fish
this spring. Salmon are hatched in fresh water, migrate to the sea
when they are about a year old and return to fresh water to spawn
when they are about 3 years old.
   Young fish stocked in the upper tributaries of the river in
Vermont and New Hampshire may also have had a high mortality rate,
because of low water when they were trying to make it downstream
past hydropower dams to the sea in 1986, he said.
   ``The river flow was at its lowest in 20 years in April and May
of 1986 when they would have come downstream,'' Rideout said.

   First lady Nancy Reagan called on
foster grandparents Wednesday to work with young people who use
drugs and ``desperately'' need help.
   ``This will be a difficult undertaking for you, because drug
abusers may be suspicious, selfish, arrogant. They may think they
don't need help,'' Mrs. Reagan said in a speech to 500 members of
the National Foster Grandparent Jamboree at Disney World's Epcot
Center.
   She also conferred the title of honorary grandparent on Mickey
Mouse, who will be 60 in November.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has campaigned against drug abuse and has
supported the foster grandparent program since the late 1960s, said
merging the causes would help young drug abusers.
   ``It's a horrifying reality that virtually every child will be
forced to make a decision on whether to use drugs by the age of 12
or 14,'' she said.
   ``They need to know that somebody still believes in them, even
though they don't believe in themselves. They need to feel they are
worth knowing and worth caring about.''
   After the ceremony, Mrs. Reagan was whisked over to the Magic
Kingdom to help celebrate Mickey's birthday at ``Mickey's
Birthdayland.'' The three-acre site is a new comic strip town where
the mouse's friends can visit with Mickey and Minnie and other
Disney characters. It opens officially later this month as part of
a year-long celebration of Mickey's 60th anniversary.
   The foster grandparents program was established by the federal
government in 1965 to help low-income people over 60 remain active
in community service by helping underprivileged youngsters.
   Volunteers are paid a stipend of $44 a week for 20 hours of work
with children at public schools, day-care centers, homes for the
handicapped and similar facilities.
   The annual jamboree is sponsored by Baylor University in Texas,
one of the program's founders.

<HEAD>Survey: Teens Worry About AIDS, Paying For College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three out of 10 teen-agers say they have
changed their sexual practices because of AIDS, and they are as
worried about the disease as they are about paying for college,
according to a study released Wednesday.
   The survey, which looked at the top concerns of junior and
senior high school students, revealed that money, AIDS and making
the wrong decisions about the future are their biggest worries.
   And while the teens were generally happy with their own lives,
they were ``fairly pessimistic about the world around them,''
especially about social problems and the country's future, said Jay
Friedland of Guideline Research, which conducted the study for the
American Home Economics Association.
   For example, 58 percent do not think there will be an end to
racial discrimination in the United States in their lifetimes; 42
percent think there will be nuclear war in their lifetimes; and 62
percent think their lives will be harder than those of their
parents.
   The study, funded by Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. and Lever Brothers
Co., surveyed 510 high school juniors and seniors nationwide
between March 25 and April 5. Quotas were established so that a
sample of 300 teens selected at random reflected Census Bureau
breakdowns of student population by sex, race and ethnicity. A
supplemental group of 210 included only blacks and Hispanics.
   The average age of the respondents was 17, and the survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   The teen-agers were asked how concerned they were about 32
issues. Topics that drew responses of ``extremely'' or ``very''
were considered top concerns.
   Being able to pay for college was a top concern for 39 percent
of the teens surveyed, as was the fear of contracting AIDS.
Thirty-four percent listed making the wrong decisions about the
future and not being able to change them as a top concern.
   Fear that the United States ``is steadily going down hill''
greatly concerned 33 percent; and the prospects of a nationwide
depression worried 30 percent. Not earning enough money to enjoy
the better things in life was a top concern for 29 percent.
   Eleven percent said they know someone who has acquired immune
deficiency syndrome or who has died of it. Thirty percent said the
statement ``I have changed my sex life because of fear of getting
AIDS'' applied to them.
   The teens were not asked to elaborate, or whether in fact they
were sexually active. The survey thus did not reveal whether fear
of AIDS led them to elect abstinence or to take precautions when
having sex.
   The data showed that high school juniors and seniors are keenly
aware that drugs, alcohol and sexual abuse are issues that affect
their friends. But they are less likely to admit to having such
problems themselves.
   Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed have a friend who has
thought of or committed suicide, and 53 percent said some of their
friends were ruining their lives because of drugs. Forty-six
percent report alcohol abuse among their friends, and 32 percent
claim to have a friend who has been sexually abused.
   But only 8 percent or less admitted that they have drug or
alcohol problems or have thought about suicide.
   Despite their worries, 65 percent of those surveyed said they
believe that science will find cures for serious diseases such as
AIDS and cancer in their lifetimes.
   And they were optimistic about the future _ 78 percent expect to
attend college and 94 percent believe having a job they enjoy will
be an important part of their lives.
   Dr. Gail House, the association's executive director, said the
survey will be used to develop courses to help teens with economic,
health, emotional and other life problems. The American Home
Economics Association represents more than 27,000 home economists,
including educators, dieticians and others.

   A coyote may lose his appetite for mutton if
he attacks sheep protected by a new collar that wards off predators
with sirens, strobe lights and an ear-piercing,
ultra-high-frequency signal, the inventor says.
   A patent is pending for Kevin Parmely's Sonic Spook collar, a
2.5-pound device activated by sudden movement.
   Parmely, who raises sheep, said he initially began to develop a
stationary warning device but realized it would be difficult to
keep sheep near one.
   ``I decided I needed a device that goes on the sheep, and it
took three years to finally get it small enough,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``You can't have a sheep carrying around a big
battery.''
   ``When the coyotes come into sheep, the sheep jump up and it
activates the sirens and flashing lights,'' he said. The warnings
continue for 10 seconds, and the unit resets itself in 10 minutes,
he said.
   In addition to a strobe light, each collar emits either an
audible warning, such as a siren, or a high-frequency sound that is
said to be painful to coyotes, he said.
   The collar contains an electronic eye that shuts it off in the
daytime, since about 95 percent of coyote attacks occur at night,
Parmely said.
   The collars are sold in sets of five, which is adequate to
protect about 200 sheep, Parmely said. Each set costs $625, he
said. The first shipment has been sold to sheep producers in South
Dakota, Parmely said.
   The combination has been shown to keep a coyote away from sheep
for an average of 93 days, Parmely said.
   The state Agriculture Department helped Parmely get started by
purchasing 80 percent of his $29,000 bank loan.
   ``It was unique and innovative enough so we could get involved
in it,'' said Randy Englund, rural development officer in the
department. Englund said Parmely also has obtained backing from
private interests.

   Paraguayan military dictator Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner, in power longer than any other leader in the
Western Hemisphere, on Wednesday took his second tour of Disney
World, said a resort spokesman.
   The 76-year-old general's private itinerary called for his first

   Stroessner was visiting the amusement park with about 60 people,

said. He spent most of Tuesday visiting Sea World Marine Park
before calling Disney to arrange a one-day escorted visit, Irvine
said.
   Stroessner, who has been in power since 1956, was on his way

<HEAD>US Denies Tensions with Greece Over Extradition Request</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department denied Wednesday that its
relations with Greece are tense over Greek reluctance to extradite
a Palestinian suspected of the terrorist bombings of two U.S.
airliners.
   U.S. officials have said privately that Greece is stalling on an
American request to extradite Mohammed Rashid, who is wanted in
connection with an explosion aboard a Pan American World Airways
plane in Hawaii in 1982 and a blast aboard a Trans World Airlines
jet over Greece in 1986.
   They said Rashid was arrested recently in Greece on the basis of
U.S. intelligence information.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said, ``In general
... our bilateral relations with Greece, including cooperation on
anti-terrorism policy, continue to be conducted normally.''
   She declined to comment on details of the Rashid case, saying
only that ``it's our practice to share information with our allies,
including Greece, on the issue of terrorism. We do not discuss the
specifics of such sharing of information.''
   U.S. officials said privately that Greece has told the United
States it does not have sufficient evidence against Rashid to
warrant extraditing him, and asked for additional information.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Keeley met with Greek Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou in Athens last Thursday to discuss the case.
Greek officials have refused to comment publicly on the case or to
say whether they are holding Rashid.
   Mrs. Oakley said the State Department's senior counter-terrorism
official, L. Paul Bremer, went to Athens recently and had
``fruitful discussions on anti-terrorism issues.''
   Privately, U.S. officials say Bremer took the opportunity of his
visit to press the U.S. demand for Rashid's extradition.
   The flap over Rashid comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-Greek
relations. The two countries are negotiating the renewal of leases
for four American military bases in Greece that expire Dec. 31.
   Papandreou threatened last year to call off the negotiations
when the United States accused his government of being lax toward
terrorism.
   The United States backed off its accusations in a formal letter
to Papandreou, and the talks resumed.
   ``There are no new tensions in our relationship,'' Mrs. Oakley
said Wednesday.
   Rashid is reportedly a member of the Abu Nidal group, which is a
Palestinian splinter group based in Libya.
   Bremer said in recent interviews that Abu Nidal has stepped up
his group's terrorism activities recently, sometimes as a surrogate
for Libya.

   Police thwarted a student march and pro-democracy
rally planned for Beijing's huge main square Wednesday and
dispersed a dozen students who gathered nearby to complain. Armed
officers ringed the square until 11 p.m.
   Nearly 1,000 students rallied late into the night on the Beijing
University campus 10 miles away, but speakers urged them to press
their demands through ``proper channels.'' No plans were made to
try the march another day.
   ``I wouldn't join a demonstration. Now isn't the time,'' said
one student. Another declared: ``Quite frankly, we are afraid.''
   Students began arriving at Tiananmen Square in midafternoon,
apparently traveling singly from Beijing University and other
schools, but found the police were there in force.
   At the National Museum of Chinese Revolution, on one side of the
square, about a dozen students from Beijing University complained
in late afternoon that their right of expression had been violated.
Police quickly intervened.
   Officers were seen taking one person away, but the students said
he was not from their group.
   City authorities had told students the 10-mile march they
planned for Wednesday afternoon from Beijing University to
Tiananmen, the symbolic political center of China, was illegal and
would endanger the stability necessary for economic and political
reforms.
   Hundreds of students at China's most prominent university milled
around posters calling for democracy, human rights and better
conditions for underpaid intellectuals, but seemed undecided about
what to do.
   Students at both the campus and Tienanmen said school
authorities had called meetings to warn students of consequences,
including arrest, if they went ahead with the march.
   At the 100-acre square, police stood at attention about 50 feet
apart around the perimeter. Several dozen students in small groups
waited nearby until early evening.
   One student said: ``I came to watch, but I won't join in because
students have no power. What good is it?''
   Police reinforcements and vehicles were posted in side streets
around the square, which is framed by the Great Hall of the People,
Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, the Museum of Revolution and the old
Imperial Palace.
   Tourists usually stroll through the square, but were ordered out
at 1 p.m. and milled around the edges, waiting for something to
happen.
   Posters promoting the rally had been displayed on the Beijing
University campus for several days, but those put up Wednesday had
a more sober tone.
   ``People of Beijing University, think three times,'' one
advised. ``If Beijing University moves one step, all of China will
shake.''
   Several others also echoed official statements published by the
government press Wednesday urging students to maintain the nation's
stability and unity so China can continue the reforms of the past
decade.
   One poster said bluntly: ``We should march, but we should also
obey the law.''
   A mass march would have been the first major political protest
by students since pro-democracy demonstrations in the winter of
1986-87 that led to a crackdown on Western liberal ideas. Hu
Yaobang, a noted liberal, was ousted as Communist Party chief for
failing to quell the disturbances quickly.
   The latest unrest stems from the death June 2 of a Beijing
University student who was beaten by a gang off-campus.
   About 1,000 students joined an all-night march from the campus
to Tiananmen Square after the death of Chai Qingfeng, 22. Police
did not interfere with that protest, which focused on demands for a
quick resolution to the murder case and did not address sensitive
political issues.
   Six non-students were arrested, satisfying student demands for
quick justice, but the protest expanded to such complaints as poor
living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects for
intellectuals after graduation.
   Since the killing, hundreds have gathered on the campus in the
evenings for impromptu debates. Posters appeared on bulletin boards
demanding democracy, a free press, an end to government corruption
and greater respect and higher salaries for intellectuals.
   Beijing University students marched to Tiananmen Square in 1919
to protest Japan's occupation of part of China. The result was a
nationalist fervor from which the Communist Party emerged in the
1920s.
   Since then, Beijing students often have flocked to Tiananmen to
celebrate important events or voice political concerns.

   Hundreds of firefighters today battled a
wind-driven blaze on the Northern Cheyenne Indian reservation that
has blackened nearly 18,000 acres of drought-stricken prairie,
authorities said.
   About 750 people from Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and the Dakotas
used picks, shovels and small napalm-like bombs for triggering
backfires to control the three-day-old blaze east of the Custer
Battlefield National Monument.
   Michelle Ravnikar, a fire information officer, said that the
situation was ``looking pretty good'' because of progress made in
laying down fire lines. She said that officials expect to contain
the fire by Thursday night.
   Firefighters had completed 22 of the 28 miles of fire lines
needed to encircle the blaze, she said.
   No homes or businesses were threatened by the fire, but
officials were urged caution by motorists on smoke-covered roads.
   Airspace above the fire was closed to aircraft because of poor
visibility and to make room for helicopters helping firefighters.
Smoke could be seen 60 miles away in Hardin.
   The fire started near the Crazy Head Campgrounds about 14 miles
east of Lame Deer. Investigators believed that the fire was
man-caused.
   Helicopters dropped ping-pong balls loaded with flammable liquid
to start backfires on the edges of the blaze. Backfires char the
area in front of the fire and deprive it of fuel.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib is fighting new
political battles at home and abroad as Soviet troops withdraw from
Afghanistan and Moslem guerrillas press their war against his
government.
   Najib's visit to the United Nations disarmament conference in
New York this week fits neatly into his campaign to be treated as
an international statesman and a legitimate leader, rather than a
leader of a Soviet client state.
   His efforts to win respectability abroad got a windfall in the
past two weeks in the form of visits to Kabul by top French and
Italian diplomats and by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N.
special envoy for the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
   But Najib's efforts to create a more broadly based government _
at least in outward appearance _ have bogged down.
   The U.S.-supported mujahedeen guerrillas have rejected his
repeated calls for them to lay down their arms and accept posts in
his government.
   In his United Nations debut speech Tuesday, Najib threatened to
seek a delay in the Soviet troop withdrawal if Pakistan continued
its vigorous support of anti-communist guerrillas.
   ``We want to visualize an optimistic situation,'' Najib said.
``But should such violations acquire a permanent character ... in
such a case, we would certainly renew our consideration on the
schedule of withdrawal and take proper reactions, together with the
Soviet Union.''
   On May 26, Najib nominated a new prime minister, Mohammad Hassan
Sharq. Sharq has never been identified as a member of the ruling,
Soviet-style People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, but he is a
political survivor and a pragmatic technocrat who has worked
closely with party officials for nearly a decade.
   Government officials predicted the rest of the Cabinet would be
named within 24 hours. But Najib left on his trip to Moscow, New
York and Havana while the fractious coterie of senior party members
was still trying to forge it. Sharq announced his 24-member Cabinet
Tuesday while Najib was in New York.
   Najib's departure before the Cabinet was announced invites two
theories:
   _It is evidence of supreme confidence that he is firmly in
control of the government, or at least as firmly in control as any
leader has been in a country with a history of disregard for
central authority.
   _Conversely, it puts him conveniently _ and securely _ out of
the country should fellow party members decide the time has come to
install a new leader.
   Najib, who came to power in 1986, is the fourth Afghan leader in
the 15 years since King Zahir Shah was overthrown. Each of the
other three was either forcibly shunted aside or assassinated at
the instigation of the Soviet-style party.
   Along with his struggle to survive, Najib is fighting an uphill
battle to shed the ruthless image he acquired when he headed the
dreaded KHAD secret police, Afghanistan's version of the Soviet
Union's KGB.
   A non-Western observer predicted the Afghan people would neither
forgive nor forget Najib's days at KHAD. ``They say he personally
signed a lot of death sentences,'' the observer said on condition
of anonymity.
   A Western diplomat who agrees with Washington that Najib and his
party are doomed remarked on the divisions within the party that in
its decade of power has seen constantly shifting alliances _ as
well as expulsions and sometimes executions of politburo members.
   ``There are guys sitting in the same room who tortured each
other,'' the diplomat said on condition of anonymity. ``There's no
party dogma that will hold this thing together.''
   Another Western diplomat dismissed Washington's optimism that
the People's Democratic Party would crumble as the Soviets continue
with their withdrawal of more than 100,000 troops, scheduled for
completion by Feb. 15, 1989.
   ``The Soviet Union has a very firm strategy: to withdraw and to
stay here at the same time,'' the diplomat said on condition of
anonymity. He cautioned against optimism that a Soviet military
withdrawal meant an end to Soviet interest and influence in
Afghanistan.
   Najib told a news conference Tuesday that more than 34,000
Soviet soldiers have left Afghanistan since May 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement calling for a complete Red Army pullout
over nine months.
   The visits to Afghanistan by the secretaries-general of the
French and Italian foreign ministries were denounced by some
diplomats from Western allies who had stood firm in not recognizing
Afghan leaders installed after the Soviet military intervention in
1979.
   Western nations _ including France, Italy, Britain and the
United States _ withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the Soviet
intervention. Nearly a decade later, their embassies in Kabul still
operate without ambassadors.
   But France and Italy provided the first crack in Western
solidarity.
   In separate letters, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Italian President Francesco Cossiga appealed to Najib to pardon
citizens of their countries who had been jailed in Kabul: a French
photojournalist and an Italian reporter who were convicted of
espionage after entering Afghanistan with the Pakistani-based
mujahedeen guerrillas.
   The appeals succeeded _ the journalists were released. The
letters that brought about their freedom congratulated Najib on the
April 14 Geneva agreement that brought about the Soviet withdrawal.
And they granted Najib a measure of the international
respectability he is seeking.

   Primaries in seven states cleared the way for
multimillion-dollar Senate battles in New Jersey and California,
and Republicans said Wednesday the results also bolstered their
hopes of ousting Sens. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John Melcher
of Montana.
   In California, voters rejected propositions authorizing an AIDS
quarantine, closing the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, dividing mammoth
San Bernardino County in two and relaxing state spending limits
imposed after tax-slashing Proposition 13 was passed a decade ago.
   Tuesday's ballots also included one race for governor and one
for mayor. In Montana, former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge captured
the nomination to succeed retiring Democrat Ted Schwinden, scoring
39 percent of the vote in a six-man race. He will face Republican
former state Sen. Stan Stephens. In San Diego, Mayor Maureen
O'Connor was elected to a full four-year term with 58 percent of
the vote.
   In congressional races, California Rep. Ernest Konnyu, a
freshman Republican from the San Jose suburb of Saratoga, became
the first incumbent to lose a primary this year, falling by a 58
percent-to-42 percent margin to Tom Campbell, a politically
moderate Stanford professor.
   Newark, N.J., Councilman Donald Payne won the Democratic
nomination in the 10th District with 73 percent of the vote for a
chance to succeed retiring Peter Rodino and become the state's
first black in Congress. Victory in the primary is tantamount to
election in the overwhelmingly Democratic district.
   Oliver North, the fired White House national security aide
indicted in the Iran-Contra affair, scored a personal success as a
campaigner when two Republicans for whom he stumped in Southern
California won congressional primaries. Former deputy White House
counsel Christopher Cox was the victor over 12 rivals in the 40th
District and former Reagan administration speechwriter Dana
Rohrabacher topped an eight-candidate field in the 42nd District.
   In Senate races, first-term New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg
polled 77 percent of the vote against two challengers and will
defend his seat against Pete Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes
scholar and Vietnam War hero who moved from New York to New Jersey
to make his first bid for office.
   The two expect to spend a total of $14 million on the race,
which the national GOP has targeted as vital to its hopes of
recapturing the Senate. Democrats now control it 54-46.
   In California, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy shrugged off
three primary opponents for the right to challenge first-term
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson.
   ``Wilson has spent $7 million already on his re-election, and
his numbers are exactly where they were 18 months ago, at 50
percent, which is the definition of a very vulnerable incumbent,''
said Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington.
   Her counterpart in the GOP, Tom Mason, saw vulnerability on the
Democratic side in Montana, where Sen. John Melcher won nomination
to a third term with 76 percent of the vote against a political
newcomer.
   ``The good news for us is that Melcher's 76 percent against a
nobody tells us a good manifestation of voter dissatisfaction,''
Mason said.
   Melcher, not surprisingly, took exception to that analysis.
   ``I think the Republican Senatorial Committee would like to
capture this seat,'' he said. ``I'm going to make sure that doesn't
happen.''
   The Republican candidate, county commissioner Conrad Burns, said
he expected Melcher to attack him as inexperienced, but added,
``When you're green, you're growing, and when you're ripe, you're
rotten.... That's how we'll counter.''
   Mason also said the victory by state Sen. Bill Valentine in New
Mexico's four-man GOP Senate primary put him in good shape for a
run at first-term Democrat Bingaman.
   ``It was a clean campaign, and there are no scars left, so we
can focus on Bingaman's lack of name ID and lack of depth of
support,'' Mason said.
   Valentine immediately attacked his rival as too liberal for New
Mexico, saying Bingaman supported ``big labor, big government and
big spending on the part of Washington.''
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Valentine had 33,698 votes
or 43 percent, and his closest challenger, former Interior
Department official Rick Montoya, had 22,392 votes or 28 percent.
   In other voting Tuesday, Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a
son-in-law of former Gov. George C. Wallace, won the Democratic
nomination to the Alabama Supreme Court; five supporters of Lyndon
LaRouche all lost congressional primaries in Iowa; and in South
Dakota, there were no statewide races and only 26 primaries for the
105 state Senate and House seats.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
announced today that the Soviet Union would observe a permament
moratorium on nuclear testing if the United States also agrees.
   In a speech to a special General Assembly session on
disarmament, Shevardnadze also declared that the Soviet Union would
announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval ships
calling on foreign ports, if the United States and Western allies
do the same.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters later praised the speech as
``hopeful, useful and good.''
   ``It was an extremely interesting new speech, it broke a lot of
new ground and it is deserving of study,'' the permanent U.S.
representative said.
   Shevardnadze also said the Geneva accords for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan are being violated, undermining
confidence in other peace talks.
   The Soviet official did not identify the United States or
Pakistan as the offending parties, but his implication was clear.
   ``When one party observes its obligations under the Geneva
agreements while the other party is violating them, this naturally
causes us to have doubts about our partner and to refuse to trust
him,'' he said.
   The United Nations helped negotiate a pact, signed in Geneva,
which calls for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Red Army troops
from Afghanistan within a year, and the repatriation of millions of
Afghan refugees who fled to Pakistan and Iran.
   In his 45-minute address, Shevardnadze called for reductions in
conventional arms in Europe, including cutbacks by both sides of
about 500,000 soldiers each.
   His speech included a call for a ban on space weapons, a
chemical weapons ban, a U.N. naval force and a central role for the
United Nations in verifying disarmament.
   The Soviet Union announced a unilateral testing moratorium in
August 1985, the United States refused to go along and the
moratorium ended 1{ years later.
   The highlight of the speech appeared to be a renewal of the
Soviet offer.
   ``Our invariable position on a nuclear testing moratorium is
still valid,'' Shevardnadze said. ``On the basis of reciprocity
with the United States, we are ready to reintroduce and to observe
it, this time not for a year and a half, but for all times.''
   Without limiting and banning nuclear tests, he said, it is
difficult or impossible to prevent the global spread of nuclear
weapons.
   The Soviet Foreign Minister repeated his call for creation of
U.N. naval forces comprised of forces of the permanent members of
the Security Council: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain,
China and France.
   On port calls, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was ``ready to
announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons aboard its
naval ships calling at foreign ports.''
   The United States consistently has refused to make disclosures
about port calls by nuclear-armed ships.

<HEAD>Outbreak of TB Revealed in Nevada Rest Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A tuberculosis outbreak at a rest home
has infected 23 employees, 19 patients and four people working at a
nearby hospital, prompting the state to consider rules to prevent a
recurrence.
   The outbreak at Ruby Mountains Manor in Elko, which has been
known to health authorities since January, resulted in its
temporary decertification although Health Division Administrator
Larry Matheis said Tuesday all people involved have been treated
and ``the situation now is completely under control.''
   Matheis said the outbreak is the first serious problem involving
TB in Nevada in 25 years, the first of its sort in a nursing home
anywhere in the nation in recent years, and follows a national
resurgence of the disease.
   Ruby Mountains, headed by John Watson of Sparks, is operating
under a provisional license, has passed one inspection, and is due
for a follow-up in about two weeks, Matheis added.
   Matheis said federal Medicare and Medicaid funds have been cut
off although state Medicaid payments are still being made to the
facility. He also said no new admissions are being allowed at this
time. There are about 70 patients at the home.
   Four of the cases are being treated as confirmed TB while the
others are viewed as infections. All those involved have undergone
treatment, Matheis said.
   A Board of Health hearing July 20 will deal with a proposed
regulation requiring all nursing homes admissions to be tested for
TB as a result of the outbreak at Ruby Mountains Manor.
   Gov. Richard Bryan had been asked to sign emergency rules but
instead suggested Matheis send a letter, being mailed this week, to
all nursing homes requesting the tests and a records review to
ensure all employees have had annual TB tests.
   Dr. Debra Brus, who headed a Health Division inspection team
sent to Ruby Mountains Manor, said one woman still working at the
facility is a confirmed TB sufferer and may have been the source of
the infections _ but hadn't had a TB test since 1986.
   ``Probably, had that test been performed, this might not have
happened,'' said Brus. But she added it's ``pure, unadulterated
baloney'' to suggest the state didn't react quickly enough to the
problem.
   One elderly patient at the home is infected and near death, but
Brus said she was advised by the nursing home's medical director
that old age, heart trouble and other ailments rather than the TB
infection are the main causes for the patient's condition.

<HEAD>Cuba, Ethiopia Loan Repayments Doubted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects of loan repayments by the
governments of Cuba and Ethiopia are doubtful but prospects of
repayment from the Soviet Union are excellent, President John A.
Bohn Jr. of the government's Export-Import Bank told senators
Wednesday.
   Bohn said he expects repayment only if there is a change in the
Cuban government.
   Ann Frey, a press officer at the bank, said Cuba owes it more
than $92 million in principal and interest. The debt is from loans
made before President Fidel Castro came to power.
   Ms. Frey said Ethiopia owes more than $17 million in loans and
guarantees and has not received any additional loans since 1984.
Bohn said he sees no chance of repayment under the present system
there.
   The Soviet Union owes more than $142 million, having already
paid most of the money the bank lent it in 1973 and 1974, and is
continuing repayments on schedule, according to the bank's figures.
   These loans are carried on the bank's books as assets. So are
loans made to the Nationalist government on mainland China before
the communist government drove it to Taiwan in 1949.
   Bohn told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations that the bank lost $461 million in the year that ended
last Sept. 30 and expects to lose $350 million in the current year.
He explained the losses as due largely to loans made at low
interest rates in the early 1980s while the bank itself had to
borrow at higher rates.
   The bank sees its job as lending money, at subsidized interest
rates when necessary, to promote sales of U.S. industry _ largely
to Third World purchasers. It competes with similar lenders in
other exporting countries, especially France, Japan, Britain and
Canada.
   It is asking Congress for authority to lend another $705 million
in the year beginning Oct. 1 and to guarantee $10.2 billion in
loans by commercial banks. Bohn submitted a table showing the bank
expects to make money again in the year 2008, as it did until 1982.
   The General Accounting Office, which watches over spending for
Congress, wants the bank to set up a reserve to cover losses, as
commercial banks do. Bohn declined that proposal again Wednesday.
   ``We would have to make determinations that certain countries
are not likely to repay,'' he said.
   ``Although we would attempt, of course, tokeep such information
secret... (it) would almost certainly become public knowledge. This
could not only impair U.S. bilateral relations but could also send
the wrong signal to debtor countries and in fact may encourage them
not to repay their debts.''
   Another witness, Nancy D. Frame, is acting director of another,
smaller U.S. government effort which promotes both trade and aid
objectives: the trade and development program of the International
Development Cooperation Agency.
   She testified that since 1980 it has promoted more than $1.2
billion worth of U.S. exports and expects to generate another $7
billion worth. The program has had $128 million in appropriations
over that period and is seeking another $20.4 million for fiscal
1989.
   By far the agency's biggest activity has been in China, where it
spent $15.7 million between 1981 and 1987. It spent $7.6 million in
Thailand, $4.6 million in the Philippines and $4.3 million in
Indonesia.

   The Philippines deported an alleged terrorist to
Japan on Wednesday and police questioned him about whether the
Japanese Red Army plans attacks at the Olympic Games in South
Korea, a police official said.
   Hiroshi Sensui, 51, was arrested Tuesday at a Manila hospital,
where he was said to have undergone plastic surgery to conceal his
identity. He was deported Wednesday afternoon and about 100 police
stood guard when he arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport.
   ``He kept silent throughout the brief interrogation upon his
arrival,'' said the police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Mirian Defensor-Santiago, the Philippine immigration
commissioner said in Manila that preliminary reports from security
officials in the region indicated ``the terrorists have initiated
activity expected to culminate in the Olympic Games.''
   She said evidence indicated the Japanese Red Army, formed in
1968, had planned to use Manila as a base for operations during the
Olympics, scheduled for Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul, South Korea.
   Authorities in Japan and Manila have said Sensui was the Red
Army's chief representative in the Philippines. The Japanese police
official said Sensui needs some rest and sleep,'' and interrogation
would resume Thursday.
   He would not say what charges the man would face beyond that of
using a false passport in Manila. The official said when and how
Sensui went to the Philippines was not clear.
   Mrs. Defensor-Santiago said the suspect had lived there for
several years under the assumed name Hiroshi Yamaguchi and
initially denied being Sensui. Officials said fingerprints
confirmed his identity.
   Police say Sensui was released from prison in 1977 in exchange
for hostages aboard a Japan Air Lines plane the Japanese Red Army
hijacked in Dacca, Bangladesh.
   Recent arrests of several alleged members of the terrorist group
have caused speculation that it had resumed operations after being
dormant for several years, and might be planning attacks at the
Olympics.
   Authorities learned that Sensui was in the Philippines after
Osamu Maruoka, alleged to be No. 2 in the Japanese Red Army, was
arrested in Japan in November, police said.
   After Maruoka's arrest, investigators found he had contacts in
Manila with Sensui and Sasaki Norio, an explosives expert alleged
to be a member of the group, officials said.
   Police said they also found Maruoka had a one-way airplane
ticket to Seoul the following month.
   On May 6, Yasuhiro Shibata, an alleged Red Army member linked to
the hijacking of a Japan Air Lines plane to North Korea in 1970,
was arrested in Tokyo. Yu Kikumura, another suspected Red Army
member, was arrested in the United States in April on charges of
possessing explosives.
   Italian police are seeking two more alleged Red Army members _
Junzo Okudaira and Fusako Shigenobu, said to be the terrorist
group's leader _ for suspected involvement in a car bomb attack in
Naples in April.
   At its peak, the Japanese Red Army had only about 300 members,
police say, and crackdowns in Japan forced it to move to the Middle
East. It gained notoriety with an attack at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport
in 1972 in which 28 people were killed, including two of the three
terrorists involved.

   Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz, the defense
minister of Saudi Arabia, may go home this weekend after knee
surgery in Birmingham, a hospital spokesman said Wednesday.
   The prince is ``doing very well,'' said Mike Immel, executive
director of the Alabama Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center at
South Highlands Hospital.
   Prince Sultan, 62, underwent surgery last week to repair his
left knee. Doctors removed bony spurs and damaged cartilage and
remodeled the inner surface of the joint.
   The prince checked out of the hosptal Sunday and is staying in a
rented private residence, Immel said.
   Three other people in the prince's 200-member entourage of

   Adrienne L. Brown, wife of soul singer James
Brown, has been indicted on two counts of possessing the drug PCP.
   The indictment Tuesday accused Mrs. Brown, 38, of Beech Island,
S.C., of possessing PCP on April 9 and May 20.
   On April 9, Mrs. Brown and a New York woman were arrested at
Augusta's Bush Field airport after police were told Mrs. Brown
would be receiving a shipment of PCP. According to official
reports, police confiscated nasal spray bottles containing a brown,
leafy substance that was mixed with PCP.
   On May 20, police met Mrs. Brown at Bush Field after receiving
information she would be returning from New York with drugs. During
a search, police found three bottles containing about eight ounces
of PCP, police said.
   Mrs. Brown and her husband, who is known as ``The Godfather of
Soul,'' have had continuing domestic problems that led to the
singer's two arrests this spring on charges of assaulting his wife.
Brown has said he plans to divorce his wife.

   It will be probably be at least two weeks
before Gov. Rose Mofford resumes a normal schedule following a mild
concussion two weeks ago, her doctor says.
   The governor is ``going to have to continue to restrict her
schedule for the next couple of weeks,'' said Timothy Harrington, a
neurologist. ``She expected herself to get over it in two or three
days so she could get right back to a full schedule, but that's
just not the way you get over a concussion.''
   Mrs. Mofford continues to complain of headaches and fatigue, and
called in sick Tuesday, one day after returning to work for the
first time since she fell from a platform May 22 and struck her
head.
   ``We're really just going to have to see what she can tolerate
on a week-to-week basis,'' Harrington said Tuesday. ``But she's
really doing OK. She had a good weekend, and I think she just tried
to do too much yesterday (Monday).''
   Mrs. Mofford, who will be 66 on Friday, ``woke up this morning
not feeling well'' said Vada Manager, her press secretary. Mrs.
Mofford has been working at home, she said.

   For $18, a family gets a 1-day-old turkey chick. For the next

   After five months, the 16- to 35-pound turkeys are sent to a

<HEAD>Reagan Says Dukakis Victory Would Handicap Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan promised today to do
``everything I can'' to help George Bush win the presidency and
added that ``I'll be pretty handicapped'' if Bush should lose to
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Reagan, assessing the Democrats, said he had ``great
disagreement'' with Jesse Jackson's policies but thought Jackson
had proven himself ``a viable candidate'' through the primary
season.
   He gave a back-handed slap at Dukakis when he was asked how he'd
advise Bush to deal with his underdog status in the polls.
   ``I'd say, `George, wait until you and I get out there on the
trail and start pinning him down on the things he claims, which we
know are not true,'' Reagan said, adding they would then list their
own accomplishments.
   He said of Dukakis, ``You know, if I listen to him long enough,
I would be convinced that we're in an economic downturn, and that
people are homeless, and people are going without food and medical
attention, and that we've got to do something about the
unemployed.''
   Reagan said he hoped the election ``goes the way I'd like it to
go'' and that Bush will be the one to succeed him.
   ``I'll be pretty handicapped if it goes one way,'' Reagan said,
in an apparent reference to a possible Dukakis victory. He had been
asked how he planned to deal with his successor about matters that
he had been unable to accomplish during his term of office.
   He commented during a question-and-answer session with regional
reporters, one day after Dukakis clinched enough delegates for the
Democratic nomination.
   Reagan made several laudatory comments about his vice president
and said at one point, ``He's been a part of everything we've
accomplished in this administration.''
   The president appeared unconcerned about recent attempts by Bush
to distance himself from the administration's policies.
   In particular, Reagan was asked to respond to comments the vice
president made about the Soviet Union that seemed at odds with
Reagan's more positive assessments voiced at the Moscow summit.
   ``No, he's being as careful as we all must be,'' Reagan said.
   Asked about Jackson's candidacy, Reagan said, ``There's no
question that he has impressed a great number of followers.''
   ``And I want to say without any inference to any racial
difference or anything, I would have to say I find myself in great
disagreement with policies that he has proposed as well as those of
the other candidate, Dukakis,'' Reagan said.
   He added that such disagreement ``goes with the game'' and that
``they obviously have different goals in mind than we have.

that Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter and two other defendants
each be tried separately so they can defend themselves using each
other's congressional testimony given under a grant of limited
immunity.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh to decide whether he wants to try North or
Poindexter in the first of four trials.
   The other two defendants, Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim,
would be tried later.
   Gesell also said the trials should be held in Washington,
rejecting a defense argument that the pretrial publicity has
damaged the defendants' right to a fair trial.
   The defendants had urged a separate trial on grounds that the
immunized testimony included information that would prove their
innocence. For instance, Secord has said that testimony by North
would show that money from U.S. arms sales to Iran belonged to
Secord's business enterprise rather than the U.S. government as the
indictment charged.
   While North's testimony could not be used in his own trial, it
could be used in Secord's, and vice-versa.
   Gesell said that ``any defendant should have considerable leeway
to use indirectly...and possibly directly immunized testimony while
defending the charges against him.''
   He said the right to a fair trial ``cannot be preserved if any
two defendants are tried together.''
   Walsh is barred from using the defendants' immunized
congressional testimony as evidence against them even though the
defendants can use it themselves.
   Outside the courthouse, Walsh declined to comment on the judge's
decision except to say that ``everyone realizes that four trials
are more burdensome than one but the judge feels that that's a
necessary requirement to protect the constitutional rights of all
four defendants.''
   Walsh declined to say whether North of Poindexter would be tried
first. Gesell gave the prosecutor until Friday to make his decision.
   Gesell said defendants at criminal trials are ``afforded the
powerful weapon of cross-examination, an essential part of our
adversarial system.''
   ``Cross-examination is an effective means of ensuring the truth
will prevail before a jury. It's a precious constitutional right,''
the judge said.
   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers
helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect'' of the
case, Gesell said.
   ``Each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony of
other witnesses,'' Gesell said.
   The judge said Congress had a legitimate interest in conducting
the hearings but he noted that questioning of North, Poindexter and
Hakim was ``in a highly accusatory context spiked with accusation
of criminal impropriety.''
   In arguments before the decision, Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer
for Walsh, said that publicity, while extensive, has often favored
the defendants.
   He said ``Colonel North is on the lecture circuit and receives
$20,000 a lecture. He certainly doesn't carry a stigma that would
be prejudicial in this case.''
   Any evidence of pre-trial prejudice, he said, should be tested
``against real people who step into the jury box.''
   And he added, ``We don't think any political considerations
ought to enter into fixing a trial date.''
   Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's attorney, argued that the
Iran-Contra affair will play a major role in the presidential
campaign, especially as questions are raised about Vice President
George Bush's role.
   ``It would be a travesty to have this case proceed under that
glare and spotlight,'' he said.
   North, Poindexter, Secord and Hakim are charged in a 23-count
indictment with conspiring to illegally divert profits from sale of
arms to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Other counts involve
obstruction of presidential and congressional investigations of the
Iran-Contra affair, and theft of U.S. government property.
   Beckler said the Iran-Contra case, unlike the Watergate scandal,
saw the public exposed to massive amounts of information from
Congress and the Reagan administration that would not be admissible
at trial.
   And he said the congressional hearings on Watgergate were held
when it was not certain there would be criminal prosecutions.
   In the Iran-Contra case, Beckler said, the independent counsel
already was preparing his case as Congress was receiving testimony
under grants of limited immunity against prosecution _ information
that will not be used at trial.
   Gesell assured Beckler, ``If these men are convicted, they're
not going to be convicted by pre-trial publicity. That can be
assured.

   An Arab died after being beaten by Israeli
troops, a hospital official said Wednesday, and the army reportedly
stepped up protection for Israeli-appointed Arab officials after
the stabbing of a West Bank mayor.
   Soldiers, meanwhile, shot and wounded four Palestinians on
Wednesday during clashes in a West Bank refugee camp and village,
hospital officials said. The army confirmed three of the shootings.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured the Gaza Strip on
Wednesday and told residents who complained about the presence of
soldiers that troops would leave if Arab protests calmed down.
   ``We don't want to keep the army here any more than we have
to,'' Rabin said on Israel radio. ``If there is quiet, there will
be fewer problems, fewer beatings.''
   Doctors at Shifa hospital in Gaza City said Hussein Jama Abu
Jallalah, 19, died late Tuesday after being beaten in the head a
day earlier in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a frequent site of
violence. The army confirmed the death but said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   Dr. Ahmed Yassih said Abu-Jallalah was admitted to the hospital
with a ``very bad head injury. He had contusions and lacerations
all over the body, and fractures on the left leg and right hand.''
He said the young man died at Tel Aviv's Tel Hashomer Hospital,
where he was transferred after suffering a brain hemorrhage.
   The death raised to 202 the number of Palestinians killed during
the six-month Arab uprising. Two Israelis have also died.
   In scattered violence Wednesday, troops shot and wounded a
stone-throwing Arab protester in the Balata refugee camp near
Nablus and two others in the nearby village of Beit Farouk, the
army said. Officials at the Al Ittihad hospital said three were
wounded in Beit Farouk.
   The army imposed a curfew on the West Bank village of Bet Ur et
Tahta after an Israeli motorist was injured there in a firebomb
attack, the military command said.
   The Hebrew daily Maariv said the West Bank military government
was stepping up protection for Israeli-appointed Arab officials
after a stabbing attack Tuesday on Hassan Tawil, the 74-year-old
mayor of El Bireh north of Jerusalem. Tawil was reported in stable
condition Wednesday after suffering a stab wound to the heart.
   Underground leaders of the Arab uprising have repeatedly
demanded that Israeli-appointed mayors and other appointed
officials quit their posts, threatening retaliation if they don't.
   An army spokesman would not comment on reports of stepped up
protection for Arab officials, but Hanna Atrash, the elected Arab
mayor of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, said eight soldiers in
two jeeps offered to protect him Wednesday morning.
   He said he refused help from the soldiers and added: ``I also
told them they are hurting me more than they are helping me.''
   In Tel Aviv, a group of Israelis and Palestinians on Wednesday
announced plans to repair houses in the West Bank village of Beita,
where the Israeli army destroyed homes after a teen-aged Jewish
girl was killed in a confrontation with Arab residents April 6.
   Jewish settlers initially claimed the girl was shot by an Arab.
But an army report later showed Tirza Porat was accidentally shot
by an Israeli guard who accompanied Jewish teen-agers on a hike in
the area.
   ``We felt it was one of the most outrageous incidents in the
whole uprising in which the army retaliated unnecessarily,''
Professor Yosef Grajinsky, a member of the new Committee for Beita,
said of the house demolitions.
   The committee said it sent nine architects to assess damage in
the village and also hired lawyers to represent residents jailed
after the incident.
   Azmet Bishara, a Palestinian member of the group, said the
architects found $160,000 in damage done to 20 houses in the course
of the destruction of 14 other homes. Israel has frequently
demolished homes in retaliation for attacks on its soldiers or
Israeli civilians.

   The Rev. C. Kenneth Hall was elected today to
lead the nation's largest Presbyterian denomination through its
bicentennial year.
   Hall, a 63-year-old minister from Butler, Pa., was selected over
four other candidates on the first ballot by the 630 commissioners,
or delegates, to the 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.).
   Hall will be chief spokesman for the 3 million-member
denomination for the following year.
   Hall received 319 votes. Other candidates were the Revs.
Juventino R. Ballesteros, 54, of Savannah, Ga., 133 votes; James R.
Struthers, 66, of Stillwater, Okla., 30; Roy H. Zuefeldt, 63, of
Abilene, Texas, 79; and James Spalding, 66, professor of religion
at the University of Iowa, 64.
   After today's election, the commissioners moved into committee
meetings to discuss various issues, incluing a report saying
pornography debases God's gifts and is ``far from the mutual sexual
delight depicted biblically.''
   ``Pornography: Far From the Song of Songs'' recommends, among
other things, that members of the church boycott materials and
companies that market or produce pornographic materials.
   The pornography report's title refers to ``The Song of
Solomon,'' an Old Testament book that contains some of the most
sexually explict language in the Bible.
   Some critics, however, say the paper does not go far enough in
condemning pornography.
   Sharlyn Stare, who heads a special Presbyterian committee on
pornography in Cincinnati, said the ``recommendations need to be
more aggressive to moving people to support prosecution of illegal
obscenity and child pornography.''
   Other reports include a paper entitled ``Christian Obedience in
a Nuclear Age,'' which declares that nuclear war and the theory of
nuclear deterrence are immoral and calls on Presbyterians to be
more active in the fight for peace.
   While the paper stops short of calling for a denominational
position of civil disobedience, it calls for the support of those
who feel compelled to engage in resistance and recommends
establishing a fund to support resisters.
   Anti-abortion groups within the church are also hoping to
persuade the commissioners to toughen the church's stance against
abortion.
   The reports will be considered by the commissioners at committee
meetings on Thursday and Friday. The commissions reassemble
Saturday to deal with the reports.
   The meeting runs through next Wednesday.
   As part of the anti-abortion effort, Presbyterians Pro-Life
sponsored a visit here Tuesday by Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who
called abortion the ``greatest destroyer of love and peace.''
   ``If I had power, I would open a jail and put every single
doctor in jail for killing life, killing a child, a gift of God,''
said the Nobel Peace Prize winner who is noted for her work with
the poor.
   ``Every single child, every unborn child in the womb, is
precious to Him, is created for greater things, to love and be
loved,'' she said in a speech to about 600 people, including
commissioners and St. Louis Roman Catholic Archbishop John L. May.
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has condemned abortion as a
method of birth control, but said the decision rests with the
woman, her physician and God.
   Presbyterians Pro-Life wants the church to condemn abortion in
all instances except where the mother's life is in danger.
   The denomination was formed by the 1983 merger of the United
Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, which was the
principal denomination in the North, and the Presbyterian Church in
the United States, which was the principal southern body. The
merger healed a split over slavery stemming from the Civil War.
   There are seven smaller Presbyterian groups in the United States.

<HEAD>Informant: Regulations Don't Hinder Drug Smugglers Using Small
Planes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug smugglers using small planes easily evade
federal rules requiring the registration of aircraft and pilots, a
government informant told Congress on Wednesday.
   The witness, testifying from behind a screen and identified only
as the former bookkeeper of an international drug ring, said the
federal registration rules were ``very easy to beat. Nothing to
it.''
   The witness told the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee of airplane bills of sale that never were sent to the
Federal Aviation Administration, of fictitious names and addresses
reported for buyers and sellers, and of signatures scrawled
illegibly on FAA forms and modifications _ such as installation of
long-range fuel tanks _ that went unreported to the government.
   The FAA did not pursue such gaps in documentation and in some
cases required no records that would make it easier to track down
aircraft owners and pilots, the witness said.
   ``I didn't see a vast amount of brilliance in the smuggling
community,'' said the man, who was referred to by the legislators
as ``Mr. Smith.'' ``If you give them an opportunity to make
mistakes and leave a paper trail, it seems to me they'll make
mistakes and leave a paper trail.''
   Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said
64 percent of the cocaine and marijuana seized in the United States
last year was captured on small planes owned by individuals or
businesses. He cited a report by the Office of Technology
Assessment, a research arm of Congress, that estimated that there
are 1,300 to 3,500 drug-smuggling flights by small planes entering
the country annually.
   In what has been the usual procedure in the spate of drug
hearings held by Congress during this election year, the witness
was accompanied by several armed Capitol police officers who stood
guard inside and outside the hearing room.
   The man said he was a former member of the federal witness
protection program and was on probation after pleading guilty to
state charges of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and racketeering.
   He said he had worked for a ``loose confederation'' of
Americans, Colombians, Bahamians and others who smuggled cocaine
into the United States aboard aircraft. He was responsible for the
registration and ownership documents of more than 40 planes used by
the participants, some used for legitimate businesses they owned
and others for smuggling.
   To disguise the planes' ownership, the witness said he often had
foreigners sign registration forms and use difficult to trace
American mailing addresses. He would at times use addresses of
apartment complexes without supplying apartment numbers, and
arrange to have people who lived at the complexes watch for piles
of undelivered mail and relay it.
   The witness also said mechanics who modified the planes he used
often knew why the equipment was being installed on the aircraft.
   ``As a result, they had no interest in making any documentation
of the work which they would have had to sign, for fear of
jeopardizing their licenses,'' he said.
   At the same hearing, four drug investigators complained that
they were frequently hindered by federal regulations that made it
possible for smugglers to hide their identities.
   ``Aircraft identification and registered owner identification is
an elusive veil behind which the smuggler finds refuge,'' said
Carol Knapik, an undercover detective in the Broward County, Fla.,
sheriff's office. She also testified from behind screens.
   Janet Hale, an assistant secretary of the Department of
Transportation, told the lawmakers that the FAA was trying to
improve its registration systems so it could provide more
information to law enforcement agencies.
   The public works committee is considering legislation that would
require the FAA to improve its record-keeping system.

   California voters said no to quarantining
AIDS sufferers, kept the Rancho Seco nuclear plant alive and
refused to form their first new county in 80 years, while sending
mixed signals on taxes and growth in the most populous state.
   With all but a handful of Tuesday's votes counted, voters
rejected Propositions 71 and 72, both aimed at relaxing state
spending limits.
   Proposition 71, which would have allowed government to spend
more money, was defeated 49 percent to 51 percent. Proposition 72,
designed to modify the limit to allow the gasoline sales tax to be
spent on highway construction, was turned down 38 percent to 68
percent.
   The ceiling, approved in 1979 after voters slashed taxes with
Proposition 13, ties annual expenditures to population growth and
the cost of living.
   Proposition 69, the AIDS measure backed by extremist Lyndon
LaRouche, was defeated by a 68 percent to 32 percent margin. It
called for adding AIDS to the state list of communicable diseases,
giving officials the right to quarantine patients and those testing
positive for the virus. A similar proposal was rejected at the
polls 18 months ago.
   San Bernardino County voters opposed by a two-thirds majority
the creation of an 18,160-square-mile Mojave County. The county
would have been the state's largest, claiming 90 percent of the
land in San Bernardino County but just 20 percent of its residents.
   The Rancho Seco plant won a reprieve from the wrecking ball.
Voters in Sacramento County and part of Placer County narrowly
approved a measure, backed by a $1.4 million campaign by the
nuclear energy industry, to give plant managers 18 months to iron
out problems that have caused more than 100 outages since it opened
in 1974. The vote was 51.6 percent in favor and 48.4 percent
opposed.
   An opposing measure, which would have turned off the reactor for
good, lost by an even narrower margin _ 49.6 percent in favor to
50.4 percent opposed.
   Voters also approved two measures to control on campaign
spending.
   Proposition 68, aimed at limiting contributions to legislative
candidates, was approved 53 percent to 47 percent. Proposition 73,
which limits contributions in all state and local races and
prohibits public campaign financing, won the support of 58 percent
of the voters.
   Under state law, since Proposition 73 won by a greater margin
than 68, its provisions will supersede Proposition 68 in areas
where the two conflict.
   Voters statewide showed they were ready to spend money for some
projects. They said yes to an $800 million school bond issue, 65
percent to 35 percent; approved a bond issue to fund housing loans
for veterans, 68 percent to 32 percent; OK'd a $150 million bond
issue to fund reinforcement of masonry apartment buildings which
could tumble in an earthquake; and also backed a $776 million bond
issue for purchase and development of parks and land supporting
endangered species, 65 percent to 35 percent.
   Proposition 74, a $1 billion bond issue to build and improve
state highways, was too close to call, with ``yes'' and ``no''
votes separated by about 10,000 out of more than 5 million cast.
The outcome might not be known until July 5, when the official vote
count is released.
   Measures aimed at slowing growth met mixed receptions. Orange
County's Measure A, the most sweeping, was opposed by 55.7 percent
of voters and favored by 44.3 percent. The initiative aimed to
limit growth depending on the impact it would have on roads,
emergency services, flood control and parks.
   Growth-related measures passed in the Southern California
communities of Irvine, Hemet, San Clemente and San Marcos. But
measures in the Los Angeles suburbs of Manhattan Beach and Pasadena
were defeated easily.
   Voters in San Francisco split on two measures aimed at reducing
the city's expected $179 million deficit. They passed Proposition
B, calling for a one-year freeze on wage hikes for city employees,
with 78 percent in favor and just 22 percent opposed. But they
turned down Proposition K, which would have lifted the
state-imposed limit on spending, defeating it by 56 percent to 44
percent.
   Mayor Art Agnos said Wednesday that he would have to lay off 356
employees, close three fire stations and cut health srvices.
   Taking advantage of a state law passed last year allowing all
counties to raise the sales tax for transportation and permitting
the 46 smallest counties to use the money for general needs, four
counties approved half-cent increases. But six said no to a sales
tax hike.

   Airborne computers will send more easily
understood data back from inside hurricanes this year, helping
ground-based meteorologists better track and predict the giant
storms.
   In the past, the weather information radioed back from research
aircraft has had to undergo analysis on the ground before it could
be used in storm reports and studies. Now, some of that work will
be done aboard the airplane itself.
   ``The real benefit involved in doing this is that the forecaster
on the ground will be seeing things in the data almost as quickly
as the observer on the airplane,'' explained Dr. Stanley Rosenthal,
director of the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration in Key Biscayne, Fla.
   ``Over the years it's become apparent that people on the
(research) plane are able see things, important things, that
forecasters on the ground ought to be able to see,'' he said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``This has not been possible before, but now we are able to
provide the man on the ground with information almost as quickly as
on those on the aircraft,'' he said.
   While information such as the wind speed and direction,
temperature and rainfall may seem simple, instruments collecting
this data don't necessarily provide it in simple numerical form,
Rosenthal said.
   Past practice has been for the various electronic readings to be
radioed back to the ground, where they were converted to numerical
readings and then combined for use in research and forecasting.
   The new system _ tried experimentally last year _ uses a new
computer on the NOAA P-3 Orion aircraft to quickly convert the
instrument readings to usable data and combine the numbers in
various ways to make them mose useful to forecasters on the ground.
   That means that as the plane flies through the storm its will be
sending back a steady stream of data on the state of the hurricane
itself, its direction of movement and any changes, according to Dr.
Hugh Willoughby, also of the Hurricane Research Division.
   The information is sent from the aircraft to satellites and then
returns to the ground at the NOAA satellite station at Wallops
Island, Va. From there is is transmitted both to the researchers in
Key Biscayne and to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in
nearby Coral Gables.
   Much of the information will continue to be sent in the
traditional manner, Rosenthal said.
   But the new system will be used, in addition, for factors which
tend to influence the development and movement of the storms.
   Among the most important of these is the exact location of the
hurricane'e eye, which it is vital to know in order to predict the
movement of the storm. Willoughby said an error of as little as 30
miles in locating the eye _ the relatively calm center of the storm
_ can make a vast difference in determining what coastal under is
under threat and how soon landfall is likely.

   Military police in Uganda killed 200
soldiers and detained 700 after an April mutiny at two barracks and
an attempt to assassinate President Yoweri Museveni, Ugandan
military sources said Wednesday.
   Military headquarters in Kampala had ordered local journalists
not to report the mutiny and several people had been detained in
the capital for discussing it publicly, said officers in the
Ugandan army who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At least 200 mutineers of the 19th Artillery Regiment and the
8th Infantry Battalion were slain in clashes with 3,000 loyal
troops April 7-8 before rebel units surrendered, the sources said.
The two units are based near the Ugandan capital of Kampala.
   About 700 mutineers were captured and detained by military
police at Luzira prison in Kampala, they said.
   On April 11, the presidential convoy was ambushed on the 22-mile
highway from Kampala to the State House in Entebbe. Mutineers
killed at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of three
military trucks, the sources said.
   But Museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car.
He had flown by helicopter from Kampala to the State House and
evidently had sent the seven-vehicle convoy along the road without
him, the sources said.
   The attackers escaped.
   The sources said they belong to a group of dissident officers
wanting Museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies,
improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 Libyan and 250 North
Korean military instructors from the former British colony in East
Africa.
   They said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling Museveni.
   The military command in Kampala, contacted by telephone from
Nairobi, would not confirm or deny the reports.
   Telephones at State House alternately went unanswered or were
busy.
   There have been no previous reported attempts to assassinte
Museveni, who seized power Jan. 27, 1986, ending a five-year bush
war against civilian President Milton Obote and the military junta
that ousted Obote in July 1985.
   The sources said the captives had not been ill-treated and would
be sent to re-education camps at Entebbe, Kyankwanzi west of
Kampala and Mobuku near the Zaire border. The government set up the
camps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed into
the army or allowed to return to civilian life.
   Soldiers loyal to Obote and other toppled Ugandan leaders,
including military dictator Idi Amin, have mounted insurgencies
since August 1986 and Museveni's National Resistance Army has been
battling several rebel groups.
   On Saturday, Museveni signed a peace agreement with the
commander of the largest rebel group, Lt. Col. John Angelo Okello
of the northern-based Uganda People's Democratic Army. But Eric
Otema Allimadi, the rebels' leader in exile in London, rejected the
accord in advance.
   Museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement with
a smaller rebel group fighting in the east, the Uganda People's
Army.

   U.S. authorities on Wednesday
displayed for the first time some of the 859 U.S. medium-range
nuclear missiles to be destroyed under the superpower arms accord
put into effect at the Moscow summit.
   Reporters, including some from the Soviet Union and other East
bloc nations, viewed missiles or missile-firing equipment at four
of the 12 sites in Western Europe covered by the missile agreement.
   Soviet officials are due to begin inspecting the missile bases,
plus 14 sites in the United States, as early as July 1. U.S.
inspectors have a reciprocal right to check 133 sites, including
126 in the Soviet Union, six in East Germany and one in
Czechoslovakia.
   On June 3, the Soviets invited 43 Western journalists to the
Sarny military base in the northern republic of Ukraine to show how
their SS-20 missile transports and launchers will be eliminated
under the same treaty.
   The inspections are a first step toward the destruction, by
1991, of all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces, as called for in the INF treaty that took effect
June 1.
   Lothar Ruehl, a state secretary in the West German Defense
Ministry, told a media tour of a missile site near the West German
town of Schwaebisch Gmuend that the first of 132 Pershing 2
missiles deployed in his country would be dismantled in September.
The 132 Pershing 2s include 24 spares, U.S. officials said.
   West Germany and Britain received the first batch of U.S.
missiles in November 1983 amid widespread public protests in Europe.
   Later, cruise missiles were deployed in Italy and Belgium. The
Netherlands had been designated to take 48 missiles this year but
that was canceled by the signing of the INF treaty in December.
   Using unarmed Pershing 2 rockets, U.S. soldiers at the base in
Germany demonstrated how the missiles will be taken apart and
crated before being shipped to the United States for final
destruction.
   The destructive power of the 50-kiloton warheads carried by the
Pershing 2 missiles is equivalent to 50,000 tons of TNT, or 2{
times the explosive power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
   The U.S. cruise missiles carry 200-kiloton warheads.
   Reporters at the cruise missile bases in Belgium and Britain
were not allowed to see any missiles. They were shown an example of
the metal canisters in which the rockets are stored, as well as the
launchers and the portable trailers from which a launching would be
triggered.
   Reporters in Belgium also were taken to the European Repair
Facility, near the city of Charleroi, where the sleek, gray-colored
cruise missiles are repaired. Several unarmed missiles were shown
to reporters.
   At the 485th U.S. Tactical Missile Wing near Florennes, Belgium,
U.S. officials gave reporters a sample of the briefing that Soviet
inspection teams are to receive before they tour the base,
including diagrams of the protected bunker where 16 cruise missiles
are kept.
   Under terms of the INF treaty, Soviet and U.S. officials can
arrive for inspections of each other's bases with as little as 16
hours advance notice.
   The first round of inspections, to be held between July 1 and
Aug. 31, will be ``base-line'' checks to verify that missiles and
other items covered by the treaty are in order before dismantling
begins.
   At Greenham Common in Britain, where 101 cruise missiles are
based, U.S. officials showed reporters their preparations for the
first inspections.
   ``I'm ready for the Soviets to come now,'' said Col. William E.
Jones, the base commander.
   U.S. soldiers in camouflaged, eight-wheel trucks drove the
55-foot long missile launchers _ minus the missiles _ along muddy
lanes on Greenham Common, which is about 50 miles west of London.
   Once they arrive at Florennes, the Soviet inspectors will be put
up in a brown-brick, two-story domitory near the center of the
base. They also will be given meals and office space on the base,
officials said.
   Col. Calvin Chasteen, commander of the U.S. base at Florennes,
declined to say when the cruise missiles would be dismantled or how
the base would be used after the missiles were gone. The base was
opened in 1984 and much of it is still under construction.
   Chasteen said ``many'' of the 1,300 U.S. soldiers at the base
would be reassigned to the United States. He did not say how many.
Others would be transferred to U.S. Air Force facilities elsewhere
in Europe.
   Guy Coeme, the Belgian defense miniter, told reporters he hoped
the missiles, which arrived at Florenne in March 1985, could be
dismantled and removed by December or January. He would not be more
specific.

LaRouche that could subject AIDS victims to potential quarantine by
declaring AIDS a communicable disease.
   Spending Limits _ Voters defeated measures to ease spending
limits Californians placed on state government in 1979.
   Campaign Spending _ Voters approved a proposition to limit
contributions in legislative races and create a system of public

<HEAD>Crops Under Stress as Drought Continues</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity traders cast a wary eye skyward, lawn-sprinkling
patrols cruised Chicago's suburbs and an Atlanta-area fire chief
worried about dry hydrants as a crop-searing drought tightened its
grip Wednesday on the Midwest and portions of the Southeast.
   Worse yet, the National Weather Service said relief would be
both temporary and spotty at least until next week.
   The rainfall shortage translated into nothing more serious than
a call for conservation measures in many communities, but some
farmers already face worse.
   ``Lawns turn brown but they don't die,'' Al Bergquist, who owns
farmland near Elburn, Ill., said after hearing complaints about
lawn-watering restrictions on a radio call-in show. ``But that's
what farmers face, and she's worried about her yard.''
   A thunderstorm dumped nearly 2 inches of rain on much of Iowa
overnight, ``but that band of showers isn't packing enough punch
for most of the other states it will reach,'' said meteorologist
Alan Morrison of the weather service's Chicago office.
   And the service is calling for a return to warm, dry conditions
for most of the affected areas by the weekend.
   ``We've had a low pressure system that for some reason has
hovered over the Northeast for most of the spring,'' said Morrison.
``That has meant cool, wet weather there and unseasonably dry
weather almost everywhere else.''
   More than six weeks of lower-than-normal rainfall recorded
across much of the nation's corn- and soybean-growing regions in
the Midwest have pushed the futures prices of those commodities to
four-year highs.
   Traders, in turn, have become so edgy that the single band of
thundershowers that visited Iowa late Tuesday was enough to cause
Wednesday morning prices to open sharply lower.
   ``At these price levels,'' said Richard Loewy, a New York-based
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., ``everyone's going
to be extremely nervous.''
   If it doesn't rain soon, farmers in southern Indiana may face
the worst spring drought in 25 years, said Jack Washburn, Harrison
County extension agent.
   An additional 60 counties in Indiana were declared federal
disaster areas Wednesday because of drought conditions; 24 were so
declared earlier this week, leaving only eight of the state's 92
counties off the disaster list.
   The federal government's decision to place counties on the list
_ Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa each now have more than three dozen
counties under the declaration _ permits haying or grazing on land
normally set aside as part of a crop-reduction plan.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich asked the federal government Tuesday
to release nearly 2 million acres the state's farmers have enrolled
in a conservation program.
   In Kentucky, state water officials said the drought is rated
severe in the horse-breeding country around Lexington, and moderate
or mild elsewhere.
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris told a news conference Wednesday
that several years of below-normal rainfall will require careful
resource management for several years to come.
   That situation was dramatized in several subdivisions north of
Atlanta where hydrants ran dry Monday night, prompting Fulton
County Fire Chief James Gibson to say there would have been serious
problems had a major fire broken out.
   Restrictions on watering lawns have been imposed in northern
Fulton County, in Roswell north of Atlanta and in Carrollton near
the Alabama border.
   The same stop-gap measures have been used in Chicago's suburbs
in recent weeks with moderate success.
   Violation of the regulations in affluent, generally green
Naperville west of Chicago, for instance, can bring fines ranging
from $25 for a first offense to $500 for a third. But at least
1,200 have been reported in the last four weeks.

<TEXT>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has charisma, draws
crowds and has two of the most famous names in Mexican history.
   He has just about everything a presidential candidate could want
_ except a realistic chance of winning.
   Nevertheless, Cardenas is galvanizing the normally moribund and
cynical world of Mexican politics with his maverick candidacy. He
has opened fissures and fractures in the base upon which the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party has rested comfortably
for generations.
   Cardenas, 54, is matched against the balding, 40-year-old
technocrat, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is the hand-picked
candidate of the governing party's inner circle.
   That party, known as the PRI, hasn't lost a presidential,
gubernatorial or senatorial contest since its inception in 1929 and
is not expected to so do on July 6.
   The race is about the national mood following a steady erosion
of PRI loyalty and in a time of economic crisis that has lasted
throughout President Miguel de la Madrid's six-year term.
   The pressure from Cardenas on the left, coupled with that from
National Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier on the right, may
force genuine change on the PRI, many analysts and commentators say.
   Cardenas is a political handler's dream. He has experience, good
looks, the ability to stir crowds without stooping to demagogy and
the ability to weather scathing attacks from the pro-government
media. And both of his names are heavy with symbolism.
   His father was Lazaro Cardenas, the beloved reformist president
for the PRI who carried out sweeping land reform and nationalized
Mexico's oil in 1938, ushering in what is called the ``golden age''
of modernization. Cuauhtemoc was Mexico's last Aztec emperor.
   Cardenas has been extraordinarily successful at tapping a rich
vein of dissatisfaction with the status quo.
   He draws large crowds, even in comparison to the carefully
organized PRI rallies. Rapt audiences listen to speeches that
sometimes resemble an almost scholarly discourse _ then break out
in cheers and applause.
   ``The people are with you!'' they chanted at a recent rally.
   The Cardenas message is populist and nationalistic. PRI, he
says, has abandoned the 1910-1921 Mexican Revolution's goals of
social justice and economic equality. Instead, he charges, it
caters to foreign interests and the prosperous Mexican elite that
``collaborates'' with them.
   Cardenas, a PRI senator for many years and former governor of
the central state of Michoacan, broke away from the governing party
last year after it rebuffed his demands for primary elections and
other reforms.
   His campaign under the banner of a coalition called the National
Democratic Front steadily gained momentum. It finally swept the
left, or at least most of it, into a unified front _ long an
elusive goal in Mexican politics.
   ``I can see that the people of Mexico desire change, but not as
profound, as radical as we are offering in the Mexican Socialist
Party,'' said Heberto Castillo, after abandoning his own socialist
candidacy this week in favor of Cardenas. ``Because of this, they
have turned to Cardenas.''
   During the campaign, Cardenas has softened his position on
several key issues, including Mexico's $100 billion foreign debt.
   A new platform calls for suspending payments under the current
terms, instead of a total moratorium. It also calls for reforms in
the judicial system.
   The momentum of Cardenas' campaign reportedly has prompted
debate inside the PRI about how large a victory it can afford
without dangerously alienating a large portion of the electorate
and embarrassing itself worldwide.
   Salinas de Gortari is said to be pushing for a modest margin of
victory while old-line PRI politicos want the usual landslide.
   Cardenas has said, ``The people will recognize the true winner.
They will not acknowledge someone who tries to claim victory
through fraud.''

<HEAD>Wright Asks To Testify Before Ethics Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright said Wednesday he has
asked the ethics committee to invite him to testify so he can
refute charges that he violated conflict of interest rules.
   ``I believe I can put all the allegations to rest,'' said
Wright, D-Texas. ``If the committee will give priority into looking
at each and every (charge) .... it will discover I have violated no
rule and certainly violated no commonly accepted ethical standard.''
   ``I would like for it to be done at the earliest possible
time,'' he said.
   Wright, who has been named chairman of the Democratic National
Convention next month in Atlanta, has called the charges a
Republican attempt to embarrass him and the party. However, the
speaker said Wednesday he has not heard concerns from other
Democrats that the effort could succeed.
   The ethics committee began last week to examine charges against
Wright filed by political enemy Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Common Cause,
a non-profit group which monitors government ethics, also called
for a probe of Wright's actions.
   The panel, still deciding whether to launch a formal inquiry,
planned to meet again on Thursday. Wright was not expected to
testify this week, his office said.
   Gingrich's complaint said Wright violated House rules when he
lobbied on behalf of oil companies in cases in which he had a
financial stake, and in his accepting an unusually large royalty
contract from a friend and campaign contractor who published his
book.
   It was reported this week that Wright's book was written with
considerable help from one of his Capitol Hill employees, including
a taxpayer-financed trip to Texas for the project.
   A top aide to Wright, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday that the speaker's current book project was also
being done with the help of a congressional employee, but he
justified it as commonplace on Capitol Hill.
   ``We wouldn't have given a solitary thought to anything like
this before this big flap came up,'' he said.
   Gingrich said Tuesday that he too had used a staff member to
work on one of his books.
   George Mair, a $65,000-a-year press assistant, is collaborating
with Wright on a book about the speakers of the House through
Congress' first 200 years.
   In an interview earlier this week, Mair insisted he was working
on the book only outside of regular working hours but the source
conceded that work on the book was part of Mair's official duties.
   ``One of the things that's envisioned for him to be doing is to
be working on the book about the speakership,'' he said.
   The speaker is seeking a publisher for the book, and ``four or
five'' have expressed an interest, Mair said.
   Members of Congress frequently have their staffs write speeches
for which the member pockets honoraria, he said, questioning where
the line should be drawn.

   Mayor Art Agnos said Wednesday that voters'
refusal to help fend off a projected $180 million budget deficit by
raising the spending limit will force him to lay off 356 employees,
close three fire stations and cut health services.
   ``I am concerned about it, I'm not frightened by it,'' he said
of the prospective cuts in public safety and health. ``What people
are saying is `We will accept that risk because we don't want to
pay for it.'''
   Proposition K, an override of the state-imposed spending limit
that would have allowed the city to raise and spend $30 million in
additional business, hotel and parking taxes, went down to defeat
in Tuesday's election by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin.
   It would have allowed Agnos to raise the hotel tax from 11
percent to 12 percent, increase the business payroll tax from 1.5
percent to 1.6 percent and levy an annual $200 business
registration fee for small businesses.
   Agnos, who took office early this year, had warned that without
the taxes, which were fiercely opposed by the business community,
he would be forced to lay off police officers and firefighters,
shut down fire stations and reduce health services.
   A special task force of business, labor and union leaders will
meet within the next week to review his recommendations, which will
be discussed in budget hearings by the Board of Supervisors.
   Layoff notices, meanwhile, are scheduled to be mailed out this
week and union officials have threatened lawsuits or ballot
initiatives seeking minimum staffing levels that would prevent some
dismissals.
   Voters apparently bought the anti-Proposition K campaign pitch
that raising the spending limit to an unspecified level would
amount to giving the Board of Supervisors a ``blank check,'' Agnos
said.
   San Franciscans did approve another ballot measure calling for a
wage freeze for police and firefighters to save $10 million, and a
voluntary early retirement plan. They also passed a bond measure to
spend $90 million to improve school facilities.
   Supervisor Bill Maher, a leading opponent of Proposition K,
predicted that Agnos' forecast of cutbacks won't materialize.
Instead, he said, overtime expenses can be reduced and other
portions of the budget that don't affect human services can be
further tightened.
   ``The message is real clear: cut the spending and cut the
government payroll,'' he said.
   San Francisco has more police officers than any county in
California, with 26.7 per 10,000 population.

<HEAD>Dukakis Savors Nomination Lockup, Deflects Jackson Veep Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis collected endorsements from several vanquished
primary rivals on Wednesday as he savored victory in the Democratic
presidential race. Jesse Jackson said his candidacy would ``remain
alive'' even as he solicited an invitation to join the ticket as
vice presidential candidate.
   George Bush, self-described underdog heading into the fall
campaign, received words of encouragement from President Reagan.
The president also threw a jab in Dukakis' direction, saying, ``You
know, if I listen to him long enough, I would be convinced that
we're in an economic downturn, and that people are homeless, and
people are going without food and medical attention, and that we've
got to do something about the unemployed.''
   With the primary season concluded, Dukakis was installed as a
pre-election favorite by Ladbroke's, one of London's leading
bookmakers.
   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole predicted the public
opinion polls would soon ``start moving'' in Bush's direction.
   Dukakis, who tucked away a delegate nominating majority on
Tuesday in the final four primaries of the year, announced in Los
Angeles he was ready to begin looking for a vice presidential
running mate. He praised Jackson, but said neither he nor anyone
else ``is due an offer'' to join the ticket.
   That didn't sound like what Jackson wanted to hear. He said his
constituents had ``earned the option'' of having him considered.
``Consideration means an offer. It does not mean just in passing,''
he said.
   He later added that for some people ``maybe the vice presidency
may be a step down.'' He added, ``You understand my background? The
vice presidency is not the top but it is a long where from where I
started.''
   The contrast between Jackson on the one hand and former Dukakis
rivals Sen. Paul Simon, Rep. Richard Gephardt and Bruce Babbitt on
the other couldn't have been plainer.
   Simon of Illinois called a news conference in Washington to
declare that the ``verdict is in'' and he would do ``everything I
can'' to help elect the man from Massachusetts.
   Former Arizona Gov. Babbitt offered his backing in a televised
interview in California. ``It's time to come together,'' he said.
``He's a good man and I'll endorse him.''
   Gephardt arranged to bestow his blessing publicly when Dukakis'
chartered campaign jet touched down in St. Louis for a refueling
stop en route to Boston.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo offered an endorsement, as well, in
one of the great anticlimaxes of the campaign. Cuomo once was the
subject of almost daily rumors that he would make a belated entry
into the campaign, and for months his endorsement was coveted by
all the active candidates.
   ``I endorse him, I endorse him, I endorse him,'' Cuomo told
persistent reporters.
   But Jackson sent alternately complimentary and confrontational
signals to Dukakis. He said whatever differences exist between them
``can be resolved,'' adding, ``Both of us are rational. Both of us
are intelligent. Both of us want to win.''
   At the same time, he said his campaign would ``remain alive''
until the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month. He
said he would continue to seek delegates and dispatched top aides
to Mackinac Island, Mich. for a Democratic Party platform committee
drafting session.
   As for the vice presidential nomination, the man who finished
second in dozens of primaries and caucuses tried to make it sound
like he had earned it.
   Asked if he would accept the spot if it were offered _ a
possibility that some Dukakis aides dismiss as wildly improbable _
Jackson said, ``That's a decision I must make at that time. I've
not made the decision yet whether I'll accept it or not.''
   In an interview with ABC, he said, ``Consideration does mean an
offer, it does not mean just in passing. We have earned
consideration.''
   Dukakis seemed to stiffen in response.
   He agreed that Jackson had earned consideration but said ``I
don't think anyone is due an offer.''
   ``But there are a great many people that are going to be
considered and he'll be one of them and I'm not going to rule
anybody in or out at this point,'' he said in a taped interview
with ABC.
   Reagan was asked by reporters at the White House what sort of
advice he would give to Bush in his race with Dukakis.
   ``I'd say, George, wait until you and I get out there on the
trail, and start pinning him down on the things he claims, which we
know are not true,'' he replied.
   Senate Republican leader Dole combined a prediction of a
turnaround in the polls with an attack on Dukakis.
   ``The Dukakis record stands alone and the American people don't
like what they see. It's the same out-of-touch liberal agenda that
America buried in the 1980 and 1984 landslides,'' he said.
   Reflecting a view held by many Republican strategists, Dole
added that Dukakis has benefited in recent weeks from being
perceived as a moderate in contrast to Jackson.
   ``But that won't sell anymore,'' he said. ``Watch, the polls
will start moving in Bush's direction.''

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush are starting
to get serious about choosing running mates, with Dukakis facing an
increasingly insistent Jesse Jackson who says he has earned
consideration for the job and ``consideration means an offer.''
   Dukakis quickly rejected that notion on Wednesday.
   ``I don't think anyone is due an offer. But there are a great
many people that are going to be considered and he'll be one of
them,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Dukakis locked up the Democratic presidential nomination in
Tuesday's final primaries, setting up his fall matchup with Bush,
who has had the GOP nomination in hand since late April.
   Clinching the nomination freed Dukakis to finally admit he is
thinking about a running mate, while Bush has been holding private
talks on the matter for several weeks. For both, picking a vice
presidential nominee is the next step in building what they hope
will be an Electoral College majority in November.
   The vice president, trailing in the polls, has made it clear he
will be happy to let Dukakis go first, an option granted him by the
calendar.
   Dukakis must make his choice in time for it to be ratified by
the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July. The No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket does not have to be filled until almost a
month later, when the Republicans gather in New Orleans.
   In the past week, Jackson has marched firmly to the front of the
line of Democratic politicians asking for consideration for a spot
on the ticket. On Wednesday, he went further, contending that his
second-place finish in the Democratic race means he deserves to
actually be offered the No. 2 spot.
   ``Consideration does mean an offer; it does not mean just in
passing,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson adviser Ann Lewis put it this way: ``It is essential
that any short list begin with Jackson. And it is essential that
the decision be made with him _ not just communicated to him after
it is made.''
   Dukakis didn't agree that Jackson must be given an offer.
   ``I think he's due consideration and there are other people who
deserve consideration as well,'' Dukakis said. ``He himself has
said that it's up to the nominee to pick his running mate and I
agree with him.''
   There is substantial resistance in the party to Jackson.
   ``Jesse on the ticket would destroy it,'' said veteran New York
activist and labor lawyer Charles Torche. ``There are still a lot
of black haters out there.''
   Dukakis is getting a lot of advice to pick a Southerner to help
him in that region or to at least choose a moderate senator such as
John Glenn of Ohio.
   ``With the proper running mate, the South will be for Dukakis,''
said Arkansas Democratic Party executive director Kip Blakely.
``What he needs is a Southern senator.''
   In addition to Glenn, other possible vice presidential choices
include Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Bob Graham of Florida, Lloyd Bensten of Texas, Sam Nunn of
Georgia and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas.
   Jackson had a quick retort to those who are pushing Southern
senators, laying out his primary record in the region.
   ``No senator, no congressperson can match those credentials. I
heard someone say earlier today we need somebody from the South.
Well, I'm from the South, someone who can win in the South; I won
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana.''
   While Dukakis wrestles with the Jackson problem, Bush faces a
big deficit in the polls, particularly among the nation's women.
   And that may suggest that Bush could pick a woman for the
Republican ticket _ breaking down a historic barrier in the party.
   ``I wouldn't want to use the word `desperation,' but that is the
high-risk, high roll scenario,'' said New York pollster Lee
Miringoff.
   Among female candidates most frequently mentioned by Bush
advisers are Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois.
   ``Women are not dopes. You don't buy off women with tricks,''
said Martin, the national co-chair of the Bush campaign. ``I think
he should have a very good vice president and that may very well be
a woman. ... The fact that it's being mentioned diminishes the
misconception that conservatives are somehow against the
advancement of women.''
   While Dukakis is being urged to look south, Bush, too, has heard
geographic arguments.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian is the most often mentioned
Westerner, but such a selection could cost the GOP control of the
Statehouse. Bush aides have also mentioned Sens. Alan Sim, William L. Armstrong
of Colorado and James McClure of
Idaho, as well as Rep. Richard Cheney of Wyoming.
   Southerners mentioned at times include White House Chief of
Stapson of
Wyomingff Howard Baker and Lamar Alexander, both from Tennessee. Govs.
Thomas Kean of New Jersey, Jim Thompson of Illinois and John Sununu
of New Hampshire are also named as potential nominees.
   From the Midwest _ a longtime GOP stronghold now moving to the
Democrats _ Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas is prominently discussed. But
Dole illustrates the benefits and dangers of a geographic focus to
the choice.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo finally endorsed
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for the Democratic presidential
nomination on Wednesday but continued to insist his support was
``never relevant.''
   A day earlier, by winning the lion's share of delegates in the
final four primaries, Dukakis wrapped up the nomination.
   Cuomo also said he felt Jesse Jackson could be a plus for the
Democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate, but said he
hadn't discussed that with Dukakis.
   Cuomo's public endorsement of Dukakis came only after some
semantic tooth-pulling by reporters at a news conference.
   When Cuomo revealed that he had talked to Dukakis on Wednesday
morning, reporters asked the New York governor if they had talked
about an endorsement. Cuomo brushed the question aside.
   ``For months, I said I was for whoever comes out of the primary
process first ... so that was a fait accompli as soon as the
primaries were over,'' said Cuomo.
   Pressed on the point, Cuomo said, ``It's an empty question. I
gave the endorsement months ago to whoever came out first. My
endorsement was never relevant.''
   ``Why can't you bring yourself to say that you endorse him?''
one exasperated reporter finally asked.
   ``I endorse him! I endorse him! I endorse him,'' shot back Cuomo
as laughter swept through the news conference. ``There, three times
I endorsed him.''
   In the days leading up to New York's crucial April 19
presidential primary, Cuomo announced that he would not endorse any
of the candidates until after the primary season ended. After that,
Cuomo said he would get behind the front-runner help him secure the
nomination.
   At the time, some speculated that Cuomo might be hoping for a
deadlocked convention that might then turn to him with the
nomination. Cuomo denied that and insisted he had ruled out any
convention draft.
   The New York governor repeated his assertion that Jackson could
be good for the Democratic ticket.
   ``Certainly, he could be good for the ticket,'' said Cuomo.
``How could you say no? All those millions of people who voted for
him thought he was better than Gore, better than (former Arizona
Gov. Bruce) Babbitt, better than (Delaware Sen. Joseph) Biden,
better than (Illinois Sen. Paul) Simon. How could you say he
wouldn't be good for the ticket?''

   The movement to reform the Soviet legal system has
not led to necessary changes in laws regarding Jewish emigration,
attorneys from the International Bar Association said on Wednesday.
   One attorney, Joseph Smukler of Philadelphia, said Soviet ideas
on Jewish emigration amount to ``empty words and empty promises.''
He made the comment Wednesday at a news conference with Jewish
refuseniks at a Moscow apartment.
   Smukler was one of 250 lawyers _ including Soviet delegates _
who attended a two-day meeting held Monday and Tuesday in Moscow.
   Soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legal
system, yet the emigration problem is not being solved, said Irwin
Cotler, a lawyer from Montreal. ``There is a legal revolution going
on,'' Cotler said, ``but the problem is that the revolution does
not embrace the right of emigration.''
   He proposed sustained emigration of at least 25,000 Jews a year,
a policy of allowing complete reunification of families, and
protection of religious and cultural rights.
   New Soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a close
relative, something that international law lists only as a possible
additional reason to allow emigration, he said.
   Emigration of Soviet Jews reached a peak of more than 51,000 in
1979. It dropped to about 1,000 a year in 1984-86 before rising to
more than 8,000 last year. About 4,500 Jews were allowed to
emigrate between January and May 1988.
   Two of the main reasons for Soviet refusal to allow emigration
are alleged access to state secrets and refusal of relatives to
renounce financial claims against those who wish to emigrate.
   The international lawyers said one Soviet speaker, a lawyer from
the Institute of State and Law they could identify only as
Katishkin, said his institute was studying reforms that could ease
those restrictions.
   But the lawyers reported that Soviet officials also said they
did not want to allow Soviet citizens to emigrate to countries with
fewer social services, or to allow mentally ill people or drug
addicts to emigrate.
   Michael Freeman, a law professor at London University, said the
Soviet delegates to the conference ``may as well have been robots
or automatons for all their capacity for independent thought.''
   The lawyers said the Soviet speaker proposed that restrictions
on emigration for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to
five years, and that financial claims against would-be emigres be
restricted.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday that Rudolf
Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet visa office, told the conference that
Soviet emigration laws are based on international law and that the
number of people being allowed to emigrate has been increasing.
   He said 40,000 people emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987
and 29,000 people left during the first five months of 1988. Those
who left this year are mostly Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans,
he said.
   The lawyers said about 20 Israeli lawyers attended the
conference but that another 10 were refused visas.
   A British lawyer, Jonathan Arkush, said eight other lawyers at
first were denied visas and the International Bar Association
canceled the conference until Soviet officials reversed their
decision.
   He said British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe intervened
to gain visas for him and several other British lawyers.

<TEXT>
   Officials canceled final exams and
graduation for the senior class at Fairview High School, saying
they feared a group of students had planned to commit suicide or
other violence during ceremonies.
   ``It's more than just pranks,'' Frank Kroto, Fairview School
District solicitor, said Wednesday. ``It's more than the typical
end of the year dissatisfaction with authority.''
   Kroto also said several school administrators received personal
threats and were being protected by police. He did not give
details, but state police said troopers were patrolling near some
administrators' homes, as if they asked for patrols while on
vacation.
   Officials said they have evidence of a suicide pact among
friends of a senior who fatally shot himself at home with a
.44-caliber Magnum handgun at Christmastime in the presence of
another student. Officials said another, similar handgun was stolen
from the dead student's home and has not been recovered.
   Police heard some students were planning to make graduation ``a
memorable graduation, one that they would never forget,'' The Erie
Daily Times reported Wednesday.
   School Board President Barbara Junker, who announced the
cancellation at a tense board meeting Tuesday night, said several
students she did not identify ``threatened to cause serious
disruption at this year's graduation.''
   Mrs. Junker said officials could not guarantee the safety of
students and relatives at baccalaureate ceremonies Thursday and at
graduation Sunday for 150 seniors.
   Teachers will issue final grades on the basis of students'
school work; the board did not decide how students will receive
diplomas.
   ``The problem is if one person on this stage shoots himself or
someone else, the board is responsible,'' Kroto said at the
meeting, adding that officials have ``evidence there is a
possibility this could happen.''
   Kroto said many parents agreed with the board's action, but one
mother, who was not identified by the newspaper, said officials
were acting on ``a bunch of rumors, none of them based on any
evidence.''
   Senior Neal Loenslein said he's talked to other students, has
found no students with weapons and doesn't believe in the existence
of a suicide pact.
   ``Everyone I've talked to doesn't know anything about guns or
anything,'' he said. ``It's all coming from the administration.''
   The board, he said, ``built all this out of nothing.''
   State police Cpl. James Scheig in nearby Girard said law
enforcement authorities are not investigating alleged threats of
violence or the possibility of suicides.
   ``No official complaints have been made to us whatsoever,''
Scheig said. ``We don't investigate rumors. They know that.''
   He said, however, troopers are patrolling near certain
administrators' homes. ``We are making passes through their areas
to make our presence known. No big deal,'' Scheig said.
   Kroto said he could not explain what might be driving the
students to contemplate killing themselves.
   One female student told police the four or five students
involved were from affluent families in this Lake Erie suburb of
about 7,500 people, according to the newspaper, which did not
identify her.
   ``They're not the leather-jacket types. They have a reputation
as partiers. They're known by everybody,'' the newspaper quoted her
as saying.
   Although psychologists and psychiatrists have been working with
students and teachers since the senior committed suicide, Mrs.
Junker said there was still ``a certain segment that the counselors
warn could be potentially threatening to either themselves and
possibly others.''
   Senior Kim Zeigler said a psychiatrist told students after the
suicide that there should be a memorial to the victim in the 1988
yearbook. But, she said, officials would not allow it.
   ``The administration made everyone so mad that there's
definitely some kind of danger,'' she said. ``They (the
administration) made it like a jail in there ... like a fortress.''

   Divers and a team of specially
trained dogs joined the search through partially flooded mine
shafts Wednesday for three men still missing after a gas explosion
ripped through a mine.
   Three thousand people packed the local community center to pay
respects to the victims in an emotional ceremony that united
Christians and Moslems in their grief. Thirteen Turks were among at
least 48 miners killed. Rescue teams found the body of the latest
victim late Wednesday, officials said.
   The miners died after the powerful methane gas explosion tore
through the Stolzenbach mine on June 1 in Borken, 70 miles
northeast of Frankfurt.
   Six of the 57 men trapped in the mine were rescued after
spending 65 hours buried 500 feet underground.
   The ZDF television network reported that divers with underwater
breathing apparatus were enlisted to search because parts of the
mine were under water
   Peter-Carl Ruehland, a spokesman for mine owner Preussen
Elektra, said the divers went into action early Wednesday but so
far had turned up no trace of the missing men.
   Officials said high levels of deadly carbon monoxide measured
earlier in the mine shafts made it unlikely that the three missing
men were alive.
   A rotating team of six to eight dogs joined the mine search as
levels of carbon monoxide receded, Preussen Elektra board member
Heinz Cramer said. He said the dogs were specially trained for use
in mines and were scouring areas not filled by water.
   A local prosecutor has opened a probe into the explosion,
reportedly to see whether an ``open flame'' may have touched off
the methane gas. ZDF reported Tuesday that ``reliable sources have
said that smoking took place in the mine.''
   The 3,000 Germans and Turks gathered in a local community center
at midday for a joint Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and Moslem memorial
service.
   ``I came to mourn my uncle,'' said Tolay Guersel, 24, who
traveled from his home in Munich to attend the service. He carried
a picture of his uncle, Ali Akser Akarsu, one of the Turks who lost
his life in the mine.
   Officials from the Turkish Embassy and Turkey's Labor Minister
Imren Aykut also attended the ceremony.
   Many at the service wept quietly as a Lutheran pastor and a
Roman Catholic priest read off the names of all 47 miners confirmed
dead as of Wednesday morning, along with the names of the missing.
   ``The disaster has deeply shocked the people and left them
bewildered and speechless,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop Johannes
Kapp, of nearby Fulda.
   An orchestra of miners, wearing traditional hats with bright
plumes, played solemn music at the service, while other miners in
traditional dress sang in a choir.
   Many businesses in Borken closed so that shop owners and
employees could attend the ceremony.

He made the comment Wednesday at a news conference with Jewish
refuseniks at a Moscow apartment.
   Smukler was one of 250 lawyers _ including Soviet delegates _
who attended a two-day meeting held Monday and Tuesday in Moscow.
   Soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legal
system, yet the emigration problem is not being solved, said Irwin
Cotler, a lawyer from Montreal. ``There is a legal revolution going
on,'' Cotler said, ``but the problem is that the revolution does
not embrace the right of emigration.''
   He proposed sustained emigration of at least 25,000 Jews a year,
a policy of allowing complete reunification of families, and
protection of religious and cultural rights.
   New Soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a close
relative, something that international law lists only as a possible
additional reason to allow emigration, he said.
   Emigration of Soviet Jews reached a peak of more than 51,000 in
1979. It dropped to about 1,000 a year in 1984-86 before rising to
more than 8,000 last year. About 4,500 Jews were allowed to
emigrate between January and May 1988.
   Two of the main reasons for Soviet refusal to allow emigration
are alleged access to state secrets and refusal of relatives to
renounce financial claims against those who wish to emigrate.
   The international lawyers said one Soviet speaker, a lawyer from
the Institute of State and Law they could identify only as
Katishkin, said his institute was studying reforms that could ease
those restrictions.
   But the lawyers reported that Soviet officials also said they
did not want to allow Soviet citizens to emigrate to countries with
fewer social services, or to allow mentally ill people or drug
addicts to emigrate.
   Michael Freeman, a law professor at London University, said the
Soviet delegates to the conference ``may as well have been robots
or automatons for all their capacity for independent thought.''
   The lawyers said the Soviet speaker proposed that restrictions
on emigration for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to
five years, and that financial claims against would-be emigres be
restricted.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday that Rudolf
Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet visa office, told the conference that
Soviet emigration laws are based on international law and that the
number of people being allowed to emigrate has been increasing.
   He said 40,000 people emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1987
and 29,000 people left during the first five months of 1988. Those
who left this year are mostly Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans,
he said.
   The lawyers said about 20 Israeli lawyers attended the
conference but that another 10 were refused visas.
   A British lawyer, Jonathan Arkush, said eight other lawyers at
first were denied visas and the International Bar Association
canceled the conference until Soviet officials reversed their
decision.
   He said British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe intervened
to gain visas for him and several other British lawyers.

   Thousands of radicals hurling
firebombs and rocks battled riot police Wednesday as the government
began deploying 60,000 police to stop students from marching to the
border with North Korea.
   Students held rallies at many schools nationwide in support of
the planned march Friday to demand South Korea's reunification with
the north. Violent clashes occurred at more than 10 campuses, where
students dashed out to hurl firebombs and rocks at riot police who
responded with volleys of tear gas.
   It was not known immediately how many people were injured or
arrested.
   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the partition of our land!''
students shouted during the clashes. Radicals have demanded the
withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact, contending the U.S. presence hinders
reunification of the divided peninsula.
   The radicals represent a small, but powerful minority on college
campuses, with the most extreme, pro-leftist elements increasingly
taking control of the protest movement as its support has declined.
   Radical student leaders have called for up to 40,000 students to
rally at Seoul's Yonsei University on Thursday for an overnight
vigil before the 30-mile march to the North Korean border.
   Police said the university would be completely sealed off
Thursday to block the planned rally, but student leaders threatened
to stage violent protests in downtown Seoul if the vigil is blocked.
   Tens of thousands of riot police took positions Wednesday around
campuses and other key locations across the country to stop
students from rallying in support of the march.
   Some radicals vowed to commit suicide. Three students have
killed themselves in recent anti-government protests.
   Police Wednesday intercepted students as they marched in protest
off university campuses in the southern city of Kwangju and the
southeast city of Taegu.
   In the southern port city of Pusan, 5,000 students from 12
schools held a common rally at a university before leaving for
Seoul, although thousands of police guarded bus terminals and
railway stations to block their way.
   On campuses in other provincial cities, students occupied school
buildings after faculty members refused their demands to provide
transport.
   In an interview with The Hankook Ilbo, an independent Seoul
newspaper, President Roh Tae-woo said he supports exchanges and
debate between South Korean and North Korean students.
   But the president urged students to leave contact with the north
to official channels and cautioned against leftist or revolutionary
movements trying to topple South Korea's liberal democracy.
   Opposition party leaders also appealed to students to postpone
their plans for the march, saying it lacked national support.
   Reunification has been a deeply emotional issue among Koreans
since the peninsula was divided after World War II into communist
North Korea and pro-Western South Korea.
   Most South Koreans support unification of the two Koreas, but
many fear the north is determined to invade the south, as it did in
1950.
   North Korea, which welcomed the proposed student talks, has
selected a 13-member student delegation to attend the planned
meeting Friday at the border village of Panmunjom, inside the
Demilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas.

<TEXT>
   Evangelist Billy Graham, who arrived in Moscow on
Wednesday along with a high-ranking Vatican delegation, said he was
hopeful of new religious freedom in the Soviet Union.
   The religious leaders are here for celebrations marking the
1,000th anniversary of Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union.
   Graham, 69, caused controversy when he suggested during a 1982
visit that there was more religious liberty in this officially
atheist nation than Americans had been led to believe. The Baptist
minister said Wednesday he saw hopeful signs under Mikhail
Gorbachev, who became Soviet leader in March 1985.
   ``We have heard with great interest that there is an official
commitment by General Secretary Gorbachev and other leaders of your
government to expand the religious rights and opportunities of
believers and churches,'' Graham said upon arrival at Moscow's
Sheremetyevo Airport.
   Graham said he wanted to learn how ``glasnost,'' Gorbachev's
policy of openness on selected issues, and ``perestroika,'' his
program for restructuring the economy, had affected religious
believers.
   He and 10 Roman Catholic cardinals, part of the largest Vatican
delegation ever in the Soviet Union, were greeted by Metropolitan
Filaret, a senior official of the Russian church.
   The leader of the Vatican delegation, Cardinal Agostino
Casaroli, was carrying the first letter from Pope John Paul II to
Gorbachev.
   Casaroli told reporters he does not know whether he will meet
with Gorbachev, but Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said such a
session might occur Monday during a Kremlin ceremony marking the
anniversary.
   Casaroli, the Vatican's secretary of state, declined to disclose
the contents of the papal letter.
   He called perestroika ``a good idea.''
   ``Everything which assures a greater participation of the people
and greater participation of the church in the society is
positive,'' Casaroli told reporters.
   Before leaving Rome, Casaroli expressed ``great satisfaction''
in the progress made so far in Vatican-Soviet relations, but said
they had not yet reached the stage where a papal visit would be
possible.
   The Polish-born pope has frequently expressed his desire to
visit his flock in the Soviet Union, but only if he would be free
to travel to visit Catholics throughout the country, including the
Ukraine and Lithuania.
   Among the other Catholic dignitaries traveling with Casaroli are
Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, and Cardinal Roger Etchegaray,
president of the Vatican's Justice and Peace Commission.
   The festivities begun this week come at a time when Communist
authorities are rewriting laws regulating religion to allow
believers more latitude in expressing their faith.
   O'Connor, on his first visit to the Soviet Union, said the
Vatican delegation hopes its visit ``will help advance the cause of
spiritual union between East and West, between Orthodoxy and the
Roman Catholic Church.''

   Convicted child killer Arthur Gary Bishop
has met with his parents and a Mormon chaplain as he prepared for
his execution early Friday, a corrections official said.
   Barring unexpected legal intervention, Bishop will die by lethal
injection shortly after 12:01 a.m. Friday to become the 99th inmate
executed in the United States since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling ended a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment.
   Bishop, 36, has said he hopes his death will bring peace to the
parents of the five boys, ages 4 to 13, he sexually molested and
killed during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   ``He seems to be preparing himself for what will take place, as
well as anyone can,'' Corrections Department spokesman Juan
Benavidez said Wednesday.
   Benavidez said Bishop had indicated he will fast during the
hours prior to the execution.
   Bishop will be strapped to the gurney and a solution of sodium
penathol, Pavulon and potassium chloride will be injected into his
veins. The drugs first will put Bishop to sleep, then paralyze his
lungs and stop his heart.
   Utah law allows the condemned to choose between lethal injection
or firing squad.
   Bishop, an Eagle Scout and former Mormon missionary who was
excommunicated prior to his arrest, initially appealed his death
sentence. But after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his appeal Feb.
3, Bishop filed a motion to fire his attorneys and replace them
with counsel willing to abandon further appeals.
   Following a 3rd District Court competency hearing, the high
court on May 2 ruled in Bishop's favor.
   The last execution in Utah was that of Pierre Dale Selby in
August 1987. Selby was executed after 13 years of appeal for the
torture-murders of three people during a 1974 robbery. Selby's
execution was the first in Utah since that of Gary Gilmore in 1977.

   An adviser to a black teen-ager who claims she
was abducted and raped by six white men dared the state attorney
general to ``show the nation the moral beast you are'' and arrest
the girl's mother, who sought sanctuary in a church after refusing
to testify about the case.
   Glenda Brawley spent Wednesday morning ``resting and praying''
in Ebenezer Baptist Church in the New York City borough of Queens,
said the Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to the family.
   Mrs. Brawley, 33, was sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail for
defying a grand jury subpoena to testify about the alleged attack
on her daughter, 16-year-old Tawana.
   Her advisers have accused local and state authorities of a
racially motivated cover-up and claimed the Brawleys cannot get
justice from the courts.
   Sharpton appeared outside the church and challenged Attorney
General Robert Abrams, who had given Mrs. Brawley until Wednesday
to appear before the grand jury.
   ``There's nothing legally stopping you from coming in here. So
show the nation the moral beast you are and come through these
doors and arrest her,'' Sharpton said.
   ``She'd rather be arrested in the house of God than to be
sitting in front of a stacked grand jury to participate in the
hanging of her daughter,'' he said, adding, ```But even you, Mr.
Abrams, your arms are too short to box with God.''
   However, Mrs. Brawley's attorneys backed off from earlier claims
that police could not legally arrest Mrs. Brawley in the church,
which dominates an industrial neighborhood.
   Andrew Schnier of the New York State Bar Association's criminal
justice section said there was no state or common law that would
preclude authorities from executing an arrest warrant in a
religious institution.
   A spokesman for Abrams, who was appointed by Gov. Mario Cuomo to
handle the case, said he was prepared to wait before arresting Mrs.
Brawley.
   ``Whether it's today, tomorrow _ Glenda Brawley is no particular
threat to the public safety or public order,'' said spokesman Tim
Gilles, who was with Abrams in Poughkeepsie, 85 miles north of New
York, where the grand jury was continuing its investigation.
   Miss Brawley was found lying dazed in a road about 10 miles from
her Poughkeepsie home after having been missing for four days last
November. She was wrapped in a plastic bag, her hair shorn, with
animal excrement smeared on her and racial epithets scrawled on her
body.
   Miss Brawley initially told authorities she was abducted and
raped by six white men, but she and her family have refused to
cooperate with the grand jury.
   Sharpton and the family's lawyers _ C. Vernon Mason and Alton
Maddox Jr. _ once again called for Abrams to step aside and for the
governor to appoint a special prosecutor. Sharpton also hinted that
Miss Brawley may cooperate with a new ``impartial prosecutor.''
   Speaking through the media to Abrams, Sharpton said:
   ``If you do not step aside, the minute you close your grand jury
we will only go to the governor and say, `Governor, give us a
prosecutor because we have a new witness and new evidence _ her
name is Tawana Brawley.'''
   The grand jury would likely wind up its probe in ``a month or
so'' if the Brawleys do not cooperate, Gilles said.
   ``We're prepared to stay here as long as it takes,'' Mason said
outside the church. Mrs. Brawley was invited to seek ``religious
asylum and sanctuary'' at the church by its pastor, Rev. Timothy
Mitchell, he added.
   Mrs. Brawley did not appear outside. Black reporters from a
radio station were allowed inside but said they did not see Mrs.
Brawley. All other reporters were barred by a well-dressed man
guarding the front door. No city police were at the church.

<HEAD>Record Number of Defense Contractors Denied Right To Bid in Early
1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department stripped a record 284
contractors of their right to bid for military work because of
wrongdoing during the first half of fiscal 1988, according to a
Pentagon report released Wednesday.
   In addition, the bidding rights of another 173 contractors were
suspended temporarily, and 2,373 civilian and military indictments
were obtained alleging contracting improprieties.
   The new figures are contained in a semi-annual report to
Congress by the Pentagon's inspector general. Previously, the
record for debarring defense contractors of bidding rights during a
six-month period was the 275 reported for the last half of fiscal
1987.
   During all of fiscal 1987, the Defense Department debarred 505
individuals and companies of their right to bid on contracts _ an
annual record.
   The latest report, which covers the period from Oct. 1, 1987, to
March 31, also found that Pentagon and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
auditors saved the government an estimated $3.1 billion during the
six-month period by challenging questionable awards or future
contracting plans.
   To produce those savings, the auditors issued more than 26,000
reports and questioned more than $57.6 billion in contract costs,
the report said.
   Another $2.7 billion was reported saved during the period
through follow-up audits aimed at completing cases that originally
led to management disputes over the auditor's recommendations.
   Among some of the more significant investigative actions cited
during the period were the racketeering and bribery convictions of
defense employees at the clothing directorate of a Philadelphia
procurement center; a cost-mischarging case settled by Motorola
Inc. for $9.9 million; a defective pricing and illegal gratuities
case against the Eaton Corp. that produced $9.5 million in
restitution; and a huge defective pricing case settled with Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc. for more than $85 million.
   The inspector general by law maintains a staff of auditors and
investigators who operate independently, outside the control of top
Pentagon executives. The latest report is dated May 30 but was not
released until Wednesday.
   In a foreword to the report, Inspector General June Gibbs Brown
wrote the figures demonstrated ``our commitment to vigorous,
innovative efforts to achieve the widest possible cooperation in
fighting the misuse of dollars appropriated for the defense of our
country.''
   On the investigative side, the inspector general said there were
294 indictments during the period obtained by the Justice
Department on the Pentagon's behalf, plus another 143 indictments
at the local, state or foreign level and 1,936 recommendations for
courts-martial.
   During the six months, the Justice Department obtained 244
convictions; local, state and foreign authorities 188 convictions
and the military commands another 2,448 through courts-martial.
   The inspector general said the federal government managed to
recover $245.3 million during the first half of the year thanks to
completed investigations _ another record _ plus another $35.9
million in fines, penalties and restitutions and $23.7 million in
civil settlements and judgments.
   The Pentagon's Fraud Hotline, meantime, fielded 5,449 reports
during the period, up slightly compared with the previous six-month
period. Of the total received, 1,865 were judged to be
``substantive complaints'' and were referred for investigation or
other action, the report said.

<HEAD>S&L Deposits Still Rising Despite Publicity From Bailouts,
Closings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans continued to entrust their money to
savings institutions in April, despite increasing publicity about
S&L bailouts and closings, the government said Wednesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net deposits at the 3,113
federally insured thrift institutions increased by $1.2 billion to
$962.4 billion in April, the seventh consecutive monthly increase.
   ``The steady deposit gains continue to indicate consumer
confidence in thrifts as a secure haven for funds,'' the bank board
said in a statement.
   Deposit growth slowed in April when compared with the $4.3
billion jump in March, but bank board economist James Barth said
deposit receipts normally decline in April as people pay their
federal income taxes. He said the slowdown this year was milder
than usual.
   Net deposits during the first four months of this year totaled
$16.3 billion. That was a reversal of the trend a year ago, when
there were net withdrawals of $14.3 billion in the same period.
   The growth occurred as the bank board stepped up the pace of S&L
closings. So far this year, 37 institutions have been closed or,
with government assistance, merged into other S&Ls.
   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress,
warned last month that in several years there may not be enough
money coming into the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to
resolve the cases of the estimated 500 insolvent institutions.
   However, Congress has pledged the full faith and credit of the
United States in backing the accounts should FSLIC run dry.
   Deposits had drained steadily from S&Ls during much of 1987 in
what analysts called a ``slow-motion run.'' But after the October
market crash, many investors sought the safety of federally insured
accounts and pulled their money out of stocks.
   The bank board report, a summary of S&L balance sheets,
highlighted a more worrisome trend: the continued decline of thrift
institutions' capital.
   Capital represents the money that would be left over for an
institution's owners should all its assets be sold and liabilities
paid off. The more capital an institution has, the less danger
there is that it will become insolvent.
   The industry's capital declined by $390 million in April,
following a $2.7 billion decline in March. However, $1.2 billion of
the March drop was attributed to losses at a single institution,
Sunbelt Savings Association in Dallas.
   In the first four months of 1988, capital declined by $3.85
billion, compared with a gain of $1.37 billion in the comparable
period of 1987.
   The report also said the thrift industry increased its mortgage
lending in April to $18.6 billion, up $200 million from March but
24 percent below a year ago.
   Analysts expect a decline in mortgage lending as rising interest
rates slow home buying and building this summer.

   Six major news organizations on Wednesday
asked the judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case to allow
reporters to attend a closed pre-trial hearing scheduled to be held
on Monday in U.S. District Court here.
   The news organizations, which include the ABC and CBS television
networks and The New York Times, asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell to open the hearing where government officials are
scheduled to testify about how witnesses were briefed before they
were questioned by the Iran-Contra grand jury.
   Gesell ordered the hearing to determine whether or not
government officials who appeared before the grand jury had been
exposed to the immunized congressional testimony of Oliver North
and two co-defendants when they were prepared by government lawyers
for the grand jury sessions.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
arms dealer Albert Hakim have moved to dismiss the 23-count
indictment on the ground that the prosecution and the grand jury
made impermissible use of the congressional testimony the
defendants gave last year under limited grants of immunity from
prosecution.
   In explaining why he scheduled the closed hearing, Gesell said
in a brief June 2 order that ``it is expected the testimony may to
some extent involve classified materials and to some degree relate
to matters of attorney-client privilege.''
   Gesell also said that he would promptly release a transcript of
the hearing after deleting any classified or privileged material.
   In seeking to open the hearing, the news organizations argued
that Gesell had not met Supreme Court requirements for closing the
hearing. ``The closure of a portion of a criminal trial must always
be done with the utmost caution and deliberation,'' said a joint
brief filed by six news organizations, which also included The Wall
Street Journal, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
   ``The need for such caution is especially evident in this case
since it involves issues of such national interest and
importance,'' the brief said.
   The news organizations contended that ``the mere fact that
certain material may be classified is not in itself sufficient to
warrant automatic closure of an entire hearing.''
   ``At most, it would justify exclusion of the press and the
public from that portion of the hearing at which classified
information was discussed,'' the brief said. It said that Gesell's
order ``does not explain why partial closure is not sufficient'' to
protect secret information.

<HEAD>Soviets Call For Mutual Nuclear Test Ban, Cutting 1 Million Troops
In Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Wednesday invited the United States to join the
Soviet Union in banning all nuclear tests as part of a sweeping new
disarmament proposal.
   Speaking to the U.N. special session on disarmament,
Shevardnadze said the goal was ``a step-by-step elimination of
nuclear weapons by the year 2000.''
   He also called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Warsaw Pact to each reduce their forces by 500,000 troops.
   For the first time, Shevardnadze declared that the Soviet Union
would announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval
ships on foreign port calls if the United States and Western allies
do the same.
   The United States has consistently refused to confirm or deny
whether its ships are nuclear-powered or carry nuclear weapons.
   Hailing the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap medium- and
shorter-range missiles as a turning point in the history of arms
control, Shevardnadze invited U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar and other officials to witness the destruction of one of
the first batches of missiles.
   In a news conference later, Soviet arms negotiator Anatoly
Krapov said the destruction of the missles would begin soon after
July 1.
   Vernon A. Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called
Shevardnadze's 45-minute address ``extremely interesting.
   ``It broke a lot of new ground and it is deserving of study,''
Walters said.
   In 1985, the Soviet Union announced a unilateral nuclear test
moratorium that began on Aug. 6, the anniversary of the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima. The United States continued testing, and the
Soviets ended their moratorium one and a half years later.
   ``Our invariable position on a nuclear testing moratorium is
still valid,'' Shevardnadze said. ``On the basis of reciprocity
with the United States, we are ready to reintroduce and to observe
it, this time not for a year and a half, but for all times.''
   He said the Moscow summit between Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Reagan ``has shown that despite their
profound differences, the Soviet Union and (the) United States can
cooperate.''
   On conventional disarmament, the area in which NATO says the
Soviets hold a clear advantage in Europe, Shevardnadze proposed an
exchange of all official data on troop strength, followed by
on-site inspections to verify the information.
   He said the second phase in the negotiations would deal with
cutbacks in the armed forces of each side by approximately 500,000
men, and the third would entail further reductions that would give
NATO and the Warsaw Pact ``a defensive character and their
offensive nucleus would be dismantled.''
   The only sour note in an otherwise optimistic speech was
Shevardnadze's claim that the accords for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan are being violated.
   In a news conference held later, the Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Vladimir Petrovsky, said Pakistan was the target of the
criticism.
   Shevardnadze told the delegates: ``When one party observes its
obligations under the Geneva agreements while the other party is
violating them, this naturally causes us to have doubts about our
partner and to refuse to trust him.''
   The United Nations helped negotiate a pact, signed in Geneva,
which calls for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Red Army troops
from Afghanistan within a year, and the repatriation of millions of
Afghan refugees.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan signed the accords, with the Soviet
Union and the United States signing as guarantors.
   The Soviet foreign minister also called for:
   _A global ban on chemical weapons.
   _Establishment of an International Monitoring and Verification
Agency under the United Nations. It would coordinate and monitor
arms reduction agreements, verify compliance and monitor the
military situation in conflict areas.
   _Preventing the introduction of weapons into outer space and
establishment of an international space monitoring agency.
   _Restrictions on sales and supplies of conventional arms.
   _Limits on development of more destructive conventional arms and
new technologies, such as laser beams, genetic and electromagnetic
systems.
   _Including naval forces in disarmament negotiations. He rejected
the idea that naval forces are off-limits to arms control talks.
   _Creation of U.N. naval forces of permanent Security Council
members and proposed a joint trial in which the member fleets would
practice maintaining freedom of navigation by U.N. forces.
   The United States and many Western countries, which have naval
forces in the Middle East, have opposed a U.N. force as unworkable.

   An incident in Moscow that led to a full-page
newspaper advertisement for Time magazine resulted from an aide's
request that President Reagan get Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's autograph for a friend, the White House disclosed
Wednesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Kenneth M.
Duberstein, deputy White House chief of staff, asked Reagan to get
Gorbachev to sign the Jan. 4, 1988 issue of the magazine that had
the Soviet leader's picture on the cover as ``Man of the Year.''
   He said Reagan made the request just after the formal farewell
ceremony at the conclusion of the U.S.-Soviet summit last week, and
Gorbachev complied.
   Duberstein, asked about the incident as he left a White House
luncheon Wednesday, said he made the request on behalf of ``an old
friend in New York.'' The deputy chief of staff did not return a
reporter's telephone call seeking more details.
   The autograph incident was first reported by Tass, the Soviet
news agency, which did not mention that Reagan asked for the
autograph at anybody's request. Time reproduced a New York Times
account of the Tass version in a full-page ad in Wednesday's
editions of the Times, under the headline, ``What WAS signed in
Moscow last week.''

Youths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Wednesday
proposed changing the way the government spends some $750 million a
year on training hard-core disadvantaged youths for jobs.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said the administration plans to
send a bill to Congress in the next two weeks that would allow
local communities to expand the current summer-only program to a
year-round effort.
   It also would change the formula used for allocating the funds
in order to shift more of them to inner cities where youth
unemployment is highest, particularly among black teen-agers.
   The current formula established by Congress is based on local
unemployment rates generally. The new formula would be based on
Census Bureau data on the percentage of disadvantaged youths in a
community's population.
   ``We have been concerned for some time on how to reach the most
disadvantaged youths,'' Mrs. McLaughlin told the employment
subcommittee of the Senate Labor Committee. ``Cyclical changes in
unemployment rates may cause large funding swings under the current
formula that are unrelated to the youth poverty situation in a
local area.''
   The program under Title II-B of the Job Training Partnership Act
now provides about $900 each for six-week job-training programs in
the summer for about 800,000 youths ages 14 to 21 each year.
   Robert Jones, assistant labor secretary for job training, said
the changes would allow communities to spend up to $2,000 or $3,000
on each youth in the program.
   ``Technically, we would serve a few less,'' he said, ``but we
would serve them much more effectively. You can't address the youth
unemployment issue just in terms of numbers; you have to do it
qualitatively.''
   Unemployment among teen-agers is about three times the overall
civilian jobless rate of 5.6 percent. Although joblessness among
black teen-agers has declined more than 15 percentage points since
the early 1980s, it is still more than six times the overall rate.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds dropped for the
second consecutive month in May, falling 0.9 percent to $655
million, the government said Wednesday.
   The Treasury Department said April sales were $6 million lower
than in April and $51 million lower than in March. However, prior
to the two drops, sales had increased eight months in a row. Also,
May sales were 8.8 percent higher than sales a year ago.
   With the inclusion of interest earnings, the value of
outstanding bonds rose $540 million to $105.65 billion in May, 9.9
percent higher than a year ago.
   Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer
earn market-based interest rates. The current rate, in effect until
Nov. 1, is 6.90 percent, down from 7.17 percent in the six months
that ended May 1.
   The Treasury Department began a new program a month ago to sell
bonds by telephone. Investors can use a credit card to purchase
bonds 24 hours a day by calling 1-800-US-BONDS.

   East Germany expressed readiness Wednesday to aid
Jews who survived the Nazi Holocaust.
   The official news agency ADN quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman
Wolfgang Meyer as saying the Communist government ``is now prepared
to give humanitarian aid and assistance to Jewish victims in other
countries.''
   That appears to reverse previous policy. East Germany, formed in
1949, has said it bore no legal or moral responsibility for the
actions of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   ADN said the decision came after contacts with Jewish leaders in
and outside the country, and ``the kind and amount of help are
still under discussion.''
   Heinz Galinski, chairman of the German Jewish Council, said
Monday the East German government was prepared to pay up to $100
million to Jewish victims.
   Galinski, who lives in West Berlin, said the money would be
offered as ``aid for Holocaust survivors who are in need of
material assistance,'' not as repayment to German Jews for their
losses under Nazi rule.
   He said the agreement was reached after a meeting with Erich
Hoenecker, the East Germany leader.
   The news agency report did not mention a money figure, but said
the agreement to assist survivors was concluded in meetings with
Jewish leaders, including Galinski.
   More than 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
   In 1952, the Luxembourg Agreement covering reparations was
signed by the World Jewish Congress and West Germany but not by
East Germany.
   West Germany has paid more than 80 billion marks _ $48 billion
at the current exchange rate _ to Holocaust survivors around the
world.

<HEAD>Reagan Introduces Bill To Permanently Ban Federal Funds for
Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan sent Congress legislation on
Wednesday to make permanent the ban on use of federal funds for
abortions unless the life of the mother is endangered, the White
House said.
   Currently, the anti-abortion provision is included annually in
the appropriation act for the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   In his letter to Congress, Reagan said, ``This important
legislation carries out my commitment to protect the rights of
unborn children by prohibiting federal dollars from being used to
fund abortion unless a mother's life would be physically endangered
by carrying the fetus to term.''
   Reagan said the bill would enact the so-called Hyde Amendment,
named for Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., on a permanent basis.
   ``Enacting this prohibition on the funding of abortion in
general legislation will exend its application to all agencies and
to all federal funds,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan's domestic policy adviser, Gary Bauer, said the bill was
to fulfill a pledge Reagan made in his last State of the Union
address to try to make the amendment permanent.
   But Kate Michelman, the executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, called it a ``a last ditch effort''
on the part of the administration.
   ``I don't believe Congress is prepared to go that far to
institutionalize this forever,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz tried
to clear some obstacles Wednesday to a new agreement on U.S. bases
in Spain, which is the newest NATO member and is evicting 72 U.S.
jet fighters.
   Shultz sought to speed negotiations on American use of the naval
base at Rota, in southwestern Spain, and two joint air facilities
in time for signing before the summer holiday of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez and his government.
   Rota is an important support post for the U.S. 6th Fleet, which
patrols the Mediterranean.
   Before Shultz met with Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez, however, the Spanish official was quoted as saying the
secretary's 72-hour visit would not accelerate the accord.
   ``During the meeting we will clarify certain points, but nothing
else,'' he said state-run television.
   After their talk, Shultz said: ``These discussions are good, and
it was a worthwhile investment of an hour.'' Fernandez said the
meeting was ``very positive and constuctive (but) there's still
work to be done.''
   Shultz also briefed Prime Minister Gonzalez on Wednesday about
the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow and his unsuccessful
effort for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``The bulk of the discussion was devoted to the bases agreement,
(with) the secretary expressing our thought (that) this ought to be
moved to completion,'' a senior U.S. official said.
   The official, who spoke with journalists on condition his name
not be used, would not predict when the new defense agreement would
be finished. ``Any time you are in one of these negotiations you
don't have an agreement until you have an agreement,'' he said.
   Shultz also paid a courtesy call on King Juan Carlos.
   The senior U.S. official was asked about a report that Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said in New York he had not
discussed the specifics of the U.S. peace plan with Shultz in the
Middle East.
   ``I really don't know what he's talking about. They talked about
the Middle East at length,'' the official said.
   When questioned about a report that President Hafez Assad of
Syria asked Shultz to open contacts with Iran, the official said it
never happened.
   Spain has ordered F-16 fighter jets of the 401st Tactical
Fighter Wing to leave Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid, forcing the
unit's relocation at a projected cost of $500 million.
   On June 4, the Italian government agreed to accept the 72 jets
subject to parliamentary approval. They are to leave Spain within
three years after the new bases agreement is signed.
   Moving the fighter wing will cost Washington an estimated $150
million, the U.S. share of contributions to the infrastructure fund
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The fund will finance
the move unless NATO defense ministers decide on an another
approach.
   The United States also has agreed to pay an estimated $12
million of the total cost of recreational facilities at the new
F-16 base in Italy.
   Lord Carrington of Britain, the NATO secretary-general, said:
``I think the outcome is very satisfactory. If the alliance as a
whole had not decided to ask Italy and decided to pay for the
transfer, this would have sent a wholly wrong signal to the United
States ... in connection with European interest in the defense of
the southern flank.''
   Carrington addressed a news conference the day before the spring
meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the first to be held in
Spain since it became the 16th member of NATO in May 1982.
   Several administrative and other obstacles hold up completion of
a new eight-year defense accord between the United States and Spain
announced Jan. 15, when the United States agreed to move the F-16s.
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gen. Francisco Franco, the
Spanish dictator, signed the first agreement in 1953. Franco died
in 1975.
   The Reagan administration is encouraged by the fact that the
next extension will be for eight years, rather than the usual five,
and that no U.S. aid to Spain will be tied to it.
   Gonzalez saw his Socialist Party's second electoral victory two
years ago as a mandate to evict the U.S. planes from Torrejon, a
joint-use base just outside Madrid.
   In a referendum Gonzalez called in March 1986, Spaniards
approved retaining NATO membership but on condition the U.S.
military presence be reduced, Spain be free of nuclear weapons and
its armed forces stay outside the integrated NATO command.
   Spaniards tend to view U.S. military bases as a symbol of
American support for Franco.
   Negotiations began two years ago when Spain indicated it would
seek a reduction in U.S. military forces in keeping with the
referendum results.

<TEXT>
   Legislation approved by the House on Wednesday
would require telephones to be compatible with hearing aids.
   The measure was passed 391-15. A similar bill is pending in the
Senate.
   The bill would require compatibility for all phones made in or
imported into the United States one year after enactment of the
measure. Mobile, cellular and secure phones would be exempt.
Cordless phones would be exempt for three years after enactment.
   ``We simply cannot confine the hearing impaired to a world of
silence,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
House Commerce and Energy subcommittee on telecommunications.
   More than half of the estimated 4 million hearing-aid users in
the United States use a hearing aid equipped with a ``telecoil,''
which cuts the feedback a user would otherwise hear when talking on
the telephone.
   Some hearing aid-wearers pick up high-pitched squeals when they
use some noncompatible telephones, especially those made abroad.
   Current law requires ``essential'' phones to be
telecoil-compatible. These include coin-operated phones and phones
that are credit-card operated in places where no coin phone is
nearby.

Doctors removed bone slivers from her left hip to replace the discs.

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops on Wednesday shot and killed
three guerrillas north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in
southern Lebanon, the army said.
   The troops were searching for rocket launching sites and
guerrilla strongholds when they spotted a guerrilla ring and opened
fire, an army spokesman said. He said there were no army casualties.
   Israel radio said the guerrillas were apparently on their way to
carry out an attack in the security zone, a six-to-10 mile wide
strip of land north of the Israeli border.
   Troops discovered three bodies while searching the area of the
clash, the radio said.
   Neither the army spokesman nor the radio identified the group to
which the guerrillas belonged. The location of the clash also was
not disclosed.
   The incursion north of the security zone was the first reported
by the army since a two-day operation early last month in which
three Israeli soldiers were killed and 17 wounded. Forty guerrillas
of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem Hezbollah (Party of God)
movement were killed.
   On May 25, about 600 Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen assisted
by Israeli artillery and helicopters again attacked Hezbollah
strongholds. Forty Hezbollah guerrillas were killed and about 30
wounded in clashes. Five militiamen were also wounded.
   Israel radio quoted a senior officer in the army's northern
command as calling Wednesday's search operation a ``routine mission
on the security zone's border'' carried out by a small infantry
force.
   Israel established its security zone in June 1985 when it
withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon following a three-year
occupation. The zone is patrolled by Israeli troops and
Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen.

   Throwing American military might into the
fight against drug smugglers won't work because suppliers will find
a way to meet the growing demand in the United States, the head of
the congressional General Accounting Office said Wednesday.
   ``As long as the demand stays high, sealing the borders probably
isn't realistic,'' Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Asked if adding U.S. military forces to the overworked civilian
law enforcement agencies will help cut drug smuggling, Bowsher
replied, ``I don't think we have any statistics that show that's
going to happen.''
   ``Military assets are only a marginal assist'' to the anti-drug
efforts, he said.
   Bowsher noted that even though the amounts of drugs seized have
increased, so have the amounts which slipped through the net
because drug traffickers have the ability to increase production
sharply.
   Bowsher made clear he wasn't suggesting abandoning efforts to
interdict drugs, but he told the panel that ``an increasing number
of drug experts believe that the root cause of our national drug
problem is the demand for illegal drugs.''
   ``Since our current approach is not working, it is time to
consider devoting more emphasis and more resources aimed at
reducing demand _ prevention, treatment and research on the causes
and extent of drug abuse,'' he said.
   Bowsher's assessment was offered as the committee opened a
series of hearings into proposals to have the Pentagon become more
deeply involved in the anti-drug effort.
   The House last month voted to order President Reagan to have the
armed forces essentially seal U.S. borders against smugglers. The
Senate approved a less-expanded military role, but did decide to
give Navy officers arrest powers for drug boats seized in
international waters.
   The two proposals were added to each chamber's defense budget
bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Differences between the
measures, including the anti-drug provisions, will be worked out by
a House-Senate conference committee.
   Military officials have opposed a wider Pentagon role in the
drug war, saying the armed forces lack the necessary training and
equipment.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman,
said it was time ``to set aside rhetoric and passion and make
significant improvement in the war on drugs.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., top Republican on the panel, said
``Congress is on a stampede and we need some direction ... We need
to try and corral this stampede and point it in the right
direction.''
   Bowsher said federal officials estimate hey are seizing only 20
to 25 percent of the cocaine and 10 percent of the marijuana being
illegally imported into the United States.
   If the Pentagon does get involved, drug traffickers will likely
react by trying other ways to get the drugs into the United States,
Bowsher said.
   ``Whenever interdiction has been effective(in the past), they
have been able to move to other ways'' of importing the drugs, he
said.
   He said ``increasing military support would probably result in
more drug seizures and arrests, and but it may not significantly
reduce drug supplies'' because traffickers have shown the ability
to increase the overall amount involved.
   But the military impact could be large, he noted. Pentagon
officials ``believe a substantial increase in military assistance
could adversely affect military readiness.''
   In addition, he noted, increasing the military role ``would be a
significant departure form this country's longstanding tradition of
separating national defense and civilian law enforcement
responsibilities.''
   That separation's chief legal expression is the Posse Comitatus
Act, an 1878 law that bars using the military to enforce civilian
laws.
   It was amended seven years ago to permit the military to help in
the anti-drug effort, but that aid has chiefly been limited to a
supporting role. The military's major effort has been spotting and
tracking suspected drug boats or planes.
   The federal government is now spending three times more money on
reducing the supply of drugs than on reducing demand, according to
a GAO study.
   But the watchdog agency concluded that ``despite the increased
funding, there is a continuing heavy demand for drugs by U.S.
consumers. Americans want drugs, and they are willing to pay a high
price to get them.''
   Bowsher's assessment was seconded by a RAND Corp. study that
said an increased role for the military isn't likely to do much
good.

<HEAD>Rebels Withdraw Authorization For Red Cross Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing rebels said Wednesday they
will no longer authorize Red Cross activities throughout most of
Mozambique, claiming troops launched devastating attacks on
designated Red Cross aid drop sites.
   The Mozambican National Resistance said airborne forces attacked
such sites June 3-6, killing 217 civilians and wounding 391.
   It said in a note released in Lisbon that during those three
days, air force planes dropped napalm bombs on civilians who were
supposed to receive Red Cross food and medical attention at Mulumbo
and Derre in Zambezia province and Tambara in Manica province.
   The note, signed by the rebel group's spokesman in Lisbon,
Manuel Frank, said Mozambican, Zimbabwean and Tanzanian paratroops
took part in the attacks.
   The rebel note said those gathered at the cities included no
rebel guerrillas and that no rebel bases exist in the towns that
were bombed.
   However, the note contradicted itself by saying the towns were
under the rebel's control at the time of the attacks.
   Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambican National Resistance,
``has decided to withdraw authorization for free movement ... by
the Red Cross in the provinces of Nampula, Zambezia and Manica
until the situation is clarified,'' according to the note.
   It said the rebels will allow the Red Cross to keep operating
its humanitarian programs in neighboring Sofala province.
   The rebel group has fought to topple the Marxist government
since 1977, two years after the southern African nation achieved
independence from Portugal.
   The rebels and and South Africa have denied repeated Mozambican
charges that South Africa has kept supplying the rebels despite a
1984 Mozambican-South African non-aggression pact.

   Thousands of music-loving Muscovites huddled under
umbrellas in summer showers as the New York Philharmonic and a
Soviet orchestra joined in a Wednesday evening concert capped by a
fireworks display.
   Zubin Mehta, music director for the Philharmonic, and Soviet
conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky drew shouts of ``Bravo, bravo!''
after each led the 200-member orchestra.
   The covered stage in Moscow's Gorky Park resembled a
checkerboard of musicians with the Soviets from the State Symphony
Orchestra of the Ministry of Culture dressed in black and the
Americans in white. In each row, an American and Soviet sat next to
one another, accentuating the pattern.
   The concert was the seventh and final engagement in the
Philharmonic's 10-day tour of the Soviet Union, which ends
Thursday. The orchestra gave previous performances in Leningrad's
Bolshoi Hall and three at Moscow's Tchaikovsky Hall.
   ``May we thank you on the last day of our tour for your
incredible hospitality and the warmth of your public that we will
not forget for a long time,'' Mehta told the audience in Gorky Park
prior to the concert.
   Rozhdestvensky was first on the program with Dmitri
Shostakovich's ``Symphony No. 5,'' followed by Mehta conducting
Hector Berlioz's ``Symphonie Fantastique.''
   The concert began under threatening skies and gusts of wind, but
when the rain began about 20 minutes into the program, only a few
people left.
   Musicians left their seats during the fireworks display and
moved to the front of the stage to watch the multicolored bursts
above the roof of the theater. Rozhdestvensky, his arm draped
around Mehta's shoulders, watched from the front edge of the stage.
   Although they listen intently at concerts, Soviets generally are
restrained in their applause. But the Philharmonic drew sustained
and loud applause at each of its concerts.
   ``I enjoyed it so much,'' said 53-year-old Tanya Lesina. ``It's
the first time for me, hearing someone coming from New York. ... I
hope this can continue.''

<HEAD>Mitterrand Breaks Silence, Appeals For Legislative Majority</HEAD>

   President Francois Mitterrand appealed Wednesday to
French voters to elect a National Assembly majority that will help
his Socialist government carry out its programs.
   Mitterrand's Socialists and a center-right coalition ran almost
even in the popular vote after the first round of voting Sunday.
But computer projections gave the Socialists an edge in next
Sunday's runoff elections.
   ``I need, to carry out my mission, a stable majority ready to
vote without delay for laws on social justice, equality of
opportunity, national solidarity and economic modernization,''
Mitterrand said at a weekly cabinet meeting led by Premier Michel
Rocard.
   The statement was released by Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert
Vedrine.
   Mitterrand called early legislative elections less than a week
after his May 8 re-election to a second seven-year term.
   On Wednesday, Mitterrand spoke out for the first time in the
legislative campaign _ he had said previously that he would get
involved only ``if necessary.''
   In his statement, the Socialist president said he hoped for the
largest possible majority behind ``the values of liberty, equality
and respect for others'' and said it was his duty to warn French
voters ``against any coalition of electoral interests that might be
lacking in these principles.''
   Rocard said later the president intended to criticize the
relations between the center-right alliance and ``the racist and
xenophobic extreme right.''
   The extreme-right National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the
conservative coalition agreed Tuesday not to run against each other
in key districts in and around the southern port of Marseilles,
where the runoff would otherwise have split the vote three ways and
made a Socialist victory more likely.
   Socialist leaders denounced the deal, while conservatives
defended it as a purely local accord, similar to those made by the
Socialists and Communists.
   But former Socialist Premier Laurent Fabius said the accord with
the National Front was a ``dishonor for those who signed it.''
   In Sunday's election, candidates who won more than 50 percent of
the vote in the first round automatically won seats in the assembly.
   In 455 of the 577 districts, candidates who drew less than 50
percent but at least 12.5 percent of the vote in the first round
are to participate in Sunday's runoff.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Charges on Checking Accounts Took Sharp Jump</HEAD>

   Service fees paid by checking account
customers of banks and savings associations took a sharp jump in
the past year, according to a survey released Wednesday by a
national consumer group.
   The Consumer Federation of America said annual fees on
interest-bearing NOW accounts on average rose from $86.71 in 1987
to $95.33 this year, a 9.9 percent increase. Meanwhile, annual fees
on non-interest accounts rose an average 3.7 percent, from $98.96
to $102.63.
   The federation, a coalition of 200 national, state and local
groups, surveyed 110 banks and 84 savings institutions in 15 states
and the District of Columbia in April. However, year-to-year
comparisons are based only on the 133 institutions sampled in both
years.
   Fees for bounced checks were up 1.7 percent, from an average of
$13.37 in 1987 to $13.61 this year.
   At the same time fees rose, interest rates on checking account
balances were falling, the federation said, from an average of 4.66
percent to 4.32 percent.
   Thirty-six of 132 institutions lowered the interest they paid on
NOW account balances under $1,000, while 22 increased rates. The
rest did not change the rate.
   ``High balance requirements and high fees have combined to make
interest-bearing checking accounts unavailable to nearly half of
all American families,'' the organization said in a report
detailing the survey.
   ``The fees ... have placed checking accounts out of the reach of
many low-income consumers. A hundred dollars in charges is simply
too much for a family struggling to keep that amount in an account
after paying its monthly bills,'' it said.
   However, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, the
largest trade group in the industry, rejected the consumer group's
criticism, saying, ``A bank is a business, not a public utility.''
   ``Prices for bank products and services are set in a competitive
marketplace and correspond to local market demands and rising
operational costs,'' said ABA spokeswoman Mary-Liz Meany.
   She said monthly account fees were low through the 1970s because
banks were banned by law from paying interest on checking accounts.
When Congress deregulated interest rates, banks began charging fees
to reflect the cost of the accounts, she said.
   Nevertheless, she said, ``banks are among the few industries,
financial or otherwise, that offer basic, low cost accounts to
their customers.''
   She said 52 percent of the banks surveyed by the ABA last year
offered ``no frills accounts'' for an average $2 to $3 a month.
Such accounts have average balances of $300 to $400 and often
restrict the number of times a customer can write a check and visit
a teller or use a teller machine.
   Another 6 percent of banks questioned had plans to begin
offering basic accounts, she said.

   A St. Louis jail escapee wanted in a
multistate robbery-kidnap spree was chased by 40 police cars and
captured Wednesday in Fort Wayne, after his stolen car crashed into
a squad car and overturned, police said.
   Ronald L. White received only head and leg abrasions in the
crash that ended a 15-minute chase through city streets by FBI
agents, state police and Allen County deputies, police said. He was
arrested around 12:45 p.m.
   Authorities say White was involved in a series of sexual
assaults, the abduction of three people and the theft of four
vehicles since his escape Monday from the medium-security City
Workhouse in St. Louis.
   White, whose age and hometown were not immediately known
Wednesday, was taken to the Allen County Jail after being treated
at a Fort Wayne hospital, Additional charges may be filed by
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana authorities for crimes White
allegedly committed while at large, said Lee M. Quick, assistant
special agent in charge of the Indianapolis FBI office.
   Quick said about 40 law enforcement vehicles were involved in
the chase.
   White also faced charges from an Aurora, Colo., bank robbery
after he was arrested in St. Louis on a drug charge, Quick said. He
also is suspected in in bank robberies in Denver, Seattle and
Lansing, Mich., officials said.
   ``The FBI received a tip that White was en route to Fort Wayne
from Indianapolis and that he had a relative in Fort Wayne,'' said
police Sgt. Keith Butts.
   ``A stakeout was set up at the (relative's) house, but the
suspect rammed an FBI vehicle and fled,'' Butts said.
   White was captured a short time later in a stolen car matching
the description of one owned by a woman he abducted in Missouri,
officials said.
   The kidnapping charge involved the abduction of a 60-year-old
St. Jacob, Ill., gas station attendant who was reported missing
Tuesday night and was found unhurt the next morning, tied up in an
Indianapolis motel, Quick said.
   White drove out of the St. Louis jail Monday after stabbing a
dairy truck driver in the leg who was making a delivery to the
lockup, authorities said. White abandoned the truck minutes later,
then got 27-year-old Michael Crawford to take him to south St.
Louis, where he picked up his 25-year-old girlfriend and threatened
Crawford with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford then crashed his car against an apartment house after
White threatened to kill him with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford was not injured and White fled, but his girlfriend, who
was treated for facial cuts from the accident, was arrested, police
said.
   White also is suspected of entering the residence of a
19-year-old St. Louis woman, sexually assaulting her at knifepoint
four times and forcing her to accompany him in her boyfriend's car,
police said.
   The woman later jumped from the car when White tried to make her
cash checks at a bank drive-up window. White drove away in the
vehicle, the FBI said.
   He was being held in the workhouse awaiting extradition to
Denver, Quick said. Authorities said they found $20,000 in
travelers checks taken in the robbery of a suburban Denver bank in
his car.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Orders Separate Trials for North, Poindexter,
Others</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES with signficance of the ruling, details on the
immunity problem and Gesell's prior statements on the issue; PICKS

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case ordered four
separate trials Wednesday to allow Oliver North and three
co-defendants to use each others' immunized congressional testimony
to defend against the charges.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell gave independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh until Friday to decide whether to proceed first
with a trial of North on 16 charges or to try former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter on seven counts.
   The judge said arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim
could be tried individually after North and Poindexter go to trial
separately on charges they conspired to defraud the government by
illegally diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   Although the severance was requested by the defense, Gesell's
ruling could be a boost to the prosecution's ability surmount legal
difficulties posed by the congressional immunity given three of the
four defendants.
   The judge appeared to have devised a solution to the immunity
problems that he previously had said were most troublesome to him.
   North, a fired National Security Council aide and a retired
Marine lieutenant colonel, Poindexter and Hakim, were granted
so-called ``use immunity'' by Congress for their testimony at the
Iran-Contra hearings last year. Secord testified before Congress
without such immunity.
   Under the law, Walsh cannot use the congressional testimony of
an individual defendant as evidence against that person under the
limited immunity grants.
   But Gesell said ``any defendant should have considerable leeway
to use indirectly ... and possibly directly immunized testimony
while defending the charges against him.''
   ``Each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers
helpful to his own defense, if not exonerating some aspect'' of the
case, Gesell said.
   ``Each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony of
other witnesses,'' Gesell said, noting statements by Hakim and
Secord that the congressional testimony of North and Poindexter
would help their cases.
   Accordingly, separate trials are needed because trying the
defendants jointly would compromise each defendant's Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment
right to challenge the testimony of a co-defendant or another
witness through cross-examination, the judge said.
   At an earlier hearing, Gesell said he had been troubled by the
conflict between these two constitutional rights that would
inevitably occur at a joint trial of all four defendants.
   Four trials also will free Walsh to use the immunized testimony
of one defendant against another. Under the ``use-immunity'' law,
Poindexter's testimony, for example, may be used against North and
the other defendants but not against the former national security
adviser.
   The prosecution also could use the testimony of a convicted
defendant against another defendant subsequent trials.
   Walsh, who had urged a joint trial of the four defendants,
declined to comment on the judge's decision, saying only that
``everyone realizes that four trials are more burdensome than one,
but the judge feels that that's a necessary requirement to protect
the constitutional rights of all four defendants.''
   Walsh declined to say whether he would try Poindexter or North
first.
   Gesell, meanwhile, said he had not made final decisions on
whether the congressional immunity posed such a serious problem as
to preclude trying the cases at all.
   But Gesell's decision to give each of the defendants' separate
trials may seriously undermine the defense argument that the
immunity problem requires dismissal of the charges altogether.
   The judge said he would decide that and other major pre-trial
issues by July 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial.
   The judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue the
trials until after the November election, saying prospective jurors
would have to be questioned about whether political discussions
about the Iran-Contra affair would undermine their impartiality.
   Gesell's ruling, however, could help Secord, Hakim and North,
who want to use the immunized congressional testimony as evidence
they acted under the authority of Poindexter. The former national
security adviser and retired Navy rear admiral told Congress he
authorized the diversion of arms sales profits to the Contras.
   But during arguments on the issue earlier Wednesday, Walsh said
Poindexter ``knew very well he had no power'' to authorize the
diversion of Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. ``His
lack of power was obvious to anyone with intelligence,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh also hinted that other minor participants in the
Iran-Contra case still may be charged.
   ``All of the peripheral figures have been carefully left out,''
of the 23-count indictment returned against the four defendants in
March, the prosecutor said. ``They will be dealt with differently
later.'' He did not say who may be charged.
   Besides the three charges involving the diversion conspiracy
against all four defendants, Poindexter is accused in four separate
counts of obstructing congressional inquiries about the Iran-Contra
affair and making false statements to Congress.
   North also is charged with lying to Congress about efforts to
help the Contras, obstructing Attorney General Edwin Meese III's
inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair in 1986 with false statements
and destroying documents.
   He also is charged with accepting an illegal gratuity by
allowing Secord to install a $15,000 security fence around his
house and obstructing an FBI investigation of who paid for it; and
with converting to his personal use $4,300 of the $90,000 in
travelers checks a Contra leader gave him to cover expenses he and
others incurred to help the Nicaraguan rebels and seek release of
U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   He is also charged with conspiring with two conservative
fund-raisers to illegally use a tax-exempt foundation to raise
money for the non-exempt purpose of arming the Contras.

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker said Wednesday that God has
given him a plan to save PTL as a Christian retreat, and if the
ministry is sold for non-religious purposes, it will be cursed.
   Bakker said he has started raising money to buy back the $160
million televangelical empire he built over 14 years and lost 15
months ago after a sex and money scandal. He refused to say how
much money has been raised.
   Asked if he had the resources to buy PTL, he said, ``God does.''
   ``God has given us a plan how to pay for it and how to restore
it,'' he told The Associated Press after a brief news conference.
``The same God that has given me the vision to build it has given
me a vision to maintain it.''
   Bakker did not reveal details of his vision.
   Bakker said he would try to buy PTL's 2,300-acre Heritage USA
complex in Fort Mill piece by piece as it is liquidated in
bankruptcy court.
   The ministry is as much as $130 million in debt. A
reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of PTL's assets is
up for final approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds on
June 16 in Columbia.
   Under the plan, a separate, non-profit corporation called
Heritage Ministries would be formed to run the cable television
show and church at Heritage USA. However, even those operations
were threatened as PTL officials said they haven't raised enough
money to pay TV affiliates.
   George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte, N.C., Knights minor-league
baseball team and the new Charlotte Hornets of the National
Basketball Association, is among those who have expressed interest
in buying Heritage USA. Shinn would like to build a baseball
stadium there.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, returned to Fort Mill on
Tuesday from Gatlinburg, Tenn., and set up in an office about a
mile from Heritage USA.
   ``We are prepared to do whatever it takes to restore PTL,''
Bakker said Wednesday. ``We are also prepared to wait. If anyone
takes Heritage USA and turns it into anything other than what it
was dedicated, I'm convinced it will be cursed.''
   Bakker met Wednesday with supporters in the office, which had
been headquarters of the Bring Bakkers Back Club. The meeting ended
with a prayer session in which he read from the Bible.
   Then, everyone stood up, reached their arms toward Bakker and
began talking and chanting. Some appeared to speak in tongues.
   Bakker resigned his ministry March 19, 1987, as a story about
his tryst with former church secretary Jessica Hahn was about to
break. His successor, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, banished Bakker after
the Internal Revenue Service said Bakker and his aides diverted
millions of dollars from the ministry.
   ``God forgives anyone of sin. We must live in love,'' Bakker
said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Curb Violence on TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted approval Wednesday of a bill
designed to curb violence on television.
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., exempts
members of the television industry from federal antitrust laws for
three years to allow them to work together to develop voluntary
standards on TV violence.
   The bill was approved on a voice vote. The action sends the bill
to the House, where the Judiciary Committee plans to hold hearings
shortly.
   A similar bill, also sponsored by Simon, was approved by the
Senate in October 1986, but the measure was a casualty of an
end-of-the-session logjam in the House.
   The TV networks and others in the TV industry have argued that
antitrust laws prevent them from taking joint action to develop
standards on violence.
   In hearings last year before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
experts cited studies and reports that excessive violence on TV
incites aggressive behavior in children.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, however, found
constitutional problems with the bill because it would set a
precedent for government to influence the viewpoints presented in
the media.

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest Presbyterian denomination
prepared Wednesday to consider a proposed policy statement
condemning even the slightest government involvement in church
affairs.
   The policy, entitled ``God Alone is Lord of the Conscience,''
would have the 3-million-member Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) oppose
government denials of tax-exempt status from religious institutions
that violate federal laws and attempts to ``deprogram'' members of
cults.
   It also would oppose prayer in public schools and the use of
substantial public funds by religious schools, and would defend the
right of clergy and laity to take part in public affairs, including
running for public office.
   The church opened the first full day of its annual meeting
Wednesday by electing Rev. Dr. C. Kenneth Hall, 63, as moderator,
or chief spokesman, for the denomination.
   Hall, pastor of the 640-member Hill United Presbyterian Church
in Butler, Pa., defeated four other candidates on the first ballot
of the 630 delegates.
   He said the unusual first-ballot win reflected delegates'
concern over the loss of 300,000 members since 1983, when the
denomination was formed by merging the former United Presbyterian
Church in the United States of America and the Presbyterian Church
in the United States, the southern stream.
   Hall said his victory gave him a mandate to concentrate on
evangelism and healing in the church. He selected 50-year-old Ruth
Montoya of Arvada, Colo., as vice moderator.
   The proposed policy paper says government intrudes on religious
freedom by denying tax exemptions, designating churches as
landmarks and using zoning laws to prohibit church programs.
   It calls for the church to continue ``attention to court cases
concerning religious liberty and efforts to assure competent legal
advice on these issues.''
   The paper, prepared by the church's Advisory Council on Church
and Society, was given to the Committee on Justice and Social
Issues for review. The full assembly is to vote on the paper
Tuesday, the second-last day of the meeting.
   The paper criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court decision revoking
the tax exempt status of Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist
school in South Carolina, because the independent school did not
follow federal equal opportunity guidelines.
   The paper also criticizes state laws sanctioning forced
`deprogramming'' of cult members, saying ``the charge of
brainwashing is exaggerated and the response of deprogramming under
physical restraint is indefensible.''
   The paper adds that, ``It is undoubtedly true that television
evangelists manipulate more peoples' emotions in our society than
do proselytizing cults.'' The paper opposes a constitutional
amendment ``to permit public schools to sponsor prayer'' and ``the
use of substantial public funds to support private educational
systems, including tax deductions or credits and use of educational
vouchers.''
   Presbyterian clergy and laity have a right and responsibility to
be involved in public affairs, including holding elective office,
the paper says.
   It also reaffirms the church's opposition to the appointment of
a U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.
   The paper expresses concern about government refusal to
recognize ``conduct motivated by conscience,'' such as
conscientious objection to military service, civil disobedience and
the housing of illegal aliens.
   ``We need not agree with the specific dictates of another's
conscience to respect and support the right to exercise that
conscience,'' the paper says. ``We are called to obey God rather
than men.''

   President Reagan played down any disagreement
Wednesday with Vice President George Bush about the Soviet Union,
but underscored his belief that Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``definitely wants changes in the social structure there.''
   Bush a day earlier offered a different view.
   ``I don't agree that we know enough to say that there is that
kind of fundamental change, a turning inward, a la China, on the
part of the Soviet Union. I don't feel that way,'' the vice
president said Tuesday. He said Gorbachev was ``stylistically
different, obviously generationally different'' but ``my view is
the jury is still out'' on his intentions.
   Reagan was asked about the apparent difference with Bush during
a White House question-and-answer session with reporters from
around the country.
   Denying he was on a different track than the vice president, the
president said, ``I think he's being as careful, as we all must
be.''
   However, he said Gorbachev was different from other Soviet
leaders.
   ``This doesn't mean that you lower your guard precipitiously at
all but ... he definitely wants changes in the social structure
there and he's faced with a great econmic problem there, literally
a basket case and he has plans and these plans ... are part of his
plan for trying to build up the economy and make it more viable
than it presently is,'' Reagan said.
   The president also expressed eagerness to campaign against
likely Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. He said his
advice to Bush, the Republican standard-bearer, was: ``George, wait
until you and I get out there on the trail, and start pinning him
down on the things he claims, which we know are not true.''
   Reagan said that if he listened to Dukakis enough, ``I would be
convinced that we're in an economic downturn, and that people are
homeless, and people are going without food and medical attention,
and that we've got to do something about the unemployed.''
   The president spoke of the economy and unemployment figures in
glowing terms and said he would do ``everything I can'' to help
Bush win.
   ``Yes Mr. President, good jobs and affordable housing and health
insurance for working families are what the American dream is all
about,'' Dukakis said in response to Reagan's criticism.
   ``And we can do a lot better than we've been doing to make that
dream come true for every citizen in the land,'' Dukakis said.
   On other subjects, the president:
   _Said Jesse Jackson, the runnerup to Dukakis, had ``impressed a
great number of followers. And I want to say without any inference
to any racial difference or anything, I would have to say I find
myself in great disagreement with policies that he has proposed as
well as those of the other candidate, Dukakis.''
   _Refused to retract his statements in Moscow about American
Indians that had drawn widespread criticism back home. ``I don't
regret that,'' Reagan said. He said ``there were mistakes made back
in the very beginning of our country with regard to the Indians and
the manner of handling them.''
   In Moscow, he had said the United States had ``humored'' Indians
by putting them on reservations. He also misspoke by saying Indians
were not citizens.
   _Reacted coolly to Gorbachev's proposal for a joint U.S.-Soviet
mission to send an unmanned rocket to Mars. He said the American
space program had been thrown behind in schedule by the tragedy of
the Challenger space shuttle explosion, and that he had referred
Gorbachev's idea to U.S. experts.
   ``Incidentally, we've already sent a craft to Mars, as you know,
in the past (and) taken some pictures that make you wonder why
anyone would want to go there,'' Reagan said. The audience chuckled.
   Discussing his recent five-day visit to the Soviet Union, the
president said, ``The Russian people have taken to both these
glasnost (openness) and perestrokia (structural reforms) and have a
far better feeling about their system. I didn't run into the kind
of cynicism that I've seen so often in the past among them.''
   He added, ``I think (British Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher
was right when she said he's someone you can do business with.''
   As he has done several times in the past, Reagan suggested he
had met with other Soviet leaders, although Gorbachev is the first
general secretary of the Communist Party with whom he has conferred.
   ``I have known a number of their leaders and met with a number
of their leaders before, and I must say, he (Gorbachev) is
different,'' Reagan said.
   He said that Gorbachev, in their talks last week, was ``very
careful'' not to express any preference in the U.S. presidential
race.

<HEAD>High Court Rules Italian Courts Can't Prosecute American
Archbishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's highest court on Wednesday ruled that
an American archbishop and two other Vatican bank officials cannot
be prosecuted on fraud charges stemming from the collapse of
Italy's biggest private bank.
   The Constitutional Court upheld a lower court ruling that threw
out arrest warrants against Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, president of
the Vatican bank, and two other Vatican bank officials.
   Prosecutors accused Marcinkus and the two lay officials,
Pellegrino de Strobel and Luigi Mennini, of being accessories to
the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano.
   The Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano, then Italy's biggest bank,
collapsed in 1982 after it was unable to collect $1.3 billion in
loans made to 10 dummy companies in Latin America that were
controlled by the Vatican bank.
   Marcinkus, of Cicero, Ill., at the time headed the Institute for
Religious Works, the Vatican bank's formal title.
   Milan authorities issued arrest warrants in February 1987 for
Marcinkus, de Strobel and Mennini.
   The Constitutional Court on Wednesday upheld a previous ruling
from the Court of Cassation. The lower court threw out the arrest
warrants because of a Vatican-Italy treaty that says the Vatican, a
sovereign state, is not subject to interference from any Italian
authority.
   The Constitutional Court did not address directly the
jurisidiction issues raised by the treaty, saying only that the
Cassation Court had final say in the case.
   The Court of Cassation had rejected a lower court ruling that
the arrest warrants were legitimate because the bank failure
occurred in Italy.
   The Vatican bank, a major shareholder of Banco Ambrosiano,
agreed in 1984 to pay $250 million as part of Banco Ambrosiano's
bankruptcy settlement. But it said the payment was not an admission
of responsibility.

   Former San Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto
was cleared provisionally Wednesday of all charges by the referee
of a State Bar Court trial over a $5.2 million legal fee in a 1975
antitrust case.
   Alioto's son, Joseph M. Alioto, faces charges from the case, in
which the plaintiffs, beef ranchers, won a $9 million settlement in
their case against three supermarket chains. The son's hearing
continues.
   The 73-year-old former mayor could have faced disbarment,
suspension or probation had he been found guilty. The referee's
decision is subject to approval of the bar's Review Department, bar
spokeswoman Anne Charles said.
   Earlier Wednesday, before the elder Alioto testified, he had an
indication of the outcome. Referee C. Thorne Corse was reported to
have told associates he was inclined to dismiss the charges against
the senior Alioto.
   Alioto issued a statement thanking the bar court ``for a just
and fair trial which has resulted inevitably in complete
vindication. ... I was confident I could prove the charges were
nothing more than vicious and baseless attacks on my reputation and
my practice.''
   Alioto was charged with collecting an `unconscionable fee'' and
acts of unethical conduct in the case, brought by plaintiffs
including Wyoming beef rancher Courtney Davis.
   The Aliotos said the fee was not unconscionable because their
clients, cattle ranchers, were receiving more than the $9 million
settlement because they also would receive 20 cents a pound more
for their beef.
   The former mayor also repeatedly maintained he had nothing to do
with the negotiation of the settlement.
   Alioto and his son were accused of acts ``moral turpitude,
dishonesty and corruption'' in taking a $5.2 million fee for
handling the case.
   Alioto told Corse, testifying only for himself, that he had been
told over the telephone by his son, a member of his firm, that the
plaintiffs had been offered $9 million.
   He said he advised his son to ``take the money and run.'' The
former mayor repeated to State Bar prosecutor Jerome Fishkin that
although he owned the firm he had not been involved in reaching the
settlement or the fee.
   He said responsibility for matters in the business had been
delegated while Alioto ran for mayor. He said he played only a
minor role in the settlement later on because he was busy being
mayor, an office he held in the late 1960s and early '70s.

   Federal agents searching for illegal fireworks
in East Coast ports have seized 7 million spinners, cherry balls,
Roman candles and other dangerous pyrotechnics imported from China,
officials said Wednesday.
   The goods, valued at almost $1 million, were seized over the
past two months during ``Operation Eastern Thunder'' at ports in
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Charleston, S.C., and Miami, said Terrence
Scanlon, chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Searches earlier this year at West Coast and Great Lakes ports
resulted in the seizure of 54 million units of fireworks valued at
$4 million, Scanlon said.
   The seized fireworks represent about 6 percent of the nation's
total retail market for fireworks, he said.
   Scanlon said the joint effort by his office, U.S. Customs
Service and the Coast Guard extends the search for illegal
fireworks from roadside stands to shipping docks for the first time.
   Inspectors seized fireworks with improper warning labels,
unstable bases, defective fuses and excessive powder, officials
said.
   In 1987, more than 9,000 people were treated in U.S. hospital
emergency rooms after suffering injuries in fireworks accidents. An
estimated 12,600 injuries linked with fireworks in 1986, according
to federal statistics.

   Leftist union members staged a
nationwide 24-hour strike Wednesday to demand higher wages, with
six scattered incidents reported but no casualties, police said.
   Most factories, banks, schools and public offices closed for the
day. The buses that did run carried few passengers and most were
driven by their owners.
   Police said a parked, empty transit bus was burned in Montevideo.
   The strike by members of the PIT-CNT, Uruguay's largest union,
was the sixth since 1985, when civilian President Julio Sanguinetti
was elected and restored democracy after 12 years of harsh military
rule.
   Labor Minister Hugo Fernandez Faingold called the strike
counterproductive, saying ``much more is lost than won'' by a
national walkout.
   Inflation averaged 58 percent over the last 12 months in this
nation of 3 million people, half of whom live in the capital. The
government says real wages fell 50 percent from 1968 to 1985,
prompting worker unrest and demands for wages to match the rising
cost of living.

<HEAD>Cold Front Brings June Chill To The East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front was working its way slowly southward through the
mid-Atlantic coastal states and the Midwest on Wednesday, to bring
significantly cooler weather to the eastern half of the nation by
Friday.
   Temperatures behind the cold front were about 20 to 30 degrees
cooler than the readings to the south.
   Thunderstorms developed along the front in Virginia and parts of
the upper and middle Mississippi Valley. Green Bay, Wis., got its
first measureable rainfall since May 9. Thunderstorms also
developed in Montana.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread in Florida, Georgia
and South Carolina. Scattered thunderstorms ranged from eastern
Wyoming to western Kansas, with showers lingering over coastal
Oregon and northern California.
   Temperatures were in the 90s over most of the Great Plains, in
the lower Mississippi, Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys and across
the Carolinas, with a few 100-degree readings from western Kansas
across western Oklahoma to western Texas.
   Behind the cold front, readings were only the 60s with some
upper 40s and 50s over northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin and
northern Minnesota.
   In the far west, temperatures ranged from the 50s and 60s over
the Pacific Northwest, to the 80s and lower 90s in the desert
southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Houghton Lake, Mich., to 110 degrees at Altus AFB in
Oklahoma. The nation's low was 22 degrees at Truckee and South Lake
Tahoe, Calif.
   The national weather forecast for Thursday called for scattered
showers will extend from New England across New york and eastern
Pennsylvania to the mid-Atlantic states. Showers and thunderstorms
will reach from Oklahoma across eastern Texas, the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys to the south Atlantic coastal
areas. Scattered thunderstorms will develop from western South
Dakota across eastern Wyoming to eastern Colorado. Showers and a
few thunderstorms will occur over the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures will be in the 50s over New England and New
York; in the 60s or 70s from the mid-Atlantic states acrooss the
Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the upper half of the Mississippi
Valley to eastern portions of the northern and central Plains; in
the 60s or 70s from the Pacific Northwest to northern and coastal
sections of California; over 100 degrees in portions of southwest
Texas and the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs will be in the 80s
or 90s.

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese extremists seeking to
disrupt Thursday's regional elections detonated a bomb in a crowded
market, killing four people, a Sri Lankan military official said.
   The official said Sinhalese radicals on Wednesday also fatally
shot a candidate for the southern District Council.
   Authorities blamed the pre-election violence on the People's
Liberation Front, an ultra-nationalist group from Sri Lanka's
ethnic Sinhalese majority.
   District Council elections were called under terms of an
Indian-brokered peace accord signed on July 29, 1987, and intended
to end a separatist war by the Tamil minority. The war has cost
more then 8,000 lives since 1983.
   Sinhalese radicals claim the pact makes too many concessions to
Tamils and have vowed to kill anyone who supports it.
   A total of 166 candidates are competing for 53 seats on the
newly created southern District Council, the seventh to be elected
since April 28.
   Attacks by the Sinhalese radical group since India and Sri Lanka
signed the peace agreement have taken the lives of 24 council
candidates and more than 300 other people, including civilians and
party workers.
   The bomb Wednesday exploded in the market at Weligama town, 75
miles south of Colombo. The military official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the four people killed were Sinhalese
civilians.
   He said the candidate, 52-year-old A.S. Dayawansa, was shot to
death while campaigning on Wednesday in the southern district. He
was a member of the opposition United Socialist Alliance.
   Five deaths were reported Tuesday, including one candidate, a
policeman and a civilian.
   Other violence in the past two days included the burning of
government buses and several courthouses.
   Storekeepers said Sinhalese extremists told them to close
Wednesday, and police said the group ordered a ``curfew'' on
Thursday to keep people from leaving their homes to vote.
   Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists, are more than 75 percent
of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and Tamils, predominantly Hindu,
make up 18 percent.
   Tamils claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, who control the
government and army, and rebels seek a separate homeland in the
Tamil-dominated north and east to be called Eelam.
   The peace agreement called for Tamil rebels to lay down their
arms in exchange for more autonomy in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka, but the largest insurgent group continues to fight.
   India has more than 50,000 troops on the island trying to end
the rebellion. It became involved because it is the region's
dominant power and has 60 million Tamils in southern Tamil Nadu
state.
   District Council elections in the Tamil-dominated areas have
been delayed by the fighting, but officials hope to hold them next
month.

   The Internal Revenue Service has backed away
from its interpretation of a part of tax law that could have made
deferred benefits such as the vacation pay and sick time of public
and nonprofit employees' taxable, according to a Treasury
Department letter released Wednesday.
   O. Donaldson Chapoton, assistant secretary for tax policy, said
in the letter that ``bona fide'' vacation leave, sick leave,
compensatory time, severance pay, disability pay and death benefits
will not be taxable under Section 457 of the tax code.
   ``I am very happy that the IRS has decided to drop its unfair
interpretation of Section 457 of the tax code,'' said Rep. Raymond
McGrath, R-N.Y., at a news conference.
   ``This is certainly good news for the public employees of the
states,'' McGrath said. ``It is certainly good news for the
tax-exempt employees. ... It signifies that the IRS will not be
picking the pockets of these employees.''
   McGrath estimated that the some 14 million state and local
employees nationwide would have been affected, as well as untold
numbers of workers in nonprofit organizations.
   The president of the 1.1 million member American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees _ the nation's largest public
employee union _ applauded the decision.
   Gerald W. McEntee said in a statement that he was ``happy and
relieved that the Internal Revenue Service has backed away from its
plan to start taxing hard-won fringe benefits.''
   In January 1987, the IRS issued a public notice that Section 457
_ which provides rules for certain types of deferred compensation
for employees of state and local governments and tax-exempt
organizations _ would be interpreted to apply to ``nonelective''
deferred compensation.
   Nonprofit employee organizations and public employee unions,
fearing the rule would have applied to benefits that were never
taken, deluged legislators with petitions asking for help in
changing the rule.
   The IRS change came one day after Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y., introduced legislation to rescind the measure.
   Moynihan had measured praise for the IRS' decision, but said
some problems remain, such as what constitutes bona fide
compensation and how deferred cash compensation will be handled.
   ``I will discuss the matter with Treasury and with public
employee and tax-exempt employee groups, and pursue legislative
relief to the extent problems remain,'' he said in a statement.
   McGrath, who is a co-sponsor of a similar bill in the House,
credited Vice President George Bush for assisting in the debate
between Congress and the IRS on the issue.
   ``I called the vice president to explain the concerns of
millions of union members and elected officials from New York and
other states,'' McGrath said. ``He contacted Treasury Secretary
James Baker, who had the IRS reconsider its position.''
   But both Moynihan and McGrath admitted neither bill has a great
chance of passing this year because there will be no appropriate
legislative vehicle, such as a tax bill, to which their bill could
be attached.
   The IRS will formally announce its decision in the next week,
according to Chapoton's letter.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities are investigating air traffic
controllers at O'Hare International Airport after they made three
mistakes in two days this week, including one that led to a
near-miss, officials said Wednesday.
   ``The significant increase in operational errors, from 12 in all
of last year to 20 already this year, set off concern for us,''
said Mike Benson, a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington.
   O'Hare is the world's busiest airport in terms of takeoffs and
landings.
   Benson said four investigators would arrive in Chicago, possibly
by Thursday, and focus on O'Hare's radar room, where most of the
mistakes have been made.
   The radar room routes air traffic in a 30-mile radius of O'Hare
while controllers in the tower primarily direct takeoffs and
landings, he said.
   Radar controllers have been responsible for 15 of the 20
mistakes, including the three earlier this week, Benson said. Last
year, they made nine of the airport's 12 errors.
   On Monday, a United Airlines Boeing 727 carrying 128 passengers
to Ontario, Calif., came within 1,200 feet of a Lear jet after
takeoff, said Dan Sheehy, a United spokesman.
   The pilot of the Lear jet filed a near-midair collision report,
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   United did not file a report because it and the FAA consider a
near-collision to be when two aircraft come within 500 feet of each
other, Sheehy said. The United pilot did not need to take any
evasive action but the company is investigating the incident, he
said.
   Later Monday, a United 727 bound for Washington flew near a
Cessna 172 shortly after takeoff, Sheehy and Benson said.
   ``The captain did take evasive action, but the separation was
3,000 feet,'' Sheehy said.
   The third error involved an American Airlines DC-10 and a Midway
Airlines Boeing 737 on Tuesday, Benson said, but he could provide
no other details.
   The investigators will interview a cross-section of controllers,
including those involved in the errors, and examine things such as
training, quality assurance and amount of overtime worked.
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, based in
Washington, said controllers at O'Hare and other airports
nationwide are overworked.
   ``We would welcome any type of outside oversight right now,''
said John Thornton, the group's national coordinator. ``Our concern
right now is not only for air traffic control problems at O'Hare.
Around the country we're seeing short staffs, equipment problems
and sometimes an insensitivity on the part of the FAA to resolve
these problems.''

   The West Coast teamed up with the East bloc on
Wednesday when the Soviet Union's largest film studio and a small
Hollywood company formed the first U.S.-Soviet joint movie venture.
   Mosfilm, the Soviet Union's largest filmworks, signed a
long-term contract with FresFilm to produce several movies,
beginning with a portrayal of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812.
   Soviet director Sergei Solovyev described the agreement as ``a
realistic first step toward cultural cooperation'' following the
summit in Moscow last week between President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The first film, ``Rendezvous With Bonaparte,'' will be ``a
Russian romance'' with political overtones, said Solovyev.
   Tom Meehan, president of FresFilm, described the agreement as a
foot in the Soviet door for his small studio.
   Although U.S. and Soviet studios have cooperated in previous
films, such as ``Bluebird'' with Elizabeth Taylor in the 1970s,
this deal is the first signed under a joint venture law.
   The law, which took effect last year, allows foreign firms to
own a stake of up to 49 percent in a company.
   ``Everyone in Hollywood wanted to be the first to be to sign a
contract in the Soviet Union,'' said Meehan, a cigar-chomping
resident of Fresno, Calif.
   ``Rendezvous with Bonaparte'' will be filmed in the Soviet
Union, Poland and France and distributed in the English-speaking
world by FresFilm. Mosfilm will have distribution rights in the
East bloc, and rights to distribute elsewhere will be negotiated
later.
   Under the agreement signed Wednesday, FresFilm will supply film
and rent cameras, lights and other advanced cinematographic
equipment to Mosfilm for scenes filmed in the Soviet Union and
Poland, said Meehan.
   MosFilm has agreed to provide 2 million rubles, or $3.4 million,
making ``Rendezvous with Napoleon'' the most expensive movie in its
budget this year, Solovyev said.
   ``We'll get everything we need to make the film,'' he said.
   The film will be based on a novel by Bulat Okuzhava, a beloved
Soviet lyric poet and bard.
   ``One of the aims of Napoleon invading Russia was to bring
freedom to the Russian people,'' to introduce the ideas of the 1789
French Revolution and topple the czar, said Solovyev.
   ``But when he tried to do so by force, the Russian people rose
up and defeated him. However, his ideas remained,'' said Solovyev.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Sues to Overturn NRC Licensing Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state attorney general asked a federal appeals
court Wednesday to overturn a rule that could ease the licensing of
the controversial Seabrook nuclear power plant over the objections
of Massachusetts officials.
   Attorney General James Shannon argued that the rule, which lets
utilities draw up their own emergency evacuation plans when states
refuse to cooperate, poses ``a great risk to the safety of the
citizens of Massachusetts.''
   Shannon contended that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission adopted
the rule precisely to bypass state officials' opposition to opening
of the plant in Seabrook, N.H.
   William Briggs, attorney for the NRC, said the regulation
balances the interests of utility companies and public safety.
   Last year, the NRC adopted the rule allowing the commission to
consider evacuation plans drafted by nuclear plant owners if state
and local authorities refuse to offer their own proposals.
   The rule presumes that state and local officials will follow the
utility's plan in case of an actual emergency.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis so far has thwarted the
licensing of Seabrook, a completed but still idle reactor two miles
north of the Massachusetts border.
   Dukakis maintains that no emergency evacuation plan can
safeguard residents of six coastal Massachusetts towns within 10
miles of Seabrook.
   The three judges on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
questioned attorneys on both sides but gave no indication of how
and when they might rule.
   During arguments, Appellate Judge Raymond Acosta questioned
Briggs about the wisdom of yielding emergency planning duties to
utilities. ``It seems to me it's a little like the fox guarding the
henhouse,'' Acosta said.
   ``But who's the fox?'' Briggs countered.
   ``Let's face it. These are money-making operations,'' the judge
said, referring to the utilities.
   Shannon argued that the NRC's own regulations require
``reasonable assurance'' of ``adequate protective measures'' for
the public in case of a nuclear accident.
   That standard requires the cooperation of state and local
authorities in handling traffic, fire and rescue operations, he
said.
   The NRC unreasonably presumes that states will cooperate in an
actual disaster, Shannon said, but he insisted that Massachusetts
could not and would not cooperate.
   The attorney general also argued that the new regulation entails
``an impermissible delegation'' of the governor's public safety
duties.
   Briggs said the NRC acted within its powers in approving the
regulation. He contended that Shannon's position would give states
a veto power over nuclear licensing decisions, usurping a
responsibility Congress has given to the NRC.
   He also said the NRC has never lessened the public safety
standard that evacuation plans must meet.
   Shannon was supported by attorney Karla Letsche, representing
the state of New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo and New York's Suffolk
County, as well as Ellen Weiss, representing the Union of Concerned
Scientists.
   Cuomo prevented New York officials from participating in
emergency planning for the Shoreham plant on Long Island and
steered an agreement between the state and Long Island Lighting Co.
two weeks ago that will prevent the $5.3 billion plant from ever
generating salable power.
   Meanwhile, selectmen in Groton, Mass., voted Monday to stop
paying their share of the Seabrook plant, saying it looks unlikely
they will ever see power from it.
   Gary L. Hunt, general manager of Massachusetts Municipal
Wholesale Electric Co., which made the investment for the town,
called the vote ``horribly irresponsible.''
   MMWEC last week decided to stop paying its share of the
maintenance of Seabrook but to continue to pay interest on its
share of the plant's debt. The Groton selectman voted to stop all
payments, including debt interest.

<HEAD>Zia Trip Reported Canceled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan has
canceled a visit to the United States scheduled for next week,
informed sources said Wednesday.
   The trip was to include talks with President Reagan and a speech
to the U.N. disarmament conference in New York.
   Questions were raised last month about whether Zia would make
the visit after he dismissed the Pakistan government headed by
Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo.
   Zia on May 30 accused the Junejo Cabinet of incompetence and
corruption and of failing to maintain law and order. He then called
for new elections for the National Assembly within 90 days, acting
under a provision of the Pakistani constitution.
   The Pakistan Embassy said it would have no information until
Ambassador Jamsheed Marker returned from Islamabad, where he had
gone to make preparations for t he visit.
   Plans for the Washington leg of Zia's visit had remained
tentative and had not been confirmed, according to a U.S. source
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier Zia actions had been praised by U.S. officials for
progress toward restoring democracy in the South Asian Moslem
country. The 64-year-old army general had seized power in a 1977
bloodless coup, and appointed Junejo prime minister in March 1985,
after national elections. He later ended martial law.
   But dismissal of the Junejo government prompted the State
Department on May 31 to say it hoped that the required elections
would be held promptly and that they would be free and fair. Later
reports from Islamabad told of growing doubt in the Pakistan
capital about prospects for prompt elections.

<TEXT>
   The Veterans Peace Convoy of food and
medical supplies for Nicaragua was stopped short of the border
Wednesday by officials who said the mission violates restrictions
on trade with the Central American nation.
   About 100 members of the convoy that started from four U.S.
cities on May 21 said they would stay in this border city until the
U.S. government allows the caravan to cross the border.
   The group camped Tuesday night in Laredo and planned to cross
the border Wednesday morning with about 40 tons of supplies. U.S.
Customs officials, though, told them the supplies could cross, but
the vehicles could not.
   U.S. Customs officials said they were told by the Foreign Assets
Control of the Treasury Department to enforce Nicaraguan trade
regulations at the border.
   ``The Treasury Department has reason to believe that the
Veterans Peace Convoy intends to leave its convoy trucks in
Nicaragua as a donation to certain groups in that country,''
according to a Treasury Department statement.
   The restrictions prohibit the unlicensed export of goods from
the United States to Nicaragua, but do not prohibit ``donated
articles such as food, clothing and medicine, intended to be used
to relieve human suffering.''
   Treasury officials contend that taking trucks to Nicaragua would
violate the trade embargo, and told the convoy it would have to
post bonds totaling the value of all of the vehicles.
   ``It is a very usual, ordinary and customary procedure,'' said
Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman.
   ``We, on our own, met with them last night (Tuesday) to try to
advise them of some requirements of the U.S. government, including
customs and other agencies,'' said James Purser, chief inspector of
U.S. Customs in Laredo.
   In addition to the bonds, which the group says would total more
than $100,000, the vehicles would have to be returned to the United
States within 30 days.
   ``This effectively stops the passage of our convoy for the
moment,'' said Gerry Condon, of Santa Cruz, Calif., and a member of
the convoy's steering committee. ``We are not prepared to post the
bonds.''
   About 150 tons of food, concentrated milk for children, diapers,
hospital beds, toys and bicycles have been collected from churches,
hospitals and citizens for the trip to Nicaragua.
   Some of the aid was planned to be shipped later, to be turned
over to representatives of humanitarian agencies in Nicaragua.
   Bob Livesey, of Dorchester, Mass., a convoy organizer, said
Tuesday that the convoy had been in 20 states since leaving Maine
on May 21. The convoy reached Laredo after leaving Austin on
Tuesday.
   It had been scheduled to reach Nicaragua June 18.
   ``This convinces us that they are engaged in selective
enforcement against us because of who we are, veterans, and because
of the message we are carrying,'' said Stephen Somerstein, a
Brooklyn, N.Y., lawyer with the convoy.
   Members of the convoy said the trip and its publicity would
highlight their opposition to the Reagan administration's trade
embargo on Nicaragua and its support of the anti-government rebels
known as Contras.
   Somerstein said attorneys with the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights are representing the convoy in negotiations
with the Treasury Department, and that some type of legal action is
being contemplated.

<TEXT>
   The armed forces commander
announced a call-up of reserves and said Wednesday that South
African soldiers had skirmished with Cuban troops in Angola.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys said the mobilization responded to a
buildup of Cuban troops in southern Angola. He said Cuban units
were within 12 miles of the border with South-West Africa.
   South Africa governs the territory, also known as Namibia, in
defiance of the United Nations.
   Geldenhuys spoke to reporters at an air base after returning
from the war zone. He said no casualties resulted from a skirmish
last week between South African soldiers and a Cuban reconnaissance
unit near the frontier.
   South African troops in Angola aid rebels of the Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA. About 45,000 Cuban
soldiers support the Marxist government.
   South African officials have said the southward Cuban advance,
which President Fidel Castro has confirmed, could jeopardize
negotiations aimed at resolving Angola's 13-year-old civil war and
bringing independence to Namibia.
   Peace talks involving South Africa, Cuba, Angola and the United
States were held May 3-4 in London. South African and Angolan
delgations met May 13 in Brazzaville, Congo. A possible third round
of talks is in limbo because of a dispute over the meeting site.
   The South African call-up involves units of the Citizen Force, a
branch of the army made up of white men who have completed thir
obligatory two years in the military and take part in annual
training camps, subject to mobilization.
   Geldenhuys gave no details of the mobilization.
   He said a press report that 11,000 Cubans were in southern
Angola might be a useful ``rough calculation.''
   ``We have the forces to handle the situation, although the
situation is serious,'' he said. ``The point is, how does it affect
the negotiations?``

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The BBC on Wednesday rejected criticism of its
plans to broadcast a birthday concert honoring Nelson Mandela, but
the government dodged a demand to send the jailed black South
African leader birthday greetings.
   A South African Foreign Ministry statement charged that by
broadcasting the 10-hour concert Saturday, the publicly funded
British Broadcasting Corp. will be providing platform for the
African National Congress, a black guerrilla movement.
   Musicians participating include Whitney Houston, Dire Straits,
Simple Minds, George Michael, the Bee Gees, Joan Armatrading and
Joe Cocker.
   In an apparent resurgence of anti-apartheid campaigning in
Britain after months of relative inactivity, a strategy was
unveiled in London to boycott South African gold, and the BBC
screened a documentary Wednesday night alleging that black youths
have been tortured in South Africa.
   In Parliament, Gerald Kaufman of the opposition Labor Party
urged Foreign Office Minister Lynda Chalker to send a message of
``congratulations and good will'' to Mandela on his 70th birthday
July 18.
   Mrs. Chalker replied that the government supported freeing
Mandela, but said it was up to the Speaker to decide if the House
of Commons should send greetings. Speaker Bernard Weatherill,
seated in the chamber, made no response.
   Mandela, titular leader of the African National Conference, is
serving a life sentence for plotting the violent overthrow of white
rule in South Africa. The organizers say the guest of honor will be
ANC President Oliver Tambo.
   ``It is ironic that, while increased efforts are being made in
the U.K. to curtail funding for organizations using violent
methods, the ANC is offered this financial windfall,'' the South
African statement said.
   Nearly 60 other countries will broadcast the concert, including
the United States and the Soviet Union, the BBC said in a
statement, adding it is paying no fee to the promoters.
   The BBC broadcast a documentary Wednesday night which has also
drawn South African protest. ``Suffer the Children'' interviews
parents, lawyers, priests and children as young as 11 years old who
say they have been tortured and held for months without being
charged.
   The South Africans say the program is biased and did not give
their government the right of reply.
   Meanwhile, a new anti-apartheid group calling itself the World
Gold Commission announced plans to try to block the sale of gold
mined in South Africa, the world's largest producer.
   South Africa produces 52 percent of the gold mined in the West,
receives half its foreign income from gold sales and raises a
quarter of its taxes from the gold industry, the group said.
   By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The country's 5 million whites control
the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.

   Negotiators met Wednesday for a sixth
straight day in the 14-week-long strike by movie and TV
scriptwriters.
   Both sides have declined to comment on the progress or substance
of the talks at the headquarters of the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers.
   Negotiators for the Writers Guild of America and for movie and
TV producers went back into session with federal mediators
Wednesday afternoon, said union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   They had met for nearly 12 hours the night before, adjourning
early Wednesday morning.
   The writers struck the film industry March 7 in a dispute over
residuals for reruns of one-hour television shows. Demand for such
programs as reruns is declining, and the producers want to tie
payments to a show's success in the rerun market.
   The writers are also seeking more creative control over changes
made in scripts during filming, and more on- and off-screen credit.
   The guild has signed full-term contracts with about 80
independent producers, but the alliance says those producers employ
only a fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

<HEAD>House Panel To Investigate Dropping of Indictment Against George
Will's Wife</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with diGenova's statements that report is
inaccurate; diGenova is cq; NO pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee is investigating
allegations that Justice Department officials improperly quashed a
criminal indictment of the wife of syndicated columnist George
Will, a source said Wednesday.
   WUSA-TV, which reported on the congressional investigation, said
former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova intervened to stop the
indictment, overruling the strong recommendation of his assistant
prosecutors.
   The case involved Madeline Will, an assistant secretary of
education and wife of the conservative columnist who is a close
friend of Nancy Reagan and was a campaign debate coach for
President Reagan.
   The case concerned the submission of false travel vouchers,
wrongful use of a government limousine and driver and keeping an
employee on the government payroll for months after the employee
stopped working.
   DiGenova, reached at home Wednesday by The Associated Press,
said the report that he stopped an indictment of Mrs. Will was
``totally inaccurate'' and that he acted only after receiving the
consensus of career, non-politically appointed prosecutors in the
department.
   ``There was disagreement as to how the case should be handled,''
said diGenova, who left the U.S. attorney's job March 1 to join a
private law firm. ``Rather than make the decision personally, I
referred back to them for a group decision. That group recommended
to me that it not be handled criminally but that it be referred to
the civil division for civil action,'' he said. The reason for that
decision was insufficient evidence against Mrs. Will, he said.
   Neither Mrs. Will nor her husband could be reached for comment
Wednesday evening.
   The House Subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental
Relations ``is looking into several investigative cases at the
Department of Education that also involve the Justice Department,''
a spokesman for the panel told The Associated Press, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A source said the hearing June 23 would include the Madeline
Will case.
   In 1986, the Education Department's inspector general's office
found that Mrs. Will submitted false travel vouchers for
reimbursement. She said it was her secretary's fault, WUSA reported.
   Investigators also found that she used a government limousine
and driver to take her to a local beauty salon and repeated lunches
at a Capitol Hill restaurant, the TV station reported.
   Mrs. Will denied the allegations, but admitted keeping an
employee on the federal payroll for nearly four months even though
the employee did not come to work, WUSA said.
   Investigators referred the case to the U.S. attorney's office
for criminal prosecution. On June 10, 1986, chief prosecutor
William Block recommended that Mrs. Will be prosecuted, the station
reported.
   But diGenova said Wednesday that Block was part of the group of
prosecutors that recommended to him that the case be turned over to
the civil division. ``Mr. Block came back with the group ... and
they recommended to me that it not be handled criminally, but that
it be handled civilly.''
   Mrs. Will was never indicted and remains an assistant secretary
of education. She did repay the Treasury Department the $12,022
paid to her missing employee from the settlement resulting from the
civil proceedings, according to department records.
   An attorney who worked on the case but who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said, ``The thought that this was a cover up
or that (diGenova) overruled a decision to prosecute is absolutely
absurd.''

Conflict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng urged the Soviet Union on
Wednesday to play a greater role in ending Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Li as telling Soviet Vice
Premier Yuri Maslyukov at a meeting Wednesday that ``We believe the
Soviet Union can do a lot'' to end the conflict in Cambodia.
   The agency also said Li praised the Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan.
   China says the three obstacles to normalizing political ties
between Beijing and Moscow are the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan;
Soviet support for Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia; and the
concentration of Soviet troops along the Chinese-Soviet border.
Relations have been strained since 1960.
   Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping has said there can be no
summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev until the
obstacles, particularly the conflict in Cambodia, are removed.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev denied at a Tuesday
news conference in Beijing that his government is pressuring
Vietnam to pull its troops out of Cambodia. However, he expressed
support for recent proposals for Cambodian peace talks.
   Li also was quoted as saying that China thinks highly of the
recent U.S.-Soviet summit and hopes the superpowers will continue
serious talks over reducing strategic nuclear weapons.
   The repot said Li and Maslyukov also discussed economic reforms
in their countries.
   He said the situation varies in different socialist countries,
but many are carrying out reforms to bring into full play the
superiority of socialism.
   Maslyukov was in Beijing to attend a meeting of the
Chinese-Soviet Commission to Expand Trade, Scientific and
Technological Exchanges.
   The two sides on Wednesday also signed three documents on
economic cooperation.
   Although political relations remain cool, two-way trade has
climbed steadily. It reached $2.5 billion in 1986, up from $1.9
billion the previous year.

   Actress-singer Michelle Phillips'
acquittal on a possession of marijuana charge has been upheld by an
appeals court, and a prosecutor said he probably won't pursue the
case.
   Ms. Phillips, a member of the Mamas and Papas singing group in
the late 1960s, was found innocent of the drug charge by Potter
County Court-at-Law Judge Morris Overstreet, who ruled in February
that the search of Ms. Phillips' purse that yielded the majijuana
was conducted without probabe cause.
   The 7th state Court of Appeals upheld his decision on Tuesday.
   The appeal was one of the first in Texas under a constitutional
amendment in November and legislation that gives the prosecution a
limited right of appeal. Assistant Potter County Attorney Dave Kemp
said he was unlikely to continue the appeal.
   Ms. Phillips' purse was searched by two Texas Department of
Public Safety troopers. She was a passenger in an auto driven by
her boyfriend, Geoffrey L. Tozer, that the troopers stopped for
speeding on Interstate 40 near this Texas Panhandle city.
   Tozer, who consented to a car search after a single marijuana
seed was found on the car floor, was arrested but not charged.
   Ms. Phillips was charged with the misdemeanor offense of
possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, which carries a maximum
penalty of 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.

   A Navy recruit described as being
literally scared to death when allegedly forced back into a rescue
training pool died by accident because ``the system broke down,''
defense lawyers argued Wednesday.
   A prosecutor, however, contended that forcing Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki into the pool when he tried to quit the rescue course at
Pensacola Naval Air Station couldn't be blamed on the system, but
was a crime committed by people.
   ``The use of force to make people do things is not allowed by
the Uniform Code'' of Military Justice, said Lt. Cmdr. Larry D.
Wynne.
   The arguments closed a hearing into the March 2 death of the
19-year-old recruit from Appleton, Wis., at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station.
   Evidence in four days of testimony will be used by Cmdr. Daniel
J. D'Alesio Jr., the investigating officer, to make a
recommendation to Rear Adm. David Morris, chief of naval air
training, in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Morris has 120 days from the May 10 filing of the formal
complaint to decide whether any punishment is warranted.
Recommendations can include court-martial proceedings, non-judicial
punishment or dismissal of the charges.
   Charged with involuntary manslaughter are Petty Officers 1st
Class Richard E. Blevins and David J. Smith and Petty Officers 2nd
Class Frankie D. Deaton, John W. Zelenock and Michael W. Combe, all
instructors at the Rescue Swimmer School.
   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, the officer in charge of the school, is
accused of dereliction of duty.
   Witnesses testified Mirecki tried to quit training a month
before he died and was subsequently classified by a flight suregon
as unfit to continue training because he had a phobia about being
dragged under water.
   A clinical psychologist disagreed with the finding, and Mirecki
was returned to training through a series of errors without
obtaining a required physical examination and approval by a flight
surgeon, witnesses said.
   ``There was clearly a breakdown in the system,'' argued Lt.
Steven H. Cohen, lawyer for Blevins. ``The system broke down. It
failed Airman Recruit Mirecki.''
   ``It was a tragic accident,'' said retired Navy Capt. Ferdinand
Salomon, who represented Torchia.
   Mirecki's sister, Lynn Johansen, also of Appleton, and his
mother, Elaine Kitowski of Manitowish, Wis., attended the hearing.
They declined comment but issued a statement.
   ``We hope the information brought forth in this hearing will
bring about changes in the naval system to prevent this from ever
happening again,'' it said, in part.
   Testimony indicated Mirecki became frightened during a drill,
left the pool and held on to an equipment rack before a group of
instructors pried him loose and forced him back into the water.
   He then was taken back to the deep end in a head-hold by Combe,
according to testimony. There was conflicting evidence whether
Mirecki collapsed while in Combe's hold or broke free and put Combe
in a rescue hold, successfully completing the drill, before he
collapsed.
   Prosecutor Wynne derided the latter version as a ``B-movie
scenario'' concocted by the defense.
   ``It is unlikely anybody being frightened to death would have
the calm sense of the moment to perform a maneuver he had been
unable to do since the beginning of the drill,'' Wynne argued.
   The defense contended that physical contact was part of the
rigorous course and that it was not unusual for frightened, scared

   Pan Am Corp.'s board of directors has authorized
the ailing airline's management to sell most of Pan Am's assets if
agreements on labor concessions are not reached with its unions.
   The company also said it would reduce its flight operations more
than normal after the peak summer travel season.
   Financial analysts and union leaders characterized the move as
negotiating pressure, but said they also took the threat seriously.
   ``In many respects, it's a warning shot'' to the unions, said
John Pincavage, an airline analyst at the securities firm
PaineWebber Inc.
   The board's decision also could be a sort of trial balloon to
see what sort of offers emerge for Pan Am's assets, he suggested.
   In a letter sent Tuesday night to Pan Am employees, Chairman
Thomas G. Plaskett said management was frustrated at not being able
to get concessions from three of the company's five major unions.
   Unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed in
January to wage cuts and work rule changes that are to save Pan Am
$240 million over three years, but analysts have estimated the
airline needs to save around $540 million in that period to ensure
its financial recovery.
   The flight attendants, Teamsters and transport workers unions
have fought taking pay cuts.
   The board's decision authorizes the sale of any of the assets of
Pan American World Airways, the company's flagship carrier,
``without limitation, including route segments and divisions,
maintenance and terminal facilities, aircraft, engines and other
equipment,'' Plaskett's letter said.
   The only Pan Am assets which could not be sold are its lucrative
Northeast shuttle service and Pan Am World Services, which provides
ground services to other carriers in airports around the world.
   Plaskett told employees that as a first step in its new plan,
Pan Am will ``substantially reduce'' the level of its flight
operations in the fourth quarter, far beyond the normal seasonal
reduction following the summer peak.
   Pan Am also will close its flight service base in San Francisco
on Oct. 1, and will return two 747 aircraft to their lessors when
their leases expire at the end of the summer, he said.
   If agreement is reached with the dissenting unions representing
flight attendants, Teamsters and transport workers, the assets
might not be sold, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said Wednesday.
   ``We can continue along the path of an orderly sale of assets or
we can find ourselves with a labor agreement soon,'' she said.
``There is a very good possibility that the plan to sell assets of
the company would not go forward.''
   The company has no specific timetable for selling the assets,
she said.
   ``I'm taking the letter at face value; I presume that they're
serious'' about selling assets, said Margaret Brennan, head of the
flight attendants union at Pan Am who also heads the Joint Labor
Council representing the five big unions there.
   Brennan said the authorization to sell assets could be a tactic
to pressure recalcitrant unions. She cautioned, however, that ``I
don't think they're going to accomplish anything with (the flight
attendants) like this.''
   Pan Am's plan to sell assets ``is a negotiating tactic because
they're just fed up with the unions,'' said Julius Maldutis, who
follows the industry for the investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc.
``There are some great risks associated with this strategy, but
(Pan Am) had no choice.''
   Among those risks, he said, are that potential passengers could
be scared away from Pan Am flights because of the impending sales
and that many frequent fliers on the airline could stampede to cash
in their travel awards.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, had a net loss of
$83.3 million in the first quarter. The unions representing pilots
and flight engineers have agreed to concessions totaling about $240
million over three years, but analysts and airline sources believe
Pan Am needs around $540 million over the period.

<HEAD>Anti-Violence Protesters Take Over Offices of Bishops Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of men, women and children raced
into the headquarters of the Latin American Bishops Conference in
Bogota on Wednesday and occupied the building, saying they were
protesting violence in Colombia.
   A communique issued by the protesters said they called
themselves Christians for Peace.
   An anonymous caller, claiming to be one of the protesters, told
The Associated Press a priest and a nun were being held hostage
until the demonstrators got to talk with a government
representative.
   He said there were 100 protesters, including 10 children, in the
three-story building in northern Bogota.
   Police surrounded the structure minutes after the protesters,
some with scarves wrapped around their faces, stormed inside.
   The caller said the protest was against right-wing death squads,
blamed for killing more than 800 persons in Colombia in the last
three years.
   The communique said ``we want to call attention ... to the
situation of violence that exists in Colombia.'' It asked ``the
church to intervene effectively in the mediation of the conflict,''
without specifying which conflict.
   The Roman Catholic church in Colombia has repeatedly offered to
mediate between the government and leftist guerrillas, but no rebel
group has agreed.
   The protesters demanded that Attorney General Horacio Serpa
Uribe, Cardinal Mario Revollo Bravo and others come to the occupied
building.
   The attorney general, who was in Medellin, said in a broadcast
interview with the Bogota radio station RCN that he would not talk
with them.
   University students have led the takeover of a dozen embassies
and other buildings in Bogota, the capital, in the last five years
to draw attention to protests.

   In the maze-like refugee camps of
Pakistan's northwestern frontier, turbaned Afghans clad in the
pajama-like ``salwar kameez'' congregate everywhere. Women are
noticeably absent.
   The frontier province, which now is home for most of the 3.5
million refugees of the Afghan war, is a mirror image of more than
half of Afghanistan's population.
   Ethnically, the people of the frontier are of the Pashtoon
tribes. More than 60 percent of Afghans also are Pashtoons, but the
tribes are split by the Afghan-Pakistan border. The Pashtoon code
of honor that demands family, honor and religion be defended to the
death has played a major role in the Afghans' tenacity in their
10-year war.
   The ethnic minorities are many.
   The largest of these are the Hazaras, who live in Hazarajat in
north- central Afghanistan, and the Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkomans,
who live toward the north along Afghanistan's border with the
Soviet Union. Along the northeastern border with Pakistan live the
fair-haired, light-skinned Nuristanis, who claim to be descendents
of deserters of Alexander the Great's army.
   For the most part, Afghans are farmers tilling small holdings
near their villages. The grueling heat of Pakistan contrasts
sharply to the fertile valleys and enticingly cool mountains of
Afghanistan.

   In their hoveled shops, Afghan war
refugees who have sought asylum in Pakistan eke out a meager
existence. Anyone with something to sell slaps up a lean-to that
passes as a shop or simply squats on the side of a dusty road.
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World
Food Program supply food to the displaced Afghans, but the monthly
quota has never been reached.
   To supplement monthly allotments from those two relief groups
and Pakistan, the refugees open makeshift shops or take jobs in the
local community. Some Afghans prosper in exile, but they are not
the ones living in camps.
   The displacement caused by the Soviet Union's systematic
depopulation strategy in the Afghan war can be repaired, but the
human loss and injury will leave an indelible mark on Afghan
society. Widows and orphans have proliferated in the 10 years of
war.
   Attempts are made at education, but resources can't meet demand.
Improvised schools have been established. Afghan political parties
based in Peshawar have joined in the effort to educate the young. A
new generation of Afghans has been born in the camps. They know
only what they have been told.
   Hospitals, run by international aid organizations or Afghan
political parties, are overflowing with wounded and maimed. Bombs
shattered the legs of Zafar Khan, a refugee from Afghanistan's
northeastern province of Kapisa.
   He says without emotion, ``I was crippled in a bombardment.''
   Abdul Waheed lost his hand in a rocket attack.
   Their stories are not unusual.

   Afghan war refugees, haunted by
loneliness and memories of their bombed villages, their spouses or
children killed, sit for hours in the sun-baked mud homes of their
camps in Pakistan.
   The majority of the 3.5 million Afghan refugees are children,
with women making up the next largest group.
   Shrouded behind a veil or hidden behind high mud walls, women
are a society unto themselves. Transplanted from their villages,
where they openly tended their fields, to crowded camps surrounded
by strangers, Afghan women have been forced into seclusion.
   Dr. Mohammad Azam Dadfar, who runs a psychiatric center for
Afghans in Peshawar, said the exile forced on the refugees has left
millions with psychological wounds.
   If the refugees returned tomorrow to Afghanistan, the effect
would continue for years. There is a generation of psychologically
mutilated Afghans, said Dadfar. They are the children.
   Maryam was 9 years old when jets screamed over her village in
Baghland province and dumped their payload. For three days, she was
buried in the rubble of her home. Her family was dead. Afghan
guerrillas found her and brought her to Pakistan.
   In the summer, the refugee camps are treeless, parched
dustbowls; in the winter, cold damp prisons. The mortality rate
among children is high.
   ``Everyday they see their playmates die,'' Dadfar said.

   For author and journalist David Grossman, the
problem at the root of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be felt
in the chance encounters of Arabs and Jews on any Jerusalem street.
   ``When I see a Palestinian or a group of Palestinians
approaching me, there's a special look that we have developed _ us
and them _ a hollow look, a white look,'' Grossman said. ``We see
through them and they see through us. I think because its such a
wound for both of us, such a pain.''
   The 34-year-old Israeli novelist broke through the hollow looks
early last year by spending seven weeks on the West Bank,
interviewing mostly Palestinians. He wrote a series of articles
detailing their sense of unjust persecution. The articles have been
expanded into a book, ``The Yellow Wind.''
   The articles forced readers to look deep into the eyes of those
living under the Israeli military occupation that started after the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   There is Naima, a little girl of about 4 with green eyes. ``What
do soldiers do?'' Grossman asks.
   Naima replies: ``Searches and beatings.''
   Grossman: ``Do you know who the Jews are?''
   Naima: ``The army.''
   Grossman: ``Are there other Jews?''
   Naima: ``No.''
   There is Mohammed Al-Kal'ilah, whose house was knocked down
after his estranged son took part in the murder of two Jewish
couples. The son was killed and the father has become a beggar.
   ``If my son murdered, kill him. Kill him immediately!'' the man
said. ``But why have you destroyed my entire life?''
   There is another elderly villager named Abu Harb, who tells
Grossman about the yellow wind. The wind comes from the gates of
hell and sets the world on fire, Abu Harb says, exterminating all
those who have performed cruel or unjust deeds.
   The book was translated into Arabic by the Israeli Arab poet
Mahmoud Darwish, and distributed to the leaders of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. It was excerpted in The New Yorker in
January.
   The author, who is the anchor of Israel radio's morning news
show, said the shock the book created in Israel was a surprise to
him. He did not realize how much Israelis had distanced themselves
from the 1.5 million Palestinians they rule.
   ``People were caught unprepared,'' he said in an interview. ``I
think in a way it gave words to people who lacked words.''
   The frustration among Palestinians under military occupation
gave many observers the sense that the West Bank was a steam pipe
gathering the kind of pressure that eventually blows off a manhole
cover.
   Grossman said he felt it. But like most Israelis he did not
expect last December's explosion, much less a solid six months of
demonstrations, for another decade.
   ``People were really frightened,'' he said. ``Suddenly these
Palestinians, who we had always treated as kids, suddenly they were
redefining themselves without asking us. They are adults, and they
are starting to fight back.''
   Grossman rejected an offer from Koteret Rashit, the Israeli
magazine that first published the articles, to go back to the West
Bank to do a sequel to the book during the current uprising, which
has left at least 200 Palestinians and two Israelis dead.
   ``Israel is not at a time to be influenced by words. The
situation is so brutal,'' said the author, whose novel ``See Under:
Love'' is scheduled for release in the United States next February.
``It is a time for politicians, not for writers.''
   Grossman is critical of the entrenchment among Israel's right
wing led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. In moving to expel
moderate Palestinians leaders such as non-violent advocate Mubarak
Awad, the government is choosing the language of force over
dialogue, he said.
   ``There are still enough elements in Israel that are afraid of
using this turning point as a lever to salvage the situation, to
give it a new definition,'' he said. ``I think politicians should
not be led by fears. Israel suffered during the last 40 years some
very severe dangers. But to make our fears an ideology is a very
bad choice.''
   He thinks the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was a
lost chance to give the Palestinians a home of their own, and
thinks that such a homeland and guaranteed security for Israel
could emerge from the current demonstrations.
   ``We now see them only in their fury, but I know behind their
mask of hatred there are people like me and you, although Jews
don't like this comparison,'' he said. ``There is a great part of
the population that is starting to want to live a normal life.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Repudiates Attack On Dukakis, Voices Pride In Him</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One name Iakovos is cq.</NOTE>

   Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos has denounced
an attack on the religious status of Democratic presidential
contender Michael Dukakis, saying he always has embraced the church.
   The Greek Orthodox community also is proud of him, Iakovos said,
noting that if Dukakis wins the presidency, he would be first
member of that faith ever to fill the office.
   ``At one time, only WASPS could run,'' the archbishop said,
White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants have held the presidency except for
1961 to 1963 when John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, was in the
White House.
   It would be fitting to include a Greek Orthodox, Iakovos said in
an interview. ``We have learned to respect one another as is proper
for co-existence. In our multicultural, multinational society,
religious belief is not one of the criteria for being elected
president of the United States.''
   Dukakis is scheduled to address Greek Orthodoxy's biennial
clergy-laity congress July 3-8 in Boston, where about 3,000
delegates and guests are expected to give him a brotherly,
typically festive Greek reception.
   ``We are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and
determination to run for the highest office in the nation,''
Iakovos said, adding that he's offering no formal endorsement,
something the church avoids.
   The white-haired 76-year-old archbishop, noting that Dukakis
calls him his ``spiritual father,'' said, ``I put it that 99
percent of us are very proud Dukakis is a front-runner and almost
certain nominee.''
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican presidential
candidate and an Episcopalian, also is to address the Orthodox
gathering.
   Iakovos, leader for 29 years of America's 2 million Greek
Orthodox, sharply repudiated an attack on Dukakis' faith by James
Jatras, a church layman and staff member of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee.
   In widely distributed letters, Jatras said Dukakis ``defames the
church'' by some of his positions and is a ``an apostate ...
renegade and outcast'' for his marriage to a Jewish woman.
   ``The attack is wrong in itself,'' Iakovos said, calling it
``extremely unjustified'' and the ``fanatic'' work of ``small
people.''
   Dukakis ``is a member of the church, was baptized in it and he
has never left it... He has embraced it all these years. This is
not something new. Many times, he has said I was his spiritual
father,'' he said.
   Iakovos has maintained a long-time warm relationship with
Dukakis and his parents, encouraging him in his bids for the
Massachusetts governorship, and more recently, in seeking the
presidency.
   The two still meet and talk occasionally, such as on April 14
when Dukakis visited the church's Manhattan headquarters and took
part in vespers services, later chatting with Iakovos in his office.
   ``He has a good head on his shoulders,'' the archbishop said.
``He's very learned. He is moderate, not a man of extremes.''
   While his marriage to a non-Christian technically bars him from
receiving Communion, Iakovos emphasized he remains a church member.
``He is not excluded. He's not the only one who has married outside
the church.''
   In fact, he said, about 70 percent of Orthodox marriages are
with those of other denominations and increasingly with Jews.
   ``It's happening more and more now,'' he said. ``I have a
pastoral obligation to all our people, to strengthen and encourage
them. A religious leader cannot ignore that obligation to all
members of the faith.''
   In a new book, ``Faith for a Lifetime,'' published by Doubleday,
Iakovos offers his reflections on faith and life.
   Jatras' letter, mailed widely to bishops and others, also
accused Dukakis of condoning murder and communism by upholding the
law allowing abortion and for opposing aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Iakovos said, ``I find it extremely unjustified to make such
statements.'' While the church condemns abortion, he said that
political leaders must uphold the law. ``This is something that
some clergy and others do not understand. The president is
president of all citizens, believers and non-believers as well.
   ``Any transgression across the border betrween state and church
is at the expense of the unity of the nation.''

   A shipment of 10,000 Jewish high holy day prayer
books in Hebrew and Russian was flown to Moscow this week as a gift
to Soviet Jews by the Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, foundation president, said approval for
the prayerbooks to enter the Soviet Union conformed with recent
statements of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev calling for more
tolerant attitudes toward religion.
   The interfaith foundation of Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish
and Eastern Orthodox leaders seeks to advance religious freedom
around the world.
   Schneier was in Moscow this week as the only American Jewish
leader invited to address ceremonies marking the 1,000th

   Church historian Bill J. Leonard says
Southern Baptist churches increasingly are assigning more power to
the clergy, leading to a ``clergification'' of the denomination.
   Leonard, of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said the
trend toward autocratic leadership by pastors often threatens to
degrade the status of lay people. ``It makes the laity second-class
citizens. It undermines the most basic biblical understanding of
the church as the whole people of God.''
   He said the clergy leadership style is becoming similar to a
``chief executive officer of a corporation'' and is ``more publicly
visible in so-called superchurches, but is also quite prevalent in
smaller churches.''

   Unlike some Roman Catholic dioceses that have
closed down services sponsored by the homosexual group, Dignity,
the Chicago Archdiocese simply has taken over the sponsorship.
   In doing so, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin said he was
``concerned that gay and lesbian Catholics receive the pastoral
care of their church'' and ``to make sure the church's teaching on
human sexuality is presented clearly.''
   Officers of Dignity, which opposes the church's condemnation of
homosexual activity, welcomed the move as providing an official
church ministry to homosexuals.
   Bernardin said the group's questioning of church teachings made
it inappropriate for the group to continue sponsoring a Mass at St.
Sebastian parish, so sponsorship was being assumed by the
archdiocese.
   A l986 Vatican document prohibited use of church facilities to
groups opposed to church teachings, and several dioceses had simply
shut down Dignity-sponsored services.

   Trekkies who've been following the galactic
adventures of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock for 22 years can now join
the action in the new ``Star Trek Adventure'' at the Universal
Studios Tour.
   The attraction, which allows fans to play the parts of the
Starship Enterprise crew, Klingons and other aliens, opens today.
   Gene Roddenberry, creator of ``Star Trek,'' was an early visitor
to the attraction two weeks ago. The revolving parts of the stage
were working, but workers were scurrying to complete the 2,000-seat
theater.
   On the stage, a Klingon stood on the bridge of his Bird of Prey
spaceship and petted his Puppy Lizzard. The stage turns to bring
forward the bridge of the Enterprise, the engineering section,
transporter room and the surface of the planet Akumal 7.
   Roddenberry gave his approval for the attraction, and the
workers, recognizing him, crowded around to shake his hand.
   Roddenberry, William Shatner and other actors from the
television and movie series are scheduled to be on hand for the
opening. About 1,500 Trekkies were invited to the premiere
performance after they were the first to respond to a mailing of
26,000 invitations sent to ``Star Trek'' fan clubs.
   Leonard Nimoy, who plays Mr. Spock, is the only member of the
original cast not expected at the opening. Nimoy is directing a
movie in Canada.
   ``Star Trek'' first ran on NBC from 1966-69, then became one of
the hottest shows in reruns. Paramount Studios has so far made four
hit ``Star Trek'' movies and the current ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' has become a hit in syndication.
   ``It still amazes me that `Star Trek' has become a popular
myth,'' said Roddenberry. ``I constantly tell myself that I'm the
same guy I was when I was trying to get a script assignment. You
can't believe the press clippings. I think I do good work. Every
once in a while I do something that's very good. But I'd hate
myself if I believed all the stuff written about me.''
   Roddenberry said that when Paramount asked him to create a
television series, he asked, ``Who'll be my censor if we don't go
network?''
   He said, ``When they told me I'd be my own censor, my ears
perked up. I never thought I would ever say anything good about a
studio, but I don't get any calls about stories. Of course, the
other side is that you don't want to blow it. So you end up working
even harder.
   ``I think if I've done anything well it's that I picked good
people, gave them their head and didn't subject them to any
criticism I wouldn't want myself.''
   He said when he created the new TV show he wanted new
characters. ``The actors I was working with were too good for
`hand-me-down' characters,'' he said.
   Is he satisfied with the success of the new show?
   ``I'm never satisfied with any show I've produced,'' he replied.
``You always look at it and say, `Why didn't I do that?' But in a
sense I am better satisfied. I have more money to produce the show.
The first year of `Star Trek' on NBC I had a budget of $184,000 per
episode. That was $20,000 less than `Mission: Impossible' was
getting.
   ``But you don't get money for unsuccessful shows. The critics
hit us when we first came out. The ratings were very low. I said,
`Everyone's against us, so why don't we show 'em!' We cheated on
the budget every way we could. We even had our costumes made by
people living around the studio.''
   ``The Star Trek Adventure'' allows 29 members of the studio
audience to dress up in costumes and play various roles on stage.
The performances will be taped, mixed with footage from ``Star
Trek'' movies and computerized equipment will produce 8-minute
videocassettes that cost $35.
   There will be a new show, new performers and new videocassettes
every 30 minutes. The show was produced by Phil Hetterma, who also
produced last year's new Universal attraction, ``Miami Vice.''
   Universal also plans new attractions based on the movies ``Back
to the Future'' and ``E.T.''

<HEAD>Comeback for Aggressive Growth Funds?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For those mutual fund investors who were brave
enough to be aggressive in the wake of last year's stock market
crash, risk-taking has had its rewards to date.
   In the first quarter of this year, ``maximum capital gains''
funds tracked by the Wiesenberger Mutual Funds Investment Report
posted a 9.2 percent gain.
   The managers of these funds pulled off the elusive feat of
outperforming the overall market, as measured by Standard & Poor's
500-stock composite index. In the January-March period, the S&P 500
was up 5.7 percent.
   Does this mean that people who took last fall's market collapse
as a lesson in the hazards of speculation are missing out on a good
thing?
   Not necessarily. But with the stock market having perked up a
bit again since the end of May, the time may be opportune to take a
fresh look at the class of mutual funds that take the biggest risks
in hopes of achieving dramatic returns.
   Such funds are known by several names. In addition to ``maximum
capital gains,'' they are often described as ``aggressive growth''
or ``capital appreciation'' funds.
   ``In the 1960s,'' recalls Sheldon Jacobs in his Handbook for
No-Load Fund Investors, ``such funds were called `go-go,' a term
that fell into disrepute after the 1974-74 stock market debacle,
when the go-gos went-went.''
   By any name, these funds resemble free-swinging sluggers in
baseball. They go for home runs, and they also tend to strike out a
lot. Their dividend yields are usually meager at best.
   Rather than blue chips, these funds are prone to investing in
smaller companies with bright promise, or ``turnaround'' stocks of
troubled companies, whose days of prominence may be far in the
future _ or never come at all.
   Over long periods of time, however, the best of the aggressive
growth funds have produced some spectacular results. By Jacobs'
reckoning, $10,000 invested in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in
January 1975 would have grown to $334,150 by December 1987.
   To experience that kind of prosperity in the real world, of
course, your timing has to be pretty good. As it turned out,
January 1975 was an ideal occasion to be making stock investments.
   But it was hard to see that then, with the market having fallen
drastically, the economy in recession, and the nation still nursing
the wounds of Watergate and an energy crisis.
   It is impossible to say whether similar opportunities exist now.
While analysts at Standard & Poor's Corp. have recently published a
list of recommended aggressive growth funds in the firm's weekly
publication The Outlook, they aren't urging any headlong rush to
buy them.
   ``While our favorites in this category are expected to produce
worthwhile capital gains over a period of years,'' they said, ``it
would probably be wise to defer new purchases until the investment
climate improves.''
   Questions of timing aside, who should consider aggressive growth
funds, and who should avoid them?
   John Laporte, president of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund,
which invests in small growth companies, put it candidly in a
recent comment:
   ``To participate in this sector you have to be a long-term
investor, be tolerant of volatility, and be able to accept the risk
of extended periods of underperformance.
   ``Investors who fit that description might consider having
one-third to one-half of their equity investments in the emerging
growth area, because these stocks have consistently done better
than the general market over long periods of time. My guess is that
this will continue in the future.''

<DATELINE>PHANAT NIKHOM, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In March 1986, Nguyen Thi
Xuan-Sac sent her 15-year-old daughter on a boat to Thailand. Four
months later, she sent another daughter, then 11 years old, on the
same journey.
   Mrs. Xuan-Sac knew it was risky. Thousands of other Vietnamese
boat people, including her own sister in 1981, have been lost at
sea or attacked by pirates.
   But she sent the girls off anyway in the hope they would
eventually find new homes in the United States.
   The girls reached Thailand safely and now live outside
Washington, D.C., in Lanham, Md.
   ``I felt that if I died, there would be no one to take care of
my daughters,'' said Mrs. Xuan-Sac, whose husband fled Vietnam in
1976. ``And Vietnam is very poor and my daughters could not study.
... I want them to be happy.''
   Mrs. Xuan-Sac now is a refugee herself in Thailand and wants to
join her daughters in Maryland.
   Her situation is similar to that of many other Vietnamese and
Indochinese parents who have sent their children on the risky
voyages across the Gulf of Thailand in hopes they will find new
lives in the West.
   Except for the United States, however, Western nations are
reluctant to take the children.
   International aid officials are at odds among themselves over
the practice of parents sending their children away.
   Some see it as cruel, but others say what must be taken into
account is the Vietnamese value system that the future of offspring
is extremely important.
   Since the 1975 communist victories in their homelands, more than
10,000 Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian children under 18 years
old have made their way to United Nations-aided camps in Thailand
without parents or adult guardians. More than 1,000 of these
``unaccompanied minors'' remain in this camp near Bangkok,
Thailand's capital. An unknown number are among about 400,000
Indochinese in other Thai camps.
   Resettlement nations that refuse to accept the unaccompanied
children do so partly in the belief the parents send them off as a
precursor to their own expatriation and resettlement.
   International refugee officials call the practice an abuse of
international humanitarianism.
   Australia, for example, maintains that resettling minors only
encourages separation of families and countries should try to end
the exodus.
   Mrs. Xuan-Sac said in an interview life had been difficult since
the communists in 1975 closed the company where she worked and
ordered her family to toil on the land. She said she lost contact
with her husband after he fled in 1976 and knows only that he is
living somewhere in the United States.
   She said she never intended to follow her daughters, but then
couldn't bear the separation and made her way to Phanat Nikhom and
now wants to join them in Maryland.
   The United States, which has taken two-thirds of minors
resettled from Thailand, said in a recent policy statement it
considers the children of ``profound humanitarian concern'' because
of their vulnerability during flight and in refugee camps.
   It said the practice of purposely sending children off with the
intent of following them is ``abhorrent'' but that if families are
persecuted, the U.S. government is not concerned with whether
parents used children in this way.
   The United States attempts to resettle all minors with U.S. ties
and whose families were persecuted. It also will take half of all
other minors who demonstrate persecution in their homelands but
have no U.S. links. It also will consider ``paroling'' into the
country those with U.S. links who don't qualify as refugees.
   Some minors at a special center in Phanat Nikhom give accounts
of enduring harsh ordeals after being sent off by their parents.
   Danh Van Ha, about 7 years old, said he was on a 13-day,
storm-tossed boat journey during which pirates robbed and raped
passengers, including a woman who was taking care of him.
   Another Vietnamese boy suffered severe asthma on his journey and
was hospitalized for a long time at the camp.
   Yet the children interviewed didn't question that their parents
loved them, but instead worried about not being able to fulfill
what they see as their filial duty of getting resettled abroad.
   Bridget Messana, an American who runs the center for Thailand's
Catholic Office of Emergency Relief and Refugees, said some
children receive letters from arents angrily scolding them for
``misbehaving and taking so long'' to get resettled,
   The children here play happily, nevertheless, but Ms. Messana
said some possibly won't be able to get along with foster parents
in the United States or deal with problems likely to arise when
they're no longer in the protected environment of Phanat Nikhom.
   ``When they get to the U.S. and see the difficulty of the life
their parents sent them to, then the scars surface,'' she said.
``They've been separated. They're not in their own community. And
all of this none of their own choice.''

   Like Paul Revere, Sandy Simon goes around
shouting the British are coming. But he does it as the bearer of
good news, and his advice differs from Revere's. Don't resist, he
might say. Sell out.
   It is partly through activities of people such as Sanford R.
Simon that British interest in American business has never been
higher, with purchases announced weekly if not daily.
   For many Americans, it is one of the more baffling business
developments in years, particularly since the British economy had
until the 1980s spent years in the doldrums.
   Simon's activities help explain the phenomenon.
   Representing buyers rather than sellers, Simon, president of
American Corporate Services, searches out small- and medium-size
companies that might make attractive acquisitions.
   Many of his clients are American companies, but 20 are British
concerns and one is Swedish. All are corporations seeking to
expand, and all view the American market as the place to proceed.
   Simon's organization researches the possibilities, seeks out
companies that conceivably could be for sale and then approaches
them. ``We find and make available for sale something that isn't on
the market,'' he says.
   The potential acquisition usually involves a privatelydocument
by a 63-36 vote.
   The president vetoed the measure May 24.
   Backers of the trade legislation headed into today's Senate
showdown without enough votes to override Reagan's veto, but they
had refuse to abandon hope for the bill before thre vote.

<HEAD>``Mystery Plays'' Play On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YORK, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old God, a Hindu Christ and up to
300 Yorkshire locals have joined thespian forces in the north of
England this month as the York Mystery Plays return to the stage,
reviving a centuries old theatrical form.
   ``They so much belong to this city,'' Jude Kelly, artistic
director of The York Festival, said of the Mystery Plays, which
form the centerpiece to the city-wide festival running June 10 _
July 10.
   This year is the 10th staging of the York cycle since the
medieval retelling of the Bible was relaunched for modern audiences
at the 1951 Festival of Britain.
   Victor Banerjee, who played Dr. Aziz in the movie ``A Passage to
India,'' portrays Christ. He is the first Hindu actor to inherit a
role that previously has been held by such established British
performers as Simon Ward and Christopher Timothy. The 300-strong
lineup of amateur talent around him includes Jon Lacy Colson, 13,
as a prepubescent God.
   The Mystery Plays first appeared during the 13th century as
religious entertainments performed in the vernacular telling the
biblical story from the Creation to Judgment Day.
   Other countries have their own versions, such as the
Oberammergau Passion Play in Germany. In Britain, they were
associated with towns with significant numbers of guilds, each of
which would perform a different biblical pageant. As a thriving
medieval city and the seat of England's second bishopric, York
became known for its particular cycle of plays; other cities
(Chester, Lincoln) performed their versions as well.
   The Mystery Plays fell out of favor during the Reformation in
the 16th century, when interest shifted to William Shakespeare and
his peers. Interest was rekindled this century following World War
II, as the British started to re-examine their literary heritage.
The 1988 York cycle is an adaptation by Andrew Wickes from the
canonical version by the late Rev. J.S. Purvis.
   Religious dramas drawing on both the Old and New Testaments, the
York cycle takes over 3{ hours. Performed outdoors in a 1,514-seat
theater against the backdrop of a ruined abbey, the cycle is a
distillation of the 48 Mystery plays written in the 14th century by
the city's guilds and craftsmen.
   Performed in its entirety, the York cycle would last 18 hours,
including musical interludes; distilled, it is a stage adventure
that brings together outsiders and the local citizenry.
   ``It's a thing out of this world; you hear the first chord of
music, the butterflies go up and down and you're away,'' said Betty
Doig, a York native who first appeared in the 1976 cycle playing
Mary, the mother of Jesus, with her husband and five of their seven
children.
   This year, in addition to working backstage on props, the
67-year-old Mrs. Doig plays Noah's wife in the first York cycle
this century to include the story of Noah's Ark.
   ``I've always wanted to box a man onstage,'' Mrs. Doig said of
the role, which requires her to get angry. ``I think it's
marvelous.''
   As the lone professional in the company, Banerjee said he was
moved by the enthusiasm of his non-professional colleagues.
   ``It's like walking out of 42nd Street into a nunnery,'' he said
during a recent trip to the ancient cathedral city.
   ``You're confronted with a new version of reality _ a sense of
discovery that you'd lost; the kind of values you had when you
began.''
   As a Hindu who divides his time between homes in Calcutta and
Mussoorie in the Himalayan foothills, Banerjee said he was pleased
and surprised to be offered the role of Christ.
   ``Here I was being asked to play this part when I was living
thousands of miles away and they had millions of people to choose
from,'' said Banerjee, who makes his British stage debut in the
role.
   ``It's one thing to be chosen to play Dr. Aziz, but to play
Christ, which is traditionally regarded as a blond and blue-eyed
part, was a great thing.'' Kelly explained why she and the show's
director, Steven Pimlott, chose Banerjee: ``We both pictured Jesus
as a dangerous man in terms of what he was saying _ a dark and
wild-eyed anarchist rather than someone pale and blond.'' She said
the personal religion of the actor was unimportant.
   ``Actors are always portraying people they're not,'' she said.
``The fact that Victor is not Christian is irrelevant; as an actor,
he's so marvelous.''

<BYLINE>Apartheid Struggle Is a Winner at Cannes</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   One family's struggle against apartheid 25
years ago has come to the screen in ``A World Apart,'' a winner at
the Cannes Film Festival starring Barbara Hershey. It provides a
low-key but compelling alternative to last year's acclaimed ``Cry
Freedom.''
   Where Richard Attenborough's ``Cry Freedom'' told its tragic
story on an epic, $16 million scale, ``A World Apart,'' with its $6
million budget, tells how a daughter learns to cope with her
mother's battle against apartheid.
   ``What's important is that in America, in Britain, everywhere,
people have an inkling of what racism is,'' said Chris Menges, the
British director of the movie, which opens June 17 in New York and
July 1 in Los Angeles.
   Set in South Africa in 1963 but shot in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, last
summer, the film is a semi-fictional version of the real-life
relationship that existed between South African journalist Ruth
First and her daughter, Shawn Slovo.
   Slovo, now 38, wrote the screenplay, recreating her youth
through the character of 13-year-old Molly Roth, played by Jodhi
May, a young British newcomer.
   Barbara Hershey plays Molly's mother, Diana, who is jailed for
her activities on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC),
the black guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow white rule in
South Africa.
   In reality, First was one of a few white founding members of the
ANC, which was outlawed in 1963.
   The movie covers several months in the shared politicalization
of mother and daughter, as Molly learns to accept and understand a
kind of commitment that puts social responsibilities before
domestic concerns.
   ``A World Apart'' does not touch on later events in the family's
lives: In 1982, First was killed by a letter bomb in Mozambique.
Her husband, Joe Slovo, lives in exile today in Zambia, where he is
the general secretary of the South African Communist Party and the
only white member of the ANC executive committee.
   The film was twice honored at the 41st Cannes Film Festival,
which ended May 23. In an unusual three-way vote, Hershey and May
shared the best actress prize along with Linda Mvusi, who plays the
Roth's housekeeper, Elsie.
   The film also won the Special Jury Grand Prize _ the runner-up,
in effect, to the festival's most prestigious award, the Golden
Palm.
   It's the first feature film directed by Menges, 48, a
documentary filmmaker and cinematographer who won two Academy
Awards for his camerawork on ``The Killing Fields'' and ``The
Mission.''
   Menges said he had been looking for a film to direct and was
drawn to Slovo's script by its mixture of the personal and the
political.
   ``It's about a child coming to terms with the political choices
her parents have made; it's Shawn's coming to terms with her mom
and dad,'' said soft-spoken Menges, a father of five.
   ``It's a story about someone trying to work out the trauma of
childhood, which many of us have to work out.''
   The film exemplifies its director's devotion to material chosen
out of personal belief rather than expediency.
   ``I've always tried to work on projects I can learn from and I
think are of value,'' said Menges, who first went to South Africa
in 1963 to film a British TV documentary.
   ``I was asked to do this story, and I think it has something to
say.''
   Slovo said thoughts of her mother prompted her to write the
script, which she described in an interview as ``a mix of
autobiography, memory, and fiction.''.
   ``If my mother were still alive, I don't think I would have done
this particular story,'' said Slovo, who began writing the script
in 1983 after a stint in New York working as actor Robert DeNiro's
secretary.
   ``(But) in the aftermath of her assassination and trying to come
to terms with the violent manner of her actual death, this is the
story that evolved.''

<HEAD>Greek Archbishop Condemns Attack on Dukakis' Religion</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in the
Americas says attacks on Michael Dukakis' religious situation are
``extremely unjustified'' and that he is a steadfast son of the
church.
   ``He is a member of the church, was baptized in it and he has
never left it,'' Archbishop Iakovos says of the front-running
Democratic presidential contender, who has been assailed as ``an
apostate.''
   ``The attack is wrong in itself,'' Iakovos added in an
interview. His eyes flashed. ``It came from small people.''
   In widely distributed letters, James G. Jatras, a staff member
of the Senate Republican Policy Committee and a church layman,
called Dukakis a ``renegade, an outcast'' for his positions and his
marriage to a Jew.
   Jatras, writing under his Greek name, Dimitrios Iatreidis, said
Dukakis' church membership was ``severed by your marriage outside
the church.'' Iakovos termed that untrue.
   The white-haired archbishop, 76, who has maintained
relationships with Dukakis and his parents since his boyhood, noted
that Dukakis considers him ``his spiritual father,'' and added:
   ``We are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and
determination to run for the highest office in the nation.''
   While making no formal endorsement, avoided under church policy,
he said, ``I would put it that 99 percent of us are very proud
Dukakis is a front runner and almost certain nominee.''
   Iakovos, recalling the years 1942 to l954 when he was dean of
Boston's Annunciation Cathedral to which the Dukakis family
belonged and where he still is a regularly contributing member,
said:
   ``I remember him in his Sunday school pupil days. He was a
frequent participant as a teenager. The Dukakis family was one of
the best families in the church, his father a physician, his mother
a teacher of English.''
   Iakaovos, who has talked with Dukakis frequently over the years,
encouraging his political efforts, sometimes praying with him, said:
   ``Michael is a man who does much thinking, who doesn't react
emotionally. He has a very good head on his shoulders. He's very
learned. He is moderate, not a man of extremes. He's very prudent,
very careful, very studious.''
   Of Dukakis' marriage to a non-Christian, which under church
rules technically bars him from receiving communion (as are
divorced, remarried Roman Catholics) but does not excommunicate or
remove him from membership, Iakovos said:
   ``He did not leave the church. He is not excluded. He's not the
only one who has married outside the church.''
   The archbishop said about 70 percent of Greek Orthodox marriages
are with those of other denominations, an increasing number with
Jews.
   ``Its happening more and more now,'' he said. ``I have a
pastoral obligation to all our people, to strengthen and encourage
them.''
   He noted that Dukakis visited archdiocesan headquarters on
Manhattan's East 79th St. on April 14, took part in vespers
services and afterward met with Iakovos in his chandeliered,
second-floor offices.
   ``We had a brief service in the chapel,'' he said. ``Then we
discussed freely some of the issues.''
   Jatras made his charges in an open letter to Dukakis sent to all
Orthodox bishops and many others, as well as in letters to the
weekly Greek American which termed the attack a ``cheap political
ploy.''
   Jatras claimed Dukakis ``excommunicated himself'' by marriage to
a Jew and is ``a traitor'' who ``defames our church'' by upholding
legal abortion and opposing aid to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The archbishop said it ``was fanatic'' to attack a candidate's
church relationship. ``I find it extremely unjustified to make such
statements, to attack anyone running for any office on the basis of
his beliefs.
   ``In this multi-cultural, multi-national society, religion is
not one of the criteria for being elected president of the United
States.''
   While Greek Orthodoxy opposes abortion, he said Dukakis'
position resembled that of New York Governor Cuomo, a Roman
Catholic, in contending political leaders must uphold the law and
not try to impose their views about it.
   ``The president is president of all citizens, believers and
non-believers as well,'' Iakovos said. ``Any transgressions across
the border between state and church is at the expense of the unity
of the nation.''
   He said he had encouraged Dukakis' decision to seek the
presidency.
   Asked about Dukakis' religious commitment, Iakovos said ``this
is a very subjective matter,'' but Dukakis has been a steady church
member. ``He has embraced it all these years. This is not something
new. Many times, he would say I was his spiritual father.
   ``Through the campaign, I think he is feeling much closer to the
community than before.''
   He said that it seemed strange the attack about Dukakis'
religion didn't come until ``he was running for the presidency, but
then they start scrutinizing his conformity to church rules.
   ``If the man is qualified, and God wants him to be president, he
will be. Michael has some of the qualities we seek in that
position.''

   Unlike some Roman Catholic dioceses that have
closed down services sponsored by the homosexual group, Dignity,
the Chicago Archdiocese simply has taken over the sponsorship.
   In doing so, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin said he was
``concerned that gay and lesbian Catholics receive the pastoral
care of their church'' and ``to make sure the church's teaching on
human sexuality is presented clearly.''
   Officers of Dignity, which opposes the church's condemnation of
homosexual activity, welcomed the move as providing an official
church ministry to homosexuals.
   Bernardin said the group's questioning of church teachings made
it inappropriate for the group to continue sponsoring a Mass at St.
Sebastian parish, so sponsorship was being assumed by the
archdiocese.
   A l986 Vatican document prohibited use of church facilities to
groups opposed to church teachings, and several dioceses had simply
shut down Dignity-sponsored services.

   Church historian Bill J. Leonard says
Southern Baptist churches increasingly are assigning more power to
the clergy, leading to a ``clergification'' of the denomination.
   Leonard of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville,
said the trend toward autocratic leadership by pastors often
threatens to degrade the status of lay people.
   ``It makes the laity second-class citizens,'' he said. ``It
undermines the most basic biblical understanding of the church as
the whole people of God.''
   He said the clergy leadership style is becoming similar to a
``chief executive officer of a corporation'' and is ``more publicly
visible in so-called superchurches, but is also quite prevalent in
smaller churches.''

<HEAD>Land Access, Hunting Fees Divide Montana Sportsmen and Ranchers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEN IWANSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lorents Grosfield's 15,000-acre ranch north
of Yellowstone National Park is home to deer, antelope, bear and
game birds. It's a paradise for hunters.
   Grosfield welcomes them _ if they're among the select 100
``season permit'' holders who've paid $160 apiece for the
privilege. Guests are charged $50 more each day.
   In the East, where most land ownership shifted to private hands
generations ago, such entrepreneurship might go unquestioned. But
in the vastness of Montana, which only a century ago was mostly
wild land open to all and where most land is still publicly owned,
fee-hunting and closed lands are divisive issues.
   The dispute is also being watched by sportsmen elsewhere because
of the growing pressure on available land.
   ``It's an upwelling rather than an overwhelming wave as we see
it, but it's clearly there and it's going to become more and more
important in the future,'' said Lynn Greenwalt, vice president for
resources conservation of the National Wildlife Federation in
Washington, D.C.
   The trend toward fee hunting has sparked debate between Montana
landowners protective of their property rights and sportsmen long
accustomed to easy access to land for hunting and fishing.
   Some sportsmen accuse landowners like Grosfield of trying to
usurp a natural resource for themselves.
   ``Wildlife, we feel, belongs to the whole public, not just to
the particular individual,'' said Tony Schoonen, president of the
Montana Wildlife Federation. ``If anybody takes and uses that
resource as a personal gain, it's privatization.''
   Landowners say it's a way for farmers and ranchers to make some
extra money and ease hunting pressure by controlling the number of
hunters. Grosfield said it takes time to deal with each hunter who
calls or knocks at the door.
   ``A rancher ... is essentially subsidizing the recreating public
to the extent of the time, effort and expense it takes to
accommodate that public. There's something not equitable about
that,'' he said.
   But it's more than that.
   It's also ``kind of in response to what is seen as an overly
aggressive attitude among some recreational groups to force issues
like access _ especially with the stream access thing,'' Grosfield
acknowledged.
   The ``stream access thing'' is a raw issue in Montana. In 1985,
the Legislature codified a Supreme Court decision giving sportsmen
the right to cross property lines at will if they followed streams
and stayed between the high-water marks.
   Jerome Jack, executive vice president of the Montana
Stockgrowers Association in Helena, described the decision as a
``bitter pill'' for ranchers and farmers. Many, he suggested, are
posting their lands to hunters in frustration over losing control
of their property.
   ``You have seen a lot more orange paint on gateposts and a lot
more limiting of access during the hunting season,'' Jack said. The
orange paint designates posted land.
   But most landowners who charge hunting fees are more interested
in the money than in defending the principle of private ownership,
said Bob Carlson of the Skyline Sportsmen's Club in Butte.
   ``The trend was already started'' before stream access became an
issue, said Carlson. ``I'm sure there's a lot of people who are
using that as an excuse.''
   Fee hunting also has increased the burden on property owners who
still allow free access, Schoonen said.
   ``As more and more private property owners close their land, it
throws more and more pressure on adjacent landowners who do allow
hunting, until they throw up their hands'' and decide to close
their lands as well, he said. ``It's like a domino effect. You see
it happening all over.''
   And some landowners, while not charging a fee, have restricted
the numbers of hunters they'll allow on their land.
   Grosfield began charging fees four years ago. Before that, he
said, it got to the point where he was simply overwhelmed by
hunters.
   ``We had a terrific amount of pressure _ between 800 and 1,000
hunter days per year. Now, in looking back on it, I just shake my
head when I think about accommodating that many.''
   Many private landowners, of course, continue to welcome hunters
as long as they ask permission and conduct themselves properly.
   ``We have full, open access and it's unusual to have problems,''
said rancher Joe Etchart of Glasgow. ``We have some irritants _ cut
fences and things like that _ but it's a relatively small amount
compared to the traffic.''
   But Carlson fears fee-hunting ``is going to do away with hunting
as we have known it in the past.''

   Arthur Perdue never retired and he had a
few words of advice on the subject for his son.
   ``It's like the throttle of an engine,'' Arthur's son, Frank
Perdue, recalled. ``As you get older you turn the throttle down a
little bit.''
   Frank Perdue, at 67, may be slowing down, but it's hard to tell.
Although he recently stepped aside as chief executive officer of
Perdue Farms Inc., the nation's fourth-largest poultry producer,
he's still known nationwide as the tough guy who sells tender
chickens.
   ``It's nothing like the end of an era,'' said Perdue, who made
himself and his poultry products famous through his television
sales pitches. ``I have lots of things to do.''
   Perdue, who followed his father into the chicken business at age
10, remains chairman of the board and chief promoter of his
products. He plans to stay active in the business and keep peddling
his wares on television, while Donald W. Mabe, president of the
company, takes over the reins as CEO.
   ``I will be very visible and I'll probably be on the road a
lot,'' Perdue said in an interview.
   Mabe, who has answered only to Perdue for 28 of his 30 years
with the company, is content with Perdue in the forefront of their
marketing and advertising efforts.
   ``I don't think I can replace Frank. It would be like someone
trying to replace Colonel Sanders. Frank is so identifiable with
our product, he would be hard to replace. ... Frank Perdue is here
to stay,'' Mabe said.
   And so is his poultry business. Today, Perdue Farms has seven
poultry processing facilities and a turkey processing subsidiary,
enabling it to process 6 million broilers and 1.5 million pounds of
turkey per week.
   The company has more than 14,000 employees and holds contracts
with more than 2,000 independent chicken and turkey producers in
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Indiana.
   Perdue products are found along the East Coast from Maine to
North Carolina and are breaking into the Midwest market in
Cleveland. In fiscal year 1986-87, Perdue Farms had sales of $964
million.
   ``There are going to be ups and downs in this business because
there always has been,'' said Perdue, assessing his company's
prospects for growth. ``There is an awful lot of production right
now and when you get into a position of oversupply, you suffer
lower earnings.
   ``But looking ahead 10 years, the odds are people will be eating
less beef and less pork due to a diet-conscious public,'' Perdue
said.
   If anyone is qualified to make such a judgment, it's Perdue, who
has worked his way up from the chicken coop to the boardroom. In
1920, Arthur Perdue bought 50 Leghorn chickens for $5 and entered
the table egg business in Salisbury. Frank was put to work at a
tender age and given responsibility for the care of a few dozen
chickens.
   After graduating from high school, the young Perdue attended a
local college for two years then decided ``the egg business wasn't
as bad as I thought.''
   In 1939, Frank left college to rejoin the family business, which
then consisted of three employees, Frank and his father included.
   The operation grew, eventually shifting from selling table eggs
to the hatching and growing of broilers. When Frank became
president in 1950, Perdue Farms had 40 employees and was one of the
largest chicken growers on Maryland's eastern shore. The broilers
were sold to major companies such as Swift and Armour, which
marketed the Perdue chickens under their own brand names.
   In 1968, with 400 employees, Perdue Farms purchased its first
processing plant in Salisbury and Perdue brand chickens hit the
market.
   The company's recent expansion into turkeys was a natural
extension of the processing business. And with turkey becoming a
year-round food, the move was timely.
   Perdue Farms entered the turkey business in 1984 with the
acquisition of Shenandoah Valley Poultry Co., Inc., in Bridgewater,
Va., and Shenandoah Farms, Inc., in Washington, Ind.
   The turkey market is growing slowly, but Mabe and Perdue
predicted it will continue to become more attractive to consumers.
The company recently began producing ground turkey, which Perdue
said is popular because ``it looks a little like hamburger, but has
tremendously less calories.''
   Mabe called it a ``low-cost alternative to ground beef.''
   In the expanding prepared food market, both men said the
company's pre-cooked chicken called Perdue Done It!, has a ``good
future.''
   ``Anytime you're on the leading edge like we are with the
fresh-cooked chicken products, there are some difficulties,'' Mabe
said.
   ``The problem is getting the trial. Take the hot roast chicken.
It's probably better than what you can roast at home, but people
aren't used to buying like that,'' he said.
   Mabe said the chain stores were anxious to stock the products
because they're competing with fast-food restaurants.
   ``We've had no trouble getting shelf space on this product and
as more people take it, we'll move more of it,'' Mabe said.
   Perdue summed up the future of the company without giving away
any secrets.
   ``I think we will continue to do what we do better and as
opportunities present themselves, we'll look at them.''
   Asked if Mabe would one day become chairman, Perdue replied, ``I
would say that my demise has been tremendously over-exaggerated and
let's just say he's certainly capable. But I hope to be around for
a while.''

   Forty teen-agers from 22 states join 40
South Dakota Indian youths Saturday to live together for a week on
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
   The plan is to have them share heritages of religion, legend and
song. The hope is that the friendships formed will give them fresh
appreciation of their nation's diversity, and each individual's
worth.
   ``The whole idea is to address prejudice and discrimination in a
very subtle way,'' said Rose Marie Ohm of the National Conference
of Christians and Jews, which is sponsoring the event.
   ``It's like a big rainbow. By interacting through direct
contact, they learn to appreciate each other, how to work
together.''
   The National Conference of Christians and Jews, a non-profit
organization that works to improve communication and understanding
among conflicting groups in American society, has chosen 40
students from different backgrounds and regions of the country to
attend the youth conference.
   The United Sioux Tribes helped select Indian students from 12
tribes who live on reservations and in urban areas around South
Dakota to attend the conference, being held at the high school in
Pine Ridge.
   The Pine Ridge reservation is a region of rolling, grassy hills
topped with pine trees in southwestern South Dakota. Its territory
includes Shannon County, one of the poorest in the nation.
   Pine Ridge School Principal Imogene Horse said the meeting
should help Indian teen-agers better understand young people from
other parts of the country. Some of the students cannot afford to
travel, she said, so they haven't had much contact with people from
outside western South Dakota.
   ``I think it will be good for the Indian students beause of the
isolation factor out here,'' the principal said. ``I believe the
students and adults who attend this will learn much about each
other's cultures.''
   Ohm said the National Conference of Christians and Jews sponsors
other conferences aimed at helping young people develop leadership
skills. Participants have included Indian youths in the past, but
the Pine Ridge event is ``the first time on Indian turf,'' said
Harry Robinson, NCCJ vice president for communications.
   The conference has a theme of ``Educating for the 21st Century:
Rights, Risks and Responsibilities,'' and is designed to help the
students sharpen the skills to become leaders in a diverse socity,
Ohm said. They will work to find their own ideas for addressing the
problems of the future, she said.
   Daily workshops will deal with cultural awareness, racial
understanding, friendships, dating, family relationships and other
issues faced by all young people. By living together, the high
school juniors and seniors will also learn to get along with people
from other backgrounds, Ohm said.
   On Sunday evening, the students will fill a poster spanning two
walls at the school with their names, races, ethnic identities and
a dozen other categories, giving ``a visual representation of their
diversity,'' Ohm said.
   On the final full day of the Pine Ridge conference, June 16,
students from various ethnic groups will give presentations on
their cultures. The Indians of Pine Ridge will present a special
program.
   Arthur Zimiga, who works with a United Methodist Church program
in Rapid City to help Indian youth learn job and social skills they
need in today's world, helped recruit the Indian participants.
   The meeting should help the South Dakota students realize the
state and its Indian reservations are not isolated islands, but
instead a part of the rest of the nation, Zimiga said.
   ``These young people should have an opportunity to be a part of
the decision-making process and also to have an opportunity to
lead,'' Zimiga said.
   One of the students who will attend the conference, Mark Pakula,
a 17-year-old from Leawood, Kan., said he hoped to get a better
undertanding of people from different races and backgrounds.
   ``Everyone is a person, and they really shouldn't be treated any
differently,'' he said.

   The 1989 Ford Probe can be hazardous to drive.
The problem is not with the car, but with other folks who want to
get a good look at it.
   During the time I had a Probe GL test car, I was chased at 80
mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking new-looking Pontiac
Grand Prix who wanted to check out the Probe. Their Grand Prix just
made its debut this model year.
   I also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the
middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my Probe.
Traffic in my neighborhood picked up one Sunday as people came back
around the block to get second and third looks at the Probe.
   And the Probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people
at a Honda dealership I visited.
   It sure seems that Ford has an attention-getter with this
aerodynamic, fun-to-drive, small specialty car that was unveiled in
Chicago in February and went on sale in May. Ford already has
70,000 orders, which amounts to this year's full production at the
Flat Rock, Mich., plant where the car is built. Eventual plant
capacity could reach 150,000 annually.
   The front-drive Probe is unique in a couple ways. Though sold in
Ford showrooms, the car was designed with the help of Mazda Motor
Corp. of Japan and is being produced at the Mazda plant in Flat
Rock by United Auto Workers members.
   The plant, the first U.S. assembly plant operated by a Japanese
automaker to be organized by the UAW, also builds the Mazda version
of the Probe, called the Mazda MX-6 which shares many components
with the Probe.
   Ford, by the way, owns 25 percent of Mazda.
   But the Probe differs from the MX-6 in appearance inside and
out, conveying a more modern, sleek image. And for all the
attention it gets, it doesn't cost a mint. Base price for the GL,
the lowest-priced version of the Probe, was $10,459. The test car,
with optional premium sound system, cast aluminum wheels, air
conditioning and automatic transmission totaled $13,186.
   Ford also offers an upscale LX model which starts at around
$11,400, and a top-of-the-line performance GT, which sports a
spoiler, fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around
$13,600.
   Those prices put the Probe squarely in contention with its
Japanese competitors _ the Honda Prelude, which starts around
$14,000, and the Toyota Celica, which starts around $12,000.
   The test car, the low-end Probe GL, had commendable suspension
and good handling. However, the standard engine _ a 2.2-liter
electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder _ didn't quite seem to
deliver the power one would want in such a sleek, sassy-looking car.
   Cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough. But leg room
in the back was a problem.
   Fit and finish inside and out was admirable, and the tilt
steering was different, causing the whole steering module,
including instrument cluster, to move up and down. It was a nice
touch, considering the feature meant never having to worry about a
steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges.
   It took some getting used to the blinker. It wasn't a stalk on
the side of the steering column. Rather, it was a small lever
attached to the dash.
   Likewise, the headlights were not activated by the traditional
push-pull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a
blinker stalk. Instead, the retractable headlights came out and on
when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned.
   The rear cargo area was deep and roomy, but items had to be
lifted up and over the rear of the car. The Probe is aimed at
young, career-oriented buyers, a Ford statement said.
   Specifically, targeted buyers have a median age of 30, 55
percent are single, half are male, and they have a median annual
income of $33,000, said Ford analyst Ray Windecker. The major
occupations expected to be represented among Probe drivers include
professional-technical workers and managers, he added.
   There have been several reports that the Probe is designed to
replace the Ford Mustang, which has been around since the 1960s.
   Ford says the two cars will be sold side-by-side in showrooms,
and the Mustang will remain as long as there is consumer demand.
   Because the Probe is just arriving on the market, there are no
reliability reports.

   Americans increased their installment
borrowing at an annual rate of 7 percent in April as growth in
consumer credit slowed from the first three months of the year, the
government said.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday that consumers took out
$3.65 billion more in credit than they paid off in April, compared
with net growth of $5.2 billion in March, $5.0 billion in February
and $6.2 billion in January.
   The annual rate of growth in April was below the 7.2 percent
rate for all of 1987 and the approximately 10.7 percent pace for
the first quarter of 1988.

<HEAD>Consumers' Confidence Reported High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The confidence of American consumers jumped in May to its
highest level since the end of the 1960s, according to a Conference
Board report that could bode well for future economic growth.
   The Conference Board, a business-supported research group, says
its monthly Consumer Confidence Index does a better job of
predicting growth than the government's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators.
   In other economic news Tuesday, the government said Americans
increased their installment borrowing at a moderate annual rate of
7 percent in April as growth in consumer credit slowed from the
first three months of the year.
   And in another report, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said
interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate home mortgages climbed in May
for the second consecutive month. The national average for
conventional, single-family loans jumped to 10.63 percent in early
May, up from 10.48 percent in early April, it said.
   Stock prices fell as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
118.77 points over the past five sessions, dropped 20.62 to
2,054.59. Bond prices also sank in reaction to renewed fears of
inflation.
   Consumers' confidence seems to be the result of low unemployment
and low inflation, said Fabian Linden, executive director of the
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
   Nevertheless, the optimism was somewhat surprising in light of a
report Monday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that said
Americans' pay in the first three months of 1988 failed to keep
them ahead of inflation for the fifth consecutive quarter.
   Not since the spiraling inflation of 1979-81 have workers gone
so long without an improvement in their standard of living through
wage gains, the bureau said.
   The board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped 3.5 points to 119.2
in the May survey. That was up 16.2 points over its level of a year
earlier and the highest since December 1969, when it stood at 126.0.
   The Conference Board commissions a monthly survey of 5,000
households throughout the United States.
   ``All of the ingredients that give the consumer a sense of
well-being are working together at this moment,'' Linden said.
   The index has been kept since January 1969 and was recently
recalibrated against a base of 100 points in 1985.
   In its report on installment borrowing, the Federal Reserve
Board said consumers took out $3.65 billion more in credit than
they paid off in April, compared with net growth of $5.2 billion in
March, $5.0 billion in February and $6.2 billion in January.
   The annual rate of growth in April was slightly slower than the
7.2 percent rate for all of 1987 and considerably slower than the
approximately 10.7 percent pace for the first quarter of 1988.
   However, economists saw the slowing as a healthy trend at a time
when U.S. manufacturers are trying to boost their production for
export.
   ``What's happened is what should be happening. Consumer spending
is cooling off and freeing up resources to produce for export,''
said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a
Washington consulting firm.
   ``The whole transition from a consumer-led economy to an
export-led economy assumes we can cool off consumer demand in order
to avoid heated up inflation,'' she said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All may not be well with the American economy,
but a new survey says consumers' confidence rose in May to its
highest point since the ``Soaring Sixties.''
   The Conference Board, a business-supported research group, said
Monday its Consumer Confidence Index of 119.2 in May was the
strongest since December 1969, when it stood at 126.0.
   ``It's pretty impressive,'' said Fabian Linden, executive
director of the board's Consumer Research Center. He described
consumers as ``somewhat euphoric.''
   ``All of the ingredients that give the consumer a sense of
well-being are working together at this moment,'' Linden said,
mentioning strong employment gains and restrained inflation.
   The Conference Board commissions a monthly survey of 5,000
households throughout the United States.
   The Consumer Confidence Index jumped 3.5 points from the April
level and 16.2 points from its level of May 1987.
   The index has been kept since January 1969 and was recently
recalibrated to a base of 100 for 1985.
   The strength of consumer confidence is surprising in light of
the Labor Department's report Monday that most workers have failed
to stay ahead of inflation for five quarters in a row.
   Not since the spiraling inflation of 1979-81 have workers gone
that long without an improvement in their standard of living
through wage gains, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
   The Conference Board's survey indicated more optimism than
another report released Tuesday by the International Association
for Financial Planning, but the latter was based on a survey
conducted three months earlier.
   That survey of 1,008 peoplefound that 39 percent said it is
harder this year than a few years ago to pay their bills and still
have money left over, in contrast to 29 percent who said it was
easier.
   Also, 39 percent said the next generation will have worse
financial opportunities than those available today, while 29
percent said the opportunities would be better.
   Linden said consumers' confidence probably was helped by their
feelings of job security. The Labor Department reported Friday that
unemployment had edged up to 5.6 percent in May from its 14-year
low of 5.4 percent in April.
   The average workweek has lengthened, Linden noted, meaning
people are working more overtime and bringing home bigger paychecks.
   Also, Linden said, consumer price inflation is low enough that
it is not noticed by shoppers from week to week.
   The strength of consumers' confidence is good news for the
economy, said Linden, who contends the Consumer Confidence Index is
more accurate than the government's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators in predicting economic growth.
   Nearly 32 percent of those surveyed considered business
conditions to be good, up from 28 percent in April. Almost 31
percent said jobs were plentiful, up from less than 21 percent the
month before.
   Only 5.5 percent said they expected business conditions to
deteriorate in the next six months, down about a percentage point
from April. That figure had risen to more than 12 percent in
November, after the stock market collapse.
   Buying plans were also firm. Of those surveyed, 9.4 percent said
they planned to buy a car in the next six months, up from 9.1
percent in April; 35 percent said they planned to buy a major
appliance, the same as in April; and 3 percent said they planned to
buy a home, down from 3.5 percent in April.
   The Conference Board began monitoring consumer confidence in
1967. The index began in January 1969 and was higher than it is now
throughout its first year. It fell sharply in January 1970 as the
economy headed into a recession.

<HEAD>Texaco Promises Part of $5 Billion Asset-Sales Proceeds To
Shareholders</HEAD>

   Texaco Inc. says it plans to give its
shareholders a third of the proceeds from the $5 billion it plans
to raise by the end of the year in sales of assets as part of its
restructuring plan.
   But the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant said Tuesday that it
had not decided how the distribution would be made, promising
either a stock buyback program or some other method.
   ``The distribution may involve cash or the use of securities, in
anticipation of the proceeds to be realized from the sales
program,'' Texaco said in a statement.
   The rest of the proceeds will be used to repay debt, strengthen
the balance sheet and fund increased capital investment programs
for selected retained operations, it added.
   The move, which came in the midst of a proxy fight between
Texaco and takeover specialist Carl C. Icahn, stirred little
enthusiasm on Wall Street. In consolidated nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, Texaco closed at $51 per
share, up 12{ cents.
   Richard S. Pzena, who studies oil companies for the Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. securites firm, said traders took a dim view of the
move because ``it's not like they're giving the shareholders
something they don't already own.''
   Icahn is running a five-man slate for the board of directors,
hoping to a victory will help him get the board to let shareholders
vote on his $60-per-share cash offer for the company. The votes are
to be cast at Texaco's annual meeting on June 17.
   By adding some value to shares already hovering in the $50
range, Texaco in effect was diluting the impact of Icahn's $60 cash
offer, Pzena said, thereby strengthening its chances of beating
Icahn in the proxy fight.
   Texaco's latest announcement came just 24 hours after it said it
had agreed to sell its 99.12 percent interest in Deutsche Texaco AG
of West Germany to a major utility in that country.
   Rheinish-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG, also known as
RWE, agreed to pay over $1.2 billion for the subsidiary. Both sides
expect no problems with a requirement that West Germany's Federal
Cartel Office approve the transaction.
   Updating its progress in other aspects of its reorganization
plan, Texaco said Tuesday it expected to generate more than $1.8
billion more in two other upcoming transactions.
   One is a deal to sell 60 million barrels of oil and gas
equivalent reserves, expected to close by the end of this month.
The other involves proposals to establish joint ventures with
Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.
   The ventures, which were ``in advanced stages of review,'' would
involve three Texaco refineries and related marketing facilities on
the East and Gulf coasts.
   Studies are also continuing on what to do with its 78 percent
interest in Texaco Canada Inc., including the possible sale, merger
or joint venture of some or all of the stake, Texaco said.
   In addition, it said it was considering the potential sales of
other domestic oil and gas properites of marginal value to the
company, as well as certain European and African holdings.
   The restructuring program is also expected to yield more than
$50 million in additional savings in overhead from staff
consolidations, Texaco said.
   The latest developments are a result of months of negotiations
that began as Texaco prepared for its April emergence from a year
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection.
   In April 1987, Texaco filed for that protection to avoid having
to post an $11 billion security bond while appealing a $10.3
billion judgment held against it by Pennzoil Co. A jury ruled
Texaco had interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 attempt to acquire part
of Getty Oil Co. so it could buy Getty itself.
   In December, Texaco agreed to settle the suit by paying $3
billion to Pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included
sales of $3 billion worth of assets.
   Soon afterward, Icahn, its largest stockholder with 14.8 percent
of the company's shares, stepped up pressure on Texaco's management
to do more to increase the value of its stock.
   In March, he threatened to run his slate of five candidates,
including himself, for Texaco's board, if the company did not take
steps that would raise the price to $55 per share from then-current
levels in the $35-to-$45 range.
   In an apparent bid for stockholder support, Texaco announced the
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset
sales to $5 billion a month later.
   But Icahn, unsatisfied, proceeded with his $60-per-share offer
for those Texaco shares he does not already known, and launched his
threatened proxy fight.

<HEAD>Oil Cartel Expected To Focus on Internal Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers, scheduled to meet Saturday in
Vienna, Austria, are expected to put aside talk of an alliance with
other producing nations and focus instead on their old, familiar
problem of production quotas.
   Six weeks ago, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
failed in an attempt to work out an agreement with six non-cartel
nations for cutting oil output to bolster world oil prices.
   Now, industry analysts say the regular mid-year meeting will
probably have to face up to the issue of controlling its own
production quota system.
   Currently, 12 of the cartel's 13 members are pledged to hold
their output at 15.06 million barrels of crude oil a day. Iraq is
the only member that refused to go along with the pact, which was
extended last December and is due to expire June 30.
   While the quotas were designed to support oil prices at $18 a
barrel, prices have been hovering about $1.50 a barrel below that
level.
   Nonetheless, analysts said they expected OPEC to extend the
current quotas through the second half of the year and focus on
related internal issues.
   These would include persuading Iraq to accept a quota and
defining oil production more strictly to discourage cheating.
   Venezuela is leading one faction that would like to see output
cut at least marginally to get prices up nearer to $18, said Fergus
MacLeod, an analyst with the London investment firm Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   But a group led by Saudi Arabia would like to see a small
increase in quotas to match projections of higher demand in the
rest of the year, he said.
   MacLeod said it would be difficult to see how the two camps
could be reconciled, adding: ``The most likely outcome when they
can't agree is a rollover of the existing agreement.''
   In New York, Paul Mlotok, an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers
Inc., said he did not expect any major changes, saying the meeting
would not be dramatic.
   At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London, Peter Gignoux,
managing director of the international energy department, said he
also expects OPEC to focus on the tangential matters. ``OPEC will
be more introspective,'' he said.
   Iraq does not abide by the quota agreement because it wants a
production quota equal to that of Iran, with which it has been at
war since 1980.
   Iran's quota is 2.369 million barrels a day. Iraq's quota under
a previous agreement was 1.54 million barrels a day, but it is
believed to be producing 2.65 million barrels daily now.
   Some OPEC members have been accused of cheating by classifying
oil as condensate, which is an extremely light crude oil, or as oil
to be used in their own refineries. Neither kind counts against
official quotas.
   Kuwait claims that 2 million barrels of OPEC oil a day are not
being properly counted, Mlotok said. ``It's significant,'' he said.
   At the cartel's earlier special meeting in Vienna, the cartel
made its first major attempt to create a worldwide coalition of oil
producers to boost oil prices.
   The non-OPEC members have not been invited to this week's
meeting, but Mexico might attend unofficially, said Fergus MacLeod,
an analyst with the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Ltd.
   Venezuela, an aggressive promoter of the coalition approach, has
been working to expand the non-OPEC group and has persuaded
Trinidad and Tobago to join it, MacLeod said.
   At the end of the April 28-May 2 gathering, the OPEC ministers
asked a committee of six members _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela,
Nigeria, Kuwait, Algeria, and Indonesia _ to continue negotiations
with non-OPEC nations.
   ``I don't expect an agreement with non-OPEC although I expect
ongoing discussions,'' Mlotok said.
   MacLeod said: ``Most in OPEC want to carry on talking to
non-OPEC countries in the hope that if there isn't an agreement to
cut back now there might be in the spring of next year.''
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, led a minority group in
blocking the proposal to jointly cut production, which was first
put forward by the non-OPEC group.
   The final proposal called for OPEC to cut oil production by
300,000 barrels a day during May and June, when oil prices
traditionally are weak, while the non-OPEC group would cut output
by 5 percent, or 183,000 barrels a day.
   Saudi Arabia argued that OPEC and non-OPEC nations should cut
production by the same amount of barrels a day and that the OPEC
cut should be borne equally by all OPEC members.
   The non-OPEC group consisted of Mexico, Egypt, China, Angola,
Oman and Malaysia. Colombia participated but would not have been
required to cut its output.

<HEAD>Water Shortage Raises Costs Slightly for Chip Makers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer chip makers, as thirsty as
cattlemen and farmers in the deepening drought, say they'll swallow
the rising costs of using millions of gallons of water without
raising prices.
   That could change, however, if the water shortage becomes so
acute that it not only pushes up the costs of obtaining and
treating water but also limits production.
   Extremely pure water, and lots of it, is essential to
semiconductor manufacturing to wash away microscopic debris on the
tiny circuits.
   So far, the water shortage is more an annoyance than a crisis as
companies try to conserve water while making plans for a possible
switch from San Francisco's system to local groundwater.
   The groundwater, hardened by such minerals as iron manganese and
calcium, requires a different purification process, and that change
could cost each company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   ``It sounds like a lot but that's really a minor increase in our
manufacturing costs,'' John Grenagle of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
in Sunnyvale said this week. ``The higher water costs also would be
minimal and wouldn't affect the price of chips.''
   An extra cost, he said, may come from conservation as Advanced
Micro Devices joins other companies in trying to cut back water use
by 25 percent.
   ``One of the ways of making sure you get good chips is to flood
them with a lot of chemicals, which means you're using a lot of
water,'' he said. ``We may decrease the amount (of flooding) we do,
which may increase some of the rejects, which represents a cost.''
   All those costs combined will come out of Advanced Micro
Devices' bottom line and not the customer's wallet, Grenagle said,
``mainly because the price of chips is competition-driven rather
than cost-driven.''
   Smaller chip companies, such as Siliconix Inc. of Santa Clara,
also are loathe to raise prices and will absorb the extra costs.
   ``The drought really hasn't hit us yet, but if we have to spend
$200,000 to $300,000 to handle well water that's a lot to us, a few
cents a share off the profits,'' said Tom Boag, director of plant
and computer services at Siliconix.
   The lawns and flowers around Siliconix may suffer, but the
company says it can't cut back much on the 1.3 million gallons it
uses a month making silicon wafers, transistors and linear
integrated circuits.
   Siliconix is more fortunate than some rivals, though. It bought
equipment last year that cleans its wafers more efficiently, with
the side benefit of using 15 to 20 percent less water.
   ``We feel we're in pretty good shape to meet the city's request
to cut back 25 percent,'' Boag said. ``We can always squeeze out
another 5 percent just by being very careful and turning off sinks
and equipment.''
   The chip companies have not been given mandatory reduction rules
yet, although several cities are considering them.
   ``No one has asked industry to shut down because of the drought,
but they've certainly been asked to conserve as much as they can,''
said Dan Kriege, manager of operations at the Santa Clara Valley
Water District.
   The valley normally uses about 400,000 acre feet of water a
year. Officials want to reduce that to 350,000 acre feet this year.
   If the chip makers are forced to switch to groundwater, Kriege
said, that could threaten the stability of the land.
   ``If we pump out too much water from the groundwater base, then
we're going to have some sites where the ground starts sinking,''
he said.
   ``It has occurred several times in the last 80 years and caused
plenty of damage,'' he added. ``Some places the ground sank 13
feet. We're trying to prevent it from happening again.''

<TEXT>
   Oil prices bounced back but remain within a
range where the market has hovered recently in anticipation of the
OPEC meeting beginning this weekend.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for July delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at
$17.37 per 42-gallon barrel Tuesday, up 11 cents. The contract had
dropped 24 cents on Monday.
   Among July contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled up 0.47 cents at 50.20 cents a gallon, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 46.23 cents a gallon, up 0.39 cent.
   Contracts for refined products also had been off sharply in the
previous session.
   Traders said the rebound was simply a reaction to the earlier
selloff and was not based on any significant news development. The
market has been trading in a relatively narrow range, well below
the official $18 price set for oil produced by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``More than anything, the market continues to have a bearish
attitude (about the upcoming meeting),'' said Richard Redoglia of
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The regular mid-year meeting, which opens Saturday in Vienna,
Austria, is expected to focus on the cartel's production quotas and
price-support mechanisms.

<HEAD>Chrysler Ends Challenge to Emissions Recall of 93,000 1981
Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has agreed to begin recalling and
repairing 93,000 of its 1981-model small cars in August to meet a
1986 Environmental Protection Agency emissions recall order, the
EPA said.
   The federal agency ordered the recall of the Dodge Omni and 024
and the Plymouth Horizon and TC3, all with 1.7-liter engines and
manual transmissions, because tests showed emissions levels
exceeded standards.
   Tests showed emissions levels of 1.4 grams per mile while the
standard for 1981 was 1 gram per mile. The EPA said Tuesday it
believed excess emissions resulted from deteriorating catalytic
converters.
   Chrysler initially chose to contest the order, charging the
tests were not conducted properly. But Chrysler withdrew its
challenge and agreed instead to recall and repair the vehicles.
   The repair will include modifying the vacuum line to the
engine's electronic spark-control computer.
   Chrysler's withdrawal of its challenge was the second since EPA
began recalling vehicles for emissions repairs in 1972.
   In May, General Motors Corp. withdrew a challenge to a 1985
order, and the vehicles involved will be recalled in September, the
EPA said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar posted modest losses against most major
foreign currencies in Europe early today in moderately active
trading. Gold bullion fell.
   Market players sold dollars because of uncertainty over next
week's report on the seasonally adjusted U.S. trade gap for April,
traders said.
   But they said concern that central banks would intervene to
prevent a sudden drop in the dollar was providing a floor for the
currency.
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7139 West German marks, down from 1.7143; 1.4290
Swiss francs, up from 1.4277; 5.7905 French francs, down from
5.7910; 1.9220 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9245; 1,272.95 Italian
lire, down from 1,273.10; and 1.2238 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2318.
   The dollar fell against the British pound, which was quoted at
$1.8220, compared with Tuesday's $1.8130.
   The dollar weakened in Tokyo, closing at 125.32 Japanese yen,
down from 125.77 yen. In London trading later Wednesday, the dollar
slipped to 125.11 yen.
   London's major bullion houses fixed a recommended gold price at
midmorning of $458.75 a troy ounce, down from $463.50 late Tuesday.
A trader said gold fell overnight in reaction to a drop in grain
prices. The metal was boosted last week by a rally in the
commodities market.
   In Zurich, gold traded at a bid of $458.50, down from $463.50.
   Earlier, the metal closed in Hong Kong at a bid of $458.98, down
from $464.03.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $7.20, down from
$7.34.

   The dollar continued its downward swing against the
Japanese yen in trading in Tokyo today, while stock prices declined
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 125.32 yen, down 0.45 yen from Tuesday's
finish, but slightly higher than its opening level of 125.27 yen.
   ``The dollar was stable, trading between 125.15 and 125.35 yen
throughout the day,'' said a foreign exchange dealer at a major
commercial bank.
   The dollar has continued to lose ground in Tokyo since it closed
above the 126-yen mark last Friday for the first time in about two
months.
   Another dealer attributed the dollar's narrow range in part to a
wait-and-see attitude of participants awaiting the release of U.S.
trade figures for April, due out next week.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 28.92 points Tuesday, shed another
54.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to end the day at 27,912.65.
   ``Profit-taking eased the Nikkei index a little, but the market
is maintaining its strength without a sense among investors that it
is overheating,'' said Fumihiko Morimoto of First Boston.
   Other traders said the market had been prepared to take a rest,
and a setback on Wall Street Tuesday gave investors one more
incentive to sit out the day's trading.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 1.8
billion shares, down from 2.2 billion shares Tuesday. Activity
slowed in the afternoon, however, with only 700 million shares
changing hands.
   Declining issues included electricals, automobiles and precision
machineries. Chemicals and non-ferrous metal stocks also moved
lower. Advancers included railways and steels.

Tuesday.

Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial average closed 20.62 points
lower at 2,054.59.
   In addition, a 54.67 point loss Wednesday, to 27,912,65, in the
Nikkei Stock Average in Tokyo did not help matters, traders said.
   ``Wall Street threw a shadow over us at the beginning but we're

   The stock market opened higher today as
investors drew encouragement from a firmer bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.35 points to
2,062.94 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 627 up, 296 down and
478 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 59.07 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said firming bond prices were the overriding factor
that supported stocks on the opening. Recent pressure on bonds,
stemming largely from inflation worries that have increased with a
recent rise in commodity prices, has taken its toll on stock prices.
   ``The market has been conolidating its gains over the past three
days,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, second vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   She noted that the market might ``spend the rest of the week
milling about'' as traders await the government's report Friday on
the Producer Price Index as well as trade figures due out next week.
   Among actively traded blue chip issues, Exxon was up \ at 44{;
Union Carbide was unchanged at 19~; Bankamerica rose \ to 10~; and
General Electric was up \ at 42{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.44 to 150.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .54 at 303.15.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.62 points to
2,054.59.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading, with 657 up, 877 down and 464 unchanged. Big
Board volume came to 168.71 million, against 152.46 million in the
previous session.

   Takeover target Macmillan Inc. today rejected
proposals by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass to acquire the
publishing company for $1.9 billion or to participate in its
planned restructuring.
   In a statement, Macmillan said its board of directors reaffirmed
its belief that its own restructuring plan is in the best interests
of shareholders.
   The plan would split the company in two and pay shareholders a
special dividend of $52.35 a share. The dividend is scheduled to be
paid Friday.
   But in a lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court, Bass, who
owns about 9.1 percent of Macmillan's roughly 26 million
outstanding shares, is seeking a temporary restraining order to
halt the payout.
   Separately on Tuesday, the investment firm Coniston Partners
disclosed it has accumulated a 4.9 percent stake in Macmillan and
filed an affidavit in support of Bass's effort to block the
dividend payout.
   Augustus Oliver, a principal of the aggressive firm, said
Coniston is not acting in concert with Bass and only wants to see
the publishing and information services company sold to the highest
bidder.
   Oliver would not comment on whether Coniston is positioning
itself to engage in a bidding war with Bass.
   ``We're interested in seeing a full auction for the company and
having it sold to the highest bidder,'' he said. Oliver said
Macmillan's value is more in the neighborhood of $85 to $100 a
share, while many analysts have suggested $85 a share might be a
top price.
   ``We believe that Macmillan's restructuring is an inappropriate
response to Bass's bid, and that it's a flagrant abuse of the
board's fiduciary duty,'' Oliver said.
   As an alternative to his $73-a-share cash bid, Bass proposed a
similar restructuring that also would split Macmillan into two
publicly held companies. But his plan would pay shareholders a
$58-a-share dividend.
   Macmillan said its restructuring ``doubly rewards shareholders
by bringing them significant immediate value and the opportunity to
participate in the future of two high-growth, publicly traded
investment opportunities.''
   In addition to the dividend, shareholders would receive for each
Macmillan share a half-share of common stock in Macmillan
Information Co. and $4.50 in principal amount of Macmillan
Information subordinated debentures.
   The company would be split into Macmillan Publishing Co. and
Macmillan Information.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Macmillan
was up 50 cents a share at $76.
   Analysts have said Bass's initial $64-a-share bid, made last
month, as well as Macmillan's restructuring, still left room for a
third party interested in competing for the company.
   This is the first time Coniston has surfaced since its recent,
unsuccessful proxy battle for four seats on the board of Gillette
Co. The partnership typically purchases a large stake in a company
and then pressures management to restructure or take some other
action to boost the price of its stock.
   Coniston successfully used that tactic last year with United
Airline's parent, which spun off its Westin hotels, Hilton
International and Hertz car rental operations as a result.

<HEAD>Unions Say Lifting Of Shuttle Ban No Big Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf with details.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appellate court's decision to lift an
injunction barring Eastern Airlines from selling its Northeast
shuttle operation is not a great setback, attorneys for two of
Eastern's unions agree.
   ``There's no emergency here,'' said James L. Linsey, who
represents the Air Line Pilots Association.
   ``Our view is that it comes down to a very narrow procedural
decision,'' said Joseph Guerrieri Jr., an attorney for the
International Association of Machinists, which filed the suit in
which the injunction was issued.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington Tuesday lifted a
contempt citation issued against Eastern but gave the machinists 10
days to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the airline from
selling the popular shuttle to another subsidiary of its parent
company, Texas Air Corp.
   Even if Eastern ultimately wins, it still must face a lawsuit
brought by the pilots union, which has persuaded another federal
judge to halt the transfer of ``work opportunities'' from Eastern
to other companies.
   Lawyers for both sides agreed to a timetable for proceedings
that will keep the shuttle transaction on hold until the company
gives the court 10 days notice of the closing of the transaction.
That notification would not come until August 26, according to
Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Texas Air.
   In March, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt, ruling on the suit
filed by the Machinists, said Eastern had flouted a July 1987 order
he had issued barring the carrier from transferring 6,000 ground
crew members to another subsidiary by taking steps to sell the
Eastern air shuttle.
   Tuesday, a three-judge panel directed Pratt to conduct further
hearings if the machinists continue their challenge to determine if
an injunction barring the sale is warranted.
   The court found no basis for Pratt to cite Eastern for contempt
of court and held that the proposed $225 million shuttle sale was
not precluded by Pratt's earlier injunction.
   The panel also concluded unanimously that Pratt had made an
incomplete factual finding when issuing a new injunction against
selling the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle.
   The machinists union, which represents 13,000 Eastern employees,
contends Texas Air is trying to break up Eastern's components to
weaken the power of the unions at the financially troubled carrier.
   Charles Bryan, president of Eastern's machinists local, called
the appeals court ruling ``disappointing because it's going to be
more costly, and it will entail more legal fees and litigation. But
we have absolute confidence in our legal postion.''
   Bryan said the appeals court based its dismissal of the
injunction on procedural matters only, and now that the case has
been remanded to Pratt, the temporary restraining order will be
judged on its merits.
   ``It's difficult to comprehend how a judge who has already held
them in contempt will turn around and go and sell it,'' he added at
a Miami news conference.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said, ``We are pleased with the
decision and are studying its implications.''
   The decision is the latest chapter in a series of bitter legal
battles between Eastern and its unions. Texas Air, headed by Frank
Lorenzo, acquired Eastern in 1986. It also operates Continental
Airlines.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade on reports of
some long-overdue rain in western and southern Iowa.
   Des Moines received nearly 1.8 inches of rain overnight, which
helped drought-stressed crops there. But the showers were spotty
and weather forecasts called for a return to unseasonably warm, dry
conditions.
   ``I don't think the drought's back is broken,'' said Richard
Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Rain was falling in west-central Illinois this morning and light
rains also were expected in Missouri and the Mississippi Delta
region. But most of the Grain Belt was expected to remain dry, and
a return to hot temperatures was forecast for the weekend.
   Grain and soybean futures prices have skyrocketed to four-year
highs in reaction to the dryness in the Midwest, making traders
edgy about even minor changes in the weather picture, Loewy said.
   ``At these price levels, everyone's going to be extremely
nervous,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.73{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents
to 4 cents lower with July at $2.53} a bushel; oats were { cent to
2 cents lower with July at $2.21 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to
10\ cents lower with July at $8.73 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .50 cent lower with June at 73.10
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .25 cent higher with
August at 76 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .72 cent lower
with June at 52.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.25
cents lower to .13 cent higher with July at 55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed Tuesday.

   It may look more like a coffee klatch
than researchers hard at work on a new product, but that's the
whole idea.
   The concept of group decision-making triggered by spontaneous
encounters is shaping the design of a $75 million research and
development center being built at Steelcase Inc., the world's
leading designer and manufacturer of office furniture.
   Not only does the new seven-story, pyramid-shaped building
represent a shift in Steelcase's own corporate culture; the company
also hopes to market the concept of group creativeness to its
customers.
   ``Buying new furniture and computers won't get people to be more
productive,'' company spokesman Peter Jeff said. ``Customers are
coming to us with a larger agenda. They want to understand how they
can work better and how their people can work better.
   ``But before we can be the office environment company for anyone
else, we have to be it for ourselves.''
   Though teamwork and spontaneous meetings are nothing new, it's
unusual for a company of Steelcase's size to tinker with success.
The 76-year-old company had about $1.5 billion in sales last year.
It controls about a quarter of the office furniture market,
according to Annasses it on to the next person,'' Veneklasen said.
   ``We're taking the rugby team approach. The designers, the
engineers, the manufacturing people, the marketing people and the
corporate communications people will ... pass the ball back and
forth, but all going in the same direction at the same time.''
   The 573,000-foot building will feature state-of-the-art
laboratories for perfecting the office environment, including
research on office acoustics, lighting and temperature control.
   Steelcase has said the center will serve as a springboard for
its future plans: to add 8,000 employees to its worldwide work
force of 17,500 by the turn of the century.
   It sees the consulting service as a natural extension of its
existing business, where single chairs carry price tags of up to
$900 and big orders for major companies can run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars. Jeff says Steelcase plans no extra charge
to customers for its logistical advice.
   Indeed, such consulting is fast becoming a popular addition to
the industry's sales pitch.
   ``It's not just a question of putting in a desk and a couple of
file cabinets anymore,'' said Simon De Groot, communications
director for National Office Products Association in Alexandria,
Va. ``The aim now is to create an environment that allows office
workers to take full advantage of new technology and be as
productive as possible.''
   But when it comes to advising clients, is Steelcase's open style
for everyone? Some researchers say the concept of group
creativeness, at the heart of Japanese industry, may not work in a
society where individualism is king.
   ``It's like changing somebody's religion,'' said William K.
Redmon, an assistant professor at Western Michigan who has been
studying how well U.S. companies are adjusting to Japanese work
practices.
   Even for Steelcase, the team approach may make some managers
uncomfortable.
   ``It's going to take time for everybody to get used to it,''
admitted Veneklasen.

<HEAD>CFTC Accuses Refco, Paragon Of Trading Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has
accused Refco Inc., one of the world's largest trading firms, of 11
commodities law violations.
   In addition to Chicago-based Refco, the federal regulatory
agency's administrative complaint named nine individuals and the
Paragon Futures Association, a defunct company whose trades were
guaranteed by Refco.
   Woodstock, Ill.-based Paragon and four individuals settled the
administrative charges Tuesday without admitting wrongdoing. The
charges against Refco and five other people will go to a formal
hearing.
   The CFTC's complaint alleges that in 1985 the firms and
individuals made unauthorized trades in customers' accounts, failed
to supervise employees and violated record-keeping and disclosure
rules.
   The most serious charge is ``churning,'' which means trading a
customer's account often _ and often unprofitably _ just to
generate commissions for brokers.
   Refco said 12 of Paragon's customers were affected by the
alleged churning.
   Most of the charges involved Paragon and its employees, the CFTC
said. Paragon closed shop in July 1985 after customer complaints of
churning.
   Refco said it refused to settle the charges with the CFTC
because it should not be punished for the wrongdoing of another
firm. Refco also said it ``terminated'' Paragon after hearing
complaints of churning.

<TEXT>
   The Senate scheduled final congressional
approval late Wednesday on a catastrophic health insurance bill
that provides additional financial protection for 29 million
elderly Americans on Medicare.
   The House adopted a conference committee compromise by a 328-72
vote last week and similarly overwhelming Senate approval was
assured.
   With the major debate behind and dozens of compromises long
since reached, the Senate scheduled only 45 minutes for the formal,
finishing touch that was set to send the measure to the White House
for President Reagan's expected signature.
   Although there has been no formal word from the White House,
Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen has said he will
ask the president to sign the measure.
   The major portion of the bill, the first significant expansion
of Medicare since the program was born 23 years ago, takes effect
next Jan. 1.
   However, some parts _ such as the first-ever general
prescription drug benefit under Medicare _ are to be phased in over
four years.
   In addition to the historic nature of the benefit expansion, the
bill has particular significance in the way it is financed.
   The beneficaries are expected to pay all of of the additional
costs. On top of a flat monthly premium to be assessed on every
Medicare beneficiary _ $4.00 a month to start _ the estimated 40
percent of the elderly with enough income to be liable for federal
income taxes will be charged a supplemental premium based on their
ability to pay.
   In general, an individual would have to have an annual income of
more than $10,000 before being subject to the additional premium,
which amounts to a tax surcharge.
   Although expanded considerably as it worked its way through
Congress, the final bill is based on a proposal put forth more than
a year ago by Reagan at the urging of Bowen.
   It provides full hospital coverage after a once-a-year
deductible estimated at $564 in 1989 and indexed to hospital
inflation. Medicare now pays full charges for no more than 59 days
a year and the recipient is subject to a deductible for each
hospitalization.
   The cap on costs for physicians is $1,370 a year. After a $75
deductible, Medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills
and that part of the program remains intact. Starting in 1989,
however, the $75 deductible and the 20 percent share paid by
beneficiaries counts toward the $1,370 cap. After that is reached,
Medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor bills.
   However, the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of
doctor bills that exceed the fees approved by Medicare.
   In a new benefit, Medicare will pay half of outpatient
prescription drug costs in 1991 after a $600 deductible is met. The
government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in
1993. However, the deductible is expected to rise each year to keep
pace with rising drug costs.
   Medicare now does not cover outpatient drugs except for a
handful of very expensive ones such as anti-rejection medication
for organ transplant recipients.
   The so-called supplemental premium starts at $22.50 a year for
each $150 of income tax owed in 1989, climbing to an additional $42
a year on each $150 of tax liability by 1993. There is an $800 cap
on the supplemental premium in 1989, climbing to $1,050 in 1993.

   Share prices moved higher Wednesday as early
nervousness was overcome in the last hour of trading by a stronger
showing on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 8
points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 1,828.2, its highest level for
the session.
   The day's low was 6.9 points down, which came in the first hour
of trading.
   Trading volume was a modest 391.8 million shares, compared with
Tuesday's 557.4 million issues.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 22.21
points at 2,076.80 at the close of London trading.
   Dealers said the positive showing on Wall Street helped buoy
sentiment.
   The market ``behaved very well and we're seeing evidence of
institutional buying once again,'' said Anthony Abrahams, managing
director of U.K. equities at Smith New Court in London.
   Charles Larkham, an equity strategist at James Capel and Co.,
said the 100-share index, by remaining firmly above the 1,800
level, was ``building a base from which it can hopefully make a
more determined leap higher in the not-too-distant future.
   ``It's been a quiet day but the flavor is optimistic,'' Larkham
said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 10.1 points to 1,455.2.
   The Financial Times 500-share index gained 4.38 points to close
at 1,030.93.

<HEAD>Hawaiian Company Agrees To Buy Knoxville Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hawaiian company has agreed to buy the
Knoxville Journal, one of the city's two daily newspapers, it was
reported Wednesday.
   Persis Corp., parent company of the Honolulu Advertiser, has
agreed in principle to buy the afternoon newspaper from
McKinney-McMahan Newspapers Inc., the Journal said. The purchase is
expected to close the first of August, the newspaper said. The
price was not disclosed.
   ``The Persis group is a quality news organization that will be a
great asset to Knoxville,'' said Ron McMahan, who is publisher and
editor of the Journal.``They have the financial resources to take
an outstanding newspaper and make it even greater.''
   Bill McKinney, who is publisher and general manager of the
44,000-circulation newspaper, said the purchase was arranged
because ``Ron and I have chosen to go in different directions in
our lives.''
   Persis Corp., based in Honolulu, also owns Northwest Media Inc.
and publishes the Journal-American in Bellevue, Wash., and the
Peninsula Daily News in Port Angeles as well as several weeklies in
the Northwest.
   The Honolulu Advertiser, with a circulation of 95,000, is the
largest newspaper in the Persis group.
   Two years ago McKinney and McMahan bought the Journal from
Gannett Co. for about $25 million. The same year the Journal and
the Knoxville News-Sentinel, currently the city's morning paper,
switched publishing cycles. The News-Sentinel is owned by the
Cincinnati-based Scripps-Howard chain.
   Under a joint operating agreement the Journal is printed and
circulated by the Knoxville News-Sentinel Co.
   In 1981 Gannett purchased majority interest in the newspaper
from the Roy N. Lotspeich family.

<TEXT>
   House power brokers squared off Wednesday in a
showdown over a $28 billion long-term home health care program that
bypassed committee scrutiny and, under a special deal, went
straight to the floor.
   The ``Long-Term Home Health Care Act'' sponsored by Reps. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla., and Edward Roybal, D-Calif., would expand Medicare
to cover long-term home services to the disabled and chronically
ill of all ages. An estimated 2.2 million people would qualify in
1990.
   Reps. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, and John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, headed a drive to block
consideration of the Pepper bill. They were irked that the measure
did not go through their committees.
   The bill stirred controversy from the moment the 87-year-old
Pepper, a well-known advocate for the elderly, said he wanted to
attach it to another Medicare expansion bill _ the catastrophic
health initiative scheduled for final passage Wednesday in the
Senate.
   House leaders feared the weight of Pepper's plan would sink the
catastrophic bill, which is designed to cushion the financial blow
of acute illness among the elderly. So Pepper agreed to withhold
his measure _ in exchange for an assurance from House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, that there would be a separate floor vote on
Pepper's proposal.
   As the vote to consider the bill neared, Republicans and
Democrats alike contended that House rules were being manipulated
and members were being needlessly forced to vote on a popular but
unexamined bill five months before an election.
   The deliberate legislative process ``serves us well and
ultimately, saves us all from chaos,'' Rostenkowski said in a May
31 letter to Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, appealing for his help in defeating the
Pepper initiative.
   ``I cannot remember a more serious violation of the House
rules,'' Dingell said in a May 23 letter to all members of the
House. Furthermore, Dingell wrote, the bill ``does not pay for
nursing home costs, which are the major sources of financially
devastating costs for the elderly.''
   Pepper said he didn't include nursing home benefits because he
wanted to keep the cost of his bill down. The sponsor of the
companion Senate bill, Paul Simon, D-Ill., said 30 percent of
people in nursing homes would not be there if home services were
available.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Pepper program
would cost $28 billion over five years. It would be paid for by
taxing income above $45,000 a year, which is now exempt from the
Medicare payroll tax.
   CBO said the program would begin running a deficit after the
fifth year. Under the bill, benefits would be cut and beneficiaries
charged a co-payment to offset any shortfalls.
   Some House members told Pepper they feared passage of his bill
would undermine chances for developing a more comprehensive
program, including nursing home and home health care, next year.
Others said the program promised more than it could deliver,
because the agencies and services it required did not yet exist.
   The Reagan administration opposed the Pepper bill and advisers
to President Reagan said they would recommend a veto if it reached
his desk.
   In a recent letter to House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said
two-thirds of the people who would qualify for home care services
under the Pepper bill now receive informal care from family and
friends.
   Based on administration calculations, Bowen predicted the
program would rack up a $9 billion deficit in 1990 and $26 billion
by 2000. He said that would put a heavy burden on beneficiaries who
would have to make up half the deficit through co-payments.
   Among those fighting the Pepper bill was the Coordinating
Committee for Long-Term Care Policy, a coalition of insurance and
business groups that includes the American Council of Life
Insurance and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in European trading Wednesday, but lost ground against the British
pound. Gold closed lower in dull trading.
   Dealers said uncertainties about upcoming U.S. trade figures for
April, scheduled to be released Tuesday, kept the dollar in a tight
range for most of the session.
   ``The market will continue to be nervous at least until next
week's trade figures,'' said one Frankfurt trade
   The dollar fell against the pound in London late Wednesday. At
the market's closing, it cost $1.8175 to buy one pound, more
expensive than $1.8130 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.45 yen to a closing 125.32 yen from Tuesday's
125.77. Later, in London, it was quoted at a slightly lower rate of
125.23 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.7183 West German marks, up from 1.7143; 1.4350 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4277; 5.7923 French francs, up from 5.7910; 1.9250 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9245; 1,273.50 Italian lire, up from 1,273.10;
and 1.2220 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2318.
   Gold fell in Europe Wednesday, following Tuesday's drop in New
York.
   ``The price drop happened in New York and we're discovering that
Europe isn't strong enough to make much movement on its own,'' said
a bullion dealer in Zurich.
   Gold's late bid price in London was $458.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $463.50. In Zurich, gold was also
lower, closing at a bid $458.50 compared with $463.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.05 to close at a bid $458.98.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $7.15 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $7.34.

<HEAD>News International To Launch New European Satellite TV Channels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News International PLC, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's
Australian-based News Corp., announced Wednesday a major expansion
of its European satellite television interests.
   The company said it would launch two, or perhaps three, new
channels early next year to supplement one currently in operation.
   An English-language all-news channel and a feature film channel
are expected to be launched in February 1989, joining News
International's existing general entertainment channel, Murdoch
told a news conference.
   The three channels, collectively known as Sky Television, will
operate 24 hours a day and will be funded from advertising revenue,
Murdoch said.
   Murdoch said he has signed a 10-year lease to rent from British
Telecommunications PLC three of 16 transponders available on an
Astra satellite, due to be launched in November by Societe
Europeenne des Satellites.
   News International also holds an option on a fourth transponder.
   The film channel initially will be available only in Britain,
while the other channels will be distributed in continental Europe
as well.
   Murdoch said he also expects the launch of a multilingual
all-sports channel, known as Eurosport, being set up jointly with
the European Broadcasting Union.
   Murdoch wouldn't provide details of how much News International
was investing in the expansion.
   Also attending the news conference was Alan Sugar, chairman of
Amstrad PLC, a U.K. computer manufacturer, who announced plans to
produce a cheap satellite dish designed to receive the new Murdoch
channels.
   Sugar said he expects to market the new dish in the first
quarter of 1989 at a basic retail price of 199 pounds ($362
dollars) each. Satellite television dishes currently sell in
Britain for at least 1,000 pounds ($1,820, Sugar said.
   Sky Television, which will be based in London, and Eurosport
also will be available through existing cable television hookups.
   Competitors for the European satellite television market include
British Satellite Broadcasting and a consortium including Maxwell
Communication Corp.

<HEAD>Aging Planes Cause Airline Industry To Weigh Replacement</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A terrifying accident involving a Boeing 737
airplane has stunned the nation's airline industry and challenged
one of its bedrock tenets. A 19-year-old 737 operated by Aloha
Airlines disintegrated during a flight over Hawaii on April 28,
sweeping a flight attendant to her death and injuring 61
passengers. The pilots managed to land the plane safely.
   The incident galvanized the industry and brought more than 350
representatives from airlines, aircraft manufacturers, government
agencies and aviation safety groups to Washington early this month
for a special conference, where the safety of older planes was
hotly debated.
   The Aloha disaster also focused attention on a long-standing,
fundamental rule of the industry: Aging planes have always been
replaced on the basis of economic factors, not safety
considerations.
   Lower fuel prices in recent years, for example, have led
airlines to hang onto older jetliners, since they didn't have to be
replaced by more fuel-efficient aircraft.
   The average age of U.S. jetliners is 12.53 years, up a sharp 21
percent from 1979, a year when oil shortages brought spiraling fuel
prices. More than half the 2,767 jets operated by major U.S.
carriers are 16 years old or older, according to Avmark Inc., an
aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va.
   ``If (planes) are properly maintained, we can fly them for an
indefinite period,'' said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United
Airlines. ``It's really an economic decision as far as when you
retire an airplane.''
   Industry observers say recent orders for new aircraft provide
pointed examples of the ``economic life'' rule:
   _United, the nation's largest carrier, recently placed an order
with Boeing Co. for 60 new 757s.
   _No. 2 American Airlines ordered another 100 757s from Boeing,
to replace its fleet of 33 737s acquired in its 1987 takeover of
AirCal Inc., as well as some of its own 727s.
   The average age of the planes in United's existing fleet is 13.6
years, while American's aircraft average 10.0 years. The new orders
will bring United's average down to 11.6 by the end of this year,
and American's will fall to 9.4.
   The purchases were huge even by jetliner order standards,
costing United and American together more than $4 billion.
   The airlines say the purchases were under study long before the
Aloha accident and were based on such factors as reduced operating
and maintenance costs. But in the wake of the 737 mishap, the
pressure to update the nation's commercial fleet grows ever
stronger.
   Robert Goodrich, a top official of the Federal Aviation
Administration, said at the Washington conference that the agency
will make a thorough review of inspection and maintenance programs
for aging jetliners. The agency said additional testing techniques
would be developed to determine the lifespan of a jetliner.
   Several members of Congress also have sounded the alarm. Rep.
Dan Glickman, D-Kan., for example, suggested that the FAA buy old
planes and test them to determine when an aircraft no longer can be
considered safe.
   Under the spotlight of such scrutiny, the safety issue may begin
to color the economics of fleet replacement. As the costs of
maintaining and insuring older planes surge, and litigation by
accident victims and their families mushrooms, airlines may be
forced to retire their aging craft sooner than anticipated.
   ``When the economics of it demands a change, (the airlines) will
change,'' said Wendell Gauthier, a New Orleans attorney who has
represented plane crash victims.
   The U.S. commercial airline industry paid a total of $373
million in insurance premiums in 1986, up sharply from $272 million
in 1985, according to the Air Transport Association, a
Washington-based trade group. Figures for premiums paid on older
planes aren't available.
   Of the 1986 total, the carriers paid $170 million in hull
insurance, covering damage to aircraft, $158 million for passenger
liability and $45 million for cargo insurance and other charges.
   Payments to accident victims and their survivors by airlines and
aircraft manufacturers are also on the rise. Some insurance
underwriters estimate that U.S. carriers face potential liability
of $1.25 million per seat on planes involved in crashes, according
to the National Law Journal, a weekly newspaper published in New
York.
   The airlines insist that they are sticking to their traditional
economic rules for putting old planes out to pasture.
   ``The basic feeling toward operating old craft has not
changed,'' said Pan Am Corp. spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   ``Certainly, we have an open mind,'' United's Hopkins said. But
he insisted that the airline hasn't changed its policy of
replacement decisions based on economics.
   If the airlines do move to buy new aircraft, they would trim
their operating costs by burning less fuel and cutting maintenance
expenses. In addition, new models like the 757 need only two pilots
in the cockpit instead of the three in many older planes.
   The costs of buying new jetliners can be daunting, though _
especially for some U.S. carriers that are financially strapped,
plagued by labor troubles and easy prey to be taken over by
investors or competitors.
   Edward Starkman, an industry analyst for investment firm
PaineWebber Inc., suggested that airlines might begin to operate
their aging jets fewer hours each day. The carriers also are likely
to continue to emphasize maintenance and inspection of the older
planes, he said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' pilots union says Transportation
Secretary James Burnley ``glossed over'' significant problems when
he talked with reporters last week about a federal report on the
company's safety practices.
   In the report, the Federal Aviation Administration said its
month-long investigation determined that Eastern was fit to fly.
   ``Our preliminary analysis of the ... report shows that the FAA
found significant problems at Eastern which had been identified by
Eastern pilots previous to the investigation, but which were either
glossed over, ignored or buried by Mr. Burnley when he gave his
interpretation of the report,'' the Air Line Pilots Association
said Tuesday in a statement.
   ``We strenuously object to (the) characterization of the report
presented by Mr. Burnley at his press conference,'' the ALPA said.
``Anyone who takes the trouble to read the full DOT report will
discover that the issues of concern are a far cry from those
described by Mr. Burnley.''
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Wednesday the safety
problems alleged by the union are the same type that led to the
federal investigation.
   ``The FAA has thoroughly examined Eastern,'' she said. ``The FAA
and DOT find Eastern to be safe and we're satisfied and pleased
with that report.
   ``These allegations are completely without merit.''
   In support of its statement, the ALPA cited specific safety
deficiencies noted in the report. Among those listed by the union:
   _Unairworthy aircraft were flown in 1987.
   _The maintenance budget is unproductively spent.
   _Eastern's on-time performance overrides maintenance
considerations.
   _On average, the dispatch system handles three times as many
flights as is normal for such airlines.
   _The weather department was dismantled, resulting in inadequate
weather information to pilots.
   However, the union reiterated that Eastern is safe ``because of
the professionalism of its pilots.''

   Most grain and soybean futures closed sharply
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as isolated showers
brought relief to parched cropland in parts of the Midwest.
   But oat futures advanced strongly because the rain missed the
northern tier of states, which produce most of the country's oat
crop, analysts said.
   Soybean futures, which have climbed to four-year highs on fears
of drought damage, posted their steepest decline in two weeks as
bands of showers moved from Iowa into Illinois and Missouri.
   But nobody was declaring an end to the dry weather or to the
bull market for grains and soybeans.
   ``The overall drought-type conditions still appear to be
intact,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``This market has had explosive price action in response to
drought conditions,'' he said. ``Whenever you get into a situation
like that, the first sign of any potential relief brings a lot of
reaction from the market with a lot of profit-taking.''
   At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 10 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.70{ a bushel; corn was 7{ cents
to 9\ cents lower with July at $2.48 a bushel; oats were 7 cents to
12{ cents higher with July at $2.34 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents

<TEXT>
   France will forgive a third of its loans to the
world's poorest nations and is urging other big industrial powers
to take similar action, the president's office said Wednesday.
   The plan would not apply to the world's most indebted developing
nations, such as Brazil and Mexico, because they are not among the
poorest, although France believes ways also must be found to help
them, a spokesman said.
   The spokesman declined to put a value on the forgiven debts.
   In a related development, West Germany announced Wednesday that
it would forgive about $50 million in debts owed by five African
nations.
   French President Francois Mitterrand set out his proposal in a
letter sent Monday to the six other leaders attending the economic
summit June 19-21, special counselor Jacques Attali told reporters.
   ``It has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help
the countries of the Third World, while the gap between rich
countries and poor countries continues to grow,'' Mitterrand wrote,
according to excerpts made public by his office.
   Mitterrand, President Reagan and the leaders of Canada, Britain,
West Germany, Italy and Japan are planning to attend the annual
three-day meeting in Toronto.
   In Bonn, West Germany, a government source said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl also planned to present summit participants with a
proposal for reducing the debt burden of the poorest nations.
   France is proposing that the seven nations agree to take one of
three approaches:
   _Forgive one-third of the total public or government-guaranteed
commercial debt, with the rest consolidated at normal market terms.
   _Consolidate existing debt at market rates of interest, but
extend repayments over 25 years rather than the current norm of 20
years.
   _Consolidate the debt at a preferential interest rate of no more
than half the market rate, but with repayments over about 15 years.
   ``It's a very new procedure,'' Attali said. ``With its menu of
options, it gives us reason to hope for a consensus.''
   Whether or not the summit partners agree, France intends to go
ahead with the first option, wiping out one-third of the debt,
Attali said.
   He refused to specify how much money was involved, beyond saying
the amount is ``not just in the hundreds of millions of francs.''
At current exchange rates, 100 million francs is about $17.2
million.
   Attali declined to identify the countries that would be
eligible, saying only that they numbered about 20. To qualify, a
nation must be extremely poor, deeply in debt and in the process of
improving the management of its economy, he said.
   In Bonn, the government's chief spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, told
reporters that West Germany had forgiven debts totaling 86 million
marks, or about $50.5 million, owed by the Central African
Republic, Togo, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Sudan.
   Ost said the govenment was considering the possibility of
extending partial debt forgiveness to other poor countries.

   Fear not, all you who have botched a batch
of laundry with an overdose of bleach. Now, a little dash can
breathe new life into your wardrobe.
   A Texas clothing company is marketing a line of apparel that can
change color with controlled amounts of liquid bleach and cold
water.
   That might not sound so new _ after all, just about any fabric
will fade when it is bleached. But with the Colormagic process,
cloth changes from teal blue to peach, from royal blue to hot pink,
or from violet to orange, among other combinations.
   ``I think (the possibilities) are unlimited,'' said Tom Ahmann,
executive vice president of El Paso-based Greater Texas Finishing
Corp., which dyes and markets the line of clothes. ``It's so
different from what's been offered before.''
   If Colormagic takes off, it would mark the second time that
Greater Texas caught the beginning of a clothing fad. The
corporation was one of the first to offer acid-washing for
companies that make denim clothing.
   The Colormagic process was invented by Owen Sercus, a textile
chemist at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, and
Greater Texas is the sole manufacturer.
   There are two basic ways to change the color of the garments.
First, the color of the entire garment can be changed by tossing it
in a cold-water wash cycle with a specific amount of liquid bleach.
Colors usually can be changed twice; for example, from hot pink to
apricot to cantaloupe.
   The color-changing can even be done in the same wash with other
clothes because the dye dissolves and is not absorbed by other
clothes in the washer, Greater Texas officials say.
   The garments _ which now are made only in girls' and junior
sizes _ also can become canvases for people who want to personalize
their own clothes. In a process that could be likened to reverse
tie-dyeing, people can use paint brushes or cotton swabs to brush
or draw designs onto the fabric with diluted liquid bleach.
   After the designs are drawn, the garment is dried thoroughly,
then washed in cold water to remove the bleach. The designs are the
color of the underlying fabric.
   Ahmann said Wednesday he thinks the clothes will be a hit
``because consumers are looking for more and more individuality in
their clothes. With something like this, they can get it.''
   The Colormagic line consists of jean jackets, hats, socks,
jeans, T-shirts, belts, walking shorts and camp shirts and is
available at five stores nationwide: Bloomingdale's in New York,
Marshall-Field's in Chicago, Macy's in San Francisco, Highbee's in
Cleveland and The Popular in El Paso.
   Ahmann said the line will be expanded later to adult sizes and
might be offered in more stores once manufacturing capacity
increases. The clothes are not cheap: jeans cost $48, T-shirts are
$19 and socks are $10 a pair.

   U.S. monetary authorities cut back their
purchases of dollars to $818 million in the February-April period
as the stability of the U.S. currency lessened the need for
intervention, according to a report Wednesday.
   The dollar purchases, carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, were down from the $4.14 billion purchased in the
previous three-month period.
   During the three months covered by the report, the dollar fell
1.5 percent against the currencies of other major industrialized
nations, weighted by the amount of trade conducted with each, the
New York Fed said.
   The dollar purchases are carried out on behalf of the Federal
Reserve and the U.S. Treasury.
   The New York Fed said it bought $318 million with Japanese yen
on March 25, 28 and 29 in coordination with dollar purchases by the
Bank of Japan.
   The U.S. authorities bought $240 million with West German marks
and $260 million with yen on April 14 and 15. Those purchases
followed the April 14 announcement of a widening of the U.S. trade
deficit in February and were coordinated with other central banks,
the New York Fed said.
   The New York Fed does not comment on its current
foreign-exchange operations.

   The Senate bowed to President Reagan on
Wednesday and sustained his veto of a massive trade bill, but
supporters executed a last-minute maneuver designed to keep the
measure alive.
   The vote was 61-37, with 10 Republicans abandoning the White
House and supporting override of the measure, which would overhaul
procedures under which the government imposes import curbs to
assist U.S. industries and retaliate against international trade
violations.
   Just two Democrats voted to sustain Reagan's second veto of a
major trade bill in three years.
   ``This controversy with the president is not about trade, it is
not even about economics. It is about politics,'' Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, R-N.M., told the Senate. He hailed burgeoning U.S.
exports and improved trade figures.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a
co-sponsor, said, however, ``They'll be rejoicing in Japan, they'll
be popping champagne corks in Germany'' as a result of the action.
   The vote was five short of the two-thirds majority needed to
override the veto by Reagan, who had objected to the provisions in
the bill that included plant closings notification and restrictions
on Alaskan oil exports.
   Republican critics of the defeated measure blasted its
special-interest provisions and said protectionist provisions had
not been fully removed.
   But supporters in both parties said the 1,000-page bill was
vitally needed by farmers and heavy industries feeling harsh trade
pressures.
   The Senate's action was accompanied by renewed calls for a more
moderate version that Reagan could sign before the November
election.
   Sen. Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., raised the
possibility, however, that such a stripped-down trade measure might
become hopelessly entangled in the Senate's complex procedures. He
said that would force a choice between the bill Reagan vetoed or no
bill.
   Byrd voted against the measure in a parliamentary move that
would allow him to bring the bill back again. He said he hoped
constituents would pressure their senators to revive the measure
before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaign.
   He said his parliamentary ploy was ``insurance that the American
people can still get a trade bill this year.''
   Reagan issued a statement saying he was pleased by the vote.
   ``As I said in my veto message on the bill, I am committed to
enactment of a responsible trade bill this year,'' the president
said. ``I am directing my senior advisors to stand ready to assist
the congressional leadership on a new trade bill _ one that will
strengthen America's international competitiveness and create even
more new jobs for Americans.''
   There also were pointed reminders from both Republican and
Democratic lawmakers that Reagan's supporters on the issue could
come under political attack for opposing the bill, with its
provision to require notice to employees of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   ``We may lose the battle, but we've won the war on this issue,''
Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said. ``This is no longer an issue
between the Congress and the White House. It is now a presidential
campaign issue. Governor (Michael) Dukakis stands by working men
and women who deserve notice of plant closings.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., conceded there were no
assurances that a revised bill could win approval this year. He did
say it ``can be done if the leaders in the Senate and the leaders
in the House will agree with the administration and then agree to
no more amendments.''
   Dole told the Senate the bill should get a more critical look
because ``it fails the truth in advertising test.''
   Far from being devoted to opening global markets for American
goods, Dole said, the measure represents ``a grabbag of provisions
of questionable merit.'' He cited measures to allow in duty-free
ethanol and aid major banks stuck with billions of dollars in Third
World debt.
   Supporters of the measure continued to view a provision calling
for advance notice of plant closings as their most powerful
political weapon.
   ``If you support the president, you will be turning your back on
American workers when they are most in need,'' said Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``You'll be siding with high-priced corporate
lobbyists and fat-cat business executives who are protected by
golden parachutes.''
   The 1,000-page document produced by a House-Senate conference
committee won 63-36 Senate approval on April 27.
   Reagan vetoed the measure May 24, focusing his criticism on the
plant-closings provision, which would require companies with 100
employees or more to provide them with 60-day notice of closings
and large-scale layoffs. Reagan said it would rob managers of the
flexibility needed to keep their businesses in peak economic health.
   Reagan also was critical of an array of other provisions,
including what he described as overly stringent restrictions on
Alaskan oil exports.
   But the House quickly overrode his veto, 308-113. That left it
up to the Senate whether to enact the bill over the president's
veto.
   The bill also would have boosted by $1 billion payments to grain
companies to export U.S. crops and furnish both farmers and the
advertising industry with additional subsidies to stimulate
overseas sales of American agricultural commodities. The windfall
profits tax on oil companies would be repealed under the measure.
   The measure also would make it more difficult for prosecutors to
convict U.S. business executives of complicity in payoffs to
foreign officials. ``That's why I call it the bring-back-bribery
bill,'' said retiring Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., its lone
Democratic critic.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was sharply critical of restrictions
on Alaskan oil exports. One would permit shipment to Canada of
50,000 barrels of crude daily but require that the petroleum be
taken first to a port in the lower 48 states. The other would limit
export of products from new refineries to 70,000 barrels a day and
half of output.

<HEAD>New, Inexpensive Voice-Activated Device for Quadriplegics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inexpensive voice-activated device to enable
the severely handicapped to control their home environments was
unveiled Wednesday by Quartet Technology Inc.
   The Simplicity Series 5, a voice-computer device, was introduced
at a news conference by the Tyngsboro, Mass.-based company.
   The Series 5 is a simple, almost flat device that looks like a
humidifier. With just a few key words, the machine can perform a
number of tasks, including turning lights off and on and turning
appliances on, dialing the phone and answering the phone.
   The device can also control television sets and electric beds
and be used in conjunction with accessories like page turners and
drapery and door openers.
   Michael Rourke, a spokesman for Quartet, said the device is not
the first voice-activated machine to help the severely disabled but
is by far the simplest and least expensive on the market.
   When available in the next month or so, the Series 5 will retail
for $2,490. Quartet officials claim that similar devices on the
market sell for about $12,000.
   Sue Haider, 41, who is now quadriplegic after a shooting
accident in February, has worked with the device for the last two
months. She said using it in her home will mean greatly increased
independence and less need for around-the-clock attendants.
   ``I love it, I really do,'' said Haider. ``You get a sense of
someone being there with you. It means I won't need 24-hour
attendants.''

<HEAD>Murray Ohio Says It is Looking at Alternatives to Electrolux Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. is
discussing the possibility of selling the company to parties other
than AB Electrolux of Sweden, which has offered to buy it,
President John L. Duncan said Wednesday.
   The option is one of many being discussed by Murray Ohio in
light of the Swedish appliance manufacturer's unsolicited $197
million offer for Murray Ohio, Duncan said.
   On Tuesday, Murray Ohio said its directors rejected as
inadequate a $52-a-share tender offer from AB Electrolux and
recommended that the company's shareholders refrain from tendering
their shares.
   ``The board has authorized us to explore a lot of options other
than Electrolux's offer,'' Duncan said Wednesday.
   ``We are talking to third parties about buying Murray Ohio and
other options'' including a recapitalization, he said.
   But Duncan said the discussions do not mean that a decision has
been made to sell the Brentwood-based company, which makes lawn
mowers and bicycles at a plant in Lawrenceburg. He gave no details
of the discussions.
   The Swedish company said it was disappointed with the board's
decision, but said it would pursue its offer, which was launched
May 24.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Murray Ohio rose
$1.37{ a share to $63.87{ on Wednesday.
   AB Electrolux is not connected to Electrolux Inc. of Marietta,
Ga., which makes vacuum cleaners.

<TEXT>
   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil
producer, last month trimmed the average price of its light Isthmus
crude to U.S. clients, the government oil monopoly said Wednesday
night.
   Pemex said in a statement that it charged U.S. customers an
average of $15.78 for a 42-gallon barrel in May, down from the $16
of April.
   The average price of heavy Maya oil rose from $12.77 a barrel in
April to $13.07 in May, the statement said.
   ``The Isthmus- and Maya-quality crudes that Mexico exported
during the month of May to the American continent had a light
variation in their quotations, with respect to April, due to the
linkage of the prices of Mexican oil with the prevailing ones in
the international market,'' Pemex said.
   Prices for Japanese buyers were held steady in May at $15.30 a
barrel for the light oil and $12.60 a barrel for the heavy brand.
   European customers paid less last month. Pemex said those
clients were charged on average $14.99 a barrel for Isthmus crude
during the first 15 days of May and $12.15 for the Maya quality. In
April, the average cost for Europe was $15.43 a barrel for Isthmus
and $12.51 for Maya.
   Pemex said Mexico exported an average of 1.357 million barrels a
day in May, with U.S. buyers taking 51 percent of the total.
   Spain bought 21 percent of the total, and Japan was the third
largest buyer, with a 15 percent share.
   Mexico is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, a 13-member cartel, but it monitors its
decisions closely and often follows its guidelines on pricing and
production.
   OPEC members are scheduled to hold their regular mid-year
meeting in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday. They are expected to focus
their attention on whether to overhaul production quotas.
   Mexico and five other non-cartel nations earlier this year held
talks with OPEC about reducing output in an effort to bolster
sagging world prices.
   Mexico, which has a foreign debt of about $100 billion, relies
on its oil sales to help keep current on its loan payments and buy
needed imports for its developing economy.
   President Miguel de la Madrid has in recent years pushed to
reduce the nation's dependence on crude exports and build up sales
of non-oil goods to foreign buyers.

   The Sara Lee Corp. announced Wednesday that it
will launch a cash tender offer of $10 a share for up to 7.5
million shares of common stock of the Pannill Knitting Co. of
Virginia.
   The 7.5 million shares represent half the outstanding shares of
Pannill stock. The offer is being made through a wholly owned
subsidiary, Sara Lee officials said in a statement.
   Sara Lee said it expects to begin the tender offer within five
business days. Completion of the takeover would be conditioned on
approval of the Pannill board of directors.
   Pannill, headquartered in Martinsville, Va., is a manufacturer
and distributor of fleeced sportswear. The company reported sales
of $259.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 1987.
   Chicago-based Sara Lee is a food and consumer products company
with annual sales of approximately $10 billion.
   Sara Lee also said it has entered into a stock option agreement
with several stockholders, including officers and directors of
Pannill, who together own about 53 percent of outstanding shares.
   Under the agreement, if Sara Lee is unsuccessful in obtaining
Pannill shares through the cash offer, the corporation may purchase
from the stockholders the number of shares it needs, the company
said.
