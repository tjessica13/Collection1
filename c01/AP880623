<HEAD>Researchers Find Census Thought Destroyed by Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet demographer was quoted as saying
Wednesday that researchers have found the results of a 1937 census
thought to have been destroyed by Josef V. Stalin to hide millions
of deaths caused by his policies.
   Demographer Mark Tolts said the census showed a population of
162 million, the official Tass news agency said.
   The weekly magazine Ogonyok, in a story about the census
published in December, said Stalin claimed a population in 1937 of
170 million even though statistics could not confirm it.
   Tolts did not say where the census results were found, and said
it was too early to use its figures to estimate how many people
died in the purges, collectivization of agriculture and forced
industrialization Stalin imposed in the 1930s.
   Current Soviet reference books put the population at 163 million
for 1917, the year of the revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to
power. The current population is 284 million.
   Ogonyok blamed many of the deaths on a famine forced upon rural
residents by government grain requisitions, but Tolts said Stalin's
repressive policies also apparently were to blame.
   He said the population of the Saratov region on the Volga River
southeast of Moscow declined by 20 percent between 1927 and 1937,
and the population of the Kursk region south of Moscow declined by
14 percent in the same period.
   Stalin told a Communist Party congress in 1934 that the Soviet
population the previous year was 168 million, although census
officials put the figure at 165.7 million and one scientist put it
as low as 158 million.

   A black man walking home from his job at a
fast-food restaurant was attacked early Wednesday by six white men
who shouted racial slurs as they pummelled him with sticks and a
baseball bat, police said.
   The victim, Raymond Buckner, took refuge in a pizza parlor,
where the owners defended him against the gang and were themselves
later harassed and assaulted, according to police.
   Three whites were arrested, and police were seeking three others.
   Buckner, 24, was treated for bruises at a hospital and released.
   He said the assault, which occurred on Staten Island, reminded
him of the attack by a dozen white youths on three blacks in the
Howard Beach section of Queens in December 1986.
   In that highly publicized case, one of the black men died when
he was hit by a car while trying to escape. Three white teens were
convicted of manslaughter last December.
   ``It's the same incident, racial,'' said Buckner, who was
treated for contusions at St. Vincent's Hospital. ``I was minding
my own business. I just get jumped for no reason.''
   A short time after the attack, officers arrested Frank Dessoye,
19; Steven P. Russell, 18; and Michael Kish, 20, all of Staten
Island.
   They were charged with second-degree assault, aggravated
harassment, criminal possession of a deadly instrument and
possession of a controlled substance, marijuana. Dessoye was also
charged with driving while intoxicated.
   ``Howard Beach was the first thing I thought of,'' said Jeff
Lamartina, one of the owners of the Cafe DiSicilia pizzeria, who
aided Buckner. ``It wasn't right. This guy was doing nothing
wrong.''
   Buckner, a cook at a Burger King restaurant, said he was walking
home through a mostly white section of Staten Island at about 12:20
a.m. when a car slowed down and the occupants began harassing him.
   ``They were calling me racial names _ nigger, blackie,'' Buckner
said. The men left their car and began beating him on the arm with
sticks and a baseball bat, chasing him down the street.
   When Buckner fled into the pizzeria, ``he was nervous; his arm
was messed up,'' Lamartina said. ``He said he just got jumped by a
carload of white guys.''
   Lamartina gave Buckner some ice and offered to have a worker
drive him home. The group of white men appeared in front of the
store, but they left after Lamartina and an employee went outside
to disperse them.
   At about 1:20 a.m., after Buckner had been taken home, the group
reappeared in front of the pizza parlor and taunted LaMartina and
the store's other owner, Sal Taormina, calling them ``nigger
lovers,'' LaMartina said. Both owners are white.
   ``One of them had a bat, and went to swing it at me, but Sal
caught it,'' Lamartina recounted. ``We smacked them around a little
bit, and they ran away.''
   Neighbors who had witnessed the altercation called police, as
did Buckner when he got home.
   A short time later, officers pulled over a red car and arrested
Frank Dessoye, 19, Steven P. Russell, 18, and Michael Kish, 20, all
of Staten Island. They were identified by Buckner, LaMartina and
Taormina as the assailants.
   The three men were charged with second-degree assault,
aggravated harassment, criminal possession of a deadly instrument
and criminal possession of a controlled substance, marijuana.
Dessoye was also charged with driving while intoxicated.
   All three pleaded innocent to the charges before Criminal Court
Judge Michael J. Brennan. Bail was set for Dessoye at $5,275 and
$2,500 for both Russell and Kish.

   A new film talent has emerged from the satirical
movie ``A Handful of Dust.'' Her name is Kristin Scott Thomas.
   The movie features Alec Guinness and Anjelica Huston in small
but telling cameos, but it is dominated by Scott Thomas as the
elegant English rose, Lady Brenda Last, who drifts into a
destructive affair with the young roue John Beaver (Rupert Graves).
   Based on Evelyn Waugh's savage 1934 novel, the $6 million film
co-stars James Wilby (Graves' co-star last year in ``Maurice'') as
Lady Brenda's hapless husband, Tony. It opens in New York on June
24.
   ``I'm very pleased, I'm afraid, about the reaction that I'm
getting. It's so nice to have one's work appreciated,'' Scott
Thomas said in an interview about her repeated raves from the
British press.
   While reviews were mixed for the movie as a whole, critics
hailed its female lead with the kind of accolades that banish
anonymity forever.
   Alexander Walker in The Standard called the actress ``the film's
great find,'' adding, ``It will be criminal if British cinema
doesn't ... make a great star of her.''
   Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd in The Daily Telegraph and Derek
Malcolm in The Guardian both called her ``a revelation.'' Iain
Johnstone in The Sunday Times found the Paris-based actress ``a
singular sensation'' in a movie that has returned her in triumph to
the country she left eight years ago.
   ``I never really thought I'd be able to work in England, so `A
Handful of Dust' was an enormous pleasure and a great privilege,''
said the 28-year-old actress, who dropped out of London's Central
School of Speech and Drama after a year to move to Paris.
   ``I was doing a teacher training course and hated it, wanted to
change and couldn't,'' said Scott Thomas, occasionally interrupting
the interview to tend to the cries of her month-old daughter,
Hannah.
   ``I was told I'd never be an actress anyway, and would never be
able to play for real,'' she said. ``I thought it would be better
to be totally miserable somewhere else and learn French at the same
time.''
   In Paris, her life took a happier turn, beginning with her
marriage to a French obstetrician. After drama training in French,
she began getting parts in theater and in movies, and landed a role
opposite the rock superstar Prince in his second movie, a bomb
called ``Under the Cherry Moon.''
   The film was not a financial success and was lampooned by
critics. However, it enjoyed an international release. Charles
Sturridge, the director of ``Handful of Dust'' and of the hit Waugh
TV adaptation, ``Brideshead Revisited,'' saw it and cast Scott
Thomas as Lady Brenda.
   She had studied the book at school and said she seized the
chance to become part of the film.
   ``I was sure it was going to be great,'' she recalled, before
going back to the novel to immerse herself in Lady Brenda's
emotionally fatal attraction to the callow and cunning Beaver.
   ``She likes taking someone who is absolutely dreadful and
turning him into this fascinating young man whom no one can
understand what she sees in him,'' Scott Thomas said, explaining
the fascination on which the film's denouement depends: ``It makes
her different, too.''
   ``In the end, Beaver is much worse than Lady Brenda ever thought
he was, really; by then she's in too deep,'' she said.
   The daughter of an affluent naval officer who died when she was
five, Scott Thomas said she was bemused by the critique of the
English class system that pervades the book and the film.
   ``It's quite sort of endearing, really, but it is ridiculous,''
said Scott Thomas, a graduate of the posh Cheltenham Ladies'
College. ``It's like some dear old piece of furniture that you like
but you think is quite the most hideous thing in the world.''
   She hopes not to be typecast as aristocratic English swells, and
would like to do a French film next.
   ``I live there and I want to work there. You have to work hard,
and I really mean to work hard,'' she said. ``I've got to make sure
that the revelation doesn't turn out to be a disaster.''

   The commuter train zips along at
50 miles an hour. On top of a car a young man stands up and waves
his arms like a bird in flight.
   The slightest slip could mean a fatal fall; the slightest jolt
could mean contact with a 3,000-volt electrical wire overhead.
   Nevertheless, Paulo Evaristo, 15, and hundreds of other youths
from Rio de Janeiro's poor outlying suburbs risk their lives every
day showing off their skills in what is known as train surfing.
   Some 150 train surfers were killed last year, 40 in the first
five months of this year.
   The government company that runs the commuter trains has had to
pay the equivalent of $700,000 in claims filed by the survivors of
youths killed or by youths who have been injured. More than 400
young men were injured in 1987, some permanently paralyzed.
   ``These people are seeking new thrills, but in my opinion
they're suicidal,'' said Helio Barros, spokesman for the railroad.
He added that efforts to discourage the train surfers have failed.
   ``With the money we spent on claims, we could have repaired 10
trains,'' he said. He added that the railroad is trying to persuade
judges not to validate claims in cases of train-surfing accidents.
   ``I've been doing this since I was 13,'' said Paulo Evaristo.
``You get a feeling of freedom that is greater than any fear.''
   Paulo Evaristo is a grade-school dropout and works as a
messenger. He declined to give his last name in an interview.
   Train surfers come from poor neighborhoods, and some Brazilian
newspapers have speculated the young people are trying to emulate
the sea surfers at wealthy beachfront districts, such as Copacabana
and Ipanema. The newspaper accounts also have suggested the surfers
ride train roofs because they can't afford the 15-cruzado (8-cent)
fare, or that there's no room in the crowded trains, which
transport 1.2 million passengers daily.
   But Barros, the railroad spokesman, dismissed all these
arguments.
   ``It's strictly for the fun,'' he said. ``In the first place,
you have to pay the fare to get inside the train stations. And even
when it's not rush hour and there are plenty of seats, you still
see these kids on top of the cars.''
   The train company has assigned 200 guards a day to try to stop
train surfers. But the guards are not enough to cover the commuter
system's 450 miles of track and 110 stations.
   When they do arrest a train surfer, the penalty is a fine
equivalent to $1 and a lecture from a government psychologist.
   ``The purpose is not to jail these people,'' Barros said. ``It
is to save their lives.''
   Chief Fernando Rodrigues de Almeida of the police precinct of
the Engenho Novo neighborhood ordered 11 train surfers jailed
without bail on charges of obstructing railroad traffic.
   But a judge ruled that train surfing was not a crime, but rather
an act of ``self-injury,'' similar to attempted suicide, and not
dealt with in the Brazilian legal code.
   The judge reprimanded the chief for abuse of authority.
   ``We're not crazy, and we're not bums either,'' said train
surfer Luiz Claudio, 18, an apprentice lathe operator who makes $70
a month, slightly more than the minimum wage. ``We're just looking
for a little fun, to pass the time during the train ride.''
   Elizabeth, 19, a maid, who like Luiz Claudio would not tell her
last name, said she sometimes rides on top of the commuter trains
because the atmosphere inside the cars is ``violent,'' with
frequent muggings. But she added, ``It's a lot of fun, too.''
   Barros, the railroad spokesman, said train surfers have always
been a problem, but the practice reached an all-time high last year.
   He added that the suburb of Nilopolis has a ``Train Surfers
Association'' with three tests for membership: 1) Ride hanging from
the outside of a window or door. 2) Climb up a car in motion and
lie on the roof. 3) Stand on the roof of a moving car.
   The founder of the association, known as Rambo, was killed when
he fell from a train.
   Another member of the group who was killed had a membership card
in his pocket.
   It said, ``Evanil dos Santos passed his test and is authorized
to hang from trains.''

<HEAD>Manigat Apparently Misread Haitian Army's Inner Workings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Leslie Manigat, a political science
professor with pride in his grasp of strategy, apparently
misunderstood the army and may have been duped into trying to
exploit what he read as dissension within it.
   His attempt didn't work, and the general who handed Manigat the
presidency in February took it back and sent him into exile.
   Several versions are circulating of the overthrow of Manigat
this week by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who ran the ruling junta for
two years after the Duvalier dictatorship ended and proclaimed
himself president Monday.
   All focus on miscalculations by Manigat, a civilian who was
eager to assert control over the army after four months in power.
   Some say Manigat overreached by trying to use what seemed to be
a split between Namphy and Col. Jean-Claude Paul, a powerful
commander, to carry out a general purge of the army. Others say the
dispute between Namphy and Paul may itself have been a sham, and
Manigat walked into the trap.
   The army has not explained.
   A friend and sometime adviser to Namphy said privately ``the
high command tricked Manigat,'' using his desire to control the
army as a tool to overthrow him.
   Namphy's escape from house arrest Sunday evening and his noisy
takeover of the National Palace ``seems to have been a well-set-up
sham,'' a Western diplomat said, also on condition of anonymity.
   No one was killed and nothing destroyed at the palace, the scene
of most of the shooting Sunday night, and soldiers who allegedly
were fighting one another at midnight stood together amicably on
television early in the morning.
   About 1:30 a.m., only 55 minutes after the heaviest gunfire,
Namphy appeared on television at the palace carrying an Uzi
submachine gun. A military band played the national anthem.
   When he announced a military government later in the morning,
also on television, he was surrounded by Paul and representatives
of other units. The 7,000-man army appears united behind him.
   Later Monday, he announced promotions of officers Manigat had
retired or transferred, including Col. Prosper Avril to brigadier
general and adjutant general of the military. Many observers
believe Avril, who had been a military adviser to the Duvaliers,
was a key figure in the coup.
   Political observers still are trying to piece together how
Namphy ended up in the National Palace and Manigat in a small hotel
in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic on the other
side of Hispaniola island.
   This is what is known:
   Namphy tried 10 days ago to transfer Paul to an administrative
post from command of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion stationed
just behind the National Palace. Paul refused. Manigat sided with
Paul and dismissed Namphy as army chief on Friday.
   When Namphy appeared to accept, ``Manigat thought he had an
opportunity'' to exert control over officers who had hampered his
initiatives since he took office, a diplomat said.
   The portly 57-year-old professor and linguist, who has studied
and lectured at some of the world's major universities, tried his
own series of transfers and promotions Sunday afternoon.
   Within hours he was arrested and sent with his family across the
border to the Dominican Republic. Manigat admitted Tuesday he was
surprised by the coup, had believed most of the military supported
him and didn't understand why Paul rejoined Namphy.
   U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who follows events in Haiti
closely, said it appears Manigat hoped to consolidate power by
dominating the army as Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier did.
   ``The Duvaliers were able to control the military for years by a
divide, confuse and conquer approach,'' Graham said from
Washington. The Duvaliers frequently dismissed officers they
distrusted, and they diluted the army's power with a private
security force, the feared Tontons Macoute.
   Jean-Claude Duvalier, son of Papa Doc, fled the country Feb. 7,
1986, ending the 29-year family dictatorship, and the junta led by
Namphy took over.
   Graham said one interpretation of the Namphy-Paul rift was that
Paul realized ``the Namphy components of the army were stronger, so
he recognized he didn't have an alternative other than to cut a
deal.''
   Another theory is that Manigat simply gambled and lost, that a
showdown with the army was inevitable and he moved when he thought
his chances were best.
   Namphy's brother Joe, a businessman, has said the general did
not know soldiers would free him Sunday night. A close friend of
Gen. Namphy said Manigat put him up to transferring Paul and turned
on the general when Paul refused to go.
   Paul has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal
court in Florida. He a dominant figure in Haiti's army, which is
top-heavy with officers and so factionalized that a colonel can be
more powerful than a general.
   Namphy's justification for returning to the palace was that
Manigat's attempted reorganization of the army was
unconstitutional, dangerously partisan and endangered democracy.

   Beachgoers soaking up the Hawaiian summer sun
were serenaded by the strains of ``White Christmas'' and ``Jingle
Bell Rock'' on a radio station here.
   KSSK Radio billed Wednesday as a day of yuletide music to remind
listeners that drinking and driving kills.
   ``We've had 41 traffic fatalities so far this year and if we
continue at this rate we'll have 46 more before Christmas,'' said
Suzi Mechler, KSSK director of operations. ``So we're playing them
their Christmas music now.''
   There were 32 traffic fatalities on Honolulu roads at the same
time last year, police said.
   Mechler said the music also was played to give would-be drinken
drivers a desire to live until Christmas and to think before
getting behind the wheel.
   Mechler said the station has celebrated Christmas in June for
the past three or four years.

<HEAD>World Record $1.2 Million Paid For Stradivari Cello</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anonymous bidder paid $1.2 million for a cello
made by Antonio Stradivari about 1698 _ a world record auction
price for a musical instrument, the Sotheby's auction house said.
   The cello, known as the Cholmondeley after a previous owner, was
auctioned Wednesday and the seller also asked to remain anonymous.
   The previous record for a musical instrument was $890,000 paid
by an anonymous South American in London on March 31 for a violin
known as the Marie Hall that was also made by Stradivari, an
Italian.
   The previous record for a cello was $393,000 paid in 1984 by
Robert Cohen, an eminent London cellist, for a Stradivari
instrument known as the Bonjour.
   Sotheby's said several people were bidding for the Cholmondeley
``in a relaxed way.'' They said they were not surprised by the
price as they had expected the cello to sell for at least $1
million.
   They said the buyer might decide at some time to disclose his or
her identity.
   British cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, younger brother of composer
Andrew Lloyd Webber, spent $280,000 in 1986 on a Stradivari cello
and was not immediately identified as the purchaser.
   ``The Cholmondeley (pronounced Chumley) is so well made that it
almost plays itself _ as if it had cruise control,'' said Adam
Watson, the cataloguer of Wednesday's auction.
   The cello has a head by a different maker, Joannnes Florenus
Guidantus. The instrument is just over 29 inches long and rich
golden-brown in color.
   It belonged in the mid-19th century to the Marquess of
Cholmondeley. It later went to the United States and was played at
the Stradivari memorial concert in 1937 by Ralph Oxman.
   ``It is a well-known instrument and has been in the hands of
several collectors recently,'' said Watson.

   They came to curry Caesar, not craze him.
   Caesar, an African gray parrot that's been the Briere family pet
for 11 years, took his first-ever flight Sunday afternoon while his
cage was being moved outside and spent two days as a free bird.
   The parrot, who eschews the traditional cracker in favor of
provolone cheese and bolgona, perched atop a tall tree across the
street from his home after he flew the coop. Caesar remained free
until Tuesday.
   The fire department on Sunday responded by sending Chief Charles
``Buddy'' Judd up in a ladder truck bucket. Judd said as soon as he
got close, Caesar just squealed and flew away.
   The bird's quest for freedom kept family members, friends and
neighbors busy as they took shifts throughout the day and night
keeping track of the parrot, according a family member.
   Jeannine Briere said she spent the days sitting in the back
yard, whistling and calling the bird until her voice started
tiring. She then made a tape recording of her calls and played it
over and over.
   Her husband, Fern, said he told her at one point that the parrot
was trying to come home, but didn't know how to land.
   On Tuesday, the Brieres bought a large fishing net and attached
it to a 10-foot pole.
   After tracking Caesar to a neighbor's tree, they reached up and
after a couple of tries, bagged the bird.
   Briere, with gloves on, grabbed the bird from the net. Caesar's
first word was ``Hello.''

   A falafel vendor is claiming victory in a food
fight against hot dogs.
   The ruckus started when David Bonan, who has sold falafel at
South Florida street festivals for nine years, moved his sidewalk
cart to a busy downtown street where hot-dog carts have long had a
monopoly.
   The hot dog vendors complained, and Dade County health
inspectors ordered Bonan to close the business March 9. Florida's
health code limits mobile food units to ``frankfurters only,'' they
said.
   That's because hot dogs are covered with ``a membrane that
prevents pathogenic organisms from entering the food.''
   Bonan claimed the code was unconstitutional, sued the state in
federal court and refused to budge. Earlier this month, a health
inspector and three police officers confiscated $100 of falafel,
doused it with liquid bleach and threatened to arrest Bonan if he
didn't stop.
   An emergency hearing was held Friday and U.S Magistrate Samuel
Smargon ruled in Bonan's favor.
   ``Just standing up for my rights through the legal system,''
said Bonan, who vows to add two carts selling the mashed chick-pea
mixture on city streets by next week.
   The state has 10 days to appeal. Al Ros, assistant county
director of environmental health, said he is worried that the
falafel case will open the streets to everything from tacos to
chicken wings.

   Doorknobs are back at police headquarters, but
there are no so suspects in the theft of six ornate knobs stolen
last month.
   Police say they are more vigilant about watching the hardware _
and each other.
   So was the doorknob caper an inside job?
   ``We're not sure who did it,'' police spokesman Jim Jordan said.
``Police or no police, it's a work place.''
   Half a dozen metal knobs the color of pewter and embossed with
the city seal were discovered missing about five weeks ago. They
disappeared one night from middle-level floors, where
administrative offices are located in the seven-floor building that
was built in 1924.
   The knobs have since been replaced, some with the same fancy
design, others without. Jordan said he didn't know the knobs'
value, but said it was modest.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has passed a law that will ensure the
integrity of spirits labeled ``Scotch'' by making the appellation a
protected trademark.
   Under the law, no whisky can be called Scotch unless it conforms
to standards set by the Scotch Whisky Association: matured for at
least three years, in oak casks with charred insides, and using
only Scottish ingredients like Highland water.
   The law passed the House of Lords Tuesday and now awaits the
formality of the queen's signature, said Bill Walker, a Scottish
lawmaker for the ruling Conservative Party and sponsor of the bill.
   Walker said Wednesday that the new law would empower whisky
distillers to prosecute anyone violating Scotch standards. He said
it was modeled on a law that prevents drinks being called champagne
unless they come from the province of Champagne in France and
conform to its standards.
   Walker said more than 90 percent of Scotch is exported, and
earns Scotland $1.8 billion a year.

   Two escaped murderers from the
Kentucky State Penitentiary were captured in a rural field
Wednesday night after a brief exchange of gunfire with state police.
   State police Sgt. Mike Sapp said nobody was injured during the
exchange.
   He said Ronnie Hudson, 29, and Joseph Montgomery, 27, were taken
into custody about 8:21 p.m. in a cornfield about 300 feet from a
temporary command post that state police had set up in a church
parking lot.
   The two were seen crawling through the field by several children
playing kickball behind the church before Wednesday night prayer
meeting.
   The two surrendered after their escape from the field was halted
by a barbed wire fence. Both men were armed, Sapp said.
   Sapp said Hudson had died his hair red, and Montgomery had cut
his hair.
   State police said neighborhood children had found two tote bags
Tuesday night that were believed to have been dropped by the
escapees. The bags contained bullets, clothing and hair dye.
   The escapees, both from Louisville, were among eight who fled
the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville in western Kentucky
last Thursday. Three others have been captured.
   State police said they believed the two men had been staying
with friends or relatives of Hudson's since arriving in the area
Sunday.
   ``I anticipate some charges against local people for aiding
these fugitives,'' said state police Sgt. Mike Sapp.
   Those still at large include another murderer, James Blanton,
29, of Farler; Billy Hall, 25, of Paducah, serving 23 years for
burglary and assault, and Derek Quintero, 26, of Clarksville,
Tenn., serving 37 years for kidnapping and robbery.
   The eight sawed their way to freedom from an upper level of
Cellhouse 3. The breakout was apparently well-planned, with inmates
on the cellhouse's lower level setting small, diversionary fires to
distract guards.
   Officials in Dover, Tenn., were investigating Wednesday whether
the murder of an elderly couple in rural Leatherwood, a resort
community on Kentucky Lake about 50 miles south of the prison, was
linked to the escapes.
   Stewart County Sheriff's dispatcher Tina Hicks said
investigators from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and a
laboratory team from the Tennessee Highway Patrol linked the
slayings to the fugitives, but had no details.

<DATELINE>ZAVALLA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by a back-to-nature group to hold a
gathering of thousands of people in a national forest has prompted
the U.S. Forest Service to place 24 additional officers on patrol.
   Between 12,000 and 20,000 people are expected to attend the
annual ``gathering of the tribes'' held by the Rainbow Family
during the Fourth of July weekend, officials said.
   The Forest Service blocked roads to the site where many are
camped after the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals last week
reinstated a temporary restraining order forbidding more than 25
Rainbow Family members from meeting in one place without a Forest
Service permit.
   An appeals panel has not announced if it will continue the
restraining order while considering an appeal of a ruling by U.S.
District Judge William Wayne Justice that the group doesn't need a
permit.
   About 400 ``family'' members are now camped in the forest,
officials said Tuesday. One forest service agent is usually
assigned to the area.

   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke arrived in
the U.S. capital Wednesday for meetings with President Reagan and
the leading presidential candidates and to speak to both houses of
Congress.
   The prime minister and his wife, Hazel Masterson Hawke, were in
Chicago and New York this week. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and Mrs. Shultz met their helicopter near the Washington monument
and escorted them to their hotel.
   Shultz hosted a dinner for the Hawkes at the State Department
Wednesday night and praised Australia's strong ties with the United
States.
   He said the Soviet Union was posing new challenges in Asia and
the two allies must face the question ``how do we meet the
challenge.''
   On Cambodia, where the Soviet-backed Vietnam is withdrawing some
of its forces, Shultz said ``we must keep up the pressure now that
we see things are going our way.''
   Hawke paid tribute to Shultz as a good friend of Australia and
joined him in calling for an end to agricultural subsidies. ``It's
insane to spend $200 billion on them,'' Hawke said.
   Hawke told a television interviewer his message to Congress and
other U.S. leaders will be Australia's familiar appeal against U.S.
farm subsidies that Australia says are unfair competition and cause
economic harm to ``a first class ally of America, the best ally
you've got.''
   In trade, ``that first class relationship isn't reflected. We
don't like our farmers and our economy being hurt by action here
which is against your own interests. ... That's my message,'' Hawke
said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``It's against the self-interest of the United States to be
spending the billions of dollars it is on farm supports and
subsidies,'' Hawke said. ``It doesn't get into the right hands. It
increases the cost and price structure of this country.''
   But Australians, with unsubsidized wheat and meat to export, are
``the innocent people in the middle who get caught by the subsidies
cross fire between the Europeans and the Americans,'' Hawke added.
   The prime minister also branded as ``nonsense'' the New Zealand
anti-nuclear restrictions that barred American warships from
visiting New Zealand and led to New Zealand's ouster from the
three-cornered ANZUS alliance between the two South Pacific
countries and the United States.
   Seventy-four U.S. warships visited Australia last year with ``no
restrictions,'' Hawke said. ``We've got an alliance relationship
with the United States, and we don't buy the New Zealand
proposition that you can have an alliance relationship and say to
your ally, `We're allies, but I'm sorry, boys, your ships can't
come.''
   Hawke will address a meeting of the two houses of Congress on
Thursday and then lunch with Reagan. An afternoon meeting was
planned with Vice President George Bush, probable Republican
candidate in the November presidential election, and the Hawkes'
host at dinner later Thursday.
   The Australian Embassy said Hawke also would meet Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, the probable Democratic Party candidate for
president.
   Hawke planned to fly Friday to a speaking engagement at Austin,
Texas.

<HEAD>Smooth Ride At Summit Reflects Japan's Emerging Role in World
Affairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A familiar ingredient was missing from this
week's economic summit in Toronto: No one did any Japan-bashing.
   Unlike past summits when the Japanese sat quietly on the
sidelines and other countries complained of surging trade deficits,
Toronto was more like a corporate board meeting with Japan an equal
partner.
   ``Statistics talked on our behalf,'' explained Michihiko
Kunihiro, chief cabinet counselor on foreign affairs.
   He was referring to three inter-related developments in Japan's
economy.
   Over the last three years, the value of the yen has doubled
against the dollar, making Japanese exports more expensive and
American imports cheaper. Second, Japan has agreed it needs to
develop its domestic market and thus increase its import. Most
important, the island nation has promised to work for a gradual
narrowing of its record trade surpluses.
   The performance of the Japanese economy led several summit
partners to compliment Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
making his debut at the annual gatherings.
   ``He was very pleased,'' said Kunihiro.
   By fully cooperating with international efforts to coordinate
economic policies, Japan now feels treated like an ``insider'' in
the cliquish Group of Seven major industrialized democracies, he
said.
   ``Perhaps Japanese leaders finally thought they can contribute
more substantively than before. I will leave the judgment to you,''
Kunihiro said of the Toronto meeting.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Community Commission,
referred to the gathering as a ``trilateral'' summit that balanced
the interests of Western Europe, North America and ``Japan with
Asia behind it.''
   Takeshita expressed satisfaction that action was taken on all
three of his priorities. There was a joint commitment to
growth-without-inflation, a determination to fight protectionism
and agreement on relieving Third World debt.
   Japan used the summit platform to announce its waiving of $1
billion in debt repayments from 17 of the world's poorest countries
over the next five years.
   Even on farm subsidies, the result was to Japan's liking.
President Reagan had proposed ending the $200 billion subsidy war
by the year 2000, but the final communique merely targeted
reductions provided such factors as ``social concerns,'' ``food
security'' and agricultural ``diversity'' are taken into account.
   Farmers in Japan are a powerful political force and farm
subsidies, including tariffs that restrict competition from cheaper
American goods, are their life blood.
   Even as the summiteers gathered, Japan reached agreement with
the United States in a longstanding dispute over raising quotas for
U.S. beef and citrus products. Reagan and Takeshita also signed a
pact to open up Japanese laboratories to American researchers for
closer collaboration in science and technology.
   While not presuming to speak directly for Asia, Takeshita said
he was happy summit partners pledged a new dialogue with the newly
industrialized nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore. There was even speculation that the so-called ``four
tigers'' might be invited as observers at future summits, and the
suggestion Japan might stage an Asian economic summit.
   ``The Japanese have a growing sense that Japan should play a
greater role in affairs outside Japan ... except for military
activities. That is something constitutionally we have to refrain
from,'' Kunihiro said.
   One future goal, the official said, is to help Japan's 122
million people mix better with the rest of the world.
   ``We should be better understood despite the difficult language
of Japanese, and try to educate our people (in other cultures),''
he said.
   This new, outgoing Japan was reflected in the summit briefings.
Foreign journalists, including Japanese speakers, were barred from
briefings for reporters from Japan _ a tradition. But there were
separate, informative and good-natured sessions in English.
   Kunihiro drew laughs when he sidestepped a question about vague
free-trade language in the final communique. ``This is the text my
boss agreed to,'' he said with a smile.

   The song of the sea is still music
to the ears of five fishermen now home to family and friends after
144 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a disabled boat.
   ``We're sea dogs. The sea calls to us,'' said one, 27-year-old
Joel Omar Gonzalez. ``The sea is the source of life for us and our
families.''
   The five, headed by skipper Gerardo Obregon, 33, received a
hero's welcome Wednesday from dozens of people including first lady
Margarita de Arias when they flew in from Honolulu by way of Los
Angeles.
   Relatives, friends, neighbors and fellow ``pescadores'' flocked
in from Puntarenas, their home port 95 miles away, to welcome them
at San Jose's Santamaria Airport.
   The engine of their 33-foot fishing vessel, the Cairo III, was
knocked out beyond repair during a storm Jan. 24, five days after
they sailed out of Puntarenas, leaving them adrift in the Pacific.
   What was to have been an eight-day fishing trip turned into a
nearly five-month quest for survival. Gonzalez, his eyes moist as
he hugged his wife, Edith, told reporters ships passed them twice
but did not see them.
   A Japanese tuna boat finally ran into them about 700 miles
southeast of Hawaii on June 15 and took them to Honolulu, where
doctors found them all in good health.
   All in all, it was a 3,600-mile journey.
   The five said they survived by catching turtles and sharks,
collecting rainwater and cooking them on wood fires they made by
tearing pieces of wood from the boat. They said the pain was in the
loneliness and not knowing when help would come.
   ``We spent months and months without seeing anyone, but we never
lost our faith in God. We knew he was with us and he finally sent
us this Japanese vessel,'' said crewman Jorge Hernandez Castillo,
22.
   Obregon, Gonzalez, Hernandez and their two mates _ Juan Cernas
Bolivar, 47, and Pastor Lopez Rojas, 30 _ attended Mass at a Roman
Catholic church and gave thanks for their deliverance.
   ``Imagine! Our little boat in the middle of the ocean,
directionless. The hot sun of the daytime, the darkness of the
night, the stars and the cold. They were truly terrible days,''
Obregon said.
   Once they had to go without water for four days because it
didn't rain and, Gonzalez said, ``There was a moment when were
drinking the blood of a turtle and I looked at Pastor and he was
foaming at the mouth.''
   The Cairo III and its crew may have broken the record for
survival at sea. The Guinness Book of World Records lists the
record for survival on a raft as 133 days, set by a Hong Kong man
who was adrift in the Atlantic Ocean from Nov. 23, 1942, to April
5, 1943 after his ship was torpedoed.

<HEAD>AIDS Confidentiality Bill Clears Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Expanded AIDS testing, mandatory counseling
and tough punishment for violations of patient confidentiality are
prescribed in a bill that won House committee approval after a year
of negotiation and compromise.
   ``We're going to move it as quickly as possible. The chances of
it passing are very, very bright. I expect it to become law this
year,'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Wednesday after the
Energy and Commerce Committee sent the measure to the House floor
by voice vote.
   The bill authorizes $400 million to expand testing and
counseling activities for each of the next three years. Half the
money would go to states and the other half would go directly to
clinics, health centers and hospitals.
   Counseling would be required for anyone taking a test, whether
the results were positive or negative. Anyone who intentionally or
negligently breached the confidentiality of test results could be
charged a fine of up to $10,000. An intentional violation could
also bring up to a year in jail.
   The bill bans use of federal funds for counseling ``that
promotes or encourages homosexual sexual activity or unsafe
heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous drug abuse.'' But it
also says counselors must provide the best information available on
how to avoid getting or transmitting AIDS, ``provided that any
informational materials used are not obscene.''
   The major casualty of the many controversies stirred by the bill
was a section banning private-sector discrimination against people
with AIDS or the AIDS virus. The federal government already has a
ban.
   Waxman, chairman of the Energy and Commerce health subcommittee,
called the omission unfortunate but said it would have been
impossible to pass such a policy in the current political climate.
   Getting rid of the discrimination provision also makes it much
less likely the bill will be blocked in the Senate, Waxman said,
because it ``removes the biggest objection that some of the
right-wingers have.'' The counseling and testing bill is pending in
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he may attempt to restore the
anti-discrimination provision on the House floor. He called its
deletion ``a terrible public health mistake'' because the most
likely AIDS victims, without protection against losing their jobs,
insurance or housing, would not volunteer for tests.
   Wyden said he would try to build bipartisan support for the
discrimination ban on the grounds that the president's commission
on AIDS recently recommended precisely such a federal policy.
   But Waxman said the commission view is useless without President
Reagan's backing. ``Without it I can't see that members are going
to be willing to vote for it, have the courage to vote for it, in
an election year,'' he said. ``If the president will stand behind
his commission's recommendations, we will join him in sponsoring an
amendment.''
   Before approving the AIDS testing bill, the committee rejected a
series of amendments sponsored by Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.
Among them were attempts to require testing of all prisoners,
marriage license applicants and hospital admittees.
   Dannemeyer also failed to win approval of a requirement that
people with AIDS or the AIDS virus be reported to authorities by
name; the bill requires instead that cases be reported with
statistical and demographic information.
   Another unsuccessful Dannemeyer amendment would have required
doctors to notify spouses, sex partners or IV needle partners if
the patient didn't notify them within a reasonable period. Members
of both parties said the bill permits doctors to make such
notifications but shouldn't require them to do so.
   AIDS renders the body's immune system incapable of resisting
other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected persons. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users.

   The drought that threatens U.S. crop
production also is sending shock waves through world markets and
prospects for exports, according to Agriculture Department analysts.
   But it could be one of those ``good news, bad news'' situations,
says Tom Kay, administrator of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service.
   ``There's no question that the higher commodity prices we see
today will likely raise the value of U.S. exports,'' Kay said. ``On
the other hand, you have to recognize that higher prices might
reduce the total quantity traded.''
   In other words, one bushel of wheat selling for $3 is worth as
much as three bushels selling for $1 each.
   Kay and other USDA and farm officials contacted Wednesday agreed
that it is too early for a realistic appraisal of the export
situation. No one can be sure what this year's harvests of corn,
wheat and soybeans will be, and until that is known, the global
supply and price situation is mostly guesswork.
   The department's first overall crop production estimates of the
season, including total wheat, corn and soybeans, will be released
on Aug. 11.
   Kay said there ``could be a tendency for foreign buyers to want
to increase nearby purchases to cover their future needs.'' And
that could cause even further upward pressure on commodity prices.
   Are there indications now that foreign buyers might be getting
leery of higher prices for U.S. grain?
   ``No, there hasn't been much activity of late in the
international market,'' Kay said. ``Not much is being sold
anywhere. There seems to be a general lull all over.''
   So it's wait-and-see what the drought will do, at least for many
foreign buyers. Meanwhile, the USDA has not revised its latest
export forecast, which showed the value of shipments in the fiscal
year that began last Oct. 1 could rise to $33.5 billion from $27.9
billion last season.
   The actual volume of products in the month-old forecast is
expected to rise to 145.5 million metric tons from 129.2 million
tons in 1986-87.
   Except for soybeans, which are in relatively scant supply, the
inventories of U.S. wheat and corn are more than ample to take care
of foreseeable export needs. The big question, which officials say
can't be answered now, is how much 1988 crop production will be
reduced and how far prices will increase.
   Paul Drazek of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Washington
office agreed that export prospects are undecipherable at this
point.
   ``Any time you have a drought of the apparent magnitude that
this is, you have to start to be concerned about what it will do to
our export volume,'' he said. ``My guess is that nobody quite knows
what the effect will be on production, so it's going to be
difficult to attach some kind of an estimate to the effect on
exports.''
   ``But with the price going up the way it is,'' Drazek continued,
``that alone will have a depressing effect on our ability to move
products.''
   Although there is a ``one-world market'' for some commodities,
he said, ``our prices are going to be less competitive ... and that
could have an effect on where people buy.''
   Bob Denman of the National Farmers Union said, ``The next couple
of weeks are going to really make the determination as to what
starts to happen in that export market.''
   Denman said that he ``wouldn't be surprised'' to see some
foreign buyers come back into the U.S. market for corn and other
feed grains to protect themselves against further crop
deterioration and even higher prices.
   Regarding wheat, Denman said that a lot will depend on the
quality of this year's European harvest and also on Canada's
production.
   ``It's not just in the United States,'' he said. ``That Canadian
crop, as I understand it, is really being hurt pretty bad, too.''

   Democratic platform writers, borrowing a page
from congressional procedures, are putting a preliminary draft into
a format that a party panel can mark up when it resumes
deliberations Friday in Denver.
   The Democratic platform drafting committee, headed by Rep.
William H. Gray III of Philadelphia, has already distributed a
draft document to the campaigns of Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson.
   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman serving as Michael
Dukakis's chief link to the platform committee, said Wednesday,
``There will be a draft put before the members Friday morning.''
   Barnes said the draft incorporates the dozen separate issue
``working papers'' produced at an earlier meeting of the platform
writers on Mackinac Island, Mich.
   ``It pulls them all together,'' he said.
   But Barnes said there has been no closing of the gap between the
Dukakis and Jackson camps on whether the platform should embrace
Jackson's call for higher taxes on the wealthy and a freeze on
Pentagon spending.
   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Democratic Platform
Committee, said the preliminary draft was still being finalized.
She called it ``a collective effort'' by the same people who
hammered out the earlier issue papers.
   The party released two final working papers on national security
and political empowerment. The former reflects the Dukakis
campaign's insistence that the platform call for ``stable'' defense
budgets; the latter, in a nod to Jackson, commits the party to
removing ``impediments to the one-person, one-vote principle.''
   Whatever emerges Friday from Gray's 16-member drafting committee
will be subject to further discussion and revision when the full
186-member Platform Committee meets over the weekend in Denver for
the first time.
   Jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight at next
month's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta over any platform
issue he chooses.
   Some Dukakis backers have hinted they would welcome a chance to
shoot down a plank promising a tax hike. Walter Mondale, the 1984
nominee, got nothing but grief from his promise to raise taxes.
   Gray, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has had his
staff put the draft in mark-up format, with numbered lines, to make
it easier for the drafting committee to make additions and
deletions.
   Although a Jackson supporter, Gray has been handling his
drafting role in an impartial fashion. The 16 members include six
each from the Dukakis and Jackson camps and four appointed by Paul
G. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, who has asked the platform writers
to produce a short, visionary statement, free of special interest
boilerplates.
   The new working paper on national security says the nation's
strength has been ``sapped by a defense establishment that has
wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of
investing more in readiness and mobility.''
   ``We further believe that our strength is enhanced by stable
defense budgets and by a commitment by our allies to assure their
fair share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintain
peace and liberty,'' the paper says.
   It says the Democrats ``will promote peace and prevent war _ not
by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to
undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting a
tyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a
stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat,
in standing up to any American adversary whenever necessary and
sitting down with him whenever possible.''
   The document calls for ``maintaining the special relationship
with Israel,'' while promoting a Middle East agreement that hews to
the Camp David Accords. It says a Democratic administration would
``end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement
and will declare South Africa a terrorist state (and) impose
comprehensive sanctions.''
   The paper would commit the party to same-day voter registration
and registration by mail and calls for a removal of ``impedidents
to the one-person, one-vote principle,'' it said.
   Jackson, who won 29 percent of the primary votes but just 24
percent of the delegates, has complained about the way some states
allocated delegates.

<HEAD>Classified Documents Ruling Indicates Fall Trial for North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case
is setting up procedures for dealing with classified documents in
an apparent effort to bring fired White House aide Oliver L. North
to trial by fall.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ordered North to identify
by July 11 which secret government documents the retired Marine
lieutenant colonel wants to disclose in court to rebut charges that
he illegally diverted Iranian arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   In a ruling on Wednesday, Gesell said that both the public and
prosecutors would be barred from a July 14 hearing to determine if
any of the documents are relevant to the case against North.
   The judge also rejected a defense motion to declare the
Classified Information Procedures Act unconstitutional as it
applied to the case of North, former national security adviser John
M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   The four defendants, whom Gesell has said must be tried
separately, contended that the law unfairly required them to tell
the prosecution what documents they intended to make public before
the trials.
   Such disclosures would give independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh an unfair tactical advantage, the defense said.
   Acknowledging the problem, Gesell said ``strict application of
the statute to this proceeding would not only be difficult, but
impossible to accomplish consistent with a fair and expeditious
resolution of this case.''
   Gesell noted that the large volume of classified documents
collected by Walsh's investigation about 200,000 pages by the
latest count _ posed unique problems for a trial judge that were
probably not envisioned when Congress passed the classified
information statute in 1980.
   ``Some of the witnesses and defendants, particularly North,
operated from secure locations in the White House with full access
to the most sensitive information and most critical national
security intelligence methods and sources available to the
government,'' Gesell said.
   ``This information, and even some methods and sources, are
inextricably enmeshed in the events challenged by the indictment,''
he added.
   But in enacting the law, Congress gave trial judges authority
``to fashion creative and fair solutions'' to difficult problems
posed by such sensitive information, Gesell said.
   Lawmakers ``emphasized that the court should not undertake to
balance the national security interests of the government against
the rights of the defendant but rather that in the end remedies and
sanctions against the government must be designed to make the
defendant whole again.''
   ``While afforded this leeway, the court is unable to determine
definitively at this stage whether or not the classified document
problems presented by this case can be resolved,'' Gesell said in
the 16-page opinion.
   ``It proposes to make the effort, but the complexity of the
situation defies obvious answers. Final ruling on the (defense)
motion must await further developments.''
   Gesell said that he would exclude Walsh from discussions of
whether classified documents that North proposes to disclose are
relevant to the case. Gesell will decide which documents are
relevant and admissible as evidence.
   Only after an interdepartmental task force has identified
relevant documents that pose national security problems will Walsh
be included in the process of how to present them in court, Gesell
said.
   Indicating a desire to move the case to trial, Gesell gave the
government secrecy experts until Aug. 1 to complete their review of
the documents identified by North.
   The task force, composed of representatives of various
government intelligence agencies, is reviewing the documents that
Walsh collected during his investigation from the CIA, the FBI, the
National Security Council, the State Department and the Defense
Department.
   After the panel's task is completed, Gesell said he would
convene closed hearings to determine how to edit out portions of
documents that cannot be declassified.
   Under the law, the court has the power to order deletions of
sensitive material or to substitute a statement of facts that the
document would prove if it were shown to the jury.
   If a sufficient number of documents cannot be disclosed in any
fashion, the court can dismiss charges against a defendant on the
ground he could not get a fair trial.
   Gesell's ruling follows his determination last week that Walsh's
investigation was not tainted by impermissible use of the testimony
that North, Poindexter and Hakim gave to Congress last year under
limited grants of immunity from prosecution.
   Both decisions indicate that Gesell has determined that, barring
unforeseen problems created by classified documents, the case can
move ahead to trial by September.
   In a statement, Walsh said: ``We appreciate the court's prompt
ruling on the constitutionality of the Classified Information
Procedures Act as it applies to this case and we are prepared to
move forward as directed by the court.''

   Ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov has
canceled a nationwide tour to undergo surgery for an aggravated
knee condition, his spokesman said.
   Baryshnikov, artistic director of the American Ballet Theater,
had scheduled 28 dance performances of his own, from Arlington,
Texas, on July 1 to Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 7, said spokesman
Bernie Lawrence on Wednesday.
   The surgery, to correct an aggravated condition of his knee,
will be performed in New York City, possibly Tuesday, said
Lawrence, who would not give identify the hospital.
   ``The subsequent recovery period will be determined by the
findings at surgery,'' said a statement by Baryshnikov's publicist,

   Sylvester Stallone has filed a $3 million
lawsuit against Colt Industries, alleging a photograph and caption
in Guns Magazine falsely implied he endorsed a Colt handgun.
   In the Superior Court lawsuit filed here, Stallone claims a
Connecticut advertising agency hired by Colt contacted his agent
asking to use his name and photograph to promote a 45.-caliber,
$1,500 pistol called the Heirloom gun.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday, said Stallone refused, and after
that, Colt requested a bogus article to be placed in the magazine
with an accompanying photograph of Colt's fake Heirloom gun firearm
with Stallone's name inscribed on the barrel.
   The picture printed in the July 1987 issue shows the actor, the
gun and a caption saying ``Sylvester Stallone's personal Colt
Heirloom gun.''
   ``We have no comment on the lawsuit or firearm in question,''
Peter Williamson, spokesman for New York-based Colt Industries,
said Wednesday. Guns Magazine is not a defendant.
   The star of such action-packed films as ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo''
said his reputation and the market value of his name were damaged
and he should receive profits Colt unfairly gained from them.

<HEAD>Panel Wants Two Special Tax Breaks Back in Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House tax-writers want to renew two targeted
benefits of the type that were supposed to be wiped out when the
tax law was overhauled in 1986.
   The House Ways and Means Committee agreed Wednesday to renew for
three years a tax benefit for employees who receive educational
assistance from their bosses, and to extend for one year a special
credit for owners of low-income rental housing.
   The panel, working on a package of miscellaneous tax items
proposed by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is considering
extension of a third special benefit: tax-exempt mortgage bonds
used to help low-income people buying their first home.
   That exemption is a favorite of state and local government
officials, who administer the mortgage assistance. The General
Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, says the program
``does little to increase home ownership opportunities.''
   About $50 billion of such bonds were issued between 1982 and
1986, at a cost to the federal government of about $7.5 billion,
GAO estimated. About two-thirds of the homebuyers who benefited
could have bought their homes without assistance, the agency said.
   Congress wiped out several such special-interest benefits when
it revised the tax law two years ago, contending that the tax
system should not be used to provide subsidies when federal
appropriations could do the job better. But several still remain.
   The committee hopes to complete work next week on this year's
tax bill, which is designed mainly to correct hundreds of errors
that found their way into the 1986 law. The ``technical
corrections'' bill is being used as the vehicle for a few
substantive tax amendments, including those proposed by
Rostenkowski.
   The committee, meeting behind closed doors, voted Wednesday to:
   _Tighten and renew through 1990 an expired law under which
employees could avoid tax on up to $5,250 a year worth of
educational assistance provided by their employers. The benefit was
designed to help lower-income workers prepare for better jobs.
   Under the new version, the exclusion would be reduced as income
rises above a level that is yet to be determined, and upper-income
workers would receive no benefit. No benefit would be available for
post-graduate work. The Reagan administration opposes renewal of
the exclusion, which would cost the government about $540 million.
   _Extend for one year the credit for owners of low-income rental
housing, which is due to expire at the end of 1989. This would cost
$543 million.
   _Write into law an Internal Revenue Service decision that sick
pay, accumulated vacation leave and similar compensation received
by employees of state and local governments and non-profit
organizations should not be taxed when earned.
   _Exempt from Social Security taxes the wages of members of Amish
and other religious sects that have religious objections to such
programs. Committee aides estimated this would affect about 10,000
workers; about 750 self-employed people _ most of them Amish _
already are exempt.
   _Deny Social Security benefits to any person who in the future
is ordered deported as a Nazi war criminal.
   _Exempt from taxation a $10-million trust fund created in 1985
to finance rehabilitation of Enjebi Island in the Enewetak Atoll,
which the United States used as a target for testing nuclear
weapons in the 1940s and 1950s. A similar exemption was voted in
1982 for the benefit of Bikini Island.
   The biggest portion of the tax increase required to pay for the
benefits in the bill would come from corporations that own shares
of other corporations and from owners of single-premium life
insurance.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Blocks Billions in Pension Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local governments and other private
employers have received some welcome news from the Supreme Court in
a decision that could save them billions of dollars in pension
benefits.
   The court on Wednesday used a case from Florida to limit the
application of two previous rulings, which bar sex discrimination,
in determining retirement benefits.
   ``We're very happy and very pleased,'' said Andy McMullian,
director of Florida's division of retirement. ``We really thought
they would rule in our favor all along and that's why we took it to
the Supreme Court.''
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said Florida taxpayers do not have
to pay $43.6 million to male state workers who retired between
March 24, 1972, and Aug. 1, 1983.
   The court said that it would be unfair to retroactively apply
the anti-discrimination principles the court first established in a
1978 ruling and greatly expanded in 1983.
   Imposing such extra costs on pension plans would threaten their
existence and, therefore, the rights of other workers to collect
benefits, the court said.
   A U.S. Labor Department study estimates that the ruling will
save public and private employers nationwide from $817 million to
$1.26 billion a year well into the next century.
   The court in 1978 barred employers from requiring women to make
higher contributions to pension plans based on their generally
longer lifespans, even though as a group they receive more
retirement benefits as a result.
   In 1983, the court made it illegal for women to receive smaller
monthly retirement pay than men based on life expectancy when
employees of both sexes contributed equal amounts. That ruling took
effect Aug. 1, 1983.
   Both pension benefit rulings were based on the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 banning sex discrimination in the work place.
   Until Wednesday, the court had not said whether the sex-neutral
principles it established in the pension cases apply to a vast
number of workers who retired sometime between 1964 and 1983.
   The justices said Wednesday that employers, such as the Florida
government, should not be penalized for failing to eliminate all
sex-based pension options after the court's 1978 ruling.
   That decision failed to place employers on notice that all
pension options taking gender into account were illegal, the court
said.
   Some options in the Florida state retirement plan continued to
use sex-based mortality rates until 1983.
   The state was sued by male workers on behalf of themselves and
their wives, who also were beneficiaries of the pension plan. They
said their benefits were reduced illegally because of the use of
the sex-based life expectancy figures.
   Lower courts ruled in their favor and ordered the state to pay
an additional $43.6 million in benefits to them.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Upheld by a 6-3 vote the way Texas courts administer that
state's death penalty law, dashing the hopes of about 260 death row
inmates.
   _Split 5-4 in upholding an Oklahoma man's murder conviction and
death sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to
exclude one potential juror. The juror was disqualified when the
defendant's lawyer used one of the defense's limited number of
automatic challenges.
   _Ruled, 8-1, in a case from Denver that federal judges may not
throw out an indictment because of a prosecutor's misconduct unless
the defendant can show there would have been no indictment without
such misconduct.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Drug and Alcohol Testing For Rail Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation requiring the nation's railroad
workers to undergo random drug testing has begun to make progress
in the election-year conscious House.
   The House transportation, tourism and hazardous materials
subcommittee voted 13-0 on Wednesday to send the measure to the
full Energy and Commerce Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., who has been reluctant to support the
measure, is now expected to give the legislation prompt
consideration.
   ``I expect it to be called up right away,'' said Rep. Thomas A.
Luken, D-Ohio, the subcommittee chairman, after his panel approved
the bill.
   Luken co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Bob Whittaker of
Kansas, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, who said public
support for ridding drug and alcohol abuse from the transportation
industry is ``simply overwhelming.''
   There has been growing support in Congress for drug testing
legislation since Jan. 4, 1987, when an Amtrak passenger train and
three Conrail locomotives collided in Chase, Md. The crash killed
16 people and injured 175 others, and two Conrail crewmen have
admitted to having smoked marijuana shortly before the disaster.
   Railroad labor officials have opposed proposals for random
testing, saying that the procedures would violate the privacy of
the workers and unfairly threaten their careers because of the risk
of inaccurate laboratory analysis.
   That opposition has been diminishing, however, as election-year
pressures have increased for lawmakers to do something about drug
abuse. In addition, the Federal Railroad Administration proposed
drug testing rules for railroad workers on May 5 that many union
leaders consider harsher than the legislation.
   The bill would require not only random testing, which supporters
say would deter alcohol and drug abuse, but testing after
accidents, before hiring, for reasonable cause and as a part of
annual physical examinations.
   Workers who test positive would be given a second, more
sophisticated test to confirm the results. If they test positive
again, they would be suspended without pay and required to complete
rehabilitation programs to keep their jobs. Employees who refuse to
take tests would risk being fired.
   Procedures would be established to certify the laboratories
being used and to protect workers against harassment.
   Luken, who had long expressed fears about erroneous test
results, resisted introducing legislation until June 3. That was
five weeks after Dr. Roger Horn of Hunt Valley, Md., whose daughter
Ceres, 16, was killed in the Chase crash, visited newspapers and
television and radio stations in Luken's Cincinnati district to
argue that random testing was needed.
   The Senate has already approved legislation that would require
random drug and alcohol testing for railroad, airline and trucking
industry workers.
   Rail workers involved in accidents are already subject to drug
and alcohol tests, but those rules are being challenged in court.

<HEAD>EPA Asks 10 States To Develop Aldicarb Management Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under a new proposal, 10 states in the upper
Midwest, Northeast and Southeast are going to have to tell the
Environmental Protection Agency how they will protect ground water
from contamination with the highly toxic pesticide aldicarb.
   In its first action under a draft strategy aimed at protecting
ground water from pesticides, the EPA said Wednesday that it was
considering an alternative that would require ``pesticide
management plans'' from as many as 24 states.
   Only the 10 states in the main proposal, chosen on the basis of
their crops and the general vulnerability of ground water, were
identified: Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Dakota, Georgia, Alabama,
Maine, New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Florida.
   In the first five, aldicarb has not been found in ground water;
in the second five, it has been found in concentrations above 10
parts per billion, which is the amount the EPA considers safe.
   Ground water, which supplies drinking water to half the nation's
population, was once thought safe from pollution. But evidence to
the contrary has accumulated in recent years. The EPA has found 63
pesticides in ground water.
   The agency reported that one-third of about 35,000 ground water
samples it tested contained some aldicarb.
   Aldicarb, sold under the trade name Temik by Rhone-Poulenc Ag
Co. of Research Triangle Park, N.C., is used on potatoes, citrus,
peanuts, cotton and other crops to protect them against scores of
insects, root worms and mites. As much as 5.7 million pounds of the
pesticide are used each year.
   Its use already is restricted, and it is banned in a few areas
like Suffolk County on New York's Long Island, where 3,100 homes
must use expensive charcoal filtration to remove it from their well
water.
   In humans, aldicarb can interfere with the transmission of nerve
impulses. High concentrations can cause digestive upset,
dehydration, blurred vision, disorientation, seizures,
unconsciousness and death.
   More than 1,000 poisonings and two stillbirths were reported in
Western states and Canada in 1985 from California-grown watermelons
contaminated with aldicarb.
   The EPA has been studying the pesticide for four years, and
still is investigating how much might be in typical diets. The
manufacturer said Wednesday its latest survey showed ``residues
were rarely present.''
   The agency's draft strategy leaves many key decisions to the
states, like banning aldicarb's use in certain areas and limiting
frequency of application. John A. Moore, assistant EPA
administrator for pesticides, told reporters Wednesday that the
agency probably would ban use of aldicarb in states that refuse to
submit plans.
   States might win EPA approval to permit contamination of ground
water that wouldn't be used for drinking water, he said, as long as
residents of the state have had a chance to comment on the plan.
   Moore said the EPA also is proposing to ban aldicarb use within
300 feet of any well and to require state training programs for
applicators to teach about ground water effects.
   Rhone-Poulenc said in a statement that the EPA's proposal
reflects ``sound principles for drinking water protection,'' and
said it would cooperate.
   A company spokesman, Steve Schmotzer, said, ``We are going to
manage this product even more stringently than required, as we are
doing in some instances now.''
   In some counties in Florida, he said, the company requires
1,000-foot well protection zones. Elsewhere, though, 50 feet might
suffice, and Rhone-Poulenc might seek a variable zone in comments
to the EPA, Schmotzer said.
   Jay Feldman, coordinator of the National Campaign Against the
Misuse of Pesticides, criticized the EPA for not considering
non-chemical strategies, such as crop rotations, in calculating the
costs and benefits of aldicarb use.
   In addition to the five states from which EPA wants management
plans, aldicarb also has been found in California, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Virgina in
concentrations above 10 ppb, and in Arizona, Arkansas, Oregon,
Texas and Washington in concentrations below that.
   The EPA's proposal also would require Rhone-Poulenc to monitor
ground water the agency considers highly vulnerable in Connecticut,
Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota and Vermont.

says he's afraid there will be a dangerous overreaction by Congress
and the public to disclosures of a massive Pentagon fraud and
bribery investigation.
   ``You don't close a bank because there's been a bank robbery,''
Weinberger said in an interview Wednesday.
   ``And you don't conclude that we don't need a strong defense
because of the actions of some faithless employees. It's important
to bear in mind that the needs of defense haven't changed at all as
a result of these stories.''
   Weinberger also said that he had no apologies to make for his
management style while serving as secretary of defense. He said he
didn't know about the federal investigation until it was revealed
last week. Nor, he said, did he have any suspicions of wrongdoing
before he left office last November.
   ``I think the (contract) procedures in effect are proper,'' the
former defense chief and presidential confidant said.
   ``We needed to regain military strength quickly and we did. But
I didn't exercise any hands-off management technique. I had
briefings regularly, once a week or every two weeks, on the major
weapons programs.
   ``But no matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able
to eliminate dishonesty.''
   Weinberger served almost seven years as secretary of defense
before stepping down because of the ill health of his wife.
According to the Justice Department, the ongoing fraud and bribery
probe began during his tenure and involved, at least to some
extent, contracting actions that occurred before his departure.
   Justice Department officials say the inquiry centers on
allegations that Pentagon executives took bribes from private
military consultants who were seeking classified contract
information for their clients.
   Weinberger insisted he had seen nothing in news reports about
the FBI investigation to call into question the contracting rules
and regulations used by the Pentagon. He also complained that talk
of scandal was prompting lawmakers to twist facts about the
administration's performance.
   ``We need to keep a sense of proportion without jumping to
conclusions,'' he said. ``The Pentagon awards 52,000 contracts
every single day, and inevitably there may be some faithless or
dishonest people.
   ``Now, a lot of totally incorrect statements are being made in
the heat of battle. Sen. (Charles) Grassley (R-Iowa) said 6 percent
of defense contracts are awarded competitively. It's really 60
percent. Sixty percent of the contracts by dollar value. It's 82
percent by number of contract actions.''
   Weinberger's defense of the Pentagon came just one day after
President Reagan offered similar observations, saying bribery and
fraud were ``understandable'' within the huge bureaucracy of the
Pentagon and that no one could keep track of all defense employees
and military contractors.
   While echoing those views, Weinberger made clear he did not
condone the misconduct.
   ``I don't have any hesitancy in saying anyone found guilty of
bribing or receiving bribes or giving out classified information
ought to be administered full punishment,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Pentagon Fraud May Be Scandal Both Parties Can
Love</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the defense lawyers in the burgeoning
Pentagon contract-fraud investigation suggests, not entirely in
jest, that this could become the most politically popular scandal
in years.
   ``This is the best thing that's happened to both the Republicans
and Democrats in six months, because for the Republicans it gets
everybody's mind off (Attorney General) Ed Meese and for the
Democrats it gets everybody's mind off (House Speaker) Jim
Wright,'' said this lawyer, who was not interested in having his or
his client's name further publicized.
   ``So what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both
parties to try to pump it up. You've got a Republican, (Iowa Sen.
Charles) Grassley, who's pumping it up, and you've got the
Democrats too'' including Sens. David Pryor of Arkansas and Sam
Nunn of Georgia, and Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the lawyer added.
All four have joined the public outcry over the affair.
   ``It's the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets
reporters off their leadership,'' the lawyer said. ``It's terrific,
a perfect opportunity.''
   This experienced attorney is among a dozen Washington lawyers
already hired by contractors, consultants and Pentagon officials
who are named in government search warrants or grand jury subpoenas.
   He was giving his admittedly self-interested view of how
government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable
publicity for their side of the case through leaks, speeches and
news conferences even before bringing any charges or making any
arrests.
   Meese, who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to
discuss ongoing investigations in public, even held a news
conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut
Grassley's complaints that the Justice Department had moved too
slowly.
   Since the government's coordinated searches on June 14, the
Pentagon story has muscled two high-profile investigations off the
nation's front pages: the special prosecutor's imminent report on
whether Meese used his office to benefit himself and friends, and a
House ethics investigation of Democratic Speaker Jim Wright's
finances and official actions.
   The well-known names Meese and Wright have been replaced by
those of Pentagon bureaucrats, private consultants and contractors
who are hardly household words _ Berlin, Galvin, Gunn, Lackner,
Paisley, Parkin and others.
   Even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by Justice
Department or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to
investigators are not the best known on Capitol Hill _ Democrats
William Chappell Jr. of Florida; Roy Dyson of Maryland; Thomas J.
Downey and Samuel S. Stratton, both of New York; and Republican
Andy Ireland of Florida.
   Aides to those five point out that even the leakers don't say
they're under investigation at this time. Federal prosecutor Henry
Hudson publicly says no one on the Hill is now a target.
   This is as close as a Washington scandal comes to catnip for
politicians. As Texas GOP chairman George Strake told the Dallas
Times Herald, ``Every morning when I wake up, I run out to get the
paper and see what the scandal of the day is, whether it's on them
or us.''
   The defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those
tempted to translate leaks and FBI search warrant affidavits into
automatic convictions.
   ``It's a specific federal crime if you trade inside information
on Wall Street, but there is a sensitive information flow between
the Pentagon and its contractors that is not only legal but even
encouraged. Only in certain circumstances is that illegal,'' he
said.
   The leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as
government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and
office conversations. But this lawyer, who has heard similar
government tapes before, said, ``They may not have tapes that are
that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal
depending on the intent involved.''
   ``The tapes may have showed a need to check further,'' the
lawyer said. But he emphasized that further investigation is just
beginning with last week's massive seizure of records and the
efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate.
   Even if the leakers are correct, he said, ``this would be dozens
of separate, small conspiracies that take time to investigate _ not
one, big conspiracy.'' All the search warrants were done together
so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved
in separate, similar schemes to begin shredding their documents.
   Based on his experience, this lawyer said, ``The people
hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least. The
ones who know the most don't talk at this stage.''

<HEAD>Weeks Before Farm Drought Aid Bill to be Ready</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional advocates of providing income
guarantees for America's drought-plagued farmers concede that it
will take weeks just to fashion a bill, let alone push it through
Congress.
   ``This is an ongoing process; nothing is set in stone,'' House
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
said Wednesday after a congressional task force approved broad
outlines of a drought-relief package.
   The blueprint is short on specifics and bound to come in for
changes in weeks ahead. In fact, one feature _ to allow growing
oats on idled acreage _ was approved as part of the plan, then
quietly scuttled within the hour to keep peace with a skeptical
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   The general proposal calls for guaranteeing farm incomes but
leaves the contentious task of developing a formula for later.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
had said earlier that task force members should sit down and stay
in session until they worked out a blueprint for providing
assistance.
   He told the task force that at least some document was needed as
a sign to farmers that Congress means business about providing help.
   ``What I saw in the Northern Plains I never would have
believed,'' said Leahy, who headed a visit by six senators to
Montana and the Dakotas over the weekend. He also noted that beef
and pork prices are falling and he issued a sternly worded warning
to food companies not to raise consumer prices.
   Lyng told the task force that President Reagan did not mean to
express opposition to drought assistance when he said at a Toronto
news conference that there was little he could do about the
situation.
   Reagan merely ``exhibited some of the frustration that some of
the rest of us have that you can't do anything to make it rain,''
Lyng said. He said the president favors some form of assistance.
   ``I accept your explanation,'' de la Garza said.
   The task force called for speeded-up action by the Agriculture
Department to allow farmers in drought-stricken counties to obtain
92 percent of their normal ``deficiency payments,'' even if they
are prevented by drought from planting.
   Such a measure would come under the department's ``zero-92''
program, which ordinarily permits farmers to plant none of their
acreage and still receive 92 percent of the payments.
   Deficiency payments are income supports representing the
difference between market prices and target prices set by Congress
and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture.
   The group urged ``maximum flexibility'' in applying a rule that
farmers must plant so-called cover crops, such as grasses, on lands
idled for conservation purposes. Sizeable amounts of land are idled
for such purposes under provisions of the 1985 farm law that sought
not only to prevent erosion but to take land out of production to
combat surpluses.
   Other task force recommendations:
   _A search for ways to make sure producers will have sufficient
herds to resume livestock breeding when the drought is over.
Breeders are selling off stock because of lack of feed.
   _Development of ways to expand participation in the federal crop
insurance program.
   _Use of all authority provided under last year's bailout bill
for the Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of lending
institutions, to restructure loan payments for farmers hard hit by
drought.
   _Emergency loans for farmers if conditions worsen.
   Leahy and other task force members have been saying that a spate
of election-year drought aid bills would not help in passing an aid
package. But two Michigan lawmakers pushed ahead Wednesday, saying
there was no reason to delay.
   Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., and Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich.,
introduced a measure that would use in-kind payments to repay
farmers up to 50 percent of drought losses. Traxler said his
measure had no dollar limit and might not be the one that ends up
passing but added that some form of aid would do so.
   He said the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep.
Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., will make certain that an aid measure wins
approval.
   ``Jamie Whitten has never met a disaster that he didn't
tackle,'' Traxler said, ``and I assure you that he will tackle this
one.''

   Thirty-six cars of train derailed and one
car filled with phosphorus burst into flames Wednesday night,
forcing 2,500 people to evacuate and bans on flights over four
counties, officials said.
   No injuries were reported, said Don Armstrong, spokesman for the
state Disaster and Emergency Services in Frankfort.
   He said a phosphorus fire cannot be quenched and must burn
itself out. Smoke from the fire could explode when temperatures
reach 90 degrees, he said.
   ``You're talking about big, big, big trouble,'' Armstrong said.
``Water makes it burn hotter.''
   The evacuation was ordered for residents of Nortonville, Graham
and White Plains downwind to the east of the burning car, which
derailed in Christian County near the Hopkin County line.
   The Federal Aviation Administration early Thursday restricted
all air travel over those counties and over Muhlenberg and McLean
counties. Two highways also were closed, officials said.
   The CSX train derailed at 7:55 p.m., 3{ miles north of Crofton,
a community of 800 in western Kentucky, state police said.
Armstrong said smoke from the fire could be seen up to 30 miles
away.
   No one in Crofton, population 800, was evacuated, said Novi
Mainire of the Crofton police department.
   Officials were unable to determine if other chemicals were being
transported on the train, but Armstrong said only one car was on
fire.
   CSX spokesman Ripley Watson said the 36 cars that derailed were
roughly in the middle of the 121-car train, which was traveling
from Nashville, Tenn., to Chicago.

<HEAD>Acne Drug Prevents Skin Cancer In People At High Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study published today shows that the acne
medicine Accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin
cancer in humans, but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for
routine use.
   Accutane, a vitamin A derivative that can cause birth defects in
pregnant women, sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of
people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited
genetic disorder, the study shows.
   While Accutane cannot be taken for long periods by most people,
other synthetic forms of vitamin A may someday be routinely used to
prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years
of exposure to the sun, the researchers said.
   In addition, vitamin A drugs may someday be used to treat other
tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the lung, stomach,
colon, bladder, cervix and breast, said Dr. Harley Haynes of
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   ``The odds are that within the lifetime of many people, we may
well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer
in high-risk people,'' he said.
   The treatment is an example of the young field of
chemoprevention. Until now, medicines have been given almost
exclusively to attack cancers once they occur rather than to
prevent them from forming.
   ``This is the first study that has scientifically proven in
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said Dr.
Howard Koh of the Boston University School of Medicine. ``We use
sun screens because they should work, but we still have not
rigorously proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be
prevented with that method.''
   However, he cautioned that the study, conducted on just five
people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer.
   The study was directed by Dr. Kenneth H. Kraemer at the National
Cancer Institute and published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   About 500,000 Americans are treated each year for basal cell and
squamous cell skin cancer, the most common forms of cancer. These
tumors, which are usually curable, occur most frequently in
light-skinned people exposed to too much sun.
   ``You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the
beginning,'' said Kraemer. ``But if that isn't the case, this is an
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression
of the damage to cancer.''
   Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is widely used to
clear up severe acne. Because of its possible danger for pregnant
women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month ordered its
maker, Hoffman-La Roche, to warn customers by printing a picture of
a deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   In the cancer study, high doses were taken by five people with
xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare disorder in which the body is unable
to repair genetic damage caused by sunlight.
   In the two years before taking Accutane, the patients studied
had a total of 121 cancerous tumors. While on the drug, they had
25. When the drug was stopped, they had nearly a nine-fold increase
in the frequency of tumors.
   However, two people had to drop out of the study because of side
effects. One had high levels of blood fats, while the other showed
signs of liver abnormalities.
   Kraemer said that high doses of Accutane may be warranted for
some people who have frequent skin cancers because of their
lifelong exposure to the sun, ``but for the general population,
it's much too toxic.''
   More than 2,000 similar vitamin A compounds already exist, and
some of them may be safe and effective enough to protect ordinary
people from skin cancers, scientists say.

   If there are fewer cherries to bake into pies
this fall, part of the blame can be put on the drought.
   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that production of
tart cherries is expected to drop 41 percent from last year'
harvest of 358.5 million pounds to 211 million pounds. In Michigan,
the largest producer, the crop was estimated at 150 million pounds,
down 43 percent from 1987.
   Severe spring freezes, drought and a high fruit dropoff in June
were blamed for the decline in Michigan production. And rain is
needed ``within the next few weeks'' for the remaining cherries to
grow properly, the report said.
   Production in the four leading states accounts for about 94
percent of this year's expected tart cherry production. Others
include: New York, 23 million pounds, down from 35 million in 1987;
Utah, 15 million, down from 29 million; and Wisconsin, 9 million,
down from 14 million.
   The crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 175,400 tons, down 17
percent from last year's harvest of 210,800 tons.
   Department officials say sweet cherry output in the Western
states is mostly quoted by the ton, while Eastern practice favors
pounds. Since most production is in the West, the agency reports
sweet cherries in tons.
   The top four producers of sweet cherries in this year's forecast
are: California, 32,000 tons, down from 45,000 last year; Michigan,
22,000, down from 32,000; Oregon, 45,000, down from 50,000; and
Washington, 67,000, down from 74,000.

   One-time Democratic presidential contender
Joseph Biden has endorsed likely Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis, nine months after a Dukakis aide circulated an ``attack
video'' that helped push Biden out of the race.
   Biden, a U.S. senator from Delaware, telephoned Dukakis from his
home, Biden's office said Wednesday. Dukakis has a mathematical
lock on the nomination.
   The Dukakis campaign reacted to the call with satisfaction.
   ``Obviously we are delighted,'' said campaign spokesman Mark
Gearan, who praised the Delaware senator as ``someone who has
national stature and has gained a reputation in the Senate as a
leader and a fighter.''
   ``His reputation as an effective and forceful leader on foreign
policy, on education and other domestic issues is something that we
feel can be a tremendous help to our campaign,'' Gearan said.
   Biden, who is recovering from brain surgery, assured the
Massachusetts governor that he would work on his behalf when he
returns to the Senate later this year, his office said.
   Biden's office said the senator told Dukakis he was ``very
confident the Democrats will win back the White House and retain
control of the Senate in November.''
   Biden ended his quest for the presidency on Sept. 23, 1987,
after a week in which his campaign was rocked by admissions of
plagiarism and of false claims about his academic record.
   He was also criticized for lifting sections of other
politicians' speeches without attribution. A videotape, juxtaposing
a Biden campaign speech with a speech by British politician Neil
Kinnock and showing striking similarities between the two, was sent
to various news organizations.
   Biden said he had credited Kinnock on other occasions, but had
neglected to do so that time.
   It was later revealed that John Sasso, Dukakis' campaign
manager, distributed the video. One day after news reports linked
the Dukakis campaign to the video, the Massachusetts governor
admitted that Sasso was the source of the video. Sasso resigned
from the campaign, as did Paul Tully, Dukakis' campaign issues
director.
   Biden, 45, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was
released from the hospital last month after successful surgery to
correct an aneurysm near his brain. It was the second aneurysm he
had suffered since February.
   An aneurysm is a ballooning of the weakened wall of an artery
and is caused by disease or injury.

<HEAD>Consultants: Tearing Down Part Of Moscow Chancery `An Engineering
Nightmare'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consultants hired by the State Department have
concluded that to tear down a portion of the new U.S. Embassy
chancery in Moscow would be an ``engineering nightmare,'' according
to a report published today.
   Members of Congress and intelligence officers disclosed last
year that the unfinished building was riddled with Soviet listening
devices.
   The State Department asked a team of engineers, architects and
security experts to study the structure and analyze solutions for
making it secure.
   The consultants, in their initial finding, have concluded that
``partial deconstruction'' of the eight-story building ``isn't
feasible'' and would be more dangerous and difficult than
demolishing the entire the structure and rebuilding, The New York
Times reported today.
   One of the consultants referred to ``an engineering nightmare,''
the Times said.
   The new chancery was to have been the main embassy building for
diplomatic and classified activities. But after $22 million was
spent on it, construction was stopped in 1985.
   A State Department source told The Associated Press the
department has received a portion of the consultants' report, but
the complete report is not due until August. The source said no
decision on what to do about the building has been made.
   Robert E. Lamb, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic
security, told the Times, ``The building experts are saying that a
partial deconstruction isn't feasible, because it is very difficult
to take a portion of the building and build on the existing
structure.''
   ``Just from the efficiency of the construction, you're better
off taking the whole thing down,'' Lamb added.
   The current embassy, which the United States occupied in the
early 1950s, consists of one building. It's undergoing a $32.5
million renovation.

   The telephone company is instituting a new
exchange for ``dial-a-porn'' and party-line services that will be
available to customers only upon request, in a twist on efforts to
keep youngsters from having access to the services.
   Industry spokesmen say the new exchange could drive the services
out of business in Maryland.
   ``It will infringe on the rights of people who like this
entertainment,'' said Jonathon Golan, who provides two programs of
adult entertainment on 976 lines in Baltimore. ``Their rights will
be violated because (the new service) requires identification.''
   The Maryland Public Service Commission has approved Chesapeake
and Potomac's request to institute the new exchange for all adult
and conversation-line services, which have been available on 976
numbers.
   The new 915 exchange, expected to be implemented by the end of
the summer, will be accessible only by customers who have notified
the company they want to have access to it, said Al Burman, a
spokesman for Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co.
   Maryland is the first state to approve the subscription exchange
for dial-a-porn lines, Burman said. Sports lines, financial
services and other information lines will remain on 976 exhanges,
he said.
   ``It would essentially wipe out the vast majority of the 976
industry,'' charged Brad Woodward, treasurer of the Mid-Atlantic
Audiotex Association. Woodward describes the group as a loose-knit
organization of about 175 services in the
Baltimore-Washington-Philadelphia area.
   Callers to many 976 programs, such as teen party lines,
dial-a-date lines or other conversation lines, make the call on
impulse, Woodward said. The change to a subscription-type service
would eliminate those ``spontaneous-response'' callers, he said.
   Under the telephone company's plan, a customer wishing to obtain
access to the 915 lines would have to sign a consent form. Names of
those signing the forms would be kept confidential.
   Customers now can request that access from their phone be
blocked to certain 976 numbers. The new system will work in
reverse, providing the 915 service only to those people who
specifically request it by signing the form, Burman said.
   Across the country, ``dial-a-porn'' and party line services have
drawn criticisms from some who complain that they are too easily
accessible by children who have in some cases run up huge bills
without their parents' knowledge.
   ``The purpose is to provide customers increased control over
which services would be accessed from their telephone service and
to minimize billing disputes with customers,'' Burman said.
   One provider of 976 service in the Baltimore area thinks the
change will have a positive effect on telephone information
services.
   ``I think it's the best thing for it,'' said Joseph Katz, who
operates the International 976 Group in Baltimore, which operates
information services but no dial-a-porn lines. ``You're going to
have more people who are going to come into the
information-providing area. They're not thinking (976 service) is
going out of business. I think they've done away with the
objectionable part of it.''
   Katz agreed that the subscription service could eliminate
billing disputes. ``There's no excuse for somebody to say they
didn't know what they were getting,'' he said. ``They signed up.''
   But Golan contended that the adult-oriented business will suffer
because people won't want to be identified as a subscriber to 915.
``It's a very touchy issue, and it's being approached in a very
negative way,'' he said.
   Tony Parker, an attorney for the Mid-Atlantic Audiotex
Association, said the group is considering legal action to block
the Public Service Commission's decision.
   The commission is using the 915 service to drive dial-a-porn
lines from the marketplace, Parker said, adding, ``What they're
doing is doing indirectly what they can't do directly.''
   Annual revenue from 976-type services is about $330 million
nationwide, according to the Information Industry Bulletin, an
industry newsletter. Of that, about $54 million is from
``dial-a-porn'' lines; $90 million from conference conversation
lines; and $186 million from general-interest lines, such as
recorded sports results.

<HEAD>Bush Talks Tough On Crime To Sheriffs Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says the U.S.
judicial system is being ``held hostage'' by politicians and judges
who get their legal views from the American Civil Liberties Union.
   That line won a round of applause from the audience of sheriffs.
But at least one member of the audience _ a supporter of Democrat
Michael Dukakis _ called Bush's positions ``simplistic.''
   Sheriff Robert C. Rufo of Suffolk County, Mass., claimed Bush's
tough talk on fighting crime is ``no more than a Republican
smokescreen to divert attention from where they are weak.''
   Rufo was in the audience on Wednesday as Bush delivered a
strongly worded law-and-order speech to the National Sheriff's
Association. He dismissed some of the vice president's views on
crime as ``complete idiocy.''
   Bush was spending today in Washington with no public appearances
scheduled. However, aides said he planned to meet at breakfast with
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick.
   Kirkpatrick is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate
for Bush if he decides to name a woman to his ticket.
   However, Bush spokeswoman Shelia Tate said there was no
indication of what Bush and Kirkpatrick would discuss, and the vice
president on Wednesday reiterated that he had not yet begun to
consider any specific individuals for the No. 2 spot on the
Republican ticket.
   At the same time, Bush made light of recent polls showing far
more support for him among men than among women voters.
   ``You hear a lot about the gender gap,'' Bush told local
interviewers. ``What you do is spell out your positions on the
issues and the gender gap goes away and you win the election.
That's what happened in 1984 and that's exactly what I want to have
happen in 1988.''
   In his speech to the sheriffs, Bush attacked Dukakis without
naming him in what the vice president billed as a non-partisan
address.
   ``For too many years, we've been held hostage by well-meaning
but misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from
the ACLU,'' Bush said, a reference to the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   The ACLU often takes unpopular positions in representing
individuals or organizations it contends have been deprived of
their constitutional rights.
   Later, Bush told reporters that Dukakis had called himself ``a
card-carrying member of the ACLU.''
   ``That was a quote of his. That is not exactly the mainstream of
Kentucky politics,'' the vice president said.
   Bush reiterated his support for the death penalty for major drug
dealers and for drug-related deaths, but said he would not advocate
such a penalty for those convicted of drunken driving in a fatal
accident.
   ``I draw the line there,'' he told reporters.
   Bush also took another swipe at what is becoming a favorite
target: the since-abandoned Massachusetts program for prison
furloughs under which some convicted first-degree murderers were
let out of prison on weekend passes.
   ``The view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not just
naive, it's dead wrong,'' Bush told the sheriffs' organization.
   ``When first-degree murderers sentenced to life without parole
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences, that
view goes from naive to dangerous, from well-meaning to
irresponsible,'' Bush said.
   Bush recounted details of the case of Willy Horton, a convicted
Massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and
accused of raping a woman while he was free.
   Sheriff Rufo, who is the president of the Massachusetts
Sheriffs' Association, told reporters that ``there were 121,000
successful furloughs before that incident.''
   Rufo said that Dukakis inherited but did not initiate the prison
furlough program and now opposes allowing first-degree murderers
out of prison on weekend leave, just as Bush does.
   ``He shares the vice president's views on furloughs,'' said
Rufo, who wore a Dukakis campaign button to the event.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Jackson Receiving ``Very Serious Consideration''</HEAD>

   Michael Dukakis ducked questions about whether
Jesse Jackson would be a liability on the Democratic ticket, while
the search for a running mate picked up steam.
   Campaign sources said Jackson _ along with Florida Sen. Bob
Graham, Ohio Sen. John Glenn and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn _ had been
asked to submit background and financial information, and House
Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington was being asked as well.
   The soliciting of such information from potential running mates
indicates interest on the part of the Dukakis campaign.
   But at least one potential running mate moved to take himself
out of the running.
   Nick Donatiello, a spokesman for New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
said Wednesday the senator had ``made it absolutely clear, both
publicly and privately'' to Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas
that he was not interested. Brountas is heading the running-mate
search.
   Bradley's office has said it had not been asked to supply the
Dukakis campaign with background information. But Dukakis, asked if
that meant Bradley was not being considered, answered with a quick
``no.''
   The Massachusetts governor told reporters Wednesday that Jackson
would receive ``very serious consideration'' as his running mate
despite lacking government experience. Asked about surveys
suggesting Jackson could hurt the Democratic ticket, Dukakis
sidestepped.
   ``I'm not going to be checking a lot of polls, believe me. ...
We all have our strengths and our weaknesses.''
   On the matter of Jackson's qualifications, Dukakis said: ``I
don't know that you have to have held public office to in fact be
qualified.''
   But, he added, ``It helps.''
   In general, Dukakis was unwilling to say much about the search
for his running mate.
   ``I don't think it's helpful ... to do it with press conferences
at the end of the driveway every time you talk to somebody,'' he
said. ``We've just begun the process.''
   The probable Democratic nominee today was visiting a day-care
center in southeastern Massachusetts, continuing his attempt to
focus on issues he trumpets on the campaign trial.
   Dukakis picked up the endorsement Wednesday of Sen. Joseph Biden
of Delaware, who exited the presidential race shortly after
Dukakis' top aide, John Sasso, distributed a videotape showing
Biden had lifted rhetoric from a British politician without
attributing the remarks.
   On another front, Dukakis continued to defend himself against
Republican George Bush's attacks on a Massachusetts furlough
program that allowed for the release of a murderer who then escaped
while on furlough and raped a Maryland woman.
   Dukakis said he had since tightened eligibility requirements for
furloughs to exclude first-degree murderers, and said 45 states and
the federal government have some form of furlough system.
   He said Bush was focusing on the furlough-escape case because he
had no record of his own to promote on crime issues.

<HEAD>Congressional Committee Looks For West Virginia Hunger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional committee is due in
West Virginia this week to investigate hunger in Appalachia, but a
debate already has begun over whether there's an ``underground''
army of starving people in the state.
   ``We are looking for declining food security in Appalachia,
where studies show the poor are getting poorer,'' said Timmie
Jensen, a staff worker for the U.S. House Select Committee On
Hunger.
   West Virginia was selected because all 55 counties of the
coal-mining state qualify as part of Appalachia, a committee
spokesman said. No other state bears that distinction.
   The committee plans hearings in Montgomery on Friday to listen
to food bank workers, community advocates and state welfare
officials talk about whether West Virginia's poor are being fed. A
few congressmen, led by Rep. Harley Staggers, D-W.Va., also will
visit the homes of three needy residents to hear their problems.
   ``There are 100,000 people in poverty in West Virginia who are
getting no aid,'' Jensen said Wednesday. ``It's ironic, considering
the federal food stamp program started in West Virginia, and we're
still not reaching all West Virginians.''
   Food stamps were introduced in West Virginia in 1961 under an
executive order by President John F. Kennedy. The state, third in
the nation in unemployment, ``really illustrates the problems of
the poor,'' Jensen said.
   West Virginia's poverty rate is 22.3 percent, versus the
national average of 18.1 percent for rural areas, Staggers said.
Joblessness has run as high as 44 percent in some southern
coalfield counties during the past five years, and the state has
led the nation in unemployment for much of the decade. Unemployment
now is at 7.4 percent by state calculations and 9.7 percent by
federal figures.
   The committee wants to find out whether the rural poor can feed
themselves using food stamps, or must rely on other sources for
food, Jensen said.
   ``If they have to go to food pantries and kitchens, that is
extraordinary means,'' she said.
   Last month, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
Washington-based liberal watchdog group, reported that nearly a
fourth of West Virginians live in poverty, and that fewer than a
third of the state's jobless receive unemployment benefits.
   ``I have a hard time sustaining that,'' Gov. Arch Moore retorted
shortly after the study was released. He said his Department of
Human Services reports a reduction in the number of people
receiving welfare benefits.
   ``How do these people live?'' Moore asked. ``There's some that
talk about there being an underground around here some place. I'm
hard-pressed to figure out where that data base is coming from.''
   Moore's press aide, John Price, said the governor ``obviously is
concerned about poverty in West Virginia'' but said many of the
studies on the state exaggerate the problem.
   ``If that's true, I'd like to know why we're increasing our food
distribution by about 400,000 pounds a year,'' said Carla Knicely,
director of the Mountaineer Food Bank, which distributes donated
groceries to 225 food pantries and kitchens throughout West
Virginia.
   The operation and two affiliates in Huntington and Coal Mountain
distributed 3.2 million pounds of food in 1987, Knicely said.
   ``If they aren't hungry, it's because the food pantries are
feeding them,'' Knicely said. ``I would say the problem goes into
malnutrition here _ not starvation. But there are hungry children.''
   Appalachian Research and Defense Fund director Milton Ogle said
federal hunger programs have ``come close to eliminating severe
malnutrition'' he saw in rural states in the 1960s. ``But there's
still a lot of hunger around.''
   Ogle said he is concerned that monthly food stamp allotments are
not enough to feed participants, and ``they have to do what they
call `beaning it' _ eat nothing but beans _ the last week or so.''

   Iranian soldiers arrested ``hundreds'' of
drug smugglers and users and seized more than 1,100 pounds of opium
and heroin in a two-day sweep, Tehran Radio reported.
   The station said Revolutionary Guards in Tehran province began
an anti-drug operation on Monday and seozed 1,089 pounds of opium,
66 pounds of opium extract and more than eight pounds of heroin,
said the report.
   The soldiers also got three revolvers and five million riyals
($74,009) in cash. The radio said a ``large number''of drug
smuggling gangs had been ``smashed.''
   Iran's fundamentalist regime has cracked down harshly on drugs
smugglers and users since it came to power in 1979 and outlawed
cultivation of poppy plants.

   The $25 million Richard M. Nixon
Presidential Library will be a classic-style building that will
blend with the surrounding neighborhood, according to plans.
   The library cleared two hurdles Tuesday with City Council
approval of the environmental report for the project and
designation of the ex-president's adjacent homestead as a historic
site.
   There was no public opposition or debate of the plans by Langdon
Wilson Mumper, a Los Angeles-based architectural firm. The plans
call for a classic revival, concrete and brick, U-shaped building
with a red tile roof to be built next to the wood frame house where
Nixon was born.
   The library is to be surrounded by gardens, a reflective pool,
fountains and 290 parking spaces.
   The city Planning Commission is scheduled next week to review
plans for the 84,500 square-foot, one-story complex.
Ground-breaking ceremonies are planned for November and the library
is scheduled to open in June 1989.
   Nixon, 75, has approved final details and a scale model of the
library. He is expected to attend groundbreaking at the site, about
30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   Wayne Bennett may be national president of
the American Soybean Association, but his lofty position offers him
no protection from the drought that has withered the nation's
farmlands.
   About one-third of Bennett's 1988 soybean crop hasn't been
planted because dry, powdery soil covers the Lonoke County farm he
purchased with his father more than four decades ago.
   The rest was planted ``so we'll have a head start in case it
does rain,'' Bennett said recently. ``You have to be optimistic or
you can't be a farmer.''
   Bennett's optimism turned to joy June 16 when a spotty series of
afternoon thundershowers bathed his soybean fields, located about
25 miles southeast of Little Rock.
   But the rain didn't last long. And Bennett, like most of his
association's 27,000 members in 26 states, is back to watching his
soil turn parched and pale.
   His advice to association members?
   ``Pray for rain,'' he said.

   Two critically ill Soviet refuseniks have been
told by the Soviet government they may soon be allowed to emigrate
after years of denials, relatives said Wednesday.
   The families of Benjamin Charny, 50, and Yuri Zieman, 49, have
been notified by the U.S. State Department that Soviet authorities
have withdrawn objections on national security grounds to allowing
the two men to leave .
   Leon Charny said Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights
Richard Schifter telephoned him Tuesday to say his brother's
eight-year battle for permission to emigrate may soon be over.
   ``I'm grateful, I'm happy and I want him out as soon as
possible,'' Charny said in a telephone interview from his Needham
home. ``My wish is that no family will have to go through what this
family has gone through.''
   ``I also got a call from the State Department,'' said Zieman's
daughter, Galina Khatusky, who emigrated to the United States in
June 1987. ``They told me the Soviets have no objection to my
father's leaving.''
   Zieman's daughter, Vera, had written President Reagan appealing
for help in the couple's 11-year wait for exit visas and the
Reagans considered visiting her home during the recent U.S.-Soviet
summit in Moscow.
   The visit reportedly was canceled after U.S. officials were
warned that a presidential stop would doom the family's chances to
emigrate.
   Charny and and Khatusky said neither of their relatives had been
officially granted permission to leave. But both said they believe
their release is just a matter of time.
   ``I trust the State Department,'' said Khatusky, who lives in
Brighton.
   The first indications the matter was about to be resolved came
Tuesday, when Soviet officials informally notified U.S. and other
Western diplomats that the Ziemans would soon be granted exit visas.
   The word reportedly was conveyed to Secretary of State George P.
Shultz by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubynin.
   Khatusky said she was told it would take about two weeks for the
Soviet Union to formally notify her parents and 12-year-old sister,
Vera, that they may leave the Soviet Union.
   Zieman, a computer specialist who lost his job when he applied
to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken several
months ago by a mysterious ailment that left him with double vision
and a loss of balance.
   The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as a
potentially deadly aneurysm, or bulge in a cerebral artery, made
the family's quest more urgent because Zieman was warned by his
doctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the
Soviet Union.
   Zieman had been told he is not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, though he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.
   ``He has severe brain disorders, we hope he can come here and be
examined properly,'' said Khatusky.
   Leon Charny, a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, said his brother has undergone surgery for a
cancerous growth on his back and recently suffered a heart attack.
   He also has what is believed to be benign tumor growing on the
back of his neck.
   In 1986, the New England Medical Center offerred Benjamin Charny
free medical care, Leon Charny said, adding that it's ``doubtless''
he can receive better medical help here than in the Soviet Union.
   Charny, a mathematician who worked for the Institute of
Automation and Instrument Making 17 years ago, had repeatedly been
denied exit visas on the grounds that he was privy to state secrets.
   His brother said a deputy director at the institute had
contacted his brother Tuesday to inform him he was ``no longer
considered a person who knows vital secrets, and that was the only
major obstacle to his way out.''

   A civic group has taken a novel approach
to supporting its local police by taking out a $1 million insurance
policy to cover the township's eight officers if they are killed in
the line of duty.
   The insurance idea came up after the deaths of two Will County
auxiliary deputies during a 1983 crime spree in Homer Township,
said James Clarage, president of the Homer Men for Responsible
Government.
   ``We really felt bad about what happened with that incident,''
Clarage said. ``There's nothing you can really do to offset
something like that. This was just something we felt obligated to
do to show that we were concerned.''
   In any future tragedy, he said, ``We wanted to make sure that it
wouldn't cause hardship ... to the families of officers.''
   The coverage, presented Wednesday to Will County Sheriff John
Johnsen, would provide up to $200,000 for families of each officer
killed and up to $1 million total. The policy took effect March 1.
   Dues from the 100-member social and civic organization are
paying the $3,000 annual premiums. The insurance applies to the
sheriff and the seven full-time deputies who patrol Homer Township,
a small unincorporated community of 20,000 residents located 30
miles southwest of Chicago.
   After a two-year search, the club got Lloyds of London to
provide the policy, State's Attorney Ed Masters said.
   Clarage said he contacted about a dozen insurance agents, while
local agent Samuel Maranto talked to more than 20 companies.
   ``Everybody said, `Oh, no problem,''' Clarage said. But later
the companies found they had no experience with civic groups buying
insurance for local police, and no policies were offered.
   ``This is a rather unique situation in their making this very
gracious and very heart-warming donation,'' Masters said. ``I think
that there's a need to protect police officers. They put their life
on the line.''
   Clarage said many families of slain officers get only $25,000 in
death benefits from government agencies.
   In July 1983, two people fatally shot a man and a woman who were
parked in a secluded area in the township. Two auxiliary deputies,
Steven Mayer, 22, and Dennis Foley, 50, responded to the shots and
were gunned down.
   The bloody rampage ended only after a fifth person was shot and
killed.
   Clarage said he's unsure how much money was given to the
deputies' families, but he believes the amounts were minimal.
   He suggested that many officers have a hard time getting life
insurance policies because of the nature of their work. Bob
Schultz, a spokesman for the Illinois Insurance Information
Service, said he was unaware of any problems.
   When a police officer is killed, people often take up private
collections, but there are limits to what can be raised, Clarage
said.
   ``My idea was, why not have them contribute, but do it ahead of
time, and do it in the form of purchasing some really meaningful
coverage,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Conferees Scale Back Military Role in Drug Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators working on a
Pentagon budget bill have scaled back plans for a major military
role in the anti-drug effort and have cut President Reagan's
request for Star Wars spending, sources said.
   The House-Senate conference committee has approved all but a few
details of a Pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1,
and expect to complete their work later this week, the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.
   An agreement will send the huge bill back to the Senate and
House floors for approval, and it will then go to Reagan for his
signature.
   The bill authorizes $299.5 billion in defense spending for the
upcoming fiscal year, down slightly from the $300 billion the
Pentagon is allowed to spend in the current year.
   The sources said Wednesday that the conference committee agreed
to increase spending for an anti-drug program in which Coast Guard
officers ride aboard Navy warships patrolling in offshore waters.
   The Coast Guard officers have civilian arrest powers that they
can use if the Navy vessels encounter suspected drug-trafficking
boats.
   The Coast Guard has about 300 people assigned to the program,
riding aboard Navy ships in teams of five to seven people per
vessel. Another 100 Coast Guard personnel will be added to the
program in the next three months, the sources said.
   The House had voted overwhelmingly to order Reagan to have the
Pentagon essentially seal U.S. borders against illegal drug
shipments.
   Later, the Senate easily voted to give Navy officers civilian
arrest powers if warships stopped suspected drug trafficking
vessels in international waters.
   But the Pentagon strongly opposed both those provisions. Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the military shouldn't get
involved in civilian law enforcement and warned that even if it
did, illegal drugs still would flow into the United States.
   The final compromise, while dropping the more far-reaching
anti-drug provisions passed by each chamber, requires the Pentagon
to increase the help it provides to civilian anti-drug agencies in
spotting and tracking planes and ships that might be carrying
contraband.
   The Air Force and Navy already provide intelligence help from
radar planes and ships, and Carlucci said he has no opposition to
increasing that aid.
   The conference committee, meanwhile, agreed to authorize $4.1
billion for Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the sources said. That is up from the current $3.9
billion budget, but far below the $4.8 billion Reagan had sought.
   In addition, the conferees dropped an amendment approved by the
House that would have required a halt in all but the smallest U.S.
nuclear weapons tests. The Senate had rejected the proposed ban.
   The legislators also agreed to authorize $250 million each for
the Midgetman and MX programs, a pair of controversial efforts to
develop new land-based atomic-tipped weapons. Another $250 million
was approved for spending after a new president is elected Nov. 8,
the sources said.

   The dollar closed sharply higher against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo Thursday, while prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange slid for the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 128.55 yen, up a strong 0.95 yen from
Wednesday's finish. It had opened the day more than 2 yen higher at
129.80, the day's high, and briefly touched a low of 128.25 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 64.79-point loser Wednesday, shed another 127.85
points, or 0.46 percent, to finish Thursday's session at 27,732.93.
   ``A sense of fear that the Bank of Japan would step into the
market and sell dollars to stem its rise stopped the buying
spree,'' said a foreign exchange dealer with a major commercial
bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Traders said it was not immediately known whether Japan's
central bank actually intervened to slow the dollar's rise. The
Bank of Japan does not officially comment on its market activity.
   The dealer said Japanese institutional buyers were buying
dollars during early trading following Wednesday's advance of the
U.S. currency in overseas markets.
   Traders said the stock market repeated much the same pattern as
Wednesday, when share prices climbed on the higher dollar, but then
tumbled as investors sold off on worries about higher interest
rates and inflation.

   For nearly three-quarters of a century,
Lahontan Reservoir has made an agricultural oasis of this desert
region, weathering good years and bad to irrigate 65,000 acres of
alfalfa and other crops.
   But after two consecutive winters that produced half the normal
precipitation in western Nevada, Lahontan is drying up for the
first time since its completion in 1915.
   Like many areas in the Midwest and Plains straining under one of
the worst droughts in 50 years, this fertile area will soon be out
of water. Some fields will lack irrigation in a few weeks and by
mid-September, the 600-mile network of canals will be dry,
officials said Wednesday.
   ``We've got everybody on a 70 percent allocation but it's going
to be pretty tough to meet that,'' Lyman McConnell, project manager
of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District said.
   Ted DeBraga, a Fallon farmer and president of the irrigation
district, said even the 30 percent cutback ``equates to dollars
when you start losing tonnage on the alfalfa.''
   When the flow to the alfalfa taps out, ``we'll just try to keep
it alive in hopes next year will be a better year,'' he said. ``It
isn't a rosy picture.''
   The University of Nevada-Reno has estimated the drought could
put a $14 million dent in the state's agriculture industry, the No.
3 business behind gaming and mining.
   Alfalfa, a legume with small, purplish flowers that is the
region's principal cash crop, is mainly a pasture plant used for
hay, which has fallen into short supply throughout the farm belt
because of the drought.
   McConnell said Lahontan currently holds 121,550 acre-feet of
water, barely one-third its capacity of 314,000 acre-feet. When it
reaches 10,000 acre-feet, or 32.6 million gallons of water, the
gates will be closed to maintain a small reserve for next year.
   An acre-foot is the amount of water that covers one acre to a
depth of one foot.
   The reservoir, which meanders for 20 miles along the former
Carson River bed 35 miles east of Reno, is also a popular
destination for fishing, swimming and boating.
   The project was begun shortly after the turn of the century and
within a decade had transformed the desert area into an
agricultural oasis. Despite close calls in 1924, 1929 and 1931, the
reservoir never has failed the farmers and ranchers it serves.
   Lahontan is fed by the Carson River, which is nearly exhausted,
and by water diverted from the Truckee River flowing from Lake
Tahoe and other smaller upstream reserves.
   While farmers have made their first cutting of alfalfa, most
will at best get only one more cutting rather than the typical
three, said Jeanni Conlan, of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service in Fallon.
   Those who have made four cuttings in the past aren't likely to
be that lucky this summer, she added.
   ``I'd guess there will be little water left to raise a fourth
crop of hay,'' she said. Most farmers make their third harvest
between mid-September and mid-October, about the time the water is
expected to run out, Ms. Conlan said.
   DeBraga said he had not heard of any farmers or ranchers being
in danger of foreclosure, ``but that's always a possibility, even
in a 100 percent irrigation year.''
   ``In years like this, it's that much closer,'' he said. ``Next
year's the tough one. With all the reservoirs being empty like
they're going to be this fall, it would take an excellent year to
get back even close to normal.''

<HEAD>Atlanta Mayor Says City Close To Ready For Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young says the city is
moving along with preparations for next month's Democratic National
Convention despite criticism of ``chaos and confusion'' in the
convention planning.
   ``I don't know what (they're) talking about in terms of
confusion and chaos,'' Young said on Wednesday. ``Peace and quiet
and tranquility and everybody getting along is not news, and that's
what we got.''
   Young was responding to recent news articles that reported bad
judgment calls by convention planners working on space for
convention sessions and hotel accommodations. The articles also
said some major transportation routes are still under construction
and convention planners have been fighting among themselves.
   ``I don't care what people say about Atlanta. Anybody who
doesn't like Atlanta can go somewhere else,'' Young said. ``This is
a building and growing city and it will be for some years to come,
but whatever we need for the convention is going to be ready by the
time the convention gets here.''
   Young estimated the city is about ``85 to 90 percent ready'' for
the convention, a condition with which he is ``very comfortable.''

<HEAD>Democrats Gear up to Blunt Jackson Drive Against Caucuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa Democratic leaders said ``it's not
a big surprise'' that Jesse Jackson will move to reduce the state's
role in the presidential selection process, but they are gearing up
to thwart the effort.
   The Iowans are banking on a good relationship with likely
nominee Michael Dukakis and national party leaders to carry Iowa's
early party caucuses at next month's Democratic National Convention.
   ``It shouldn't come as a big surprise,'' said Democratic
spokesman Phil Roeder. ``It seems the losing candidates in races
have a pretty good track record of challenging Iowa's place. It's
not a big surprise that one of the losers in the race is going to
bring this up.''
   Jackson started the exchange in an interview published in
Wednesday's editions of the New York Times in which he said his
forces would move at the convention to put heavily-populated states
such as California and New Jersey toward the front of the string of
primaries, rather than at the end.
   He complained that ``something is skewed'' about a process that
gives so much importance to small states such as Iowa and New
Hampshire, while bigger states play little or no role in picking
the party's nominee.
   ``I will stand for a review of the process,'' Jackson told the
newspaper. ``We're going to submit a plan dealing with ways to give
small states and big states a chance. Right now, for example, you
campaign almost a year in Iowa and 10 days in California. You do
almost no campaigning in the Northwest as a result of that
arrangement.''

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident Republicans are formally
challenging the credentials of Michigan's 77 delegates to the GOP
National Convention.
   The dissidents, who held their own alternative state
delegate-selection convention after a dispute over party rules,
sent the national party their competing list of New Orleans
conventioneers on Wednesday.
   The list is comprised mainly of the more conservative party
activists who supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacies
of Pat Robertson and New York Rep. Jack Kemp.
   They contend the convention they held was proper and followed
party rules to the letter while the one led by supporters of Vice
President George Bush violated party rules.
   The competing delegate lists now must be reviewed by the party's
``contest committee,'' which reports to the national convention's
credentials committee.
   From there, the party has a mechanism for choosing between
competing delegate slates and hearing appeals of those decisions.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis holds a
15-percentage point margin over Republican George Bush among
Maryland voters in a new poll conducted by the University of
Maryland.
   About 49 percent of the registered voters who responded favored
Dukakis, 34 percent favored Bush, 11 percent were not sure, 3
percent said they would vote for someone else, and 3 percent said
they would not vote at all.
   The poll was conducted by the university's Public Polling

   ``Of course, it's a long way to November, but the traditional
majority registration for the Democratic Party in this state may
give the Democratic candidate the edge,'' said Sue Dowden, director
of the polling project.
   President Reagan carried Maryland in his 1984 re-election
landslide, but the state went for President Carter in 1980.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hot summer weather and a widespread drought have strained the
resources of many city water systems, but the impact has been
spotty.
   Chicago draws water from Lake Michigan and has no worries about
supply, while suburban Oak Brook has shut off service to eight
customers within the past week as part of a get-tough conservation
policy.
   Farmers and ranchers around Alice, Texas, are petitioning for
federal drought relief, but in the city, ``we've got enough water
to last five years,'' said Utilities Director William H. Blythe.
   Officials in Columbus, Ohio, say water supplies are adequate,
but water use in the northwest section and some suburbs is
restricted because the distribution system can't meet summer demand.
   Los Angeles faces the second straight year of below-normal water
supplies, and the city implemented voluntary conservation measures
in April. Decorative fountains and ponds that do not use recycled
water have been turned off, water may not be used to wash sidewalks
or other paved areas, restaurants may only serve water on request
and leaks must be repaired in a timely manner.
   Last week, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a
penalty system that will sharply increase rates for households that
use more water than alloted.
   In Sparks, Nev., a homeowner was fined for $155 for wasting
water _ the first such enforcement action since a 1977 drought.
   Georgia Natural Resources Commissioner Leonard Ledbetter last
week placed water use restrictions on all surface water systems and
some ground water systems north of a line extending from Columbus
to Augusta. Several communities already have restricted water use.
   ``We told them about where we see the drought going and that we
expected July and August to get worse,'' said department spokesman
David Word.
   Last week, four Michigan communities _ Rochester, West
Bloomfield Township, Waterford Township and Orion Township _ began
alternate-day watering restrictions. Enforcement has been helped,
officials said, by hundreds of calls from neighbors.
   ``We laugh about it,'' said Al Beanblossom, assistant utility
manager in Waterford Township. ``We say, `Here comes another
squealer.'''
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich on Tuesday directed state agencies
to stop unnecessary use of water and called for voluntary,
statewide conservation.
   ``It appears that Minnesota may be in for a season-long,
statewide drought,'' Perpich said after receiving a report from a
federal-state inter-agency drought task force.
   In Philadelphia, open fire hydrants have sapped supplies, Water
Department spokesman Drew Brown said. With heat in the 90s,
hydrants are frequently opened in poorer neighborhoods to provide a
cooling splash for kids.
   Brown said more than 1,000 of the city's 26,000 hydrants had
been illegally opened Tuesday, when water usage jumped to nearly
500 million gallons _ 150 million above average. City officials
were making available cap sprinklers that can be fitted onto
hydrants, to be turned on by fire department officials.
   In nearby Quakertown, non-essential water use _ lawns,
car-washing and swimming pools _ was banned on Tuesday, Borough
Manager David Woglom announced. In Sioux Falls, S.D., the 100,000
residents are forbidden to water outdoors between noon and 7 p.m.
and may use their hoses only every other day. Still, said City
Commissioner Dick Peterson, well levels are dropping.
   ``I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see more dramatic
steps within the next couple of days. By that I mean a total ban,''
Peterson said.

   The dollar closed substantially higher today
against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, while share prices declined for
the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 128.55 yen, up a strong 0.95 yen from
Wednesday's finish. It had opened the day, however, up more than
two yen at 129.80, the currency's highest level in nearly four
months, and briefly touched a low of 128.25.
   Traders attributed the dollar's decline after an initial surge
to profit taking by institutional investors.
   ``Investors who had purchased the dollar earlier decided to
collect profits on the higher dollar,'' said a foreign exchange
dealer with a major Tokyo commercial bank, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Trading became quiet in the afternoon as dealers, concerned the
Bank of Japan would step into the market to stem the further rise
of the dollar, stepped aside, he said.
   The Japan's central bank does not officially comment on its
market activity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 64.79-point loser Wednesday, lost another 127.85
points, or 0.46 percent, to finish the day's session at 27,732.93.
   ``A wait-and-see attitude among investors coupled with
profit-taking share selling pulled the Nikkei index back,'' said a
stock analyst with a major securities house, who also demanded
anonymity.
   Encouraged by the strong dollar and overnight advance on Wall
Street, the Nikkei Index, the stock market's key barometer, rose to
a high of around 28,008 points, up about 147 points at one time
during the morning trading, dealers said.
   The brokerage official said that except for certain
large-capitals, most issues were either finished lower or remained
unchanged as investors became worried about inflation and higher
interest rates in Japan.
   The strong dollar caused Japanese government bond prices to
fall, driving up yields and concern about domestic interest rates,
traders said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares,
down from 1.2 billion shares Wednesday.
   Losers include chemicals, automobiles and financials. Some of
the large-capital steels and machineries finished higher.

   The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted
along party lines in approving a bill that arose from last year's
Iran-Contra hearings to tighten congressional control over foreign
covert intelligence action.
   The full House is expected to pass the measure, with a vote
expected sometime later this summer, but its unclear whether it can
attract enough support to override an almost certain presidential
veto.
   The 22-17 committee vote on Wednesday came after Democrats
defeated a Republican attempt to ease the proposed restrictions.
   The bill would spell out more specifically how a president must
notify the House and Senate intelligence oversight committees when
he authorizes a covert action.
   Under the proposal, a version of which already has been passed
by the Senate, the president would be required to report any covert
action to the intelligence committees within 48 hours of its
authorization.

<HEAD>South Africa Sanctions Bill To Go Ahead Despite Dim Prospects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh new
sanctions against white-dominated South Africa concede they do not
have the votes to override a threatened veto by President Reagan.
   But they said they would battle for Senate passage of the bill
to highlight congressional opposition to South Africa's racial
policies.
   The bill would end most trade with South Africa and call for
withdrawal of U.S. corporate investment.
   Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead strongly
opposed the harsh sanctions measure as counterproductive.
   And Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the leading opponent of using
sanctions to increase pressures on South Africa to adopt majority
rule reforms, said he will introduce legislation repealing the less
severe sanctions bill passed over President Reagan's veto two years
ago.
   Whitehead said that while the Reagan administration believes
apartheid is repugnant, ``Resorting to drastic remedies, such as
the misuse of American power to destabilize the South African
economy, only increases the chances of a catastrophic outcome for
all South Africans.'

<HEAD>House Keeps Space Station Funds in $10.7 Billion NASA Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved $10.7 billion to run the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration after defeating a
move to divert $400 million from space station funds into social
programs.
   The measure still must pass the Senate, whose appropriations
committee on Wednesday also voted $10.7 billion for NASA. The
Senate bill, however, assumes that $600 million will be transferred
to the space station from unspent defense funds.
   That proposed fund transfer was called unacceptable in a letter
that President Reagan sent to Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., and
Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the chairman and ranking minority member of
the appropriations committee.
   At the same time, however, the president said that letting the
space station wither for lack of funds would be ``totally
unacceptable.''
   NASA had asked for $967 million in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1 to start the design phase of the $16 billion space station.
Under the bill passed by the House, the agency would get $902
million.
   The NASA funds are part of a $59.7 billion appropriation bill
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 15
independent agencies that passed the House 377-40.

<TEXT>
   Defense consultant Melvyn R. Paisley
allegedly arranged for high-level Defense Department officials to
smuggle classified documents out of the Pentagon and allow him to
copy the papers with the help of his wife, according to a published
report today.
   Citing unnamed government sources, the Los Angeles Times
reported today that Paisley allegedly passed sensitive information
to his major client, McDonnell Douglas Corp., which paid him what
one source described as ``staggering fees'' as a consultant.
   Paisley was retained by the defense contracting firm the day he
left his post as assistant secretary of the Navy on March 31, 1987,
according to the Times.
   James E. Gaines, Paisley's close deputy in the Navy Department
and one of six Pentagon officials stripped of access to secret
documents Tuesday, is suspected of being a major supplier of the
classified materials, according to a document in the investigation,
the Times reported.
   Sources familiar with the investigation told The Associated
Press Wednesday that Gaines is cooperating with government
investigators.
   The investigation that surfaced last week involves allegations
that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former
military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   The details on Paisley and Gaines cited by the Times are the
most detailed yet on how investigators believe the alleged scheme
worked.
   The Times quoted sources who said Paisley recommended McDonnell
Douglas hire Adm. James A. Lyons, retired commander of the U.S.
Pacific Command, whose offices were the target of a search warrant
last week, to assist in the effort to sell the company's F-18
fighter-bomber to South Korea.
   Lyons went to work last December to with Paisley on the effort.
   The warrant served in St. Louis seeks a wide range of documents
``relating to the work of Ace Lyons for McDonnell Douglas from
December, 1987, through 1988.''
   E. Lawrence Barcella, attorney for Paisley and his wife, Vicki,
said Wednesday it would be ``premature to make any comment. There
is nothing specific from the prosecutors to comment on.''
   ``This case is still in the evidence-gathering stage,'' Barcella
said.
   Paisley and Lyons could not be reached for comment.
   Paisley's involvement in the sale of F-18s to U.S. allies,
including South Korea, was a major focus of a warrant the FBI
obtained last week to search the office of Thomas Gunn, the firm's
marketing vice president, at the company's St. Louis headquarters.
   The search warrant said Paisley ``has provided McDonnell Douglas
and Thomas Gunn substantial information obtained from government
officials which has been classified and@or confidential or not
available to the contracting public.''
   Bob O'Brien, a spokesman in McDonnell Douglas' Washington
office, repeated a statement the company issued last week when
Gunn's office was searched.
   ``We are not aware of any improper requests by the company to
Mr. Paisley or any improper activities by Mr. Paisley on behalf of
the company,'' the statement said.
   Gaines, who was deputy assistant secretary for acquisition until
he was reassigned Tuesday by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,
was regarded as a key aide to Paisley when both were at the
Pentagon.
   Both men worked for the Boeing Co.'s aerospace unit in Seattle
in the 1970s.
   The Koreans, who have indicated they were interested in buying
as many as 120 new warplanes, have not yet chosen between the
General Dynamics F-16 and the F-18.

   A political consultant faces a possible
38-year prison term after being convicted of gathering forged
signatures on petitions that put Pete du Pont on the state's
Republican presidential primary ballot.
   Rocky Mountain and his Southern Political Consulting Inc. each
were convicted Wednesday on 38 counts of misdemeanor forgery for
directing workers to put phony signatures, including those of two
dead people, on the petitions that qualified the former Delaware
governor for the March primary.
   For each count, the 27-year-old Mountain faces fines of up to
$2,000 and one year in prison. Southern Political Consulting faces
fines of up to $10,000 per count for a potential total of $380,000.
   The punishment phase was set for today.
   Prosecutors said Mountain staged a Dec. 19 ``forgery party'' at
his Houston office, complete with beer for underage drinkers, to
get the signatures needed for du Pont.
   Jurors deliberated almost four hours before reaching the
verdict. Mountain said he was disappointed, but reserved further
comment until after sentencing.
   He stood motionless as Harris County Court-at-Law Judge Sherman
Ross read the long series of guilty verdicts. Kevin Burnette,
president of Southern Political, stood with his arms folded and
eyes looking down as Ross read the verdicts against the firm.
   Mountain, a vice president of the Houston-based firm, was hired
by the du Pont campaign to gather the 5,000 signatures needed to
get on the ballot.
   In convicting Mountain, jurors rejected the defense argument
that he ordered temporary workers to sign phony signatures only
because he had been goaded by a du Pont official for being unable
to collect legitimate ones.
   Mountain testified he never intended for the du Pont campaign to
submit the phony petitions.
   The six-member jury also rejected the argument that Mountain was
working as a du Pont volunteer, not a company employee, when he
ordered the forgeries. Du Pont and his campaign officials have
denied knowledge of the forgeries. No one from the du Pont campaign
testified here.
   ``Was there an intent to defraud or harm? I don't think so,''
Joe Bailey, Mountain's lawyer, said in Wednesday's closing
argument. ``Rocky Mountain (was) hacked off and he (did) something
stupid.''
   Prosecutor Casey O'Brien told jurors, ``There was harm, folks.
   ``He lied to you. He lied,'' O'Brien said of Mountain's claim
that he did not intend to deceive anyone.
   Seven people testified Mountain bought them beer and showed them
how to forge signatures on the petitions.
   Thirty-five witnesses, whose names appeared on the petitions,
testified they had not signed the petitions. Another witness said
the signature of his mother, a nursing home resident, looked phony.
   Testimony also showed that the signatures of two dead people
were on the du Pont petitions.

   Kathleen Hastings, 31, was a basketball star and cheerleader
when she graduated from Iola High School in 1975. Her sister, Lisa
Maxwell, 26, was a homecoming queen and graduated in 1980. Both
were honor students.
   The collision occurred Tuesday near Cherokee, about 100 miles
southeast of Iola. A paramedic collapsed and died trying to save
one of the children.
   ``It just stunned us,'' Pat Friskel, the mother and grandmother
of the victims, said Wednesday. ``You just can't expect it. To have
it happen to so many of our children and their children. And all at
once. You never think it's going to happen.''
   Mrs. Friskel and her husband, Paul, are co-owners of Iola's
funeral home and will handle the services.
   All seven people in the station wagon were killed, including
Mrs. Hastings' children, Cara, 8, Eric, 5, and Reuben, 3, and Mrs.
Maxwell's children, Joel, 5, and Avery, 2.
   In addition, Joseph R. Cobb, 48, director of the Crawford County
ambulance service, died of a heart attack while trying to
resuscitate one of the victims at a Pittsburg hospital.
   ``I'm sure there have been a lot of tears shed in this
community, even by people who may not have known them all that
well, because this strikes real close to home,'' said Iola Mayor
John Carder.
   Officials investigating the accident said Mrs. Hastings, who was
driving, either did not see the Burlington Northern freight train
or tried to race it to the crossing.
   ``As far as we can determine ... there was no attempt (by the
driver) to avoid the accident,'' said Trooper Dan Smith of the
Kansas Highway Patrol, who spent Wednesday reconstructing the
accident.
   The car left no skid marks and did not veer as it approached the
crossing, which had no signals, lights or arms, but was in a clear
intersection. Two double-fatality accidents have occurred there
since 1978.
   The engineer was cleared of any responsibility in the accident,
Smith said. He was driving the southbound train 10 miles below the
55 mph speed limit.
   The engineer sounded his whistle before reaching the crossing,
Smith said. He put on the emergency brakes when he saw the station
wagon, but the switching engine and seven freight cars required at
least a quarter-mile to stop.
   ``There's probably nothing more of a nightmare than (an
engineer) seeing a loaded car on a railroad crossing,'' said Robin
Hughes, a Burlington Northern spokeswoman. ``It's always
emotionally difficult. This one was catastrophic.''

<HEAD>Ailing Mathematician Receives Unofficial Word He Can Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ailing Jewish mathematician who has tried in
vain to leave the Soviet Union for more than nine years said today
that officials had told him they no longer object to his emigration.
   But refusenik Benjamin Charny, 50, said he still had not
received official permission to join relatives in the United States.
   Charny said he received a telephone call Wednesday from his
former workplace telling him that the Ministry of General Machine
Building that oversees it no longer objects to his emigrating.
   Charny's younger brother, Leon, told The Associated Press in an
interview from his Needham, Mass., home Wednesday that U.S.
officials called to say they had been informed Charny would be
allowed to leave.
   Asked about the reports in the United States, Charny said that
because of the high official sources, ``I think it is so.''
   However, he said in a telephone interview that he had no
official confirmation from the Soviet visa office.
   If they are given permission to leave, Charny said he and his
wife Yadviga would join relatives near Boston.
   In another long-time refusenik case, U.S. officials also said
that Yuri and Tanya Zieman and their 11-year-old daughter Vera
would be allowed to emigrate. President Reagan considered visiting
the Zieman family during his trip to Moscow but U.S. officials have
said he did not because high-ranking Soviet officials told them the
Zieman family never would be allowed to emigrate if Reagan visited
them.
   If the Charny and Zieman families are allowed to leave, it would
resolve two of best-known refusenik cases. Beginning last year,
Soviet officials increased Jewish emigration and have allowed most
of the best-known refuseniks to leave.
   But Jewish activists claim thousands of those who have not
attracted media attention remain behind and the Soviet system still
violates their rights to emigration by applying unreasonable state
secrecy criteria and demanding waivers of financial responsibilty
from relatives who stay behind.
   Charny was refused permission to leave because of calculations
on trajectories of space flight he did between 1966 and 1971.
   He had surgery eight years ago to remove a cancerous tumor, and
said he needs surgery for another tumor on his neck. He also
suffered a heart attack recently and said he needs medical
treatment in the United States.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts In Arms Export Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three arms dealers were convicted of plotting to
illegally ship military equipment to Argentina, Iraq, Poland and
the Soviet Union in what authorities said was the first
racketeering prosecution of an arms export case.
   The U.S. District Court jury returned the verdict Wednesday and
was to meet today to decide on forfeiture of the $1 million in
illegal profits from the deals, which included the shipment of
1,300 night-vision goggles to Argentina during the Falkland Islands
war with Great Britain.
   The three main defendants _ Solomon Schwartz, 54, of Monsey,
owner of Texas Armament Advisors Inc.; Leonard Berg, 52, of New
York, owner of HLB Security Electronics Ltd.; and Leon Lisbona, 63,
of New York, an HLB employee _ were found guilty of all charges.
   They were convicted of 13 counts, including racketeering, wire
fraud, violations of federal export law, conspiracy and making
false statements to a governmental agency. Schwartz and Berg also
were convicted of obstruction of justice.
   The most serious charge, racketeering, carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison.
   A fourth defendant, Grim DePancicis, 44, of Mount Dora, Fla., an
associate of HLB, was convicted of aiding an illegal export and
conspiracy in connection with the Soviet deal but was acquitted of
a charge alleging his involvement in the Argentine shipment.
   In that deal, the military equipment was smuggled out of the
country without a required export license by couriers who hid the
goggles in luggage, prosecutors said.
   Another deal involved a shipment of 110 boxes of handguns,
shotguns and ammunition that the government contends was destined
for Iraq but was seized by authorities in Belgium.
   A third illegal export was a ``sting'' by the U.S. Customs
Service to ship 400 night-vision devices to the Soviet Union. One
sample was smuggled out of the United States without an export
license to a post office box in West Germany.
   The last deal involved a shipment of 500 automatic rifles,
ammunition and other weapons that had an export license for Mexico
but was to go to Poland, the indictment said. The arms were seized
at Kennedy International Airport in February 1984 and the
defendants were charged soon after.
   The defendants used two means to arrange the deals, which took
place between 1982 and 1984, prosecutors said during the
three-month trial: They either did not obtain export licenses as
required for arms shipments or used licenses for a shipment to a
legal destination but had the arms sent elsewhere.
   Defense attorneys denied their clients had committed any illegal
actions and said that all the transactions were carried out openly
because the defendants had nothing to hide.
   Schwartz testified that the Polish shipment was arranged to
establish routine business dealings in Poland to facilitate the
possible purchase of two Soviet tanks wanted by U.S. intelligence
officials.
   He said he was sought out by the CIA in 1982 and later had
contact with the Defense Intelligence Agency concerning the
purchase of two Soviet T-72 tanks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Krantz said the prosecution was
the first time the federal racketeering statute was used in an
illegal arms export case.
   He said it was alleged the defendants made about $1 million from
the four deals.

<HEAD>More Beer Bars to Open As Anti-Booze Campaign Finds Moderation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials have approved plans to open 133 new
bars, automatic dispensers and restaurants to sell beer as part of
a more balanced approach to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-alcohol
campaign, a newspaper reported.
   But Moscow News said in an article in its Wednesday editions
that Muscovites still have to be lucky to find a bottle of beer
anywhere.
   The newspaper said the city government's decision to allow beer
sales in more places is a ``step toward a more considered approach
to the struggle with drunkenness and alcoholism.''
   ``Life showed that this problem cannot be solved only with
prohibitive measures,'' it said.
   Moscow city officials also ordered a 19 percent increase in beer
production this year, but Moscow News said breweries cannot meet
their deliveries because of a shortage of bottles.
   And more than a month after city officials ordered the
establishment of bars, restaurants and dispensers to sell beer,
there is no sign of them. Moscow News said officials set no time
limit to fulfill the order.
   In one of his first major acts after becoming Communist Party
general secretary in 1985, Gorbachev cracked down on drinking. The
drinking age was raised, prices of alcoholic beverages went up and
the hours of liquor stores were restricted.
   Soviet officials credit the campaign with improving worker
discipline and improving public health, but there also has been
increasing criticism.
   Consumers often have to stand in long lines to buy a bottle of
vodka or wine, and moonshining has contributed to a sugar shortage.

<HEAD>Irish Eyes Are Cryin' For Tenor Dennis Day, Who Died at Age 71</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Day, a golden-voiced Irish balladeer
whose career as a foil for comedian Jack Benny spanned decades of
radio, television and film, has died after a long battle with Lou
Gehrig's disease. He was 71.
   Day died at his Bel Air home late Wednesday, surrounded by his
10 children and 13 grandchildren, said his publicist, Kitty Davis.
   ``Everyone is taking it very hard,'' she said.
   His wife, Peggy Margaret McNulty was admitted to St. John's
Hospital and Health Center earlier in the day for cardiac tests and
was in stable condition, said nursing supervisor Nancy Gauthier.
Doctors have not confirmed whether she suffered a heart attack, Ms.
Gauthier said.
   The cause of death was not determined, but Day was diagnosed
last year as suffering from amyotropic lateral sclerosis, a
progressive muscular ailment that killed Lou Gehrig.
   He had undergone brain surgery in March after suffering a fall,
and was readmitted to St. John's on June 5, the hospital said. He
was released from the hospital Monday.
   ``I'm very, very saddened by Dennis' death,'' said comedian
Jerry Lewis, national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, which Day supported.
   ``Dennis Day was a brave, kind, talented man who showed his love
by giving. All you had to do was ask.''
   Day's career spanned decades in radio, television and movies,
and he was rated as one of the shrewdest talents in the business.
   Born Eugene Denis McNulty to Irish parents in New York City on
May 21, 1917, he was graduated from St. Patrick's Cathedral High
School and attended Manhattan College with plans to enter Fordham's
law school.
   His plans changed when Jack Benny was hunting for a singer to
replace Kenny Baker. A recording Day had made earned him an
audition, and an off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job,
according to a studio biography.
   With all the applicants gathered in an audition room, Benny
called out, ``Oh Dennis!'' Young McNulty replied, ``Yes, please.''
   ``That's it!'' Benny whooped.
   He assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio show
as a singer in 1939, and quickly matured into a comic target for
the host. One of Day's trademark lines was a sprightly, ``Gee, Mr.
Benny!''
   With a nationwide audience on radio, Day gained popularity with
his renditions of ``Danny Boy,'' ``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and
other ballads. Another Day favorite, ``Peg of my Heart'' was a
ballad he sang for his wife, said Ms. Davis.
   In 1952, Day disclosed that Irish authorities had banned his RCA
recording of ``The St. Patrick's Day Parade.''
   ``The Irish didn't object to the song or to my singing,'' Day
said, but to shouted exlamations such as ``How are ye, Paddy, me
boy!'' as if he were marching in a parade.
   ``They said (it) sounded like stage Irish,'' Day said at the
time, with some bemusement.
   Day moved to television with Benny's show in 1950, making
irregular appearances.
   In 1951, Day demonstrated his business acumen by landing a movie
contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was the only Fox
contract player with television rights. He also signed a contract
with NBC, after allowing weeks of bidding between the network and
competitor CBS.
   Day became a regular on such TV variety shows as ``All Star
Revue,'' ``Hour Glass,'' ``The RCA Victor Show,'' ``Max Liebman
Presents'' and his own ``Dennis Day Show.''
   He also appeared in several films, including ``Buck Benny Rides
Again,'' ``Music in Manhattan,'' ``One Sunday Afternoon'' and ``The
Girl Next Door.''
   In their later years, the Days divided their time between their
Bel Air home and a second home in Hawaii. He enjoyed horseback
riding and sailing.
   During a vacation in Hawaii last year, Day became aware of a
muscle-control problem and returned to the Scripps Clinic in La
Jolla, where doctors diagnosed ALS.
   Day's publicist said that though he was confined to a
wheelchair, he continued to make appearances at Irish fairs and
medical benefits.
   ``Up to the end there, he was still doing benefits. After he
found out that he had ALS he said that he wanted to do as much for
this research group as possible,'' Ms. Davis said.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEAD>Striking Scriptwriters Vote On Contract In Heated Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking scriptwriters packed meeting halls
on both coasts to vote on the latest contract offer in heated
meetings that could decide the outcome to the 16-week-old walkout
tonight.
   Writers Guild of America leaders in Los Angeles urged their
membership Wednesday night to reject the $71 million contract
offered last week by producers. Dissident writers, eager for a
settlement, called for its approval.
   A similar meeting took place in New York. Results of the vote
were to be announced late today.
   Union President George Kirgo called the balloting critical,
saying it would determine ``how we're going to deal with the whole
industry in the future.''
   The guild struck March 7 over the issue of payments for reruns
of one-hour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the
increased foreign market. The union also sought better guidelines
to protect a writer's work and allow writers to re-acquire
unproduced scripts.
   Agreement was reached on matters of creative control, but both
sides remain divided on the rerun economic package.
   Originally, officials had hoped to announce results after the
vote Wednesday night, but the overwhelming response slowed the
tabulation, an official said.
   Guild Executive Director Brian Walton refused to speculate on
how the vote would go.
   ``I don't know how big the vote will be to accept or reject. ...
I don't know how big the divisions really are,'' said Walton, who
received a standing ovation during a nearly hour-long presentation
advocating rejection of the contract.
   Bill Blinn, a member of the pro-settlement Writers Coalition,
told the audience, ``This industry feeds on us, and we feed on it.''
   He challenged the strategy suppositions made by Walton and the
union leadership, telling union members, ``There is one thing that
is absolutely definite ... there is a contract here that can get us
back to work in two days. That is a fact, that's not anyone's
supposition.''
   The union has about 9,500 members nationwide, about 6,000 on the
West Coast.
   Members of the dissident Writers Coalition suggested that if
they could get 30 percent of the vote they would have shown enough
strength to change conditions and force a quick settlement.
   But Kirgo disputed that claim, saying a 70 percent showing for
support after four months of striking would be a strong statement
for the union stance.

<HEAD>Governing Party's Split Widens With Choice Of Second Presidential
Candidate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faction of the governing
Christian Democratic Party has nominated a second presidential
candidate for next year's elections, further widening the split in
El Salvador's top political party.
   Fidel Chavez Mena was chosen unanimously Wednesday by 180
national delegates who gathered at Christian Democratic
headquarters in San Salvador.
   Chavez Mena, 48, is the former minister of the presidency and
communications under President Jose Napoleon Duarte's U.S.-backed
government.
   Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes, a businessman and former foreign
minister under Duarte, was nominated by the party's other faction
on April 29.
   Rey Prendes, 55, has said he will take the matter to the Supreme
Court. In comments to journalists Tuesday, he called Chavez Mena
``a thief.''
   Each faction considers the other's convention illegal.
   Duarte, honorary party president, called last month for both
hopefuls to step aside to make way for a unity candidate in the
March 1989 election.
   By law, Duarte cannot run for reelection. The president is being
treated in Washington for terminal cancer, though his son has said
Duarte will resume his duties in July.
   The bitter infighting has further hurt the Christian Democrats,
soundly defeated as they were by the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym as Arena, in
municipal and legislative elections in March.
   El Salvador has had an elected civilian government since 1982,
but leftist rebels contend it is only a facade for dictatorial
military rule. They accuse rightist death squads and paramilitary
forces of killing civilians.
   The civil war that has claimed 65,000 lives since October 1979
is generally considered to be stalemated, but guerrilla leaders
recently pledged to step up their military campaign.

   A woman wanted for investigation in a fatal
1980 letter-bombing was arrested as she entered the United States
and was jailed pending a bail hearing, officials said.
   Rochelle Ida Manning, 48, was arrested Wednesday as she stepped
off a jetliner following a flight from Israel, where she had been
living as a fugitive, authorities said.
   She appeared before U.S. Magistrate George King, who ordered her
held.
   Ms. Manning, who holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, was
charged with conpiracy to mail an explosive device and with aiding
in the mailing of the device on July 17, 1980, said U.S. Attorney
Nancy Stock.
   Ms. Manning's attorney, Lee Smith, said she also was questioned
by the FBI and postal inspectors about the Oct. 11, 1985, letter
bombing of Arab rights leader Alex Odeh in his Santa Ana office. No
one has been charged in that killing.
   Ms. Manning was charged along with her husband, Robert Steven
Manning, 36, in the fatal bombing of Patricia Wilkerson, a Prowest
Computer Corp. secretary who opened the package addressed to her
boss, Brenda Crouthamel.
   According to an affidavit by Postal Inspector Glenn Porter, the
fingerprints of Ms. Manning and her husband appeared on the letter
bomb sent to the Manhattan Beach-based company.
   Her husband remains a fugitive.
   Ms. Manning, who left her home in Kiryat Arba, on the Israeli
occupied West Bank, was aware of the investigation before she
returned to the United States, Smith said.
   A motive for the bombing has not been determined, said Postal
Inspector Michael Ahern. But, he added, the sending of the
explosive device did not appear to be politically motivated.

   A federal appeals court has reinstated a
lawsuit filed by entertainer Bette Midler after an advertising
agency allegedly tried to duplicate her voice and singing style in
one of its ad campaigns.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled
Wednesday that Midler could pursue her suit against the Ford Motor
Co. and the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. The court said
certain personal attributes _ such as a voice _ can be considered
property rights, protected by state law.
   The television ad campaign featured one of Midler's former
backup signers performing ``Do You Want To Dance'' in an ad for the
Mercury Sable car.
   The agency's ads included nine original singers and 10
``sound-alikes'' for its series, the court said.
   After being turned down by Midler's manager, the agency
contacted Uta Hedwig, who once sang backup for Midler, and asked
her to imitate Midler's voice, the court said.
   U.S. District Judge Ferdinand Fernandez said Young & Rubicam
acted like ``the average thief'' but dismissed Midler's suit,
saying no law prohibits imitation of a singer's voice.
   But the appeals court disagreed.
   ``A voice is as distinctive and personal as a face,'' the
appeals court said. ``When a distinctive voice of a professional
singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to
sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs.''
   A lawyer for Ford and the ad agency did not return telephone
calls Wednesday.

   Iraqi warplanes today bombed 10 oil
production installations and pumping stations in Iran in the
heaviest air raids on Iranian economic targets in weeks, the
official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said six targets in the Ahwaz
oilfields in southwestern Khuzestan province were hit and caught
fire.
   Soon after, two installations at the Bibi Hakimah oilfield, 120
miles to the southeast were bombed and set ablaze, INA reported.
   Another formation of jets hit the Kagsaran terminal on the
northern coast of the Persian Gulf at about the same time, leaving
the targets shrouded in flames and smoke, the agency said.
   All the planes returned safely to their bases, INA added.
   There was no immediate comment from Tehran and the Iraqi claims
could not be independently confirmed.
   INA quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a
message to Tehran that ``it has lost the war in all fields and that
there is no alternative to save Iran from total deterioration but
to accept peace.''
   Today's air raids were the first significant strikes against
Iranian oil installations on land since early May, when
fighter-bombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical
plants.
   The air force has also attacked several Iranian oil tankers in
the gulf a bit to choke off the vital oil exports Tehran needs to
finance its war effort.
   French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s carried out a long-range
1,500-mile raid on Iran's Larak Island oil terminal in the southern
gulf on May 14, setting five tankers on fire.
   The targets included the world's largest vessel, the 564,739-ton
Seawise Giant.
   Iraqi air strikes inflicted considerable damage on Iran's oil
infrastructure in March and April, oil industry and diplomatic
sources reported. Refineries were repeatedly hit.
   Oil industry sources say Iran has been forced to import
unprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation fuel
and kerosene, because refinery production has been badly reduced.
   Iraq's air force has been concentrating on attacking Iranian
troop concentrations in the last few weeks as the land war heated
up.
   Both sides have claimed to have killed or wounded thousands of
each other's troops in various sectors of the 730-mile front.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.

<HEAD>Ex-Ticket Manager For Calgary Olympics Sentenced For Fraud, Theft</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former ticket manager for the 1988
Winter Olympics in Calgary has been convicted and sentenced to five
years in jail on charges involving early ticket sales in the United
States.
   A jury of eight men and four women returned the guilty verdict
Wednesday against Jim McGregor, 39. He was sentenced later in the
day.
   McGregor was charged after he sold about 1,200 tickets in the
United States through his company, World Tickets Inc.
   The charges included two of fraud, two of theft, one count of
forgery, one of dealing with a forged document and one of mischief.
   During the 11-day trial, the Alberta Queen's Bench court heard
evidence that McGregor altered 10,000 Olympic ticket forms so that
payment in U.S. dollars went to his company, instead of Olympic
organizers.
   The prosecution said McGregor stood to make more than $1.6
million by the time he was charged, Americans had sent almost $1
million with 1,200 Olympic order forms to World Tickets Inc.
   Organizers said they caught the irregularities in time to make
sure all legitimate ticket orders were filled.
   On Wednesday, McGregor's members wept and embraced him after
hearing Justice John Dea's sentence. Outside the court, Mal
McGregor said his brother acted in the interests of the Olympic
organizing committee and the public.
   ``We know there was no intent on Jim's part to do anything but
protect the interests of everyone who was applying to take part in
the initial ticket allocation,'' he told reporters.

<HEAD>Study: Human Ancestors Ate Softer Foods Than Evolutionary Cousins
Did</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of ancient teeth suggests ancestors of
humans ate soft fruits and leaves but their evolutionary cousins
ate nuts and bark, scientists reported today.
   The study compared microscopic wear patterns of teeth from human
ancestors called Australopithecus and their ``cousins,'' called
Paranthropus, with those of modern animals with known diets.
   The work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Frederick Grine, associate professor of anthropology at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Richard Kay,
professor of anatomy at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   They studied detailed replicas of molars that Australopithecus
left some 2.5 million to 2.8 million years ago in South Africa, and
that Paranthropus left there some 1.5 million to 1.8 million years
ago.
   The two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust
australopithecines, respectively.
   Both walked upright, but after their lineages split some 2.5
million years ago, the Australopithecus group evolved toward modern
humans while the Paranthropus branch eventually died out.
   In the study, Paranthropus teeth showed more pits, and wider
pits and scratches, suggesting a diet of tougher foods than
Australopithecus ate, researchers said. The difference probably led
to the bigger teeth and larger jaws of Paranthropus, they said.

<HEAD>Continent's Oldest Well-Preserved Fossils of Land Vertebrates
Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported finding North
America's oldest well-preserved fossils of land-dwelling
vertebrates, and said the find should yield important information
about early species of such animals.
   Several hundred fossils have been collected in southeast Iowa
from what was apparently a pond when the animals lived 335 million
years ago, scientists said in today's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   News of the fossils had been publicized in 1986.
   The Nature report was written by John Bolt of the Field Museum
of Natural History in Chicago, Robert McKay and Brian Witzke of the
Iowa Department of Natural Resouces, and M.P. McAdams of William
Penn College in Oskaloosa, Iowa.
   The ancient animals lived 15 million years after amphibians
appeared on the scene. The fossils include nearly complete
skeletons of at least two apparently new species of amphibians,
including one related to ancient animals called anthracosaurs,
researchers said.
   At least eight fish species are also represented, they said.
   The find is important, partly because it is the first such site
of the Mississippian age reported from the middle of the continent,
Alec Panchen of the University of Newcastle in England wrote in an
editorial accompanying the report.
   Earlier, similar animals of the Mississippian age had been known
mainly from Scotland, Nova Scotia and an area including northwern
West Virginia, he said.

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS Infections Among Emergency Room Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emergency room workers should handle all blood as
though it's tainted with the AIDS virus because of the risk of
patients having unrecognized AIDS infections, a report today
concludes.
   The researchers found that at one inner city emergency room, 4
percent of the patients were infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, but
did not know it.
   Their report concludes that ``infection-control precautions
should be consistently applied, particularly in emergency settings,
by all health care workers coming in contact with blood or other
body fluids, whether HIV infection is known or suspected, and
regardless of patients' condition at presentation or knowledge of
their risk-factor status.''
   The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is
based on a survey of 2,302 emergency room patients who were treated
over a six-week period last year at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore.
   HIV infection was most common among black men between ages 30
and 34. The survey found that 11 percent of them carried the virus.
   Three-quarters of the emergency room patients were black. The
doctors wrote that the high infection rate ``may reflect the rapid
spread of HIV into the local inner city, predominantly black
population.''
   The risk of hospital workers catching AIDS from the patients is
considered to be very low. Nevertheless, experts recommend that
doctors, nurses and technicians take special precautions when
handling the blood of AIDS-infected patients to eliminate even this
low risk.
   The researchers said that during the period studied, only 27
patients who were already known to be infected were treated with
special precautions. Their blood was labeled infectious, and health
care workers wore gloves when performing procedures or handling
blood. After medical evaluations, the examining rooms were cleaned
with disinfectant.

<TEXT>
   Sen. John McCain is challenging actress
Jane Fonda to take her apology to Vietnam War veterans for her
wartime trip to Hanoi a step further by helping to resolve
lingering problems the war created.
   Fonda apologized last week on national television to Americans
who served in Vietnam for her actions during the trip, which she
said she made in an attempt to help end the killing.
   McCain, R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said he
accepts the apology ``if she is sincere.''
   In a Senate speech Wednesday in Washington, he said Fonda can
demonstrate her sincerity by working to help resolve the continuing
MIA issue in Vietnam.
   He said she also could appeal to the Vietnamese to end the
so-called re-education camps in which members of the South
Vietnamese army or administration are held.
   In addition, McCain said Fonda could help in the repatriation of
the 20,000 Amerasian children who remain in Vietnam.
   ``These issues we know will only be resolved when we can close
this chapter of American history which has caused so much pain,
suffering and division within our society,'' McCain said in his
speech's text, which also was released in Phoenix.

<HEAD>Strike Ends At Hyundai Motor Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hyundai Motor Co. workers accepted
company-proposed wage increases today and formally ended a 26-day
strike.
   Both company and labor union officials said the company's plant
in the southeastern city of Ulsan would resume production later
today after preparation and cleaning.
   ``The settlement is not 100 percent satisfactory, but I am sure
most members would understand what we have achieved,'' said union
leader Lee Yung-bok.
   Company president Lee Yang-sup welcomed the settlement and said,
``All Hyundai officials and workers would do our best to make up
for lost production.''
   Hyundai said the strike cost $490 million in lost sales.
   The settlement will give workers an immediate pay increase of
$106 a month. Hyundai workers earn an average of $800 a month after
five years, including allowances.
   Union leaders called off the strike Monday, indicating the
company had assured them considerable pay hikes if their boycott
ended voluntarily.
   The union's decision prompted Hyundai to announce the reopening
of its plant on Tuesday. But the plant failed to reopen Tuesday as
union leaders changed their mind and made a new demand for payment
of lost wages during the strike.
   The company rejected the union demand but offered a one-shot
payment of $206 to ``encourage workers to work harder to increase
production.'' The union accepted the offer.
   Hyundai planned to produce 720,000 vehicles this year and export
two-thirds of them to the United States and other countries.

<HEAD>Scores Injured As Rival Bands Of Monks Battle In Seoul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 63 people were injured today
when hundreds of rival Buddhist monks and followers clashed with
clubs and rocks over the leadership of a temple.
   Witnesses said fierce fighting broke out shortly after midnight,
when about 150 monks, helped by followers armed with clubs, iron
bars and rocks, stormed the Bongun Temple in southern Seoul to
drive out rival monks.
   Local news reports said clashes contined for three hours before
dawn as about 100 monks barricaded the temple and resisted with
rocks and clubs, injuring 13 people on both sides. In the end, the
attacking faction took over the temple.
   Early today, monks driven out in the initial clashes returned to
the scene with about 100 followers and tried to recapture the
shrine, triggering another free-for-all, the Korean news agency
Yonhap said.
   Some followers used tear gas guns and knives, and clashes
involving fists and clubs went on for four more hours, injuring 50
more people, Yonhap said.
   About 300 riot police deployed around the temple stayed away
during the free-for-all.
   The Bongun dispute dates back to April 13, when South Korea's
main Buddhist sect, Chokye, tried to replace the head priest of the
temple. His followers disobeyed the reshuffle order.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Sweep Away Some of The Heat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Violent thunderstorms helped ease a searing heat wave in parts
of the Midwest and Northeast today but the storms brought hail and
wind up to 80 mph to New York and Massachusetts and a tornado to
Florida.
   Thunderstorms developing along a cold front Wednesday night in
the northeastern United States created severe weather in Vermont,
Massachusetts and New York.
   A tornado early Wednesday struck near Lakeland, Fla., injuring
two people slightly as it flipped one mobile home and damaged eight
others, a Polk County spokeswoman said.
   Winds blew to 80 mph at the Schenectady Airport in Albany, N.Y.,
and at Gardner, Mass., and to 74 mph at the Blue Hill Observatory
near Boston.
   In New York, hail as big as golf balls pelted Johnstown, Fonda,
northwest of Albany, and Troy. In Massachusetts, large hail also
hit Middlefield, Chester and Middlesex.
   Meanwhile, 64 cities in 24 states sweltered through another day
of record-breaking, blistering heat Wednesday. Temperatures climbed
into the 90s or above 100 degrees across much of the nation east of
the Rockies and soared well above 100 degrees in the Southwest.
   Afternoon highs of 98 degrees at Pittsburgh and 100 degrees at
Baltimore tied records for the month of June. The all-time record
of 112 degrees for Tucson, Ariz., established on Tuesday, lasted
only a day when the mercury soared to 114 degrees on Wednesday.
   But showers and thunderstorms ushered cooler weather into the
upper Midwest and the northeastern United States early today with
temperatures in the 60s, with 50s and upper 40s in northern Great
Lakes region.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
central Gulf Coast to Florida; widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the mid- Atlantic states and the Carolinas
across Tennessee, the Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi Valley
to southern and eastern Texas; widely scattered afternoon and
evening thunderstorms through the northern and central rockies and
the inter-mountain West.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 90s to near 100 degrees
across much of the nation; between 100 and 105 degrees over the
Great Plains, the Great Basin and central valleys of California;
near 110 degrees over eastern Montana and to 115 degrees in the
desert Southwest; in the 70s and 80s from New England, across New
York, Pennsylania, the upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region to
the upper Mississippi Valley, as well as the Pacific Northwest and
along the California coast; a few locations across upper Michigan
will remain in the 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 100 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Active Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in active European trading this
morning, supported by widespread bullish sentiment. Gold prices
were lower, depressed by the dollar's strength.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was buoyed by the
recent improvement in the U.S. trade deficit, higher U.S. interest
rates and indications that world monetary authorities aren't overly
concerned about a stronger dollar.
   The dollar started the European day on a very bullish note in
hectic trading dominated by buyers. The market then calmed down a
bit, with more regular two-way trading.
   One Italian trader said central bank intervention against the
dollar's rise had been minimal, effectively giving the market a
green light to take the dollar higher.
   ``The dollar is on a forward march,'' a trader at a West German
bank in Dusseldorf said. ``The mood is confident.''
   But another dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said the dollar's
near-term direction isn't yet clear. ``The market is still unsure
whether the trend will continue upwards or whether there will be
some profit-taking,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.95 yen to a closing 128.55 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 128.93 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates:
   _1.7865 West German marks, up from 1.7740
   _1.4802 Swiss francs, up from 1.4720
   _6.0285 French francs, up from 5.9747
   _2.0094 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9975
   _1,325.25 Italian lire, up from 1,314.50
   _1.2070 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2100
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7648 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7710 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $448.40 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $447.60. Both were down from Wednesday's late
bid of $448.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $447.80, down from $448.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.68 to close at a bid $449.78.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.99 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $7.06.

   A former state highway patrolman faces possible
life imprisonment for strangling a motorist whose death exposed his
habit of stopping young female drivers for lingering talks in the
dark.
   Craig Peyer, 38, of Poway, a California Highway Patrol officer
for 13 years, was convicted Wednesday in his second trial for the
on-duty murder of Cara Knott, 20, of El Cajon.
   A prosecution case strengthened through hindsight and the
inability of the defense to establish an alibi were the chief
reasons cited by lawyers for the jury's first-degree murder finding
after five days of deliberations. Peyer's first trial ended with a
hung jury Feb. 25.
   ``Holes closed in the second trial,'' District Attorney Ed
Miller said.
   ``The jury came to the conclusion that there was an overwhelming
abundance of evidence. I think what we've demonstrated is the
system works, justice has been served, and no one is above the
law,'' he said.
   Regarded as an exemplary officer before his Jan. 15, 1987,
arrest, Peyer was fired after an internal investigation. He is
appealing the firing.
   Peyer was the second officer in the 58-year history of the
agency to be charged with killing a motorist while on duty.
   ``He is crushed. He wants to appeal,'' said Peyer's attorney,
Robert Grimes.
   Peyer was convicted of strangling Knott, a San Diego State
University student, after pulling her car over on Dec. 27, 1986, as
she drove home along Interstate 15.
   Knott's abandoned car was found in a cul-de-sac near an offramp
of I-15, and her body was found in a creek bed beneath an old
highway bridge nearby. She had been strangled before being thrown
off the 65-foot bridge.
   Knott was described by the prosecutor as a careful young woman
who was trained in self-defense and who may have grown suspicious
of Peyer's actions and prompted him to kill her.
   During retrial, jurors heard testimony from 121 prosecution
witnesses, including two dozen women motorists who recalled their
encounters with Peyer. The former officer never made any sexual
advances, and was described by some as helpful and polite while
others said they were scared and uncomfortable.
   Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman scheduled sentencing for
July 20, and Peyer faces a prison term of 25 years to life. Grimes
said he would appeal the verdict at the sentencing.
   Peyer, who was free on $250,000 bail, was taken into custody
immediately after the verdict.
   ``We recognize the extraordinary courage of the witnesses who
came forward and through their soul-searching revealed the truth,''
said Knott's father, Samuel. ``We put our trust in the criminal
justice system and feel justice has finally been served.''
   Peyer's wife, Karen, vowed to stand by her husband.
   ``As a family, we're sticking together side by side,'' Mrs.
Peyer said outside the couple's house. ``It's a really tough time
for us, but we always remain a family and I trust totally in the
Lord Jesus Christ.''

   T.E. Utley, who lost his eyesight as a child and
went on to become one of Britain's leading conservative
journalists, has died, The Times of London and the Daily Telegraph
announced today. He was 67.
   Utley, who died Tuesday, worked for The Daily Telegraph, voice
of British conservatism, for 21 years, rising to the posts of
assistant editor and chief editorial writer.
   His essays and analyses won him respect as an oracle of
conservative ideology and a scholar of the Northern Ireland
question.
   Born Thomas Edwin Utley, he took the byline T.E. Utley but was
known throughout the newspaper world as Peter. Blinded by disease
at age 9, he adopted the black eyepatch that became his hallmark,
taught himself Braille and graduated from Oxford University with
honors.
   Utley reveled in poking fun at his handicap, often insisting
that as far as he could remember, cars still had running boards. He
spurned the white stick, preferring to be led about by promising
young journalists whose careers he wanted to promote.
   He retired from the Telegraph in 1985 and moved to The Times as
columnist and obituaries editor _ a move that sparked a battle
between the two great London dailies for the title of obituarist of
record.
   Both papers ran his death notice on the front page.
   Asked recently how he would headline his own obituary, Utley
replied: ``Hoist with his own petard,'' a line from ``Hamlet''
meaning destroyed by one's own poison.
   The Times did not oblige, preferring to headline him as
``defender of traditional values in politics and religion.''
   Utley is survived by his wife, Brigid, whom he married in 1951,
and four children.

<HEAD>China Says Proposals By Dalai Lama Are Unacceptable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today rejected a proposal made by Tibet's
exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, that would have recognized its
control of Tibet's foreign affairs in exchange for limited
independence for the remote region.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing,
said it was ``irrefutable'' that Tibet is an inseparable part of
Chinese territory.
   ``Therefore, to have independence or semi-independence will go
nowhere in Tibet. It is not tolerable or acceptable and even a sort
of independence in a disguised form is not acceptable,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama, who fled to exile in India after a failed 1959
uprising against China, made the proposal last week in Strasbourg,
France.
   It was significant in that it acknowledged Chinese interests in
Tibet and granted China the right to keep troops in Tibet and run
the region's foreign affairs.
   The Dalai Lama said he proposed a ``middle way'' in which Tibet
would be a self-governing entity in association with China.
   The proposal was seen as a major concession by the Dalai Lama,
who in the past has called for the total independence of Tibet.
Last fall and again in March monks loyal to the Dalai Lama led
bloody anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.
   Sources in the Office of Tibet in New York said many Tibetans
were unhappy with the Dalai Lama's new proposal and had hoped he
would not give in to the Chinese. In his Strasbourg speech, the
exiled Tibetan leader acknowledged his proposal might be
controversial within the Tibetan community.
   Li today accused the Dalai Lama of attempting to
internationalize the Tibet question.
   ``We oppose any action or activities to be taken by Dalai Lama
in foreign countries which are detrimental to the unification of
the motherland and the national unity,'' he said.
   The Buddhist spiritual leader made his proposal during a private
visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. He was not invited
to address the body because of the parliament's concern for
maintaining good relations with China.
   After the speech, China canceled several visits to China planned
by Parliament members.
   Beijing strongly criticized the U.S. Congress for inviting the
Dalai Lama to testify on conditions in Tibet last fall, shortly
before the outbreak of rioting in Lhasa.
   ``We are also opposed to any foreign organizations or personage
who provides a forum for Dalai Lama to make statements which are
detrimental to national unity,'' Li said.
   Asked if there were any good points in the Dalai Lama's
proposal, Li would only say that Tibet ``is entirely a matter of
the Chinese internal affairs.''

   A man suspected of trapping thousands of pigeons
and selling them to poultry markets has had his own wings clipped
by the Parks Department.
   Domiano Parasmo, 73, of Brooklyn, was taken into custody by a
park enforcement patrolman Wednesday morning and issued a summons
for violating parks regulations that make it a crime to trap birds
or animals in parks.
   Bill Dalton, the Parks Department's chief of citywide
enforcement, sent Parasmo home after he promised to leave the
pigeons alone.
   ``I told him I would check with the people who complained and
maybe we'll drop the charges,'' Dalton said.
   ``(Parks) Commissioner (Henry) Stern doesn't want to prosecute
an elderly gentleman,'' Dalton said. ``He wants him to stop
trapping pigeons.''
   Parasmo has been issued summonses by the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals three times and in each case, the
hearing judge dismissed the charges. There is no law against
trapping wildlife on city streets, as long as it is done humanely.
   However, Parks Department regulations say it is a crime to
``molest, chase, wound, trap, hunt, shoot, throw missiles at, kill,
remove or (possess)'' any bird from a city park.

   Scientists, medicine men and farmers have long
sought ways to make it rain on command. While that day may be
nearer, rainmaking cannot yet offer hope for breaking the drought
gripping America.
   Experiments have shown that cloud seeding ``can offer a modest
increase in what precipitation does fall, but it would not break a
drought or anything like that,'' said meteorologist Michael R.
Poellot of the University of North Dakota.
   Studies ``suggest man's ability to modify precipitation is
really quite minor,'' added Roscoe R. Braham, who teaches
meteorology at the University of Chicago.
   ``We're not dealing with a minor problem in the drought, we're
dealing with a major catastrophe,'' Braham said. ``There's no
reason to think cloud seeding could do anything to ameliorate the
dry conditions that we have.''
   Even Tom Henderson, president of Atmospherics Inc., in Fresno,
Calif., the nation's largest cloud-seeding company, conceded that
``weather modification, as a cure-all for drought situations, is
probably not a very viable technology.''
   Bruce Boe, director of the North Dakota Atmospheric Resource
Board, which operates a weather modification program in that state,
held out hope that ``something can be done.'' But, he noted, ``in a
drought, the opportunities are less.''
   Seeding ``might shorten the length of a drought a bit, but you
will not see a dramatic result from it in most cases.'' he said.
   Poellot reported that cloud-seeding experiments have increased
rainfall by as much as 10 percent. But, he noted, ``for cloud
seeding to work, it needs some clouds. So if there are no clouds,
you're out of luck.'' That same thought was echoed by the other
meteorologists.
   ``The atmosphere just does not have any clouds in it; we've been
totally cloud free,'' Braham said.
   ``We've been in the field since June 1, but we've flown very
litte,'' added Boe, whose agency operates an airborne cloud-seeding
program covering 6.6 million acres of western North Dakota.
   North Dakota spends about $1.5 million per two-year budget cycle
on weather modification, half from the state and half from a tax
voted by residents of the counties affected.
   Henderson said that the cost of running a commercial four-month
summertime cloud-seeding program covering 3,000 to 5,000 acres in
the Midwest would typically run from $100,000 to $125,000.
   Making it rain has obsessed mankind for thousands of years, and
many hoped for a breakthrough a few decades ago when the first
successes were achieved.
   In 1946, Vincent J. Schaefer accomplished the goal, although he
actually made it snow, rather than rain.
   Through the centuries, all sorts of less scientific methods had
been attempted, including animal sacrifice, setting out pots of
water, calling on various gods, clashing armor, ringing church
bells and even firing artillery into the sky.
   Schaefer, in a famous Nov. 13, 1946, experiment near
Schenectady, N.Y., sprinkled three pounds of ground dry ice into a
cloud and within minutes snowflakes formed, and a hole appeared in
the cloud.
   A lot of experimentation was done in the 1970s, sponsored by
state and federal governments, but there has been relatively little
scientific work on changing the weather in the 1980s.
   That is partly because of reductions in money available for the
work and partly because ``the scientists succeeded in defining the
situations where rainfall increases looked feasible and those where
it didn't look so feasible, and the window of opportunity kept
getting smaller and smaller,'' Braham said.
   Boe stressed that any cloud-seeding program has to be a
continuing one.
   ``If you're going to start a weather modification program to
deal with drought, and when it's over you bag the program, you're
taking the wrong tack,'' he said. Long-term cloud seeding adds to
the deep ground moisture, and can help resist the damage of
droughts.

<TEXT>
   Newly elected Prime Minsiter Do Muoi
said today that Hanoi is trying to end its international isolation
by seeking to end its 9-year-old military occupation of Cambodia.
   The official Voice of Vietnam radio quoted Do Muoi as saying
Vietnam may withdraw all of its troops from Cambodia before 1990.
   According to the broadcast, Do Muoi said that ``to widen
cooperation, first of all, it is necessary to maintain peace and
security. Vietnam is striving to solve the Cambodian issue.''
   Do Muoi, 71, was elected on Wednesday.
   Many non-communist Western and Asian countries have denied
economic aid to Vietnam and otherwise isolated the communist nation
to protest its late 1978 invasion and continuing occupation of
Cambodia.
   Vietnam has said it will remove all its estimated 120,000 troops
by 1990, and plans a pullout of about 50,000 troops this year.
Today's announcement was the first time a Vietnamese leader said
the withdrawal could be completed before that date.
   Hanoi-based diplomats say that under a new pragmatic leadership
that has given top priority to economic development, Vietnam has
made a series of diplomatic initiatives on Cambodia, which not long
ago was a non-negotiable issue.
   Vietnam recently decided to send Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach to attend unprecedented peace talks involving Cambodian
guerrilla factions next month in Indonesia.
   In a speech Wednesday, Do Muoi pledged to continue Vietnam's
Western-style economic reforms to revive an economy Communist
authorities said they weakened through indecisiveness and poor
planning.
   An official Radio Hanoi report seen in Bangkok today quoted Do
Muoi as telling the National Assembly he will ``thoroughly grasp
the renovative spirit'' of resolutions adopted at a December 1986
party congress.
   The resolutions liberalized Vietnam's economy by allowing a
measure of free enterprise and opening up the country to foreign
investment.
   In a report to the assembly Wednesday, Vo Van Kiet, the acting
premier, said people were ``deeply worried'' about rampant
inflation, chaos in the distribution of goods and acute food
shortages in the northern provinces.
   Vietnamese sources had said Do Muoi was the most likely choice
as premier because he is a disciplinarian who can crack down on the
corruption and inefficiency among cadres involved in implementing
economic reforms.
   Some diplomats say the choice of Do Muoi could slow down the
reform momentum, sending a wrong signal to the average Vietnamese,
who preferred Kiet, 66, a pioneer of economic reform.
   Kiet was first vice premier before becoming acting premier after
Pham Hung's death. The radio report did not say whether he would
return to the old post.
   Do Muoi is the third-ranking member of the Politburo, the top
policy-making body. He gave up the vice premiership last year after
becoming the No. 2 man in the party secretariat, where he is said
to have directed a purge of inept and corrupt elements in the
1.8-million-member party.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1939 and held key party and
government posts during the struggle against the French
colonialists, the Americans and South Vietnam.

<HEAD>Central Committee May Get New Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New members of the policy-making Central Committee
may be chosen at a national party conference next week, but most of
the sessions will be closed to the public, a Soviet official
indicated today.
   Yuri A. Sklyarov of the Communist Party Central Committee's
Propaganda Department told a news conference that the 5,000
delegates to next week's conference could have the right to elect
new members to the 300-plus Central Committee.
   The new members could replace the 60 to 70 members who have died
or have become so-called ``dead souls'' by losing the positions
that gave them the right to spots on the committee.
   Sklyarov refused to say definitely, however, whether new people
would make it onto the Central Committee or other leading party
organs.
   He was similarly vague about many details of procedure and
agenda for the conference scheduled to open Tuesday. It will be the
first since 1941.
   Sklyarov confirmed a report in the government daily Izvestia
that only the opening and closing sessions of the conference would
be broadcast live on national television, with other coverage
limited to summaries of conference speeches.
   That is likely to disappoint the many reformers who have
published demands in the state-run media for full television
coverage.
   Yegor Yakovlev, editor of the reformist weekly Moscow News, said
Wednesday about 70 delegates were likely to take the floor during
the conference, which government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov has
said will run from June 28 to July 1.
   Sklyarov refused to confirm that timetable, saying only the
conference could decide how long it would sit. He also tried to
suggest there was no fixed number of speakers, saying the presidium
would give the floor to speakers in the order they ask for it.
   Sklyarov said speakers would have the right to amend their
remarks for the written record.
   ``It is up to the delegate himself to decide what his remarks
will look like,'' Sklyarov said. ``That's his right.''
   Sklyarov said ``the most prestigious workers of the various
party organs'' will get together before the conference opens to
decide who should sit on the agenda-setting presidium.
   The restricted coverage of the party conference is similar to
the access at the previous party congress in 1986. As at that
forum, party leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will give an opening
report followed by selected speakers.
   Gorbachev's speech is supposed to outline his further plans to
reform the economy and open up the party and society.
   There has been a growing feeling among Moscow intellectuals in
recent days that the party conference will not be a reform-setting
gathering, as was predicted several months ago, but rather a dress
rehearsal for the next regular party congress in 1991.
   Gorbachev had said in May he wanted conference delegates to be
strong partisans of perestroika, his term for the restructing of
Soviet society. But public protests in various Soviet cities over
undemocratic delegate selection, and the failure of some prominent
reformers to be elected delegates, indicate conservative party
forces have put a brake on the conference as originally envisaged.

   School systems comprised of inner-city
neighborhoods and suburbs that bus students for racial balance are
the most successful at maintaining integrated schools, a study
concludes.
   The finding is one of several contained in a report released
Wednesday at the annual meeting of the National School Boards
Association.
   ``That was one of the more interesting findings, given the
fierce battling that goes on over desegregation,'' said political
scientist Gary Orfield of the University of Chicago. ``The
perception is often that reassigning students to other
neighborhoods encourages `white flight.'''
   ``But the places that have been most successful _ Nashville, Las
Vegas, Nev., most every big city in Florida except Miami _ have
been those where the city and suburbs are in the same district and
you can implement a districtwide desegregation plan,'' Orfield said.
   Researchers, led by Orfield and political scientist Franklin
Monfort of the University of Wisconsin, analyzed data from the 60
largest public school systems between 1967 and 1986.
   They concluded the schools have become increasingly segregated
over that period because of a dramatic rise in Hispanic students
and a steady erosion in white enrollment.
   ``Predictions about central city districts losing the majority
of their white students came true,'' Orfield said Wednesday, ``but
now, not only are blacks still being segregated, Hispanics are
being more segregated at an even-faster rate.
   ``However, the segregation is not the result of whites leaving
public schools, so much as migration patterns and changes in the
birth rates,'' he added.
   Among the report's most significant findings:
   _Total enrollment declined by 15 percent in the 60 districts to
6.7 million over the 19-year period. White enrollment declined by
16 percent, while the number of black students increased by 5
percent and Hispanic students by 103 percent.
   _The 25 largest central city school districts now serve 28
percent of all black students, 30 percent of all Hispanics, but
only 3 percent of white students.
   ``What that means,'' he said, ``is that the school systems that
are decisive to the future of large parts of our minority groups
are almost irrelevant to the white population.''
   _Almost half of the largest public school districts are now in
the suburbs and metropolitan counties alongside urban centers.
   The researchers did not attempt to assess the consequences of
segregation or to propose solutions.
   But Orfield said: ``Schools that serve black and Hispanic
populations exclusively serve a disproportionate number of poor
kids. They continue to do much worse than white schools in academic
achievement, graduation rates, and almost any other measure of
providing a successful education.
   ``And the worst part,'' he added, ``is that almost nothing
substantial is being done to change it.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Japan Will Play More Active International Role</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita says his
country is determined to play a more active global leadership role
equal with its economic superpower status.
   In his first visit to America's industrial heartland Wednesday,
Takeshita also defended his country's burgeoning investments in the
United States, saying they have created jobs.
   Acknowledging that some Americans view Japan's investments in
the United States as a threat, Takeshita said they have created
more than 200,000 jobs and would help improve the U.S. trade
balance.
   Takeshita visited Chicago one day after the close of the
economic summit of the leaders of seven major industrialized
countries in Toronto, Canada.
   The prime minister said he hoped his visit to ``the hub of
America's heartland'' would contribute ``to broader and deeper
Japan-U.S. relations.''
   Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Japan-America Society of
Chicago, Takeshita quipped that he hoped a fireworks display
scheduled afterward over Lake Michigan would ``shake the sky above
and help bring ... some rain'' to the drought-stricken region.
   Takeshita echoed the same themes he sounded at the summit, at
which Japan offered a plan for Third World debt relief and signaled
its willingness to accept the international leadership role that
goes with its economic power.
   Takeshita, who became prime minister in November, said,
``Playing an active role commensurate with our national strength
responds both to Japan's interests and to the expectations of the
peoples of the world.''
   ``I have therefore set, as the highest goal of my
administration, the building of a Japan contributing more to the
world,'' he told about 1,000 dinner guests at the Fairmont Hotel,
including Gov. James R. Thompson, Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer and
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.
   Takeshita outlined what he called Japan's ``International
Cooperation Initiative,'' under which Japan would increase cultural
exchanges, take part in peace-keeping actions and offer debt-relief
to developing countries.
   Takeshita said Japan's official development assistance,
announced at the Toronto summit, would total $50 billion for fiscal
years 1988-92, more than double the sum for the previous five years.
   By next year, he predicted that Japan would surpass the United
States as the world's largest development assistance donor.
   The Japanese government has recently drawn up a new five-year
economic plan that ``is in harmony with the world economy'' by
boosting domestic demand and opening up the Japanese market to
imports, Takeshita said.
   He said the agreement announced this week to liberalize Japanese
imports of beef and citrus fruit should lead to a further expansion
of agricultural trade between the United States and Japan, the
world's biggest purchaser of U.S. farm products.
   Takeshita also said Americans had no reason to be pessimistic
about their country's future.
   ``No country can replace the United States in its central role
as the leader of the West,'' said Takeshita, whose speech in
Japanese was simultaneously translated into English through
headphones.
   ``A strong America is essential for Japan's future.''

   Fires that appeared set by Arab arsonists lit
up the night in rural areas and a widespread power outage darkened
Israeli cities and the occupied territories this morning, officials
said.
   The blackout left major Israeli cities and the occupied Gaza
Strip and West Bank without power for three hours. Authorities were
investigating the outage but had ruled out sabotage.
   In mostly Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian high school students
today stoned two Israeli buses, slightly injuring several
passengers and smashing one front windshield, Israel radio
reported. The radio said Arab schoolgirls also stoned Israel
vehicles on the area's main shopping thoroughfare.
   The radio did not specify how many bus passengers were hurt and
the police spokesman was not in his office.
   Also today, the army said Israeli troops arrested a
knife-wielding Palestinian shepherd who allegedly tried to stab an
Israeli in the same West Bank area where an Israeli was bludgeoned
to death Monday.
   An army helicopter chased the shepherd Wednesday after he tried
to stab an Israeli official who told him to leave a restricted
military zone near the communal farming settlement of Shekef, the
army said.
   On Wednesday, a Palestinian was killed and two wounded in
violence, bringing to 211 the number of Arab fatalities in the
6{-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Four Israelis also have died.
   Leaders of the uprising issued one of their most militant
directives Wednesday, urging Arabs to form paramilitary ``strike
forces,'' to destroy Israeli property and attack Palestinians who
collaborate with the Israelis.
   The authors of leaflet No. 20 called for two general strikes,
including one on Tuesday, the 21st anniversary of the annexation of
Arab east Jerusalem after its capture by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   At about 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EDT) power suddenly went out in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the West Bank cities of Nablus and Bethlehem,
and the Gaza Strip.
   ``We don't know what happened, but we're checking it,'' police
spokesman Rafi Levi told The Associated Press on an emergency
telephone line during the outage.
   A spokesman for the Israel Electrical Corp., Avri Ravid, told
Israel radio that sabotage was ruled out. Ravid said officials were
still investigating the cause.
   
   Palestinian leaders had designated Wednesday ``Arson Day,''
directing Arabs to set fire to Israeli farmland, forests and
factories to protest the 21-year-old Israeli occupation.
   Israeli officials, who mobilized thousands of firefighters and
volunteers to meet the threat, said about 15 blazes were reported
Wednesday but the figures were still being compiled. At least 10
were blamed on arson.
   Overnight fires broke out in Tel Aviv and nearby Petah Tikva.
   In Tel Aviv, a blaze gutted a knitwear factory on the top floor
of a three-story building, said fire department spokesman Eitan
Cohen.
   He said the blaze was under investigation but the daily Haaretz
quoted police as saying it was arson.
   Israel army radio said another fire broke out at a factory that
produces cooking oil in Petah Tikva. It said police were
investigating the cause.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev blamed some blazes on Israeli
children. He said three 9-year-old Israelis were caught setting
fires ``just for the fun of it ... Now the Arab children who do it,
some of their motives are the same, and some are being sent,
sometimes for money.''
   So far this year, about 35,000 acres of forests and fields have
been wiped out by fire, about 10 times last year's total.
   Police spokesman Yehoshua Goldapfel reported more than 330 cases
of arson from January to June, including about 130 fires linked to
the Arab uprising.
   The number of fires set by Palestinians has risen steadily, from
about 40 percent of the blazes in January to 80 percent in June, he
said.
   Destruction of trees is especially painful in Israel, where much
effort has been put into turning arid lands into woods and farms.
Many of Israel's trees have been donated by American Jews.

   Burning phosphorus from a derailed tanker
spread a toxic cloud across five Kentucky counties, driving
thousands of residents from their homes before it began dissipating
today.
   The phosphorus burst into flames in 99-degree heat late
Wednesday when 34 cars of a CSX Transportation Corp. train derailed
and the chemical leaked from one car. The fire burned itself out
shortly after dawn today.
   ``It's very, very much dissipating,'' state police Trooper Bryan
Pitney said today. ``It's not as dense as it was. It's not as
irritable.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration this morning lifted a
restriction imposed overnight on all air travel at or below 2,000
feet in the area. State officials temporarily closed some roads.
   The only remaining fire this morning was a minor brush fire
nearby, officials said.
   Phosphorus fires cannot be extinguished with water and must burn
themselves out, said Don Armstrong, spokesman for the state
Disaster and Emergency Services in Frankfort.
   Bob L. Cart, CSX superintendent of operations for the Chicago
division, said the railroad had been given permission to begin
clearing cars on the south end of the derailment. He said the
derailment's cause was not known.
   Most of the 2,500 people in six area communities in western
Kentucky were evacuated Wednesday night, Armstrong said. Between 40
and 50 people were treated in area hospitals for respiratory and
other problems, according to medical officials.
   However, many residents began returning home by this morning
even though the evacuation order had only been lifted in one of
three counties.
   White phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air
temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees, said Dr. George Rodgers of the
Poison Control Center in Louisville. Temperatures in western
Kentucky hovered in the 99-degree range on Wednesday and were
forecast to reach the upper 90s today, the National Weather Service
said.
   The cloud, which contains an acid emitted in the phosphorus
smoke, can burn human skin and, if inhaled, the nose and lungs,
Rodgers said.
   Emergency officials went door-to-door in the towns Wednesday
night, warning residents of the chemical plume and, in some cases,
advising them to leave. Temporary shelters were set up in schools
and churches.
   Many evacuees suffered from respiratory problems and burning
eyes and were treated with oxygen, said Lanny Woodward, principal
of South Hopkins High School in Nortonville, where about 500 people
were sheltered.
   ``I could taste it. My tongue got real tingly,'' said Ruth
Blakeley, 67, of White Plains, who was spending the night at the
school.

   Fires that appeared set by Arab arsonists lit
up the night in rural areas and a widespread power outage darkened
Israeli cities and the occupied territories this morning, officials
said.
   The blackout left major Israeli cities and the occupied Gaza
Strip and West Bank without power for three hours. Authorities were
investigating the outage but had ruled out sabotage.
   In mostly Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinian high school students
today stoned two Israeli buses, slightly injuring several
passengers and smashing one front windshield, Israel radio
reported. The radio said Arab schoolgirls also stoned Israel
vehicles on the area's main shopping thoroughfare.
   The radio did not specify how many bus passengers were hurt and
the police spokesman was not in his office.
   Also today, the army said Israeli troops arrested a
knife-wielding Palestinian shepherd who allegedly tried to stab an
Israeli in the same West Bank area where an Israeli was bludgeoned
to death Monday.
   An army helicopter chased the shepherd Wednesday after he tried
to stab an Israeli official who told him to leave a restricted
military zone near the communal farming settlement of Shekef, the
army said.
   On Wednesday, a Palestinian was killed and two wounded in
violence, bringing to 211 the number of Arab fatalities in the
6{-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Four Israelis also have died.
   Leaders of the uprising issued one of their most militant
directives Wednesday, urging Arabs to form paramilitary ``strike
forces,'' to destroy Israeli property and attack Palestinians who
collaborate with the Israelis.
   The authors of leaflet No. 20 called for two general strikes,
including one on Tuesday, the 21st anniversary of the annexation of
Arab east Jerusalem after its capture by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   At about 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EDT) power suddenly went out in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the West Bank cities of Nablus and Bethlehem,
and the Gaza Strip.
   ``We don't know what happened, but we're checking it,'' police
spokesman Rafi Levi told The Associated Press on an emergency
telephone line during the outage.
   A spokesman for the Israel Electrical Corp., Avri Ravid, told
Israel radio that sabotage was ruled out. Ravid said officials were
still investigating the cause.
   
   Palestinian leaders had designated Wednesday ``Arson Day,''
directing Arabs to set fire to Israeli farmland, forests and
factories to protest the 21-year-old Israeli occupation.
   Israeli officials, who mobilized thousands of firefighters and
volunteers to meet the threat, said about 15 blazes were reported
Wednesday but the figures were still being compiled. At least 10
were blamed on arson.
   Overnight fires broke out in Tel Aviv and nearby Petah Tikva.
   In Tel Aviv, a blaze gutted a knitwear factory on the top floor
of a three-story building, said fire department spokesman Eitan
Cohen.
   He said the blaze was under investigation but the daily Haaretz
quoted police as saying it was arson.
   Israel army radio said another fire broke out at a factory that
produces cooking oil in Petah Tikva. It said police were
investigating the cause.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev blamed some blazes on Israeli
children. He said three 9-year-old Israelis were caught setting
fires ``just for the fun of it ... Now the Arab children who do it,
some of their motives are the same, and some are being sent,
sometimes for money.''
   So far this year, about 35,000 acres of forests and fields have
been wiped out by fire, about 10 times last year's total.
   Police spokesman Yehoshua Goldapfel reported more than 330 cases
of arson from January to June, including about 130 fires linked to
the Arab uprising.
   The number of fires set by Palestinians has risen steadily, from
about 40 percent of the blazes in January to 80 percent in June, he
said.
   Destruction of trees is especially painful in Israel, where much
effort has been put into turning arid lands into woods and farms.
Many of Israel's trees have been donated by American Jews.

<HEAD>Company To Conduct Human Tests of AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMERYVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A third U.S. company says it will
begin human testing of a prototype AIDS vaccine designed to protect
people not infected with the deadly virus.
   Chiron Corp. said Wednesday that tests on humans will start in
Switzerland in the initial step in clinical studies that could last
10 years.
   The tests are being conducted by Biocine Co., a joint venture of
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy Corp., a New York subsidiary of a Swiss
pharmaceuticals giant.
   The first clinical trial will involve 20 to 25 healthy Swiss men
who do not carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and AIDS-related complex. Biocine said it is now selecting
the participants.
   It is the first human testing of a prospective AIDS vaccine in
Europe and may expand to the United States within a year, said
Ginger Rosenberg, a Chiron spokeswoman.
   Two other companies in the United States _ Oncogen in Seattle
and MicroGeneSys of Connecticut _ already have begun human trials
on AIDS vaccines in the United States.
   Chiron said it has already conducted tests on chimps, goats,
rabbits and guinea pigs.
   But ``since animals do not get AIDS, animal studies provide
limited information about the ability of a vaccine to generate a
protective immunity against the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Dino Dina,
director of Chiron's virology program. ``Much of what we nee to
know about the vaccine's effectiveness must await the results of
our initial human studies.''
   Typically, it takes five to 10 years to test a prospective
vaccine, he said.

   Police cordoned off Burma's holiest
Buddhist shrine at dawn today and surrounded student demonstrators
who had set up a ``strike center'' on its grounds.
   The closing of gates leading to the Shwedagon Pagoda, a
centuries-old hilltop shrine, comes after students angered by
authorities' closing of their schools fought riot police in the
capital's streets.
   A dawn-to-dusk curfew was imposed in Rangoon after Tuesday's
clashes, in which state radio said nine people were killed and 77
arrested.
   Following the closure of the Rangoon Institute of Technology
Wednesday morning, students from the campus went to the Shwedagon
and opened a ``strike center.'' The pagoda's central tower is
covered with several tons of gold.
   Some pilgrims returning from the pagoda Wednesday said about 500
students were on its grounds. The figure could not to be confirmed,
and details of what occured in the pagoda after the gates were shut
were not available.
   Classes at key schools in Burma's second largest city, Mandalay,
were suspended today, and a curfew was imposed Wednesday night in
Pegu following mob violence, according to residents reached by
telephone. Pegu is 55 miles north of Rangoon.
   The Pegu residents said demonstrators destroyed some government
buildings, cooperative shops and vehicles in a rampage that began
in front of a high school.
   Residents said there was no unrest in Mandalay, 385 miles north
of Rangoon, and the suspension of classes at Mandalay University,
Medical College and the Government Technical Institute seemed to be
preventive measures.
   The current protests appear to stem from widespread
disatisfaction with the one-party regime of military strongman Ne
Win, who seized power in a 1962 coup. The government has restricted
individual freedoms. And economic conditions in what was once one
of Asia's wealthiest nations have worsened in recent years.
   Most shops in Rangoon's sprawling markets closed at noon today
for fear of looting in the event of renewed unrest and some
government employees left work early.
   Students dressed in green sarongs _ the uniform of high school
students _ tried unsuccessfully to persuade residents in some parts
of the city to join them on a march to the heavily guarded pagoda.
The march did not materialize.
   The government has also banned all processions, demonstrations
and public meetings. The restrictions are to last until Aug. 19.
   Attendance at high schools and the Education Institute _ the
capital's only center of higher learning still open _ was minimal.
Teachers have been instructed to continue classes regardless of the
number of students attending.
   No major incidents have been reported in Rangoon since the
curfew was imposed on Tuesday. A few taxi drivers, tri-shaw
pedallers and street vendors have been arrested for venturing into
the streets before curfew ends at 6 a.m. but have reportedly been
released after a warning.
   The disturbances in the capital erupted Tuesday when about 5,000
students and other protestors fought stone-throwing duels with
police.
   Students at several institutions had peacefully demonstrated
last week for the release of detained students and legalization of
student unions. Violence erupted after the government responded by
closing the schools.
   The country's first riots since 1974 erupted last October when
the government declared invalid much of the currency in circulation
and offered no compensation. On March 18, several days of student
unrest climaxed in a rampage by students and others that was
swiftly crushed by police and military units.
   A government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people
were arrested, many of them since freed. But diplomatic sources
told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that as many as 100 people
died in the March violence.

   Two more escapees from the Kentucky
State Penitentiary were captured after a brief exchange of gunfire
with police in a cornfield in rural central Kentucky, officials
said.
   The two convicted murderers were among eight inmates who escaped
a week ago from the prison at Eddyville. Three were captured
earlier, and officials in Tennessee were awaiting records to
determine whether a man in custody there was another escapee.
   State police Sgt. Mike Sapp said nobody was injured during the
shootout Wednesday that ended with the capture of Ronnie Hudson,
29, and Joseph Montgomery, 27, both of Louisville. Both men were
armed, he said.
   They were caught about two miles east of Campbellsville and only
about 300 feet from a temporary command post that state police had
set up in the parking lot of the Robinson Creek Baptist Church.
   The two were spotted crawling through the field by several
children playing kickball behind the church.
   Sapp said Hudson had dyed his hair red, and Montgomery had cut
his hair.
   ``No, I never thought we'd get caught,'' Montgomery told
television reporters after his capture.
   Late Tuesday night, state police had discovered tote bags
containing bullets, new clothing, canned food, and hair dye
believed dropped by the two fugitives.
   The eight prisoners escaped from the maximum-security prison by
sawing open their cell doors. They cut through a prison window and
climbed down an extension cord while guards were distracted by
fires set elsewhere in the prison by other inmates.
   Officials in Sullivan County, Tenn., said they were checking the
identity of a prisoner there to see if he might be one of the
escapees. The prisoner fits a physical description of the escapee,
but fingerprint records and photographs would not be available
until sometime today, officials said.

   Israel's major cities, the occupied West Bank
and the Gaza Strip lost electrical power today for up to three
hours, but a utility spokesman ruled out sabotage.
   At about 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EDT) power went out in Jerusalem,
Tel Aviv, and as far south as the seaside resort of Eilat on the
Egyptian border.
   Also affected were the occupied West Bank cities of Nablus,
Ramallah and Bethlehem, and the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The Israel Electrical Corp. was investigating the causes, but
company spokesman Avri Ravid told Israel radio about four hours
after the outage that officials had ruled out sabotage.
   Power was restored to most locations after an hour, although Tel
Aviv and some parts of the Gaza Strip remained without electricity
for another two hours.
   Southern District police spokesman Rafi Levi initially told The
Associated Press that police were investigating whether the outage
was a case of sabotage.
   But Ravid later said officials had determined the outage was not
caused deliberately, although they were still were unsure about
what caused the electrical failure.
   Underground leaders of the 6{-month-old Palestinian uprising, in
a leaflet distributed Wednesday, called on Palestinians to
``continue destroying the property of our fascist enemy.''
   The leaflet was one of the most militant directives issued,
urging Arabs to form paramilitary ``strike forces,'' to destroy
Israeli property and attack Palestinians who collaborate with the
Israelis.
   Israeli army officials said they were affected by the power
outage but that the electrical cut did not hamper security
operations in the occupied territories.
   Radio broadcasts appeared unaffected by the outage as stations
apparently switched to emergency power generators.
   In Tel Aviv, long lines formed at banks after computers went
down and tellers had to conduct transactions manually. Outdoor
cafes were packed as shoppers and store owners fled from hot
shopping malls when air conditioning went out.
   Massive traffic jams were reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,
where police directed drivers by hand at major intersections.

   Two years ago, high water levels sent waves
crashing over miles of Great Lakes shoreline, chewing up beaches,
submerging marinas and causing millions of dollars in destruction.
   Today, drought has helped lake water levels drop up to 3 feet
since then _ good news for the suffering recreation industry and
for home owners who feared their property was doomed.
   ``The drought is having a major effect on lake levels,'' said
Frank Quinn, head of lake hydrology at the Great Lakes
Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   If the trend continues, the lakes will drop below their monthly
average levels for the first time in 10 to 15 years.
   Declining water levels have decreased the threat of erosion and
landslides and improved conditions for sunbathers and recreational
boaters, said Quinn, whose lab is operated by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``Our docks are 4 or 5 feet above water level,'' said Patty
Demink, who works at South Haven Municipal Marina. ``When I first
started coming here (two years ago), if it rained the water would
go over the docks.''
   Fred Harrington, 71, said that in 1986, he and his wife feared
their ``dream house,'' which sits 280 feet above Lake Michigan in
South Haven, might slip into the lake.
   ``About 50 feet of our frontage was destroyed in two
landslides,'' Harrington said. ``Now, we feel more confident that
we'll be able to stay here longer.''
   The Great Lakes have dropped 2 feet to 3 feet since their
record-highs in 1986, when waves left lakefront homes teetering on
scooped-out bluffs. On June 17, Lake Michigan was 31 inches lower
than it was in October 1986, Quinn said.
   In the last month, lakes Michigan and Huron dropped 2 inches,
Erie dropped 3 inches, Superior stayed the same and Ontario went up
an inch, he said.
   Lakes Michigan and Erie peaked in the first half of April and
have been steady or falling since, Quinn said.
   In an average year, the lakes do not peak until July or August,
but hot, dry weather has caused much water to evaporate, Quinn said.
   Even if the drought ends, most of the moisture from much-needed
rain would be absorbed by the parched soil and little would run
into the Great Lakes.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has considered diverting some water
from Lake Michigan to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which
have been drying up in the drought.
   ``Changing the diversions would only change the lake levels by a
matter of a couple of inches,'' Quinn said.
   A 1929 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a lawsuit, however, set
limits on how much water could be diverted from the lake into the
river system. The lawsuit was brought against Illinois by other
Great Lakes states and Canada, said Ross Fredenburg, a spokesman
for the North Central Division of the corps of engineers.
   Since then, the Supreme Court must be petitioned to change the
limit. The latest came in 1980 when the court said 3,200 cubic feet
per second could be diverted.
   William Wente, executive director of Wilmette Harbor, north of
Chicago, said although he is glad the water has dropped from levels
that swamped his marina two years ago, the shrinking trend has
drawbacks.
   ``We're a good 3 or 4 inches from where we were a month ago,''
he said. ``We've had to do a lot more dredging here in the harbor
entrance, and it's costing us more.''
   ``If it continues at this rate, it's going to be trouble in a
couple of years,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Pravda said today that soldiers have been deployed
in several cities of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the
site of massive ethnic protests.
   The Communist Party newspaper warned that those responsible for
the ethnic unrest in the southern republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan eventually would be held responsible for their actions.
   ``In the past days, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh has become
even more tense,'' Pravda said in a report from Stepanakert, the
main city of the disputed region.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has belonged to Azerbaijan since 1923, but
Armenians consider it part of their ancestral homeland and are
demanding that it be incorporated into Armenia. The majority of its
160,000 residents are Armenian.
   ``The migration of Armenian families to Armenia and Azerbaijanis
from Armenia to Azerbaijan is continuing. In a number of cities,
including those of Nagorno-Karabakh, soldiers have been brought
in,'' Pravda said.
   A general strike and daily meetings and demonstrations are
continuing in Nagorno-Karabakh, Pravda said.
   It did not say where the soldiers have been deployed, but Moscow
dissidents showed film Monday of soldiers protecting the Armenian
section of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
   Reports said eight Armenians and eight Azerbaijanis were injured
last week in fights in two Armenian villages, Masis and Sayat Nova.
   ``Those who put the long friendship of the two nations in
danger, sooner or later must be held accountable,'' Pravda said.
   ``Only quiet, restraint, a clear understanding of the current
situation can prevent extremely undesirable consequences,'' it said.
   Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh have been agitating since February
to have their territory annexed to Armenia.
   The governments of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia have backed the
demand, but Azerbaijan has refused to go along. National officials
have offered an economic and social development plan.
   Officials say 32 people, six Azerbaijanis and 26 Armenians, were
killed in rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at the end of
February and beginning of March.
   Pravda said a general strike that began May 23 in Stepanakert
has led to despair among some residents, but they cannot back down.
   ``Many understand the senselessness and absurdity of their
method of self-exhaustion, but there is nothing they can do. The
affair has gone too far.''
   On Wednesday, a resident of Stepanakert said some residents had
been persuaded to return to work by their legislature's request to
central authorities to approve the annexation request.
   The resident said about half of the estimated 30,000 strikers
remained off their jobs.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
Wednesday that the annexation request would be taken up by the
Presidium of the national Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's
highest legislative body, but that it probably would not be
discussed in the near future.

   A couple described as friendly and
church-going and their 11-year-old daughter were slain by a
shotgun-wielding assailant, and police arrested the couple's
14-year-old son in the killings, authorities said.
   Detective Lt. Bruce Naile of the Oakland County sheriff's
department declined to speculate on a motive for Wedneday night's
slayings of Michael and Carol Carnell and their daughter, Candace.
   Their bodies were discovered by police on the kitchen floor of
the Carnells' home about 3{ miles north of Davisburg in
northwestern Oakland County, said Naile.
   Mrs. Carnell, whose age was unavailable, and her daughter were
dead at the scene, he said. Carnell, 35, was pronounced dead at
Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital.
   The boy was at the house and offered no resistance, Naile said.
He was being held in Oakland County Children's Village while
authorities sought warrants charging him with three counts each of
open murder and use of a firearm during commission of a felony.
   Divers recovered a shotgun believed to have been used in the
slayings from a pond behind the home, the detective said.
   An unidentified neighbor told The Oakland Press of Pontiac that
the boy ran to her house about the time of the shootings.
   ``The boy pounded on my door and said he needed help,'' the
woman said. ``He said, `Someone shot my mom and dad and they are
after me.' He was a very frightened young kid. I turned the outdoor
light on. I said, `Don't worry, I'll call the police.'''
   The woman said police advised her not to let the boy inside.
   Police said the boy initially told them his family had been shot
by two men, the newspaper said.
   Another neighbor, who was not identified, told the newspaper
that the Carnells had lived in the small ranch house for five years
after Michael Carnell bought it from his father.
   ``They go to church almost every night,'' the neighbor said.
``They are very nice people. They never hurt anybody. They were
friendly. Carol was very nice. Everytime they go somewhere, their
children were with them. The children go to Springfield Christian
School.''

   Attorneys for three men convicted of
smuggling a bomb into the United States say they won't appeal the
prison terms of up to 16 years given to their clients.
   The government alleged the three men, who are natives of Lebanon
and hold Canadian citizenship, are members of a Syrian political
group responsible for several acts of terrorism.
   But U.S. District Judge Albert Coffrin told the men Wednesday it
didn't matter to him whether they belonged to an extremist
political party; his concern was that the explosive device they had
been carrying could have caused serious damage.
   ``The lethal potential, however, is clear,'' Coffrin said. ``Any
victim of a bombing is an innocent victim.''
   Defendant Georges Younan and co-defendant Walid Kabbani each
received a 16-year sentence in federal prison. Walid Mourad, who
pleaded guilty one day before the others went to trial, was
sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Younan had faced the stiffest penalty, up to 35 years in prison.
Mourad had faced 10 years in prison, and Kabbani, 30 years and six
months.
   Younan and Kabbani pleaded innocent but never testified at their
trial. None of the three addressed Coffrin during the sentencing
hearing. Instead, they chose to have their attorneys speak for them.
   ``He says, `I'm not a terrorist,''' Kabbani's attorney Mark
Keller said. ``He simply says, `I know what I am.' ... He asked me
not to beg on his behalf, not to grovel on his behalf.''
   The defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences, saying
the government had proposed a plea bargain in which 20-year prison
terms were offered in exchange for a guilty plea and cooperation
with the government.
   The three were arrested last October and charged with smuggling
a homemade bomb into the United States through Richford, a small
town on the Vermont-Canadian border. The U.S. government claimed
the three were members of a terrorist group responsible for the
1982 assassination of a Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel.
   Their attorneys described them as mere bunglers as opposed to
professional terrorists.
   U.S. Attorney George Terwilliger III and the FBI, however, said
the three men are members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.
The group was founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and was
devoted to the formation of ``Greater Syria'' that encompassed
several Middle East nations.
   Younan's cousin says Younan is a member of the party, but denied
that it was a terrorist group. Attorneys for Kabbani and Mourad
denied their clients were members at all.
   Terwilliger said he felt the sentence was appropriate. ``It's
one of a very few incidents involving a person associated with
Middle Eastern terrorist organization actually being in possession
of explosives on U.S. soil,'' he said.

   A member of Conway Twitty's entourage was
seriously injured when a pickup truck sideswiped the country
singer's tour bus and hit a car driven by the victim, the Highway
Patrol said.
   The pickup truck was traveling west in the eastbound lane of
U.S. 60 near Mansfield in southern Missouri when the accident
occurred Wednesday night, the patrol said.
   Michael P. Schrimpf, 31, of Hendersonville, Tenn., his wife,
Rita, 30, and their sons, Steven, 5, and Jerome, 3, were injured
along with the driver of the pickup, Darold Hawkins, 30, of Alpena,
Ark.
   Twitty and the others on his bus were not hurt.
   The Schrimpfs were listed in serious condition and Hawkins was
in critical condition at a Springfield hospital.
   Twitty, who had performed in Branson on Wednesday night, went to
the hospital to check on the Schrimpfs, then flew to Nashville.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The new military regime today
arrested the former prime minister's nephew in a growing roundup of
members of the deposed government and their relatives, family
friends said.
   The United States has protested the arrests and says at least
two of those reportedly being held have U.S. citizenship. An
independent radio station today said three other U.S. citizens also
were being detained.
   Family friends told The Associated Press that armed men in
civilian clothes early today arrested Alix Celestin, nephew of
former Prime Minister Martial Celestin. The friends said that the
men in plainclothes stole jewelry they found in the house.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported the arrests of three telephone
company officials, apparently because they had cut the lines to the
homes of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and his top officers during last
week's power struggle between the military and the civilian
government.
   Namphy overthrew President Leslie Manigat on Sunday night and
proclaimed himself president the next day. Manigat is in exile in
the Dominican Republic.
   Manigat said he believes at least 20 of his supporters have been
jailed. Some said Wednesday they were going into hiding. One,
75-year-old adviser Pierre Rigaud, was released Wednesday. His
family said he was fatigued and wouldn't comment.
   A spokesman for the regime confirmed Wednesday there had been an
unspecified number of detentions since the army took over Monday.
No reason has been given for the roundup.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite confirmed that Roger Savain
Jr., son of the also-detained former Minister of Information Roger
Savain Sr., and Robert Benodin, a top Manigat adviser, are U.S.
citizens.
   Radio Haiti-Inter today said Benodin's wife, Mireille, and
Manigat party officials Sandy William and Frantz Jean-Louis also
hold U.S. citizenship and were detained.
   The private daily Le Matin reported today the arrests of Eddy
Jeanty, director of the state telephone company TELECO, and of two
members of his staff, Harry Gerard Loiseau and M. Borgart. The
army, the paper said, arrested them for having ordered the lines
cut to the homes of Namphy and his top officers.
   The United States on Wednesday expressed concern.
   ``We find that alarming as one of the first acts of the Namphy
regime,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said in
Washington. ``We have taken that issue up with Haitian officials,
making clear ... that we expect strict respect for internationally
recognized human and civil rights.''
   Also said to be among the arrested Manigat aides was Jean
Lescouflair, an Information Ministry official who worked as a
schoolteacher in Miami. Lite could not say whether Lescouflair is a
U.S. citizen.
   
   He said there had been no direct contact between the embassy and
the new government's leadership.
   Namphy ran the country as head of an interim junta for two years
after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile. He turned over
power in February to Manigat, who was elected the previous month in
military-run elections that were rife with fraud.
   Independently run balloting Nov. 29 was thwarted by attacks on
voters in which more than 30 people were killed.
   Last Friday, Manigat placed Namphy under house arrest and
dismissed him as military chief in a dispute over assignments of
army officers.
   Soldiers freed the general Sunday night, captured the national
palace and sent Manigat to the Dominican Republic, which shares the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Col. Acedius St. Louis, information minister of the new military
government, confirmed Wednesday over independent Radio Antilles
that some prisoners still were being held. He did not say how many,
but said they were being treated well.

   A Justice Department spokesman says a bicycle
messenger wearing a T-shirt that proclaimed ``Meese is a Pig'' was
not admitted to its headquarters because he was ``inappropriately
attired.''
   ``Just as we would not permit somebody to come strolling in here
with a bathing suit, for example, I think it's reasonable to have
some kind of standard,'' spokesman Patrick S. Korten said Wednesday.
   He said the messenger, Christopher Stalvey, ``was
inappropriately attired.''
   Stalvey, who said the incident occurred June 10, visited the
American Civil Liberties Union this week to tell legal director
Arthur B. Spitzer about the encounter.
   ``We are prepared to bring suit if they say this is their
policy,'' Spitzer said. ``It seems like a perfectly clear case of
discrimination based on the content of the T-shirt.''
   Korten, spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese III, said
``this is an interim policy until a firm determination can be made
on how such matters ought to be handled.''
   Korten ``obviously doesn't understand what the First Amendment
is all about,'' said Spitzer. ``If they had a rule that said no
T-shirts, that might be an acceptable rule. But apparently they
have a rule that says no T-shirts that insult Ed Meese. Presumably,
this guy would have been allowed in if he was wearing a T-shirt
that said `Reagan-Bush '84'.''

   A black man riding his bicycle was assaulted
early today by four white men who screamed racial slurs as they
beat him with sticks and fists in the second such racial incident
in two days.
   On Wednesday, a black man was chased by six white men shouting
racial slurs and beaten with a baseball bat in Staten Island.
   The bicyclist, Gregory Frederique, 25, was treated for cuts and
bruises at a hospital. One of his alleged assailants was later
arrested.
   Frederique was riding his bike at 2:30 a.m. in Queens when he
saw a white woman arguing with a white man, said police spokesman
Detective Joseph McConville.
   The white man left, and Frederique approached the woman to offer
his assistance, when four white men began shouting racial slurs at
him and threw a bottle at him from across the street, the detective
said.
   The gang chased him and began beating him with sticks and their
fists. Frederique sought refuge at a gas station where the
attendant called police.
   The victim in Wednesday's incident said the attack reminded him
of the Howard Beach racial assault that left a black dead.
   ``It's the same incident, racial,'' Raymond Buckner said. ``I
was minding my own business. I just get jumped for no reason.''
   After the attack, Buckner found refuge in a pizzeria owned by
two white men who came to his defense and were themselves harassed
and assaulted by the gang.
   ``I feel weird about that,'' said Buckner, adding that the
attack had left him bitter toward whites. ``I get jumped by six
white guys, then helped by two white guys.''
   Three of the whites were arrested shortly after the attack and
three others surrendered Wednesday night.
   Buckner, 24, was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruises to
his right arm and released.
   ``Howard Beach was the first thing I thought of,'' said Jeff
LaMartina, one of the pizzeria owners. ``It wasn't right. This guy
was doing nothing wrong.''
   In that highly publicized case, a dozen white youths attacked a
group of three blacks outside a pizzeria in the Howard Beach
section of Queens in December 1986. One of the black men died when
he was hit by a car while trying to escape. Three white teen-agers
were convicted of manslaughter last December.
   Buckner was walking home from his job as a cook at a Burger King
restaurant in the mostly white Staten Island neighborhood at 12:20
a.m. when he noticed a car carrying white men.
   The car slowed, and the whites began harassing him. ``They were
calling me racial names _ nigger, blackie,'' Buckner said.
   The men left their car and began beating Buckner on the right
arm with sticks and a baseball bat and chasing him, he said.
   Buckner ran into the Cafe DiSicilia.
   ``He was nervous, his arm was messed up, he said he just got
jumped by a carload of white guys,'' LaMartina said.
   The pizzeria owner gave Buckner some ice and offered to drive
him home. Then the six white men appeared in front of the parlor.
   LaMartina said he and a dishwasher went outside to try to
disperse them. The gang initially challenged the two men, but then
walked away.
   LaMartina said he, the dishwasher and the other owner, Sal
Taormina, drove Buckner home.
   Later, the gang returned to the pizza parlor and taunted
LaMartina and Taormina, calling them ``nigger lovers,'' LaMartina
said.
   ``One of them had a bat, and went to swing it at me, but Sal
caught it,'' LaMartina recalled. ``We smacked them around a little
bit, and they ran away.''
   Neighbors who saw the confrontation called police, as did
Buckner when he got home.
   Six youths, ranging in age from 18 to 20, were arrested and
charged with second-degree assault, aggravated harassment and
criminal possession of a deadly instrument. Three also were charged
with criminal possession of marijuana, and one was charged with
driving while intoxicated. All pleaded innocent.

   A vintage U.S. transport plane left Frankfurt for
West Berlin today to mark the 40th anniversary of the Berlin
Airlift, a massive mission to feed and clothe millions of Berliners
sealed off from the rest of the world by Russian troops.
   The C-47 aircraft took off from Frankfurt and landed at
Templehof Airport in West Berlin at 4:14 p.m. at (10:14 a.m. EDT).
   It's a short flight between the two cities, but for the 2
million Berliners blockaded by the Soviets at the end of World War
II, the 250-mile jaunt meant the difference between life and death.
   During the airlift's 15 months, U.S. and British cargo planes
ferried more than 1.8 million tons of food, coal and other vital
supplies to the Allied-controlled sectors of Berlin, an enclave
deep inside what was then Soviet-held territory and is now
Communist East Germany.
   Among the passengers aboard the C-47 flying to West Berlin today
were the U.S., British and French ambassadors to West Germany.
   Earlier, the ambassadors attended the opening of an airlift
exhibit in Bonn and ceremonies at the U.S. Rhine Main Air Base near
Frankfurt.
   Most of the airlift flights originated at Rhine Main.
   Taking part were U.S. Ambassador Richard R. Burt, British
Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby, French Ambassador Serge
Boidevaix, West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz, and West
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen.
   The Berlin Airlift began June 26, 1948 and ended Sept. 30, 1949.
It was masterminded by U.S. Army Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the military
governor of the American zone of conquered Germany following World
War II.
   Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the three other
victorious World War II Allies led to the Soviets move to cut
Berlin off from the West.
   Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was staunchly against creation of
a unified German state in the three Western occupation zones, and
when the Western allies backed a currency reform to speed up
economic recovery of war-torn Germany, Moscow imposed the blockade.
   Just four days after the money reform on June 20, the Soviets
blocked all roads, waterways and railway lines leading to West
Berlin _ 110 miles deep in Soviet-occupied territory.
   In response, Clay ordered all cargo planes available to deliver
provisions to keep the hope for democracy in West Berlin alive.
   The continuous string of small C-47, C-54 and other cargo planes
ferried about 120 tons of supplies to West Berlin daily at the
start.
   By April 1949, the ``Raisin Bombers,'' so-called because the
crews often brought along candy and raisins for Berlin's hungry
children, were bringing in about 13,000 tons of supplies a day.
   After the Soviets called off the blockade on May 12, 1949, the
Western allies continued the flights to the end of September until
normal land, waterway and rail traffic had resumed.
   More than 277,000 flights were conducted during the airlift,
costing $200 million.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet spy ring exposed by Canadian authorities
tried to infiltrate a U.S.-owned military contractor that has
access to highly classified American naval technology, news reports
said.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported late Wednesday that the
ring was after sophisticated warship electronics slated for a new
generation of Canadian naval frigates. It said the sonar, radar and
communications equipment is made by Paramax Electronics of
Montreal, a subsidiary of Unisys Corp. of Detroit.
   The New York Times today quoted unidentified Canadian officials
as saying Paramax had access to classified technology including
equipment that controls weapons systems aboard U.S. Navy ships.
   
   The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which monitored the
activities of the eight Soviet diplomats and officials expelled
last week and nine others barred from re-entering Canada, would not
confirm the link with Paramax.
   But spokesman Jerry Cummings told The Associated Press today:
``It wasn't one single operation _ some of these operations have
been over four or five years.''
   At Paramax offices in Montreal, the company said no one was
available to comment on the incident.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark told Parliament Wednesday that
Canadian authorities had prevented any severe security breach.
   The Soviet government expelled two Canadian diplomats in
retaliation Wednesday and said three others currently out of the
country would not be allowed back.
   
   Spokesman Viatcheslav Bogdanov of the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa
termed the expulsions from Canada ``a provocation.''
   ``These people were not doing anything wrong,'' he said.
   Clark and other government officials declined to provide details
of the Soviets' activities, though Clark said they included
attempts to infiltrate national security intelligence agencies.
   The CBC said one of the Soviets expelled was a naval attache at
the Soviet embassy in Ottawa and was ``caught red-handed in a
sting'' operation.
   It connected his expulsion to the arrest earlier this month of a
Canadian of Hungarian descent, Stephen Ratkai, who was charged with
attempting to obtain classified U.S. military documents from the
Argentia U.S. naval base in Newfoundland. The base monitors Soviet
submarine movements in the Atlantic.
   The CBC also said parts for the new Canadian frigates were once
shipped on a Soviet freighter, and Soviet agents took the
opportunity to examine them.
   Clark announced that a Soviet defector, Yuri Smurov, had
provided ``useful information'' in connection with the expulsions
and has asked to stay in Canada with his family.
   The CBC said Smurov, a translator at the International Civil
Aviation Organization in Montreal, was a Canadian double agent who
``identified most of the Soviet intelligence agents.''
   In December 1987, Paramax was awarded the first part of a $950
million contract to build the combat systems for six new Canadian
frigates. The company, which was established in 1983, had already
been working on the weapons systems and electronics for six other
Canadian frigates.
   At the time, Minister of National Defense Perrin Beatty termed
the order ``the first concrete example of the implementation'' of
Canada's ambitious plans to improve its military.
   The report that the Soviets were seeking information on the
Canadian frigates appears significant because NATO allies have
recently moved to standardize much of their frigate-building
technology.
   Paramax is a subsidiary of Unisys, which was formed in 1986 when
Burroughs Copr. took over Sperry Corp. in a $4.8 billion deal.
   Unisys is a leading defense contractor in the United States. In
June, Datamation magazine ranked it the third biggest computer
company nationwide with revenues in that area of more than $8.5
billion.

   Jesse Jackson said today he has privately
decided whether he would accept the vice presidential nomination
but has not shared that decision with likely Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis.
   ``Privately, yes,'' Jackson said when asked the question by a
reporter after a meeting with his state campaign chairmen from
around the country. However, he reiterated the campaign's public
position that he has earned ```serious consideration'' to be
Dukakis' running mate.
   Before departing on a trip to thank his supporters in Puerto
Rico, Jackson said he's certain that Dukakis at some point will
announce the criteria he is using to pick a running mate.
   Asked to assess whether he's been given fair treatment by the
Democrats in convention preparations, he said, ``I feel positive
about it. I feel hopeful about it.''
   He said the process is ongoing, adding, ``The process is one
thing. The conclusion...is another.''
   The director of Jackson's convention operation, Ron Brown, said
Wednesday the Jackson forces want to see some changes in party
rules, but do not anticipate trying to challenge any rules in
Atlanta next month because their concerns are being met through
``accommodations.''
   Acknowledging some sticking points remain on foreign policy
platform issues, Brown nonetheless expressed optimism a consensus
could be reached with apparent presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Brown steered away from any hint of convention turmoil, saying
negotiations with Dukakis representatives have shown ``a real
willingness and desire'' to iron out differences in the two camps.
   He said the campaign wanted ``to make it known that we are going
with a positive, constructive, unifying attitude, to make it known
that we want the party and the ticket to be stronger when it leaves
Atlanta than when it goes in.''
   Speculation about how much of a fuss Jackson would make at the
convention over rules and platform issues has followed the
committee process leading to this weekend's drafting of the
platform in Denver and the rules committee meeting in Washington.
   Jackson has several suggestions for rules changes he wants the
convention itself to address.
   Asked if he would try to change any rules for purposes of this
summer's convention, Brown indicated that probably would not be the
case as long as Dukakis keeps working on shifting delegates to
Jackson in the states where Jackson considers the process unfair.
   The proposals, he said, ``are prospective in nature,'' adding:
``As far as 1988 we are seeking accommodations. And we feel
positive about the way those discussions are going.''
   Jackson wants to see rules changes that would tie the popular
vote more closely to the candidates' delegate counts in states
where it is not directly proportionate. He also wants to make the
so-called ``super delegates,'' who are free to vote as they like,
more representative of the popular vote in their states.
   Later today, Jackson was leaving for a three-day trip to Puerto
Rico, where he won a non-binding ``beauty contest'' primary. But
voting for delegate slates there awarded all 57 to Dukakis.
   While Jackson may be hoping to persuade some of the delegates to
support him at the national convention, his local backers say he is
mainly interested in underlining the role of Puerto Ricans in his
``Rainbow Coalition.''
   Puerto Rico Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon endorsed Dukakis and
went to New York to campaign for him, angering some Puerto Rican
politicians on the mainland as well as at home.
   Hernandez Colon, who recently met with Puerto Rican political
leaders in New York to patch up any differences, planned to meet
with Jackson.
   The island's 3.2 million people are U.S. citizens but do not
vote in general elections.

   A Navy judge today refused to
rule out the death penalty as a possible sentence in the
court-martial of a sailor accused of killing a disbursement officer
in a robbery.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon is charged with murder,
robbery, kidnapping and receiving stolen property in the March 15
shooting death of Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad and the theft of the
$94,629 payroll from the destroyer USS Hancock.
   His court-martial is scheduled to begin July 5.
   Defense counsel Lt. Matthew J. Michels asked the judge, Cmdr.
John A. Studer, in motions Monday to rule out capital punishment if
Colon is convicted.
   But Studer said today that capital punishment could be an
appropriate penalty in the case.
   The Navy has not executed anyone since 1849, according to Nick
Young, a Navy spokesman.
   The judge today also denied motions to dismiss some of the
charges against Colon.
   Defense lawyers also are seeking to suppress statements gathered
by investigators and other evidence.
   Most of the cash taken in the robbery was found in a

<HEAD>Scientists Say Figures Confirm Two Tons of Plutonium Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists campaigning against nuclear weapons say
new calculations confirm that about 2.3 tons of plutonium produced
in British civil nuclear reactors is missing.
   But authorities say the scientists have misunderstood the
problem and gotten their figures wrong.
   In a letter published today in Nature, a science weekly, an
American and three British scientists say their 1985 claim of a
shortfall is borne out by more detailed figures which the
government began publishing last year.
   They say they don't know where the missing plutonium has gone,
but speculate that it went to nuclear weapons programs in Britain
or the United States or both.
   The letter to Nature is signed by physicists Keith Barnham of
the Imperial College, London; David Hart of the pressure group
Scientists Against Nuclear Arms; Jenny Nelson of Bristol
University; and Rob Stevens of Unicam Corp., Aptox, Calif.
   The problem centers on a 6.8-ton gap between government civil
stockpiles, and the amount the scientists calculate actually were
produced.
   The scientists said they have calculated that four tons went to
the United States in exchange for enriched uranium under an
agreement that lasted until 1971.
   About half a ton was lost in reprocessing, leaving 2.3 tons
unaccounted for, they wrote.
   They said their 1985 calculations could not be confirmed because
the government then was not disclosing figures.
   But when the government began publishing figures for each of its
nine reactors, these coincided with the physicists' earlier
calculations, proving their original model was correct, they wrote.
   Even so, the government figures are rounded out to the nearest
110 pounds of plutonium per reactor, which taken together would be
enough to arm 100 warheads a year, Barnham said in an interview.
   Diane Monk, a spokeswoman for the government's Central
Electricity Generating Board, said: ``The scientists' figures are
inaccurate, because large numbers are involved and because they
would appear to lack basic understanding of the processes
involved.''

   A nationwide survey of 1,400 hospital executives
shows that 48 percent of them think reduced Medicare reimbursements
may force their hospitals to close in the next five years.
   Small, rural and government-owned hospitals in Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas are most vulnerable, according to the
survey conducted and paid for by the Boston-based Touche Ross
accounting and management consulting firm.
   Suburban hospitals and hospitals owned by religious
organizations also may be much more likely to close than in
previous years, the survey showed.
   Hospitals in New England showed the greatest increase in the
likelihood of closure, according to the study titled ``U.S.
Hospitals: The Future of Health Care.''
   In 1986, hospital executives estimated that 21 percent of their
facilities might close. In the recent survey, the chance for
closure jumped to 46 percent of local hospitals.
   ``The fact that so many hospitals anticipated failure is even
more dramatic when one realizes that 150 hospitals have already
closed in the last two years,'' said Raymond Cisneros, national
director of health services for Touche Ross.
   If the survey predictions are accurate, 680 hospitals will close
in the next five years, he said.
   Cisneros said the main reason for what the survey called
American hospitals' ``increased vulnerability to failure'' is the
decrease in revenues under the Medicare Prospective Payment system,
a program created in 1983 to standardize the amounts Medicare
reimburses hospitals for in-patient care.
   Almost 70 percent of the hospital executives surveyed said
hospital incomes have dropped since the program's inception.
   In contrast to small, rural and suburban hospitals, inner-city
hospitals and other urban hospitals show no indication of a greater
potential for closure since a 1986 survey, Cisneros said. Hospitals
with the least chance of closure are located in the mid-Atlantic
states and on the West Coast.
   Other findings of the survey:
   _Occupancy rates are at an all-time low. Forty-six percent of
the hospitals surveyed reported average occupancy of less than 50
percent.
   _The quality of care was perceived as declining. In 1986, 55
percent of hospitals ranked the health care available in their
regions as excellent, but in 1988 that number dropped to 44 percent.
   _There are signs of increasing limitations on health-care
delivery. Three-fourths of the hospital officials questioned
believe health care given patients should be curtailed when the
cost of providing that care becomes excessive.
   Questionnaires were sent to hospital executives at all 5,678
acute-care hospitals in the country.

   Huge landslides roared through eastern
Turkey today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a
coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide,
authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried.
   Rescue teams recovered three bodies under the wreckage, the
Anatolia News agency reported.
   The dispatch said at least 18 people were injured in the
disaster in a mountainous area of Macka township, about 350 miles
northeast of Ankara and not far from the Black Sea.
   ``I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,''
the news agency quoted a witness, Zeki Ilhan, as saying.
   Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a
restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports.
   The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed
with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after
the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight,
the reports added.
   Deputy Gov. Erkan Isilgan of Trabzon province told The
Associated Press by telephone that rescue teams feared the death
toll would climb since so many people were missing.
   Isilgan said rescuers were trying to find out whether the
passengers included any foreign tourists.
   Rain hampered rescue operations. Anatolia quoted an official
supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as
two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued.
   Public Works Minister Safa Giray, who flew to the site, told
Anatolia that rescue teams might recover some people alive. ``That
is what we hope,'' he said.
   The state radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to
search for victims because of threats of more landslides.
   The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to
drive away the mud and stone which covered the site.
   Anatolia said the landslides struck along a stretch of road
where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight,
when an earlier landslide blocked the highway.
   The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after
the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess.
   Provincial Gov. Enver Hizlan was quoted as saying the army would
be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior,
public works and energy ministers, flew to Trabzon from Ankara.
   Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed
on extensive deforestation.

<TEXT>
   A judge today granted a mistrial in a
lawsuit pitting actor Paul Newman against a delicatessen owner
after jurors said they could not deliberate impartially after
getting a look at unauthorized evidence.
   Superior Court Judge Howard Zoarski declared the mistrial after
jurors sent a note out of the jury room that they couldn't ignore
depositions that were never entered into evidence but were
inadvertently turned over to them before deliberations began two
days ago.
   The judge's ruling reversed one he made earlier in the day when
he instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from
Westport deli owner Julius Gold and others involved in the case.
   Gold had alleged during the three-week, breach-of-contract trial
that an attorney for Newman promised him 8 percent of the stock
from Newman's food company in return for helping Newman's Own Inc.
   The jury, which had deliberated for eight hours over two days,
was sent home Wednesday after its foreman told the court that it
had received depositions from Gold and some defendants and wanted
to see Newman's.
   W. Patrick Ryan, Newman's attorney, said Wednesday it appeared
the clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room inadvertently
also took the depositions.
   Author A.E. Hotchner, Newman's longtime friend who is also being
sued, said, ``Alice in Wonderland falling down the rabbit hole had
a more sane time of it than I did falling in this judicial hole.''
   Gold filed suit against Newman, another Westport resident; his
two food companies, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad King Inc.;
Hotchner, and Kalman.
   Gold claimed that he helped develop and market Newman's Own
salad dressing and was promised the stock. Gold said he contributed
30 months effort to Newman's company and believed that his work led
to its success.
   The defendants have denied all of the allegations.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982.
   Newman said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four
people who contributed to the food venture but Gold was not among
them. He also said he decided not to give away any stock after his
lawyer advised him against it.

<TEXT>
   A death row inmate who faced execution
Saturday won a 30-day stay on the same day that the Supreme Court
upheld the state's death penalty law.
   Convicted killer Fletcher Mann got the stay Wednesday from a
federal judge in Dallas because new attorneys in his case asked for
more time.
   Also Wednesday, the high court announced its long-anticipated
decision that it had voted 6-3 to uphold the conviction and death
sentence of Donald Gene Franklin of San Antonio.
   Attorneys for Franklin had contended jurors were not allowed to
consider any mitigating circumstances in sentencing Franklin for
the 1975 abduction-slaying of nurse Peggy Moran.
   Since the high court agreed to hear the case late last year,
only one inmate, Robert Streetman, was put to death. Dozens of
prisoners used the pending case to obtain stays of execution.
   After hearing of the high court decision Wednesday, death row
inmates were predictably glum.
   Mann, 27, who had not yet heard of his stay was philosophical.
``If it's going to happen, it's going to happen,'' he said of the
possibility of his death.
   Many inmates believed the Franklin case, the most serious
challenge to the Texas death penalty law in several years, would
result in a ruling favorable to them and commutations of their
sentences to life.
   ``I feel like an idiot having put my hopes in the court,''
inmate Jim Vanderbilt said. ``This is a bitter disappointment. It's
not easy seeing your friends hauled off to be killed.''
   ``I'm afraid they'll try to get as many as they can before the
next issue comes up,'' said James Beathard, another death row
resident.
   Franklin has turned down interviews since the ruling.
   His attorney, Mark Stevens, said he likely would seek a
rehearing for Franklin but that the high court rarely granted such
motions.
   Stevens said he doubted the pace of executions would quicken and
speculated the court would analyze capital cases on a case-by-case
basis.
   ``It's pretty nice when the Supreme Court of the United States
says you're right,'' said Bob Walt, an assistant attorney general
who handles death row cases. ``The plurality opinion is very close
to what we said in our brief.''
   Walt said it is likely Franklin would be rescheduled for
execution and the Supreme Court would vacate stays issued to other
Texas inmates who cited the Franklin case.
   Texas, which uses lethal injections, has executed 27 convicted
killers, more than any other state since the Supreme Court allowed
the death penalty to resume in 1976.

   Burglars broke into offices in the
presidential palace compound three days in a row during President
Corazon Aquino's visit to Europe, it was reported Thursday.
   One of the offices cited by The Manila Chronicle denied it was
burglarized, another refused to comment but a third confirmed
thieves broke in last week and stole staplers, calculators, pens
and paper.
   Franco Badelles, head of a presidential commission processing
death claims from a ship that sank last year, said employees told
him other offices also were burglarized.
   The Chronicle identified the other offices in the compound's
administrative building as the presidential commissions on urban
poor and youth affairs.
   Security officials declined to comment on the reported June
13-15 burglaries.
   Mrs. Aquino visited Switzerland and Italy on June 13-18.

said.
   Police said they found 55 pounds of cocaine in the car, another
68 pounds near the Japanese ship and 46 more pounds aboard the ship.

   Anatoly N. Rybakov, author of ``Children of the
Arbat,'' is in the front rank of those struggling to reform the
Soviet system, a system which sent him to Siberia in the 1930s and
blocked publication of his novel for 21 years. His book, finally
published in Russian last year, has recently appeared in English
and his been critically acclaimed.

<TEXT>
   Anatoly Naumovich Rybakov, still
energetic at 77, jumped up and pulled a bundle of papers from one
of the shelves that line the study of his cottage in the forested
writers' colony outside Moscow.
   Carefully, lovingly, the novelist laid the bundle on the desk
next to the window, untied the string and pulled out two covers of
the largest Soviet literary magazine, Novy Mir, one from 1966 and
the other from 1978.
   In the soft light, filtered through the trees, Rybakov held up
first one and then the other of the blue sheets of stiff paper,
tracing with his gnarled finger the underlined announcement that
the journal would soon publish ``Children of the Arbat,'' his novel
of the Great Terror waged by dictator Josef V. Stalin in the 1930s.
   Both times, in 1966 and 1978, publication was blocked by the men
in the Kremlin, men who rose to power under Stalin.
   Rybakov's patience paid off.
   More than 21 years after it was written, ``Children of the
Arbat'' was published last year in the literary journal Druzhba
Narodov (Friendship of Peoples), as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign to reform the tyrannical system created by Stalin.
   The novel has since appeared in hardback editions, and was
published in English in the United States last month by Little,
Brown & Co.
   The book probes more deeply than any other yet published in the
Soviet Union into Stalin's mind and methods, the pettiness and
arbitrariness that guided his followers, the innocence of his
victims and the terror he created.
   It tells the story of Sasha Pankratov, a young man of 23 who,
like Rybakov, was sentenced without trial for a crime he never
committed and sent to Siberia for three years of cold and lonely
exile.
   Rybakov grew up in the apartment building inhabited by most of
the book's characters, No. 51 Arbat Street, an old shopping street
in downtown Moscow that was at once popular among the Communist
Party elite and among fashionable young people.
   Rybakov is working on the sequel, ``1935 and Other Years,''
which will continue the story, and like ``Children of the Arbat,''
will give intimate portraits of Stalin and his lieutenants and
describe how he terrorized his deputies and the country.
   ``The entire nation lived in fear,'' said Rybakov, his craggy
features grim beneath a balding pate and gray hair. ``Only one
person thought for himself. Everyone else abandoned free thought.''
   Gorbachev and his supporters have concluded that a nation based
on such a system cannot survive in the technological age.
   During the years Rybakov waited for his blockbuster to appear in
print, he lived and worked at his peaceful dacha, or cottage, at
Peredelkino, the wooded village where the Nobel Prize-winning poet
and novelist Boris Pasternak wrote and is buried. Rybakov earned a
comfortable living by writing 11 other novels, as well as
screenplays for television and movies.
   He resisted the temptation to publish his works abroad, as
Pasternak, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and others had done. Pasternak
was ostracized, his works banned until recently, and Solzhenitsyn
was exiled to the West.
   ``I wanted to publish it in this country,'' said Rybakov. ``I
wanted to change my country. That is why I have been so patient.''
   Hardback and paperbound editions of the book are expected to
reach 3.5 million copies, he said, a phenomenal circulation in the
Soviet Union , where a run of 100,000 is considered generous for
works of fiction.
   The book disappears from stores before it reaches the shelves.
The only places it can be found in Moscow are in hotel shops open
only to foreigners and at a special store on Kropotkin Street that
accepts no rubles, only Western currency. On the black market, it
sells for 30 rubles ($51.40), more than 10 times its retail price.
   Inside the Kropotkin store, a saleswoman told an American
visitor, ``I'm sorry. We don't have `Children of the Arbat.' It
hasn't come in yet.''
   Then she lowered her voice. ``I'll get you a copy. But just
one.'' She disappeared, returning a few minutes later with the
volume.
   The written word has played a huge role in Russia since the 19th
century, when works by writers such as Pushkin and Tolstoy were a
moral and spiritual counterbalance to the authoritarian rule of the
Czars. The influence of writers in the Soviet Union is immensely
greater than that of any American author in the United States.
   ``I don't think that fiction is as important in the United
States in shaping the image of a country in the minds of the
people,'' said Rybakov, just back from a month-long trip to
America, his third visit in as many years.
   In reforming the Soviet system, said Rybakov, ``the first step
is to change the psychology of the people. Perestroika
(restructuring) started in literature, films, the mass media, the
fields that shape people's spiritual lives and thinking.''
   ``We need to reshape people's minds, and that will inevitably
lead us to economic freedom,'' said Rybakov.
   ``Children of the Arbat'' deals largely with the purges within
the Communist Party, and only mentions in passing a far bloodier
episode _ the 1929-32 collectivization of agriculture _ which
caused a famine and, according to estimates by Western scholars,
claimed 8 million lives.
   Rybakov said he will explore this in greater depth in his next
novel.
   ``My figures are even higher,'' he said.
   Although food shortages persist, six decades later Soviet
authors have only tentatively touched on the collectivization
issue. Any detailed discussion might lead to calls to return the
land to private farmers, a step reformers in China have taken.
   Rybakov lets a grin crease his leathery face: ``I am no expert
on decollectivization, but we need greater freedom in the village.''
   The smile gives way again to a look of grim determination. ``Who
will take land and cultivate it if he fears that someone will take
it away from him?''

   Dr. William C. DeVries, who performed the
nation's first permanent artificial heart implant nearly six years
ago, has resigned from Humana Heart Institute International, it was
announced today.
   His resignation is effective Monday, according to a news release
from Humana Hospital-Audubon, where the institute is based.
   DeVries had been the institute's physician consultant in
cardiovascular surgery.
   DeVries indicated that with his decision last year to establish
his own private practice, continuation as a member of the institute
could create a competitive conflict with Dr. Allan M. Lansing's
private practice, the release said.
   In 1984, DeVries left the University of Utah to join Lansing's
practice. Lansing also founded the institute and serves as its
director and chairman.
   DeVries performed the nation's first heart transplant in Salt
Lake City on retired dentist Barney Clark of Seattle, who received
a Jarvik-7 artificial heart on Dec. 12, 1982. Clark died 112 days
later.
   William J. Schroeder, a retired federal worker from Jasper,
Ind., lived longest of anyone with the permanent implant, 620 days,
after receiving a Jarvik-7 on Nov. 25, 1984.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today his administration had been
entirely open about a prison controversy under investigation by the
FBI. Jesse Jackson said he has decided whether he wants to be
Dukakis' running mate but would not divulge his decision unless
offered the job.
   Dukakis toured a day care facility at a private business as the
prison probe erupted. The FBI, noting Dukakis' status as the
certain Democratic presidential nominee, took the unusual step of
saying the governor himself was ``not the subject of an
investigation.''
   The FBI said it is looking into a Dukakis administration
multi-million dollar proposal to purchase land for a prison in New
Braintree in central Massachusetts, a plan vigorously opposed by
the community.
   ``The process was as open as it could possibly be... We have
very tough procedures for the acquisition of property,'' Dukakis
told reporters today.
   Jackson, meanwhile, was besieged with questions about the vice
presidential nomination. Had he decided in his own mind whether he
would accept if offered? ``Privately, yes,'' Jackson said. But then
he cut off reporters.
   Republican George Bush had a series of private meetings
scheduled today: breakfast with former U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick, an afternoon session with President Reagan and
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, and evening meetings with
Australian prime minister Bob Hawke.
   Kirkpatrick has been mentioned as a longshot vice presidential
prospect on a Bush ticket. Some observers believe a woman on the
ticket might boost Bush's support among female voters. A number of
polls have suggested that women are far more likely to back
Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, than Bush, his
likely opponent. But the vice president dismissed such surveys.
   ``What you do is spell out your positions on the issues and the
gender gap goes away and you win the election,'' Bush told local
reporters Wednesday on a trip to Louisville, Ky.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis told reporters in Boston that the process
of picking a running mate had ``just begun.''
   However, campaign sources indicated the pace was picking up, as
several vice presidential prospects _ including Florida Sen. Bob
Graham, Ohio Sen. John Glenn and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn _ were
invited to submit background and financial information to the
Dukakis campaign for scrutiny.
   One lawmaker, however, said he wants to be crossed off the list
of contenders. New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said through a
spokesman that he had told the Dukakis campaign he wasn't
interested.
   ``He's absolutely unambiguous about this,'' said Bradley
spokesman Nick Donatiello.
   Pressed about Jackson, Dukakis replied that the second-place
finisher in the primary races was under ``very serious
consideration.''
   However, Dukakis said ``it helps'' for a vice presidential
contender to have held public office. Jackson never has.
   The two met Tuesday in California, after weeks of signals from
Jackson that he should be offered a spot on the ticket. Jackson
said the two talked about the selection of a running mate, but
refused to elaborate.
   Ron Brown, the head of Jackson's convention team, said Jackson
did not directly ask for a place on the ticket.
   Dukakis, who has enough delegates for a first-ballot victory at
next month's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, betrayed a
flash of impatience when asked about Jackson's refusal to concede
the nomination.
   ``It's over,'' the nominee-to-be said shortly.
   Dukakis on Wednesday won the backing of Biden, who dropped out
of the race last September amid allegations of plagiarism and
exaggerating his academic record.
   One of the most damaging stories to surface at that time was
Biden's liberal borrowing, without credit, from a speech by British
politician Neil Kinnock.
   After Biden bowed out, Dukakis' top aide John Sasso admitted
that he distributed the ``attack video'' featuring the Biden and
Kinnock speeches that triggered the stories.
   The Dukakis campaign had initially denied any role in the
incident. And when Sasso told Dukakis what he had done, the
candidate wavered before finally accepting his aide's resignation.
   However, Biden said later he blamed only himself.
   The Delaware senator's expression of support for Dukakis, nine
months after the collapse of his candidacy, came in a telephone
call from Biden's home, his office in Washington said. Biden is
recuperating from surgery last month to repair an aneurysm near his
brain.
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan welcomed the endorsement, praising
Biden as a ``leader and a fighter'' who can be a ``tremendous
help'' to the campaign.
   Two of the Massachusetts governor's other former rivals for the
Democratic nomination _ Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri _ were to be on hand for a pricey
Democratic fund-raiser in Washington tonight.
   In other developments:
   _Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said reports that his city will not
be ready in time for the Democratic National Convention are
exaggerated. ``Anybody who doesn't like Atlanta can go somewhere
else,'' said the mayor.
   _Dissident Republicans in Michigan have taken the first step
toward challenging the credentials of Michigan's 77 delegates to
the GOP National Convention. After a dispute over party rules, the
dissidents had walked out of the state GOP convention and held
their own gathering. Now, they have sent the national party their
competing list of delegates to the convention.

<TEXT>
   Three unmanned locomotives today sped
through three towns at speeds up to 40 mph before stopping on their
own, officials said.
   The runaway engines traveled about 10 miles between the towns of
Orange and Gardner in north central Massachusetts.
   There were no injuries reported as a result of the runaway
engines, said Colin Pease, spokesman for Guilford Transportation
Industries, which operates the trains.
   Pease said a crew working on engines near the Gardner rail yard
discovered the string of locomotives was gone at about 5 a.m. and
they notified a dispatcher, who alerted local authorities.
   He said he believes the trains were released by vandals, and he
said it was at least the second runaway since another string of
locomotives sped out of control through nine towns last November
until they were deliberately slammed into empty freight cars in
Deerfield.
   There were no injuries in that incident, and the FBI said it has
found no evidence of sabotage.
   Pease, however, said the two runaways and a third last January
form a pattern that cannot be coincidental.
   ``The circumstances are just too close,'' Pease said.
``Hopefully somebody will begin realizing this is a serious problem
and that we need help.''
   The latest incident came four days after striking rail workers
began returning to work, ending a six-month walkout over safety
issues.
   Union leader Mike Maloof said today that the workers could not
have been involved in the alleged vandalism because they were busy
taking physical exams.

   Three more indictments have been handed up in an
investigation into the theft of civil service tests for
metropolitan area police officers.
   Nine officers or former officers already have been convicted in
the scandal that began in 1986 when a Metropolitan District
Commission police captain pleaded guilty to being the mastermind of
the theft and distribution operation.
   The latest indictments include the first woman promoted to
police lieutenant in Newton.
   Officials say the careers of more than 100 officers may have
been stalled as they continue investigation of the scam.
   The three officers surrendered Wednesday and were released on
unsecured bonds.
   Indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury, according to U.S.
Attorney Frank McNamara, were former Newton Lt. Marilyn T. Connell,
Revere Patrolman Robert E. Nunez and Metropolitan Police Lt.
Richard A. Nazzaro.
   Ms. Connell and Nazzaro pleaded innocent when arraigned in U.S.
District Court. Nunez will be arraigned Monday.
   They face varying charges in connection with purchase or
possession of advance copies of the tests. They face maximum
penalties on each charge of five years in prison and $250,000 in
fines.
   Former Metropolitan Police Capt. Gerald W. Clemente pleaded
guilty in 1986 to racketeering in connection with the theft and
distribution of civil service entrance and promotional exams.
   He is serving a sentence of 30 to 40 years in state prison for a
Medford bank robbery and faces an additional 15 years in prison in
the civil service examinations case.

<TEXT>
   Rear-seat lap belts expose victims of car
crashes to greater risk of paralysis or death than lap-and-shoulder
restraints, according to a study released Thursday by
product-liability lawyers.
   The Institute for Injury Reduction, a Dunkirk, Md., organization
founded this year by attorneys involved in product-injury
litigation, presented the study at a hearing of the House
government activities and transportation subcommittee.
   ``In crash after crash, children and adults are dying, being
rendered paraplegic or quadriplegic or suffering disabling injuries
to their abdominal organs while wearing only rear-seat lap belts,''
A. Benjamin Kelley, president of the institute, testified.
   The tests commissioned by the institute were conducted by
Automotive Safety Testing Inc. of East Liberty, Ohio.
   The tests used instrumented dummies belted into the rear-seat
assembly of a 1987 Honda Accord LX and subjected to simulated
crashes.
   A 33 mph simulated crash using dummies the size of 6-year-old
children showed pressure against the outer part of the lap belt
when used alone was 61 percent greater than with a lap-shoulder
combination.
   In a simulated crash at 27 mph using adult-size dummies,
pressure on the outside part of the lap belt when used alone was
338 percent higher than with a lap-shoulder combination. A similar
test at 32 mph showed a 145 percent difference.
   The results indicate ``a greater likelihood for lap-belt only
occupants to sustain severe ... or fatal injuries in such
crashes,'' the study said.
   Peter Sursi, program manager at Automotive Safety Testing, said
in an interview the study did not address the question of the
position of the lap belt on the passenger.
   Auto manufacturers and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration have said a properly adjusted lap belt will provide
protection because the force of the crash will be absorbed by the
large pelvic bones.
   A misadjusted belt will result in the belt's cutting through the
soft abdomen to the spinal column, studies have shown.
   NHTSA's policy is to encourage manufacturers voluntarily to
install lap-and-shoulder belt combinations in the rear seat while
asserting that a lap belt alone provides better crash protection
than no belt.
   A 1986 study by the National Transportation Safety Board,
however, concluded that lap belts used alone may cause serious
injury rather than providing protection.
   Thomas Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, which represents the nation's automakers, told the
committee ``by 1990 virtually every car produced in the U.S. will
be equipped with lap-shoulder belts in outboard rear seating
positions.''
   Automakers offer kits for nearly all models made in the last 10
years that allow owners to install lap-should belt combinations in
the back seat of vehicles, Hanna said.
   The Institute for Injury Reduction, however, said knowledge and
availability of such kits is limited.
   The institute, on May 25-26, conducted a random telephone poll
of 30 dealers for five automakers in six cities and found none had
lap-should belt kits in stock, 21 said no kits were available and
only eight said kits could be ordered.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today urged Austrians
to remember its World War II past as he began a controversial trip
that includes meetings with President Kurt Waldheim and a visit to
a former Nazi death camp.
   Waldheim, under bitter attack from Jews and shunned by most
Western leaders for his alleged complicity in Nazi war crimes, led
the official government welcoming delegation for the Roman Catholic
leader.
   Waldheim, in his own greetings, denounced ``intolerance,
intransigence and hate among nations, religions and classes,'' but
made no direct comments about the dispute over his past as a German
army officer.
   The white-robed pontiff's special Alitalia DC-9 aircraft touched
down at Vienna' Schwechat Airport during a light shower.
   In comments delievered in German, John Paul mentioned his second
trip as pope to Austria will include the site of the former
Mauthausen death camp.
   He said such places recall ``times of hardship which have left
their indelible mark.
   ``Let us, when we meet, bring before God not only the great and
burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the
present,'' the pontiff said.
   Many Austrians claim they were victims of Adolf Hitler's Nazi
rule, and the nation's events marking the 50th anniversary of the
1938 annexation with the Third Reich have sparked a renewed round
of soul-searching.
   The Polish-born pontiff drew the ire of Jews when he received
Waldheim a year ago at the Vatican, an audience the pope later
defended as ``necessary'' because Waldheim came as a democratically
elected president. The Vatican says the pope's meetings with world
leaders do not imply his support for an individual or political
system.
   ``This is not a political visit. It is a pastoral visit. He (the
pope) was invited by the bishops,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro.
   Today, six American Jews demonstrated outside Waldheim's office
to show their displeasure with the pope's decision to meet with him.
   ``Do not embrace Waldheim, no!'' said Rabbi Avi Weiss of the
Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, N.Y. Standing with him were five
Jewish students dressed in black-and-white striped uniforms
reminiscent of those worn by concentration camp inmates during the
Nazi era.
   Earlier this week, two representatives of major Jewish
organizations met with a Vatican envoy in Jerusalem to register
their protests over the meetings.
   Dr. Avi Beker of the World Jewish Congress said the pope was
``going out of his way to legitimize Waldheim.''
   But Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, director of international relations
of the American Jewish Committee, warned against ``extremist
hysteria and stridency'' over the meetings.
   In a statement from New York on Wednesday, he pointed out that
the pope was visiting a predominantly Catholic country and that it
was Vatican policy for popes to meet with heads of states of
countries with which the Holy See has diplomatic relations.
   Tanenbaum also said his group had been informed by Vatican
officials that the pope's contacts with Waldheim ``will be kept to
an absolute minimum.''
   Waldheim has denied that he committed war crimes, but the United
States has barred him, saying it found evidence he was involved in
deportations of Balkan civilians in World War II.
   An international commission of historians appointed by the
Austrian government to investigate the allegations concluded in
February that Waldheim was aware of Nazi atrocities in the Balkans
and did nothing to prevent them. It left open the question of
whether he was guilty of wartime atrocities.
   John Paul is to deliver about 20 speeches during the trip, his
second to a country where the Vatican counts 6.4 million Roman
Catholics, or 85 percent of the 7.5 million population. He paid a
three-day visit in 1983.
   On Friday, the 68-year-old pontiff is scheduled to meet with
representatives of Austria's 12,000 Jews, then visit the site of
the Mauthausen concentration camp where 110,000 prisoners died
during World War II. On pilgrimages to his homeland, the pope
visited the Auschwitz and Majdanek death camps.

   The famed leaning tower tilted another
fraction of an inch in the past year, a rate that might cause the
landmark to topple in about 100 years, an expert said Thursday.
   Gero Geri of the University of Pisa said that since June 1987
the tower has leaned 0.05 inches, according to measurments taken
Wednesday.
   Geri is a member of the team which makes semi-annual checks of
the displacement of several of Pisa's architectural treasures,
settling into the city's soft clay foundation.
   Although December's check-up showed encouraging signs that the
tower's tilt may be slowing, Geri said Wednesday's readings
indicated the monument had resumed its average tilting pace of
about 0.04 inches per year.
   The 180-foot tower, completed between 1360 and 1370, is now
leaning 14.6 feet off the vertical.
   ``We really do not know why it's still standing,'' Geri said.
``But judging from its current rate of shift and from the centuries
the process has taken, we estimate that the structure will fall in
a century if nothing is done to stop it.''
   He added: ``No one is really sure when it will go down.''
   The Ministry of Public Works has been trying for years to come
up with a plan to save the tower, but any project is far from
implementation.

<HEAD>Pentagon Investigation May Be Catnip for Both Democrats and
Republicans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burgeoning Pentagon bribery investigation
may be developing into the kind of scandal both Democrats and
Republicans can love.
   Little more than a week after it emerged into public view, the
contract-fraud affair shows potential to become the most
politically popular scandal in years, says one defense lawyer for a
man targeted by the investigators.
   ``This is the best thing that's happened to both the Republicans
and Democrats in six months, because for the Republicans it gets
everybody's mind off (Attorney General) Ed Meese and for the
Democrats it gets everybody's mind off (House Speaker) Jim
Wright,'' said this lawyer, who has no desire for any more
publicity for his or his client's name.
   ``So what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both
parties to try to pump it up. You've got a Republican, (Iowa Sen.
Charles) Grassley, who's pumping it up, and you've got the
Democrats too'' including Sens. David Pryor of Arkansas and Sam
Nunn of Georgia, and Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the lawyer added.
All four have joined the public outcry over the affair.
   ``It's the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets
reporters off their leadership,'' the lawyer said. ``It's terrific,
a perfect opportunity.''
   This experienced attorney is one of a dozen Washington lawyers
already hired by the contractors, consultants and Pentagon
officials named in government search warrants or grand jury
subpoenas.
   He was giving his admittedly self-interested view of how
government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable
publicity for their side of the case through leaks, speeches and
news conferences even before the investigators have brought any
charges or made any arrests.
   Meese, who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to
discuss ongoing investigations in public, even held a news
conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut
Grassley's complaints that the Justice Department had moved too
slowly.
   Since the government's coordinated searches on June 14, the
Pentagon story has muscled two high-profile investigations off the
nation's front pages: the special prosecutor's imminent report on
whether Meese used his office to benefit himself and friends, and a
House ethics investigation of Democratic Speaker Jim Wright's
finances and official actions.
   The well-known names Meese and Wright have been replaced by
those of Pentagon bureaucrats, private consultants and contractors
who are hardly household words _ Berlin, Galvin, Gunn, Lackner,
Paisley, Parkin and others.
   Even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by Justice
Department or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to
investigators are not the best known on Capitol Hill _ Democrats
William Chappell Jr. of Florida; Roy Dyson of Maryland; Thomas J.
Downey and Samuel S. Stratton, both of New York; and Republican
Andy Ireland of Florida.
   Aides to those five point out that even the leakers don't say
they're under investigation at this time. Federal prosecutor Henry
Hudson publicly says no one on the Hill is now a target.
   This is as close as a Washington scandal comes to catnip for
politicians. As Texas GOP chairman George Strake told the Dallas
Times Herald, ``Every morning when I wake up, I run out to get the
paper and see what the scandal of the day is, whether it's on them
or us.''
   The defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those
tempted to translate leaks and FBI search warrant affidavits into
automatic convictions.
   ``It's a specific federal crime if you trade inside information
on Wall Street, but there is a sensitive information flow between
the Pentagon and its contractors that is not only legal but even
encouraged. Only in certain circumstances is that illegal,'' he
said.
   The leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as
government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and
office conversations. But this lawyer, who has heard similar
government tapes before, said, ``They may not have tapes that are
that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal
depending on the intent involved.''
   ``The tapes may have showed a need to check further,'' the
lawyer said. But he emphasized that further investigation is just
beginning with last week's massive seizure of records and the
efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate.
   Even if the leakers are correct, he said, ``this would be dozens
of separate, small conspiracies that take time to investigate _ not
one, big conspiracy.'' All the search warrants were done together
so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved
in separate, similar schemes to begin shredding their documents.
   Based on his experience, this lawyer said, ``The people
hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least. The
ones who know the most don't talk at this stage.''

<HEAD>Exhibits Changed At Stalin Museum, Georgian Official Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Rybakov, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent criticism of the crimes of Josef V. Stalin
have prompted unspecified changes at the museum honoring him in his
Georgian birthplace, the Communist Party leader of the southern
republic said Thursday.
   The Stalin museum in his native town of Gori _ which also has
the last town square statue of the dictator left standing in the
Soviet Union _ contained a large and uncritical display of
artifacts tracing Stalin's life and political career.
   Georgian party head Dzhumber Patiashvili was asked at a news
conference Thursday whether the museum showed the Georgian party
had a different attitude to Stalin than Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
in November condemned the dictator's ``enormous and unforgiveable
crimes.''
   ``There can be no other interpretations,'' said Patiashvili.
   He added that although Stalin ``is not a Georgian problem at
all,'' but a Soviet one, the museum at Gori had been reviewed since
November and ``the exhibits there have been changed in the spirit
of Gorbachev's report.'' He did not detail the changes.
   There have been unconfirmed reports the museum would close prior
to being turned into a museum of Stalin's ``cult of personality,''
which is fiercely criticized in Soviet media.
   Almost all monuments extolling Stalin were dismantled after
Nikita S. Khrushchev condemned the former leader in 1956.
   In Georgia, however, some residents still proudly display
pictures of Stalin at home or in car windows. In the capital of
Tbilisi, a river embankment, park and mountain railway are named
for Stalin.
   Even after Khrushchev's condemnation, Stalin continued to be
extolled as a hero of the Soviet Union's World War II victory over
Germany.
   In Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad, quotes from Stalin are
engraved on World War II memorials.
   This week, however, articles coinciding with the anniversary of
the June 22, 1941, invasion by the Nazis have openly criticized
Stalin for failing to heed Red Army warnings of a coming German
invasion, suggesting he left the nation unprepared for attack.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Expanding federal crop insurance and diverting
Lake Michigan to allow resumption of Mississippi River barge
traffic are among the steps needed to deal with the drought,
speakers today told Midwestern governors.
   ``We'll need a little bit of time to determine what the losses
are,'' said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng. ``But we will
do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.''
   The 10 governors at the meeting told Lyng about a number of
problems.
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson said his state's soybean and corn
crops would be lost without substantial rain in the next 30 days,
while Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota said 70 percent of his
state's grain crop already is lost.
   ``Welcome to the heart of the drought land,'' Thompson said in
opening the conference. ``We used to be known as the heart of the
heartland. Now we are both.''
   Thompson said barge traffic _ much of it bringing crops to
market _ is virtually closed on the vital commercial waterway of
the Mississippi, and he called for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to petition the Supreme Court and allow diversion of Lake Michigan
water in order to get the traffic flowing again.
   Sinner said the one-day conference would address how to prevent
farmers struggling because of the drought from going broke and
leaving the land and devising a long-term solution to dropping
water tables throughout the northern tier and Western United States.
   Lyng said the federal government's response would include
expansion of existing crop insurance and disaster loan programs. He
also cited the creation of task forces in the Congress and within
President Reagan's administration preparing to respond to problems
of the drought.
   Lyng left the conference after his speech, but said he would
meet with Reagan on Friday morning to update him on the drought
situation.
   Attending the day-long meeting, besides Sinner and Thompson,
were the governors of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Montana, South Dakota,
Mississippi, Ohio, Kansas and Nebaska.
   Lyng announced a toll-free number for farmers affected by the
drought and seeking federal help. The number is 1-800-541-3375.

<TEXT>
   Despite scandals in the pulpits and problems on
Wall Street, Americans reached deeper than ever into their pockets
last year to give more than $93 billion to philanthropic
organizations, according to a study.
   The $93.68 billion tallied in the annual report ``Giving USA''
was almost 6.5 percent more than the $88 billion given in 1986. The
increase was nearly twice the rate of inflation, which rose by 3.7
percent, and topped the growth of personal income, which was just
under 6 percent in 1987.
   Eighty-two percent of all charitable donations came from
individual Americans. They contributed $76.82 billion, 6.65 percent
more than they gave in 1986.
   Only one major category of donor, U.S. corporations, failed to
give more than in 1986; they gave $4.5 billion in 1987, the same as
in 1986.
   Contributions by foundations rose by 8.14 percent to $6.38
billion and bequests from estates went up 7 percent to $5.98
billion.
   The figures were issued Wednesday by Nathan Weber, editor of the
annual report of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel
Trust for Philanthropy.
   The October stock market crash, loss of deduction for
non-itemizing income-tax payers and the scandals of fund-raising TV
evangelists all presaged a decline in giving, but ``in the face of
this, it increased significantly,'' said Weber.
   The biggest gift of the year was Norton Simon's donation of art
worth $750 million to the University of California.
   Among the list of million-dollar-or-more donors were Paul
Newman, who gave $5 million to his children's camp in Connecticut;
T. Boone Pickens, who gave West Texas State University $1.5
million, and Bill Cosby, who gave $1.3 million to Fisk University.
   Among the reasons corporate donations flattened out was what the
report called ``the inevitable running out of steam'' after nearly
a decade of enormous increases.
   The report also said serious economic difficulties befell key
corporations, ``notably oil companies and the `rust belt'
manufacturers of the Midwest and Northeast.''
   The woes of TV evangelists notwithstanding, religion came in for
its usual 40 percent to 50 percent share of donations. The estimate
for 1987 was $43.6 billion, almost 47 percent of all charity
contributions.
   The rest broke down as $13.65 billion to health groups and
hospitals, $10.84 billion to education, $9.84 billion to human
services, $6.41 billion to the arts and humanities, $2.44 billion
to social activist causes and $6.89 billion to others.

   Gov. Rose Mofford says she is recovering
from the concussion she suffered a month ago and still intends to
run for governor in 1990.
   ``I've made the bend and am starting to feel better again,''
Mrs. Mofford said during a two-hour appearance Wednesday at the
Tucson Rotary Club, her first public outing of more than three
minutes since her injury in a fall.
   At one point, she raised her arms and emphatically told the
luncheon audience, ``If I didn't quit when I became acting
governor, I'm not gonna quit now.''
   She took office upon the state Senate's conviction April 4 of
impeached Gov. Evan Mecham.
   She joked about her fall off a dais in Yuma, saying, ``Today is
exactly one month that the Phoenix Cardinals were trying to sign me
up.'' In the incident, Cardinals' Coach Gene Stallings accidentally
grabbed onto her as he fell backward, knocking her from her chair
and causing her to hit her head.
   The 66-year-old governor said her doctor has told her to limit
her activity, but she added, ``I'm doing pretty good and I'm making
a good comeback. That was quite a fall.''

<HEAD>Moscow Synagogue to Acquire Building It Lost During War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials agreed Thursday to return a
building now used as a medical institute to the synagogue that
owned it before World War II, two American and Soviet rabbis
announced.
   ``We asked for this five years ago, 15 and 20 years ago, but no
one would listen,'' the Soviet Union's chief rabbi, Adolf
Shayevich, said in an interview.
   The return of the two-story building to the Choral Synagogue on
Arkhipova Street in central Moscow fits a pattern of liberalization
that began during preparations for the celebration of the 1,000th
anniversary of Christianity in Russia.
   During the celebration earlier this month, the government
returned a monastery it had controlled in Kiev and several churches
throughout the country to the Russian Orthodox Church. The Soviet
government has taken over church property since the 1920s.
   After the structure was built more than 100 years ago, the
synagogue used it for Jewish community activities, but the
government took it away in 1941 and made it into a hospital for
World War II casualties, Shayevich said. It now houses a training
center for doctors. It is adjacent to the beige synagogue, and the
two doors connecting it to the synagogue are sealed.
   Arthur Schneier, a New York rabbi, said he began campaigning 1{
years ago for the return of the building but made progress with
Soviet officials just in the past two weeks, during the millennium
of Christianity.
   ``It's part of a process that seeks to align religious believers
with restructuring and rebuilding of society,'' Schneier said in an
interview in a synagogue office. ``They are trying to reach out to
the masses.''
   He said the return of the building ``would have been
unthinkable'' during his first visit in 1966 and ``improbable five
years ago.''
   Schneier said Moscow's deputy mayor, Gennady D. Arzhanov, agreed
on behalf of the Moscow City Council Thursday to turn over the
building to the synagogue. The oral agreement is to be followed up
with a formal contract later.
   Schneier said the Jewish congregation he represents at New
York's Park East Synagogue will help pay for restoration of the
building and will send architects and construction specialists to
offer advice. He predicted the building could be used within two
years for adult Jewish education classes and a museum.
   The New York synagogue also has agreed to help the medical
institute find other quarters, Schneier said.

   The House of Representatives telephone system
went dead Thursday for the fourth time in two weeks, silencing half
of Congress and leading one lawmaker to complain that Alexander
Graham Bell would be ``depressed and despondent.''
   The widespread outage brought howls from congressmen cut off
from their constituents and district offices, and prompted a
scramble by top officials of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
which installed the $16 million system, to find out what went wrong.
   ``I don't know what motivated this installation of the new
system, but it's certainly proven to be a failure,'' Rep. Walter
Jones, D-N.C., complained.
   Had Bell, the inventor of the telephone, been around during the
last two weeks, he ``would have been most depressed and despondent,
to say nothing of being embarrassed,'' Jones said.
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said the communications glitch reminded
him of the AT&T television commercials showing distraught employees
bemoaning their choice of a phone system and discussing how their
businesses had been ruined. The commercials end by proclaiming AT&T
``the right choice.''
   ``Well, in the interest of ... truth in advertising, I think we
ought to admit that the same source of that advertising is the one
that has the telephone system here in the House,'' Kolbe said in a
floor speech.
   When the system went down for the first time last week, he said,
``it was kind of nice to have the break. No calls coming in, quiet
in the offices. Everybody went off and got a Coke or did
something.''
   But as the outages kept recurring, he said, ``tempers
increased.''
   Members and staff described variously everything from totally
dead telephones to intermittent operation of some lines. Calls
could not be transferred. At times, all the lights on a telephone
would go on at once and all the phones in an office would ring
simultaneously.
   Officials in the House clerk's office, which administers the
phone system, said they were working feverishly to find out what
had gone wrong and that AT&T had sent its top technical experts
from all over the country to help diagnose the problem.
   ``It's a flukey sort of thing,'' said Deputy House Clerk Ray
Colley. The switching system which is the heart of the telephone
network is a computerized AT&T System 85, which is in wide use and
has not been a problem elsewhere, he said.
   Colley said he believed the House system, which has some 17,000
telephones, is one of the largest in the country.
   ``We're losing a lot of calls, obviously,'' he said. ``Believe
me, we have total attention from AT&T.'' Technicians suspected a
software problem but were examining everything, including the
possibility of computer hackers tampering with the system from
outside, he said.
   An AT&T spokesman, Herb Linnen, said the company had pulled
together its best technical minds and was working ``around the
clock'' to resolve the problem.
   ``We do not know the cause. We have tried to replicate the
calling situation of the House in our Bell Lab facilities in Denver
to see if we can spot a software or hardware problem, but we have
not been able to replicate it,'' he said.
   Linnen said the company was ``totally empathetic'' with
lawmakers' frustration. ``We are frustrated. We have a commitment
to get the ... problem fixed as quickly as possible,'' he said.
   The system was installed last August, and after some initial
startup problems worked fine until it went dead for the first time
last week, Colley said. Since then, outages of an hour or more
occurred on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
   House Clerk Donnald K. Anderson defended the system. ``We've got
the best system on the market,'' he said. ``I still have confidence
in System 85.''
   Meantime, Kolbe had a suggestion for members frustrated by being
unable to communicate with constituents: use the House floor and
its television system as an ``electronic billboard'' to send open
messages back home.
   ``And if nothing else works, my staff has come up with a
prototype system,'' he said, holding up a pair of styrofoam coffee
cups linked by a piece of wire.
   ``If I get the contract for $10 million or so to install this in
the House of Representatives, I promise that it will work just as
well as the phone system we have here now.''

   Here are some facts and figures about Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas and shares frontiers
with India, China, Thailand and Laos. Resources include fertile
soil, timber, oil and other minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the
heart of the country, is the second largest and the center of
traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins
and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism and
education is widespread.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $200 a year,
putting Burma among the poorest nations. It once was the world's
leading rice exporter but experienced spot food shortages in 1987.
Its economic failure is generally attributed to poor government
management and a crippling war against several ethnic minorities
seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid donors and
the United States has a modest assistance program, mainly in the
anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled it from
1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy,
a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He has
imposed isolationism, military control and socialist economics.
   Burma seeks to keep out most foreign influence, including joint
ventures with foreign companies, and has been nicknamed ``Asia's
hermit.'' Tourists are allowed to stay only one week.

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge landslides roared through eastern
Turkey today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a
coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide,
authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried.
   Rescue teams recovered three bodies under the wreckage, the
Anatolia News agency reported.
   The state radio reported that 31 people were injured in the
disaster in Catak village in a mountainous area of Trabzon
province, about 350 miles northeast of Ankara and not far from the
Black Sea.
   ``I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,''
the news agency quoted a witness, Zeki Ilhan, as saying.
   Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a
restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports.
   The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed
with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after
the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight,
the reports added.
   Deputy Gov. Erkan Isilgan of Trabzon province told The
Associated Press by telephone that rescue teams feared the death
toll would climb since so many people were missing.
   Isilgan said rescuers were trying to find out whether the
passengers included any foreign tourists.
   Rain hampered rescue operations. Anatolia quoted an official
supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as
two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued.
   Public Works Minister Safa Giray, who flew to the site, told
Anatolia that rescue teams might recover some people alive. ``That
is what we hope,'' he said.
   The radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to search for
victims because of threats of more landslides.
   The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to
drive away the mud and stone which covered the site.
   Anatolia said the landslides struck along a stretch of road
where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight,
when an earlier landslide blocked the highway.
   The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after
the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess.
   Provincial Gov. Enver Hizlan was quoted as saying the army would
be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior,
public works and energy ministers, flew to Trabzon from Ankara.
   Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed
on extensive deforestation.

<HEAD>US Welcomes `Flexible Approach' By Angola On Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States welcomed on Thursday what it
hoped was a ``flexible approach'' by Angola toward negotiations to
end a 13-year-old war between Cuban-backed government forces and
U.S.-supported guerrillas.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, noting reports
that the Angolan government is willing to enter peace discussions
without demanding cessation of U.S. support for the rebels, said
``we welcome a flexible approach to these very complex problems
we're addressing.''
   His comments were made on the eve of U.S., Cuban, South African
and Angolan talks in Cairo on a possible settlement of the conflict
that has enflamed southern Africa for more than a decade.
   One of the stumbling blocks in recent years has been Angola's
unwillingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Cuban forces in the
country as long as the United States backed the guerrilla forces of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
   UNITA receives more than $15 million a year in U.S. assistance.
   In Thursday editions, The New York Times quoted Angolan Justice
Minister Fernando Franca Van Dunem as saying U.S. support for UNITA
would not be an issue in the talks about to begin.
   ``It is not appropriate for us to raise the issue now,'' the
minister said. ``We will raise it with the United States
separately, at another juncture. The issue is not on the table for
the current negotiations. We should not mix these subjects.''
   Redman said that ``the U.S. position has always been that that
is not a subject for discussion and it has never been on the table
in these negotiations.''
   The American spokesman also said Secretary of State George P.
Shultz would meet next week with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
   After Shultz met with the Angolan government delegation on
Wednesday, the department issued a statement declaring ``the United
States believes that the quickest way to end the conflict that has
already consumed the lives of thousands of Angolans, is for
Angolans themselves to meet and resolve their differences
peacefully and without the pressures and interference of outside
forces.''

<HEAD>Second Day of News Strike Keeps Papers Off Stands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide journalists' strike, in its second day
on Thursday, kept nearly all of Italy's national newspapers off the
newstands and reduced state-run broadcasts to bare-bone accounts.
   The contract dispute also stilled news agencies, including the
two major national ones, ANSA and AGI.
   Among the missing papers were the leading sports dailies, but
for soccer fans, it was probably just as well. The strike meant no
post-mortems of Wednesday's night match between Italy and the
Soviet Union, which saw the Soviets kill the Italians' title hopes
for the European championship.
   The state broadcasting network RAI had carried the match live to
show the journalists' ``sensibility'' to the nation's soccer fever.
The broadcast, which involves the services of journalists, was the
only exception on Wednesday to the no-work day.
   On Thursday, however, RAI radio and television carried reduced
newscsts, without video or audio services. Instead, an announcer
designated by the journalists' union read the news in reduced form,
including a declaration of why the strike was called.
   The strike was scheduled to end Friday, allowing the publication
of Saturday's newspapers.
   Local papers and some that are outside the union, such as the
leftist Manifesto, did publish.
   Officials of the National Press Federation called the strike,
which began Wednesday morning, over a breakdown in negotiations.
   Publishers and union officials have agreed on a $381 monthly pay
increase in the new contract.
   But the unions are want a clause preventing newspaper chains
from using a central newsroom to provide national and international
news for the group, and publishers say that would be too costly.

<HEAD>Rival Palestinian Factions Battle For Control of Camps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions
battled with mortars and machine guns Thursday for control of two
refugee camps in Beirut. Police said two people were killed and
nine wounded.
   In a related development, the Abu Nidal group issued a threat to
assassinate Yasser Arafat's chief spokesman for issuing a statement
saying the Palestine Liberation Organization was ready to recognize
Israel.
   The camp fighting raised the overall toll to 53 people killed
and 215 wounded since the latest round of the war between Arafat's
mainline Fatah guerrillas and Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising
broke out 14 days ago.
   By police count, 102 people have been killed and 468 wounded in
the camps of Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh since the two factions
began their bloody feud May 1.
   A police spokesman said Mousa's guerrillas, dislodged from the
two shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting, shelled the camps
from Syrian-controlled territory in west Beirut early in the day.
   He said shells slammed into the two camps at the rate of one
every 10 minutes at certain times. The shantytowns have suffered
from repeated attacks from Israel and Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem
militias since 1982.
   The spokesman said sniper fire ``kept most roads in the two
camps closed throughout the day.'' He could not be dentified in
line with standing regulations.
   The fighting continued despite repeated efforts by neutral
guerrilla groups and Libyan mediators to arrange a cease-fire
between Fatah and Mousa's group.
   The cease-fire broke down in part because of a statement issued
by Arafat chief spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif saying the PLO was
willing to recognize Israel's existence.
   On Thursday, the Abu Nidal faction issued a veiled threat to
kill him.
   ``Abu Sharif is acting like the interred traitor Issam
Sartawi,'' said a statement from Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council published by Beirut's leftist as-Safir daily.
   Sartawi, a roving ambassador for Arafat, was assassinated in
Madrid in 1983. The PLO blamed Abu Nidal's group, which opposes any
negotiations with Israel.
   Sartawi was among the most moderate PLO leaders. He had met with
Israeli moderates before he was killed.
   Abu Sharif ``expresses the willingness of the group represented
by Arafat ... to negotiate with the Zionist entity,'' the statement
said.
   Abu Sharif said in a statement released in Tunis, Tunisia,
earlier this month that the PLO was willing to recognize Israel and
accept a Palestinian homeland in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip as a solution to the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Abu Sharif's unusually conciliatory proposals drew strong
condemnation from five Syrian-backed guerrilla groups.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke with Arafat
in 1974. He is wanted in the United States and Western Europe for a
chain of terrorist attacks, including the December 1985 Vienna and
Rome airport attacks in which 16 people were killed.
   In Kuwait, the Al-Qabas daily reported Thursday that the U.S.
administration will deal with the PLO if it publicly endorses Abu
Sharif's statement.
   The newspaper quoted ``reliably informed Western diplomatic
sources'' as saying in a report from Paris that this had been
conveyed to Arafat through an unidentified third party.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said this week that
the statement by Abu Sharif was a positive step, but stressed it
lacked the authoritative support of the PLO leadership.
   Al-Qabas quoted diplomatic sources as saying the Americans
considered Abu Sharif's statement as ``the first PLO statement
which talks in detail about the Palestinians' desire to live in
peace with the Israelis and the existence of an agreement between
the Palestinians and the Israelis to live in peace and security.''

<HEAD>Harmony on Credentials: Rules Fights To Come</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats for the first time are headed to
their national convention with no fights pending over delegates
after the Credentials Committee on Thursday ratified the names on
the roll to be called in Atlanta.
   Harmony and winning in November were the sounds from the
campaigns of nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis and remaining rival
Jesse Jackson.
   ``Reverend Jackson wishes to insure, by starting in unity with
this committee today, that the tone will be set for a united
convention leading to a united Democratic victory in November,''
said Toney Anaya, the former New Mexico governor speaking for
Jackson.
   ``Jesse Jackson has made us all proud. Michael Dukakis is
looking forward to a very unified and winning convention in
Atlanta,'' replied Joe Warren of Massachusetts, speaking for his
governor. ``He is especially thankful to the Jackson campaign for
the determination to make 1988 the year of the Democrats.''
   The campaigns had cut deals in recent days to resolve each of
the remaining battles about delegates who will meet in Atlanta July
18-21. Jackson complaints about delegates in Pennsylvania and
Puerto Rico _ which were not filed as challenges _ are being worked
out privately.
   But Anaya warned that fights were to come this weekend when the
convention Rules Committee meets to talk about 1992 and beyond.
   ``There is still some disagreement with party rules, state and
national,'' he said. ``Reverend Jackson has determined the proper
place to take those disagreements is the Rules Committee and seek
changes prospectively.''
   Ann Lewis, a top Jackson adviser, said the candidate wants
changes that will bring the delegate totals in 1992 closer to the
primary vote. He wants those changes written into the rules by the
1988 convention.
   The credentials meeting in Washington _ the only one scheduled _
was a quiet affair as the group slowly ratified every deal that was
cut to settle the total of 21 delegate challenges. The group also
put its stamp of approval on the delegates from all the states
which had not been questioned.
   And a lack of credentials fights in Atlanta suits Democratic
National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk just fine.
   ``We never get a second chance in life to make a first
impression,'' Kirk said. ``When we think about what we are doing
today, I think it is the first time in recent political history _
as far back as the secretary's office can advise us _ we've never
started out the general election process at the Democratic
convention free of credentials challenges.
   ``I think it's a credit to the presidential campaigns ... to
settle these differences without rancor, in a sense of unity so we
can begin this process with an eye on November.''
   ``The chair will be absolutely delighted if on the evening news,
nothing appears on television about us,'' added committee chairman
K. Leroy Irvis of Pennsylvania.
   Irvis gaveled the resolutions through methodically, joking at
one point as he called for a vote: ``Those who approve say aye.
Those who disapprove nay _ we won't hear them anyway.''
   The last four battles to be resolved were Jackson delegate
squabble in Indiana, Kansas and Virginia and a spat between the
national party and Maine.
   In the first two states, a few extra delegates were added _
without increasing the number of votes _ to settle fights.
   In Indiana, two delegates were added with full votes to enable
both current Gary Mayor Thomas Barnes and former Gary Mayor Richard
G. Hatcher _ and one supporter each _ to go to Atlanta. Barnes
defeated Hatcher in the Democratic mayoral primary last year.
   Originally, Barnes and his supporter, Rudy Clay, were elected
delegates, but Hatcher challenged that in court, arguing that he
and his supporter, Carlos Tolliver, should be seated. Now all four
will go and the votes of four other Indiana delegates backing
Jackson will be cut in half to make room.
   This settlement, worked out Thursday morning, was slightly
different from what officials said the deal was on Wednesday.
   In Kansas, Jackson picks up six more delegates with a half vote
each. Five delegates for Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and one for Dukakis _
challenged by Jackson _ will go to the convention, but with half
votes.
   Thus, Jackson will gain three votes in Kansas, while Gore will
lose 2.5 votes and Dukakis half a vote.
   In Virginia, four Jackson supporters who were tossed off the
delegate list by other Jackson backers dropped their challenge,
credentials officials said.
   In Maine, the state party ignored a national rule setting a
threshold of 15 percent support before a candidate or group could
win delegates to the national convention. The state convention last
month gave three delegates to an uncommitted slate, even though it
had only 13 percent support at the meeting.
   To settle the argument, the three uncommitted delegates have
been accepted as Dukakis delegates by the campaign, even if they
don't vote for the Massachusetts governor.

Cambodia so it can improve relations with other countries.
   ``The renovation in relations between Vietnam and foreign
countries is very important,'' the official Voice of Vietnam radio
quoted Do Muoi as saying.
   According to the broadcast, Do Muoi ``said that to widen
cooperation, first of all, it is necessary to maintain peace and
security. Vietnam is striving to solve the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
issue.''
   He said if possible, Vietnam will withdraw all its estimated
120,000 soldiers before 1990, its self-imposed deadline for a total
pullout. Other Vietnamese officials previously have said an early
withdrawal is possible if a political settlement is reached.
   Vietnam is to begin this month what it says is a pullout of
50,000 troops, the largest annual pullout.
   Do Muoi, a 71-year-old veteran organizer in the ruling Communist
Party and its third-ranking official, was named Wednesday by the
National Assembly to replace Pham Hung, who died in March.
   Many non-communist Western and Asian countries have embargoed
economic aid to Vietnam since it invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Hanoi-based diplomats say that in the past two years, Vietnam's
new pragmatic leadership _ which gives priority to economic
development _ has made a series of diplomatic initiatives on
Cambodia. Before that, Vietnamese diplomats said the situation was
``irreversible.''
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach announced in Bangkok earlier
this week that he will attend unprecedented peace talks involving
Cambodian guerrilla factions next month in Indonesia.
   Do Muoi said Vietnam has established good ties with India and
Indonesia, and there were prospects for such ties with the pro-West
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN groups Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the Philippines.
   The premier said Vietnam is ``seeking all means'' to hold peace
talks with China. Relations between the two countries have been
tense since they fought a bloody border war in early 1979.
   On Wednesday, Do Muoi pledged to continue Western-style economic
reforms. A Radio Hanoi report seen here Thursday said he told the
National Assembly he will ``thoroughly grasp the renovative
spirit'' of reform resolutions adopted at a December 1986 party
congress.
   The party has blamed years of orthodox Marxist policies for an
economy that is one of the world's poorest. The reforms involve
decentralization of management, material incentives and limited
free enterprise.

<HEAD>Construction of Part of Shopping Center Near Manassas Battlefield
Halted</HEAD>

   Construction of part of a shopping center
adjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park will be halted
indefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials said today.
   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Betty Rankin, president of the
Save the Battlefield Coalition, which has been fighting the
proposed William Center complex.
   ``The Army Corps of Engineers has accomplished, at least
temporarily, what developers and the county refused to do. We all
feel relieved,'' she said.
   The cease-and-desist order issued Wednesday applies to work
being done at Young's Branch, a creek running through the Civil War
battlefield site, and on adjacent wetlands. Developers
Hazel@Peterson Cos. have started construction of one of two roads
that would cross the creek.
   The stop-work order, which extends indefinitely, was issued
because the developers violated a corps provision requiring that
the Army be notified when a project could affect a historic
property, said corps spokesman Bill Brown.
   ``Our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek,'' Brown
said. ``That work could have an impact on the park.''
   John T. (Til) Hazel, president of the development group, has 10
days from receipt of the letter to explain why the Army wasn't
notified about the road, Brown said.
   The stop-work order could entirely block construction of the
project or force the developer to alter its design if an
investigation determines that the park would be adversely affected,
Brown added.
   Preservationists claim construction of the massive project,
which includes a 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million
square feet of office space and 560 homes, would destroy 50 acres
of wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughout
the 542-acre tract.
   Historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity of
the still-rustic setting of two crucial Civil War battles.
   Robert Kelly, a spokesman for Hazel@Peterson, told The
Washington Post that his firm would do everything in its power to
comply with the Army's requests.
   The work-stoppage order came as proposals to block the project
were gaining momentum in Congress.
   On Tuesday, a House Interior and Insular Affairs panel held a
hearing on several congressional proposals to take control of the
development tract and add it to the 4,600-acre park.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., on Wednesday offered legislation that
would deprive Hazel@Peterson of direct access to the site from
Interstate 66. The measure failed in the appropriations
subcommittee, but Warner said he would introduce it before the full
Appropriations Committee.

<HEAD>States Must Plan Now To Cope With Minority Work Force, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of people entering
the work force over the next decade will be women, minorities and
immigrants, and they are likely to be stuck in low-level,
low-paying jobs, a private study said Thursday.
   The study by the Institute for Educational Leadership, a
Washington-based think tank, said steps must be taken now to assure
these new workers have adequate education and job choices.
   The study drew its data from demographic analyses of several
``indicator'' states considered representative of the nation's
population: New York, Florida, Connecticut, Michigan, Texas,
California, Indiana, Arizona, Delaware, Kentucky and Ohio.
   It concluded that 20 million people will start work between now
and the year 2000, and that 83 percent of them will be women,
minorities and immigrants.
   Unless better education opportunities are provided, the jobs
available to these new workers will continue to be low-level,
low-paying service positions, the study said.
   For example, for every computer programmer hired in the United
States, there will be 13 new jobs for cashiers, the study said.
   States in the Southwest will feel a decided impact on their
student populations and work force from the increasing numbers of
Hispanics, while the Southeastern states will face pressures from
the growing number of blacks, the study said. States like New York,
Florida and California will have to make sure they have resources
to provide for a fast-growing elderly population.
   ``There are significant challenges ahead which will require all
sectors of society to join together if our states are to provide
quality education and meaningful employment,'' said Harold
Hodgkinson, a senior fellow at the institute.
   The institute includes representatives from education, business
and the media. It is supported by various private foundations and
also receives some federal money.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Debate Counting Illegal Aliens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question
of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether
following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that
is unfair to citizens.
   The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would
require the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the
country legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in
reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
   ``This is a fairness issue,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa.,
who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens
benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra
seats in the House.
   Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a House
member another must lose one.
   Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of
illegal aliens at 2 million. The result, he said, was that Georgia
and Indiana lost House seats to New York and California.
   Subcommittee Chairman Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., however, said
he is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others are
constitutional.
   The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound all
the ``persons'' in the country every 10 years for purposes of
reapportionment. It doesn't specify citizens.
   ``I am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents
of the United States are not `persons,''' Dymally said.
   Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have been
excluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do not
want to return to a time when some human beings are considered less
than equal in the eyes of the law.''
   ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted
all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal
aliens,'' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never the
intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment
purposes.''
   And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry over
counting aliens ``hysterical,'' pointing out that the movement of
Americans into western and southern states has had a much larger
effect on representation than the presence of aliens.
   The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the
effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and
complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the
truth anyway.
   But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,
asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens' basic
right to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress
to states where the aliens live.
   And Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens
``in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individuals
who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the United
States.''

<HEAD>Car Deal Turns Sour, Dozens Detained in Restaurant Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two gangs that disagreed about payment in a car
deal drove into downtown Moscow and battled it out with wooden
clubs and metal rods in a popular restaurant, newspapers reported
Thursday.
   Police investigator N. Chekmazov told the Moscow city newspaper
Lenin's Banner that 36 people, including witnesses and victims,
were detained after the clash at the Uzbekistan Restaurant on
Wednesday night.
   He said two gangs disagreed about terms of a car
buying-and-selling deal they made Monday in Southern Port, a site
on the Moscow River notorious for illegal trading in cars. The
gangs spent two days ``mobilizing their forces'' before coming to
blows at the restaurant, Chekmazov said.
   The newspaper said in a separate dispatch by the Tass news
agency that the gangs arrived at the restaurant in their own cars.
   Neither Chekmazov nor Tass gave details of the car deal that
turned sour.
   Those arrested, who were mostly from Moscow's outskirts, ranged
in age from 22 to 30 and included six people with criminal records.
Lenin's Banner published a Tass dispatch saying the gangs were
armed with wooden clubs and metal rods. It did not give a figure
for the number of injured.
   Soviet newspapers have covered crime more extensively since
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev launched his ``glasnost'' policy
of openness on selected social, historical and other issues three
years ago.

   Huge landslides roared through eastern
Turkey today, crashing into houses, a school, a line of cars and a
coffeehouse jammed with people stranded by an earlier slide,
authorities said. Up to 100 people were believed buried.
   Rescue teams recovered at least three bodies in the rubble, the
Anatolia News agency reported.
   The dispatch said at least 18 people were injured in the
disaster in a mountainous area of Macka township, about 350 miles
northeast of Ankara and not far from the Black Sea.
   ``I saw the mountain coming over me and started running away,''
the news agency quoted a witness, Zeki Ilhan, as saying.
   Landslides struck at least three houses, four stores, a
restaurant and a high school, according to news agency reports.
   The school was in summer recess. But the coffeehouse was packed
with at least 30 bus passengers who had been waiting there after
the highway was closed by an earlier landslide just after midnight,
the reports added.
   Deputy Gov. Erkan Isilgan of Trabzon province told The
Associated Press by telephone that rescue teams feared the death
toll would climb since so many people were missing.
   Isilgan said rescuers were trying to find out whether the
passengers included any foreign tourists.
   Rain hampered rescue operations. Anatolia quoted an official
supervising the rescue operation as saying it could take as long as
two weeks to clear the debris if rainfall continued.
   Public Works Minister Safa Giray, who flew to the site, told
Anatolia that rescue teams might recover some people alive. ``That
is what we hope,'' he said.
   The state radio reported rescue teams were moving slowly to
search for victims because of threats of more landslides.
   The dispatch said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were trying to
drive away the mud and stone which covered the site.
   Anatolia said the landslides struck along a stretch of road
where several cars were waiting in line since just after midnight,
when an earlier landslide blocked the highway.
   The bus passengers had been waiting in the coffee house after
the highway was closed, the reports added. Schools were in recess.
   Provincial Gov. Enver Hizlan was quoted as saying the army would
be called in to help. The ministers of transportation, interior,
public works and energy ministers, flew to Trabzon from Ankara.
   Some landslides which have occurred in the area have been blamed
on extensive deforestation.

<HEAD>Admiral Gets Confidential Recommendations in Mirecki Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigative officer has made
confidential recommendations on whether an officer and five
instructors should be court-martialed for the death of a recruit at
the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, a spokesman confirmed Thursday.
   Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio, a Navy legal services officer
stationed in Philadelphia, made the recommendations, based on
hearings earlier this month, to Rear Adm. David R. Morris, chief of
naval air training, said Morris spokesman Lt. Lee Saunders.
   Morris is expected to make a decision before he leaves his
present job July 1 to take command of an aircraft carrier battle
group in the Atlantic Ocean. But depending on what he decides, the
disclosure of his action may be delayed until after that date,
Saunders said.
   Morris may decide to call for a court-martial, non-judicial
punishment or dismissal of the charges.
   The five instructors were charged with involuntary manslughter
and conspiracy to commit battery by forcing Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., into a swimming pool at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station and holding his head under water until
he collapsed. The alleged actions occurred when the sailor panicked
on March 2 and said he was quitting the rescue course.
   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in charge of the school, is
charged with the lesser offense of dereliction of duty. He has been
relieved of his command.
   During the hearings, a pathologist testified Mirecki died of
``sheer terror.'' The recruit's phobia of being dragged under water
triggered heart failure that was followed by drowning, the
pathologist said.
   Mirecki panicked during an exercise known as ``sharks and
daisies'' in which instructors grabbed students in head-holds to
simulate a panicking air crash survivor. The exercise now has
students practice rescue exercises on each other rather than
instructors.
   The school was closed March 29 and reopened Monday with
instructors barred from touching trainees. Students also are
required to immediately be pulled from training if they say they
want to quit or show fear, panic or excessive fatigue.

<HEAD>Three Israeli Children Hurt in Bus Stoning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Israeli children on their way back from a
school hike were hurt by flying glass when their bus was stoned in
an Arab neighborhood of east Jerusalem, a police spokesman said
Thursday.
   In a further sign of resurgent unrest that has struck Jerusalem
recently, outlawed Palestine Liberation Organization flags were
flown from utility poles in several parts of the city.
   West Bank commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna decided to free 89
Palestinian detainees and prisoners. An army official said the
decision followed appeals from Arab notables and was made ``to
contribute to the restoration of normal life.''
   The army said it would pardon 17 prisoners, stop proceedings
against 27 detainees, and cut short six-month prison terms of 45
administrative detainees. The Palestinians would be released
Friday, it said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking at a ceremony at the
National Police Headquarters, urged the police to suppress all
manifestations of unrest in Jerusalem.
   ``These threats must become a challenge to the Israeli police,
who should make a special effort to repel every attack and cut off
every hand that would be raised against the unity of Jerusalem, our
eternal capital,'' he said.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said the incidents appeared linked to
orders issued by underground Palestinian leaders in a leaflet
distributed Wednesday.
   The leaflet calls on Arabs to focus their disturbances on
Jerusalem to protest Israeli control of the disputed city. Israel
annexed the Arab sector of the city after driving out Jordanian
troops in 1967, but most countries have refused to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   Palestinian girls from a high school in the Shuafat quarter of
Jerusalem stoned two Israeli buses heading toward Neve Yaacov, an
isolated Jewish neighborhood surrounded by Palestinian communities,
Levy told The Associated Press.
   The 11-year-old Israeli children were returning from a visit to
Ammunition Hill, the site of a key battle in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Three students were hurt and treated at Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital, Levy said, adding that the injuries were believed to be
minor.
   Police detained several Palestinians, including Arab students,
he said.
   In a separate incident, a Palestinian stoned an Israeli bus on
Saleh el-Din Street, the main shopping thoroughfare in the Arab
part of the city, Levy said. The stone smashed a window but caused
no injuries, he said.
   The latest unrest, following a four-month lull in violence in
Jerusalem, began Saturday when Palestinian protesters blocked city
streets with stones and attacked a police van and a lookout post
atop the Old City's Damascus Gate.
   Also Thursday, the Israeli army accused the London-based human
rights group, Amnesty International, of using biased sources of
information and denied an Amnesty report that soldiers had killed
Arabs by using tear gas improperly in its fight against the Arab
uprising.
   The report accused Israeli soldiers of firing tear gas into
confined areas in violation of manufacturers' order, thus killing
at least seven Palestinians.
   But a military communique said soldiers had instructions not to
fire into rooms and said the tear gas used by Israel ``is not
dangerous to human life.''
   An electric power failure paralyzed most of the country and the
occupied territories, stopping factory production, causing traffic
snarls and disrupting telephone and other communications. The
electric corporation spokesman ruled out sabotage as a cause of the
outage.
   The power failure caused blackouts of up to three hours in most
parts of Israel, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It reached as
far south as the resort town of Eilat on the Egyptian border.
   Police spokesman Levy initially said police were investigating
whether the outage was the work of Palestinian saboteurs. However,
Avri Ravid, spokesman for the Israel Electric Corp., later told the
AP the failure was caused by a torn high tension wire.
   ``No person could have cut it,'' Ravid said. ``If anyone tried,
there would be nothing left of him.''
   Israeli officials and Palestinian landowners said mischievous
Israeli children and Jewish settlers seeking retaliation set some
of the blazes that have scorched thousands of acres of land since
May.
   Most of the 35,000 acres of greenery torched since this spring
were destroyed by Arab arsonists. Underground Arab leaders called
an ``Arson Day'' on Wednesday, and nine of the 14 fires which broke
out apparently were set by Palestinians, police said.

<HEAD>Weinberger's Ex-Colleague Disagrees, Says Pentagon Spending Is a
Mess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caspar Weinberger's former colleague in
private life _ brought in to the Pentagon to get control of
procurement _ says he quit in frustration last fall because
Weinberger and President Reagan failed to support his management
reforms.
   ``I differ 100 percent with the (former) secretary of defense
who said the system is fine but we have a few bad apples,'' said
Richard P. Godwin, the former undersecretary of defense for
acquisition who was brought into the Pentagon to carry out reforms
recommended by another Californian, industrialist David Packard.
   Godwin, the former president of Bechtel Civil and Minerals Inc.,
also said Weinberger, the former defense secretary, was ``100
percent wrong'' in defending the way the Pentagon buys weapons.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Godwin called the Pentagon
procurement process a ``national crisis,'' as serious for the
United States as drug trafficking and the AIDS epidemic.
   ``We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said the 66-year-old
Godwin, who worked with Weinberger at Bechtel before President
Reagan's election in 1980.
   Bechtel Civil and Minerals was a division of Bechtel Group Inc.,
the huge construction company based in San Francisco. Between
assignments in Republican administrations, Weinberger served as
vice president and general counsel of the Bechtel Group. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz was president of Bechtel Group from
1975-1982.
   Weinberger has said he thinks the Pentagon's weapons-buying
procedures are generally adequate, but it is impossible to
eliminate dishonesty on the part of some people.
   Reagan said on Tuesday that although he does not condone
misconduct, some corruption is ``understandable'' in an enterprise
as big as the defense department, which spends $160 billion a year
on acquisitions and which, Weinberger noted Wednesday, lets more
than 50,000 contracts a day.
   Godwin said he accepted the job as the first undersecretary of
defense for acquisition in 1986 with the understanding that he
would stay only as long as he felt he was effective.
   The post was created by Congress in the wake of a report by
Packard's presidential commission recommending changes in
procurement practices. Packard served as deputy secretary of
defense in the Nixon administration.
   ``I determined the job was not do-able in large part because of
the unwillingness to make some hard decisions,'' Godwin said.
   Specificially, Godwin said Weinberger and Reagan refused to give
him the support he needed to create a central management system for
acquisitions, giving one person control over Pentagon buying and
stripping service chiefs of some of their authority to decide which
weapons system should be bought.
   The service chiefs would no longer control the acquisitions
system, though they would carry out instructions, he said.
   His goal, Godwin said, was to run the Pentagon purchasing system
like a corporation since the Defense Department is ``the biggest
business in the world,'' involving in some way over 100 million
people and spending more money than the gross national product of
some countries.
   Asked why Reagan and Weinberger did not back him in the way he
felt he needed to create a central management system, Godwin said,
``I don't know. They just didn't support it.''
   The showdown, Godwin said, came when Air Force Secretary Edward
C. Aldridge Jr. complained Godwin was ``getting into
micromanaging'' the Air Force. Aldridge simply ignored the central
management plan and was not brought to heel by his superiors,
Godwin said.
   ``If you are ignored, I consider that as tantamount to
non-support,'' he said.
   Aldridge was not immediately available for comment, his
spokesman said.
   Without a central acquisitions system, no one person knows what
the Defense Department is spending on weapons and how costs are
being controlled, Godwin said. Moreover, no one is accountable, he
said.
   Instead, the service chiefs _ or ``warlords'' as Godwin called
them _ go their own way, establish fiefdoms, lobby Congress for
money and let contracts for weapons.
   Godwin, who serves on several boards of directors and operates
vineyards in Sonoma County, Calif., said he was unaware of the
federal investigation into allegations that bribes and gratuities
were paid for crucial information about Pentagon contracts and
secret information was passed from the Pentagon to defense
contractors.
   Authorities are looking into allegations that defense
contractors obtained classified information through their
consultants in order to get billions of dollars of defense
contracts.
   While Godwin said he did not come in contact with specific
incidents of wrongdoing, he said the entire system needs to be
overhauled.
   ``We have to make major changes in functions, authorities and
accountability,'' he said. One idea, Godwin said, is to have three
people running the Pentagon: one to oversee the military's
combat-readiness; one to deal with policy matters; and a third to
operate the Pentagon business.
   Asked if his policy disputes with Weinberger have soured their
relationship, Godwin replied: ``We are not as we were.''

<HEAD>Strong GNP Growth Prompts Administration to Boost Forecast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.6 percent
rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the Reagan
administration on Thursday to make what was once considered a
too-rosy forecast even rosier.
   After the October stock market collapse, many private economists
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year. They criticized
as unrealistic White House projections saying the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, would grow at a steady 2.9
percent pace, the same as in 1986 and 1987.
   But booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and
continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise
their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began
looking pessimistic.
   On Thursday, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council
of Economic Advisers, boosted the administration's GNP forecast for
all of 1988 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, he predicted that
consumer price inflation would hold steady at 4.3 percent.
   The administration is looking for a sixth straight year of
economic expansion, the longest in peacetime since the Civil War,
to bolster the chances for a Republican presidential victory in
November.
   Sprinkel said the expansion ``gives every indication of
continuing ... on into next year.''
   ``Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough,'' he told reporters.
``The economy is doing better than even we expected.''
   Private analysts said Sprinkel's growth projections now are on
target, but that his inflation forecast should be higher because of
the expected effect of the widespread drought on food prices.
   ``He's certainly right about better growth, ... but the rest is
just pie in the sky stuff,'' said Michael K. Evans, head of a
private economic consulting firm in Washington.
   ``We're not going to have double-digit inflation, but a
reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5
to 5.5 percent,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that an export-led
manufacturing boom and a surge of investment spending by businesses
kept the economy growing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.6 percent in the January-March period.
   The GNP, the broadest measure of economic health, grew to a
seasonal and inflation-adjusted annual level of $3.915 trillion, a
$34.6 billion increase from the fourth quarter of 1987.
   The latest figures represent a modest downward revision of a
previous estimate of GNP growth in the first quarter. A month ago,
the government put GNP growth at 3.9 percent. However, in April,
the initial estimate was a much lower 2.3 percent.
   The revision showed a bigger dip in federal spending, mostly
because of a decline in purchases of surplus farm commodities. The
growth in consumer spending also was estimated as somewhat slower _
3.8 percent instead of 4.3 percent.
   Earlier in the economic expansion, consumer spending fueled
economic growth. Now, manufacture of exports, spurred by the
cheaper dollar, and of equipment to help businesses to produce more
exports is leading growth.
   ``Really, you're substituting trade and capital spending as the
engines of the economy for consumption, and that's going to be the
structural change for the next several years,'' said James Annable,
chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago.
   Exports of goods and services were up a strong 22.8 percent in
the first quarter. Business investment in capital equipment shot up
33.1 percent, the fastest rise since the fourth quarter of 1983,
when the nation was beginning its recovery from the 1981-82
recession.
   The chief drags on growth in the quarter were federal spending,
down 25.7 percent, and residential construction spending, down 8.8
percent.
   The GNP in the fourth quarter of 1987 grew at an even stronger a
4.8 percent annual rate. However, much of that production went into
a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and back
lots.
   The mix of growth in the January-March period is considered
better, and it occurred with little pickup in inflation.
   A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 1.4
percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated 1.7 percent
and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth quarter.
   The concern now is that too much demand _ from American
consumers as well as from overseas buyers _ will strain factory
capacity, causing shortages and driving up prices later this year.
   With the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close, the signals
are mixed. Most economists are projecting slightly weaker economic
growth, with estimates ranging from 2 percent to 3.5 percent.
   In a second report Thursday, the Commerce Department said the
after-tax profits of U.S. corporations fell 1.0 percent in the
first quarter, the poorest showing since profits dipped 3.7 percent
in the first quarter of 1987. Profits were up a moderate 2.6
percent in the fourth quarter.
   Economists say lagging earnings could put pressure on businesses
to raise prices.

   The nation's businesses reported a 1.0 percent
decline in profits after taxes in the first three months of this
year, the poorest performance in a year, the government said
Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said profits dipped to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $144.2 billion, down $1.4 billion from the
last three months of 1987.
   It was sharpest drop since the first quarter of 1987, when
profits fell 3.7 percent. In the second and third quarters of last
year, after-tax earnings rose 4.3 percent and 5.5 percent,
respectively.
   Thursday's report on the January-March period represents a
downward revision from an estimate last month, when the department
said profits after taxes rose 0.5 percent.
   Many analysts believe lagging profits are a sign of inflation
because they expect companies to raise prices to make up for lost
ground.
   However, Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch,
said he believed most companies, remembering the painful cutbacks
they had to make when imports flooded the country in the early
1980s, will be very cautious about boosting prices.
   ``I think companies are going to take a bit of a longer-term
view and say, `Wait a minute, if we raise prices too quickly, we
may give some of that market share back to our foreign
competitors,''' he said.
   In other details of the report, the government said:
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, rose 0.6 percent to an annual
rate of $378.8 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in the fourth
quarter.
   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.1 percent to an annual
rate of $99.3 billion in the first quarter following a 2.2 percent
increase in the fourth quarter.
   _Corporate profits before taxes were down 1.4 percent to $281.5
billion annual level in the first quarter following a 0.2 percent
increase in the fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Former Bullfighter `El Cordobes' Loses Paternity Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court Thursday ruled against legendary
bullfighter Manuel Benitez, agreeing with an American woman who
alleged he fathered her 19-year-old son, the matador's lawyer said.
   Attorney Antonio de la Riva said three members of the five-judge
Supreme Court voted to overturn two lower court decisions against
Elizabeth Velasco.
   She said her son, also named Manuel Benitez, was conceived while
she lived with the millionaire bullfighter, known as ``El
Cordobes,'' from 1968 to 1972.
   Two judges voted against Ms. Velasco, a 38-year-old Santa
Monica, Calif., resident who first brought suit in 1982 against
Benitez, Spain's most popular matador during the 1960s and early
1970s.
   In the decision, the majority said the 52-year-old matador's
refusal to take a blood test was ``obstructionist behavior'' and a
clear sign of his fear the test would prove Ms. Velasco's claim.
   El Cordobes had argued the test represented an affront to his
honor.
   The Supreme Court ordered El Cordobes to pay the costs of Ms.
Velasco's original 1982 suit. It also ordered both of them to share
the costs of the latest appeal.
   Ms. Velasco's lawyer, Carlos Vinader, said he was ``greatly
satisfied'' by the ruling. He said the court had not officially
informed him of its decision.
   ``It's a good thing she has a strong heart,'' he said of
Velasco. ``She has suffered many injustices.''
   De la Riva said El Cordobes planned to appeal the decision to
the Constitutional Tribunal, Spain's highest court.
   In 1982, represented by attorney Marvin Mitchelson, Ms. Velasco
sought an award of $2 million and an obligation for child support
from a Cordoba court.
   She lost that suit and an appeal to a court in Seville, capital
of the Andalusian autonomous region.
   Ms. Velasco later dropped her demand for a cash settlement.
   El Cordobes and his wife of 13 years, Marina Freysee, have five
children.
   The flamboyant bullfighter, who retired in 1981 but gave benefit
performances in 1982 and 1986, emerged from humble origins to
become immensely popular and wealthy during his career which lasted
from 1958 to 1981.
   He is a businessman with a personal fortune estimated at $20
million.

   Two paddle-wheelers take off Friday for the
annual re-creation of a historic steamboat race, but the drought
that's drying up the Mississippi River could prompt officials to
eliminate some ports of call.
   The 10-day trip still will begin on schedule, said Capt.
Lawrence Keeton of the Mississippi Queen.
   Keeton said Thursday that river traffic was being shut down at
Memphis, Tenn., to allow for dredging of the shallow river channel.
But by the time the Mississippi Queen and its rival Delta Queen
reach that point, the river may be open, he said.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be thre just at the right place at the right
time,'' Keeton said.
   The company that operates both steamships said planned stops at
Greenville, Miss., Memphis, Carthersville, Mo., and Cairo, Ill.,
may have to be changed.
   Both ships are scheduled to steam into the port at St. Louis,
under the Gateway Arch, at 9 a.m. on the Fourth of July. Among
precautions being taken by the steamship company to assure safe
navigation of the shallower river will be the use of a towboat
pushing a barge with a 9-foot draft. The tow and barge will travel
ahead of the steamships, acting as a pathfinder.
   The ``race'' pits the Mississippi Queen against the Delta Queen
in what is billed as a re-enactment of the June 24, 1870, race
between the Natchez and the Robert E. Lee. However, instead of
trying to match the speed of that race _ which was won by the Lee
in three days, 18 hours and 14 minutes _ the two modern-day
steamboats will set a leisurely 10-day pace.
   The boats traditionally stop at Natchez, Vicksburg, Memphis and
other ports where passengers and crew from each vessel take part in
contests such as ``dueling calliopes,'' the ``Floozie Parade
Competition'' and a kite flying contest. Points gained during all
the events determine the winner of the ``race.''

<HEAD>Big Trade Bill Lands In Senate Hopper Again</HEAD>

   Senators dumped an overhauled version of their
vetoed, 1,000-page bill in the hopper Thursday and expressed
optimism that the measure will reach President Reagan's desk this
year.
   ``This represents a consensus on trade policy _ it's a consensus
that has been a long time in coming,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., told reporters.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he saw
``an excellent chance of getting trade legislation and I'm
optimistic.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said, however,
that there would not be time to take up the legislation at least
until late July. He said he wants to get all of the fiscal 1989
money bills through the Senate first.
   That timetable threatened to put the slimmed-down trade bill in
a time squeeze, with some lawmakers opposed to any such legislation
while others may be eager to wrap up congressional business and hit
the campaign trail.
   A similar bill quietly went into the House hopper last week and
there were signs that it might see faster action.
   The measure is shorn of a provision that would require companies
to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and major layoffs.
   As the lawmakers fielded questions at a news conference, the
Senate debated a separate plant-closings bill with provisions
identical to those removed from the trade bill.
   A similar plant-closings measure was pending in the House, and
lawmakers in both houses planned to vote on the measure before the
July Fourth break. Democratic leaders have been saying for three
weeks that prospects appear good for passage of separate
plant-closings legislation.
   Labor unions had lobbied against detaching the plant-closings
provision from the trade bill in April and refused to give in when
Democratic leaders asked them to go along with dropping it. The
leaders then pushed the bill with the provision intact despite
predictions that it meant a sure veto.
   This time union leaders again lobbied against detaching the
plant-closings provision. But Democratic leaders insisted on doing
so, a move that insulates them from election-year charges of
refusing to compromise on trade.
   Also dropped from the modified version of the trade bill were
provisions to restrict Alaska petroleum exports.
   They would limit exports from new oil refineries in Alaska to
70,000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output. Up to 50,000 barrels
a day could be exported to Canada but only after making a detour in
an American-flagged vessel to a port in the lower 48 states.
   President Reagan objected to both the plant-closings and Alaska
oil provisions in his veto of the earlier version of the
legislation.
   Central features of the measure would overhaul the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs to aid threatened U.S.
industries and retaliate against international trade violations.
   Other features range from repeal of the 1980 windfall profits
tax on oil industry earnings to substantial agricultural subsidy
programs.
   One feature targeted in Reagan's veto message but left intact
when seantors overhauled their measure would allow duty-free
imports of Caribbean ethanol, used for making gasohol. Corn
producers have been fighting to get it erased.
   ``All you have to do is look at the drought,'' Bentsen said.
``... They're not going to have the corn for ethanol.''
   Danforth appealed for support from farm groups.
   ``This bill is very good farm legislation,'' he said. ``As a
matter of fact I think it is the most significant agricultural
legislation that I've ever seen in the Senate.''
   It would provide $1.5 billion in payments to grain companies to
spur exports as well as millions of dollars to agribusinesses to
advertise their wares in global markets.
   Under the measure, wheat, feed grains and oilseed crop producers
would receive stepped-up subsidies aimed at stimulating global
sales if negotiators fail to make progress on farm issues in the
current Uruguay Round of world trade talks.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to CORRECT that association not the first

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has approved in principle
the registration of an association for homosexuals, a member of
parliament said Thursday.
   Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, a prominent sexologist and member of
parliament from the United peasant Party, said in an interview that
he was told by the Ministry of Health that homosexual associations
may be formed for different cities in Poland.
   It would be the second association for homosexuals in the East
Bloc. Hungary approved a similar association several months ago
after much public debate.
   The Polish associations will have the right to their own
publications and will be ``linked in some way to the public health
service,'' he said.
   According to Kozakiewicz, there are about 30 male homosexuals in
Warsaw who are willing to join the association, and a much larger
group which would support it.
   Kozakiewicz said he was approached last year by a small group of
homosexuals and was asked for help in winning permission for an
association. He said he met personally with Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,
minister of the interior, to discuss the matter.
   He received word that it was approved Wednesday from Deputy
Health Minister Jerzy Bonczak, he said.
   Homosexuality is legal in Poland and persecution of homosexuals
is unheard of. But it is much less open than in Western countries
and homosexuals have complained of intolerance and bigotry.
   For the first time in Poland last year, four representatives of
the nascent gay movement appeared on television, on a late-night
talk show ``Intimate Talks.'' They spoke frankly about their
problems, but appeared only with their backs to the camera.
   The unwillingness of homosexuals to identify themselves has been
considered one obstacle to the government's efforts to combat the
AIDS virus in Poland. Homosexuals have been asked to volunteer for
blood tests under an ambitious government program to counter the
disease, which has claimed at least three lives in Poland.

   The Federal Communications Commission voted
Thursday to impose the first fine under its decency standards on a
Missouri television station for broadcasting a ``pandering and
titillating'' sex comedy during prime time.
   The FCC voted 2-1 to levy the maximum $2,000 fine on KZKC-TV, a
UHF station in Kansas City, for showing the movie ``Private
Lessons'' at 8 p.m., a time at which the agency said children were
likely to be watching.
   The movie, broadcast May 26, 1987, is about a 15-year-old boy
who is seduced by his housekeeper and included scenes in which the
woman appeared bare-breasted. The FCC said the scenes ``were
neither isolated nor fleeting.''
   The commission said that while nudity and sexual themes are not
necessarily ``indecent,'' their context and treatment in ``Private
Lessons'' were.
   ``The movie included nudity and scenes depicting sexual matters
which were dealt with in a pandering and titillating manner,'' the
commission said.
   ``The story line of the seduction of a 15-year-old boy by an
older woman, together with the inclusion of explicit nudity, would
have commanded the attention of children and the sexual references
would have been readily understood by children who tuned into the
program,'' the FCC said.
   Attorney Tom Davidson, representing Media Central Inc. of
Chattanooga, Tenn., owner of KZKC-TV, said he was ``shocked and
surprised and outraged by the imposition of the maximum fine in
light of the circumstances.''
   Davidson said the punishment was unfair because the standards
are vague and this is the first time they have been applied to
television.
   ``We don't know what is indecent because the standard doesn't
provide any guidance,'' he said.
   The guidelines are being challenged in court by broadcasting
groups, news organizations and public interest advocates as being
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
   Media Central has not decided what action to take, Davidson
said. Station officials have said the movie was edited for
television by an inexperienced editor and violated its own
standards for good taste but that they took immediate corrective
action, including clarification of the station's policy on nudity.
   All three commissioners agreed that the movie was indecent and
that children are likely to be in the audience before midnight, but
Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said the commission has no
evidence there is a substantial number of unsupervised children in
the audience at that time.
   ``Parents, not the commission, should bear the primary
responsibility of deciding what their children should watch at
night,'' she said.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said surveys have shown that 42
percent of all children are watching TV at 8 p.m. and that ``it is
reasonable to assume that there are unsupervised children in the
audience.''
   Commissioner James H. Quello said the FCC's action was
significant because ``this serves notice that we are going to
enforce indecency standards'' in regard to television as well as
radio stations. It marked the first indecency finding against a TV
station and was the first time the agency imposed a fine under its
tough new standards.
   The FCC decided in April 1987 to toughen its existing decency
standards by applying the wording of a 1978 Supreme Court decision
that said indecent material is ``language or material that depicts
or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual
or excretory activities or organs.''
   The commission said indecent material may be aired only when
there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience.
In a subsequent ruling in November 1987, the FCC said it would
consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after
midnight. Previously the FCC had considered 10 p.m. the cutoff time.

   Jesse Jackson said Thursday he has decided in
his own mind whether he wants to be Michael Dukakis' running mate,
but said he has not shared that decision with the likely Democratic
presidential nominee.
   After reiterating his stance that he has earned serious
consideration for the post, Jackson was asked if he has privately
decided whether he wants the job.
   ``Privately, yes,'' he replied. But as to informing Dukakis on
his point of view, he said teasingly, ``No, that would be public.''
   He made the comments to reporters after a pre-convention meeting
with his state campaign chairmen from around the country who are in
Washington for briefings on convention strategy and planning.
   Jackson then departed for Puerto Rico, where he plans a series
of appearances over the next three days.
   Puerto Rico has been an object of Jackson complaints about
unfair distribution of delegates during the primary season. Jackson
won Puerto Rico's non-binding ``beauty contest'' primary, but all
57 delegates were awarded to Dukakis.
   Jackson said Thursday that ``no doubt there will be some
adjustments made in Puerto Rico'' in delegate distribution as there
has been in New Jersey, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, other states
where he objected to the way delegates were allocated.
   The island's governor, Rafael Hernandez Colon, said Thursday he
was considering Jackson's request for some of the delegates.
   Hernandez Colon said ``we are willing to examine a petition of
that nature within the context of the need for unity in the
Democratic Party, and always, in coordination with Dukakis'
campaign.''
   Hernandez Colon also said Jackson ``should be seriously
considered for the position (of vice president) since he won second
place in the primaries all over the United States.''
   Puerto Rico's 3.2 million people are U.S. citizens but do not
vote in general elections.
   Jackson was asked here whether he thinks Dukakis is giving him
fair and serious consideration for the vice presidential spot. He
said the process is ongoing.
   ``So far we are a part of the process. The process is one thing.
The conclusion ... is another,'' he said.
   He said, however, that so far, ``I feel positive about it. I
feel hopeful about it.''
   Regarding the non-publicized criteria that Dukakis is using to
pick a running mate, he said, ``Some judgment must be made on some
criteria which has not yet been established.''
   Jackson listed his own baseline criteria for a running mate _
ability to inspire youth, experience in the Third World and ability
to erase traditional discrimination based on race or sex.
   Although the focus for weeks has been on Jackson's vice
presidential aspirations, he is refusing to follow the other
runnerup candidates in endorsing Dukakis before the convention.
   ``That's somebody trying to get me to play some rules that are
not in the interest of my constituency,'' he said. ``My
constituency has a reason to continue our campaign to Atlanta'' and
take an active role in the platform, rules and credentials
committees.
   He said he would endorse the ticket ``at the appropriate time,''
if he loses the nomination, and said that ``those who have thrown
in the towel early, they are people who have fainted in the face of
adversity.''

   Puerto Rico's 3.2 million people are U.S. citizens but do not
vote in general elections.
   Jackson was asked here whether he thinks Dukakis is giving him
fair and serious consideration for the vice presidential spot. He
said the process is ongoing.
   ``So far we are a part of the process. The process is one thing.
The conclusion ... is another,'' he said.
   He said, however, that so far, ``I feel positive about it. I
feel hopeful about it.''
   Regarding the non-publicized criteria that Dukakis is using to
pick a running mate, he said, ``Some judgment must be made on some
criteria which has not yet been established.''
   Jackson listed his own baseline criteria for a running mate _
ability to inspire youth, experience in the Third World and ability
to erase traditional discrimination based on race or sex.
   Although the focus for weeks has been on Jackson's vice
presidential aspirations, he is refusing to follow the other
runnerup candidates in endorsing Dukakis before the convention.
   ``That's somebody trying to get me to play some rules that are
not in the interest of my constituency,'' he said. ``My
constituency has a reason to continue our campaign to Atlanta'' and
take an active role in the platform, rules and credentials
committees.
   He said he would endorse the ticket ``at the appropriate time,''
if he loses the nomination, and said that ``those who have thrown
in the towel early, they are people who have fainted in the face of
adversity.''

<HEAD>Debtors Threaten Premier Kenyan Hospital With Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenya's premier hospital may close because
it is owed about $1.8 million, a third of it by state-controlled
companies, its director said Thursday.
   ``We have no source of income other than fees paid by patients.
I don't see how we can continue unless debtors pay up,'' Briton
Watkins Pitchford said of the private 194-bed Nairobi Hospital.
   This week, he placed an advertisement in a newspaper appealing
to debtors to ``search your conscience and settle your bills.''
   ``If you don't do so now, it is very possible there may be no
Nairobi Hospital to turn to next time you and yours succumb to
illness,'' the ad said.
   Pitchford said the debt, owed by individuals, private and
state-owned companies, international organizations and diplomatic
missions, has accumulated since 1986. He refused to further
identify the debtors.
   Spokeswoman Carole Argwings-Kodhek said it was not feasible to
take legal action because the hospital has so many debtors.
   The 38-year-old establishment belongs to the 1,000-member Kenya
Hospital Association, a non-profit company with no share capital.
It employs 700 people, including 14 doctors and 300 nurses, and
operates one of this East African nation's two best equipped
intensive care units.
   Kenyans who have a choice shun the country's mismanaged state
hospitals, where patients often share beds or floor space and there
are drug shortages.
   Ill tourists, expatriate workers or diplomats traditionally go
to Nairobi Hospital.

<HEAD>Couple Works To Change Maryland State Motto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Linda and Tom Wolfe discovered
Maryland's motto when their son wrote a history report, and began
another campaign to persuade the General Assembly to change a motto
they consider sexist.
   The motto in Italian, ``Fatti maschii parole femine,'' means
``Manly deeds and womanly words,'' according to the state's
accepted translation.
   ``There it was right on the seal. ... It is pretty disgusting,''
Mrs. Wolfe said recently. She and her husband have formed MOMMA, or
Modernization of Maryland's Motto Association.
   Since mid-May about 400 people have signed the Wolfes' petition,
which hangs on the cash register at their College Park store, the
Smile Herb Shop. They hope to have 3,000 signatures on the petition
when they submit it to state officials.
   The Wolfes are not the first to try to change the motto. In
1978, a joint resolution requested a legislative committee to
devise ``a more appropriate state motto.''
   ``The motto is incompatible with the equal rights and privileges
accorded to women by the Constitution of the United States,'' read
the bill, which died in the Senate.
   During the past three centuries, scholars have debated the
motto's proper translation. ``Deeds are of more avail than words''
and ``Act boldly but speak softly'' are among the less offensive
translations, said Gregory Stiverson, former editor of Maryland
Manual, a handbook of state government.
   Stiverson believes a corrupt translation has created the motto's
sexist slant. While he favors a change in the traditional
translation, he said state legislative action may prove difficult.
Legislators argued at length a few years ago about whether
``maschii'' should be spelled with a single ``i,'' a double ``i''
or end in the letters ``ij.''
   In their campaign, the Wolfes contacted their legislator,
Delegate Timothy Maloney.
   ``Frankly I'm not convinced the motto itself is sexist,''
Maloney said, ``but if it is, we ought to change it.'' He said a
bill would most likely change the translation, not the motto.
   ``My concern is to just change it so that deeds and words are
not related to gender...and so (the motto) says something
positive,'' Linda Wolfe said.

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan will not be
charged with assault against a man whom he shot after calling
police to report a predawn prowler, the U.S. attorney's office said
today.
   The young man, Benjamin N. Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., and
his companion, Laura Bachman, 19, of Bethesda, Md., pleaded
innocent to charges of unlawful entry onto Rowan's property in
northwest Washington.
   The U.S. attorney's office said it was referring to District of
Columbia authorities the decision whether to bring weapons charges
against the columnist.
   Rowan, asked to comment on the day's developments, told a
reporter:
   ``I am not saying one word about that decision. I think I've
been very generous in talking to the media, and I've said all I'm
going to say.''
   A city police investigation of the June 14 incident revealed
that .22-caliber handgun Rowan used was not registered with the
District of Columbia.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said in a statement that while his
office believes Rowan should be charged with possession of an
unregistered firearm, the city traditionally prosecutes such
charges.
   Rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son,
Carl T. Rowan Jr., a former FBI agent. Rowan maintained that his
son had been told by city officials he did not need to register the
weapon when he left the FBI. The district's far-reaching 1976
handgun ordinance says that all weapons must be registered.
   If Rowan is charged with possession of an unregistered handgun
and ammunition, he could face penalties on each charge of up to a
year in prison and a fine of up to $1,000.
   Smith and Bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in prison
and a $400 fine on the misdemeanor charges. District of Columbia
Hearing Commissioner J. Dennis Doyle set a trial date of Aug. 18.
The two had been charged with illegal entry shortly after the
incident, but those charges were withdrawn within hours.
   The statement from the U.S. attorney's office said investigators
had found ``insufficient evidence'' to file an assault charge
against Rowan.
   Rowan has said he called police after hearing noises in his
backyard, investigating and finding four people in his pool.
   The columnist said he fired at Smith after the young man lunged
at him. Smith disputes that, saying he was trying to flee when he
was shot.
   Wounded in the hand, Smith was treated and released from a local
hospital.

<TEXT>
   A congressional candidate endorsed by the
Democratic Party said Thursday he is a homosexual and hopes his
acknowledgement will allow him to concentrate on more important
issues.
   ``Some people say, `Do you want to be honest or get elected?' I
think I can do both,'' said Michael Gelpi, who is running in the
12th District.
   Officials from the Franklin County Democratic Party and Gelpi's
campaign said reaction was mild.
   ``We were prepared for lots of phone calls, and the phone calls
that we have had ... have been very postive and very supportive,''
said Karen Zoeller, Gelpi's campaign manager.
   Gelpi, a 47-year-old businessman, is running as an independent
for the seat held by Rep. John Kasich, a Republican seeking his
fourth term from the central Ohio district, which includes part of
Columbus. Gelpi won the endorsement of the Democratic Party after
it determined that Michael P. Brown, who ran unopposed in the
Democratic primary, is a supporter of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   His acknowledgement of his sexual orientation came in a news
release.
   ``I say that my status as a gay person doesn't have anything to
do with this campaign,'' the statement said. ``This campaign is
about issues. It is about the fact that I will do a better job of
representing my constituents than John Kasich _ a much better job.''
   Kasich's Washington office declined comment.
   Gelpi said the issues he feels are important in the campaign
include fighting drug abuse, and improving education and the
economy.

<HEAD>Central Committee May Get New Members, Agenda Not Clear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's Communist Party conference may name
new members to the policy-setting Central Committee, but it will
stick to the old practice of closing the door on most of its
debates, an official said Thursday.
   Yuri A. Sklyarov of the Central Committee's Propaganda
Department said the conference, opening Tuesday, could name new
members to the 300-plus member party body that formulates policy
and signs off on key personnel changes between the party
congresses, which normally are held every five years.
   But he did not say definitely that there would be new members to
replace so-called ``dead souls'' _ 60 to 70 members who have died
or lost the jobs that entitled them to Central Committee seats
since the last party congress in 1986.
   For many months after Gorbachev announced in January 1987 that
he would hold the first party conference since 1941, Soviet
officials and journalists predicted it would make sweeping changes
in the Central Committee to give the Kremlin leader a body strongly
backing his reforms.
   The strength of conservatives who are braking change appears to
have scaled down the expectations of a sweeping personnel shakeup
and radical reforms.
   Many Moscow intellectuals now say they expect the conference to
be more of a dress rehearsal for a pro-reform congress in 1991,
saying Gorbachev may have learned from this experience how to do to
avoid conservative maneuvering to dominate delegate slates.
   Sklyarov said Thursday that live television coverage of the
conference will be limited to a broadcast of the opening session,
where Gorbachev will set the tone with a report on the present and
future pace of reform, and a report on the closing session.
   Delegate speeches will be summarized on TV and printed in full
in newspapers once the speakers themselves have had a chance to
approve the text, Sklyarov said.
   The arrangements are almost identical to those for the February
1986 congress and seem certain to disappoint the most outspoken
reformers who had demanded live TV coverage of the entire meeting
as a way of making the Communist Party more accountable to the
people it rules.
   Strengthening political accountability and the legal system are
two declared goals of the 30-page conference proposals, known as
theses, which have been fiercely debated in the media and at party
meetings since being approved by the Central Committee May 23.
   The theses contain proposals that could dismantle the vestiges
of Stalinism, but are vaguely worded in a possible attempt to fend
off conservatives.
   Sklyarov said hundreds of thousands of suggestions based on the
theses have poured into the Central Committee, which is collating
them for presentation to the agenda-setting presidium of the
conference.
   He declined to specify, however, who is collating the proposals
and exactly how the presidium will be selected.
   Georgian Communist Party head Dzhumber Patiashvili said
important representatives of each conference delegation will huddle
after all 5,000 arrive in Moscow on Sunday.
   Those discussions are likely to remain secret. Ivan D. Laptev,
chief editor of the government newspaper Izvestia, said his daily
would publish details only if they were interesting.
   Yegor Yakovlev, a delegate and editor of the pro-reform weekly
Moscow News, said Wednesday about 70 delegates will take the floor
during the conference, which Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov has
said will last through July 1.
   But Sklyarov and other officials refused to confirm that
timetable, suggesting the duration and agenda of the conference are
still open.
   Patiashvili said the 106-member Georgian delegation is still
meeting in his republic to decide its platform at the conference.
   He said he had not read the radical platforms published by the
Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia, which demanded a form of
home rule. Georgia's demands will not be published as a program, he
said, but may contain a few similar proposals for more autonomy
from Moscow.
   Party congresses theoretically are the supreme organ of the
party, usually meeting every five years to name members of the
Central Committee and formulate policy. Party conferences, which
were held infrequently before 1941 but have not been convened since
then, are convened to take up special proposals.

<HEAD>Ceremonies Commemorate Anniversary Of Berlin Airlift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1944 cargo plane hauled ambassadors instead of
food supplies Thursday to mark the 40th anniversary of the Berlin
Airlift, the massive Allied effort that broke a Soviet blockade of
West Berlin.
   ``The Berlin Airlift changed this city, and it changed the
world,'' said U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt, who spoke at West
Berlin's Templehof Airport after arriving from Frankfurt Thursday
afternoon on the DC-3 plane, a civilian version of the military
C-47 transports used during the airlift.
   In June 1948, the Soviet Union sealed off Allied road, rail and
canal access to western sectors of Berlin, an enclave 110 miles
inside what was then Soviet-held territory and is now Communist
East Germany.
   During the airlift's 15 months, U.S. and British cargo planes
ferried more than 1.8 million tons of food, coal and other vital
supplies to 2 million hungry people in the Allied-controlled
sectors of Berlin.
   The planes that delivered the supplies came to be known as
``Raisin Bombers'' because they frequently dropped raisins and
candy to the children of Berlin.
   ``Everything was in short supply _ food, clothing, everything.
There was nothing left over from day to day,'' recalled Helga
Galler, 60, of West Berlin, one of 400 people waiting at Templehof
for the plane to land.
   ``So when we saw these planes coming _ these `Raisin Bombers' _
we knew we didn't have to worry any longer,'' she said.
   Accompanying Burt were British Ambassador Sir Christopher
Mallaby, French Ambassador Serge Boidevaix, West German Defense
Minister Rupert Scholz, and retired Air Force Col. Gail Halvorsen,
an original airlift pilot.
   Earlier Thursday, the ambassadors attended the opening of an
airlift exhibit in Bonn and ceremonies at the U.S. Rhine Main Air
Base near Frankfurt. Many of the Berlin Airlift flights orignated
at Rhine Main.
   The airlift began on June 26, 1948, and by the time it ended on
Sept. 30, 1949, more than 277,000 planeloads of food and supplies
were brought into the former German capital.
   Bitter disputes between the Kremlin and the three other
victorious World War II Allies led to the Soviets move to cut
Berlin off from the West.
   Soviet leader Josef Stalin staunchly opposed creation of a
unified German state in the three Western occupation zones. When
the Allies backed a currecy reform to speed up economic recovery of
war-torn Germany, Moscow imposed the blockade.
   Four days after the money reform on June 20, the Soviets blocked
all roads, waterways and railway lines.
   In response, U.S. Army Gen. Lucius D. Clay, the military
governor of the American zone of conquered Germany, ordered all
cargo planes available to deliver provisions.
   The Soviets ended the blockade May 12, 1949, but the Western
allies continued the flights until land, waterway and rail traffic
had resumed. The airlift cost $200 million.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Australia Caught in Trans-Atlantic Trade War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke charged
Thursday that his country's farmers are falling victim to a
trans-Atlantic trade war, but President Reagan pledged to watch out
for Australia's interests while combating European agricultural
subsidies.
   Hawke, addressing a joint meeting of Congress, said Australia's
producers are finding themselves ``squeezed out of markets by
practices which distort prices and levels of production.''
   As a result, he said, the U.S. share of the world wheat market
has climbed from 29 percent to 43 percent while Australia's slumped
from 20 percent to 12 percent.
   ``Australia must not be given to believe that while we are
first-class allies, we are, in trade, second-class friends,'' Hawke
said.
   ``We believe our relationship entitles us to a fair go in our
trade with the United States and in competition with the United
States in third markets,'' he added. ``Not, I emphasize, special
favors, but a fair go.''
   ``In agriculture we find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a
destructive and counter-productive trans-Atlantic subsidies war,''
Hawke said.
   Reagan, after meeting with Hawke at the White House, said:
``We're in full agreement on the need to open up international
trade in agricultural products, a keystone of both our economies.
We also agree on the need to redouble our efforts toward the
elimination of trade distorting government subsidies of
agricultural products.''
   ``Until we achieve that goal,'' he added, ``we will assure that
any measures the United States may take to counter unfair
subsidization of agriculture will take fully into account the
interests of countries like Australia.''
   Gaston J. Sigur, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said Reagan and Hawke ``discussed Australian
concerns about U.S. agricultural trade policies'' and ``the
president reassured the prime minister that it is not our purpose
to damage the interests of non-subsidized agricultural producers
such as Australia.''
   In answer to a question, Sigur said Reagan ``didn't make any
very specific commitments as such,'' but merely reiterated the
commitment that he made to Hawke on the issue during their last
meeting in 1986.
   ``They are still concerned, but we feel that we have handled
their concerns very well,'' he said. ``The president assured the
prime minister that we were going to continue ... to watch very
carefully the Australian export situation and that we would not do
anything, as we believe we have not done anything in the past, to
harm Australian markets.''
   The State Department official said Hawke ``appreciated the
president's remarks on this'' but said he ``wanted to be sure that
we were always watching.'' The prime minister did not allude to
Reagan's pledge in his remarks at a departure ceremony.
   Sigur said the president reported to Hawke on the seven-nation
economic summit in Toronto, from which he returned on Tuesday.
Reagan sought with little success at the summit to secure European
support for his campaign to end agricultural subsidies by the year
2000.
   Reagan also told Hawke that Australia is an important ally in
arms-reduction negotiations. Hawke said his talk with the president
confirmed ``the strength and enduring nature'' of the relationship
between the United States and Australia.
   The president called attention to the facilities the two
countries share in Australia and said they ``are essential to
deterrence and to the west's ability to monitor Soviet compliance
with arms accords.''
   In his address to Congress, Hawke made clear that Australia has
no intention of following the lead of its neighbor, New Zealand, in
barring U.S. warships carrying nuclear weapons from its waters.
   ``The United States has every right to see alliances as a
two-way street, to expect that allies will carry their weight,'' he
said. ``I assure you that Australia is and will remain such an
ally.''
   ``We welcome your ships and aircraft to our ports and
airfields.''

   Mischievous Israeli children and Jewish
settlers seeking retaliation set some of the blazes that have
scorched thousands of acres of land since May, Israeli officials
and Palestinian landowners said Thursday.
   Arab arsonists destroyed most of the 35,000 acres of greenery
torched since this spring. Underground Arab leaders called an
``Arson Day'' on Wednesday, and nine of the 14 fires which broke
out apparently were set by Palestinians, police said.
   But a rarely mentioned fact is that Israelis are responsible for
some of the blazes, despite the importance the Jewish state places
on cultivating the land.
   Settlers living in the occupied West Bank burned more than 400
acres of wheat crops and olive trees in the past month on
Arab-owned land near the city of Nablus, according to Palestinian
farmers.
   They said the settlers appeared to be acting in retaliation for
attacks by Arabs during the 6{-month uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Arab farmers' complaints were backed by the daily Haaretz,
which reported settlers were suspected of setting at least eight
recent fires in the West Bank. Israeli police officials in the West
Bank said they could not confirm the reports.
   In addition, some recent fires in Israel were set by Jewish
children who acted ``just for the fun of it,'' Police Minister
Chaim Bar-Lev said on Israel radio.
   Three 9-year-old Jewish boys were caught this week starting a
fire in a field near the Mediterranean coastal city of Tel Aviv,
said Bar-Lev's spokesman Nahum Mendel. Bar-Lev said the three were
simply mischievous, but Mendel declined to elaborate.
   Israeli soldiers are a third group which causes some fires.
Troops sometimes unwittingly ignite fields and trees by gunfire or
flares during target practice or border combat, Galilee Fire Chief
Danny Hanania told The Associated Press.
   In fact, one of the worst blazes Wednesday was caused by
soldiers who shot flares in a grove of avocado trees as they chased
a squad of Palestinian guerrillas near the Lebanese border, Hanania
said.
   He said training accidents were the cause of dozens of fires in
northern Israel in recent months, but he declined to be more
specific. The army routinely refuses to comment on damage or
casualties caused during military training.
   Most of the fires set since May were inside pre-1967 Israel. But
Palestinians in the West Bank also have been victims.
   Farmer Mohammed Amran of Burein village near Nablus said he saw
2{ acres of his wheat crop go up in flames on June 6 after men
wearing Jewish skullcaps parked a van by his field.
   ``I saw three settlers park near my land. Shortly afterward I
saw the field engulfed in smoke,'' Amran said.
   In another case, two shepherds employed by Abdel Moati Silwada
of Rash Rash village near Nablus said they saw two gun-toting
Jewish settlers set a fire that razed 2{ acres of fig and olive
groves on June 13.
   Attorney Muna Rishmawi of Law in the Service of Man, an Arab
affiliate of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists,
said details of such cases were being gathered for publication.

<HEAD>GAO To Look at Perot's Postal Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate-ordered investigation may delay
completion of a study by billionaire businessman H. Ross Perot to
find ways of saving money at the Postal Service.
   The Senate has requested the General Accounting Office to
investigate terms of the deal, and directed the Postal Service to
delay phase two of the contract.
   Postal officials, meanwhile, defended the deal Thursday and said
they welcomed the investigation.
   ``Although we are aware that adverse statements about the
contacrt are emanating from would-be competitors of Mr. Perot _ and
are presenting a distorted view of this opportunity to bring his
vast business experience to bear on resolving some of our problems
_ we believe this contract is an appropriate step that is
consistent with our ongoing efforts to prepare the Postal Service
for the future,'' the agency said in a statement.
   The $500,000 deal, calling for computer specialist Perot to
analyze postal operations and recommend cost-saving changes, was
announced June 2. It was to last for 90 days, and be followed by a
second phase in which Perot would be paid a percentage of any
savings the service realized from implementing his recommendations.
   ``It's a beautiful arrangement for Perot, but not so pretty for
the postal customers,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``The Postal
Service will pay the costs for the first phase, then the Perot
company gets a cut of the savings, if phase two is successful.''
   Also critical of the the deal, which was not opened to
competitive bids, were Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Charles E.
Grassley, R-Iowa.
   The Senate resolution called on the GAO to look into the
contract and report back within 45 days. It also called on the
Postal Service to delay implementation of any second phase of the
contract for a further 45 days to give the Senate time to study the
GAO report.
   Thus, if the study suggests changes in postal operations,
implementation could be delayed by a month or so.

<HEAD>South Bronx Herb Farm Bites the Dust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A greenhouse that provided herbs from the urban
jungle for plates in posh restaurants has gone bankrupt after seven
years.
   The demise of Glie Farms, known officially as South Bronx
Greenhouse, put more than 80 residents of the blighted South Bronx
neighborhood out of work.
   ``They're no longer there. Their jobs have disappeared,'' said
Allen Morrison, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, which runs the Bathgate Industrial Park, where the herb
farm once thrived.
   This week, the Sanitation Department removed rows of unkempt
herbs after neighbors complained of the rotting smell. But the
empty greenhouses still may see future harvests.
   ``Something will be grown at Bathgate in their wake; we're
optimistic,'' Morrison said Thursday.
   Glie Farms was founded in 1981, with the help of a federal
grant, as a non-profit venture to provide jobs for runaway youths.
After several years, it became a for-profit venture, building up a
clientele of 800 restaurants and 15 supermarket chains and grossing
as much as $250,000 a month.
   ``Glie Farms was a real Cinderella story,'' said Bob Menge, the
purchasing director for the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan.
``But that's the food business. You see so many companies come and
go.''
   Glie founder Gary Waldron said his principal problem had been
difficulty in securing a $1.5 million loan that he negotiated last
year to start a farm in Puerto Rico. The company filed for
bankruptcy a few weeks ago.

   Mud and rock loosened by rain roared down
on a mountain village and highway Thursday, burying up to 100
people, including 30 travelers stranded in a coffee house by an
earlier landslide, officials said.
   State television said villagers reported hearing people cry out
for help from beneath the ooze and rubble.
   ``It happened all at once after a noise that sounded like
thunder. The rocks swept away everything in a second,'' said Turan
Alemdar, a trucker who saw the disaster, as quoted by the Hurriyet
News Agency.
   Another witness, Zeki Ilha, was quoted as saying: ``I saw the
mountain coming at me and started running away.''
   Rescuers were hampered by rain. Another landslide at 8 p.m.
forced a suspension of the rescue work, but caused no casualties,
the television reported from Catak village, 500 miles northeast of
Ankara near the Black Sea.
   The Black Sea region is known for frequent landslides, some of
which are blamed on extensive cutting of forests.
   Enver Hizlan, the provincial governor, said only one body had
been recovered. Earlier reports said three were found.
   Deputy Gov. Haydar Ozgun told The Associated Press by telephone
the rescue work would resume when landslide experts declared it
safe. The Anatolia news agency said huge searchlights were set up.
   Safa Giray, federal public works minister, flew to the site.
   State radio said 31 people were injured by the landslide in a
mountainous area of Trabzon province.
   Tons of mud and rock covered at least three houses, four stores,
a restaurant and the coffee house crowded with at least 30 bus
passengers stranded by an earlier landslide, the news agencies
reported. A high school also was buried but no children were there
because of summer vacation.
   Several buses and cars were on the road when the landslide hit,
Anatolia reported. Television said it also clogged a river, which
flooded the village, and showed footage of submerged houses.
   Anatolia quoted a supervising official, not identified, as
saying rescuers might need two weeks to clear the debris if the
rain continued. It said 40 trucks and 20 bulldozers were at the
scene.
   Two minibuses were uncovered but no one was inside, the news
reports said.
   Turkey's Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross,
sent 150 tents to the area, Antatolia said.
   A dispatch by Hurriyet said the Red Crescent announced over
loudspeakers at scene that 300 people had been killed, causing a
temporary panic. Officials at the scene and elsewhere estimated the
number buried at 100 or fewer.

<HEAD>House Keeps Family Provision in Housing Discrimination Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday refused to kill a
proposal barring discrimination in housing for families with
children.
   The House rejected on a vote of 289-116 an amendment proposed by
Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., that would have stripped the protection for
families with children from legislation designed to strengthen the
enforcement of the nation's fair housing law.
   Under the bill, families with children under 18 could not be
refused housing except in retirement communities where at least 90
percent of the tenants are 55 or older and the facilities are
specifically designed for the physical or social needs of retirees.
Any community renting to those 62 or older would be exempt even if
it did not provide special facilities.
   Final action on the bill was delayed as the House recessed for
the day to attend the funeral services of Rep. John J. Duncan,
R-Tenn., in Knoxville. The bill is expected to be taken up again
late next week.
   Senate leaders have said they would take up the bill after the
House approves it, indicating that the legislation may go to the
White House before the end of summer.
   Civil rights groups and Realtors earlier this week ended a
20-year battle by reaching a compromise to put teeth in the basic
fair-housing law while still satisfying President Reagan's concerns
about constitutional guarantees.
   The bill would give the Department of Housing and Urban
Development the power to bring actions on behalf of individual
victims of discrimination, would ban discrimination against the
disabled and would forbid limitations on renting to families with
children, except in the clearly defined retirement communities.
   Under the compromise, HUD would be required to investigate
complaints of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. And
it would be authorized to lodge charges if it finds ``reasonable
cause'' to believe that discrimination may have occurred.
   At that point, there would be an administrative proceeding
unless either the plaintiff or the defendant requests a jury trial;
either proceeding could lead to imposition of fines or injunctions
and could be appealed to a higher court.
   The compromise language which gives the accused the right to a
civil trial by jury was introduced by Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr.,
R-N.Y., and was passed by the House 401-0.
   The House also passed by voice vote an amendment by Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., which would permit the exclusion of an individual
who threatens the safety of others and one by Rep. Robert S.
Walker, R-Pa., to take away protection of the law from anyone
convicted of drug manufacturing.
   The Shaw amendment would have eliminated the provisions of the
bill extending protection from housing discrimination to families
with children under the age of 18. It would have required the Civil
Rights Commission to conduct a study on the nature and extent of
housing discrimination against familes with children and report to
Congress within three years.

<HEAD>Kremlin Launches New Grain Push</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has sharply raised the bonuses it
pays to farms for grain in a major new effort to stimulate
production and cut imports, Tass reported Thursday.
   The decision by the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee and the government's Council of Ministers, the Cabinet,
reflects the hard push Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is making
to invigorate the sluggish Soviet economy.
   The new drive to breathe life into Soviet agriculture comes at
an important time politically for Gorbachev: just days before the
Communist Party holds a conference to review progress in the three
years of his program of perestroika, or restructuring. About 5,000
delegates from around the country are to convene the meeting in
Moscow on Tuesday.
   Bonuses for grain production were introduced last year.
Gorbachev, a former Central Committee agriculture secretary,
apparently believed the time was ripe to increase the incentives.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the sharp increases in
bonuses were aimed primarily at stimulating production of
high-quality grains.
   ``The noted bonuses are paid out when the quality of production
meets the demands of state standards,'' the report said.
   The bonus for durum wheat was raised to 150 percent. Tass did
not say what the earlier level was. This means that if any farm
produces more durum wheat than the state orders, any surplus is
bought for the regular price plus 150 percent of that price.
Bonuses were also raised for increased production of other grain
products.
   The new bonuses are to take effect July 1, but one Western
diplomat familiar with Soviet agriculture said he doubts there will
be any quick results.
   ``It's like telling a football team at the end of the third
quarter that if you win the game, you'll get a $5,000 bonus instead
of a $2,000 bonus. It just comes too late,'' said the diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Soviet grain production has consistently fallen below targeted
levels, and this has forced the country to make large imports. Last
year's harvest was 211.4 million tons. This was an improvement
since larger shortfalls in previous years. The United States
Agriculture Department estimates Soviet grain production this year
will amount to 215 million tons. The targeted level is 235 million
tons.
   Under an agreement with the United States, the Soviet Union must
buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually.

<HEAD>Strikers Assault Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking autoworkers demanding a 50
percent pay increase assaulted the mayor of the Slovenian city of
Maribor on Thursday as he tried to calm them down, the official
Tanjug news agency said.
   Tanjug said the workers were angred by a report that most of the
strikers from the TAM truck and military vehicle factory had
returned to work, and Mayor Ivan Cuk tried to soothe them.
   ``Instead, he hardly managed to escape an assault of several
angry persons,'' Tanjug said, without elaborating.
   The incident took place in the northern Yugoslav city when
strikers reportedly refused to accept a proposed 7.5 percent pay
increase. A company spokesman said Thursday that about 4,000 of the
employees had returned to work.
   Tanjug said that 1,500 TAM workers were joined by 3,000 workers
from three other plants and marched to the center of the city.
   It added that the workers began dispersing around noon. Sources
said police blocked off one downtown street, but no arrests were
made.
   The 5,000 employees of TAM went on strike Tuesday seeking higher
wages. Several hundred workers from four other plants in the
Slovenian city joined the walkout in the first such show of
solidarity reported in Yugoslavia.
   The Belgrade daily Politika said as many as 7,500 workers were
involved.
   The strikers claim their wages threaten minimum standards of
living.
   Yugoslavia is planning to reduce inflation to 90 percent this
year, compared with an average 170 percent last year.
   Yugoslavia's economy, a mixture of free-market elements and
Soviet-style central planning, has been growing at a sluggish rate
averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years.
   The government on Saturday launched an austerity program that
   included substantial price increases, wage cuts of up to 30
percent and a 23.9 percent devaluation of the dinar, the national
currency.

<HEAD>House Ethics Panel to Probe Congressman in Loan Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee announced Thursday
it is launching a formal preliminary investigation into whether
Rep. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., violated the law or House rules in
seeking a loan that he knew was being financed by drug proceeds.
   The panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, said it had recieved evidence ``reasonably
indicating'' that Swindall may have departed from acceptable
standards in seeking to negotiate the $850,000 loan.
   Secretly taped conversations reported last week by the Atlanta
Constitution showed that Swindall was advised by an undercover
agent that the money almost certainly came from drug trafficking,
but he continued to pursue the transaction for a month.
   The two-term congressman was seeking to refinance a construction
loan on his $1.2 million home in Stone Mountain, Ga., near Atlanta,
and convert it to a long-term mortgage.
   An aide to Swindall, Bill Thorne, said the ethics committee had
``done what we asked them to do.'' He said Swindall had sought the
investigation and was confident he would be cleared of wrongdoing.
   Swindall was on his way back to Georgia for the weekend and
unavailable for comment, Thorne said.
   A preliminary inquiry is the first step in an ethics committee
investigation. If the panel finds reason to believe that the
alleged violation in fact occurred, it makes a formal statement of
the violation and can ultimately recommend disciplinary action.
   Swindall ultimately backed out of the deal after being told he
would have to accept the cash loan in person and sign a receipt for
it.
   ``The only reason I can't do that is I would then be essentially
laundering y'all's money,'' Swindall told an Internal Revenue
Service undercover agent, according to the Constitution.
   ``In other words, if Charles (LeChasney, who has subsequently
been indicted on money-laundering charges) wants to launder y'all's
money, fine, but I can't do that, and to sign a receipt of cash
would be to do that.''
   Swindall, at a town meeting in his congressional district last
week, apologized for his behavior and asked voters to forgive him.
   ``I did entertain the idea, and it was wrong,'' Swindall said.
But he said he had no intention of resigning, and ``I hope (voters)
will find it in their hearts to forgive what I have done.''
   Swindall, who faces a tough re-election battle this fall, said
he was tempted to accept the loan because of financial pressures
stemming from cost overruns on the large new house he was building.
   But he said he backed away when he became convinced the
transaction was illicit.
   ``When it was between myself and my maker, I made the right
decision,'' he said.

   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers, took a lot of heat in the months
after the stock market crash for seeing the world through
rose-colored glasses and predicting strong, steady economic growth
this year.
   Many private economists had issued deeply pessimistic
projections, fearing that the Oct. 19 market collapse, when
investors lost $500 billion in a single day, would shock consumers
into cutting back and topple the country into a recession.
   But the actual performance of the economy as measured by the
gross national product _ 4.8 percent annual growth in the fourth
quarter of 1987 and 3.6 percent growth in the first three months of
this year _ made even the White House estimates look too gloomy.
   ``Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough. The economy is doing
better than even we expected,'' a smiling, confident Sprinkel told
reporters at a White House briefing Thursday.
   He said the administration now expects the economy to grow 3.5
percent, year-over-year, in 1988, compared with an earlier
projection of 2.9 percent. The forecast of average unemployment is
moving from 5.8 percent to 5.5 percent
   And despite fears of inflation by stock and bond traders, he
said he's holding steady on his prediction for consumer price
inflation of 4.3 percent and expects only an average increase in
interest rates of half a percentage point.
   President Reagan, responding to a reporter's question at a
picture-taking session, said he's not worried about inflation
either.
   ``All the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and,
no, there is no great threat of inflation,'' the president said.
   Private analysts found little fault with the administration's
new growth estimate, but they said its optimistic view of inflation
fails to take into account the potentially devastating effect on
food prices of the drought scorching crops in the nation's
midsection.
   ``He's certainly right about better growth ... but the rest is
just pie in the sky stuff,'' said Michael K. Evans, an economic
consultant in Washington.
   Sprinkel conceded the drought could have ``a significant effect
on food prices,'' but said it is too soon to say how significant.
   ``We cannot guess because I don't know whether it's going to
rain. I hope soon,'' Sprinkel said
   But the National Weather Service said Thursday that the
six-to-10-day outlook for the Midwest and Great Plains calls for
more hot, dry weather.
   Sprinkel noted, however, that the farm community generates only
about 2 percent of the gross national product.
   David Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer, said, ``I think almost everyone is
underestimating how devastating the drought can be to food
prices.'' He noted that food makes up about one-fifth the consumer
price index.
   ``I think the shading of the administration's estimates on
inflation may involve at least some election year politics in
addition to economic analysis,'' he said. ``I think what the
administration is trying to do is present a picture of strong
economic growth and low inflation as we come into an election.''
   But Sprinkel said, ``Our economy is not overheating, as
sometimes feared.'' He said the administration bases its inflation
predictions on the expectation that economic growth will slow
somewhat in the remaining nine months of they year from the
first-quarter pace.
   He said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being
revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988
and the stronger-than-expected growth experienced during 1987. For
1989, the administration expects the economy to grow 3.1 percent.
   ``For those of you who are always trying to figure out what we
are thinking, it means we envision some decline in interest rates
later this year,'' he said.

   Iraq said its warplanes bombed 10 Iranian
oil installations Thursday in the heaviest air raids on Tehran's
economic backbone in weeks.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said six production installations
in the Ahwaz oilfields in southwestern Khuzestan province were set
on fire.
   Later, two installations at the Bibi Hakimah oilfield, 120 miles
to the southeast, were bombed and set ablaze, INA said. The report
was monitored in Nicosia.
   Another formation of jets hit two pumping stations at the Gash
Saran field north of Bibi Hakimah at about the same time, leaving
them shrouded in flames and smoke, the agency said.
   INA said its jet fighters flew 113 missions and its helicopter
gunships 30 missions and all returned safely to their bases.
   There was no independent confirmation of the Iraqi claims. But
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Cyprus, reported that Iraqi jets bombed ``a residential area and
labor quarters'' in the Ahvaz area, killing one civilian.
   The agency said other unspecified areas also were bombed. But it
made no mention of oil installations being hit.
   INA denied residential areas were hit, saying the bombing ``was
confined to striking installations at oilfields and Iranian
military positions.''
   INA quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a
message to Tehran that ``it has lost the war in all fields and that
there is no alternative to save Iran from total deterioration but
to accept peace.''
   Thursday's raids were the first significant attacks on Iran's
vital oil installations on land since early May, when
fighter-bombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical
plants.
   The air force also has attacked several Iranian oil tankers in
the Persian Gulf in its campaign to choke off Iran's oil exports
which Tehran needs to pay for its war effort.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   French-built Iraqi Mirage F-1s carried out a long-range
1,500-mile raid on Iran's Larak Island oil terminal in the Strait
of Hormuz May 14.
   Five tankers were set on fire. They included the world's largest
vessel, the 564,739-ton Seawise Giant, which was badly damaged.
   The Iraqi air offensive inflicted considerable damage on Iran's
oil infrastructure in March and April, oil industry and diplomatic
sources reported. Refineries were repeatedly hit.
   Oil industry sources have reported that Iran has been forced to
import unprecedented amounts of refined products, such as aviation
fuel and kerosene, because its refinery production has been badly
reduced.
   Despite the Iraqi raids, Iran has maintained its oil production
at around an average of 2.3 million barrels a day, with exports of
around 1.4 million barrels a day, the respected Middle East
Economic Survey reported.
   That's about the mimimum level Iran needs to maintain to earn
sufficient revenue to keep its war effort going. Oil revenue
accounts for some 95 percent of Iran's foreign exchange earnings.
   Oil sales earned $20 billion a year in 1983, but plummeted to
only around $6 billion in 1986 when oil prices collapsed.
   The Iranians have suffered two major battlefield defeats in
recent weeks, which along with political in-fighting in Tehran and
economic woes, have pushed them on the defensive for the first time
in several years.
   Iraq's air force has been concentrating on attacking Iranian
troop buildups in the past few weeks as the land war heated up,
with the Iraqi Army abandoning its long-held strategy of static
defense to go on the offensive for the first time in six years.

<HEAD>High-Rise Apartments Planned for Black Township</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company said Thursday it
plans to build the first high-rise apartment complex in Soweto, the
vast black township where tens of thousands of people live in
shacks because of a housing shortage.
   The project envisions 40,000 people would be able to live in
7,000 to 8,000 apartments in buildings up to 25 stories. Two dozen
schools will be built in six three-story buildings nearby,
according to the $230 million plan by the non-profit Foundation for
Community Development.
   The highest building in Soweto, where an estimated 2.5 million
people live on 40 square miles of low hills, is now a 10-story
nurses' dormitory.
   Aside from a few two-story houses in higher-income
neighborhoods, Sowetans live on small lots in one-story houses.
Many have outside toilets and no bathrooms.
   Most homes now have running water and electricity, but
squatters, relatives and friends of householders live by the
thousands in shacks, sheds and garages.
   There are relatively few apartment buildings for blacks anywhere
in South Africa.
   The proposed Soweto complex would house 40,000 people where two
hostels previously accommodated 4,000.
   The non-profit foundation said a studio apartment in the new
complex would be sold rather than rented and would cost about
$6,000. It said that compared to an average $6,500 for a serviced
plot of land without a house in a township.
   South Africa's apartheid laws require blacks to live in
segregated townships, most of them relatively far from urban
centers where they work. Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs and have separate schools
and health services.
   Anti-apartheid activists accuse of the government of restricting
the available land for black housing to control the numbers of
blacks in urban areas. One result has been massive squatter camps.
   The government recently announced a plan to add vacant land to
the black townships around Johannesburg for more black housing. One
proposed community north of Johannesburg may be designated as an
area where people of any race could live.

   Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., on Thursday labeled as
``absolutely untrue'' and ``politically motivated'' a newspaper
report that the FBI had Dyson's aide under surveillance last month
when the aide committed suicide by jumping from a New York hotel.
   ``There is absolutely no basis in fact to these reports. I've
never been contacted by any investigators, no one in my office has
been contacted, none of my friends has been contacted,'' Dyson said
in an interview.
   The New York Post, quoting unnamed law enforcement officials,
said FBI agents were watching the hotel as part of an investigation
of alleged Pentagon fraud and bribery.
   The newspaper quoted the sources as saying the FBI was
monitoring the trip because the event was financed by Unisys, a
defense contractor. The aide, Tom Pappas, committed suicide by
jumping from a hotel window in midtown Manhattan on May 1.
   Dyson, a member of the House Armed Services procurement
subcommittee, is one of five House members whose names had been
linked to the Pentagon investigation in the past week.
   But on Wednesday, Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney in charge of
the case, told House leaders that no congressmen are targets of the
widespread investigation. House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said
he had been assured that no congressmen are among the targets.
   ``The speaker said yesterday and the U.S. attorney said
yesterday that no member of Congress is a target,'' Dyson noted.
``I just have to assume that if somebody's leaking this stuff, it's
politically motivated and they're just trying to focus attention
away from the Pentagon and onto Capitol Hill.''
   ``I can't tell exactly who's behind it, but if these kind of
leaks come about and there's no foundation for it, I would have to
assume it's partisan. It would have be Republicans,'' he said.
   ``This is absolutely untrue, unfounded and I don't think it's
honorable of people in the executive branch to leak this kind of
stuff,'' Dyson said.

   The Television Hall of Fame will induct eight
new members this fall, including two of TV's most famous teams,
Burns and Allen and Huntley and Brinkley, it was announced Thursday.
   The inductees include four comedians, two newsmen and two
producers, who will be inducted Nov. 19 in a two-hour special to be
telecast on Fox Broadcasting Co. on Nov. 28.
   They are: Jack Benny, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Chet
Huntley and David Brinkley, Red Skelton, David Susskind and David
Wolper.
   The Hall of Fame was established five years ago by the Academy
of Television Arts & Sciences.
   Comedians Burns and Allen were on radio and television for many
years. Huntley and Brinkley were television's top news team in the
1950s and 1960s.
   Benny and Skelton were popular comedians, and producers Susskind
and Wolper were responsible for some of television's most memorable
programs.
   Burns, Brinkley, Skelton and Wolper are expected to be at the
ceremonies. The others will be honored posthumously.

<TEXT>
   The annual Festival of Two Worlds opened
Thursday night in the medieval hilltown of Spoleto, amid
projections the event would surpass last year's attendance figures.
   The Joffrey Ballet, the renowned U.S. dance company, kicked off
the 18-day program with an Italian premiere of ``Light Rain,''
followed by Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' the prototype of
modern dance first performed in 1913.
   Among the highlights of the 1988 festival will be Polish-born
director Roman Polanski's presentation of Franz Kafka's surrealist
``Metamorphosis,'' and a new tragedy by Italian playwright Mario
Missiroli. Missiroli's work explores the relationship between
Italy's fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Clara
Petacci, in the setting of the country's fascist upheaval of the
1930s and 1940s.
   The festival includes three operas, five ballets, 11 plays and
47 concerts, in addition to art exhibits and film showings.
   Ticket sales have so far outpaced last year's advance sales,
according to a festival spokesman, who added that most of the
performances for the first five days have been sold out.
   Organizers said Thursday they are optimistic this year's
attendance will exceed the 1987 levels of more than 100,000
visitors, despite a production schedule containing 60 fewer
performances than last year.
   Last year the festival earned $650,000 from ticket sales, far
short of the $4 million in costs.
   Gian Carlo Menotti, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and
founder of the festival, chose the ancient setting of Spoleto in
1957 with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of Europe and
America. In 1977 he took the festival to Charleston, S.C., and in
1986 he expanded the project to Melbourne, Australia.
   Menotti retains a dominant role in all of the festival's
artistic and organizational aspects.
   This year's festival runs through July 10.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Mistrial In Newman's Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newman's Own remains Paul Newman's own
for now as the lawsuit against the blue-eyed star who also operates
Salad King got temporarily tossed Thursday.
   Bridgeport Superior Court Judge Howard Zoarski declared a
mistrial in the case of a delicatessen owner seeking some profits
from the actor's food enterprises, but the plaintiff said he will
sue again.
   The judge decided on the mistrial after jurors said they were
unable to ignore depositions that were inadvertently turned over to
them Wednesday. The papers had not been admitted as evidence.
   He reversed a ruling he made a few minutes earlier when he
instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from Westport
deli owner Julius Gold and others involved in the case.
   A note delivered to the judge just before noon said, ``Some
members do not feel an unbiased opinion can be rendered in light of
their reading of an amount of the depositions.''
   After reading the note, Zoarski said he had no choice but to
order a mistrial.
   Gold said a mistrial ``is one of those things that happens,''
and he vowed to pursue the lawsuit he filed five years ago.
   Attorneys for Newman indicated they would file a motion within
five days asking the judge to decide the case in their favor.
   Both sides ruled out a settlement.
   Jurors were ordered not to talk about the case after the
mistrial, but some indicated to reporters that the panel wasn't
close to reaching a verdict.
   Joseph Grassi, jury foreman and a philosophy professor at
Fairfield University, said a number of jurors were ``extremely
disappointed.''
   ``As of tomorrow it (the trial) would have lasted exactly one
month and this month has been wasted now,'' Grassi said.
   The jury, which had deliberated eight hours over two days, was
sent home Wednesday after its foreman told the court that it had
received depositions from Gold and some defendants, and wanted to
see Newman's.
   W. Patrick Ryan, Newman's attorney, said Wednesday it appeared
the clerk who took exhibits into the jury room inadvertently also
took the depositions.
   Gold alleged that an attorney for Newman promised him 8 percent
of the stock from Newman's Own Inc. Gold said he contributed 30
months' effort to Newman's company and believed his work led to the
corporation's success.
   Gold sued Newman; his two food companies, Newman's Own Inc. and
Salad King Inc.; author A.E. Hotchner, and food distributor David
Kalman and Kalman's company.
   The defendants denied all of the allegations.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982.
   Newman said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four
people who contributed to the food venture but Gold was not among
them. He also said he decided not to give away any stock after his
lawyer advised him against it.

<HEAD>US Trade Chief Sees Possible Escalation of Farm Subsidy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRAINERD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter on
Thursday raised the prospect of U.S. escalation of the
already-costly farm subsidy battle unless progress is made on
eliminating all subsidies by the year 2000.
   Yeutter said Congress could very likely increase export
subsidies, just as it did in 1985, if it appears that current
global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate.
   ``Sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in
order to achieve progress,'' Yeutter said at a news conference held
during trade talks with America's largest trading partners.
   The two days of discussions with trade ministers from Japan,
Canada and the 12-member European Community come on the heels of
the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto, where farm subsidies
were a major item of dispute.
   The allies rebuffed President Reagan's call for totally
scrapping subsidies. The final economic communique simply repeated
language calling for further negotiations aimed at reducing
subsidies rather than eliminating them.
   The world leaders directed their trade ministers to keep
negotiating, but officials said they did not expect any
breakthrough in this round of talks, being held at a resort in the
lake country of Minnesota.
   The trade ministers reported after the first session Thursday
morning that significant progress was being made in other areas,
particularly a U.S. effort to speed up the process for settling
trade disputes before the 96-member General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or GATT, the Geneva-based organization which governs
world trade.
   The GATT is conducting the current round of trade liberalization
talks, known as the Uruguay round because they were launched at a
conference in that country in 1986.
   Yeutter and his counterparts were hoping to narrow their
differences on a variety of issues from trade in services to
foreign investment so that progress can be made at a key Montreal
meeting in December, the halfway point for the current trade round.
   However, there are fears that the dispute over agriculture has
become so contentious that it could jeopardize progress in other
areas.
   Yeutter said that unless progress is made at the Montreal
meeting, pressure will build in Congress to further subsidize
American farmers so they can cmpete on world markets.
   He said congressional frustration would probably result in a new
farm bill being taken up next year rather than in 1990, when the
current subsidy program is due to expire.
   ``I am not making legislative threats. I am just giving you an
assessment of what could happen,'' Yeutter said.
   The 1985 farm bill significantly boosted U.S. subsidy payments
to help American farmers stay competitive on world markets. Last
year, the U.S. government spent $26 billion on farm support
programs.
   Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura said his country was
already upset over the congressional insistence on passing an
omnibus trade bill this year. A version minus the plant-closing
provision that prompted a Reagan veto has begun working its way
through Congress.
   Tamura said the new bill still contained many protectionist
provisions to which Japan objects.
   ``We have a strong belief that good sense will prevail and the
president will not sign the bill,'' he said.
   Reagan has not said what he would do if a second bill reaches
his desk, although congressional sponsors are predicting he will
sign it.
   All nations agree in principle that farm subsidies are a major
drain on their treasuries, but Europeans claim that political
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support
programs.
   Instead, they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidies
to a less costly level, perhaps one-half of where supports are
currently.
   Western Europe, the world's largest food importer in 1970, is
now second to the United States in the amount of food it exports.
   The United States is still the world's largest exporter of farm
commodities, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume of
wheat and feed grains sold on world markets. But since reaching a
record of $41.7 billion in 1981, U.S. farm exports steadily
declined for five years, falling to a low of $26.6 billion in 1986.
They posted a slight increase to $29 billion in 1987.
   The Reagan administration's push to reduce farm subsidies
through trade negotiations has generated very little reaction among
U.S. farm lobbying groups because they believe in part that the
American stand is just a bargaining position and will not actually
result in scrapping all subsidies.

<HEAD>Columnist Not Charged, But Youth He Shot Is</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan will not be
charged with assault after shooting a youth who had taken a
pre-dawn dip in his backyard swimming pool, the U.S. attorney's
office said Thursday.
   Instead, prosecutors reinstated charges of unlawful entry were
reinstated against Benjamin N. Smith, 18, of suburban Chevy Chase,
Md., and a companion, 19-year-old Laura Bachman of Bethesda, Md.
   Smith, who suffered a wrist wound in the June 14 incident, and
Ms. Bachman pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor charge before a
District of Columbia Superior Court hearing commissioner. Trial was
scheduled for Aug. 18.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said his office found insufficient
evidence to warrant an assault charge against the 62-year-old Rowan
but believed he should be charged with possession of an
unregistered firearm.
   The city government traditionally handles weapons charges, and
Claude Bailey, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Corporation
Counsel, said officials would and decide within a few days whether
to prosecute Rowan.
   Rowan, who has written frequently of the need for stringent
handgun control, refused to discuss the court developments with a
reporter.
   ``I am not saying one word about that decision,'' he said when
reached by telephone at his home by The Associated Press. ``I think
I've been very generous in talking to the media, and I've said all
I'm going to say.''
   Rowan told authorities the .22-caliber handgun used in the
shooting had belonged to his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent.
Rowan maintained that his son had been told by city officials he
did not need to register the weapon when he left the FBI.
   The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance says that all
weapons must be registered. Possession of an unregistered handgun
or ammunition carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   Neither Smith nor Ms. Bachman would comment after their court
appearance, but Smith's parents criticized Rowan's handling of the
incident.
   Neil Smith acknowledged that his son had committed an ``unlawful
act'' by entering Rowan's yard. But, he added: ``Was that act cause
for Mr. Rowan to shoot Ben and possibly kill him?''
   Dinah Smith said her son's judgment ``certainly showed
immaturity, but Mr. Rowan's judgment is appalling.''
   Rowan has said he called police after hearing noises in his
backyard, investigating and finding four people in his pool.
   The columnist said he fired at Smith after the young man lunged
at him. Smith disputes that, saying he was trying to flee when he
was shot.
   Smith and Ms. Bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in
jail and a $400 fine if convicted. The two had been charged with
illegal entry shortly after the incident, but those charges were
withdrawn within hours pending an investigation of the case.

   A member of the first successful team to climb
Mount Everest thinks the world's highest mountain needs a breather.
   Sir Edmund Hillary, who reached Everest's summit in 1953, said
too many teams are tackling the mountain, and expeditions should be
put off for five years to give snows time to bury trash from
previous climbs on Everest in the Himalayas.
   But if Everest is going to be tackled, Hillary said he would
rather see everyday climbers giving it a try rather than ``prima
donnas'' who criticize attempts made with the aid of oxygen, fixed
ropes and high altitude porters.
   Hillary was in Seattle on Wednesday on his way to Poulsbo,
Wash., to receive the 1988 Charles Lindbergh Award, given to people
whose life's work exemplifies a balance between technological
advancement and environmental preservation.
   Hillary, 68, lives in New Delhi, India, and is New Zealand's
ambassador to India, Bangladesh and Nepal.

   Forget the awards and the plaques. All
polka veteran Frankie Yankovic wants is his fans' appreciation.
   ``To know people appreciate what I've tried to do, that's what's

   Yankovic, 72, was inducted Wednesday into the Polka Hall of Fame

   Yankovic first appeared in the area 30 years ago at a

   Prince Edward apparently isn't a morning person.
   When he unveiled his wax likeness at Madame Tussaud's on
Thursday he joked that he wasn't sure if it resembled him.
   ``I don't know,'' said the 24-year-old prince, third son of
Queen Elizabeth II. ``I have never seen myself at this time in the
morning.''
   The ceremony was scheduled to fit in before his job at a theater
production assistant, and Edward told reporters, ``if you are
wondering why you are here at 8 a.m. it is because I did my
sittings at that time and I think I should look much the same.''
   Museum officials said the prince had not been included in the
royal family exhibit before because young people change too rapidly
to have a long-lasting likeness.
   The prince's wax figure was dressed in his own clothes and was
complete with true-to-life thinning hair, a fact the prince also
noticed.
   ``He's got more hair. That's slightly embarrassing,'' he said.

   A family is feeding worms to a nestful of
baby sparrow hawks after the birds' parents apparently abandoned
them to search for water and food amid the lingering drought.
   Five baby American kestrels, a type of small falcon commonly
known as a sparrow hawk, plopped down at the picnic table of June
Shawver's home in this community Monday.
   Family members have been giving worms to the brown-speckled
birds, which are members of a federally protected species.
   ``Sunday, I saw a bird out my window that I thought was an
owl,'' said Ms. Shawver. She now believes the bird was probably the
adult bird just as it was abandoning the nest.
   The next day, she found the babies, who are about 6 inches long
and will grow to up to 12 inches. The birds happily dined on worms
that the family had gathered to feed a pet turtle, she said.
   ``They were gobbling them up like crazy,'' Ms. Shawver said.
   Because the kestrels, like all birds of prey, are protected by
federal law, Ms. Shawver notified State Game Protector Jerry
Duckworth. Duckworth said it was not normal for parent birds to
leave a nest like that.
   ``More than likely it was the lack of water and insects that
prompted the birds to abandon the nest,'' Duckworth said. ``There
was not enough food for the parents to survive, so they left.''
   While it is illegal to possess the kestrels, dead or alive, the
Shawvers will be allowed to feed the baby birds so long as they are
not confined in any way, Duckworth said.
   The birds are gradually getting adult feathers, Ms. Shawver said.
   ``You can see them changing every day,'' she said. ``The female
is the most aggressive. She is bigger than the rest. She seems to
stand up by herself a lot.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress and spokesmen for postal
workers expressed alarm Thursday over the shipment of biological
toxins and other deadly agents through the U.S. mail system, saying
the items are not properly packaged at times.
   But officials from the Defense Department and the Centers for
Disease Control, both shippers of such items, defended their
procedures and said elaborate packaging precautions are taken.
   The Postal Service said it is considering tighter regulations
that would ban the shipment of some disease-causing agents and
microorganisms from its mail service.
   The action is being considered because an expected increase in
such shipments through the Postal Service could cause a possible
hazard to postal workers, Frank Henselton, assistant postmaster
general, said at a congressional hearing.
   The proposed regulation was to be issued Thursday followed by a
45-day comment period before a final rule is taken under
consideration, he said. Many of the shipments of disease-related
agents already are shipped by private overnight carriers.
   The Postal Service's assurances did not ease some of the concern
expressed by members of a subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil
Service Committee.
   ``These viruses are intended for warfare, they're intended to
kill people,'' declared Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., adding that
they should not go through the regular mail system.
   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union,
called plans by the U.S. Army to expand its shipment of toxic
materials through the postal system ``bizarre'' and a ``devious
scheme'' that should be rejected.
   He said that at the very least the Postal Service should require
a permit to ship toxic specimens ``and should require advance
notice before it is presented for acceptance into the mailstream.''
   Eighteen members of Congress sent a letter to Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci earlier this month expressing their concerns about
the Army's plan to expand the shipment of toxins by registered mail
from research centers around the country to a proposed testing
center at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.
   Such shipments, said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ``will expose
postal workers and the general public to an unacceptable health
risk.'' She said the Army has gone ``to great lengths'' to describe
the safety precautions being taken at the proposed laboratory but
shows a lack of concern with shipping safeguards.
   Thousands of toxins and disease agents are shipped through the
postal service by private laboratories as well as the Defense
Department and the CDC, witnesses said. While the shipments require
strict packaging, in some cases up to five layers of packing, there
still are spills, witnesses said.
   Gerald Miss, a Postal Service mail handler from Frederick, Md.,
said he and his colleagues frequently have observed shipments that
are not properly packaged.
   Miss said that last November he came across a dripping styrofoam
parcel containing flu vaccine, which dripped over his hands and
onto his apron.
   ``Though the spill did not result in an illness it points to a
potential threat,'' he told the subcommittee.

   Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture
Thursday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GNP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported that an export-led
manufacturing boom and a surge of investment spending by businesses
kept the economy growing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.6 percent in the January-March period.
   The figures represent a downward revision of a previous estimate
of GNP growth in the first quarter. A month ago, the government put
GNP growth at 3.9 percent. However, in April, the initial estimate
was a much lower 2.3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMIC FORECAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, boosted the Reagan administration's GNP forecast for all
of 1988 to 3.5 percent. At the same time, he predicted that
consumer price inflation would hold steady at 4.3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CORPORATE PROFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said the after-tax profits of U.S.
corporations fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter, the poorest
showing since profits dipped 3.7 percent in the first quarter of
1987. Profits were up a moderate 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARM SUBSIDIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BRAINERD, Minn. _ Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter raised
the prospect of U.S. escalation of the already-costly farm subsidy
battle unless progress is made on eliminating all subsidies by the
year 2000.
   Yeutter said Congress could very likely increase export
subsidies, just as it did in 1985, if it appears that current
global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The stock market retreated slightly in moderate trading. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials, which hit the highest level since
the October crash on Wednesday, retreated 3.91 points to 2,148.29.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>DOLLAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gyrated in world trading but managed to finish mostly
higher on key markets, maintaining its recent gains amid
profit-taking and rumors of central bank action to keep the
currency in line. Still, traders acknowledged that despite the
recent rally, nothing fundamentally has changed to ensure a
continued increase in the dollar's value.
   Gold prices eased.

<HEAD>Keillor Settles Suit With NPR Over Tape of Speech</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garrison Keillor and National Public Radio
said Thursday they had settled a lawsuit that the star of ``A
Prairie Home Companion'' brought alleging copyright infringement.
   The terms of the settlement call for NPR, through Keillor, to
make available free to people who request them 400 cassettes of a
disputed speech Keillor made in October 1987 at the National Press
Club in Washington.
   The speech covered various topics and promoted his book,
``Leaving Home.'' NPR, which long has transmitted National Press
Club luncheon appearances to member stations, included the speech
in its catalog of cassettes for sale.
   In his lawsuit, filed in Minneapolis, Minn., Keillor said he
never gave the radio network permission to use the speech.
   ``It was an expensive suit and they tried to punish me as much
as possible and make it cost as much as possible by going through
days of tortuous depositions, and after they put us all through the
grinder as far as they could, they agreed to stop doing what I was
suing them to stop doing,'' he said in an interview Thursday.
   ``I never wanted any money from them, and there was never any
money asked for,'' he said. ``I just wanted them to leave my work
alone.''
   Keillor had sought in the suit to have all unsold tapes
destroyed and a list of people who had bought the tapes. He also
had asked for unspecified damages and attorneys fees.
   NPR defended its sale of the cassette, saying it handled
Keillor's appearance before the press club no differently than it
handled talks by others.
   The nonprofit radio network said it has distributed tapes of
those events to the public through its cassette catalog since 1979
and has more than 130 titles.
   Spoken Arts Inc. of New York, which produces and distributes
some cassettes for NPR, was included in the settlement. Officials
at Spoken Arts were out of the office and not available for comment.
   NPR said it believes Keillor's book publicist was aware when he
arranged the appearance that cassettes would be distributed and
that Keillor also was aware of the arrangements.
   ``NPR thinks it is important to preserve its right to distribute
programs and cassettes of press club appearances as part of its
service to the listening public,'' the radio network said.
   Keiller's nationally broadcast variety show, ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' which was produced by Minnesota Public Radio and
distributed by American Public Radio, was discontinued a year ago.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Thursday
that, after a long discussion with a top aide to Michael Dukakis,
he thinks there'll be no quick decision on a Democratic vice
presidential candidate.
   Meanwhile, a political adviser to both Cuomo and Dukakis said
the New York governor had agreed to stump the nation in support of
Dukakis' presidential campaign.
   Cuomo said he had talked Wednesday with Paul Brountas, who is
leading the effort to find a running mate for Dukakis, about the
vice presidential selection process and came away with the
impression that it would take awhile.
   ``They do not seem to me the kind of people who would make
precipitous judgments or very early judgments,'' said Cuomo. ``I
don't expect a quick decision.''
   Cuomo said he and Brountas talked about Jesse Jackson and the
New York governor's role, but he did not provide details. He noted
that a Dukakis-Cuomo ticket was not discussed.
   ``That's not even a question,'' said Cuomo.
   Brountas didn't return telephone messages left at his office.
   Meanwhile, former Cuomo aide Michael Del Giudice said the
governor would soon be helping the Dukakis campaign in other ways.
   ``The Dukakis people want him to talk in other parts of the
country, getting out the Democratic agenda and talking about
Dukakis,'' said Del Giudice, a Wall Street investment banker who
served as chief of staff to Cuomo during the governor's first term.
Del Giudice helped put together Dukakis' successful New York
primary campaign.
   The former Cuomo aide said the New York governor would ``take a
very active role'' in the Dukakis campaign and had already
scheduled speaking engagements in California and Florida.
   Cuomo, once considered a possible 1988 Democratic presidential
candidate himself, remained neutral through the New York primary
and didn't endorse Dukakis until the primary season ended June 7.
By then Dukakis already had the nomination sewed up.

<HEAD>US Official Says Soviet Withdrawal `Well Under Way'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Afghanistan is ``well under way'' with the Russians pulling out
their troops on schedule, a senior State Department official
testified Thursday.
   ``So far we see no evidence that the Soviets do not intend to
meet their troop withdrawal deadlines on Aug. 15 and Feb. 15,
1989,'' Undersecretary of State Michael H. Armacost told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   But Armacost resisted demands by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
that the United States immediately appoint an ambassador at large
to deal with the Afghan resistance movement.
   He indicated that the Reagan administration prefers to wait
until a full-fledged government emerges that has widespread support
of the Afghan people before extending any sort of official or
informal recognition.
   Humphrey, who testified before the committee, also asked that
U.S. aid to Afghan refugees be doubled.
   Richard S. Williamson, assistant secretary of state for
international organizations, said emphasis is being put on
organizing a United Nations relief and resettlement program for the
Afghan people, some 5.5 million of whom are refugees in either
Pakistan or Iran.
   Williamson said that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 the
United States will have made about $142 million in relief funds
available for Afghan refugees.
   The State Department does not intend to seek a supplemental
appropriation to provide additional funds for the period because of
budget constraints, he said, adding: ``Our continuing programs are
consistent with, supportive of and will be closely coordinated with
the U.N. effort.''
   He said the United States is encouraging other nations to make
substantial contributions to the Afghan relief effort administered
by the U.N.
   ``In our appeals we point out that we are by far the largest
donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghans and that others should
now assume a major share of the new burden as the refugees begin
their return home,'' he said.
   Williamson also made clear that the Soviet Union is being asked
to bear a large share of the costs.
   ``It destroyed the country of Afghanistan. It is obligated to
pay a major part of the bill to rebuild it,'' he said. ``But its
contribution to the U.N. must come without strings or any
requirements that the funds be used to bolster the illegitimate
Kabul regime.''
   He said the Soviets also should help in eliminating the danger
posed by the thousands of landmines thay have planted on Afghan
territory.

<HEAD>Dukakis Backs Tax Hike At Home; Jackson Says He's Made Up Mind On

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis announced his backing
Thursday for $115 million in new taxes to ``make sure the state's
fiscal base is solid and strong'' and also faced questions about
his administration's acquisition of land for a new prison _ a deal
now under scrutiny by the FBI.
   On the Republican side, George Bush had breakfast with former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick while an independent group called
``Americans for Bush'' announced plans to spend $10 million
supporting him in the presidential campaign.
   Jesse Jackson said he's made up his mind about the Democratic
vice presidential nomination but won't reveal his decision unless
asked by Dukakis.
   Making two long-awaited fiscal decisions certain to provide
campaign ammunition to the Republicans, the Democratic governor
announced he had signed a $40 million cigarette tax and favored
raising another $75 million by bringing the Massachusetts tax code
in line with federal tax law changes.
   Dukakis said he had balanced nine state budgets, a record he
characterized as in ``sharp contrast'' to that of the Reagan
administration.
   ``I think the people of this state and the people of this
country can recognize when someone is talking about fiscal
responsibility and someone who is doing it,'' Dukakis told a
Statehouse news conference. The Massachusetts Constitution requires
the governor to balance the budget although Dukakis has twice
inherited deficits.
   In statements issued in Washington and Boston, the FBI
acknowledged it has opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if
federal laws were violated in connection with a proposal to place a
new state prison in New Braintree, Mass.
   ``Gov. Michael Dukakis is not the subject of an investigation,''
FBI spokeswoman Kathy Bradford said in Washington.
   Residents of the rural community of 800 people waged a bitter
fight against placement of the medium-security prison in their area
and some opponents have contended that the current owners of the
700-acre parcel had inside information that the property would be
chosen as the site of the new prison.
   A development firm owned by Gary Striar and Gary Jacobson bought
the land from the Seventh Day Adventist Church in 1985 for $3
million. They have offered to sell it to the state for $9.5 million.
   Jacobson and his wife contributed $1,000 each to Dukakis'
presidential campaign, the maximum allowed by law.
   Asked about the deal, Dukakis told reporters in Fall River,
Mass., ``The process was as open as it could possibly be. ... We
have very tough procedures for the acquisition of property.''
   Jacobson and Dukakis grew up near each other in the Boston
suburb of Brookline.
   The governor told a statehouse news conference upon his return
from Fall River that he was unaware who owned the land when he
chose it as a prison site.
   ``One of them grew up around the corner from me and I remember
shoverling his parents' driveway,'' he said. ``Any suggestions that
the secretary of human services and his staff proceeded other than
in accordance with the law and strict standards of integrity are
unfortunate and regrettable.''
   Jackson added a new element to speculation over whether he is
interested in the vice presidential nomination when he was asked in
Washington whether he had privately made an decision on whether
he'd accept second place on the ticket if it were offered by
Dukakis.
   ``Privately, yes,'' he replied.
   Had he informed Dukakis?
   ``No,'' he said. ``That would be public.''
   Jackson met with his state campaign chairmen for pre-convention
planning and then flew to Puerto Rico. Although Jackson won Puerto
Rico's beauty contest primary, Dukakis ended up with all of the
territory's 57 delegates.
   ``No doubt there will be some adjustments made in Puerto Rico,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, the Democratic Party made what chairman Paul G. Kirk
Jr. claimed was history by settling all delegate challenges before
the July convention in Atlanta.
   After the last four disputes, involving delegates in Indiana,
Kansas, Maine and Virginia, were settled, Kirk said it was the
first time the Democrats would open their convention without a
single delegate challenge.
   But disputes over platform issues were far from over.
   One of those was highlighted Thursday when Dukakis was asked if
he could support Jackson's call for an independent Palestinian
state.
   ``No, of course not,'' he said.
   ``I support direct negotiations between Israel and its neighbors
and responsible Palestinians who ... recognize Israel's right to
exist within its borders,'' Dukakis said. ``I'm going to do
everything I can as president to create an environment in which
these discussions can take place.''
   Republican Party chairmen from 13 Southern states met in
Charleston, S.C., and were told by Bush campaign manager Lee
Atwater that the vice president would be emphasizing the
differences between himself and Dukakis in the fall campaign.
   ``It's obvious to me the Democratic Party and the Dukakis
campaign has made a very conscious decision to try to make the case
there's not a lot of difference between the candidates,'' said
Atwater, a native South Carolinian.
   ``Americans for Bush,'' unveiled the first of what it said would
be a series of television commercials supporting Bush.
   The commercial describes Bush's career as a Navy pilot,
businessman, member of Congress, U.N. ambassador, U.S.
representative in China and as vice president. Floyd Brown, a
spokesman for the group, said $330,000 was being spent to air the
commercial on several cable networks.
   Bush had no public appearances, but he began the day with a
breakfast with Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who is often mentioned as a
possible vice presidential candidate. The former United Nations
ambassador is a favorite of GOP conservatives who like her tough
anti-communist positions on foreign policy.

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told
President Reagan on Thursday that it is too early for emergency
relief measures to deal with effects of the drought, a White House
spokesman reported.
   ``Despite the serious potential effects of the drought, the
secretary said rainfall in the next two weeks would alleviate much
of the potential damage,'' Deputy Press Secretary B. Jay Cooper
said.
   Vice President George Bush, however, said in a separate
statement, ``If conditions continue to deteriorate, money that has
been saved in this year's farm programs will be redirected to farm
families as disaster relief for the rural economy.''
   Rising crop prices are expected to reduce the direct subsidies
that would have to be paid to farmers this year, saving an
unspecified amount of federal money.
   Cooper said Lyng also reported that the Presidential Interagency
Drought Policy Committee is establishing a toll-free telephone
number to answer questions about federal services available to
citizens in drought-stricken areas.
   The hotline begins operation Friday and will operated from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT on
Saturdays. The number is 1-800-541-3375.
   Cooper said Lyng briefed the president and vice president and
then the Cabinet in separate meetings. He said Lyng showed Reagan a
map that demonstrated the worsening condition of the drought in
many areas of the United States.
   ``The secretary said that in discussions he has had with
congressmen and senators, farm groups and governors, there was
agreement that it is too early for emergency relief measures,'' the
White House spokesman said.
   Cooper said Lyng also reported that the Agriculture Department
and other agencies have taken some steps to help, such as allowing
haying and grazing on conservation reserves.
   The spokesman quoted Reagan as saying after the meeting, ``Our
No. 1 worry right now is the effects of the drought on the farmers
and their families and making certain they receive any help we can
provide.''

<HEAD>Billy Martin's Fifth Term as Yankee Manager Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billy Martin was fired as manager of the New
York Yankees for the fifth time Thursday and was replaced by his
predecessor, Lou Piniella.
   Principal owner George Steinbrenner made his 15th managerial
change in as many years just a day after the Yankees' third
straight loss to the Detroit Tigers and three days after the team
fell out of first place in the American League's Eastern Division.
   Martin, a second baseman the great Yankee teams of the 1950s,
was suspended once and fined twice this season for throwing dirt on
umpires. Earlier, his face was battered in a fight in a Texas bar.
   Piniella, who managed the Yankees in 1986 and 1987, was
appointed general manager at the end of last season but resigned on
May 29.
   He joins Martin, Bob Lemon and Gene Michael, who was named
third-base coach on Thursday, on the list of those Steinbrenner has
fired and re-hired as manager.
   Martin was hired as Yankee manager in 1975, led the team to a
World Series title in 1977 and was fired in 1978. He was rehired
and fired during the 1979 season, brought back in 1983, fired the
next year and replaced by Yogi Berra. Berra was fired during the
1985 season, Martin returned, then was fired at the end of the
season.

<TEXT>
   The Education Department is letting high-level
officials get away with abuses for which low-level employees and
program beneficiaries are punished harshly, a House subcommittee
chairman said Thursday.
   ``High-ranking officials have gotten off with slaps on the
wrist, while low-level employees and program participants have been
disciplined or prosecuted to the full extent of the law,'' Rep. Ted
Weiss, D-N.Y., said in opening a hearing on criminal cases
investigated by the department's inspector general.
   ``Our preliminary review of these cases indicates that justice
is not blind when it comes to corruption at the Department of
Education,'' said Weiss, who chairs the Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources.
   Much of the discussion centered on two-year-old charges against
Madeleine Will, assistant secretary for special education and the
estranged wife of conservative columnist George Will.
   The inspector general, James B. Thomas Jr., said his office
recommended that Mrs. Will be criminally charged based on findings
that she had used a department car and driver for personal
business, had claimed travel expenses that were never incurred, and
had authorized payments to a special assistant in her office for
four months after terminating the woman's employment.
   Thomas said the assistant U.S. attorney indicated the case would
be prosecuted, but Joseph DiGenova, the U.S. attorney at the time,
decided it should be treated as a civil matter. Mrs. Will and two
others involved paid restitution totaling $15,000 to the department.
   Thomas said he wrote two letters asking why the U.S. attorney's
office had decided not to prosecute. Some weeks later he received a
reply citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent and an
overall lack of merit.
   ``I was uncomfortable with it,'' Thomas said of DiGenova's
decision. ``When we have sufficient evidence ... then I feel there
should be a prosecution.''
   Asked if the treatment of Mrs. Will was comparable to the
treatment of others charged with similar offenses, Thomas replied,
``The record on that is very mixed.''
   Mary Rose, deputy undersecretary for management, denied that
there was a double standard of justice at her department. ``Each
case is taken individually,'' she said. ``A number of factors have
to be considered,'' including whether a person is a career civil
servant or a political appointee.
   Guidelines attached to Rose's testimony said that by law,
willful use or authorization of a government vehicle for other than
official purposes must be punished by suspension of at least 30
days or removal. Rose said willful intent was never proved in the
Will case.
   The guidelines say penalties for falsifying an attendance record
for oneself or another employee should range from a five-day
suspension to removal for a first offense. The same range was
recommended for falsifying documents and actual or attempted theft
of government property.
   Weiss contrasted Will's case with several others, all recorded
in bi-annual reports to Congress by the department's inspector
general. Among them:
   _A department employee pleaded guilty to filing false time
records involving $2,000. She was required to make restitution,
received an 18-month suspended jail sentence, and was placed on
three years' probation.
   _A Utah man received a suspended jail sentence and paid a $2,500
fine for understating his income so his wife could get a $5,000
student loan.
   _An employee was fired and another suspended without pay for 13
days for backdating civil rights reports when they couldn't meet
timetables set by the department.
   _A department pool driver was suspended for 60 days without pay
for using his official vehicle on personal business.
   Mrs. Will, in a June 22 letter to The Washington Post, said she
did not know that her former aide was not at her work station while
her salary was continuing. She said she had acknowledged
responsibility by making full restitution, but ``never did I
knowingly violate any government regulation.''
   The letter, made available by the Education Department, did not
address the other allegations.

   Pope John Paul II recalled the evils of
Nazism during a meeting Thursday with President Kurt Waldheim, who
has been accused of being involved in war crimes while serving in
Adolf Hitler's army.
   Foreign diplomats did not attend a speech by the pope to church
and government officials including Waldheim, who has been virtually
ostracized internationally because of his wartime past. But
diplomats warmly greeted the pope at a reception afterwards.
   ``In this year of 1988, I should like to particularly recall the
great trials and cruel tyranny which Austria, along with other
nations, had to suffer in the not too distant past,'' John Paul
said in his speech, at the beginning of a five-day visit to
Austria, his second since becoming pope in 1978.
   ``Amongst the many who were persecuted for religious, racial and
political reasons were large numbers of Catholics _ priests,
members of religious orders and lay people,'' the pope said in an
ornate ceremonial hall of the Hofburg Palace.
   About 80 people, including government officials and church
leaders, attended the gathering. The pope delivered his address in
German.
   This year is the 50th anniversary of the ``Anschluss,'' when
Hitler annexed his native country in 1938. The event, coupled with
a war record that continues to dog Waldheim, has inspired
controversy and soul-searching. Waldheim has repeatedly denied
involvement in war crimes.
   In his own greeting, Waldheim thanked the pontiff for receiving
him at the Vatican in June 1987 _ a meeting that drew a bitter
response from Jewish leaders because of questions about the
president's war service.
   The Vatican said at the time that John Paul was receiving the
office, not the man. Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro has said of
the pope's trip to Austria: ``This is not a political visit, it is
a pastoral visit. He was invited by the bishops.''
   Waldheim and his family later posed for pictures with the
pontiff at the Hofburg Palace. Then the pope met privately with
Waldheim for about five minutes, but Navarro declined to say what
the two men talked about.
   Waldheim did not attend a reception afterwards where the envoys
greeted the pope, according to a pool report distributed to
journalists. The pope then retired for the night at the Vienna
archbishop's residence.
   Protests coincided with the pope's arrival.
   Earlier Thursday, John Paul said an evening Mass at St.
Stephen's Cathedral. As he was about to start, American Jews
displayed banners at the windows of a hotel across the square from
the cathedral. The banners said ``Nazi Waldheim'' and ``Don't Meet
Waldheim.''
   Police ordered the banners removed.
   Several hours before John Paul arrived, Rabbi Avi Weiss of
Riverdale, N.Y., and five other American Jews demonstrated outside
Waldheim's office.
   ``Do not embrace Waldheim, no!'' Weiss told a small crowd
attracted to the demonstration. The other five members of the group
were dressed in black-and-white striped uniforms similar to those
of concentration camp inmates.
   In New York, Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World
Jewish Congress, issued a statement saying: ``The pope's meeting
with his flock in Austria is not what troubles the Jewish
community. It is the deliberate inclusion of meetings with Kurt
Waldheim on his itinerary.''
   John Paul will make about 20 appearances in Austria, 85 percent
of whose 7.5 million people are Roman Catholic. He visited the
country for three days in 1983.
   Waldheim, smiling and wearing a blue suit, was the first person
to greet the white-robed pontiff as he stepped off the special
Alitalia jetliner at Schwechat Airport.
   The pope mentioned several places he will visit, including
Mauthausen, the Nazi concentration camp where 110,000 prisoners
died.
   ``Let us, when we meet, bring before God not only the great and
burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the
present,'' the pope said, speaking in German.
   Waldheim also denounced ``intolerance, intransigence and hate
among nations, religions and classes,'' but made no direct
reference to the dispute over his past.
   Most Western leaders shun Waldheim, who was U.N.
secretary-general for 10 years, because of allegations of
complicity in Nazi atrocities. The charges arose during the
election campaign two years ago.
   Waldheim denies wrongdoing but the United States has barred him
from the country, saying it has evidence he was involved in
deporting civilians while serving as a German army officer in the
Balkans during World War II.
   John Paul, on the 38th foreign pilgrimage of his papacy, also
will meet with representatives of Austria's small Jewish community
and address Roman Catholics from neighboring communist countries.

   Thirty rickety trucks and buses comprising the
Veterans Peace Convoy circled the White House on Thursday to
protest administration opposition to their mission of delivering
the vehicles and tons of food, medicine and clothing to Nicaragua.
   The convoy arrived in Washington from Laredo, Texas, where
customs officials seized four vehicles and barred the group from
crossing into Mexico without posting bond and signing an agreement
that the aging school buses and pickup trucks would be returned to
the United States.
   ``We have come to take care of the children of Nicaragua,'' said
convoy organizer Gerry Condon of San Francisco. ``We intend to
lobby and gain support for this convoy to pass. We want to feed the
children, not the war.''
   Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, expressed support for the group
with a resolution introduced in Congress on Wednesday that the
treasury secretary should not regulate the donation of articles to
relieve human suffering in Nicaragua.
   ``It's wrong to thwart the humanitarian impulses of the American
people. This tradition has sustained us and made us leaders
throughout the world,'' Leland said in a statement Thursday. ``How
ironic it would be to deny assistance to our own neighbors in the
Western Hemisphere. There are hungry and wounded children awaiting
this aid. People of good will wish to help them. We must and we
will find a resolution.''
   The Treasury Department contends that to let the vehicles remain
in Nicaragua would violate a trade embargo.
   But Condon said Reagan administration fears the vehicles would
land in the military's hands are unfounded. Four of the convoy's
original 38 vehicless did not survive the long trip from Laredo to
Washington because of mechicanical problems. The rest, Condon said,
are unworthy of military service because of the many miles they
have on them _ or would have on them by the time they reached
Nicaragua.
   The buses, adorned with slogans in English and Spanish such as
``Help the children,'' ``On to Managua,'' ``Nicaragua or bust'' and
``Bikes, not bombs,'' circled the White House to the cheers and
whistles of about 100 protesters.
   Convoy spokesman Craig Merrilees said the group, which is made
up mostly of Vietnam veterans, would continue its protest across
the street from the White House ``as long as it takes.'' But the
contingent may take the convoy to the State Department if Elliot
Abrams, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, refuses
their demand that he meet with them by Friday afternoon.
   Ellen Bork, a State Department spokeswoman, said the convoy's
request for a meeting was being considered late Thursday. She
initially said the convoy should instead contact the Treasury
Department, which is responsible for enforcing the trade embargo.
   The convoy formed after groups from Seattle, Missoula, Mont.,
Minneapolis, and Caribou, Maine, joined in Austin, arriving in
Laredo on June 7.
   The 30 tons of aid carried by the group includes oats and dry
milk and medical supplies such as crutches and wheelchairs.
   Another 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the group was
shipped to Nicaragua, members of the convoy said.
   ``The Reagan administration is trying to stop a massive
people-to-people humanitarian aid campaign,'' Condon said as an
anti-nuclear group chanted and beat on drums nearby.
   Convoy leaders have filed a lawsuit in Laredo against the
customs order.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor BDM International Says Ford Still Plans
Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Aerospace & Communications Corp. intends
to proceed with plans to take over BDM International Inc.,
according to BDM, the defense contractor whose name has surfaced in
the Pentagon contracting investigation.
   ``Based upon what Ford now knows concerning the government
investigation of defense contractors, Ford plans to proceed with
its tender offer,'' BDM said in a statement Thursday from its
headquarters in McLean, Va., just outside Washington.
   Susan Pearce, a spokeswoman for Ford, would not elaborate on the
BDM statement. BDM spokesman James Hughes did not return a
telephone call.
   The boards of directors of both BDM and Ford Aerospace, a
division of Ford Motor Co., approved the $425 million takeover last
month. Under the tender offer, which expires at midnight Friday,
Ford Aerospace will pay $34.75 per share.
   BDM's name has come up in the Pentagon investigation because
Melvyn Paisley, a former Pentagon official who is under federal
scrutiny, served as a consultant to the company after he left the
Navy in 1987. Paisley's wife, Vicki, also worked at BDM, first as
an employee and then as a consultant.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in Thursday's editions that
government officials are reviewing work performed by Mrs. Paisley
for BDM.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting sources it did not name, reported
Thursday that Paisley allegedly arranged an elaborate scheme under
which high-level Pentagon officials smuggled classified documents
out of the Pentagon and allowed him to copy them with the aid of
his wife.
   Federal investigators are looking into allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former members of the
military, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that
could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   No one has been charged in the case.

<TEXT>
   A group calling itself ``Americans for Bush''
said Thursday it will spend $10 million in an effort to elect
George Bush as the next president, including a series of television
commercials.
   But the Bush campaign says organizers of the effort have been
asked to stop using Bush's name in their fundraising.
   ``We feel that this committee has misrepresented itself,'' said
spokeswoman Alixe Glen. ``They're misrepresenting that their group
is an authorized campaign committee, and they're not.''
   She said the Bush campaign was not opposed to independent
efforts to help elect Bush, as long as those groups make it clear
they are not part of the authorized campaign committee.
   The first commercial, shown at preview for reporters, highlights
Bush's career as a Navy pilot, businessman, member of Congress,
ambassador to the United Nations and China and ``as Ronald Reagan's
trusted vice president.''
   ``George Bush will make a great president, but first we have the
tough job of getting him elected,'' retired Adm. Mark H. Hill says
in the commercial which solicits contributions to pay for more
advertising.
   The effort, which is independent of Bush's presidential campaign
and not subject to federal spending limits that apply to the
campaign itself, is being underwritten by the National Security
Political Action Committee.
   Hill told reporters the committee ``supports the initiatives of
the active-duty military'' and that the advertising effort would
seek to portray Bush as the candidate with the best record on
supporting the military.
   Floyd Brown, a spokesman for the organization, said $330,000 was
being spent to buy time for the first commercial on several cable
networks, including Cable News Network, and on stations in regional
markets. It will be shown starting next week, he said.
   Elizabeth Fediay, chairman of Americans for Bush, said the
commercial ``is only the beginning of the very active role that
National Security PAC hopes to have through the election, not only
to have an impact in helping to elect George Bush but also on a
number of senatorial races and some targeted congressional races.''

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Wins $960 Million Pentagon Contract for F-A-18
Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp., one of several
contractors under scrutiny in a defense fraud investigation,
received a $963.2 million contract Thursday for F-A-18 jet fighters.
   The contract, awarded by the Navy, calls for construction of 84
of the sophisticated jets _ the full number authorized for purchase
in fiscal 1988 by Congress.
   The Navy wants to buy another 72 of the twin-engine jets in
fiscal 1989.
   McDonnell Douglas is the prime contractor for the plane, which
is nicknamed the Hornet. The Northrop Corp., another defense
contractor under scrutiny, is a major subcontractor.
   Both McDonnell Douglas and Northrop were named in search
warrants executed last week by FBI agents investigating what has
been described as a massive fraud and bribery scheme. McDonnell
Douglas has been identified as a client of Melvyn R. Paisley, a
former assistant Navy secretary and now a defense consultant
believed to be one target of the investigation.
   The F-A-18 is the Navy's newest carrier-based fighter. It is
capable of being used either as an air-to-air fighter or as an
air-to-ground attack jet. FBI agents made a point of searching
McDonnell Douglas offices for documents involving potential sales
of the plane to U.S. allies.

<HEAD>FDIC Chief Sees Texas Bailouts Cutting Fund by 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fund that insures deposits in commercial
banks could decline by as much as 10 percent _ the first drop in
its 54-year history _ after the completion of three large bank
bailouts in Texas this year, the chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. says.
   L. William Seidman, in the text of a speech to be delivered
Friday to the Oregon Bankers Association on Friday, said the fund
should start growing again in 1989 after First RepublicBank Corp.
of Dallas, Texas American Bancshares and National Bancshares Corp.
are rescued.
   When Seidman announced a $1 billion infusion into First
RepublicBank in March, he noted the fund, which had $18.3 billion
at the end of 1987, could decline this year for the first time
since it was established in 1934.
   But the Oregon speech was the first time he said the loss to the
fund, which expects revenue of more than $3 billion this year,
would likely be limited to 10 percent.
   In 1987, the fund posted a small $50 million gain last year
despite a post-Depression record of 184 bank failures. Failures are
continuing at about the same pace this year and the FDIC is dealing
with larger institutions.
   The agency hopes by mid-September to find a private investor to
help in its rescue of First RepublicBank.
   The congressional General Accounting Office says preliminary
estimates of the ultimate cost of the bailout range up to $2
billion, which would make it the FDIC's largest ever, but it said
the fund's initial outlay could be even greater.
   Seidman said widespread weaknesses in the oil-drilling states of
Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska ``will continue to be a significant
burden for the FDIC, at least for the short run, but the FDIC fund
is sufficient to deal with the problems we can foresee at this
time.''

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge Tells Government To Decide Whether It Wants
Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case complained
Thursday about more delays in bringing Oliver L. North to trial and
called on the Reagan administration to speed up the
declassification of necessary documents if it wants the case to go
forward.
   ``The highest levels of the government have to make a decision
as to whether this case is going to go or if it's not going to
go,'' Gesell said during a hearing on the problems posed by reams
of secret government documents collected by independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh.
   The judge expressed frustration over Walsh's request for a
one-month delay in getting 150,000 pages of secret documents
cleared by an interagency task force.
   ``If you can't get a trial going soon there isn't going to be a
trial,'' Gesell warned both sides during the hearing in U.S.
District Court.
   Gesell said he was not ready to schedule a trial of the former
White House aide, even though he had been preparing to set a date.
   ``I anticipated when I came on the bench of issuing a trial date
notice tomorrow. I'm not going to do that. The case isn't ready,''
the judge said.
   Gesell suggested that Attorney General Edwin Meese III designate
a Justice Department official to review the situation to help the
administration decide whether it is ready to release secret
documents or whether the case has to be dismissed.
   The judge questioned whether ``we won't need to have a clear
decision from the administration itself that they want to try this
case or they don't want to.''
   Walsh said he already has consulted with Deputy Assistant
Attorney General John Martin about the secrecy problems and would
meet with other senior Justice Department officials.
   Some 82,000 pages of classified documents, many from the
National Security Council where North worked until he was fired in
November 1986, already have been turned over to the defense for
pretrial review.
   Of that group, Walsh said a ``much smaller number but still a
large number'' of documents will be relevant to the case.
   The prosecutor repeated previous assertions that the batch of
unprocessed 150,000 pages from the CIA or the Justice Department
contained little that would be relevant to the defense case.
   Walsh said the task force, composed of representatives of
agencies that originate the documents, needs more time to mark the
portions of the documents that must be redacted before they can be
introduced at trial.
   Gesell said he had deferred to the interagency task force out of
concern for national security concerns about disclosing the
documents in open court.
   But ``the obstacles keep arising,'' the judge said.
   Although he expressed confidence ``they are not trying to
torpedo the case or help the case,'' the task force members ``are
not in the position to judge the larger implications of the case,''
Gesell said.
   The judge said a high-level political decision is needed on what
material the administration will allow to be disclosed in court.
   On Wednesday, Gesell had ordered North to specify by July 11
what secret government documents he intended to disclose in court
to defend the charges against him.
   North, along with former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, are
accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale
profits to the Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on such aid.
   The judge has ordered four separate trials. North was designated
as the leadoff defendant by Walsh.
   The issue involves classified documents that North and,
ultimately, his three co-defendants would be allowed to introduce
into evidence to rebut the charges.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, a defendant
must notify the government of secret documents he wants to disclose
in court.
   The judge then decides whether the documents are indeed relevant
to the case. Under the law, Gesell can order the substitution of
secret documents that government doesn't want released with
statements of facts the material would prove if presented to the
jury.
   He can also dismiss the charges if there are too many secret
documents that the government wants withheld from the case.
   An alternative to dismissing all the charges would be to force
North to stand trial on some of the counts contained in the
indictment that wouldn't require extensive use of classified
documents.
   These might include charges that North lied to Congress about
his role in the covert effort to help the Nicaraguan rebels and
allegations he obstructed a presidential inquiry into the
Iran-Contra affair by destroying documents.
   Walsh's request to delay production of the remaining documents
and a defense complaint about the slow pace of pre-trial discovery
prompted Gesell to convene the hearing.
   Among other things, the defense complained that it has yet to
receive any of the government documents that Walsh's investigators
were allowed to look at but could not copy. These include relevant
pages of President Reagan's diary and schedule.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Federally Funded Abortions for Rape, Incest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted
Thursday to give victims of rape or incest the right to federally
funded abortions.
   The panel voted 15-14 to defeat a motion to delete the
provision, which had been added earlier this week by a subcommittee
to the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the departments of health and
human services, labor and education.
   The Office of Management and Budget, in a letter to committee
members, said presidential advisers would recommend a veto of the
$139 billion bill if it includes the abortion provision.
   The sponsor of the motion, Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., argued
before the committee that ``denying Medicaid funds to poor women
for what is legal in this country makes no sense.''
   The annual spending bill usually contains a provision saying
abortions can only be paid for under the federal-state Medicaid
program when the woman's life would be endangered by carrying the
fetus to term.
   The version approved by the committee would return the law to
its status before 1980. The same provision was added in 1986 in
committee, but removed on the Senate floor.
   The 1989 spending bill is expected to reach the Senate floor
next month.
   OMB called the new abortion provision a Medicaid expansion that
``diverges from longstanding policy on this issue.''
   Weicker called the OMB letter ``a waste of power'' that diverts
attention from the needs of the nation into ``narrow philosophical
issues.''

<TEXT>
   Two more Soviet envoys were expelled or barred
from Canada on Thursday in a spy squabble, and a Soviet Embassy
spokesman said his side would take further retaliation.
   The latest action by Canada brings to 19 the number of Soviets
expelled or barred from returning to the country since Tuesday. The
Soviets have expelled or barred five Canadians.
   The Soviets were accused of seeking military and industrial
secrets and trying to infiltrate Canada's intelligence agencies.
   Canada's External Affairs Department said Col. Grigori
Stepanovich Roublev, a top-ranking military attache at the Soviet
Embassy in Ottawa, was expelled Thursday and given until Monday to
leave.
   A former second secretary at the embassy, Sergei Mikhailovich
Kashtanov, was told he can never return to Canada.
   The government also announced it will cut by three the total
number of Soviet diplomats assigned to Canada.
   The reduction in accredited Soviet diplomats brings to 60 the
official Soviet diplomatic complement in Canada.
   Within minutes of the orders issued Thursday, spokesman
Vyacheslav Bogdanov at the Soviet Embassy said, ``There is no doubt
whatsoever that there will be retaliation'' by Moscow.
   The most serious rift in Canadian-Soviet relations in a decade
began Tuesday when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government said
eight Soviet diplomats and officials had been expelled and nine
others formerly posted in Canada would not be allowed to return.
   Moscow retaliated Wednesday by expelling two Canadian diplomats
and barring re-entry for three others, alleging espionage.
   A statement Thursday from Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark
said the espionage allegations against the Canadian diplomats in
Moscow are ``totally without justification.'' It said the latest
expulsions follow ``Soviet espionage activities in Canada which
have obliged the Canadian government to expel the Soviet
officials.''
   The statement gave no details of the alleged spying by Roublev
and Kashtanov, but Clark's press secretary Paul Frazer told The
Associated Press they were involved in ``unacceptable activities,''
the usual euphemism for spying.
   Frazer said Roublev has been in Canada since May 1985, while
Kashtanov served in Canada from February 1981 to August 1985.
   Asked why they had not been expelled earlier, Frazer said: ``We
think our response is appropriate in the circumstances.''
   He said the Soviet ambassador was called in Thursday and
informed of the latest action. He was also told that Canada was
willing to ``put the matter behind us'' if Moscow did likewise,
Frazer said.
   The last wave of mass expulsions was in 1978 when 13 Soviet
diplomats were expelled for trying to recruit a Royal Canadian
Mounted Police intelligence officer as a double agent.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said the latest Soviet spy ring
tried to infiltrate a U.S.-owned military contractor in Montreal,
Paramax Electronics, which has access to highly classified American
naval technology.
   Paramax, a subsidiary of Detroit-based Unisys Corp., is building
the combat systems for six new Canadian frigates and the radar,
sonar and communications systems for six other frigates.
   A Soviet translator at the International Civil Aviation
Organization in Montreal, Yuri Smurov, provided ``useful
information'' leading to the breakup of the spy ring, Clark said
Wednesday.
   Smurov has now defected and asked for asylum for himself, his
wife and daughter Christina, a fifth grade pupil.

Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ``greenhouse effect'' global warming of
the earth is here, but the current drought and heat wave over much
of the United States can't be blamed on it, a scientist told a
Senate panel Thursday.
   However, similar heat waves and droughts can be expected much
more often as a result of future warming, said James E. Hansen, a
climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York
City.
   Hansen told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in blaming rising
temperatures around the world on the buildup of manmade gases in
the atmosphere.
   For unknown reasons, the earth has been getting warmer for more
than a century, though with cooler intervals. The four warmest
years on record have been recorded in the 1980s _ and without what
Hansen called an improbable cooling for the rest of the year, 1988
will break all records.
   Though there has been much speculation by scientists around the
world that the warming resulted from the greenhouse effect,
Hansen's statement is the most definite yet.
   Syukuro Manabe, soil specialist at the Geophysical Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said it was more likely that the current drought
was the result of natural fluctuations than the greenhouse warming.
   ``It is an example of the kind of drought that will occur more
frequently as the global warming become larger,'' he said.
   Many studies have said global warming could bring drastic
changes in weather, including more rainfall at low and high
latitudes and more drought in between, with drastic shifts in
possible crop patterns.
   A major report from the World Meteorological Oganization and the
United Nations Environment Program earlier this month concluded
that without a major effort to fight warming, global temperatures
could increase by 0.54 degrees Fahrenheit per decade until the
middle of the next century, and sea levels could rise by a foot.
   Tropical temperatures wouldn't change much at all, but in Canada
the change could be two or three times as large as the average.
   Extreme temperatures would occur more often. Hansen earlier
calculated that instead of the typical one day a year with
temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Washington _ it
reached 101 on Wednesday _ the year 2030 could see 12 days. Dallas
would see 78 such days instead of 19.
   Gases emitted by modern civilization _ notably carbon dioxide
from the burning of fossil fuels but also methane, nitrous oxide
and the chlorofluorcarbon gases that major nations agreed last year
to reduce _ trap heat from the earth's surface that normally would
be radiated out to space just as the glass over a greenhouse traps
the sun's heat inside.
   Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are 10 percent
above 1958 levels and 25 percent above concentrations believed to
prevail in 1790, when the industrial revolution brought the first
widespread burning of coal in industry to fire the new steam
engines.
   ``If we could magically reduce (annual) emissions (of carbon) by
about 3 billion tons, we could stabilize the content of the
atmosphere,'' said George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole
Research Center in Massachusetts. ``It is well within reach, no
question about that.''
   ``The problem ... has the potential for turning the world into a
form of chaos not greatly different from that produced by global
war,'' he said.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., concerned about his state's coal
industry, asked physical chemist William R. Moomaw of the World
Resources Institute, a Washington-based policy research
organization, if technology could not reduce the harmful emissions.
   ``I'm trying to find a way to use a resource we have,'' Ford
said.
   Moomaw replied, ``I would argue the resource we have in most
abundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficiently

<HEAD>Another Blow to Brezhnev: Mansion Turned into Wedding Palace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The late Leonid I. Brezhnev's once-might image
fell a little farther Thursday. A white marble mansion built for
brief visit he paid to Baku will be turned into a wedding palace.
   Azerbaijan's Communist party built the mansion, which overlooks
the Caspian Sea, for the Soviet leader so he would have an
appropriate place to stay during a visit to the southern republic's
capital in 1982.
   He stayed only two days and the building has been unoccupied
since, according to reports by state television and the official
news agency Tass.
   ``This beautiful white marble building is well known to all Baku
residents, but hardly any one of them can boast of being in it even
once,'' a television correspondent said on Vremya, the evening news
program.
   He said the Azerbaijan party Central Committee acted under the
principle of ``social fairness'' in deciding to convert the mansion.
   ``Soon, Mendelssohn's march will ring out here for thousands of
newlyweds,'' the correspondent said as images of crystal
chandeliers flashed across the screen in shots of the mansion's
interior.
   In January, Soviet authorities stripped a city, town squares and
a Moscow neighborhood of Brezhnev's name.
   The two-story mansion, surrounded by a high concrete wall, was
built in the days when Geidar A. Aliev, a close Brezhnev associate,
was party chief in Azerbaijan. Aliev was retired from the ruling
Politburo at the age of 64 on Oct. 21, 1987, ostensibly for health
reasons but under a cloud of poor performances of industries he was
responsible for.
   The man who replaced Aliev as Azerbaijani party chief, Kyamran
Bagirov, was fired May 21, apparently for mishandling a territorial
and ethnic dispute with the neighboring republic of Armenia.
   Bagirov's leadership also received an implied blow on Thursday.
The television report said a complex of buildings where Azerbaijani
leaders had lived will be turned into a children's health center.
The report did not specifically mention Bagirov.
   The appropriation of lavish private mansions has a long
tradition here. When the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, they
converted many mansions of Russia's aristocrats and palaces of the
Czars for public use.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Brezhnev's name has
become synonymous with what Soviet officials call the ``period of
stagnation,'' a time when the economy fell into a slump. Brezhnev,
who ruled from 1964 until his death in 1982, has been blamed for
fostering complacency and cronyism.

   An amnesiac whose picture was
published in a newspaper was identified through fingerprints
Thursday _ by police who charged him with a Rhode Island murder.
   The man who called himself Robert C. Anderson was arrested
Wednesday by Newport, R.I., police, who tentatively identified him
as Robert J. Peabody, 49, of Newport.
   Newport Police Lt. Joseph Subin said Thursday that Peabody's
identity was confirmed by fingerprints. Published descriptions of
Anderson and Peabody had suggested some discrepancies.
   At an arraignment Thursday before Bristol County Superior Court
Judge George N. Hurd, Peabody waived extradition and was turned
over to Rhode Island authorities to face a murder charge. A
Massachusetts charge of being a fugitive from justice was dismissed.
   Peabody was wanted in connection with the slaying of William
Capuano, 34, whose bullet-ridden body was found in a bed and
breakfast inn on May 31. A medical examiner said he had been dead
for at least 48 hours.
   The man who called himself Anderson was picked up with razor
cuts on his arm by Bourne Fire Department paramedics on May 30 at
rest stop on a highway between New Bedford and Cape Cod.
   The man was first put in a hospital, then transferred to a
crisis center where he was arrested Wednesday.
   The Standard-Times of New Bedford published a story Saturday
about the man's search for his identity, and the crisis center
began telephoning area authorities for help.
   ``They ran his picture in the paper,'' Subin said. ``I guess the
center was calling around to see if anyone knew him and we said,
`Yes, we want him for murder.'''
   The man calling himself Anderson told The Standard-Times last
week that he was born July 5, 1944 in Fairfield, Calif., putting
his age at 43. Police said Peabody is a lifelong Newport resident.
   The newspaper said Anderson is blond, 6-foot-4 and weighs 190
pounds. According to employment records, Peabody is 6-foot-2, 205
pounds and has blue eyes and brown hair.
   Anderson told The Standard-Times he believed he was a cook by
trade. Police said Peabody worked in Newport restaurants.

<HEAD>Federal Job Applicants No Longer Will Take Written Exam</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to clarify that minimum GPA would be between

<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Applicants for civil service jobs no longer
will have to take written examinations under a new Reagan
administration policy that will rely solely on college grades or
job-related skills tests when hiring new workers.
   Constance Horner, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, said in a speech Thursday to a group of recruiters that
the shift will allow the government ``to pursue high-quality
candidates aggressively'' because they will be able to offer jobs
on the spot.
   The new policy will allow recruiters to hire any college
graduate with a minumum grade point average of somewhere between
3.0 and 3.25 on a 4.0 scale. Others could be hired after passing an
Individual Achievement Record skills test related to whatever job
is being sought.
   These tests, said the government agency, will measure ``the full
range of relevant personal qualities required for successful job
performance.''
   ``We want the strongest possible civil service and we're going
to get it under this plan'' Ms. Horner said.
   She said the government needs to change its criteria for hiring
to compete with private industry in attracting job applicants.
   ``The pool of young workers entering the job market will shrink
(to) ... the lowest since the 1930s'' during the next decade. ``For
the federal government this means that competition to hire and
retain qualified candidates will be fiercer than ever,'' she told a
recruiting conference.
   She said current testing procedures are ``so slow and
cumbersome'' that many of the best candidates for jobs go elsewhere.
   Horner said she hoped the details of the plan could be worked
out so the government could begin using the new hiring system by
next April.
   Horner said in a speech to a conference attended by government
recruiters that the new approach to selecting entry-level workers
will allow the government access ``to the most intellectually
strong, academically accomplished candidates'' and still ``ensure a
workplace reflective of American racial and ethnic diversity.''
   But Robert M. Tobias, president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, expressed concern about the change.
   ``Hiring on the basis of GPAs (grade point average) is contrary
to congressional intent that hiring be done through a competitive
exam that is nationwide in scope,'' he said.
   Horner's proposal also was criticized by her OPM predecessor,
Donald Devine, as ``a sad day for the civil service when it can't
have an objective civil service exam.''
   The government has had no entrance test for more than 100 jobs
since 1982 when the Professional and Administrative Career
Examination was discarded after it was deemed to be racially
discriminatory.
   Since then, hiring has been done using a temporary special
process of interviews, recommendations and college grades that U.S.
District Judge Joyce Hens Green ruled last year was ``arbitrary and
capricious.''

<HEAD>Millions Of Duplicate Records Found That Could Reopen Disability
Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration announced Thursday
the discovery of 10 million military medical records that duplicate
some lost in a devastating 1973 fire, and said it will review
disability claims that were rejected because of the lost files.
   Thomas K. Turnage, the VA administrator, said the agency just
became aware of the records last week and it was too early to tell
how many people would be affected. But he called the development
``very important.''
   ``It opens up new vistas for us. It means that these people who
before had difficulty establishing a basis for their disability
compensation, or the degree of it, ... it means we can have another
chance to look at it and, in effect, may come up with a different
result,'' Turnage said.
   John Sommer, the director of the American Legion Veterans
Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission, whose office helps veterans
with their disability claims, said the development potentially
could affect thousands of former military personnel.
   ``We've handled many cases where there were no records because
of the fire and it's very difficult to develop additional evidence
on which to try to get these claims allowed,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``You'd be amazed at the number of people, World War II veterans
in particular, who waited until they retired to file a claim with
the VA, and then found the records had been destroyed,'' Sommer
said. ``Many of them felt they just didn't want to take anything
from the government.... Then, as they aged, they decided to file a
claim and discovered their records had been burned.''
   Eighteen million military personnel records were destroyed or
seriously damaged in the July 12, 1973 fire at the National
Personnel Record Center in St. Louis, Mo. The lost records were
from the years 1912 through 1959 for Army personnel, and 1947
through 1963 for Air Force personnel with the surnames of Hubbard
and through the letter Z.
   The duplicate records cover the years 1942 to 1945 and 1950 to
1954, so will primarily affect veterans of World War II and the
Korean War.
   The records were collected by the National Research Council, a
private research organization, during the 1950s as part of its
analysis of Army hospital records. A researcher at the council came
across the records and notified the National Archives, said Jill
Brett, an archives spokeswoman.
   Ms. Brett said the records are on computer magnetic tapes
created by the council from admissions punch cards prepared by the
office of the surgeon general. She said the archives paid the
council $8,662 for the tapes and will reformat them for
cross-referencing against other files.
   The records were not listed by the military officer's name, but
included the officer's serial number, grade and rank, age, date and
place of admission as well as disease and diagnosis, Ms. Brett said.
   Veterans applying for monthly disability benefits as a result of
injury or illness suffered while on active duty must have some
verification of their claim. Turnage said he did not have figures
on how many disability claims had been denied as a result of the
lost records.
   There were 3.5 million files that turned up for the year 1944
alone, Turnage said, covering about 2.4 million people. For 1945, 2
million files were discovered, covering about 1.4 million people.
   But officials cautioned against the notion that millions of
veterans would be affected by the discovery. R.J. Vogel, the VA's
chief benefits director, said that most of the veterans who made
disability claims did so during their initial years after service
and likely would have filed claims before 1973.
   Those most likely to be affected by the discovery of the records
include people with an injury suffered during active duty which was
aggravated over the years, such as a back or heart ailment, Vogel
said.
   The VA said it would immediately begin reviewing disability
claims rejected because of the lost records. The agency said it
also expected many veterans would come forward seeking information
about their claims. It said those people should contact their VA
regional offices.

<HEAD>Mining Town Dreads Renewed Fighting As End of Truce Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this small mining
town dread the end of a truce that gave them nearly three months of
relative peace from fighting between U.S.-backed rebels and leftist
Sandinista government troops.
   Both sides have sympathizers here, but everyone ``fears the
return of the fighters,'' said Maria Toledo, owner of a small food
shop.
   Santo Domingo nestles between two hills in the central Chontales
province, a region which has seen intense fighting during the
6{-year-old war between the rebels, known as Contras, and the
Sandinistas.
   Military sources say the violence has steadily diminished since
a cease-fire began March 23.
   The town's only ambulance, once busy transporting war wounded,
now ferries sick children to the local health center. Residents
like Eudoro Castro, 43, are now left more or less in peace.
   Castro explained how he's gotten by in a war that has killed
26,500 people, wounded another 25,000 and nearly destroyed the
Nicaraguan economy.
   ``The Contras come along and demand a cow. I give it to them,''
Castro said. ``The Sandinistas come by, I give them one too. I'm
happy they are leaving me in peace now to work.''
   Military sources admit there have been some abuses by Sandinista
soldiers, abuses that have helped the Contras build a strong base
of popular support in the region.
   The fatigue-clad soldiers are still here, but now they doze on
the shaded sidewalks instead of preparing for another round of
combat.
   This region is also headquarters for a Contra force of about
2,000 rebels.
   Military sources who asked not to be identified said the army
has been in contact with various rebel factions during the
cease-fire, attempting to persuade them to lay down their arms. The
army has had little success, the sources said.
   The truce is due to expire at the end of June.
   The last round of talks between the Contras and Sandinistas fell
apart in Managua on June 9 and no new talks have been scheduled.
The government has proposed another round in the capital starting
June 26, but the rebels have not responded to the offer.
   Meanwhile, the people of Santo Domingo wait, dreading renewed
hostilities.
   ``We want to live in peace,'' said Felix Perez Garay, a
53-year-old food vendor who lost a son and three grandchildren, all
Sandinista soldiers, in the war.
   ``We want to forget our hatred and have a new life,'' Garay
said. Pointing to the bullet-shattered windows of the church, he
said: ``The war leaves only this.''

<HEAD>Navy Announces Schedule for Retiring 16 Frigates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has set up a schedule for retiring 16
aging frigates in a budget-cutting move that prompted the last
secretary of the service to resign.
   The Pentagon said Thursday the Navy had decided to remove from
active service 10 of the frigates by the end of this calendar year
and the remaining six in 1989.
   The first eight of the 16 ships being retired prematurely will
be decommissioned during the month of September, the Pentagon said.
The last of the 16 will be retired in September 1989.
   ``The final disposition of each ship has not been determined,''
the statement added.
   ``Crewmembers will be reassigned to other Navy commands based on
manning priorities. Every consideration will be given to satisfy
individual duty preferences and minimize family and command
difficulties.''
   The 16 ships are operated by more than 5,100 sailors.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced early this year in
unveiling the Pentagon's fiscal 1989 budget proposal the Navy would
retire 16 older frigates and postpone indefinitely its goal of
building a 600-ship fleet.
   The defense chief said the move was just one of several designed
to shrink U.S. military forces rather than maintain a ``hollow''
force that wasn't ready to fight.
   That decision was roundly _ and publicly _ criticized by Navy
Secretary James H. Webb, who asserted Carlucci and his aides had
ignored realistic budget alternatives he advanced. Saying he could
not work for Carlucci under the circumstances, Webb abruptly
resigned in February.
   Thursday, the Pentagon said the Navy was preparing to begin the
decommissioning of the Brooke-class and Garcia-class frigates in
September ``due to fiscal restraints.''
   The Pentagon also acknowledged, however, that four of the 16
ships slated for retirement were now in the midst of overhauls. In
each case, the overhauls will be completed before the ship is
retired.
   The Navy said the four overhauls were costing a total of $78.5
million and were under way before the decision was made to retire
the ships. The service also estimated it would cost $11.2 million
to mothball the vessels _ or $700,000 per ship. The Navy declined
to estimate how much money it would save in operating costs.
   It released the following schedule for decommissioning:
   _USS Talbot, Mayport, Fla., September 1988.
   _USS Page, Norfolk, Va., September 1988.
   _USS Edward McDonnell, Mayport, September 1988.
   _USS Bradley, San Diego, September 1988.
   _USS Brooke, San Diego, September 1988.
   _USS Ramsey, San Diego, September 1988.
   _USS Schofield, San Diego, September 1988.
   _USS Sample, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, September 1988.
   _USS O'Callahan, San Diego, November 1988.
   _USS Davidson, Pearl Harbor, December 1988.
   _USS Furer, Charleston, S.C., January 1989.
   _USS Garcia, Charleston, March 1989.
   _USS Brumby, Charleston, March 1989.
   _USS Voge, Mayport, August 1989.
   _USS Koelsch, Mayport, September 1989.
   _USS Albert David, San Diego, September 1989.
   The four ships currently receiving overhauls are the Furer, the
Garcia, the Brumby and the Koelsch.

   The rain came _ not much, but it came _ 40
minutes ahead of schedule after a Sioux Indian medicine man gave
prayers and offerings for rain in a traditional ceremony.
   Florist Cliff Doebel said he brought Leonard Crow Dog here from
South Dakota, at a cost of $2,000, last weekend to make people
aware of the drought and warn them that they may not be able to
rely on Ohio's agriculture this year.
   After performing his ceremony, Crow Dog said the rain should
arrive Thursday. It began falling at 11:20 p.m. Wednesday.
   The National Weather Service does not have an official rainfall
monitor in Clyde, but precipitation in nearby northwest Ohio
communities late Wednesday and early Thursday ranged from 0.22 inch
in Fremont to 0.08 inch in Milan, forecaster Matthew Peroutka said.
   ``It's not enough, and the situation is still here and still
severe,'' said Doebel. ``But I think it was enough to help some of
the corn out.''
   ``I'm not one to know those answers (of why it rained),'' he
said. ``All I know is you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up
heads.''
   Crow Dog, 45, arrived by plane Saturday and spent the night in a
tepee erected in a field near the Doebel greenhouse. He performed a
traditional ceremony, using prayers and offerings to summon the
``four winds of the earth'' to bring rain.
   Crow Dog left Ohio early in the week, saying his work was done,
Doebel said.

<HEAD>FCC Will Consider Measures to Curb Abuses in License Renewal
Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission agreed
Thursday to consider measures designed to curb abuses in a
broadcast license renewal process that allows ``extortion and sham
applications'' by license challengers seeking profitable
settlements.
   The FCC commissioners voted 3-0 to consider changes in the
system by which radio and television station owners renew their
licenses and defend themselves against charges by competing
companies that apply for the license to run the station.
   The license-challenge process is aimed at bringing to the
commission legitimate issues related to a station owner's
qualifications.
   But commissioners said they were concerned that some license
challengers may have no interest in running a broadcast station and
may file competing applications or petition the agency to deny an
incumbent's license only so they can profit from a financial
settlement.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the commission will ``not
... tolerate extortion or sham applications.''
   The FCC said it would consider whether to limit the amount of
money an incumbent licensee could pay a challenger to withdraw a
competing application or to prohibit such payments altogether.
   The agency also will consider requiring competing applicants to
identify financial contributions from those backing the application.
   The FCC also will consider changes in its policy of granting
stations ``renewal expectancy'' to give the industry more
stability. Such status is currently awarded based on a station's
past service to its community.
   Patrick said he wanted to develop a policy with the least amount
of second-guessing of a station's programming decisions.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cool front brought some relief from the heat Thursday in parts
of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, but most of the nation's
midsection continued to swelter and suffer.
   Afternoon readings were already in the mid-90s to around 100
degrees from the central high Plains through the lower Missouri
Valley into the Tennessee Valley and mid-Atlantic states.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered Thursday afternoon
across the upper Mississippi Valley, the strongest one moving
across parts of southeastern South Dakota and northeastern Nebraska.
   Thunderstorms were also scattered along a Canadian cold front
that was sagging south across the northern mid-Atlantic region.
   Showers and thunderstorms, accompanied by gusty winds and heavy
rain, were widespread along the Gulf of Mexico coast into Florida.
There were also isolated storms across the deserts of Southern
California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Nashua, N.H., to 109 at Phoenix and Glendale, Ariz. The
early morning low for the nation was 40 at Truckee, Calif.
   The national forecast for Friday called for continued sunny and
hot weather across much of the nation. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were predicted across the Great Lakes into parts of
Iowa; from southern Texas across the Gulf Coast into the southern
Atlantic Coast and much of Florida; and in parts of the desert
Southwest and Great Basin.
   Highs will be in the 70s along the California coast and from
Upper Michigan through much of New England; 80s across the Pacific
Northwest and from the Great Lakes into the mid-Atlantic states;
between 100 and 105 across the central Plains; above 105 in the
Southern California valleys and the desert Southwest; and in the
90s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Biggest Cocaine Shipment In Island History Found On Plane, Police
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A twin-engine plane that skidded to
a stop on its nose in an abandoned airfield Thursday was carrying
half a ton of cocaine, the largest shipment ever seized on the
island, police said.
   Six people were in custody for questioning and helicopters were
still combing the area late Thursday for another who escaped,
police spokesman Tony Santiago said. No charges have been filed.
   Police said the cocaine shipment was the largest ever
intercepted on its way to Puerto Rico. They estimated its street
value at $720 million.
   ``Direct to Puerto Rico, this is the largest to date,'' Santiago
said. Last August more than 2,000 pounds of cocaine were found in
the steel beams of more than 20 shipping containers bound for
Florida.
   The plane arrived in San Sebastian, 80 miles west of San Juan,
around 2 a.m. and scraped to a stop on its nose as it tried to land
on a runway formerly operated by the government, police said.
   Occupants of a pickup truck waiting nearby raced over, unloaded
seven dufflebags with about 400 pounds of the drug and took off in
a hail of gunfire when federal and local drug agents arrived at the
scene.
   After a chase though the darkness the truck fell into a ditch
and its occupants escaped, police said.
   About 675 pounds of cocaine was found in the plane, wrapped in
individual packages of about 2 pounds each, police said. They
described the plane as an ``expensive'' Fairchild with a six- or
seven-seat capacity.
   Five men and a woman were later picked up nearby. At least four
of them were believed to be local residents, Santiago said.
   Several weapons, including an Uzi machine gun with loaded
magazines, a Magnum 357 pistol with extra shells and an AR-15 rifle
were also seized, along with several portable radios.
   Officials said they did not know where the plane came from, but
that most aircraft intercepted in the area with drugs aboard come
from Colombia.

   David Letterman will go back on the air next
Tuesday, with or without his writers but with their blessing in any
event, head writer Steve O'Donnell said Thursday.
   O'Donnell said the writers were hoping that the striking Writers
Guild of America would grant a waiver for the ``Late Night'' show
to resume next week with its writers, but were still awaiting word.
   ``That means we will be by his side, but if not, he'll go back
on the air just the same, no hard feelings,'' said O'Donnell.
``We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the best
thing is to get the show on the air.''
   As of Thursday night, NBC would not confirm that Letterman was
going back on the air.
   Johnny Carson went back on the air last month without his
writers. He is writing his own monologues.
   ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' and ``Late Night''
went into reruns when the writers went on strike four months ago.
   Letterman, a member of the guild, would not be violating the
strike by going on the air in his capacity as a performer.
O'Donnell said if the writers do not get a waiver and Letterman is
on his own, he will make ``casual remarks'' at the beginning of the
show, then interview guests.
   O'Donnell said Letterman attended Wednesday night's meeting of
the Writers Guild of America East, where a vote was taken on the
latest contract offer by the producers.
   The vote was not yet final Thursday night, but supporters of the
contract conceded they did not have enough votes to end the strike.
   Letterman's show had previously sought an independent contract
with the guild, but that plan was scrapped because the show is a
production of NBC.

<HEAD>Police Surround Students at Buddhist Shrine</HEAD>

   Police formed a tight ring Thursday around
the gold-encrusted Shwedagon Pagoda, this Buddhist nation's holiest
shrine, where student protesters set up a ``strike center.''
   Students in green sarongs, the uniform of high school students,
tried unsuccessfully to enlist residents of Rangoon in a march to
the hilltop pagoda. The march did not take place.
   Demostrations also were reported in Pegu, about 50 miles north
on the Rangoon-Mandalay railroad. Classes were suspended at the
main schools in Mandalay, the nation's second-largest city, but no
disturbances were reported.
   Rangoon spent its third night under a 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew and a
ban on public meetings, which were imposed after street violence in
which nine people were killed by official count.
   University students have led three major rounds of protest since
October, the first since 1974 against the 26-year-old regime of
Gen. Ne Win, whose economic policies and wars on ethnic minorities
have impoverished this Southeast Asian country.
   Hundreds of people have been arrested and Western diplomats say
100 may have died in street violence, most in rioting March 18 and
since.
   Witnesses said police closed the pagoda to the public at 5 a.m.
and surrounded the grounds, on which protesters established their
``strike center'' Wednesday.
   Students began arriving at the shrine Wednesday morning after
authorities shut down the Rangoon Institute of Technology. Some of
the last worshipers to leave said about 500 students were there,
but the figure could not be confirmed.
   No information was available on the student demands or what was
happening inside.
   Shwedagon Pagoda sits on a hill in Rangoon's northern suburbs.
Its gilded central stupa, or tower, soars 325 feet above a temple
base adorned with more than five tons of gold.
   Burmese are almost fanatically devoted to the shrine, which
legend says was founded 2,500 years ago. It has survived wars,
earthquakes and the British occupation, during which it was a
center for anti-colonial nationalists.
   Residents reached by telephone in Mandalay, about 380 miles
north of Rangoon, said classes were suspended at Mandalay
University, the Medical College and the Government Technical
Institute. The action appeared to be precautionary, since no
trouble was reported.
   Similar reports from Pegu said an overnight curfew was imposed
Wednesday after students and other rioters destroyed or heavily
damaged government buildings, vehicles and cooperative stores. Pegu
was the seat of several ancient kingdoms.
   Western analysts say restrictions on individual freedoms and
poor economic conditions are spurring the protest.
   Although Burma is rich in resources and has an educated
populace, its per capita annual income of less than $200 puts it
among the poorest nations. Ne Win's ``Burmese Way to Socialism''
mixes military control, socialism and few dealings with the outside
world.
   Most merchants in Rangoon's sprawling market districts closed
their shops at noon Thursday for fear of looting if violence
resumed. Some government employees went home before normal closing
hours.
   Attendance was minimal at high schools and the Education
Institute, the only center of higher learning still open in
Rangoon. Teachers were told to continue classes regardless of the
attendance level.
   No major incidents have been reported since the curfew took
effect Tuesday. A few street vendors and drivers of taxis and
rickshaws have been arrested for going out before 6 a.m., but were
reported freed after warnings.
   The latest trouble began Tuesday when 5,000 students and other
protesters in Rangoon fought police with stones.
   Students at several institutions demonstrated peacefully last
week for legalization of student unions and release of detained
comradesd. The government closed the school and the government
responded with violence.
   Trouble began last October when the government declared much of
the currency in circulation to be invalid and did not offer
compensation. On March 18, after several days of unrest, police and
soldiers quickly crushed a rampage in downtown Rangoon by students
and other protesters.
   A government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people
were arrested, but diplomatic sources told reporters in Bangkok,
Thailand, as many as 100 people have been killed since October.
Many of those arrested have been released.

   A federal agency is investigating an
arson fire at a Georgia warehouse owned by the same company whose
Massachusetts plant was ravaged by fire over the weekend, routing
25,000 people from their homes.
   While the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was
looking into the Georgia warehouse fire Thursday, Georgia
investigators were on their way to Springfield to take a look at
the burned-out plant, Springfield fire department spokesman Giorgio
Placanico said.
   ``We'll probably go down there, too,'' Placanico said.
   Firefighters in protective suits continued carting barrels of
chloride out of the remains of the 18th-century mill Thursday as
ambulances stood by in case pockets of fumes overwhelmed the
workers.
   The Springfield plant burned for four days, spewing a
three-mile-long gas cloud across the city of 170,000 and forced
thousands out of the neighborhood before firefighters controlled
the last of several fires Monday.
   The first fire apparently was sparked by rainwater that fell
through a window of the Advanced Laboratories Inc. plant and mixed
with chloride tablets that the plant makes for swimming pools,
causing a violent reaction. The later fires are under investigation.
   A June 10 fire at a Weatherking South Inc. warehouse in
Doraville, Ga., owned by the same company, also appears to be
accidental, said Chuck Johnson, a spokesman for the DeKalb County
public safety department.
   But the second fire Tuesday in Georgia was clearly the work of
an arsonist, he said. ``There was no other way that fire could have
started,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The arson fire destroyed the 30,000-foot swimming pool supply
warehouse, which also housed offices, Johnson said.
   ``The unusual number of fires here and up there have forced us
to make the connection,'' Johnson told the Union-News of
Springfield. ``We think they are associated and so we've called in
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to help us.''
   An agent with the bureau said investigators are working only on
the Georgia fires and have not been called in to help with the
Springfield investigation, which is being handled by the city arson
squad.
   But he added that the federal investigators are keeping watch on
what the Springfield fire officials turn up.
   ``Nobody can say yet whether these fires were arson or
accidental,'' said agent Terence McArdle. ``But we are keeping an
eye on it. When two company plants have chemical fires, we are
interested.''
   No one was hurt in the Georgia fires, which released a small
amount of chlorine gas but forced no evacuations.
   An estimated 275 people have gone to Springfield-area hospitals
for treatment since the first fire ignited Friday, but none of the
injuries has been reported to be serious.
   Advanced Laboratories and Weatherking South are both wholly
owned subsidiaries of Aquafab Industries Inc. of New York, a pool
supply firm owned by John P. Perreira of East Greenwich, R.I., and
Boca Raton, Fla., and Robert M. Petrin of Coventry, R.I., according
to records filed with secretaries of state in Massachusetts and
Georgia.
   The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering has released records showing that since April 1986,
state officials have investigated a series of incidents at the
plant, including charges that the firm was illegally dumping
chlorine chemicals in a nearby pond.
   An attorney for the company has said the owners will have no
comment until the damage from the fire has been assessed.

   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said
Thursday federal programs will provide relief for drought-stricken
farmers, but governors meeting in emergency session questioned
whether those methods were adequate.
   During a brief appearance before the 10 governors who gathered
for the day-long conference, Lyng promised the federal government
``will do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage.''
   But the agriculture secretary also reminded the gathering that
there were several existing aid programs already in place, and he
stressed repeatedly that the extent of the damage from the drought
was yet to be determined.
   But Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota, speaking at a closing
news conference, said farmers in several states already had lost
much of their cash crops and others have sold off entire livestock
herds for lack of feed grain.
   ``Where I think he (Lyng) is wrong is in the wheat area,'' said
Sinner. ``That damage is done and it is very, very severe. In the
livestock feed area, that damage is done and it's going to grow.''
   Sinner also said government programs must be made flexible
enough to ensure that farmers hurt by the current drought aren't
disqualified from participating in crop-insurance and disaster-loan
program because of ``technicalities.''
   ``I'm afraid we're going to lose some farmers,'' he said, ``and
we've lost enough already in my state.''
   That message echoed throughout the day.
   ``Welcome to the heart of the droughtland,'' Illinois Gov. James
Thompson said in opening the conference. ``We used to be known as
the heart of the heartland. Now we are both.''
   In his speech, Lyng noted that 1,200 counties in 30 states
already have been granted permission for grazing livestock or
making hay on government-rented land normally set aside for
conservation or crop-reduction plans.
   He also pointed out that task forces already have been set up
within the administration and Congress to study the consequences of
the drought. The federal government's crop-insurance and
disaster-loan programs could serve large number of farmers once the
extent of the damage from the drought becomes clear, he said.
   ``The situation is still fluid. ... We'll need a little bit of
time to learn what the losses are,'' he said.
   Before he left the conference, Lyng said he would meet with
Reagan on Friday morning to update him on the drought situation.
   But several governors suggested the situation in their states
already demands a more-specific response from the federal goverment
_ even if they had different ideas on what the response should be.
   Illinois' Thompson said the barge traffic along the Mississippi
River so crucial to agricultural states like Illinois was paralyzed
because of low water levels, and proposed he U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers seek permission to divert water from Lake Michigan to
solve the problem.
   That proposal, however, was disputed by Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson.
   ``It might turn out to be more disastrous over the long term
than the immediate salvation it provides,'' said the Wisconsin
governor.
   ``It's an idea we should explore. I'm just saying we should not
go quickly, though.''
   Tommy Thompson said restoring last year's 50-cent price cut on
federal dairy support programs and blocking a second cut next
January ``would do more for Wisconsin farmers than anything but
rain.''
   Given the differing needs of the states represented, Thompson
was asked how they would reach agreement on priorities.
   ``That's difficult,'' he said, ``any time you deal with
agricultural issues, everybody has a different agenda. ... But this
issue is crucial enough for us to find a common ground.''
   Attending the day-long meeting, besides Sinner and both
Thompsons, were the governors of Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota,
Mississippi, Ohio, Kansas and Nebaska.

   Some watermelons no longer rate as seedy
characters.
   Two California companies, Sun World and Petoseed Co., are
marketing seedless watermelons, which are showing up in
supermarkets across the nation for the first time.
   Sun World has launched a national marketing effort for its
seedless watermelons, while Petoseed has provided several growers
with seeds and is promoting hybrid seedless varieties the company
developed.
   The need to spit out the seeds to the juicy fruit has long been
the pits, but the idea of ending such expectorating has been around
a while, too.
   ``The process by which it is produced was developed in the late
1930s,'' said David Marguleas, Sun World's merchandising manager.
   Seedless watermelons didn't catch on then because they were
``very difficult to grow, very expensive to farm, and production of
seed for seedless watermelons was produced on a very limited
basis,'' he added.
   Dr. O.J. Eigsti continued work on developing seedless
watermelons in Oklahoma. He had no commercial success until recent
years when his American Seedless Corp. formed a joint venture to
have Sun World promote and distribute them.
   Petoseed began a breeding program in 1976 to develop seedless
watermelons for sale in Japan, said Jim McConnell, the company's
product marketing coordinator. The Japanese have eaten seedless
watermelons produced by their own farmers for more than two
decades, he noted.
   Petoseed has developed three seedless varieties, which have been
planted on about 600 acres this year.
   Sun World, which markets about 75 California-grown fruits and
vegetables, test-marketed seedless watermelons grown on 180 acres
last year, then expanded production to 2,000 acres this season,
Marguleas said.
   Regular watermelons with seeds were grown on more than 15,000
acres of California farm land in 1986, the last year for which
state statistics have been compiled. The crop that year totaled
186,000 tons valued at $27.7 million.
   Sun World seedless watermelons will be available in most major
markets during the summer, said Marguleas, who was in New York City
last week promoting the product to food editors.
   ``Not only gone are those annoying black seeds, consumers also
found the flavor sweeter and crunchier than the average
watermelon,'' Marguleas said.
   Barbara Buck of the Western Growers Association said Sun World
seedless watermelons will carry ``a sticker on the side that says
they are seedless with a disclaimer that says they may contain an
occasional seed.''
   Consumers will find a couple of other things different in
comparing seedless varieties with regular watermelons.
   Both Marguleas and McConnell said seedless watermelons could
cost two or three times as much as seeded watermelons, which now
range from 9 to 19 cents a pound.
   McConnell said the difficulty in growing seedless watermelons
and the extra cost will limit their popularity to about 15 percent
of the market.
   ``I don't see it as taking over the watermelon market,'' he
said. ``I see it as a specialty item.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin left
Thursday for a week-long visit to the United States during which he
said he would present American officials with plans for the future
of the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Rabin said he would meet with President Reagan and other top
U.S. officials but described his trip as a ``regular visit.''
Israeli officials did not disclose Rabin's itinerary for security
reasons.
   ``I will take an opportunity before the U.S. elections to thank
a sympathetic, supportive administration, and particularly
President Reagan who has done so much for Israel's security,''
Rabin said before departing from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.
   The defense minister said he planned to discuss with U.S.
officials the Middle East situation and the Arab uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has claimed the lives of
211 Palestinians and four Israelis since it began last Dec. 8.
   ``I'm bringing them some plans for the future,'' Rabin said
without elaborating.
   Rabin's visit comes amidst U.S. criticism of Israeli policies in
the occupied territories. The latest criticism came Thursday, when
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering accused Israel of violating
Palestinian human rights.
   Speaking at Bar Ilan University near Tel Aviv, Pickering called
on Israel to stop deportations, administrative detentions, house
demolitions and other measures of what he termed collective
punishment.
   Israel has deported 21 Palestinians since the uprising began. As
of June 9, at least 2,500 Palestinians have been served with
administrative detention orders, a measure allowing the army to
hold a suspect in jail for a period of up to six months without
trial.
   In apparent response to Pickering's criticism, Rabin revealed
plans to release some Palestinian detainees. He said between 50 and
80 prisoners are beingh released every day.
   ``If a village or a family have shown good behavior, we are
going to release some detainees from the area,'' Rabin said. ``We
want to use the carrot as well, not only the stick.''

   A woman pregnant with twins
underwent an emergency Caesarian section Thursday after being
injured in a bomb blast. One of the babies died and the other was
in critical condition, officials said.
   The 20-year-old mother, Michelle Ebrahim, was reported in
serious condition at Johannesburg Hospital. The babies were
delivered seven weeks prematurely.
   Mrs. Ebrahim, her husband, and their 2-year-old daughter were
among 10 people injured Wednesday when a limpet mine exploded at a
video game arcade in downtown Johannesburg.
   There have been more than 20 bombings in South Africa this year,
killing eight people and injuring 59.
   The government has blamed the attacks on the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement. The ANC, which is fighting
the government because of its policy of apartheid, has not claimed
responsibility for specific attacks in recent months but has said
it seeks to intensify its guerrilla operations.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   A federal judge threw out a $24 million damage suit
Thursday against former CIA officials, Contra leaders and cocaine
traffickers accused of running an arms-for-drugs smuggling scheme.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King dismissed the case
against Iran-Contra figures Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, former
CIA deputy director of operations Theodore Shackley, former Maj.
Gen. John K. Singlaub and 25 other defendants, including leaders of
Colombia's violent Medellin Cartel.
   The suit was filed two years ago by the liberal,
Washington-based Christic Institute on behalf of journalist Tony
Avirgan, injured in the 1984 Nicaragua bombing aimed at maverick
Contra leader Eden Pastora.
   King said the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention
that a wide-ranging conspiracy was responsible for the La Penca
bombing that injured Avirgan and later threats aimed at covering up
their involvement.
   The trial had been scheduled to start Monday.
   ``That's fantastic,'' said Shackley in Washington when told of
the dismissal. ``It's what I have been saying all along: There is
no basis to the damn thing.''
   Shackley's sentiments were echoed by Thomas Spencer, attorney
for Singlaub and one of the most active defense lawyers in the case.
   ``We're elated,'' said Spencer. ``Now it's payback time. We're
going to file some actions for malicous prosecution and
defamation'' against the Christic Institute and their attorney
Daniel Sheehan.
   The Christic Institute in Washington issued a terse response to
the judge's decision.
   ``We're going to appeal immediately,'' said Director Sara
Nelson. Their spokesman, Peter Dykstra, said he felt the decision
was an effort to delay the case until after the November elections.
   Although only 13 of the defendants had filed motions for summary
judgment, King said the case was not strong enough for trial
against the remainder.
   ``The plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine
issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at La
Penca, the threats made to their news sources, or threats made to
themselves,'' wrote King.
   The damage and racketeering suit charged that the defendants
were members of a right-wing terror network dating to 1959 and
illegally participated in assassination plots, gun running and drug
trafficking.
   Other well-known defendants included Contra director Adolfo
Calero; reputed Medellin Cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and
Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Iran-Contra figure Robert Owen, Costa Rican
rancher John Hull and former mercenary Sam Hall.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public, and many of the names it brought
to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional
committees investigating that case.
   The suit accused the defendants of funding illegal Contra
activities with drug runs in cooperation with the Medellin Cartel,
and threatening, imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened
to uncover the ring.
   Affidavits filed with the suit say the Contra involvement was
simply the latest venture of what Sheehan called an
``off-the-shelf, stand-alone, self-financing'' operation dating to
the botched Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vietnam War.
   According to the suit, Shackley and others, using drug profits,
assassinated officials in Vietnam, Iran, Nicaragua and other
nations. By keeping the operation off the books, they could violate
federal laws and avoid congressional oversight.
   When the reform administration of Jimmy Carter was elected in
1976, Shackley took the operation completely private to avoid
scrutiny, Sheehan says.
   The key event in the suit was the May 1984 bombing of a news
conference held by Pastora.
   Three journalists and five Pastora supporters died in the
explosion, although Pastora was only slightly injured. Avirgan was
seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion, allowing
him and his wife, Martha Honey, to file a civil damage suit under
federal law.
   According to the suit, that bombing was arranged by Shackley,
Contra leaders and others angered that Pastora refused to join
anti-Sandinista groups he considered too close to deposed
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
   All the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the
charges.
   In a May 6 hearing, Sheehan accused members of the Reagan
administration of trying to block the suit because of potential
damage to Vice President George Bush. Bush led the CIA in 1976,
when, Sheehan said, Shackley and others in the agency went private
with the ``secret team.''
   Andy Messing, head of the Washington-based conservative
foundation, National Defense Council, was initially named in the
suit but was dropped after a few months.
   He denied involvement in any weapons or drug allegations, saying
his foundation emphasizes only humanitarian aid for Central America.
   ``Acts of legal terorism like this against the U.S. justice
system should not be tolerated,'' he said. ``They obviously
couldn't even get close to making their case because it was dropped
with prejudice.''
   He said the suit was a polticially motivated suit and named
``innocent people with nefarious people to besmirch the names of
the innocent people. ... They threw in a lot of nefarious
characters to give it credence.''

   Tall pine trees will shield many sensitive
operations of an east Texas army installation from Soviet observers
arriving in mid-August to watch the burning of medium-range nuclear
missiles, officials said Thursday.
   Morton Thiokol Inc., the contractor operating the Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant, won a $1.1 million contract that will allow it to
burn 74 of about 800 rocket motors being eliminated under a joint
U.S.-Soviet treaty
   The plant, about 170 miles east of Dallas, is one of two sites
the Army selected to burn the Pershing missiles banned under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   Under the pact, a team of up to 20 Soviet observers will watch
the burning _ and little else.
   ``On-site inspection does not mean that the Soviets will get a
free look at our secrets,'' said Lt. Col. Allen L. Germain, plant
commander.
   Morton Thiokol Inc. officials said they have received the
blessing of state and environmental officials to burn the missile
motors through static firings and by open-air ignition.
   Soviet observers, mandated by the treaty to watch the burnings,
will arrive at the Gregg County Airport, stay at area motels and
dine in local restaurants but will have little to do with
residents, company officials said.
   ``We plan no special events or contacts with the community for
the Soviets,'' Germain said. ``Our contacts will be professional _
a charge we take seriously. We have a detailed security plan.''
   The two superpowers must, under the terms of the treaty signed
by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, reduce
their medium-range nuclear missiles within three years.
   The other Army-authorized burning site, in Colorado, has raised
the ire of some environmentalists.
   Dave Harris, spokesman for the Army Missile Command in
Huntsville, Ala., said Colorado officials have no previous
experience with rocket motor testing and want the military to
answer questions about the project.
   The Army conducted a static missile firing in late May for
Colorado officials ``to establish whether we can meet their
requirements'' he said.
   Data from that firing will be analyzed and released next month,
said Harris, adding he was confident the Army's application for
missile burning at the Pueblo Army Depot would be approved.
   Missiles to be burned in Texas would be hauled by rail or truck
from several locations, primarily Pueblo, said George L. Huffman,
Morton Thiokol plant engineering manager for the Longhorn Divison.
   At the Longhorn plant, reporters were taken by bus down
tree-lined roads to a signal testing area, where missile motors
will be fired, then to a circular field where solid rocket
propellant will be burned in open-air cages.
   ``This is the exact route the Soviet vistors will be taking when
they come for on-site inspection,'' Huffman said. ``All they can
see, with any significance, is we have a lot of trees,'' said
Huffman.
   At the static test site, the two Pershing stages _ each about
nine feet long and 40 inches in diameter, will be locked in turn
horizontally on a metal-and-concrete stand and ignited.
   Each stage contains thousands of pounds of granular propellant.
Static firing takes about 45 seconds, while open-air burning of the
fuel requires 10-15 minutes, Huffman said. But he added static
firing is environmentally perferred because the combustion is more
complete.
   The plant's pine forests will help to muffle noise from the
rocket motors, Cornish said.

   A 49-year-old convict who claims he died two
years ago and should be freed from his life sentence lost his case
Thursday when a judge ruled he never legally died.
   Jerry Rosenberg hoped to convince Cayuga County Judge Peter
Corning that he ``died'' during open heart surgery, was brought bac
to life by doctors and therefore had fulfilled his sentence of life
in prison.
   Corning ruled instead that Rosenberg failed to meet the
definition of death set forth in 1984 by the Court of Appeals, the
state's highest court; it said death occurs when there is no brain
activity or the heart and lungs irreversibly stop functioning.
   ``As his presence in this courtroom indicates ... he did not
die,'' Corning said.
   Rosenberg, who was returned to the Auburn Correctional Facility
after the ruling, said he planned to appeal.
   During the hourlong hearing, Rosenberg maintained that the
definition of death was ambiguous and that two kinds of death
existed, irreversible and reversible.
   He argued that he died a natural death when his heart stopped
during surgery and was revived by artificial means.
   ``The higher courts, the Supreme Court has never defined death.
They've defined life,'' Rosenberg said in a crowded courtroom.
``Reversible death, which is a medical term, means they bring you
back from death to life, not life to life.''
   Ken Goldman, an assistant attorney general, presented affidavits
from doctors that countered Rosenberg's claim.
   ``Thousands of people undergo bypass surgery, recover, and are,
therefore, not pronounced dead,'' wrote Dr. Erik Mitchell, Onondaga
County medical examiner.
   And the cardiac surgeon who performed the operation on
Rosenberg, Dr. Leslie Kohman, wrote that having a patient's heart
stop during heart bypass does not ``represent any untoward
occurrence.''
   Corning asked Rosenberg, who was convicted for the 1963 murder
of two policemen, if he believed that everyone whose heart stopped
during heart surgery should be considered legally dead. Rosenberg
said yes.
   That would mean, Corning surmised, that under Rosenberg's theory
everyone who has heart surgery could collect on life insurance
policies or be legally divorced, among other things.
   ``Yes, yes,'' said Rosenberg, who has earned several law degrees
from correspondence schools during his 25 years in prison. ``I know
this is far-reaching and I'm opening up a can of ... not worms, but
boa constrictors.''
   Goldman said he suspects Rosenberg is just trying to get
publicity for his planned second book and made-for-television movie
called ``Afta Death.'' Rosenberg's life already has been the
subject of a book and TV movie.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Plainclothesmen briefly arrested
the nephew of former Prime Minister Martial Celestin Thursday in a
crackdown on supporters of deposed President Leslie Manigat by the
new military government.
   ``He seems to have been arrested this morning,'' Celestin said
of his nephew, Alix Celestin. ``I have no idea why.''
   Family friends told The Associated Press that armed men in
civilian clothes took Alix Celestin away in handcuffs and stole
what jewelry they could find in his house.
   A few hours later he was released ``thanks to the intervention
of a very highly placed person,'' a friend of the family said,
without elaborating.
   More than a dozen Manigat supporters and their relatives,
including American citizens, have been arrested after Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy overthrew Manigat and proclaimed himself president
early Monday. Others say they plan to go into hiding.
   The coup ended four months of civilian government and Manigat
went into exile.
   The military government confirmed several people were detained
but gave no explanation for the roundup.
   The United States has protested the arrests and says at least
two detainees are U.S. citizens _ Roger Savain Jr., son of former
Information Minister Roger Savain Sr., and Robert Benodin, a top
Manigat adviser. The elder Savain also is detained.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said Thursday that Benodin's wife, Mireille,
and Manigat party officials Sandy William and Frantz Jean-Louis
also hold U.S. citizenship and are under detention.
   On Thursday, armed soldiers stood guard outside the sacked
headquarters of Manigat's Progressive National Democratic Rally
Party. The sidewalk was littered with desks, campaign posters and
broken glass.
   ``We saw him (Namphy) on television shaking his Uzi
(machinegun),'' said a 21-year-old maid, speaking on condition her
name not be used. ``People who don't understand aren't afraid.
People who do understand are.''
   Namphy headed a junta that governed Haiti for two years after
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France on Feb. 7, 1986.
Namphy turned over power last Feb. 7 to Manigat, who won
presidential elections in January with the army's help.
   Manigat dismissed Namphy as military commander June 17 in a
dispute over transfers of army officers and put him under house
arrest.
   Soldiers freed Namphy Sunday night, captured the National Palace
and sent Manigat into exile in the Dominican Republic, which shares
the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti. Manigat said he
would travel to Miami Friday and leave for Europe over the weekend.
   Journalists at Haitian radio stations say they fear a media
crackdown and will think twice before reporting controversial news.
   Haitians still remember the bloody reprisals of last summer,
when soldiers opened fire on unarmed anti-government demonstrators
and bystanders, killing more than 100 people. Thugs killed at least
34 people during presidential elections last Nov. 29, which were
aborted to stop the violence.
   ``Namphy has shown us what he can do, so what will happen is no
mystery,'' said Lucille, a hairdresser who spoke on condition she
not be fully identified.
   Businessmen fear the army's latest takeover will provoke more
capital flight and disinvestment by foreign assembly plants, which
employ more than 40,000 Haitians.
   ``I think things can only get worse now,'' said a wholesale
businessman who imports canned goods, dried fish and other
foodstuffs. ``For two years he (Namphy) didn't do any good for the
country. I think people have lost all hope of betterment. There is
no more democracy, no more progress, no more Constitution.''

<TEXT>
   A black man who tried to aid a white woman on a
Queens street early Thursday was assaulted by at least three white
men, who screamed racial slurs as they pummelled him with sticks
and their fists, police said.
   It was the second racial attack in the city in two days.
   Gregory Frederique, 25, was treated for cuts and bruises at a
hospital, and one of his alleged assailants was later arrested. At
least two other men were being sought.
   Frederique, reached by telephone at his home, refused to comment
on the incident.
   It occurred one day after a black man walking home from work on
Staten Island was attacked by six white men. He was defended by two
white men at a pizzeria where he sought aid.
   Investigators said Frederique was riding his bike home from
visiting his girlfriend at 2:30 a.m. when he saw a white woman
arguing with a white man in front of a bar in Astoria.
   The white man walked away and Frederique approached the white
woman. ``Basically, he was offering her assistance,'' said Capt.
Maurice Collins of the police Bias Unit.
   Two white men standing across the street threw a bottle at the
black man, began screaming racial slurs at Frederique and yelled
``you don't belong here,'' Collins said.
   The men began pushing and shoving Frederique, until he remounted
his bike to escape. The men, and at least one other companion,
followed Frederique in a car and tried to run him off the road.
   They caught up with him, left their car and began beating the
bicyclist with sticks and their fists. Frederique abandoned his
bike, and picked up a garbage can to defend himself, the captain
said.
   The victim escaped his assailants and ran about two blocks to a
gasoline station, where the attendant called police. Officers took
Frederique through the neighborhood and he was able to identify one
of his alleged assailants.
   Robin Tellier, 29, was charged with second-degree assault and
aggravated harassment, Collins said.
   In Wednesday's incident on Staten Island, the six alleged
assailants were arrested and charged with assault.
   Reports of bias incidents have decreased in the borough of
Queens in 1988, compared to 1987, but are on the rise citywide,
Collins said.
   There were 69 bias incidents reported in Queens from January
1988 to May 31, 1988, down from 85 such incidents during the same
period in 1987. However, as of May 31 of this year, 243 bias
incidents were reported in the five boroughs, an increase over the
217 incidents reported in 1987.

   A bank robber turned jailhouse journalist
was released Thursday from solitary confinement, where he was put
after reporting the federal prison where he is an inmate had become
a ``caldron of fear, hatred and violence.''
   Dannie M. Martin, 48, was released from the isolation unit at
Lompoc federal penitentiary in Southern California where he was
placed Wednesday ``for his own protection,'' said Warden R. H.
Rison.
   Rison said the article in Sunday's edition of the San Francisco
Chronicle-Examiner, which accused him of a ``gulag mentality,''
created ``a degree of tension in the prison's inmate population''
and required segregating the inmate-writer until an investigation
was completed.
   ``I could care less about criticism of this administration,''
said Rison. ``But I have had inmates say that Martin is not their
spokesman, and I'm obligated to make sure he doesn't get himself
hurt. He walks around here rather freely.''
   The article had the potential to set off a riot, Rison said.
   Associate Warden Paul Hofer said an investigation found no
threat to Martin. ``There was some grumbling about the article, but
it was not significant enough to keep Dannie in confinement,'' said
Hofer.
   While he still was held in the 120-man isolation ward at the
maximum-security prison, Martin said in a telephone interview
arranged by Rison that he was confined in retaliation for his
article.
   ``There is really no threat to my safety,'' said Martin, who has
written 20 articles for the San Francisco newspaper's Sunday Punch
section in the last two years.
   ``I haven't encouraged any group demonstration. I just depict
things as they are ... As long as my articles have veracity, I
should be allowed to depict people. The public is entitled to a
viewpoint other than the stereotype put out by the Bureau of
Prisons.''
   Rison said that unless the newspaper allows him to tell his side
in print, he will transfer Martin to another federal prison rather
than risk anger among the inmates.
   ``It is obvious from the prison officials' comments that they
are angry about the content of an article in the Chronicle,'' said
Peter Sussman, editor of the Sunday Punch section. ``If Dannie
Martin is being punished for that reason, it is a serious violation
of the First Amendment.''
   The Sunday Punch section publishes feature stories and opinion
columns, such as Martin's, Sussman said.
   Rison has never called the newspaper asking to comment, but the
newspaper would be willing to grant him space, Sussman said.
   In his articles, Martin ``has never attempted to glamorize or
apologize for the criminal,'' said Sussman.
   ``In the 20 or so articles Dannie has contributed to this
section, I have found him to be a sensitive observer and a fresh,
powerful writer with a deep commitment to justice,'' he said.

   Otto the gorilla, a top attraction at Lincoln
Park Zoo, died Thursday of an unknown cause. He was 24.
   Most gorillas in captivity live well into their 30s, said Carol
Leifer, a zoo spokeswoman. ``He could have lived longer,'' she
said, ``and we had certainly hoped that he would. He was in no way
an elderly creature.''
   His body was found by a zookeeper in an area out of public view.
   Lester Fisher, director of the zoo, said the cause of death
would not be certain until an autopsy, but a heart attack or stroke
were possible.
   ``His many thousands of friends will be as saddened as I am by
Otto's death,'' Fisher said.
   More than 100,000 people saw Otto since he first came to the zoo
in the mid-1960s, Ms. Leifer said. He sired 11 offspring and had
three grandchildren.

   President Francois Mitterrand reappointed Socialist
Premier Michel Rocard on Thursday and asked him to form a new
Cabinet.
   Mitterrand put off renaming Rocard, who resigned earlier this
month, so Rocard could vote Thursday for the Socialist candidate
for president of the National Assembly, Laurent Fabius.
   Fabius defeated the incumbent, Jacques Chaban-Delmas of the
neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, by 301-268. Eight
members of the 577-seat body either were absent or abstained.
   Rocard, 57, said Wednesday he would name a new government ``as
soon as possible'' but ``without haste,'' and political sources
said it could take place early next week.
   Rocard and the other members of the Cabinet formally resigned
two days after assembly elections June 12 in which neither the
Socialists nor the conservative coalition won a majority.
   Some centrist politicians have asked Mitterrand to form a
coalition government, but political analysts expected the new
Cabinet to resemble the previous one, largely made up of well-known
Socialist figures.

   Dennis Day, the Irish tenor best known as
Jack Benny's comic sidekick, was remembered Thursday as a loving
man devoted to helping himself and others battle Lou Gehrig's
disease.
   Day, whose trademarks were the line ``Gee, Mr. Benny'' and skits
in which he tricked the comedian into letting him unleash his
singing voice, died at 71 late Wednesday night at his Bel Air
Estates home.
   He had never fully recovered from a fall 3{ months ago, and
returned home after treatment this week at St. John's Hospital and
Health Center in Santa Monica. The cause of death was pneumonia,
said his mother-in-law, Margaret Almquist.
   ``I'm very, very saddened by Dennis' death,'' said comedian
Jerry Lewis, national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association, for which Day worked. ``He was a great friend _ to me
and to so many during his life. When he found out that he had ALS _
the disease that led inexorably to his death _ he put all the
remaining energy he had into helping MDA fight this tragic
disorder.''
   Doctors discovered last summer that Day had amyotropic lateral
sclerosis, the nerve disorder known as Lou Gehrig's disease that
causes gradual loss of muscle control. He injured his head in the
fall March 9 and had been hospitalized more than four weeks since
then, at times in critical condition.
   Day's wife and Mrs. Almquist's daughter, Peggy Margaret McNulty,
was admitted to St. John's on Wednesday for cardiac tests and was
in fair condition Thursday, hospital spokesman Armen Markarian
said. He added that doctors had not determined whether she suffered
a heart attack.
   Day played a dimwitted stooge on Benny's radio and TV variety
shows, but he was shrewd in his contract maneuvering with studios
and networks.
   ``I'm sorry about Dennis. I thought he was one of a kind,'' said
Milton Berle, who knew Day for 40 years. ``Through the tutorage of
my pal, Jack Benny, he became a very good foil and straight man
character for Jack. Show business is going to miss him.''
   ``He was a great actor and great comedian and a great foil for
Jack Benny. He was the crazy kid who did the silly things. They got
along very well together,'' said Irving Fein, Benny's former
manager who now manages George Burns.
   Day was also recalled as a family man who chose to spend time
with his 10 children rather than running with a Hollywood crowd.
   ``Warm, wonderful, loving, caring, always giving,'' is how
actress Ann Blyth remembered her brother-in-law. The star of
``Mildred Pierce,'' ``Kismet'' and ``The Helen Morgan Story'' is
married to Day's brother, James McNulty, and recalled the large
family get-togethers with their five children and Day's 10.
   ``Our family get-togethers were indeed warm and wonderful
memories to have,'' Miss Blyth said. ``To lose someone so dear is
indeed a great loss, but when you have lovely memories, it somehow
makes it easier.''
   ``Americans couldn't do any better for the likes of a role-model
husband and father than Dennis Day,'' added Ralph Edwards, host of
the old ``This is Your Life'' and ``Truth or Consequences'' shows.
   Born Owen Patrick McNulty to Irish parents in New York City on
May 21, 1917, he was graduated from St. Patrick's Cathedral High
School and attended Manhattan College with plans to enter Fordham's
law school.
   But then he learned Benny needed a singer to replace Kenny
Baker. A recording Day had made earned him an audition, and an
off-the-cuff wisecrack helped land him the job.
   He assumed the name Dennis Day when he joined Benny's radio show
as a singer in 1939.
   ``Gee, Mr. Benny!'' became a trademark line on Benny's radio and
TV variety shows. The remark came from Day when a skit situation
seemed to overwhelm him.
   Besides his success as a foil, Day gained popularity as an Irish
tenor with his renditions of ``Danny Boy,'' ``McNamara's Band,''
``Clancy Lowered the Boom,'' and other ballads. Another Day
favorite, ``Peg of my Heart'' was a ballad he sang for his wife.
   Benny and Day began appearing on TV in 1950, and in 1951 Day
landed a movie contract with 20th-Century Fox. At the time, he was
the only Fox contract player with television rights. He also signed
a contract with NBC, after allowing weeks of bidding between the
network and competitor CBS.
   Day is survived by his wife, a brother, six sons, four
daughters, and 13 grandchildren. Funeral services are planned next
week, depending on Mrs. McNulty's health.

<HEAD>China Denies Reports of Asylum for Pol Pot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry on Thursday denied reports
out of Washington that China agreed to help solve the Cambodian
conflict by offering asylum to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.
   Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing, said a
Washington Post article last week saying China would give refuge to
Pol Pot was ``highly irresponsible. ... Such a report is absolutely
groundless.''
   Li also denied China is ready to accept a Cambodian government
without the Khmer Rouge, the communist faction it backs with arms
and supplies.
   ``We favor a four-party coalition of Kampuchea (Cambodia) under
the leadership of Prince (Norodom) Sihanouk. We are not in favor of
any single party taking power nor are we in favor of exclusion of
any other party,'' Li said.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday
that China signaled in private its backing for a Cambodian
government without the Khmer Rouge, which launched a reign of
terror during its 1975-78 rule, during which more than a million
people died.
   China and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
support a three-party resistance coalition led by Sihanouk and
including the Khmer Rouge.
   The resistance is calling for the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops that have occupied Cambodia since late 1978 and the forming
of a four-party government including the Vietnam-backed faction
holding the capital of Phnom Penh.
   Little is known of the current activities of Pol Pot, the Khmer
Rouge leader during the 1975-78 bloodbath, but both ASEAN and
Vietnam have expressed concern that the Khmer Rouge might regain
power after Vietnam withdraws and Pol Pot and other fanatic
leftists might re-emerge.
   Asked if China supports Indonesia's plans to host informal
``cocktail party'' talks in Jakarta next month that will for the
first time bring together the rival factions in Cambodia, Li said,
``it is worth giving it a try.''
   He said China supports all efforts by ASEAN countries for a
``fair and reasonable settlement'' to the Cambodian question,
adding that China believes the rapid withdrawal of all Vietnamese
troops is the key to any settlement.
   He criticized Vietnam's statements that it will pull out 50,000
of its 120,000 troops this year and leave Cambodia by 1990 or 1991,
saying the timetable was too slow.
   ``This only shows that up to now, Vietnam has no sincerity to
settle the question of Kampuchea,'' he said.
   Li said that in the past, Vietnam's proclaimed withdrawals
turned out to be mere troop rotations. ``People are entitled to
call for strict international supervision and on-the-spot
verification of the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from
Kampuchea.''

   Leonard Matlovich, who died from AIDS at
age 44, was remembered Thursday for his 13-year battle against gay
stereotypes, beginning with his discharge from the Air Force for
declaring his homosexuality.
   ``He saw the gay rights struggles of the 1980s as the equivalent
of black civil rights struggles of the '50s and '60s,'' said Mike
Erickson, former owner of a California radio station where
Matlovich conducted a weekly talk show.
   Matlovich, who waged a public battle against the Air Force after
he was discharged for homosexuality in 1975, died Wednesday night
friend in Hollywood, where he had moved in April from San
Francisco, said friend Michael Bedwell.
   Matlovich died peacefully in the presence of relatives and
friends. The former technical sergeant was diagnosed with AIDS in
1986.
   ``Leonard Matlovich, more than anyone I have ever met, was
someone who was so admired that wherever he was people would come
up to him and say how he had changed their lives with his courage
to admit that he was gay,'' said Ken McPherson, a gay rights
activist in San Francisco.
   Matlovich won the Bronze Star and Purple Heart during the
Vietnam war. Erickson said Matlovich told him one of the medals was
awarded after he killed two Viet Cong soldiers while on sentry duty.
   Matlovich's declaration of homosexuality spurred the then
fledgling gay rights movement, which made his fight a cause
celebre. Matlovich was pictured on the cover of Time magazine in
1975, next to the words, ``I am a homosexual.''
   The Air Force responded by giving him a general discharge, but
Matlovich filed suit and in 1980 received an honorable discharge
and a $160,000 settlement.

   Gerard T. Indelicato, a former education adviser
to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis facing sentencing on federal fraud and
conspiracy charges, was named Thursday in state indictments
accusing him of larceny and forgery.
   Indelicato, 42, is due for sentencing July 8 after pleading
guilty to separate federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.
   The newest charges that date from his term as Dukakis' special
assistant for educational affairs from 1983-86 and his term as
president of Bridgewater State College from 1986 until his
resignation in December.
   In a prepared statement, Dukakis said the charges were the
result of a probe by the State Office of Investigation that Dukakis
himself requested last November.
   ``The criminal charges against Gerard Indelicato are very
serious _ more so because they allege a violation of the public
trust. I expect every public official who works for the
commonwealth to meet the highest standards of integrity,'' Dukakis
said.
   The new state charges against Indelicato were included in
indictments returned by separate grand juries sitting in Suffolk
and Plymouth counties.
   The five indictments released in Boston charge Indelicato of
Norwood with seven counts of violating the state
conflict-of-interest law, seven counts of larceny, 13 counts of
forgery, two counts of submitting false documents to a state
agency, three counts of filing false state income tax returns and
violations of Massachusetts fraud law.
   The Plymouth County indictments, covering Indelicato's actions
as Bridgewater president, include three counts of larceny, five
counts of forgery and one conflict charge.
   He is to be arraigned in Suffolk County on July 5 and in
Plymouth County on July 6.
   Indelicato's attorney, Morris Goldings, did not immediately
return a reporter's telephone call.
   The Suffolk County charges allege that Indelicato, while a
public official, had a financial interest in state contracts
awarded by the state, by Southeastern Massachusetts University and
the University of Lowell.
   In the Plymouth County indictments, Indelicato is charged with
forging the deed and other documents on land owned by the
Bridgewater State College Foundation, where Indelicato was building
a house.
   The other larceny counts relate to Indelicato's alleged misuse
of the foundation's funds, and the conflict charge relates to a
$7,500 payment from the foundation to Administrative Associates, in
which Indelicato had a financial interest.
   If convicted, Indelicato faces maximum penalties of 10 years in
state prison on each of the 13 forgery counts, five years in prison
and a fine of $25,000 on the larceny charges, five years in prison
and a fine of $10,000 on the fraud counts, two years in prison and
a $3,000 fine on the conflict counts and three years and a $100,000
fine on the tax charges.
   Indelicato pleaded guilty in federal court in April on charges
of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, perjury and making
false statements on tax returns between 1979 and 1983, before he
became a top Dukakis aide.
   The prosecution plans to recommend Indelicato serve 5 years in
prison and pay restitution of up to $80,000 for money siphoned out
of an adult education program through fraudulent billing, phony
employees and embezzled checks.
   Three co-codefendants in the federal case pleaded guilty to a
variety of charges.

   The post office in this sleepy
delta town is one of the three smallest in the nation, but it still
gets the postmaster's stamp of approval for being an interesting
place to work.
   Birds Landing tied with Salvo, N.C., and Ocholpee, Fla., in a
contest to determine the smallest post office. The winners beat out
such places as Cut and Shoot, Texas; Smile, Ky.; and Remote, Alaska.
   Using a point system, the post offices were compared in such
categories as square footage, local population, number of post
office boxes and number of delivery route stops. The contest began
with officials at the Postal Service's Oakland division, which
includes Birds Landing.
   Handling mail for the 24 people of Birds Landing, about 4 miles
from the Sacramento River, and about 100 families in the
surrounding countryside doesn't sound like a high-pressure job, but
Shirley Paolini, who has been postmaster for 20 years, said:
   ``For me, it's never boring. It can be anything else, but it's
never boring. You never know what the day is going to bring.''

   Someone with a sense of fowl play
keeps stealing the city's duck crossing signs, so street officials
have decided to sell the yello caution signs to pay the bills.
   The duck silhouette on a diamond-shaped sign is supposed to warn
motorists to watch for ducks crossing the street near a
neighborhood park pond.
   Since first installing the caution signs about two years ago,
the city has put up about 20 of the signs. All have disappeared.
   At $75 apiece, the street department is out $1,500 for the
signs, said Garold Young of the town's streets department. He said
officials figure the missing signs have become wall hangings in
dormitories and bedrooms.
   Officials decided last week they would bow to market demand and
offer the signs for sale at $28 to $35 apiece.
   ``I don't know if it will do any good but we thought we would
try to sell them,'' Young said. ``We are not here to make a profit.
The people in the area want the ducks protected.''

   A study published today shows that the acne
medicine Accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin
cancer in humans, but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for
routine use.
   Accutane, a vitamin A derivative that can cause birth defects in
pregnant women, sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of
people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited
genetic disorder, the study shows.
   While Accutane cannot be taken for long periods by most people,
other synthetic forms of vitamin A may someday be routinely used to
prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years
of exposure to the sun, the researchers said.
   In addition, vitamin A drugs may someday be used to treat other
tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the lung, stomach,
colon, bladder, cervix and breast, said Dr. Harley Haynes of
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   ``The odds are that within the lifetime of many people, we may
well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer
in high-risk people,'' he said.

   A familiar ingredient was missing from this
week's economic summit in Toronto: No one did any Japan-bashing.
   Unlike past summits when the Japanese sat quietly on the
sidelines and other countries complained of surging trade deficits,
Toronto was more like a corporate board meeting with Japan an equal
partner.
   ``Statistics talked on our behalf,'' explained Michihiko
Kunihiro, chief cabinet counselor on foreign affairs.
   He was referring to three inter-related developments in Japan's
economy.
   Over the last three years, the value of the yen has doubled
against the dollar, making Japanese exports more expensive and
American imports cheaper. Second, Japan has agreed it needs to
develop its domestic market and thus increase its import. Most
important, the island nation has promised to work for a gradual
narrowing of its record trade surpluses.
   The performance of the Japanese economy led several summit
partners to compliment Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
making his debut at the annual gatherings.

   A congressional committee is due in
West Virginia this week to investigate hunger in Appalachia, but a
debate already has begun over whether there's an ``underground''
army of starving people in the state.
   ``We are looking for declining food security in Appalachia,
where studies show the poor are getting poorer,'' said Timmie
Jensen, a staff worker for the U.S. House Select Committee On
Hunger.
   West Virginia was selected because all 55 counties of the
coal-mining state qualify as part of Appalachia, a committee
spokesman said. No other state bears that distinction.
   The committee plans hearings in Montgomery on Friday to listen
to food bank workers, community advocates and state welfare
officials talk about whether West Virginia's poor are being fed. A
few congressmen, led by Rep. Harley Staggers, D-W.Va., also will
visit the homes of three needy residents to hear their problems.

   A civic group has taken a novel approach
to supporting its local police by taking out a $1 million insurance
policy to cover the township's eight officers if they are killed in
the line of duty.
   The insurance idea came up after the deaths of two Will County
auxiliary deputies during a 1983 crime spree in Homer Township,
said James Clarage, president of the Homer Men for Responsible
Government.
   ``We really felt bad about what happened with that incident,''
Clarage said. ``There's nothing you can really do to offset
something like that. This was just something we felt obligated to
do to show that we were concerned.''
   In any future tragedy, he said, ``We wanted to make sure that it
wouldn't cause hardship ... to the families of officers.''
   The coverage, presented Wednesday to Will County Sheriff John
Johnsen, would provide up to $200,000 for families of each officer
killed and up to $1 million total. The policy took effect March 1.

   The song of the sea is still music

144 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a disabled boat.

families.''
   The five, headed by skipper Gerardo Obregon, 33, received a
hero's welcome Wednesday from dozens of people including first lady
Margarita de Arias when they flew in from Honolulu by way of Los
Angeles.
   Relatives, friends, neighbors and fellow ``pescadores'' flocked
in from Puntarenas, their home port 95 miles away, to welcome them
at San Jose's Santamaria Airport.
   The engine of their 33-foot fishing vessel, the Cairo III, was
knocked out beyond repair during a storm Jan. 24, five days after
they sailed out of Puntarenas, leaving them adrift in the Pacific.

   When Larry Mundth went to market to sell his livestock, he knew
all about the drought outside. But he wasn't quite ready for the
flood inside.
   Cattle filled the Milwaukee Stockyards, where Mundth and other
anxious farmers gathered to sell their animals in what has become
another casualty of the Midwest's worst drought in 50 years.
   Business is booming at stockyards and auction barns across the
heartland as farmers, faced with hay shortages and rising feed
prices, are liquidating their herds. The selling frenzy, meanwhile,

   The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.6 percent
rate in the first three months of 1988, prompting the Reagan
administration on Thursday to make what was once considered a
too-rosy forecast even rosier.
   After the October stock market collapse, many private economists
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year. They criticized
as unrealistic White House projections saying the economy, as
measured by the gross national product, would grow at a steady 2.9
percent pace, the same as in 1986 and 1987.
   But booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and
continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise
their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began
looking pessimistic.

   Two studies of key cells in the inner ear of
birds suggest a possibility of developing therapy to correct
deafness in people, such as President Reagan, caused by exposure to
loud noises.
   In companion studies published Friday in the journal Science,
teams of researchers report that after exposure to traumatic levels
of noise both adult quails and young chickens are able to regrow
damaged cells that are essential to hearing. The studies suggest
that there is a hormone or protein secreted by the damaged cells
that causes a growth of the new, replacement cells.
   ``This is a truly new finding,'' said Edward W. Rubel of the
University of Washington, co-author of a study using adult quail.
``We have not found a cure for deafness, but we have found
something in the ear of birds that we haven't before thought

Dr. Ruth Westheimer, actor Chuck Norris, singers Meatloaf and
Johnny Cash and Jerry Mathers as ``the Beaver.''
   Sports figures won't be ignored. John Madden and Bob Uecker have
been booked, and Costas hopes to get Sugar Ray Leonard and Bobby
Knight on the show, too.
   ``If we do get sports figures, it would be because the interest
in them transcends sports fans,'' Costas said.
   ``We're going to get a really good cross-section of people that
I think will appeal to viewers that have watched the Letterman
show. We hope we can keep some of the people that are watching
Letterman at 1:30 and pick up some strays. You know, milkmen who
are getting ready to go to work, precocious paper boys.''
   Meanwhile, Costas is one in a series of fill-ins for ``Today''
co-host Bryant Gumbel, who is off getting ready for his duties as
anchor of the network's coverage of the Summer Olympics. Costas
will go to the Olympics, too, and appear on a wrap-up that will
pre-empt the NBC late-night schedule, including his own show.
   It has been widely speculated that Gumbel won't want to return
to the early-morning grind after his high-profile stint in prime
time. So Costas, along with other guest hosts, has been presumed
under consideration to replace him.
   Costas' predecessors in the recent host-of-the-week series have
included Phil Donahue, Tom Snyder and Jim Lehrer. All three are
consummate professionals in their element, but only Snyder seemed
comfortable with the ``Today'' format.
   Costas dismisses speculation about the ``Today'' slot but avoids
issuing an unequivocal rejection of the idea.
   ``I think the thing that no reasonably intelligent person would
say _ `No I'll never do that.' Stupid thing to say. But is it
something I'm thinking about doing, something that concerns me,
something I'm pointing toward doing? Absolutely not.''
   How well he does next week notwithstanding, Costas is considered
to have star potential by NBC, whose talk-show king, Johnny Carson,
is approaching retirement age.
   And the cushy schedule of ``Later'' would be hard for Costas to
give up. The show is taped one day a week, then he's free to
continue his first love, covering baseball. And if the show is
successful and is picked up beyond the current 26-show commitment,
Costas will move it for the summer to St. Louis, his hometown. A
``Today'' job would require him to be in New York almost all the
time.
   ``I'm well aware that some very substantial people in this
business have done that (``Today'') job, and even to be mentioned
in connection with it is flattering and an honor, et cetera, et
cetera,'' Costas said.
   ``However, I think the most important thing that someone should
do is do what makes them happy, not fulfill somebody else's idea of
what the next highest-ranking job is and what the next step up the
ladder is and what your next ambition should be.
   ``My ambition is to do a good job at what I do and to be happy.
And I'm very, very, very happy anytime I'm at a baseball game.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   `SATURDAY NIGHT' REVIVE _ The entire cast of NBC's ``Saturday
Night Live,'' the first to win major kudos since the originals,
will be back for a third year when the show begins its new season
Oct. 8, says NBC. ...
   WHEW! `FAMILY FEUD' IS BACK _ Everybody who's been getting along
so well out there, get set to take up fussin' and a-fightin' again.
``Family Feud'' is coming back on the air, appropriately enough on
the Fourth of July, after a three-year absence _ but this time
without host Richard Dawson and without network ABC. The new host
is standup comic Ray Combs. The new network is CBS. Dawson,
meanwhile, is supposed to become the host of a new version of ``You
Bet Your Life'' on NBC. Whose shoes would you rather try to fill?
Richard Dawson's or Groucho Marx's?

<DATELINE>SPENCERS WOOD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Cook worries that the
rolling green countryside of Spencers Wood is endangered, that
throngs from London 35 miles to the east will pour into tracts of
houses where now there are trees and meadows.
   He heads a group of 450 local residents opposing the
suburbanization of their countryside in Spencers Wood and all of
Berkshire county where tiny villages are designated by the
government as the sites for thousands of new homes for people
overflowing from crowded London.
   The battle of Berkshire is a test case in a political
controversy brewing across southern England, where the Green Belt,
a ring of protected land around London, has put housing-development
pressure on more outlying rural areas like Spencers Wood.
   ``Once the atmosphere goes, it's no longer country living, so to
speak,'' said Cook as he surveyed smokestacks and a sea of
rowhouses on one side of the highway running through the area and
the green land on the other.
   The issue touches sensitive political nerves.
   Critics, even in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party, say that by funneling development to the wealthy southern
England, the government is ignoring the economically ailing north
and widening national divisions.
   Environment Minister Nicholas Ridley and developers argue that
houses must be built where they are needed, and that's in the
south. They maintain that denying free-market forces, a cornerstone
of Mrs. Thatcher's policies, would dampen southern growth.
   ``This issue is potentially as explosive for the Tories
(Conservatives) as any that has caused rumblings of discontent
within their ranks during the past decade,'' commented the
Financial Times.
   At the heart of the controversy is the Green Belt, the 1.2
million acres set aside 50 years ago around London to keep the city
from sprawling to the sea, give it a ``green lung,'' and preserve
the city's character. Belts around other cities followed and Green
Belts now cover 14 percent of England.
   As part of her goal of transforming Britain into ``a
property-owning democracy,'' Mrs. Thatcher wants everyone to have
the chance to buy a home. But she could not touch the Green Belts
without alienating large numbers of voters in the south, her
electoral heartland.
   The planned Channel Tunnel linking southern England to France
and the growth of London as a financial capital have sent real
estate prices soaring and added greater burdens on hospitals and
other services.
   Opponents like Harry Cook say it's fine to protect the Green
Belts, but unfair to make the countryside pay the price. They say
inner cities should be revitalized with new housing.
   ``We think it's bad management for Britain's inner cities to be
depopulating and green fields to be built over,'' said Jerry
Wiggin, a lawmaker who opposes his Conservative Party's development
policy.
   Richard Bate, senior planner for the 60-year-old Council for the
Protection of Rural England (CPRE), says: ``If we continue to have
major housebuilding and investment in the southeast and not in
other parts of the country, the problem of two nations under one
government is going to become even greater than it already is.''
   Ridley argues that city dwellers ``need parks and green spaces
and gardens, too, and resent the implication that all development
can just be dumped in their backyard.''
   The controversy heated up in February after Ridley increased
estimates of southeast housing needs from 460,000 homes to a
possible 610,000 by the year 2000.
   ``We've taken (Berkshire) as a test case because it is the
county under the greatest pressure,'' the CPRE's Bate said in an
interview. ``It's an area which has seen a doubling of its housing
stock in the last 30 years, where villages have already been
absorbed into main towns.''
   A right-wing think tank, the Adam Smith Institute, has suggested
reviving Green Belt land that was once used for industry and fell
derelict after the conservation area was introduced.
   It says up to 40 percent of the belt consists of such ``brown''
patches and proposes letting developers in provided they also make
other spoiled areas ``green'' again.
   Harry Cook and his neighbors, in the meantime, worry about what
they will lose.
   Small developments already peek from behind the trees and old
homes of their region.
   London already has encroached.

   After $4.9 million worth of renovations to
bring the White House of the Confederacy to its Civil War-time
stateliness, restorers are welcoming visitors again to ``the
executive mansion of another nation.''
   The house, built in 1818, was leased to the Confederate
government for use as the residence of President Jefferson Davis,
and in it he often mapped war strategy with his generals, including
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson.
   It gives a glimpse into the life of the South's first family
while reflecting the decline and death of the Confederate States of
America.
   ``As the war went on, the quality of what was served went
down,'' said David S. Bundy, director of development and public
relations at the house and the Museum of the Confederacy next door.
   By the end of the Civil War, he said, the White House was
serving ``what became known as Jefferson Davis punch _ water.''
   Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, had bought the house
for $42,000 in 1861.
   Three decades after the war, in 1896, it opened as the
Confederate Museum but closed in 1976 when its Confederate
collections were moved to the new museum. Its restoration and
reopening this month were underwritten by $4.9 million in private,
corporate, state and federal donations.
   ``We feel like the White House is one of the most important
historical houses in America,'' Bundy said. ``It was the executive
mansion of another nation. Whether you're from the North or the
South, it played a big part in our destiny.''
   The three-story Classical Revival-style White House, actually
painted a pale gray, stands in the heart of the city's historic
Court End district.
   Visitors can tread on a re-creation of the white carpet on which
Lee inadvertently tracked mud. Restorers learned the carpet was
white from a reference Davis' wife, Varina, made to the incident.
   ``General Lee came up from camp one day evidently worn out and
worried, to find Mr. Davis lying quite ill on a divan, in a little
morning-room in which we received only our intimate friends,'' Mrs.
Davis recalled in her memoirs. ``General Lee, with a bow and excuse
for coming in on the white carpet with his splashed boots, sat down
and plunged at once into army matters.''
   Visitors also can see the second-floor office where Davis met
with Lee and Jackson to discuss strategy and the front parlor where
Davis entertained the public, Bundy said.
   Authenticity was important to those restoring the house. The
only non-period pieces in sight are smoke alarms.
   Most of the furniture in the house was used by the Davises in
the four years they lived there and was donated to the restoration
effort. A painted floor cloth in the round entranceway ``was very
trendy at the time.''
   ``Anything that's not a Davis piece is of the period,'' Bundy
said.
   Most of the gaslight chandeliers in the house are original and
have been restored. ``We could have used substitutes, and 99
percent of the public never would have known,'' he said.
   Restorers analyzed the paint on the furniture to determine which
coat was on top when Davis lived in the house.
   Reproducing textiles throughout the house cost ``quite a bit
over'' $100,000, Bundy said.
   A New York textile reproduction company created a green and gold
silk for the drapes and an ottoman in the dining room that is
almost identical to the fabric in place 123 years ago.
   ``We have these original fabrics. These are pieces of history.
If we can recreate them, we make every effort,'' Bundy said.
   It was painstaking work, copying the original design on graph
paper, dying yarn to match the original colors and hand-tying
15,000 threads individually to a loom, said Adriana Bitter, one of
the owners of Scalamandre, a restoration consultant in New York
City.
   The silk left the loom at a rate of only 4{ yards in an 8-hour
workday, she said. The pattern still is not an exact copy because
the patterns in the new fabric do not repeat at the same rate, Mrs.
Bitter said. It could have been done for another $30,000.
   Restorers discovered the house had one more room than previously
thought _ a secretary's office adjacent to Davis'. They found a
joint that indicated where a wall had once been.
   Among furniture and other items that Davis and his family used
are his office chair and desk.
   Many other items left in the pockets of Northern soldiers while
the house was being used as Union Army headquarters after the war.
   ``A lot of Union officers took souvenirs from the house and a
lot of them have found their way back,'' Bundy said. Many were
returned when the museum first opened in the house at the turn of
the century. Others, such as spurs Davis wore, have come back
within the last month.

   Discarded plastic, already blamed for the deaths
of hundreds of thousands of birds and fish in the oceans and along
seashores, is spreading to the Great Lakes.
   The virtually indestructible material is becoming not just an
eyesore but a potential threat to wildlife in the world's largest
freshwater system, according to researchers and lay observers.
   Jim Mattis of Benzonia, Mich., has operated fishing charter
boats for 15 years in Lake Michigan. He said he's found plastic
debris floating up to 10 miles offshore, some of it in ``scum
lines'' of garbage a mile long.
   ``There's more plastic bags and pieces of Visquine (a trade name
for plastic sheeting) in the lake than I've ever seen,'' Mattis
said. ``It's gotten worse in the last three or four years.
   ``I've heard a lot of people say, `It's just a plastic bag.'
They don't realize the damage it can do.''
   Most legislation, research and enforcement has focused on a
different kind of Great Lakes pollution _ toxic chemicals that
threaten widespread areas and can be traced to specific sources.
   ``There're about 1,000 different types of hazardous substances
that are known to exist in the Great Lakes,'' said Cameron Davis, a
research analyst with the Chicago-based Lake Michigan Federation.
``Right now, toxics (and) contaminated sediments are the No. 1
thing.''
   Plastic pollution is less fully understood, although its
potential for harm is clear. A single shard of plastic sheeting,
six-pack beverage carrier or strand of fishing line can float
undetected until it strangles fish or birds, binds a boat propeller
or jams an engine intake.
   ``We see the pictures every year; we know it happens,'' said
Glen Dudderar, a Michigan State University biologist. ``But we
don't have any research on to what extent.''
   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources estimated that one
bird in 100 observed by biologists was entangled in plastic fishing
line, according to a 1987 report by the Washington-based Center for
Environmental Education. Entanglement can also mean ingestion of
the plastic.
   Little is known, too, about another synthetic material
intentionally put into the lakes: fishing nets that are loosed
accidentally, but continue trapping their prey.
   ``Ghost fishing'' has been documented mainly along the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts. But it also occurs in Great Lakes waters where
gill-net fishing is done, either by state-regulated commercial
interests or by Indians working under terms of federal treaties,
officials said.
   ``From the fisheries' standpoint, the worst thing we've got is
gill nets that break away,'' said Asa Wright, manager of the Great
Lakes Program of the state DNR's Fisheries Division.
   Just last month, authorities retrieved a gill net containing
more than 600 pounds of rotting lake trout. The 1,000-foot-long,
44-inch-wide net probably had been adrift several months in
southern Lake Superior, investigators said.
   Bill Eger, a biologist who works with Michigan's Indian
fishermen, said gill nets occasionally are abandoned or torn from
buoys in storms or by passing freighters.
   But the approximately 350 Indians who fish in the
treaty-protected waters of northwestern Lake Huron, northern Lake
Michigan and south central Lake Superior usually set and retrieve
their gill nets daily, Eger said.
   Since gill nets cost about $1 a yard, they're seldom abandoned,
he said. Those that aren't retrieved tend to ``ball up'' and sink,
bearing only the fish trapped on the first day or two after being
set, he said.
   ``It does not continue to catch fish at an exponential rate, as
Asa Wright would like to have you believe,'' Eger said.
   Charter skipper Mattis said plastic refuse poses a threat to
navigation.
   ``My son last year blew out an engine when a plastic bag got
sucked up in the intake,'' he said. ``I had a piece two years ago
... an 8-foot piece of Visquine that got around my prop. It
wouldn't come off, it knotted up so bad. Luckily a shaft didn't
break.''
   The governor has signed legislation that will make Michigan the
13th state _ and the second in the Great Lakes region after
Wisconsin _ to require that six-pack beverage carriers be made of
plastic material that degrades within 360 days of exposure to
sunlight. The bill awaits action in the state Senate.
   Enforcement of anti-dumping laws is isolated, conceded Capt.
Larry Murdock, chief of the Marine Safety Division of the U.S.
Coast Guard's district office in Cleveland.
   Disposal of solid waste anywhere in the Great Lakes has been
illegal for years, Murdock said. Freighters and other large
commercial vessels are required to store or incinerate their trash
rather than dump it overboard, a practice common among oceangoing
ships and blamed for at least part of the plastic pollution at sea.
   ``For the pleasure boaters, I don't think you're going to find
any enforcement,'' Murdock said. ``We haven't apprehended anyone.
... You're talking about an individual-type problem.''
   Department of Natural Resources biologists have estimated that
Michigan's recreational boaters produce up to 26,000 tons of
garbage a year. An unknown percentage of that total finds its way
into the lakes.
   The plastics industry has joined government and environmental
groups in conducting public education campaigns about plastic
pollution in the Great Lakes and oceans alike.
   Brochures describing the harm done to marine life by discarded
plastic, have been jointly distributed by the Center for
Environmental Education, the Marine Entanglement Research Program
of the National Marine Fisheries Service and The Society of the
Plastics Industry Inc., an industry group.
   The Fisheries Service and Defenders of Wildlife, another
Washington-based environmental group, have distributed similar
brochures encouraging boaters and beach visitors to dispose of
trash properly.
   Individuals can do the most to turn back the invasion of plastic
flotsam, said Tom Martin, director of Michigan's Office of the
Great Lakes: ``The absolute key thing is people's individual
responsibility, that it has consequences for the environment.''

   As they size up the outlook for the U.S. economy
at mid-1988, many analysts see good prospects for continued growth
over the next six months or so.
   There are several cloudy spots in their crystal balls, however,
thanks to some unusual trends and unfolding events that defy
measurement.
   The drought in the Farm Belt, for one, looms as a potential wild
card whose long-term economic implications cannot yet be gauged.
   In addition, there is the presidential election coming in
November, the outcome of which seems likely to affect in unknown
ways the continued progress of an economic expansion that will be
entering its seventh year about the time the voters go to the polls.
   Four years ago, many forecasters felt safe in assuming that
President Reagan would be re-elected and would make no dramatic
changes in economic policy. This time, there is widespread
uncertainty about which candidate will prevail and on what sort of
platform.
   By almost all accounts, the economy enters the second half of
the year in sounder shape than anyone dared hope last winter.
   Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, projects growth of the gross national product, after
adjustment for inflation at a 3.6 percent rate for all of 1988, up
from 2.9 percent last year.
   The economy, he said, ``is in transition from being led by the
1983-1986 consumer spending boom to being led in 1987-1989 by trade
and net exports.''
   The White House on Thursday revised its growth estimate for 1988
upward, to 3.5 percent from an earlier prediction of 2.9 percent.
   In the view of a good many analysts, continued improvement is
likely in the trade deficit, led by the export boom.
   ``It is now clear that the U.S. trade deficit is declining,''
said Robert Barbera at the investment firm of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   ``Material improvement in U.S. trade and a bottom for the U.S.
dollar are the most fundamental issues confronting U.S. and world
financial markets.''
   One big question that remains for the outlook is whether the
economy will reach the point where expansion turns into an
inflationary force.
   According to Straszheim, ``although growth seems secure for
1988, rising inflation and interest rates suggest the economy is
vulnerable to a modest recession in 1989.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Co. Economic Advisors
Inc., says the economy has entered ``the full employment zone''
where capacity of operating facilities and the labor force could
begin to show signs of strain.
   ``The problem for economic policies in the U.S. is to somehow
traverse the full employment zone without an unacceptable
acceleration of inflation and the instability that has always
created a turning point for the expansion and, then, a subsequent
recession,'' he asserts.
   If the drought in the Midwest continues much longer, analysts
say its effects could start to spread beyond the region and the
farm economy.
   Rising prices of basic commodities that become scarcer than
expected because of the drought naturally evoke visions of
increased inflation. However, some observers say the effect may
more complicated than that.
   As David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International, suggested: ``Over the next several months, rising
food prices are likely to absorb a growing portion of most people's
budgets, since food demand is generally insensitive to price.
   ``But this may serve to intensify consumer resistance to price
increases on other goods. Thus, unless income growth suddenly
accelerates, real consumer spending can be expected to remain
soft.''

<HEAD>How Johnson Administration Tried To Reverse Vietnam Opposition</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve million pages of Army documents dealing
with Vietnam were recently unsealed. Special Correspondent George
Esper, who covered the war for 10 years and was the last Saigon
bureau chief for The Associated Press, spent a week going through
some of the papers for this report.

   Secret documents recently declassified and
opened to public view confirm behind-the-scenes efforts by
President Lyndon B. Johnson and top military commanders to
manipulate American public opinion of the Vietnam War and reverse
growing opposition.
   In one memo, Vietnam commanders were told to ``make it clear to
all concerned that expressing criticism to news media
representatives and others will serve only to aggravate the issues
surrounding our problems in Southeast Asia.'' It was signed by Adm.
U.S. Grant Sharp, commander of American forces in the Pacific.
   Johnson himself was described in some messages as wanting to
play down military operations in 1968 so as not to upset efforts to
get the North Vietnamese to enter peace talks.
   The 12 million pages at the National Archives are one-sixth of
the 72 million pages of Army documents that will be released in
installments. The next batch will be released in April 1990.
   The papers' topics range from battlefield reports to a division
commander's concern that his troops were taking radios and comic
books to the front lines, making them less vigilant against Viet
Cong attack.
   But the most significant papers are the exchanges between Saigon
and Washington. While Johnson's sensitivity to criticism and his
administration's efforts to put the most favorable light on an
unpopular war were widely reported at the time, the papers provide
an inside view of official thinking.
   One particular message, signed by Gen. Earle G. Wheeler,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, illustrates the
administration's thrust. It was sent Jan. 31, 1968, at the start of
North Vietnam's Tet offensive, which began turning Americans
against their involvement in the distant war.
   In the memo, Gen. William C. Westmoreland was told that
President Johnson wanted him to make a brief personal comment to
the press at least once each day ``to convey to the American people
your confidence in our capability to blunt these enemy moves and to
reassure the public here that you have the situation under
control.''
   But even as Westmoreland received the memo, the situation was
chaotic, with North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops attacking more
than 100 cities and towns on the second day of their three-day
Lunar New Year, called Tet.
   They suffered heavy casualties but showed the vulnerability of
South Vietnam's cities, sending a message to Americans that no end
to the war was near. In the two weeks of the offensive, more than
1,000 Americans were killed, increasing frustration and dismay back
home.
   The papers also reveal that Johnson's decision two months later
to halt the bombing of North Vietnam in hopes of coaxing the enemy
to the peace table was instead taken by military officers as an
opportunity to lay low in bad weather and sway public opinion at
the same time.
   The president appeared on national television March 31, 1968, to
announce the cessation of bombing above the 20th Parallel. He then
stunned listeners when he added that he would neither seek nor
accept the Democratic nomination for a second term.
   In a memo dated the same day and apparently reflecting prior
knowledge of Johnson's announcement, Sharp, the Pacific commander,
pointed out to Westmoreland that the bombling halt was timed just
right.
   ``Since the Tet offensive, support in the U.S. for the war in
Southeast Asia has decreased at an accelerating rate,'' Sharp
wrote. ``Many of the strongest proponents of forceful action in
Vietnam have reversed their positions, have moved to neutral ground
or are wavering. If this trend continues unchecked, public support
of our objectives in Southeast Asia will be too frail to sustain
the effort.
   ``Weather over the northern portion of North Vietnam will
continue unsuitable for air operations during the next 30 days;
therefore if a cessation of air operations is to be undertaken, now
is the best time from the military viewpoint.
   ``It is hoped that this unilateral initiative to seek peace will
reverse the growing dissent and opposition within our country to
the war. The initiative will aid in countering foreign criticism.''
   In another March 31 message, Wheeler advised Westmoreland that
at a White House meeting that night, Johnson ``cited the fact that
we have been accused in the past of always accompanying peace
initiatives with increased military activity.''
   Wheeler said the president was aware of ongoing operations to
open Route 9 and lift the North Vietnamese siege of the American
base at Khe Sanh, one of the most widely reported campaigns of the
war.
   ``The purpose of this message is not to have you stand down
those operations,'' Wheeler told Westmoreland. ``However, it is
desired that you, your subordinate commanders and your PA (public
affairs) people play them low key. ... You and your people should
take care to describe these operations as being merely in the usual
run of offensive operations.''
   The battle to free Khe Sanh, however, was hardly ``usual.'' More
than 200 Marines were killed and 1,600 wounded in the 77-day siege,
which was lifted April 5.
   In the meantime, air strikes continued in the less populous
southern panhandle of North Vietnam, and the administration failed
to manipulate the press to its liking. When it was reported in
mid-April that U.S. bombers had launched the heaviest air strikes
of the war in the panhandle, Johnson was furious, prompting a cable
April 16 from Wheeler to Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford and
others, including Sharp and Westmoreland.
   ``Apparently, the president was considerably chafed by TV and
radio newscasts ... to effect that Johnson unleashed yesterday
heaviest air attacks of war against panhandle of NVN (North
Vietnam),'' Wheeler said. ``The president thinks we are handing a
case to those who profess that our actions are contrary to his 31
March speech by providing so much detail ... to the news media.''
   Sharp and Westmoreland suggested to Wheeler that if bombing were
to be renewed beyond the panhandle, their commands should decline
comment to the press. Responding on May 23, Wheeler said:
   ``As I advised you previously, the highest authority (Johnson)
desires the noise level to be kept low in such eventuality _ i.e,
no announcements to the press giving details of weight or effort,
targets struck, etc.
   ``I must say, Westy, that your proposal and the rationale behind
it make good sense: specifically, that you make no announcements
but be permitted to confirm that a particular target has been
struck if such question is asked.''
   The North Vietnamese did agree to peace talks, which opened in
Paris May 13, 1968. But it was almost five more years, on Jan. 27,
1973, until an agreement was reached ending U.S. intervention in
the war. American forces and prisoners of war returned home.
   The opposing Vietnamese sides ignored the agreement's call for a
cease-fire and continued fighting until Saigon fell to the North
Vietnamese on April 30, 1975.

   The Vietnam war's messengers of death are
inescapable at the National Archives.
   The daily journals, the annual history of the Da Nang mortuary,
the certificates of death, the records of things left behind _ a
peace medal, a Bible, tape cassettes _ are abundant in the 12
million pages of Army documents recently made public.
   Together, they chronicle the heavy toll paid by the 58,156 men
and women who died in Vietnam.
   The Da Nang mortuary report tells of processing the remains of
5,377 Americans in 1969 and notes that the number of casualties was
generally higher in March through May of each year because of
regular North Vietnamese and Viet Cong offensives.
   The second entry in the daily staff journal of the 74th Medical
Battalion at Chu Lai on June 8, 1969, brought the dreaded knock on
the door back home in Canton, Ohio, for Kay and John Lane.
   ``1. 0001 Journal opened.
   ``2. 0550 Rocket attack 312th area. Resulted in the death of a
nurse.
   ``3. 0720 SFC Bailey called SP5 Ellafrits, 312th Evac, on the
casualty report on the death of 1LT Sharon A. Lane, N2337551,
283-38-3327, 312th Evac, as a result of attack at 0550 hrs ...''
   While it was morning in Vietnam, it was the previous evening in
the United States because Saigon time was 11 hours ahead. The Lanes
heard sketchy details of the rocket attack on the evening news.
   ``Right after that came a knock on the door and we saw this Army
car sitting in the driveway,'' Kay Lane, now 64, recalled in a
telephone interview. ``When he (the Army officer) came to the door,
even before my husband got there, I said, `Is she dead?' He said,
`Yes.'''
   A piece of steel from a rocket that landed between Ward 4A and
Ward 4B of the 312th Evacuation Hospital had ripped through Sharon
Lane's aorta. She bled to death less than a month before her 26th
birthday, the first woman killed by hostile fire in Vietnam.
   Among her last letters home, she wrote on June 4, 1969, that her
unit had just reached a milestone by treating its 10,000th patient
since arriving in Vietnam the previous September. Then she added:
   ``Start `nights' tomorrow so don't have to get up early
tomorrow. Nice thought. Still very quiet around here. Haven't
gotten mortared for a couple of weeks now ...''
   Four days later, she was dead. She was posthumously awarded the
Bronze Star, the Purple Heart and the Vietnamese Gallantry Cross.
   A memorial statue of the nurse stands in the courtyard of
Aultman Hospital in Canton, where she went to nursing school. The
hospital's Sharon Lane Women's Center is named in her honor.
   Just the same, her mother said, Sharon would approve of none of
this.
   ``She wasn't that kind of a person,'' Kay Lane said. ``She just
thought she was a nobody, you know, just an ordinary person, and
everybody tries to make a hero out of her now.''

   Amid documents recording the battles,
decisions and agony of Vietnam, the war's lighter and slighter
moments were also dutifully noted in the 12 million pages of Army
papers recently opened to the public at the National Archives. Here
is a sampling.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   An infantry captain inquiring about the availability of
black-eyed peas was told by headquarters that this Southern
specialty was not on the Army's master menu. How could that be, he
asked, since one unit he knew of had several pallets of peas and
its supply officer had promised the division general, ``Yes,
general, the troops will have black-eyed peas for New Year's day.''
   Besides, the captain said, the black-eyed peas matter, as it was
termed in the papers, was of interest to the president of the
black-eyed pea industry as well as to Gen. William C. Westmoreland,
the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam and a South Carolina native.
   The captain was told that the peas in question were either
surplus from the commissary store or had been mistakenly unloaded
in Vietnam. The military log dated Jan. 2, 1968, reporting this
exchange, had this final entry:
   ACTION TAKEN
   None.

   Speaking of Westmoreland, when the king of Thailand learned the
general was planning a visit in May 1968, he invited the general
over to talk since Thai troops were serving with the allied forces
in Vietnam. But Mrs. Westmoreland, who was accompanying her
husband, was excluded. As the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy
in Bangkok explained in this cable to Westmoreland:
   ``We have learned from the king's chief aide-de-camp that his
majesty is looking forward to a rather lengthy serious discussion
of the war with you, and (his aide) expressed the view that `this
might be tiresome for the ladies.' Since I take this to be a clear
indication of the king's preference for a serious stag talk, I am
inclined to let it rest that way. Accordingly ... we have planned
the itinerary with this in view.''

   When Lt. Col. Melvin L. Abrams, an Army dentist stationed in
Saigon, was asked if he had any equipment problems, he was blunt:
   ``I had some jackass come over from the States. The clinic was a
hootch, bamboo sides, canvas, too. ... He came in and looked at the
X-ray machine and he told me I could not use it because we did not
have a lead screen.
   ``I told him, `You see my name.' I had my name on my uniform and
I said, `I set that X-ray machine up. ... I get people sent in here
from all over the country to get an X-ray taken. I am going to
continue using it and you can put that in your report.' ... I never
heard any further.''

<HEAD>Rival Teachers Unions Differ on Approach to School Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's rival teacher unions are heading
to their conventions with differing approaches to school reform but
closer than ever in their criticism of the Reagan administration.
   American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker will
ask his 3,000 delegates at their July 2-6 convention in San
Francisco to endorse his call for a myriad of experimental
``schools within schools.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, the president of the giant National
Education Association, will seek from her 8,000 delegates, meeting
in New Orleans July 4-7, an endorsement of her proposal to create
an experimental lighthouse district in each state where ``anything
goes.''
   Like the rest of the labor movement, both the NEA and the AFT
have refrained from endorsing a candidate for president.
   That could change for the NEA as early as next Saturday when its
board of directors meets in New Orleans. The NEA's political action
committee will consider an endorsement on Friday.
   If it decides to make an endorsement, the 1.9 million-member NEA
would be the first major union to back Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   The AFT, like its parent AFL-CIO, is holding its fire, but its
leaders are not. Both Shanker and Rachelle Horowitz, the AFT's
political director, will be Dukakis delegates in Atlanta.
   Futrell, a Mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist in
her home state of Virginia, will not be a delegate this time
around. But Kenneth Melley, the NEA's director of government
relations, said the union will have a contingent of about 250
delegates in Atlanta, with a large majority for Dukakis and several
dozen for Jesse Jackson.
   The NEA fielded nearly 400 delegates in 1984 at the Democratic
convention.
   Both unions now are unremittingly hostile to the education
policies of President Reagan and his secretary of education,
William J. Bennett, who has accused teacher unions of trying to
``hijack'' the school reform movement with extortionate demands for
more money without increased accountability.
   The AFT, which has criticized Reagan's education cuts, invited
Reagan to address its convention five years ago and heard him
shower the union with praise for being open-minded on things such
as merit pay and for supporting a rigorous curriculum.
   Whatever openness the AFT exhibited then, it has since reverted
to a stance as critical of merit pay as any taken by the NEA.
Indeed, one of the nation's largest experiments with merit pay is
underway in Fairfax County, Va., the 10th biggest school district,
where most of the teachers belong to the NEA.
   A resolution on education reform that will be debated by the AFT
delegates says many of the reforms launched since the 1983 report
``A Nation At Risk'' has been bad. Of merit pay, it says,
``Traditional merit pay schemes, now bearing new names, continue to
rear their unsubstantiated heads.''
   Shanker, unlike Futrell, is still on the White House guest list
for education events. Or at least he was until this spring, when he
emerged from a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of ``A Nation
At Risk'' to write a barbed open letter to Bennett accusing him of
a ``major failure of leadership.''
   ``Instead of leading your troops, you kept shooting at them,''
Shanker said.
   Futrell said in an interview, ``It took him 3{ years to realize
Mr. Bennett was not an advocate for education.''
   Shanker said he does not regret the AFT policy of willingness to
entertain any and all school reform proposals. His affiliates in
Rochester, N.Y., Dade County, Fla., Toledo, Ohio, and Hammond,
Ind., have received wide attention for contracts that give teachers
more say in school management and peer review, but also hold them
accountable for improved performance.
   ``I think we have fairly widespread acceptance now of things
that were considered pretty radical a few years ago,'' including
peer review and wider teacher involvement in decision making,
Shanker said.
   But he remains deeply pessimistic about the current structure of
most public schools, which Shanker contends deliver an inadequate
education to 80 percent of American students. That is why he favors
radical and widespread experimentation with new forms of school
organization.
   The resolution backed by the AFT's Executive Council would put
the union on record as favoring Shanker's idea of allowing groups
of six to 12 teachers the wherewithal to set up their own schools
within school, provided they got the approval of their local union
and school board, and could convince enough teachers, parents and
students to voluntarily sign up for the type of instruction they
were offering.
   Futrell said she hopes her lighthouse school district proposal
will lead to establishment of model districts in all 50 states.
   ``We want them to feel free to experiment. What we want is to
fundamentally and systemically restructure school systems. We're
willing to look at everything,'' she said.
   At the same time, the union would insist that such models not be
created by top-down fiat, but through consensus among all affected
constituencies: parents, teachers, school administrators, business.
   She wants to include rural, urban and suburban districts, and at
least some of those districts should reflect ``the racial and
ethnic makeup of our country.''
   Another issue expected to spur debate at both teacher
conventions is the tracking of students into classes for students
with high, middle and low abilities. Futrell has been sharply
critical of tracking, which some researchers say does little good
for kids at the top and harms the kids at the bottom.
   A proposed NEA resolution says: ``The National Education
Association believes that the use of discriminatory academic
tracking based on socioeconomic status, race, or sex must be
eliminated in all public school settings. The Association urges its
affiliates to oppose these practices.''
   Futrell indicated she will ask her delegates to authorize a
major study over the next year of tracking and ways to devise less
discriminatory alternatives.
   It remains a thorny issue.
   ``I think it's very political,'' Futrell said. ``We have to be
honest. In some school districts, in order to hold on to the middle
class white students, you needed to set up the Advanced Placement
or high level classes.''
   The NEA's membership has grown in the past year to more than 1.9
million _ including about 1.5 million public school teachers _
while the AFT has 665,000 members, including about 450,000
teachers. There are more than 2.3 million teachers in public
schools; roughly 15 percent belong to neither union.
   Futrell is entering her sixth and final year as NEA president.
Shanker is running unopposed for re-election as head of AFT, a post
he has held since 1974.

<HEAD>Communist Party Conference First Since 1941</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Soviet Conference,b0639-b0640</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party Conference opening Tuesday
will be the 19th such gathering in Soviet history and the first
since 1941.
   Here are highlights from some past party conferences, which
under present rules can be called at any time to consider ``urgent
questions of party policy.''
   _First Communist Party Conference held by Russian
revolutionaries at an exile base in Tammerfors, Finland, in 1905,
the year of a bloody, unsuccessful uprising that set the stage for
the collapse of the monarchy 12 years later and the Bolshevik
Revolution that brought the Communists to power.
   Seven party conferences were held in Paris, Prague and other
cities outside Russia as revolutionaries plotted the overthrow of
Czar Nicholas II.
   _1912, the Prague conference votes to create an all-Russian
workers' newspaper, which is today the official party organ, Pravda.
   _1924, a party conference held days before the death of Soviet
founder Vladimir Lenin condemned Leon Trotsky and his followers,
signaling the rise of Josef Stalin, who was to lead the Soviet
state for most of the next three decades.
   _1929, the 16th Party Conference approves the first five-year
plan, the keystone of what has become a cumbersome, centrally
managed economy.
   The 16th conference also ordered a purge of party ranks that
presaged Stalin's mass political repression of the late 1930s.
   _1941, the 18th Party Conference orders party organizations to
oversee the management of industry and transport as the nation
rushes to prepare for war with Germany.
   The party's entanglement in practically all governmental and
economic affairs, which grew from the resolutions of the 16th and
18th conferences, is a key target of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's decentralization drive.

<HEAD>Major Issues of Communist Party Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No specific agenda has been announced for the 19th
Communist Party Conference, but delegates may consider a wide range
issues put before them by the policy-making Central Committee or by
speakers recognized by the conference leadership.
   Whether specific recommendations emerge from the debate could
provide an indication of whether Soviet party leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev or more conservative forces among the delegates control
the conference.
   The conference starts Tuesday and is now expected to last at
least four days. Among the matters likely to be raised:
   THE PARTY'S ROLE _ Gorbachev has said he wants to get party
workers out of the hair of state and industry managers. The party,
he said, should focus on political and ideological work, rather
than try to rule every aspect of Soviet life.
   STALINISM _ The conference will play a role in the effort to
come to terms with the legacy of Josef Stalin, who ran the Soviet
Union with an iron hand for nearly 30 years. Part of that legacy
has been a cult of personality, now condemned. He also developed
the ``command'' economcy, with all decisions made in the Kremlin
and passed down to individual factories and farms.
   PARTY CONTROL _ Gorbachev's reform-minded followers may press
for new rules to limit party officials to two five-year terms and
could set a mandatory retirement age, perhaps 75. The move would
shake up the entrenched party bureaucracy that is seen as an
obstacle to reform and enable Gorbachev to bring in new blood to
help press his modernization program known as ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring.
   Expansion of multi-candidate elections, conducted by secret
ballot, to all party offices up to the 300-plus members of the
Central Committee is another proposal.
   OFFICIAL POWERS _ An overhaul of the legal system to protect
individual rights and insulate the system from political pressure
is among the topics up for discussion.
   There also are proposals for some form of separation of powers,
making the Supreme Soviet, now largely a rubber-stamp parliament
that follows the will of the party, an independent, representative
legislature.
   ECONOMY _ Under increasing pressure to show some tangible
results of ``perestroika,'' Gorbachev could ask the conference to
recommend changes in economic policy, particularly in agriculture,
where Soviet officials say permitting families to lease farms from
their collectives could produce a dramatic increase in the nation's
food supply, a constant subject of consumer complaints.

   Stocks surged on news of a strengthened dollar, positive
economic reports and eased pressure on interest rates, boosting the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks to the highest level
since the crash eight months ago.
   The catalyst for Wednesday's rally appeared to be a surprising
surge in the dollar, which rose to nearly 129 Japanese yen. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 43.03 points to 2,152.20.
   Bonds, meanwhile, rose as much as $18 for every $1,000 of face
value, with interest rates on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond
dropping to 8.91 percent from 9.08 percent late Tuesday.

   On other markets Wednesday, precious metals futures plummeted
while Treasury bond and stock-index futures posted sharp gains;
livestock and meat futures fell sharply; and energy futures

   On the Chicago Board of Trade, oat futures soared on reports
that as much as 50 percent of the U.S. oat crop had been lost to
the drought. Corn for July delivery closed up the permissable limit

   Gasoline futures have rallied for a second
straight session, lending strength to oil prices.
   The July contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.41 cent to close
at 50.40 cents a gallon Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The July contract for home heating oil gained 0.34 cent
to close at 43.62 cents a gallon.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, picked up 8 cents to close at $16.44 per barrel.
   The market opened lower because of abundant supplies of crude
oil on world markets, said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the
energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   But gasoline prices, which also had rallied on Tuesday, moved
higher and supported oil prices, he said.
   Gas futures rose on fears that supplies would be tight, Beutel
said. Traders were concerned about the backup of gasoline barges on
the Mississippi River, especially with the summer driving season at
hand.
   The drought in the Midwest has shrunk water levels on rivers and
many barges have either run aground or become snagged in traffic
bottlenecks. The Army Corps of Engineers is running dredging
operations to allow the barges to move, but progress has been slow.

<TEXT>
   Actor Alan Alda has teamed up for the first time
with an ensemble of stars from the ``M-A-S-H'' television series in
some new advertising for International Business Machines Corp.
   An IBM commercial in which Alda and other ex-M-A-S-H performers
pose as workers in the same office has been completed and should be
appearing on national television soon, an IBM spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Print versions of the ad also are being prepared.
   In the spring of 1987, IBM rounded up about a half-dozen actors
who had appeared in the popular television series including Harry
Morgan, Loretta Swit and Gary Burghoff and had them pose as office
workers in commercials for IBM's new family of Personal System-2
computers.
   Alda, who was Hawkeye Pierce in the long-running ``M-A-S-H''
series, was conspicuously absent from that crew, reportedly because
he still was under contract to another computer company, Atari Corp.
   In mid-February, IBM disclosed it had signed Alda to a
multi-year contract to appear in commercials. Initially, he was
used alone in IBM ads.
   In one new commercial, which was shown to industry analysts and
the media on Monday at a briefing where IBM unveiled a new line of
mid-range computers, Alda and Morgan are shown walking into a stark
office to have a chat. A small plant can been seen in the hallway.
   As the commercial progresses, sequential scenes are shown in
which more and more people including Swit, Burghoff and Jamie Farr
show up for sessions which are described as a pow-wow, then a
meeting and finally a conference.
   The plant in the hallway is bigger in each scene. A small
computer shows up in the second scene, and bigger models turn up in
subsequent scenes.
   The message is that the organization is getting bigger, and the
new family of IBM mid-range computers is helping the business grow.
   Tim Ohsann, a spokesman for IBM, said Wednesday the ensemble ad
was shot in California at the end of May. He said IBM is trying to
schedule the new ads with the television networks and didn't know
precisely when they would air.

<HEAD>Pepsico Agrees to Buy Grand Met Bottling Operations for $705
Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsico Inc. has agreed to pay $705 million in
cash for the soft drink bottling operations of Grand Metropolitan
Inc., the nation's third-largest independent bottler of Pepsi-Cola
products.
   The deal, disclosed Wednesday, is expected to be completed by
late July and involves territories in the Carolinas, Georgia,
Kentucky, Tennessee and Calfornia.
   Grand Metropolitan acquired the operations in 1980. They account
for about 3.6 percent of Pepsi-Cola's domestic soft drink volume.
   But the Montvale, N.J.-based concern said the bottling
operations did not fit its strategic business plan for developing
its core businesses, which include hotels, retailing, foods and
alcoholic beverages.
   ``Although Pepsi is a leader in the soft drinks industry, we do
not own the brand and therefore cannot direct its position in the
marketplace as we do our other brands like Smirnoff,
Inter-Continental and Alpo,'' said Ian A. Martin, chairman of Grand
Metropolitan.
   The operations being sold are Atlantic Soft Drink Co., based in
Columbia, S.C., that holds Pepsi Cola franchises in the Carolinas,
Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee, and Pepsi Cola San Joaquin, which
has franchises in central California.
   Grand Met said the companies had combined annual sales of $355
million in the year ended Sept. 30, 1987.
   D. Wayne Calloway, Pepsico chairman and chief executive, said
the Grand Met franchises will ``significantly strengthen our soft
drink volumes and improve operating profits, both this year and
well into the future.''
   He said the acquisition will dilute Pepsico's earnings for 1988
by about 4 cents a share. In 1987, Pepsico reported net income of
$595 million, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of $11.5 billion.
   The sale would mean Pepsico, which is based in Purchase, N.Y.,
will own bottling operations that account for about 36 percent of
its domestic soft drink volume, up from about 32.4 percent.
   James M. Griffith, a spokesman for Pepsico, said Pepsico was not
looking to acquire independent bottling operations but became
interested once the bottlers became available because they are
located in ``two very important areas where we are determined to
strengthen Pepsi's presence'' and in some cases border territories
Pepsico already owns.
   He said such acquisitions offer ``some economies of scale.''
   A spokeswoman for Grand Met, Mary Carroll, said her company was
approached about three months ago by someone who suggested he may
be prepared to offer a certain price for the bottling operations.
She refused to identify the suitor.
   She said the inquiry prompted the company to consider whether it
wanted to sell the operations, and it subsequently notifified a
limited number of potential bidders that the operations were for
sale.
   Martin said Pepsico offered ``a very fair price.''
   Grand Metropolitan is the U.S. subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, a multinational company based in the United Kingdom. Sales in
the United States exceed $10 billion, the company said.
   Pepsico has operations in soft drinks, snack foods and
restaurants.

<HEAD>Brazil Gets $5.8 Billion Debt Refinancing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debt restructuring Brazil reached
with its creditor banks after eight months of tense negotiations
includes $5.2 billion in new loans, lower interest rates and
payments aimed at bringing the nation current on its obligations.
   Brazil on Wednesday said it had closed a $5.8 billion accord
with its creditor banks to refinance some $64 billion of the
country's massive foreign debt.
   The agreement ends Brazil's negotiations with the committee of
14 banks representing the nation's 700 creditor banks, which now
must sign the accord.
   ``Brazil has concluded one of the best refinancing accords ever
reached by a debtor nation,'' Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega
told reporters at a news conference.
   ``The accord is not a solution to the country's foreign debt
problems but it will bring Brazil closer to the international
financial community and remove the obstacles to economic and social
development of the country,'' he said.
   The accord came a year and a half after Brazil stopped interest
payments on the $64 billion in bank debt in order to conserve
shrinking foreign reserves. The nation's total foreign debt of $121
billion is the largest in the developing world.
   While interest payments were a crippling $1 billion monthly,
inflation soared to 1,000 percent annual levels, money reserves and
the trade surplus dropped dramatically and unemployment skyrocketed
to about 25 percent.
   Under the agreement, Brazil will make a $345 million payment to
creditors for March interest on Friday and by the end of next month
will meet a $1 billion to cover April and May interest, bringing it
current on its obligations.
   But da Nobrega said the agreement did not ``formally revoke''
the moratorium. Da Nobrega said that might happen in October, when
all creditors are expected to have signed the accord and Brazil
receives more than $4 billion.
   Under the agreement, which covers interest due in 1987, 1988 and
the first half of 1989, Brazil will receive $5.2 billion in new
money to meet interest payemtns and debt falling due over the
period will be spread out over 20 years, with an eight-year grace
period.
   Brazil also will receive $600 million in short-term credit lines
toward financing exports and imports.
   In addition, the banks agreed to sharply reduce the interest
rate they had been charging on the $64 billion in loans. Brazil's
spread, or the extra interest charged high-risk clients above the
London Interbank Offered Rate, was to be cut to 0.8125 percent from
the 1.75 percent set under previous agreements. Among developing
nations, only Mexico has obtained such a low spread from creditors.
   One of the sticking points between Brazil and its creditors was
linkage between new money and approval of the country's economic
policies from the International Monetary Fund. Brazil has argued
the fund's policies are recessionary and impinge upon the country's
sovereignty.
   According to the accord, only the $600 million in credit lines
will be linked to meeting economic goals in an IMF-approved plan
and even that decision could be appealed at a later date.
   ``Brazil is the first country to sign a medium-term accord
without having to have any rigid links with the fund,'' da Nobrega
said.
   According to da Nobrega, a Brazil also is allowed to pull out of
the agreement if there are any ``external economic shocks that
impair Brazil's ability to meet interest payments.'' This could
apply to even a drop in Brazil's trade surplus, this year expected
to reach over $13 billion.

   ``We had to diversify ourselves,'' said Gene Rice, chairman and
chief executive officer of MeraBank. ``Any time a bank has all its
eggs in one basket, it can get in trouble. Our long-term objective
is to have 20 percent of our bank in Arizona, 20 percent in Texas
and the balance in other places.''
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board officials guaranteed $83.9 million
in assistance for MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan to absorb First
Financial _ A Savings Association in El Paso, and Brownfield
Savings and Loan Association in Brownfield.
   The transaction announced Wednesday was part of the Southwest
Plan, a federally-funded plan to recapitalize and consolidate
ailing thrifts.
   MeraBank officials still do not know how much in outstanding
loans they will have to write off, said Arthur Gonzalez, president
of MeraBank's Texas division.
   He said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts' loan
portfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inherited
from the ailing thrifts.
   ``This acquisition...was a little unusual in what we agreed to
do with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board without lots of
information,'' Gonzalez said.
   MeraBank Federal Savings and Loan of Phoenix, the largest thrift
in Arizona and 25th largest in the country, has $6.4 billion in
assets.
   MeraBank, which already has seven branches in Texas, is
contributing $8.8 million in new capital to the deal to acquire
First Financial, with $330 million in assets, and Brownfield, with
$40 million.
   MeraBank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent Texas
thrift later this year as part of the transaction. It is forming a
separate subsidiary, MeraBank Texas, to hold the three Texas
institutions.
   Bank board officials said they expect MeraBank Texas to
consolidate all its operations in Texas within six to nine months.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures S&L
deposits up to $100,000, will hold warrants for 20 percent of the
subsidiary's stock, officials said.
   First Financial and Brownfield are the ninth and 10th savings
and loan cases resolved by federal regulators in Texas this year,
while 40 nationwide have been resolved.
   The state's institutions, hard hit by slumps in the oil industry
and real estate valuations, accounted for $3 billion of the
industry's $3.8 billion loss in the first three months of this year.
   Regulators say 133 of Texas' 279 thrifts are insolvent under
generally accepted accounting rules. The bank board hopes to reduce
the number of savings and loans in Texas by about 150 this year.
   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said MeraBank's expansion in
Texas ``will benefit Texas, the thrift industry and FSLIC.''
   The third thrift to be acquired by MeraBank, which is based in
Phoenix, Ariz., would create a deal worth about $1 billion, Rice
said.
   Thrift industry officials said a $1.2 billion loss at Sunbelt
Savings Association of Dallas boosted losses by Texas' savings and
loans to $3.5 billion during the first three months of 1988.
   Operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five states
served by the Dallas office of the bank board widened during the
first quarter of 1988 to $1.1 billion from $623 million in 1987.
   Non-operating losses, primarily funds set aside to cover
non-performing assets, increased to $2.8 billion from $609 million.

   A New York company is helping
Jacksonville solve its part of the national problem of what to do
with the millions of discarded tires littering the landscape.
   The company plans to shred 3 million of Jacksonville's 4 million
junked tires and send them to a company in Greece for industrial
fuel.
   The tires are stored at the Frasier Tire Co. yard, which has
been identified as a breeding ground for the Asian tiger mosquito,
a suspected carrier of deadly dengue fever and encephalitis.
   Jacksonville is paying Oxford Tire Co. of Buffalo, N.Y.,
$538,000 to shred the tires into the size of charcoal briquets.
Oxford said it is selling the shreds to Titan Cement Co. of Athens,
Greece, which will use them to fuel a cement plant.
   ``They actually have produced more (heat energy) than the same
amount of coal,'' Don Bayly, assistant director of the Jacksonville
Bio-Environment Services Division, said of companies using the fuel.
   Bayly said the tires can't be burned here because local
incinerators and boilers aren't designed to handle them without
discharging particulates that would add to air pollution.
   Jim LaDue, vice president of Oxford Tire, said the company could
shred about 1,000 tires an hour with one machine. It hopes to have
about half the tires in the 17-acre dump shredded by the first week
in September and be finished by mid-October. The city contract
gives the company nine months to do the job.
   The city and dump owner Murvin L. Frasier Jr. have been in court
since the city sued him in early 1986 over the tire dump. Earlier
this month, Frasier gave Oxford the right to shred and remove the
tires.
   Some of the tires in Jacksonville were imported from Asia by
recapping companies, which junked them when they proved unusable.
It was in such tires that the Asian mosquito found its way to the
United States, health officials say.
   In addition to the mosquito danger, the mountains of dumped
tires are a major fire hazard that virtually are impossible to
extinguish once ignited, Bayly said.
   Other ideas are in the works to handle the estimated 2 billion
discarded tires littering landscapes throughout the United States,
an amount the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says is
increasing by 250 million annually.
   Bayly said a number of companies are working on incinerators
that will burn tires without pollution, while producing carbon
black and oil as end products.
   According to Oxford's LaDue, Denver has the largest single tire
dump in the United States, with an estimated 8 million tires.
Oxford also will be bidding to rid Denver of its rubber mountain,
he said.
   Oxford began operations in Buffalo last year as a subsidiary of
Integrated Waste Systems. Sales manager Tom Flynn said the company
has a state permit to shred 10,000 tires a day at its Buffalo plant
and is using a shredder at Marion, N.Y., to reduce a pile of
200,000 to 300,000 tires.
   He said the chips can be an environmentally sound fuel
alternative, given the proper type of power plant.
   ``We're looking to burn it with coal on a basis that would
eliminate any smoke or fumes from going into the air,'' Flynn said.
Companies that use it for fuel, he said, would have the proper
scrubbing systems and stacks.

<HEAD>Alaska Governor Calls for Increased Federal Taxes on Gasoline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, the new chairman
of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, says Congress should
substantially increase automotive fuel taxes to curb the flow at
the nation's gas pumps and reduce imports of foreign oil.
   ``This is widely regarded as a politically unpopular proposal,''
Cowper said in a speech prepared for the 29-state commission,
meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo. ``Nevertheless, it is probably
the most effective way to reduce dependence on oil at the gas
pumps.''
   Cowper was sworn in Wednesday as the 1988-89 commission
chairman, replacing North Dakota Gov. George Sinner. The commission
was established by Congress 52 years ago to promote development of
oil and gas reserves.
   In his speech, Cowper warned that the United States must reduce
its dependence on foreign oil.
   In 1983 the nation imported two million barrels of foreign oil a
day. By May 1987 that figure had doubled to four million barrels.
``Last month we were averaging 5.5 million barrels of imports a
day,'' Cowper said.
   ``If that supply is cut off, we will be faced with an
economy-crippling price spike in oil,'' he said.
   Cowper blamed low prices for some of the problem. ``The current
abundance of relatively cheap oil encourages this trend.''
   Cowper also blamed the lack of energy conservation efforts for
the increasing demand.
   Revenue from increased federal taxes on gasoline could be used
to attack both problems, he said.
   ``The proceeds would be used to promote research in alternative
fuels _ ranging from natural gas to grain alcohol fuels _ and to
promote research into other conservation programs,'' Cowper said.
   He did not propose a specific tax hike other than to call for a
``substantial increase.'' An increase of 1 cent per gallon would
yield $1 billion a year for the federal treasury and a 25-cent tax
increase would generate $25 billion, he said.
   Cowper was less enthusiastic about an import tariff on foreign
oil as a means of boosting the price of domestic supplies and
reducing imports.
   Tariff-induced prices would be artificial, he said, and could
hurt the economy more than they would help reduce dependence on
foreign oil.

<HEAD>Judge: Government Can't Force Pension Plans Back on LTV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
is entitled to make employers take back terminated pension plans,
it hasn't proven it's case yet against LTV Corp., a judge has ruled.
   The judge on Wednesday refused to uphold the PBGC's decision to
force the financially ailing LTV to reassume $2 billion in pension
obligations because a new labor contract restored previously cut
benefits.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of Manhattan said the agency,
which insures the pensions of 30 million American workers, had not
explored ``all the relevant facts'' before handing three
underfunded pension plans back to LTV's Cleveland-based steel unit,
LTV Steel Co.
   ``Since the agency's decision is not sustainable on the
administrative record, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the
restoration decision'' that gave back responsibility for the
pensions to LTV, said Sweet.
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Lewis B. Kaden, an attorney for LTV
Corp., who called the ruling ``a complete victory.''
   But Sweet concluded in his 126-page opinion that the PBGC might
be able to make its case with additional data. The judge sent the
issue back to the PBGC ``for further consideration'' and told both
sides to arrange a conference with him on further proceedings.
   ``While the court recognized PBGC's authority to restore
terminated plans, it did not immediately enforce restoration of the
LTV plans,'' said PBGC spokeswoman Jane Hoden. ``Instead, the court
required additional fact finding by the PBGC on LTV's ability to
fund the plans. The PBGC is pleased that the court recognized our
authority to restore plans, but we are disappointed that the court
required additional proceedings.''
   Reading from a statement, she said the PBGC ``is now considering
other legal steps to resolve the issues of this case and relieve
the uncertainty faced by retirees.''
   The Dallas-based LTV, a giant steel, aerospace and energy
concern, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in July 1986.
   The PBGC, which insures pension benefits much like the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. insures bank deposits, took over LTV's
steel industry pension plans last January after the company
terminated them. The plans were $2 billion in debt, making the PBGC
LTV's largest creditor.
   But when a new LTV labor contract with the United Steelworkers
of America restored some benefits previously cut, the agency
claimed that the company was taking unfair advantage of federal
funds to cut costs and gain labor peace.
   LTV, the nation's No. 2 steelmaker, claims that restoring the
plans and their deficit will seriously hamper its ability to
reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings.
   LTV Corp.'s first quarter net income rose 26 percent, according
to the company, because of higher steel prices and the continuing
benefits of federal bankruptcy law protection.
   Last September the PBGC shifted responsibility for the
underfunded pension plans back to LTV, claiming the corporation was
abusing the pension insurance program and its actions could
jeopardize the agency's already strapped nationwide pension
insurance fund.
   But LTV claimed the move violated the automatic stay provision
of the Bankruptcy Code, which bars legal action against companies
in reorganization.
   Sweet ruled, however, that the restoration of pension plans was
allowed under the law that created the PBGC and the action was not
subject to the automatic stay provision.

   Norway will restrain by 7.5 percent its
North Sea oil production during the second half of 1988, the Oil
and Energy Ministry announced Thursday.
   Ministry spokesman Egil Helle said the restrained level will
mean a daily production of 90,000 barrels below full capacity. But
new wells and fields will be opened during the next six months,
raising Norway's overall production, Helle said.
   The cut will apply to all offshore fields.
   The energy ministry said that Norway's average daily production
during the first half of 1988 was about 1.035 billion barrels.
During the second half it is projected to reach 1.125 billion
barrels.
   Norway is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, but it has held back on production since
February 1986 in line with OPEC's efforts to stabilize prices.
   ``The government's decision to reduce the production growth is a
contribution to stabilization of oil prices,'' the ministry said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's economy, fueled by an export-driven manufacturing
boom, expanded at a robust 3.6 percent in the first quarter,
slightly less than previously thought, the government said today.
   Meanwhile, the government revised upwards its estimate of
economic growth in 1988, predicting an expansion of 3.5 percent.
The original predictions was that the economy would grow by 2.9
percent this year.
   Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the presidential Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``The economy is doing better than even we
expected. Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough.''
   He said that contrary to some fears, the economy is not
overheating, with inflation holding at 4.3 percent.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted
annual level of $3.915 trillion in the January-March period, a
$34.6 billion increase from three months earlier.
   It was a modest downward revision of a previous estimate of GNP
growth in the first quarter. Last month, the government put GNP
growth at 3.9 percent, up from an initial estimate of 2.3 percent
in April.
   Analysts were expecting the slight retreat.
   Government economists said the first quarter growth occurred
with little pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, slightly lower than the
previously estimated 1.7 percent and well below the 2.7 percent
pace of the fourth quarter.
   In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said
after-tax corporate profits fell 1.0 percent in the first quarter
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $144.2 billion.
   That was down $1.4 billion from the last three months of 1987
and the worst performance since the first quarter of 1987, when
profits fell 3.7 percent.
   Today's report represents a downward revision from an estimate
last month, when the department said profits after taxes eased up
0.5 percent.
   On Wednesday, a strong rally by the dollar and indications that
inflation may not be heating up as badly as earlier feared helped
spark a stock market rally that pushed Wall Street to its highest
levels since the October crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 43.03 points
to 2,152.20, eclipsing the previous post-crash high of 2,131.40 set
a week earlier.
   Aiding the market was the Commerce Department's report of a 2.2
percent decline in May of orders to U.S. factories for ``big
ticket'' durable goods, the biggest drop in nine months.
   Economists said the decline in orders was healthy because it
indicated the economy was not being overheated by too much pressure
on production capacity.
   Stocks also were helped by a big rise by the dollar in foreign
exchange, a rally that caught many traders by surprise.
   The dollar reached almost 129 Japanese yen in New York, up more
than 2 yen from Tuesday's close.
   Analysts said the dollar's jump may have stemmed partly from the
outcome of the economic summit meeting of the seven major
industrialized countries in Toronto, and a summit communique
hinting there was room for the dollar to strengthen further.
   ``That statement gave the market a signal to buy dollars,'' said
Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   The decline in durable goods orders surprised economists, who
had expected more than a 2 percent rise in orders. But they noted
the government's survey apparently did not include several
multibillion-dollar orders placed to Seattle-based Boeing Co.
   Even though the overall May decline was the largest since
August's 2.3 percent fall, analysts saw little cause to worry that
the report was forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing,
which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters export sales
of U.S. goods.
   Excluding defense goods, orders fell only 0.9 percent. Excluding
airplanes, they rose 0.6 percent.
   The financial markets read the report as good news for
inflation. Many traders and some analysts have been concerned that
the export boom, coupled with steady consumer demand in the United
States, would strain manufacturers' capacity and cause shortages
and price increases.

   The U.S. economy, fueled by an export-driven
manufacturing boom, expanded at a robust 3.6 percent pace in the
first three months of this year, slightly less than previously
thought, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted
annual level of $3.915 trillion in the January-March period, a
$34.6 billion increase from three months earlier.
   Strong first quarter growth has prompted the Reagan
administration to boost its 1988 projection for GNP growth to 3.5
percent. At the start of the year, the administration had predicted
the economy would grow 2.9 percent in 1988, the same rate of growth
as in 1986 and 1987.
   At the time, many private economists were more pessimistic, but
they have since scrambled to increase their predictions.
   ``Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough,'' said Beryl Sprinkel,
chairman of the presidential Council of Economic Advisers. ``The
economy is doing better than even we expected.''
   The latest first quarter numbers were a modest downward revision
of a previous estimate of GNP growth in the first quarter. A month
ago, the government put GNP growth at 3.9 percent. However, in
April, the initial estimate was a much lower 2.3 percent.
   Many analysts were expecting the slight retreat.
   Today's revisions show that non-military spending by the federal
government was $3.8 billion less than previously thought. Most of
that was accounted for by a dip in purchases of surplus farm
commodities.
   Consumer spending, although up a moderately strong 3.8 percent,
was weaker than the previously estimated 4.3 percent growth. Much
of that was due to somewhat less automobile buying than first
thought.
   Immediately after the October stock market crash, many
economists feared the shock to consumer confidence would topple the
country into a recession.
   Consumer spending did post a rare 2.5 percent decline in the
fourth quarter, but it has come back in the first three months of
this year.
   The engines driving the six-year-old economic expansion now,
even more than consumer spending, are rising export sales spurred
by the cheaper dollar and the consequent surge in modernization and
expansion spending by businesses.
   Exports of goods and services were up a strong 22.8 percent in
the first quarter. Business investment in capital equipment shot up
33.1 percent, the fastest rise since the first year of the recovery
from the 1981-82 recession.
   The growth has buried fears of another recession, but now
financial markets have become concerned that the economy is
expanding so rapidly that it will rekindle inflation.
   First quarter growth was occurring with little pickup in
inflation, however. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual
rate of 1.4 percent, slightly lower than the previously estimated
1.7 percent and well below the 2.7 percent pace of the fourth
quarter.
   But, some analysts say inflationary pressures have begun to
surface in the quarter ending this month.
   In a second report, the Commerce Department said U.S.
corporations' after-tax profits fell 1.0 percent in the first
quarter, the poorest showing since profits dipped 3.7 percent in
the first quarter of 1987.
   Last month, the government, in a preliminary estimate, said
profits eased up a slight 0.5 percent in the January-March period.
Profits were up a moderate 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
   Economists say lagging profits could put pressure on businesses
to raise prices.
   The GNP in the fourth quarter of 1987 was even stronger, growing
at a 4.8 percent annual rate. However, much of that production went
into a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and
back lots.
   The mix of growth in the January-March period is considered
better, but the worry now is that too much demand _ from American
consumers as well as from overseas buyers _ will strain factory
capacity, causing shortages and driving up prices.
   With the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close, the signals
are mixed.
   Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is running
at a 4.4 percent annual rate through May, the same as last year.
But drought-spared food price increases have yet to show up at the
retail level.
   And factory operating rates have risen from 82.4 percent of
capacity in March to 82.9 percent in May, creeping closer to the 85
percent level that economists consider clearly inflationary.
   On the plus side, consumer demand seems to be cooling enough to
allow more room for production of exports and business equipment.
Retail sales grew only a lackluster 0.1 percent in May after a 0.4
percent decline in April.
   Most economists are projecting slightly weaker, but not weak,
economic growth in the second quarter.
   ``I would see some modest slowing in the second quarter as
businesses trim down their inventories, but there's too much pep in
the economy for there to be a major slowdown until later in the
year,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National
Association of Manufacturers.

   GAF Corp. confirmed Thursday that it is under
investigation for possible securities law violations, but a
spokesman for the company denied any wrongdoing.
   According to the spokesman, the focus of the investigation
appears to relate to the disposition of a portion of GAF's stock
position in Union Carbide Corp. during late 1986.
   GAF made a hostile bid for Carbide in 1985 but reached a
standstill agreement with the company the following year.
   According to unidentified sources quoted in Thursday's editions
of the Wall Street Journal, the federal government is looking into
GAF's accumulation of Carbide stock through Jefferies & Co., a Los
Angeles securities firm once headed by Boyd L. Jefferies.
   Jefferies pleaded guilty to two felonies after being implicated
in a stock parking scheme by convicted arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky,
who is now serving time in prison.
   James Sherwin, GAF's vice chairman and chief administrative
officer, has been named as having had an agreement with Boyd
Jefferies regarding alleged stock parking and manipulation, the
newspaper said.
   Under their alleged agreement, GAF agreed to reimburse the
Jefferies firm for losses incurred in trading in Carbide stock.
   The Journal's sources noted that Sherwin did not make any money
from the scheme. The U.S. attorney's office in New York appears
undecided as to whether it will seek criminal charges in the case,
the paper said.
   ``Both the company and its officials are innocent of any
wrongdoing,'' a spokesman for GAF said.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GAF had fallen
$1.62{ a share to $46{.
   According to the Journal, GAF is the first industrial company to
be targeted for investigation in the government's widespread probe
of abuses within the securities industry.
   The paper noted that the investigation could hamper GAF Chairman
Samuel Heyman's planned $1.27 billion leveraged buyout of the
Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals and building materials company.
   But the GAF spokesman said, ``the outcome of this matter will
not have any material financial consequences to the company, and
plans for management's proposed leveraged buyout of GAF remain
unaffected.''

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that
crop damage from the scorching drought was bound to deepen.
   Soybeans for July delivery blasted to a 15-year high in early
trading after topping $10.76{ a bushel, the 1977 top price for a
near-month contract.
   Scattered rain fell in parts of the eastern Farm Belt Wednesday
but analysts said only a return to normal rainfall patterns could
ward off further wreckage in the country's corn, oat, spring wheat
and soybean fields.
   Experts estimate the drought has already devastated at least 50
percent of the oat and spring wheat crops, 30 percent of corn and
will begin to take a significant toll on soybeans in July.
   Corn for July delivery opened up the 10-cents-a bushel limit;
July soybeans quickly traded up their 45-cent limit, putting the
contract within { cent of $11 a bushel; and oat futures opened
limit-up.
   Weekend weather forecasts for more light, scattered showers in
the Midwest may have a slight slowing effect on the rally, said
Cathy Leow, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   ``I would say the market is going to remain strong, although
some profit-taking may come in today and tomorrow,'' she said.
   In early trading, wheat was 7 cents to 11 cents higher with July
at $3.92{ a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 10 cents higher with July
at $3.54{ a bushel; oats were 14} cents to 15 cents higher with
July at a record $3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 21 cents to 45 cents
higher with July at $10.99{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower to limit-down in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .42 cent to 1.20 cents lower with August at
62.12 a pound; feeder cattle were 1.15 cents to the limit 1.50
cents lower with August at 69.15 cents a pound; hogs were the limit
1.50 cents lower to .05 cent higher with July at 44.40 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to the limit 2 cents lower
with July at 40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed sharply lower Wednesday.

<HEAD>Battle Over Societe Generale To End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
has agreed to sharply reduce his stake in Societe Generale de
Belgique, ending a lengthy takeover battle for Belgium's largest
holding company, sources said Thursday.
   Under terms of a settlement, De Benedetti will sell part of his
45 percent stake in Societe Generale to Cie. Financiere de Suez, a
French banking company that, along with its allies, holds a slim
majority.
   The sale will reduce De Benedetti's holdings to about 15
percent, thereby blocking his ability to manipulate decisions that
require a 75 percent vote of shareholders.
   In return, however, De Benedetti would get a cash payment, at
least three seats on Societe Generale's board and would increase
his stake in Suez, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The agreement is expected to be formally announced Friday at a
news conference called by Societe Generale, whose holdings in
industries including energy, finance, chemicals, mining and
transport control about a third of Belgium's economy.
   De Benedetti announced in January he sought to control Societe
Generale. The Belgian company resisted his overtures but had to
look for foreign support in Suez, which along with the Belgian
insurer Groupe AG came to control slightly more than 50 percent of
the holdign company's shares.
   At a special meeting two months ago, shareholders spurned De
Benedetti's bid to win board seats for himself and two allies.
   Suez's strengthened stake under the settlement should allow the
French group to run Societe Generale with its own new chief
executive, reorganizing the company's often criticized strategy as
well as its management structure.
   A statement issued earlier this week confirming negotiations
were underway said Suez and its allies will back the nomination of
Herve de Carmoy, a French banker, to Societe Generale's board,
while De Benedetti and his allies will abstain.
   It is expected that De Carmoy will be asked to take over a large
part of Societe Generale's management.
   The French-Belgian group was also reported to be interested in
looking for more foreign partners, including the British media
magnate Robert Maxwell.
   Under the agreement between De Benedetti and Suez, Belgians'
stake in Societe Generale will decline substantially, according to
Belgian press reports.
   The conservative daily La Libre Belgique wrote: ``The decision
center has moved to Paris. Belgians will have to fight hard to
defend the national character of the company.''

   The Federal Communications Commission today
voted to levy the first fine for violation of its new decency
standards on a Missouri television station that aired a sexy movie
during prime time.
   Commissioners voted 2-1 to impose the maximum $2,000 fine
against KZKC-TV for its May 1987 broadcast of ``Private Lessons,''
which included scenes of a bare-breasted woman seducing a teen-ager.
   The Kansas City station aired the movie at 8 p.m., a time the
FCC has determined children are likely to be in the audience. The
FCC's guidelines allow ``indecent'' material to be aired after
midnight to lessen the risk that such programs could be viewed by
children.
   Attorney Thomas Davidson, who represents the station, said he
was ``shocked and surprised and outraged by the imposition of the
maximum fine in light of the circumstances.'' He said the sanction
is unfair because ``we don't know what is indecent because the
statute doesn't provide any guidance.''
   All three commissioners said that the movie fit the FCC's
definition of indecency, but Commissioner Patricia Dennis disagreed
with the fine. She said ``parents, not the commission, should bear
the primary responsibility of deciding what their children should
watch at night.''
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick disagreed, saying the government
must help parents in deciding what their children watch on
television. He said it is reasonable to assume that there are
unsupervised children in the audience during prime-time hours.
   Patrick said Wednesday that the FCC's record on indecency has
been clear.
   ``While respecting the First Amendment rights of all citizens,
we have taken clear and decisive action to enforce the statutory
ban on broadcast obscenity and to further restrict the broadcast of
indecent material so as to put parents in a better position to
control their children's access to this type of material,'' he said.
   Media Central Inc., which owns KZKC, has said the film had been
cut by an inexperienced editor and violated company standards, but
a fine would be inappropriate because the FCC's indecency
guidelines are ambiguous and are being applied to TV for the first
time.
   The movie, the owners said, was aired little more than a month
after the new standards were adopted. The FCC guidelines are being
challenged in court by broadcasting groups, news organizations and
public interest advocates as being unconstitutionally vague and
overbroad.
   Media Central acknowledged that the airing of the 1980 sex
comedy violated KZKC's ``broadcast standards and sense of good
taste,'' but the company said station officials took immediate
corrective action after the broadcast, including a clarification of
the station's policy on frontal nudity.
   Attorney Thomas Davidson, representing Media Central, said it
would be premature to comment before the commission acted.
   Media Central, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., is awaiting court
action on a reorganization plan it filed under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Act.
   ``Private Lessons'' is about a wealthy 15-year-old boy who is
seduced by his housekeeper. The film includes several scenes in
which the housekeeper is shown bare-breasted.
   The FCC decided in April 1987 to apply the wording of a 1978
Supreme Court decision that said indecent material is ``language or
material that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   The commission said indecent material may be aired only when
there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience.
In a subsequent ruling in November 1987, the FCC said it would
consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after
midnight. Previously the FCC had considered 10 p.m. the cutoff time.

   The government today predicted that the
economy will grow at a larger-than-expected 3.5 percent rate in
1988 and that inflation will hold steady at 4.3 percent, with the
odds overwhelming against a recession.
   A slight increase in interest rates, about a half percent, was
forecast for the year.
   In revising earlier estimates, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, said, ``Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy
enough.
   ``The economy is doing better than even we expected.''
   The administration originally had predicted the economy would
grow by 2.9 percent this year.
   President Reagan, responding to a reporter's question at a
picture-taking session with visiting Australian Prime Minister
Robert Hawke, said he was not worried about a new round of
inflation ``and I don't think we should.''
   ``All the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and,
no, there is no great threat of inflation,'' the president said.
   Sprinkel said the drought could have ``a significant effect on
food prices'' unless there is rain soon. However, he said the farm
community generates only about two percent of the Gross National
Product, the broadest gauge of economic health.
   Asked about the administration's new projections, private
economist Michael K. Evans agreed with the upward revision in the
economic growth prediction but disagreed with the inflation
estimate.
   ``He's certainly right about better growth, ... but the rest is
just pie in the sky stuff,'' said Evans, a private economic
consultant in Washington.
   ``We're not going to have double-digit inflation, but a
reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5
to 5.5 percent,'' he said. ``Nobody can be faulted for not
forecasting the drought ahead of time, but now that it has occurred
you have to make some upward revisions because of it.''
   Sprinkel released his new estimates at a White House briefing.
Asked if the figures mean there is no chance of a recession,
Sprinkel said, ``I wouldn't say it's zero danger. Anything can
happen.
   ``But it's our view the overwhelming odds suggest that the
economy will continue to expand on average this year even though at
a more moderate pace than was evident in the first quarter,''
Sprinkel said.
   He said that, contrary to some fears, the economy is not
overheating. Moreover, he said, ``there is no sign of an upsurge in
inflation.''
   Sprinkel said the economic growth rate would slow somewhat over
the last nine months of the year from its first-quarter pace.
   He said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being
revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988
and the stronger-than-expected growth experienced during 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For 1989, the administration expects the economy to grow 3.1
percent.
   Economic growth is measured two ways, on an annual basis and on
a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.
   The 3.5 percent 1988 growth forecast is for year-to-year change.
   Using the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter comparison, the
administration predicted the economy will grow at a 3 percent rate,
compared iwith the earlier estimate of 2.4 percent.
   In revising the figures, Sprinkel noted that the economy had
expanded faster than expected in the first three months of the
year, 3.6 percent.
   ``We do expect slower growth over the remainder of the year,''
he said.
   The inflation estimate, as measured by the consumer price index,
is still 4.3 percent, the same as originally predicted on a fourth
quarter-to-fourth quarter basis, Sprinkel said.
   The estimate for interest rates was revisd upward about a half
percent.
   As measured by rates for 91-day Treasury bills, inflation was
estimated at 6 percent, compared with a 5.3 percent rate forecast
earlier. Measured on the basis of rates for 10-year Treasury
securities, the rate was forecast at 8.5 percent, compared with 8
percent predicted earlier.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``For those of you who are always trying to figure out what we
are thinking, it means we envision some decline in interest rates
later this year, as the economy's growth rate slows from the rapid
first quarter rate and inflation continues to abate,'' Sprinkel
said.
   The forecast unemployment rate was slightly lower than
originally estimated, 5.5 percent for the year now as compared with
an earlier projection of 5.8 percent.

   A top Navy official whose phone was tapped in
the massive Pentagon bribery probe has begun cooperating with
prosecutors, while a Justice Department official said today that
others are following suit.
   Deputy Assistant Navy Secretary James Gaines, whose office was
searched last week, has begun telling prosecutors what he knows,
sources familiar with the investigation said.
   One Justice Department official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said today that ``there has been some interest shown on
the part of some individuals in cooperating with the
investigation.'' He said that some information ``has already been
obtained .''
   Other sources familiar with the probe said the interest was
coming from subjects who are working in the Pentagon.
   At the White House, meanwhile, President Reagan told reporters
he has arranged for a report on the present status of the
investigation, but did not say how soon he expects to receive it.
   Responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting
Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke today, Reagan said, ``I am
asking, and have arranged - they are coming over to give me a full
report.'' He said the report would deal with the question of
``where are we now and how much do we know already?''
   The Los Angeles Times reported today that investigators believe
Gaines was a principal supplier of Pentagon documents to defense
consultant Melvyn R. Paisley, who was assistant secretary of the
Navy and Gaines' boss until April 1987.
   The Times, quoting government sources, said Paisley allegedly
arranged an elaborate scheme under which high-level Pentagon
officials smuggled classified documents out of the Pentagon and
allowed him to copy them with the aid of his wife.
   The newspaper said Paisley allegedly passed the sensitive
information to McDonnell Douglas Corp., which had retained him as a
consultant shortly after he left his Pentagon post. One source told
the Times that Paisely received ``staggering fees'' from the
company.
   The 2-year-old investigation focuses on allegations that private
consultants, many of them former Pentagon employees, paid bribes to
obtain Defense Department secrets about upcoming contracts.
   Gaines made an appointment to hire a Washington-area defense
lawyer, but then abruptly canceled the meeting after getting a call
from a federal investigator who told him that ``you have until 9
a.m. tomorrow to decide whose side you're on,'' according to one
source. Gaines decided several days ago to cooperate, said the
sources.
   While Gaines is talking with prosecutors, another Pentagon
official whose office was searched, Victor Cohen, is negotiating
with the government on whether to do the same, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   After a meeting with the chief prosecutor in the probe, one of
the Pentagon's strongest supporters in the Senate said ``people
will really be shocked'' by the scale of wrongdoing involved.
   ``It appears they have very good evidence,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., said after being briefed by Henry Hudson, the
U.S. attorney for eastern Virginia.
   Both Gaines and Cohen had key procurement jobs in the Pentagon.
Gaines was deputy assistant Navy secretary for acquisition
management while Cohen was a top deputy to the deputy assistant Air
Force secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control,
communications and computer systems. Both men have been reassigned
since the investigation became public.
   While Hudson was describing the case to congressional leaders on
Wednesday, former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was defending
his Pentagon management style and warning against public and
congressional overreaction to the disclosures.
   ``No matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able to
eliminate dishonesty,'' Weinberger said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Hudson told congressional leaders in closed meetings that 75 to
100 contracts worth ``tens of billions of dollars'' are under
scrutiny, according to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said after hearing Hudson that ``these
contracts may have to be examined to determine if they were in fact
tainted by these allegations.''
   Hudson told reporters that there may not be any indictments
until after the Nov. 8 election.
   ``I'm hopeful that if indictments are appropriate in the case,
they will be secured by the end of the year,'' the prosecutor said.
``If we can proceed at a faster pace, we'll attempt to do it.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said Hudson also told
lawmakers that no member of Congress is a target of the
investigation so far, despite news leaks identifying several as
under scrutiny.
   ``No subpoena has been sought for any member of Congress, no
wiretap has been directed at any member of Congress and no search
warrant has been directed at any member of Congress,'' Wright said.
   Hudson said the investigation focuses primarily on the sale of
inside information by private consultants who were acting as
middlemen between the Pentagon and defense contractors, Wright said.
   In other developments:
   _The Baltimore Sun reported in Thursday's editions that the
investigation has spread to two dozen Pentagon employees and about
60 companies. Citing sources that it did not identify, the
newspaper said bribes ranging up to $50,000 had been paid to some
government employees for sensitive contract information and
proprietary industry data.
   _Joan Galvin, the 28-year-old daughter of a defense consultant
under investigation and an aide to Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla., was
relieved on Wednesday of handling military issues for Ireland. The
congressman is one of five House members of the House whose names
have come up in the case. Ms. Galvin remains on Ireland's staff as
a legislative assistant dealing with other issues.
   Ms. Galvin was reassigned because she and Ireland agreed she
would be in an ``untenable position'' if she continued to handle
military matters because her father, defense consultant William
Galvin, ``is a principal in the investigation,'' said a spokesman
for Ireland, Doug Hattaway.
   Ireland and the other four congressmen reported under scrutiny
have all said they are not targets of the inquiry. The others are
Reps. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations
defense subcommittee; Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.; Samuel S. Stratton,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Armed Services procurement
subcommittee; and Roy Dyson, D-Md., a member of Stratton's
subcommittee. Ireland is also on the Stratton panel.
   Weinberger, one of President Reagan's closest friends and
staunchest allies, complained that the case was prompting Congress
and the public to lose sight of the continuing need for a strong
defense.
   ``You don't close a bank because there's been a bank robbery,''
Weinberger said. ``The Pentagon awards 52,000 contracts every
single day, and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest
people.''

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were
little changed Thursday amid some profit-taking and uncertainty
over the market's direction.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off 0.4
point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,878.9.
   Trading volume was 558.9 million shares, compared with 521.6
million shares Wednesday.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be consolidating the
advances of the previous two sessions, when the key index climbed
35 points.
   ``People are starting to question whether the rise to 1,900 is
sustainable,'' one trader said.
   Roger Charlesworth, senior dealer at Chase Manhattan Securities
in London, said the market was having a delayed reaction to
Wednesday's news of a half-point rise in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate to 9 percent.
   Higher rates, he said, ``might be quite bearish because it's not
to wring inflationary pressure from the economy but rather to
stabilize the currency.''
   News that Rowntree PLC had decided to accept Nestle S.A.'s
sweetenend takeover offer of 2.55 billion pounds, or about $4.5
billion, continued to support selected issues in an otherwise
declining market, dealers said.

   Crews dredged the drought-shrunken Mississippi River around the
clock today to free hundreds of backed-up barges, while
triple-digit temperatures prompted autoworkers to walk off the job
after a co-worker collapsed and died.
   Sprinklings of rain Wednesday succeeded only in frustrating
farm-belt growers, while thunderstorms across the Northeast earned
a round of applause from baseball fans at Tiger Stadium in Detroit
during a rain delay.
   ``With the searing heat we've had the situation has become very,
very serious as our crops begin to deteriorate,'' said Iowa's
secretary of agriculture, Dale Cochran. ``In the next 10 days, if
we don't get rain we could lose 50 percent of our corn crop.''
   A series of fierce thunderstorms ripped across southern New
Hampshire during the night, knocking down trees and causing power
outages and at least two fires while as much as 2 inches of rain
fell on parts of Vermont.
   Rain also fell in Clyde, Ohio, where Sioux Indian Chief Leonard
Crow Dog had performed a rain ceremony he promised would bring rain
by today. Florist Cliff Doebels, who brought Crow Dog to the
northwestern Ohio town, said he wasn't sure if the chief deserved
the credit for the showers.
   ``I'm not one to know those answers,'' he said. ``All I know is
you flip a coin and sometimes it comes up heads.''
   South Dakota officials today increased the estimated acreage
burned by fires on dried out land, saying a fire near the Montana
border had burned 5,600 acres while the West Short Pines fire to
the south burned about 4,700 acres.
   Idaho firefighters dug in today around a wildfire burning out of
control over 35 acres of heavily wooded mountainous area in the
Boise National Forest. The fire was apparently sparked by lightning
Wednesday afternoon.
   In Fenton, Mo., a Chrysler Corp. autoworker died after
collapsing Wednesday night in what co-workers said was unbearable
heat in a paint shop, as temperatures in the St. Louis area topped
100 degrees. Medical officials today said he died of a heart attack.
   ``It's so hot, you can hardly breathe in there. It's like you're
smothering _ like you're inside an oven,'' said one worker, Bertha
Saxton. ``Your skin is like someone poured baby oil on you.''
   An autopsy today found that Willie Benton, 54, of Kirkwood, had
severe coronary artery disease, said St. Louis County Health
Department Director Kenneth Ballwin. He said doctors in the medical
examiner's office found no evidence that heat was a factor in
Benton's death.
   Shortly after he collapsed, hundreds of paint-shop workers at
Chrysler's No. 1 and 2 plants walked off their jobs because of the
heat. The walkout, the second in two days, forced the assembly
lines at both plants to shut down, but they were back in operation
this morning, said Lloyd Northard, a spokesman for Chrysler in
Detroit.
   Doug Nicoll, a Chrysler spokesman, said the buildings have no
air conditioning but are ventilated and workers are given ice.
   Also Wednesday, the Coast Guard for the first time limited the
number of barges towboats can push in a major portion of the
Mississippi. The limits were sought by barge companies that want to
prevent towboat operators from running their loads aground in
record-low water.
   ``There's got to be a doomsday point out there somewhere. Right
now, I don't know anybody that I've talked to who can give me any
idea where that is,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas Sands, president of
the Mississippi River Commission. ``Right now, we are not on the
brink of disaster.''
   Under the limits, southbound towboats must have no more than 20
barges while northbound boats will be limited to 25, only 16 of
which can be loaded, said Cmdr. Michael Donohoe.
   Authorities said the 24-hour dredging of the river near Memphis,
Tenn., would take until Friday afternoon, and more than 1,200
barges, many recently freed from other backlogs, were expected to
stack up. Crews on the Ohio River also worked to break bottlenecks.
   In Kentucky, phosphorus leaking from a derailed tanker burst
into flames in 99-degree heat late Wedesday, spreading a toxic
cloud across five western Kentucky counties and driving thousands
from their homes.
   White phosphorus spontaneously burns when exposed to air
temperatures above 85 or 90 degrees, said Dr. George Rodgers of the
Poison Control Center in Louisville.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng met in Chicago today
with governors from drought-stricken states to advise a committee
of the National Governors' Association on the crisis and the
outlook for the nation.
   ``We'll need a little bit of time to determine what the losses
are,'' Lyng said. ``But we will do what is needed to minimize the
severity of the damage.''
   He said the federal government's response would include
expansion of existing crop insurance and disaster loan programs.
   The day before, Lyng met in Washington with a congressional
drought task force, which urged him to take all steps in his power
to provide relief.
   Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, said the focus of immediate efforts is
on assuring feed for livestock and that legislative action to deal
with crop losses would be delayed until officials determine the
extent of the damage.
   The record-setting heat wave continued to quicken the
evaporation of moisture from the soil, but temperatures began to
drop and the National Weather Service predicted some temporary
relief today.
   A cold front moved through the Great Lakes region and the upper
Mississippi Valley early today and should southward and toward the
Northeast, dropping temperatures into the 80s and 70s.
   The front was expected to bring scattered showers, but ``it
doesn't look like too much change in the situation or perhaps none
at all,'' said Hugh Crowther of the weather service in Kansas City,
Mo.
   By midafternoon Wednesday, two dozen cities had set
high-temperature records. In Philadelphia, the temperature reached
100 degrees for the first time in more than 10 years.
   Boston officials declared a heat emergency, opening up air
conditioned buildings to the elderly. Officials in some Illinois
towns said they might cancel July 4 fireworks because of tinder-dry
vegetation.
   In Arizona, the Tucson Electric Power Co. reported record usage
Wednesday as an all-time high of 114 degrees was recorded.
   In Charles City, Iowa, radio station KCHA awarded a water hose
and sprinkler to Vicky Vorpahl for providing the best answer to a
contest that asked listeners to complete the sentence, ``It's so
dry that ...''
   Her response: ``It's so dry that cows are giving powdered milk.''

<HEAD>Rowntree Agrees to $4.5 Billion Buyout From Nestle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rowntree PLC on Thursday agreed to a sweetened,
$4.5 billion buyout offer from Swiss foods giant Nestle SA, ending
the months-long ``candy bar war'' for the British confectioner.
   Nestle's 2.55 billion-pound offer edges out rival bidder Jacobs
Suchard AG, a Swiss chocolate and coffee concern, to create the
world's second-largest confectioner behind Mars Inc.
   The bid for Rowntree, maker of the Kit Kat candy bar, is the
largest offer for a British company by a foreign concern.
   Nestle will pay 10.75 pounds a share, or $19.03, up from its
initial bid of 2.1 billion pounds, or 890 pence a share. The
confectioner increased its stake in Rowntree to 22 percent Thursday
from a previous 15.8 percent.
   Suchard, which holds a 29.9 percent stake in Rowntree, had
offered 2.32 billion pounds, or 950 pence a share.
   Tim Potter, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
London, noted that Nestle's bid not only is 13 percent higher than
Suchard's offer, but Nestle ``got the board along with the
agreement, which is crucial in this takeover battle. That is
probably enough to win Rowntree.''
   Suchard declined to comment on its plans, but Walter Anderau,
the company's vice president for corporate affairs, said, ``We are
in no rush.'' But he said Suchard is ``still convinced that
Rowntree would be the ideal partner for us.''
   Analysts predict Suchard, which will drop from second to third
place among worldwide confectioners, is likely to sell out to its
rival. At the current buyout price, Suchard's profit would amount
to about 205 million pounds, Potter said.
   The battle for Rowntree began April 13 when Zurich-based
Suchard, maker of the triangular Toblerone chocolate bar, snapped
up nearly 15 percent of Rowntree's shares in a ``dawn raid.'' That
move prompted Nestle to enter the fray with an initial offer on
April 26. Suchard countered with its bid a month later.
   In trading on the London Stock Exchange, Rowntree closed up 37
pence a share at 10.76 pounds a share.
   Nestle said it assured Rowntree that the confectioner's York
headquarters will remain the center of the company's activities in
Britain and that the office also will serve as headquarters of
Nestle's international chocolate and confectionery ``strategy.''
   In addition, Rowntree Chairman Kenneth Dixon will be retained as
an executive member of the Nestle general management committee.
   The assurances were an apparent attempt to fend off public
criticism about the takeover.
   Rowntree's Dixon said, ``We believe that the price now offered
is fair and shareholders and employees should both gain from the
agreement which has been reached.''
   The competing bids by the two Swiss companies sparked a
controversy in Britain, where critics objected to the acquisition
of the 263-year-old British company by a foreign concern and feared
job losses in York, where Rowntree employs 5,300 of its 30,000
workers.
   The government's decision not to intervene in the takeover bids
sparked protests and divided members of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
   ``This is a sad but inevitable result of the government's
refusal to defend British industry against foreign predators,''
said Bryan Gould, an opposition Labor Party lawmaker.
   Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer's
shop in northeast England, had a pre-tax profit of 112 million
pounds on sales of 1.43 billion pounds in 1987.
   Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, had net profit of 1.8
billion Swiss francs, or about $1.2 billion, on sales of 35.2
billion Swiss francs, or $24 billion last year.
   Helmut Maucher, Nestle's managing director, said, ``We look
forward to building on the strengths of the two companies and
creating a prosperous future for the combined group.''
   The previous largest foreign bid for a British company was
Australia-based Elders IXL's 1986 purchase of the Courage brewing
business from Hanson PLC for 1.4 billion pounds, or $2.5 billion,
according to Mergers and Acquisitions magazine.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday ruled
out the idea of a central bank for the European Economic Community,
saying it could only happen when Europe was united under one
sovereign government.
   Mrs. Thatcher was replying in Parliament to a question from
opposition lawmaker David Owen, a former foreign secretary, who
supported setting up such a bank to ease capital flows and bring
down British interest rates.
   Leaders of the 12-nation EEC are expected to discuss the idea at
a summit in Hanover, West Germany, next week.
   ``You will only have a European central bank when you have a
United States of Europe under one sovereign government and not
under 12, and that they all have the same economic policy,'' said
Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``That being not on the cards, I see no point in having anyone
to study a European central bank,'' she said.

<HEAD>Irving Fails To Act By Bank Of NY Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. failed to respond by a
Thursday deadline set by Bank of New York Co. for accepting a
sweetened $1.4 billion takeover bid.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said the company was
disappointed that no action had been taken, and as a result, the
friendly offer had expired. In a one-page letter sent Thursday to
Bank of New York Chairman J. Carter Bacot, Irving outside director
David L. Luke III said the bank would be ``derelict in its duty if
we tried to respond'' by the noon Thursday deadline set by Bank of
New York on Wednesday.
   Luke said several serious concerns remained, among them, whether
Bank of New York could proceed with its latest offer under the
conditional approval the Federal Reserve Board granted to its
previous $1.2 billion offer. That approval is scheduled to run out
July 9.
   Irving's board of directors, which favors a merger with the
state-run Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, failed to reach a
decision after meeting for several hours on Tuesday. Company
representatives also held a 1{-hour meeting with Bacot.
   Brady said Irving had plenty of time to respond. ``The offer was
out there for 10 days,'' he said.
   Bank of New York had warned that unless Irving's board of
directors went along with its latest proposal it would push for a
quick court decision on related lawsuits and proceed with a hostile
$1.1 billion tender offer. The company is seeking, among other
things, to remove Irving's anti-takeover ``poison pill.''
   Bank of New York improved its offer last week by slightly
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder
incentives, including a special cash dividend.
   It valued the revised bid for all of Irving's 18.5 million
shares outstanding at around $76 a share, or $1.4 billion. That is
about 25 percent higher than the existing hostile $1.1 billion
tender offer.
   Banca Commerciale, Italy's second-largest bank, is offering $80
a share for 51 percent of Irving, or about $760 million. The
proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan that
includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting
measures and a special cash dividend.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Close Mixed In Wild Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
in a wildly erratic session Thursday that saw soybeans hit a
15-year high near $11 a bushel, then plummet 70 cents as the market
developed a feverish case of the jitters.
   ``We're trading hysteria right now,'' said Cathy Leow, an
analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``We're seeing an unprecedented type of weather,'' she said.
``However, it's also a very well-known fact that there is
significant downside risk if the weather situation were to change.''
   The markets opened sharply higher on fears of deepening drought
damage but only oat futures sustained the bullish momentum on
reports estimating oat yield losses of at least 50 percent. Most
oat contracts advanced the limit for daily trading for the fourth
consecutive session.
   Soybean futures began falling sharply at around noon CDT after
the price for July delivery reached $10.99{ a bushel. Corn and
wheat followed suit.
   ``The quote machines could not keep up,'' Ms. Leow said. ``I was
seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the market was
trading. I would not be compeletely shocked if we saw a record
volume day today.''
   At the close, wheat was 6{ cents lower to 5 cents higher with
July at $3.80 a bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 3{ cents higher
with July at $3.48 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher
with July at $3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 24{ cents lower to 20
cents higher with July at $10.30 a bushel.

   The stock market retreated slightly today in
moderate trading, weakened by investors cashing profits from the
strong gains of the previous two sessions.
   Some traders were disheartened by what they called the market's
failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began late Tuesday
and carried over into Wednesday. They said it reflected a
reluctance by a broad range of investors to commit significant
money to the market.
   But others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat
should be regarded as a positive sign of underlying strength.
   ``The back-to-back days of the magnitude we had are probably
some cause for some profit-taking,'' said John J. Muldowney, head
of equity and over-the-counter trading at Scott & Stringfellow Inc.
in Richmond, Va. ``I'm not at all discouraged by this.''

<HEAD>EEC Executive Says Britain Is Obstacle To European Central Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community may be
unable to create a European central bank until Britain changes its
stance on monetary cooperation, says Jacques Delors, the EEC's
chief executive.
   Delors, president of the EEC's commission, said Thursday it was
difficult to imagine creating such an institution as long as
Britain refuses to join the exchange-rate mechanism of the
eight-nation European Monetary System.
   The EMS was established in 1979 to minimize fluctuations in the
exchange values of its members' currencies. Britain has said it
might be willing to join the system in the future, but it has been
cool to the idea of a central bank.
   Delors told a news conference that a meeting of EEC government
leaders next Monday and Tuesday in Hanover, West Germany, would
discuss prospects for establishing a true European monetary and
currency union, including a European central bank.
   EEC officials have indicated they do not expect the meeting to
produce any decision on creating such a bank.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will chair the Hanover
summit, would propose that a group of ``wise men'' be set up to
study the central bank issue and to draw up specific plans, Delors
said.
   The EEC has set a goal of eliminating all barriers to free
movement of goods, money and people among its 12 member nations by
Dec. 31, 1992.

   Consumer electronics aren't just for yuppies, an
industry group said Thursday in releasing a Gallup survey that
found nearly two-thirds of American homes owned a videocassette
recorder.
   Ownership of VCRs has mushroomed to 65 percent of U.S.
households, said the Electronic Industries Association, which
sponsored the nationwide telephone survey of 1,008 adults this
spring.
   Televisions, which topped the popularity list, were owned by 99
percent of the households surveyed.
   Among other items included in the survey, telephone answering
machines were in 24 percent of the homes, personal computers in 18
percent and compact disk players in 14 percent.
   Some people even claimed to have facsimile machines at home _
about 1 percent, the Gallup Organization survey found.
   ``Our products are not luxuries owned by a privileged, select
few,'' Thomas P. Friel, vice president of the trade organization's
Consumer Electronics Group, said in a news conference.
   Not surprisingly, the survey found the households with the
highest incomes had the most consumer electronics products. But it
wasn't just rich singles. Ownership was higher among families with
children. For example, about 78 percent of families with children
had VCRs, while only 40 percent of single-member households did.
   In general, ownership of consumer electronics products was
higher in the East and West than in the Midwest or South.
   For example, telephone answering machines were in 36 percent of
households in the West and 27 percent in the East. They were in 19
percent of the households in the South and 17 percent of those in
the Midwest, the survey found.
   On televisions, the survey found that 31 percent of households
owned one, 33 percent owned two and 35 percent owned three or more.
Forty-three percent of households with children own three or more
televisions.
   Questions asked of the whole group have a margin of error of 4
percentage points, while questions asked of subgroups have higher
error margins, a Gallup spokesman said.
   Since it was a survey done by phone, the results are valid only
for homes with telephones _ people without phones would tend to own
less consumer electronics equipment.

   Assets of the nation's 439 money market mutual
funds rose $908.7 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to $266.28 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $1.88 billion decline in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's decline had initially been reported as $2.45
billion.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds increased $281 million to
$81.83 billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds increased $169
million to $113.5 billion, and assets of 122 institutional funds
rose $458.7 million to $70.95 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.56 percent from 6.50 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.46 percent from 6.39 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
36 days, down from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was 5.73
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was also unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.11
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.45 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.44
percent; 7.83 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.82 percent; and
8.26 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.25 percent.

   The dollar gyrated in world trading Thursday but
managed to finish mostly higher on key markets, maintaining its
recent gains amid profit- taking and rumors of central bank action
to keep the currency in line.
   Still, traders acknowledged that despite the recent rally,
nothing fundamentally has changed to ensure a continued increase in
the dollar's value.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price of $447.90 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down from $448.80 late Wednesday.
   The dollar opened higher when the day's trading began in Asia,
but analysts said the Bank of Japan quickly began calling traders
in an attempt to dampen their enthusiasm for the U.S. currency. The
dollar quickly retreated when traders learned the Bank of Japan was
unhappy with the currency's level and was monitoring the situation.
   When trading shifted to Europe, however, the dollar resumed its
climb in an unusually volatile session.
   Dealers in London said there was no apparent reason for the
rise, although most concurred that positive sentiment following
this week's economic summit in Toronto and a positive U.S. trade
report for April helped support the currency.
   Traders in New York downplayed indications that the major
industrialized democracies would tolerate a higher dollar.
   ``What is a slightly higher dollar?'' Ted Wolicki, a trader at
Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co. in Chicago asked rhetorically.
   ``If the dollar is nudged up, it will have to be slow and
gradual. It's come up a bit too quickly over the past few trading
days,'' he noted.
   James McGroarty, vice president at Discount Corp., said the
dollar did not have enough momentum to test the psychologically
important levels of 130 Japanese yen and 1.80 West German marks.
   ``Generally in North America there was a lack of appetite to
drive the dollar sharply higher,'' he said. ``To push it higher, we
needed fundamental news, and we didn't have any.''
   While the dollar was off for most of the domestic trading
session, a late wave of buying by Australian and New Zealand
investors helped the currency finish mostly higher, said Robert
Ryan, senior trader at Irving Trust Co.
   Analysts said that while the dollar may be headed higher in the
long term, it is unlikely to test key levels on the upside until
the release of the next set of U.S. trade figures, which could
serve as a springboard for a further advance.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before the European day begins, the
dollar rose 0.95 yen to close at 128.55 yen, up from Wednesday's
127.60. Later in London, it was quoted at 128.70 yen. In New York,
the dollar closed at 128.62 yen, off slightly from 128.95 yen on
Wednesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In London, the
pound fetched $1.7565, down from $1.7710 late Wednesday. In New
York, it cost $1.7552 to buy one pound, cheaper than Wednesday's
$1.7658.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.7850 West German marks, up from 1.7818;
1.4763 Swiss francs, up from 1.4747; 6.0050 French francs, up from
6.0025, 1,323.88 Italian lire, up from 1,3202.75, and 1.2022
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2102.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.7855 West German marks, up from 1.7740; 1.4800 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4720; 6.0245 French francs, up from 5.9747;
2.0145 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9975; 1,326.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,314.50, and 1.2030 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2100.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, one troy ounce of gold
bullion finished at $447.70, down from Wednesday's price of $449.50.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $448.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $448.50. Gold finished at $448.50 a
troy ounce in Zurich, unchanged from Wednesday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold fell $1.68 to close at a bid $449.78.
   Silver eased on New York's Comex to $6.967 a troy ounce, from
$7.177 on Wednesday. In London, the metal was trading at a late bid
price of $7.02 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $7.06.

   Common Market leaders should remove
obstacles to airline mergers by carriers based in different member
nations, Western European aviation experts said Thursday at a
seminar here.
   ``Far-reaching liberalization of the airline industry is
essential to ensure a free flow of goods and services within the
EEC,'' Hans Raben, head of the Dutch civil aviation agency, told a
news conference. ``And it is crystal-clear that obstacles against
international mergers must be removed.''
   He spoke at the end of the day-long seminar in this southern
Dutch town on the future of the airline industry in the
deregulated, liberalized Common Market envisioned after 1992.
   The conference, convened by Dutch Transport Minister Neelie
Smit-Kroes, drew 40 representatives from Common Market airlines,
civil aviation authorities and governments.
   The European Economic Community has a 1992 goal of removing all
trade barriers among its members, including Western Europe's
patchwork of bilateral aviation agreements.
   Although some nations, notably Britain and the Netherlands,
already have liberalized aviation agreements, most European
countries severely limit the freedom of operation for foreign
airlines.
   After 1992, European airlines would be free to choose their
destinations and flight frequencies. Experts at the seminar
predicted that only a few very large carriers will be able to
survive.
   Seminar participants heard a report by the International
Foundation of Airline Passenger Associations on possible effects of
European airline mergers on the flying public. The Dutch Transport
Ministry commissioned the report by the private, Geneva-based
organization.
   In the report, IFAPA's executive director Geoffrey Lipman said
EEC members should maintain some regulations to safeguard airline
passengers. He said that after the 1978 deregulation of civil
aviation in the United States, passenger complaints on congestion,
delays and bad service mushroomed.
   Raben said that while the U.S. government abolished many of the
regulations affecting the airline industry in one move, ``we're
planning a gradual change in Europe.''

   The world's sudden enthusiasm for the dollar is
built on the vicissitudes of guesswork and opinion, and it may not
last.
   After months of stability, the dollar has jumped about 3 percent
against the Japanese yen and 4 percent against the West German mark
since June 10.
   Investors who used to treat the U.S. currency as a sick patient
are speculating about how high it might rise.
   Many analysts are happy to explain why they believe the dollar's
rise is long overdue and well-justified, but watertight
explanations have proven notoriously leaky in the past.
   Certainly there have been some reasonable theories for the
increase in the dollar's value.
   For example:
   _A sharp improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
the month of April raised hopes that the nation was on a steady
path to balanced trade.
   _Japan reported extremely strong economic growth in early 1988,
raising the possibility that Japanese inflation would increase and
undermine the value of the yen. In another potential inflation
signal, the Japanese and West German money supplies have been
growing rapidly.
   _The finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations left open the possibility that they would tolerate a
further increase in the dollar's value.
   But those explanations (and others) notwithstanding, the latest
dollar rise is more of a quirk than a response to fundamentals.
   The truth is that no one is certain what the dollar's
``natural'' value is _ if there is even such a thing. After all,
history shows the dollar can swing a long way from equilibrium.
   In early 1985 the dollar was worth twice what it is worth now in
terms of yen and marks. In light of that experience, who can say
for sure it is properly valued now?
   Although the latest pressure on the dollar has been upward, one
group of economists says it should fall another 15 or 20 percent.
   Psychology _ the mass psychology of the markets _ is the real
reason for the dollar's latest move.
   Traders who make a living by trading currencies were bored and
frustrated by the months of stability in the dollar. Some of them
undoubtedly made profits by engineering a rally in the dollar.
   The dollar's strength is new and it could be short-lived.
   As recently as the first quarter of this year, private investors
were so chary of the dollar that foreign central banks were forced
to finance more than 60 percent of the U.S. current account deficit.
   Foreign official assets in the United States rose $25 billion in
the three-month period, more than in any quarter of 1987, notes
Carol Stone, senior economist of Nomura Securities International
Inc.
   Sometime around April, Ms. Stone said, ``There was a massive
change in psychology.'' Suddenly, she said, private foreign
investors decided they weren't afraid to hold dollars.
   ``It's one of the virtuous-circle kind of things. The dollar has
remained stable, so people think the dollar will continue to remain
stable. It just keeps feeding on itself.''
   Virtuous circles can quickly change to vicious circles.
   ``As long as you are dependent on foreign capital inflows, the
dollar is extremely vulnerable,'' noted Jai P. Bajaj, chief
economist of New York Life Insurance Co.
   Yes, he said, it is possible that the United States will move
surely and steadily from trade deficit to trade surplus by sometime
in 1990. Congress and the next administration may make steady
progress on reducing the federal budget deficit.
   But then again, ill-timed moves in Washington or a sudden
deterioration in the trade account could inspire a run on the
dollar, Bajaj said.
   ``You can very easily fracture foreign confidence in U.S.
economic management,'' he said. ``I see lots of slippages. Lots of
danger.''

   The stock market retreated slightly Thursday in
moderate trading, weakened by investors cashing profits from the
strong gains of the previous two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which had risen
nearly 70 points over Tuesday and Wednesday to the highest level
since the October crash, lost 3.91 points to close at 2,148.29.
Broader indexes were largely lower.
   Some traders were disheartened by what they called the market's
failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began two days
earlier. They said it reflected a reluctance by a broad range of
investors to commit significant money to the market for a prolonged
period.
   ``When a market or a stock breaks out and it's in good shape,
what you normally do is at for least several days put some legs
under it,'' said Paul Campbell, a vice president and market
technician at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New York.
``So I would have to argue that at least so far, the fact we're
unable to follow through is a negative, not a positive.''
   Others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat should
be regarded as a sign of underlying strength.
   ``The back-to-back days of the magnitude we had are probably
some cause for some profit-taking,'' said John J. Muldowney, head
of equity and over-the-counter trading at Scott & Stringfellow Inc.
in Richmond, Va. ``I'm not at all discouraged by this.''
   Others said they expected large institutional investors and
money managers to put cash into stocks over the next several
sessions to bolster portfolios before the quarter ends June 30.
That development likely would raise prices.
   In addition, they said foreigners likely will be increasingly
attracted to U.S. stocks if the dollar's strength is sustained.
That would be another positive for the stock market.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about an 8-to-7 ratio
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 803 issues down, 708 up and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 185.77 million shares,
down from 217.51 million in the previous session. More than 21
million shares of the volume Thursday was due to dividend-capture
trading strategies in Commonwealth Edison, which rose \ to 28|.
   IBM was the most prominent blue-chip issue, surging 2} to 125}
after having gained nearly 6 in the previous two sessions.
   GAF fell 1} to 46] after reports emerged that the company was

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,

   The NYSE index composite index of all listed issues fell 0.32 to

   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.92 to 317.58,

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
tumbled in mid-June, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell
$2.1 billion in the week ended June 13 to a seasonally adjusted
$771.8 billion from $773.9 billion the previous week.
   It said the measure known as M2 fell $4.8 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,013 billion from $3,018 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell $1.8 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,794 billion from $3,796 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   The central bank considers the two broader measures of the money
supply as well as the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates in setting
its monetary policy.
   But most economists say that recent movements in the money
supply do not appear to have played a very significant role in
those deliberations.
   In other reports Thursday:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $952 million in
the week ended June 15, compared with a gain of $133 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said discount window borrowings, excluding
extended credit, averaged $498 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, down from $562 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $278.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $276.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   Mexico's stock market reeled Thursday after a
shake-up at the Mexican Stock Exchange, where the director, the
operations chief and billions of missing pesos had to be replaced.
   Exchange officials said Wednesday they had accepted the
resignations of Director-General Mario Segura Quiroz and Operations
Director Reynaldo Hernandez Balsaldua, who has been in a coma since
attempting suicide last month.
   Guillermo Nunez, who was once vice president of the exchange's
regulatory agency, was named interim director-general.
   Officials also said they were revamping the exchange's controls,
finances, administration and operations.
   The volatile market promptly nose-dived, closing down 10,968.95
points, about 5.45 percent.
   ``It's a big drop. There's no question,'' said Timothy Heyman,
author of a Mexican best-seller on investing and head of investment
strategy at a leading brokerage house here.
   Some analysts blamed the stock exchange's fall, at least in
part, on the scandal, saying it had shaken investor confidence.
Others called it an expected correction.
   ``There's never just one reason for things to happen,'' Heyman
said in a telephone interview. ``The market has risen rather
sharply since mid-May, from 144,000 to 203,000 _ about 33 percent.
We expected a correction.''
   The reorganization came after an audit revealed the exchange was
missing at least 15.7 billion pesos of its own _ not investors' _
money, or about $7 million.
   It is still not clear whether the money vanished through fraud,
mismanagement or a combination of the two. Exchange officials say
the shortage could reach 20 billion pesos or more.
   Exchange President Alfredo Harp Helu said Wednesday that the
condition of the operations director, in a coma since shooting
himself on May 13 at the exchange, has ``blocked a precise
understanding of'' what happened to the money.
   Last year, the Mexican market was one of the world's hottest.
But it fell 74 percent in 28 trading days following the worldwide
stock crash in mid-October. Officials have been struggling to
restore confidence in the market and minimize the growing scandal.
   In addition to the reorganization, members of the exchange
replaced the missing money and agreed to a code of ethics.
   Some critics have complained about the exchange's failure to
turn the case over to judicial authorities for a criminal
investigation.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge On Break In Drought-Fear Fever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices dropped sharply Tuesday in frenzied
trading that pushed the July contract to a 15-year high near $11 a
bushel before uncertainty about the weather caused a nervous wave
of selling.
   Corn and wheat futures also retreated on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while oats advanced the permissable limit for the fourth
consecutive session and hit new record highs on fears of further
damage to the drought-ravaged crop.
   On other markets, cotton futures plunged; livestock and meat
futures fell steeply; energy futures were mixed; precious metals
were lower and stock-index futures also lost ground.
   ``We're trading hysteria right now,'' Cathy Leow, a New
York-based grain analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.,
said of the soybean market's erratic performance.
   The Chicago grain and soybean markets opened sharply higher on
fears of deepening drought damage, but only oat futures sustained
the bullish momentum on reports estimating oat yield losses of at
least 50 percent.
   Soybean futures began falling sharply at midday after the price
for July had traded up the 45-cent limit to $10.99{ a bushel. Corn
and wheat rapidly followed suit.
   ``I was seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the
market was trading,'' Ms. Leow said.
   Ms. Leow said she knew of no change in weather forecasts and
blamed the selloff on a loss of nerve among inexperieced
speculators.
   But Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc., said some traders were worried that storms in the
Gulf of Mexico could spawn a hurricane that might eventually bring
some moisture to the Farm Belt.
   ``The market is so nervous right now that even the remote
possibility of rain was enough to trigger the big selloff today,''
Balletto said.
   Ms. Leow said some traders suddenly realized the enormity of
their risk and decided to take profits.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 6{ cents lower with July at $3.80{ a
bushel; corn was 7 cents lower to 3{ cents higher with July at
$3.48 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher with July at
$3.48 a bushel; soybeans were 23{ cents lower to 6{ cents higher
with July at $10.32{ a bushel.
   Most cotton futures plunged their 2-cents-a-pound daily limit on
the New York Cotton Exchange, primarily in reaction to the drop in
soybean prices, said Ed Whitten, cotton specialist in New York with
Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Cotton for July delivery settled 2 cents lower at 66.40 cents a
pound.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures
continued to move in the opposite direction of the grains on the
theory that high feed prices and lack of grazing land will force
cattle and pork producers to send more animals to slaughter,
analysts said.
   Cattle and pork futures fell the limit early in the day, then
rose from their lows later in the session as soybean prices fell.
   Live cattle were unchanged to 1.10 cents lower with August at
62.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .80 cent to 1.27 cents
lower with August at 69.77 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
the limit 1.50 cents lower with July at 44.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .45 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with July at
40 cents a pound.
   Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with near-term gasoline contracts up sharply on the drought-induced
shipping slowdown on the Mississippi River, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 15
cents higher with August at $16.37 a barrel; heating oil was .08
cent lower to .32 cent higher with July at 43.94 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .01 cent to .66 cent higher with July at
51.06 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures dipped slightly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   Gold was $1.80 to $2.10 lower with August at $450.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.6 cents lower with July at $6.985
a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures slipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for September delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled .80 point lower at 277.15.

<HEAD>Shareholders Approve Restaurant Chain Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Shoney's Inc. on Thursday
approved a $730 million recapitalization plan, which management
says will enable the chain of family restaurants to strengthen its
business without expanding.
   Under the plan, which was first announced in March, stockholders
will receive $16 in cash and $4 in securities for each share and
retain ownership of the stock.
   Financing will be provided through a syndicate of banks led by
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Other syndicate members
include Chase Manhattan Bank, Mellon Bank, Bank of New York, Bank
of Nova Scotia and Sovran Bank.
   With 1987 sales of $700 million, Shoney's operates and
franchises more than 1,500 family-style restaurants in 30 states
and employs about 25,000 people. It is based in Nashville, Tenn.
   Company executives said when the plan was first announced that
it was designed to shift the company's emphasis from growth through
expansion to growth through improved profit margins at existing
locations.
   In a statement after shareholder approval Thursday, the lead
financing bank said in a statement from New York that the
recapitalization would enable Shoney's to ``respond to the maturing
of the family restaurant industry.''

<HEAD>EPA Files Suits Against Chrysler, Other Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
filed lawsuits Thursday against Chrysler Corp. and 11 other
companies or individuals to recover more than $4 million in cleanup
costs for two hazardous waste sites in Delaware and Pennsylvania.
   James M. Seif, regional administrator of EPA's Region III office
in Philadelphia, said cleanup had begun at both sites and some
companies had already settled with EPA for cleanup costs.
   ``We're sending a message to those who have not settled,'' he
said at a news conference. ``We go to court to ensure others to
settle.''
   In Pennsylvania, the EPA is suing 10 companies for $982,000 plus
25 percent of future cleanup costs of the McAdoo site in Schuylkill
County, Seif said. The site, located in Kline Township, covers
about eight acres and was used for deep and strip mining of coal.
   The Harvey and Knott Drum site in Kirkwood, Del., was used as an
open dump and burning ground, Seif said. The EPA suit, filed in
federal court in Delaware against Chrysler Corp. and Knotts Inc.,
seeks $3.3 million and one-third of EPA's future oversight costs
for cleanup of the two-acre site, he said.
   Seif said General Motors Corp. previously agreed to perform
cleanup at the Harvey and Knott site and will be reimbursed for
one-third of the cleanup costs.
   The Pennsylvania suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Judge Finds No Evidence Union Staged Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Thursday he found no
evidence the Association of Flight Attendants instigated a massive
overtime boycott at USAir, which was forced to cancel 179 flights
over the Memorial Day holiday.
   Although U.S. District Judge Robert Standish said the refusal of
many flight attendants to work overtime during the three-day
weekend was ``part of a concerted refusal to fly,'' he said
evidence was insufficient to prove the union ordered or encouraged
such a job action.
   The judge stopped short, however, of denying USAir's request for
a preliminary injunction barring future overtime boycotts. He said
he would issue a ruling on the airline's request Friday.
   Although neither side would claim victory or defeat, flight
attendants union attorney Deborah Greenfield said, ``Clearly he
(Standish) hasn't found any proof of union involvement so far.''
   USAir spokesman David Shipley declined to comment on the judge's
actions until a ruling is issued. He said the airline has no plans
to change its long-standing tradition of scheduling overtime for
its flight attendants.
   About 11,000 passengers were affected when hundreds of flight
attendants refused to work overtime during Memorial Day. The
airline said it lost an estimated $1.1 million.
   USAir officials testified during the two-day hearing that about
one-third of the airline's flight attendants routinely work more
than the 85 hours a month mandated by their contract.
   Under their two-year pact, which expires in August, USAir's
3,000 flight attendants can choose to work up to, but no more than,
95 hours a month.
   USAir sued the union last week amid stalled contract
negotiations with the 1,000 flight attendants of Pacific Southwest
Airlines, which merged with USAir in April.
   Flight attendants union spokeswoman Dee Maki said major
unresolved issues in the negotiations, which began in July and
currently are being mediated, include an airline proposal to pay
Pacific Southwest Airlines' former attendants at a different rate
than USAir's.
   USAir has a two-tiered pay system for its flight attendants, and
the proposal for Pacific Southwest Airlines workers would create
two additional tiers until parity is attained in three years, she
said.
   If USAir could have proved union involvement in the Memorial Day
job action, the flight attendants union could have been in
violation of the federal Railway Labor Act, which prohibits
organized work slowdowns, strikes, sickouts and other such actions
during contract negotiations.
   On Thursday, Ms. Maki testified she told attendants at union
meetings and in written memos in May that extra flying time was
voluntary but did not try to discourage members from working
overtime.
   ``We told them we will not sponsor anything like that,'' she
said.
   But USAir attorney Thomas Reinert said impromptu notices posted
in crew lounges encouraging an overtime boycott and statements Ms.
Maki made to the press expressing her delight over the job action
were evidence of union involvement.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
said Thursday it has asked federal regulators for permission to
begin an electronic bulletin board for price quotations of
low-volume, over-the-counter stocks.
   The NASD currently runs an automated quotation system for
high-volume stocks, but lists prices for smaller stocks by paper in
the so-called ``pink sheets.''
   The association told the Securities and Exchange Commission that
the new bulletin board system, which it wants to operate for a
six-month trial, would cover about 7,000 of the 20,000 to 30,000
pink sheet stocks.
   Many of the issues are low-priced, but some, although traded
thinly or held by only a few owners, are high-priced, it said.
   ``The proposed electronic bulletin board will bring new
visibility and orderliness to (a) large and heterogeneous market,''
NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman said in a statement. It is
expected to speed the process of trading the stocks.
   The NASD said it hopes to get SEC approval for a trial run in
time to begin between July and September.

<HEAD>Indian Government Files Contempt Petition Against Union Carbide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government lawyers on Thursday filed a
contempt of court petition against Union Carbide Corp. for
demanding that a judge in the district court be removed from his
position, the United News of India reported.
   A.M. Mathur, the advocate general of Madhya Pradesh state, filed
the petition in the state High Court in Jabalpur, the news agency
said. Jabalpur is 347 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The petition said a Union Carbide request that Bhopal District
Judge M.W. Deo excuse himself from hearing the lawsuit against the
giant U.S. chemical company amounted to contempt of court.
   The Indian government has filed a $3 billion suit against Union
Carbide for a toxic gas leak from one of its subsidiary pesticide
plants in Bhopal, India. The gas leak in December 1984 killed
nearly 3,000 people and injured more than 20,000 others, in the
world's worst industrial disaster.
   Judge Deo ruled last December that Union Carbide must pay $192
million to the gas victims as ``interim relief.''
   The ruling, upheld by the state high court, was termed unfair by
Union Carbide because, the company said, Deo had not ruled on the
merits of the case. Union Carbide lawyers then filed an application
asking Deo to excuse himself.
   Deo in a ruling last week refused to dissociate himself from the
case, saying there were no legal grounds for the request.
   The contempt of court application Thursday said that Union
Carbide's request was a direct attack on Deo and an attempt to
intimidate him. It was designed to obstruct the course of justice,
the petition said.

<HEAD>Court Orders Rockwell, Two Individuals To Produce Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. and two
employees have been ordered to show why they aren't in contempt of
court for failing to provide documents to a federal grand jury.
   A Rockwell spokesman issued a terse statement late Thursday
denying that the incident is related to a major investigation into
Pentagon procurement practices and saying the company believes it
has now resolved the dispute.
   The order, signed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge David Hansen
and released Thursday, did not provide much insight into the
matter, as Hansen ordered other court documents sealed to preserve
the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.
   The order instructed David Gilbert, whom the company later
identified as an employee of its Collins Government Avionics
Division, to appear next Monday in federal court to show why he
should not be held in civil contempt of court for failing to honor
a June 15 order requiring production of original computer tapes.
That order was, in turn, a response to a grand jury subpoena of
Rockwell on May 25, the court order said.
   It also orders both the company and Gary Black, Rockwell's
assistant general counsel, to show why they shouldn't be held in
both civil and criminal contempt for the same reason. Judge Hansen
gave the men and the company until 4:30 p.m. Friday to respond.
   The avionics division makes electronic aviation communications
and navigation equipment for military use.
   The court order declared ``everything except this order to be
sealed, including records of preceding court matters, to preserve
secrecy of the grand jury.''
   Company spokesman Mike Humbert later released a statement from
Rockwell that said:
   ``This matter has nothing to do with the government
investigation reported to be underway in Washington, D.C. The only
issue here is a misunderstanding between the Collins Government
Avionics Division and the Cedar Rapids U.S. attorney concerning the
government's right of access to information concerning our
commercial businesses. We believe that matter has been resolved.''
   He declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Kickoff of Big Antitrust Suit Against Insurance Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tough-talking federal judge on Thursday
kicked off pre-trial sessions of a massive, 18-state antitrust
lawsuit against some of the nation's major insurance companies,
accused of a conspiracy to cut liability coverage for government
and business.
   Reporters were told there could be as many as 15 more plaintiffs
_ presently unnamed companies from around the country _ before the
complex case goes to trial years from now.
   California Deputy Attorney General Thomas Greene, leading the
plaintiffs, said after the two-hour session that he would ``be
happy'' if the trial could begin three years from now. The states
are asking for unspecified damages and an injunction to prevent the
insurers from repeating alleged violations.
   A major contributor to the insurance crisis was ``an illegal
boycott,'' because the companies pressured the Insurance Services
Office, a 1,400-member industry trade group, to quit distributing
standard forms to make it difficult for individual companies to
continue offering certain liability coverage.
   There will be no emotional, jury-type pleadings, only the facts,
U.S. District Court Judge William W. Schwarzer warned a huge
ceremonial courtroom of more than 100 lawyers representing the
plaintiffs and 32 insurance companies, underwriting agencies and
brokers.
   ``There will be no duplicate arguments,'' the judge sternly
ordered.
   The opening session was the lawsuit's status conference, roughly
the judge's procedural ``road map'' aimed at narrowing the issues,
setting rules and limits for discovery, and naming motion, argument
and hearing dates leading to trial.
   San Francisco attorney Guido Severi said he anticipated that 14
or 15 more plaintiffs would be joining the action. He said a
multi-district panel would decide how the new complaints would be
heard.
   Schwarzer, referring to himself as a ``resource'' of the case
forced to limit the volume of documents laid before him,
strenuously resisted efforts to convince him to handle defendants
on an individual basis.
   Some defense lawyers estimated that the plaintiffs' two years of
investigation had produced 100,000 pages and that the companies
were entitled to see them as part of discovery. The judge said he
wasn't so sure of that.
   The judge limited to 25 pages pleadings pertaining to the law,
principally the McCarran-Ferguson Act, that says insurance
companies can't be sued for antitrust violations unless conspiracy
is involved.
   The plaintiff states are California, Maryland, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado, Montana,
Washington, Alaska, Michigan, Massachusetts, West Virginia,
Arizona, Alabama, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Texas filed a similar
suit in its own state court.
   Regarding discovery _ information either side is entitled to
learn about the other's case _ the judge said he would take ``a dim
view'' of efforts aimed at ``broad exploratory'' disclosures.
   ``Discovery is limited to issues that are essential to deal with
the issues on both sides,'' ruled Schwarzer, one of the nation's
most respected jurists on management of issues of disclosure.
   The judge ordered a limit of six months for discovery, all
motions to be filed by Dec. 16, state responses on April 18, 1989;
arguments June 16, 1989, and a hearing July 7, 1989.
   The leading defendants are Hartford Fire Insurance Co., Allstate
Insurance Co., Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., and Cigna Corp. They
are accused of arranging among themselves, starting around 1984, to
make liability insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
   ``Anti-consumer revisions were made in the (forms) as a result
of boycotts, threats, intimidation and other coercive conduct by
the defendants,'' said the California complaint by state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp.

   The Writers Guild of America voted
3-1 to reject the latest contract offered by movie and television
producers and to continue its 4-month-old strike, union officials
said Thursday.
   The producers' alliance immediately responded by declaring there
was nothing more to negotiate and that it would produce as many
fall TV shows as possible, and begin layoffs if unable to complete
the schedule.
   ``Negotiations with the Writers Guild have concluded,'' said
Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers. ``We have nothing else to discuss with the
Writers Guild. No further meetings are scheduled.''
   Other than a few shows whose producers have signed contracts
independent of the alliance for such programs as ``The Cosby Show''
and ``The Tonight Show,'' virtually all fall entertainment
programming is threatened by the strike.
   The writers voted was 2,789 to 933, or 74.9 percent in favor of
rejection and 25.1 percent in favor of acceptance.
   ``We remain ready, willing and able to conclude negotiations,''
union President George Kirgo said.
   Kirgo said the rejected offer was substantially better than the
preceding two offers and he credited chief executive officers of
major studios ``who joined with us in attempting to end this
strike.''
   Steinberg said the only further talks would have to be ``a
telephone call saying they're willing to sign the strike settlement
offer as is.''
   ``We are now moving ahead to produce as many programs as we can.
We will do everything we can to get the town back to work. If we
cannot produce our fall schedules in their entirety we will curtail
operations as required.''
   Steinberg said that meant layoffs and shutting down facilities.
   ``The message to the companies is loud and clear,'' said Mona
Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild, East. ``Our
members want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike.
If the companies end their inflexibility, which forced the strike
and prolonged it, we can end this strike quickly and put everyone
in our industry back to work.''
   Ballots were cast during an often tumultuous membership meeting
Wednesday night in Los Angeles and another gathering in New York.
   Writers opposing rejection of the proposed contract had conceded
they would lose, but hoped to get enough votes to convince union
negotiators to end the strike quickly. The union has 9,500 members.
   The Writers Coalition, a union anti-strike group that includes
some of Hollywood's top writer-producers, had said that 600 to 700
votes for the pact would compel union negotiators to listen to the
coalition, said a coalition spokesman who talked on condition of
anonymity.
   ``There is no victory here,'' said coalition member Lionel
Chetwynd. ``The strike goes on. We're all losing.''
   Business people from lighting suppliers to restaurant and deli
owners said Thursday the contract's rejection would hurt.
   ``If the television shows don't show up in August and September,
the whole industry will be hurting,'' said John Clairmont, whose
Clairmont Cameras supplies television crews.
   Members voted in person or by proxy on the latest offer from the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, an umbrella
group representing about 200 studios.
   Chief union negotiator Brian Walton received a standing ovation
late Wednesday when he told the crowded meeting inside the
Hollywood Palladium ``I think the strike will end sooner and it
will end on fairer terms'' if the latest offer is rejected.
   The rancorous meeting included shouted obscenities, hallway
arguments and booed-down speakers as it moved into the late night
hours.
   Producers claim their four-year package will be worth an extra
$71 million to writers and offers an across-the-board increase in
residuals of 14.7 percent. Payments to writers at present total
about $360 million a year, producers' spokesman Herb Steinberg said.
   The guild claims its negotiators accepted a flexible formula for
payment on one-hour televison shows sold for reruns but was not
rewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas. The
union has linked the two items in an economic package.
   With the new production season upcoming, lack of a contract
could hurt businesses who deal with major production companies that
have not signed independent contracts with the guild.
   Other firms, which have dealt largely with independent
production companies that have signed seperate contracts or hired
non-union crews, have said the strike has had little or no effect.
   ``Some are hurting and some are cleaning up with all the
non-union work this has created. When this strike started, we
started shipping tons of equipment to Canada,'' said Ed Phillips,
president of Matthews Co., a Burbank firm that supplies camera and
lighting equipment.
   Ron Dahlquist, president of Key Lite, said his firm supplies
lighting equipment to the major studios and has been affected.
   ``We have had quite a bit of slowdown. We've had to lay people
off and had a slowdown of production,'' Dahlquist said.
   ``We have gone through this before,'' said Dahlquist. ``There
will be some independent productions, regardless of a strike. And
there is usually a tremendous surge after the strike is over, and
that more than makes up for the losses.''
   At Art's Deli in Studio City, near the Universal Studios lot,
owner Art Ginsburg bemoaned empty lunchtime tables.
   ``We are off a good 10-to-15 percent,'' he said. ``Not only are
the writers and producers not coming in, but also the agents
meeting with clients, the drivers, and all the related businesses.''

   Deputy Assistant Navy Secretary James Gaines,
suspected of being one of several Pentagon officials who smuggled
classified information to a defense consultant, has begun telling
prosecutors what he knows about the Pentagon corruption case,
sources said Thursday.
   ``There has been some interest shown on the part of some
individuals in cooperating with the investigation,'' said a Justice
Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said
some information ``has already been obtained.''
   According to other sources, Gaines, whose office was searched
last week, is believed to be one of several people who passed
procurement information to Pentagon official-turned-consultant
Melvyn Paisley.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that Paisley copied the
documents with the aid of his wife.
   Paisley allegedly passed the sensitive information along to his
major client, McDonnell Douglas Corp., said the sources.
   Paisley and Gaines worked together at the Boeing Co. in Seattle
in the 1970s.
   An attorney for the Paisleys, Lawrence Barcella, rejected the
accounts of the Paisleys' alleged activities and criticized the
government for leaking information about the investigation. He said
it is ironic that leaks are occurring ``in a case in which the
government is alleging improper disclosure of sensitive
information.''
   Meanwhile, a former Boeing Co. executive, James Durst, said he
passed along information to the government more than six years ago
that Paisley had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping
operation and of conducting bribery internationally on military
projects.
   Durst's information was contained in a Feb. 4, 1982 letter to
former Idaho Republican Gov. Don Samuelson, who gave it to Sen.
Paul Laxalt of Nevada, President Reagan's close friend, Durst said
in a telephone interview Thursday night. Laxalt said in an April
21, 1982 letter to Samuelson that the matter had been referred to
the Defense Department, said Durst, who said he has a copy of the
letter. ABC News reported Thursday on Durst's allegations and the
exchange of letters.
   Barcella called Durst's accusations ``unfounded'' and said the
FBI had conducted a full background check on Paisley before he was
appointed to the Pentagon post he left last year.
   At the heart of the investigation are allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts. Prosecutor Henry Hudson told
congressmen Wednesday he is looking into 75 to 100 contracts worth
``tens of billions of dollars.''
   While Gaines is talking with prosecutors, another Pentagon
official whose office was searched, Victor Cohen, is negotiating
with the government on whether to do the same, the sources said.
   Both Gaines and Cohen had key procurement jobs in the Pentagon.
Gaines was deputy assistant Navy secretary for acquisition
management while Cohen was a top aide to the deputy assistant Air
Force secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control,
communications and computer systems. Both men have been reassigned
since the investigation became public.
   At the White House, President Reagan told reporters Thursday he
has arranged for a report on the present status of the
investigation.
   Responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting
Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke, Reagan said, ``I am asking,
and have arranged _ they are coming over to give me a full
report.'' He said the report would deal with the question of
``where are we now and how much do we know already?''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Richard P. Godwin,
who was brought into the Pentagon as an undersecretary to reform
its procurement system, said former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger is ``100 percent wrong'' in defending the way the
Defense Department spends $160 billion a year on purchases of
weapons and other goods and services.
   ``We have institutionalized a bad system,'' said Godwin, who,
like Weinberger, had been an executive at the Bechtel Group, a vast
construction conglomerate.
   Godwin said he quit in frustration last fall after 18 months at
the Pentagon, where he was supposed to carry out reforms
recommended by a commission headed by California industrialist
David Packard.
   Weinberger told The AP on Wednesday he thought procurement
procedures in effect at the Pentagon ``are proper.''
   The FBI, meanwhile, said Thursday that it had searched several
more sites in the last two weeks that it had not revealed
previously, including Kane Paper Co. of Baldwin, N.Y., which was
searched this week.
   Last week, investigators searched the home and office of Dennis
Mitchell of Poquott, N.Y., who works in the surveillance and fire
control division of Unisys Corp.'s Great Neck, N.Y. plant, the FBI
said. The FBI had announced last week that it had searched that
Unisys plant as well as the Malverne, N.Y., home of Charles
Gardner, a former Unisys vice president.
   In addition, the FBI revealed Thursday that it had served search
warrants on Scott Lamberth of Farmington, Ark., who works with
Whittaker Corp., a defense electronics firm which had been searched
last week, and James Neal of Oakton, Va. It could not be determined
immediately if the agents had searched their homes or offices or
both.
   Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci held his first meeting with Hudson on Wednesday.
Carlucci, like Reagan and like Weinberger, was not briefed about
the affair until just before it became public knowledge.
   Howard declined to discuss the substance of the briefing
received by Carlucci from Hudson, the U.S. attorney for eastern
Virginia, or say how frequently the defense secretary expected to
be updated on the matter.
   The spokesman also acknowledged the Pentagon has not taken steps
yet to inhibit the business dealings of defense consultants whose
names have surfaced in the FBI probe.
   Earlier this week, Carlucci ordered Gaines, Cohen and four other
Pentagon officials identified in the investigation temporarily
reassigned to other jobs.
   ``We simply cannot take an action on the basis of press
reports,'' Howard said. ``Now, we have asked the Department of
Justice to inform us of the names of individuals who may be
involved in the investigation. The Department of Justice has
provided us with no names beyond the limited number in this
building.
   ``And until and unless we are given such information, we cannot
take any action. We will take appropriate steps at the appropriate
time. But we are in a kind of limbo here at the moment until this
investigation proceeds further,'' Howard said.
   Defense Department Inspector General June Gibbs Brown told
reporters she didn't consider the Pentagon a ``soft touch'' when it
came to contract fraud and thought the department was getting the
message across to industry that white-collar crime doesn't pay.
   The number of contractor suspensions and debarments has soared
from roughly 80 a year in 1981 to about 900 a year now and criminal
prosecutions also have climbed significantly, she said.
   ``I think we're doing a very aggressive job in this area,'' she
said, adding that the current probe ``is a perfect example of how
the system is working.''
   Prosecutor Hudson, meantime, dropped plans to release by Friday
the affidavits filed by FBI agents in support of requests for
search warrants. He had said earlier this week he hoped to unseal
them.
   Sharon Dibbley, a spokeswoman for Hudson, said ``we really
haven't set a time for releasing the search warrants and
affidavits.''
   ``Once the search warrants are returned, they are usually
opened,'' she noted. ``They will be, but not right now.''
   Asked the reason for the delay, she said, ``We don't feel it
would be beneficial to have them opened at this time.''
   Navy Secretary William Ball discussed the case Thursday with the
Senate Armed Services Committee and several other senators and
chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., later announced that hearings will be
held after Congress' July 4 recess on the military's contracting
system ``to find whether there are a few rotten apples or many
rotten applies or basic flaws in the procurement system.''
   The House Armed Services Committee tentatively scheduled
hearings for next week on the procurement system.
