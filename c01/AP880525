<HEAD>Heavy List of Amendments Slows Cooperative Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Parliament on Wednesday put off voting
on a progressive tax on people who work for private cooperatives, a
key element of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Such a move by the Supreme Soviet, which normally approves laws
that have been put forward by the ruling Communist Party, is very
unusual. It may reflect concern about the contents of the law as
well as a greater willingness to speak out under Gorbachev's policy
of greater openness.
   The two chambers of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament,
met in separate sessions Wednesday to debate the law, scheduled to
go into effect on July 1.
   The law also guarantees that cooperatives' property will not be
seized by the government.
   Officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system on
income earned by individuals who work in cooperatives is to get the
cooperatives to invest in expanding their businesses rather than
paying high salaries to workers.
   Gorbachev has pushed cooperatives as a method of augmenting the
state-run economy, which cannot provide enough consumer goods and
services.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said in a speech to the opening
session of the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday that the law was of
``immense social and political significance.''
   He said the cooperative system ``in a short time can solve the
most severe problems of perestroika (restructuring), the demand of
the population for goods and services.''
   The cooperative law was to have been brought before a joint
meeting of the Supreme Soviet on Wednesday, but officials at the
meeting said 22 parliamentarians spoke about the law in meetings of
the separate chambers Wednesday morning and that it was delayed
while a commission looked at a series of proposed amendments.
   Officials at the Supreme Soviet meeting gave no details of the
issues under debate, but the Tass news agency said in a report that
``judging by the deputies' remarks, the new edition of the law has
caused no objections of principle, while the amendments suggested
are dictated by the desire to protect cooperatives from unfounded
interference by local authorities.''
   ``Groundless limitations are introduced in many places, often
under the pretext of attempts to keep workers from leaving state
enterprises,'' Tass said. ``Another reason behind the limitations
is the bigoted idea that a cooperative is something to be looked
down at.''
   It said other problems facing cooperatives are the difficulty of
obtaining supplies and the system of taxation.
   Ryzhkov said Tuesday that 6,000 cooperatives had been formed in
the previous three months while the new law was being debated,
while a total of 14,000 had been formed in 18 months.
   Restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives
that have opened, and others have formed to make clothing, pump
gas, do apartment repairs and provide other services.

<HEAD>Pete Wilson Eyes `Jinx'; McCarthy Hoping for Upset</HEAD>

   Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy is
trailing in the polls and in fund raising, but he has one thing in
his favor as he seeks to unseat Republican Sen. Pete Wilson this
year _ ``The Jinx.''
   For more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to the Senate
seat Wilson holds. Incumbents have died, stepped down or been
defeated and descended into political oblivion. By contrast,
Democrat Alan Cranston is flourishing in his fourth term holding
down the state's other seat.
   ``Everybody talks about `The Jinx,''' said Craig Schmidt, a
Wilson aide. ``But this is the year `The Jinx' will be broken.''
Wilson, not surprisingly, agrees: ``I think it's nonsense, a myth.
We're going to prove it's not true.'
   The question of whether unlucky tradition will prevail may be
the most exciting thing about the race, which is generally viewed
as a showdown between two competent, conventional and largely
colorless politicians.
   Both men are youthful-looking, clean-cut candidates, with
reputations for personal honesty, and are perceived as moderates in
their respective parties.
   McCarthy, 57, a former San Francisco County supervisor who spent
14 years in the Legislature, including six years as Assembly
speaker, is expected to have no trouble defeating two little-known
challengers in the June 7 Democratic primary: Robert J. Banuelos, a
communications consultant from Orange, and Charles Greene of Los
Angeles.
   Wilson, 54-year-old former mayor of San Diego, is unopposed for
the GOP nomination.
   Since January 1987, Wilson has raised $4.7 million and spent
about $4 million, while McCarthy has raised $2.4 million and spent
$1.7 million. Both candidates say about 80 percent of their funds
will be used to buy television advertising, a critical resource in
this vast state which comprises 10 percent of the nation's
population.
   ``We've spent the recesses and the weekends campaigning,''
Wilson said in an interview earlier this month, perched on the rear
seat of a minivan zipping along Interstate 5. ``We've been out
virtually every weekend ... but it's literally impossible for me to
meet everybody.'' In one recent campaign swing, Wilson hit 13
cities in three days, targeting growers and business groups, while
McCarthy has been on the road with a no-frills whistle-stop-style
campaign from a motorhome.
   McCarthy said he has used the lieutenant governor's position to
push legislation for health care for the elderly, nursing home
improvements and child care programs. ``I think the elderly see me
as their No. 1 champion. This is a very significant area of
strength for me. This is something everyone concedes.
   ``But I don't exaggerate the power inherent in the lieutenant
governor's office,'' McCarthy added. ``I received far more media
attention when I was Assembly speaker.''
   The most recent statewide survey of California voters, a May 11
poll by the Gallup Organization, showed Wilson with a 21-point lead
over McCarthy, 51 percent to 30 percent, with 19 percent undecided.
   McCarthy, however, dismisses the polls, contending they largely
reflect Wilson's television advertising campaign.
   Since those polls, McCarthy received more bad news when a
phalanx of Hollywood film moguls, eight powerful studio chiefs,
endorsed Wilson. The studio bosses included several prominent
Democrats.
   McCarthy belittled the significance of the May 2 endorsements,
saying that such stars Morgan Fairchild, Jack Lemmon, Bruce Willis
and Warren Beatty remained loyal to him.
   At issue is a U.S. Senate seat that has traded hands
continuously since the 1950s.
   Moderate Democrat Clair Engle, who won the seat in 1958, died in
office, and John F. Kennedy's former press secretary, Pierre
Salinger, was appointed to complete his term.
   Salinger lost his 1964 election bid to Hollywood song-and-dance
man George Murphy, a conservative Republican who in turn was
defeated in 1970 by John Tunney, a Democrat and the son of boxer
Gene Tunney.
   In 1976, Tunney was defeated by former San Francisco State
University President S.I. Hayakawa, an acid-tongued, articulate
semanticist known for his hard-line approach to student protesters.
   In 1982, faced with week standings in the polls, Hayakawa
retired and was succeeded by Wilson.

<HEAD>`Hulk' Wins Ratings Battle with `Baby M'</HEAD>

   NBC racked up another win in the Nielsens thanks
to two ratings ``hulks'' _ one Lou Ferrigno and the other Bob Hope.
   ``The Incredible Hulk Returns,'' a reunion movie starring Bill
Bixby and Ferrigno as, respectively, a professor and his violent
alter ego, ranked fourth in the weekly Nielsens with a rating of
20.2 and a 33 share. Hope's special celebration of 50 years of
association with NBC finished in sixth with an 19.0 and 31.
   And NBC may have solved its Wednesday night ratings with an
``Unsolved Mysteries'' special that was also in the top 10 in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, at ninth, and is due to become a regular
weekly fixture in the fall.
   ABC's ``Baby M'' was no match for ``Hulk'' in a three-way
made-for-TV movie battle on Sunday. Part one of the two-parter
starring JoBeth Williams as Mary Beth Whitehead Gould had a 15.0
rating and 24 share and ranked 17th for the week.
   CBS came in third with ``My Father, My Son,'' starring Karl
Malden and Keith Carradine as Adm. Elmo Zumwalt and his son. It had
a 13.5 rating and 22 share and ranked 21st.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time
rating of 15.3. ABC was second with 11.6.
   CBS' 10.7 was its lowest weekly rating this season. Last week
was part of the important May sweeps, one of the four months a year
when television ratings companies measure viewership in local
markets. But with only a few days to go, CBS was second to NBC in
sweeps competition.
   NBC's average since the beginning of the season stands at 15.8.
ABC has 13.5 and CBS 13.2.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use.
   The top 10-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
``A Different World'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``The Incredible Hulk
Returns'' NBC, ``Night Court'' NBC, ``Bob Hope's Birthday'' NBC,
``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Unsolved Mysteries''
NBC,'' and ``The American Comedy Awards'' ABC.
   The lowest-rated, prime-time shows were: ``Eisenhower & Lutz''
tied with ``Full House,'' ``Perfect Strangers,'' ``Garfield's 10th
Anniversary,'' ``Beryl Markham, Part 2,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Meet
the Munceys,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``M&W Magazine,''
``Probe'' and ``Our House.''
   NBC remained third in the news race but closed the gap somewhat.
For the week that ended Friday, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was
first for the fourth week in a row, finishing with an average
rating of 9.5 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 9.2
and a 19 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.8 and 19 share.

   U.S. Attorney Edward S.G. Dennis Jr.,
President Reagan's choice to head the cirminal division of the
Justice Department, is known for painstaking investigations that
have led to his winning convictions in racketeering and official
corruption cases.
   If Dennis, 43, is confirmed by the Senate as assistant attorney
general, the stint in Washington will be his second.
   He was an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia before
becoming head of the narcotics section at the Justice Department's
criminal division in 1980. Reagan appointed him U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia on May 4, 1983, the first black to hold the post in
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
   His office obtained convictions of more than 30 Philadelphia
police officers, including the deputy police commissioner, on
extortion and racketeering charges.
   Dennis also handled the successful prosecution of Nicodemo
Scarfo, the reputed head of organized crime in the Philadelphia
area, and City Councilman Leland Beloff for trying to extort $1
million from a developer to obtain City Council approval to build a
waterfront development.
   In five years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia,
Dennis lost only one case. He attributed his record to his
methodical style of preparation _ going over evidence again and
again, examining and re-examining witnesses until he was able to
``anticipate every conceivable attack.''

   Harold G. Christensen, nominated for the
post of deputy attorney general, is a civil trial lawyer known for
his ability to organize, plan and manage details, colleagues say.
   If confirmed by the Senate, the 61-year-old Christensen would
assume the No. 2 spot in the Justice Department.
   One colleague suggested that Christensen's qualifications exceed
those of Attorney General Edwin Meese.
   ``I would go so far as to say that as far as being the chief
legal enforcement officer in this country, Hal is eminently more
qualified than Mr. Meese,'' said attorney Robert Campbell.
   Christensen, a senior partner and chairman of the board of the
law firm Snow, Christensen & Martineau, was born in Springville,
Utah, graduated from the University of Utah and received a law
degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1951.
   ``His ability to reason is unusual,'' said attorney Eugene C.
Hansen. ``He has a superior ability to organize, execute plans,
manage and delegate.''
   Although a Republican, Christensen once organized a Lawyers for
Scott Matheson group to campaign for the former Democratic governor.
   He was president of the Salt Lake County Bar Association in
1972, was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers in
1974 and was Utah State Bar president in 1975-76.
   Christensen was named the state bar's Lawyer of the Year in 1984
and was appointed chairman of the U.S. Judicial Selection
Commission that year.

   An ancient road traveled by the likes
of Genghis Khan, Marco Polo and Babur has become an active artery
of commerce today between China and Pakistan.
   More than 2,000 years ago, silk and spices made their way out of
China on the route, while gold, silver and wool made their way in.
   The commerce today is considerably more diverse, if not as
exotic.
   As many as 80 Pakistani merchants travel the road into China
each day in battered buses to buy silk, porcelain and pearls, and
Chinese businessmen head in the opposite direction toward the
Khunjerab Pass on the border as part of a barter arrangement
between the two countries.
   The barter enables the Chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment,
farm tools, textiles, quilts and porcelain for Pakistani
cigarettes, medical herbs, dried fruits, shoes and razor blades.
   The volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of
$3 million in the past year, compared to $300,000 in 1986,
according to Sadeq Malek, sales officer of Pakistan's Northern
Areas Traders Cooperatives.
   The road also is being traveled more and more by tourists.
   From Pakistan's border post of Sost the road follows the Hunza
River, then runs along the icy Khunjerab River into China, crossing
numerous glaciers. As it climbs to the Khunjerab Pass, it goes
through a series of narrow chasms and steep declines.
   At Tashkargan, the first Chinese town across the border, workmen
are building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number of
travelers passing through.
   Kamel Tahsin, manager of the government-run Pamir Hotel in
Tashkargan, said the new hotels will be more modern and better
equipped.
   ``Business is getting better,'' he said. ``So we have to add a
couple of wings to our hotel.''
   Tahsin is one of about 12,000 people in Tashkargan who are
Shiite Moslem Tajiks, the tribe dominant in the area. They are
distinguishable by their sharp features and their women by their
colorful costume.
   Across the border in Sost, Pakistanis also are building to meet
the growing flow of tourists.
   Assif Khan, a Pakistani government tourist official, said big
tour groups now travel to China four times a month compared to
twice a month a year ago.
   But it's a tough road to travel, says Amanollah Mogul, the bus
driver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth to
China.
   The Khunjerab Pass, he said, makes him dizzy.

   Horticulturists from China, garden club members
from Biggleswade and window-box farmers from the inner city
clutched their coveted tickets Tuesday for the Chelsea Flower Show,
which has sprouted along the River Thames this week like a promise
of summer.
   On the sun-dappled lawns beside the red-brick Royal Hospital are
displayed the very best roses, dahlias, pansies and delphiniums
that this nation of gardeners can produce.
   So great are the crowds at Britain's most prestigious annual
garden extravaganza that the Royal Horticultural Society limited
ticket sales for the four-day trade show to 45,000 per day _ at $26
each _ and may have to move to a larger site next year.
   Last year, 243,000 people crowded onto the 19-acre site, most of
them milling under the 3{-acre marquee that covers the choicest
displays.
   Members of the 84-year-old society, which has sponsored the
Chelsea show since 1913, have their own viewing days, as does Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Membership in the society is 110,000 and growing, said assistant
secretary Stephen Bennett. Most are Britons, but there are many
American members and a Japanese branch has just begun.
   More leisure time and income have boosted the growth of
gardening, Bennett said.
   ``But the most important thing is there are no social
barriers,'' he said. ``At the show, you'll see dowagers and dustmen
(garbage collectors) talking about the same thing.''
   Gardening in Britain is the closest thing to a universal
interest, not counting curiosity about the royal family.
   Five weekly TV and radio programs are devoted to gardening, and
the British Broadcasting Corp.'s 13-part series, ``The Victorian
Kitchen Garden,'' was such a hit last year that it's already being
repeated.
   It is difficult to imagine another country where a half hour of
prime time television would be devoted to the growing of tomatoes
or methods of repelling slugs; where a person alarmed by clematis
wilt can telephone an expert on TV and get immediate help; or where
three wry horticulturists could become national celebrities through
their radio question-and-answer show.
   Some city-dwellers nurturing pots of herbs on the windowsill or
geraniums on the roof terrace dream of the gardening opportunities
in the countryside. But even in London, most people have access to
a bit of grass and soil and just about all of them plant something
in it.
   Because most of central London's dwellings are rowhouses, there
are thousands of narrow back gardens, neatly fenced and stretching
to meet an identical row of gardens from the houses on the next
street.
   The English rose, honeysuckle, ivy, jasmine and purple wisteria
climb the fences and camouflage the garden sheds. Lilacs, plum
trees, lavender and foxgloves fill the borders _ often leaving just
enough grass to warrant a push mower.
   Even in the teeming center of the city, there often is a garden
in the back and a cat lying in the sun. No upstanding neighborhood
pub is without its windowbox of ivy and geraniums.
   The 18 garden club members on a Chevron North Sea oil platform
never have to worry about slugs and aphids, although space is
limited in their 10 foot by 8 foot greenhouse bolted to the deck,
100 miles off the Shetland Islands, northeast of Scotland.
   ``You get a great feeling of satisfaction when you sit down to a
fresh tomato sprinkled with chopped basil, knowing you've grown
them both,'' rig electrician Malcolm Dobinson told The Daily Mail.
   Thousands of Londoners work allotments, patches of public land
rented for a few pounds a year to families who want to grow their
own food.
   ``We got 60 pounds of strawberries off the allotment last
year,'' said Ena Mundy, who's been attending the Chelsea show for
30 years.
   She and her husband travel 18 miles twice a week to their
allotment because the soil is ``lovely rich and loamy. Now we're
retired, it's our main interest,'' she said.
   Outer London's Barnet borough has 250 acres in allotments, each
10 yards by 30 yards.
   Most of these amateur gardeners would probably agree with writer
Alan Titchmarsh who told an interviewer: ``There's really nowhere
else in the world I'd rather be than in my garden. When my time
comes I'd be happy to peg out there. An epitaph? Gone to Make
Manure.''

   More than 17 years after Wilda Richardson
mailed a Christmas card to an acquaintance, the post office
returned it, unopened.
   But Mrs. Richardson wasn't upset.
   ``I'm sure that whatever happened was an accident,'' she said.
``I'm sure the post office tries their best not to let this kind of
thing happen.''
   The card, mailed Dec. 22, 1970, showed up mysteriously last week
marked ``return to sender.'' It was intended for Mildred Mealor, a
fellow member of the Pilot Club International, who has since died.
   In 1970, Mrs. Richardson was executive director of the service
club for business and professional women. Each year, she mailed
hundreds of homemade Christmas cards to friends and club chapters
across the country.
   The card came back with a May 18 postmark from Gainesville and a
May 19 postmark from Macon. It was not delivered postage due, even
though it bore a 6-cent stamp.
   Mrs. Richardson, 84, said she has mailed so many Christmas cards
that she had no idea this one never reached its destination.
   No one knows where the card spent the last 17{ years.
Gainesville Postmaster Larry Latimer was baffled.
   ``If it was found in my post office, I'm sure I would have heard
about it. Given the size of our office, it's hard to imagine it
lying around for 18 years,'' Latimer said.

   Call him persistent, call him tenacious,
or call him what co-workers at a computer company dubbed him after
a three-year struggle to rid the plant grounds of geese: ``Mr.
Goosebuster.''
   Norm Heifetz, 52, facilities manager of the Bytex Corp., has
become a minor celebrity. Employees presented him with a ``Mr.
Goosebuster'' plaque and goosebuster emblems can be spotted
throughout the company, Heifetz said. Heifetz' picture even
appeared on the front page of a local newspaper.
   His fame came after he waged war with the pesky geese, which
filled the man-made pond at the plant and, even worse, ``strolled
all over the grounds.''
   ``They come and proliferate and have babies and they make a holy
mess of the property,'' he said. ``They like young, fresh grass so
they go grazing all day long. It wouldn't have been so bad if they
stayed out back but they came strolling on the sidewalk near the
front entrance.''
   At first, he banged pots and pans to frighten the geese away.
Then, while researching the problem, he learned that geese are
``deathly afraid of swans'' and bought ``a bunch of fake ones.''
   Nothing worked.
   Last year, when the geese returned in late spring, Heifetz began
a new plan of attack. He wired up huge speakers and blared distress
calls over the pond. Still, the geese remained.
   Then Heifetz tried a small, remote-controlled boat. Success at
last.
   ``It made a terrible noise and chased them out,'' he said.

   A man's toothless technique earned him a
clam-eating contest victory and possible world record as he downed
397 of the mollusks in eight minutes.
   Dave Barnes of Sequim, a roofer who has been eating the bivalves
in competition for 16 years, already holds the record listed in the
``Guinness Book of World Records'' of 424 clams in eight minutes.
   That record, set in 1975 at Port Townsend, included a one-minute

by Ivar's Acres of Clams restaurant on Seattle's waterfront, was
non-stop. Contest spokesman Barry Bartlett said Barnes' performance
also will be submitted to the record book.
   Barnes said he had an advantage over competitors: He took out
his false teeth and let the clams slide down unobstructed.
   In second place was Glen Jones of Kent, who ate 306 clams.
   The 12 contestants downed a total of 2,615 steamed clams.

   The English-language China Daily said the State Education

   The limits range from 30 minutes a day for second- and
third-grade students to an hour daily for sixth-grade pupils, the

had been.
   The panel also said pupils ``should not be given the kind of
homework that requires heavy monotonous routine work, such as large
amounts of copying drills.'' Rote drilling has been the basic
method of education in China for centuries.
   High schools will be allowed to hold major exams only in key
subjects and only at the middle and end of terms, the commission
said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Criticizes Trade Bill Veto; Bush Aides Reassure House GOP
Leaders</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS grafs 7-8 pvs with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Idaho results</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis said Tuesday it was ``a
very serious mistake'' for President Reagan to veto trade
legislation that requires advance notice of plant closing. George
Bush's aides sought to reassure House Republicans about the vice
president's poor standing in recent polls.
   ``We have bad polls,'' Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois said after
attending a closed-door session with Bush's top advisers. ``If this
were October we'd be suicidal. But it's May.''
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' sole remaining Democratic rival,
campaigned in California in advance of the state's June 7 primary.
He said he would seek government assistance for a farm town where a
dozen children have been diagnosed with cancer in recent years.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis spent most of the day in Boston,
where he issued a statement blasting Reagan and Bush on the trade
bill and linking the veto to negotiations with Panama's Manuel
Noriega, who faces indictment on drug charges.
   ``Any administration that is willing to give Gen. Noriega 120
days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the
American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the
street,'' he said in a statement.
   Bush declared his independence from Reagan on the Noriega talks
last week, saying he opposed negotiations designed to force the
Panamanian leader to give up his power in exchange for having the
drug indictments dropped.
   The vice president had no official appearances during the day,
although he added Idaho to his list of primary state victories.
With a quarter of the precincts reporting, Bush had 81 percent to
10 percent for Pat Robertson, who suspended his Republican
candidacy earlier this month.
   Bush was winning 15 delegates in Idaho, to two for Robertson,
and one uncommitted. The vice president wrapped up a majority of
Republican National Convention delegates a month ago.
   The Democratic primary in Idaho was a non-binding preference
poll and no delegates were at stake. Dukakis won easily, with 77
percent to Jackson's 14 percent, with 24 percent of the precincts
reporting.
   The next _ and last _ Democratic primary elections will be June
7, with contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana.
   Although neither Bush nor Dukakis was out campaigning during the
day, each took steps to rally the troops around their certain
candidacies.
   The vice president's campaign officials announced that Sen.
Charles Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad would play important roles
in the fall campaign in Iowa. Grassley was a staunch supporter of
Sen. Bob Dole in the state's heated caucus campaign _ which Bush
lost in a third place finish _ while Branstad was neutral.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis arranged a visit to Washington
on Wednesday en route to campaigning in California. His aides said
he would meet with several groups of House members and senators,
and expected to pick up endorsements from roughly a dozen lawmakers
as he closes in on a nominating majority of Democratic National
Convention delegates.
   Three top Bush advisers met with House Republicans, and one of
them, pollster Robert Teeter, said polls indicate the vice
president is running behind but the race is in a ``very artificial
period.'' He said he told the lawmakers that, ``What you got to do
is get past this California primary before people begin to focus on
it (the presidential race).''
   Several lawmakers said Bush's decision to disagree with Reagan's
policy of negotiations with Noriega drew praise.
   ``It's a very symbolic circumstance, where Bush has moved from
being vice president to being his own candidate,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach of Iowa.
   Ms. Martin added, ``Almost to a person, they were pleased about
the separation on Noriega.;''
   But she also said there was concern about recent polls
indicating Dukakis leads the vice president. ``There wasn't anybody
up screaming, `My God, we've got the Titanic,''' she said.
   Dukakis' linkage of the trade bill veto with the Noriega
negotiations marked an attempt to hit Bush on two issues that
Democratic strategists believe damage the vice president.
   ``To veto this bill because it will give working people and
their families 60 days notice before they're laid off, seems to me
to be unconscionable,'' he said.
   He said Reagan and Bush ``don't understand that for working
families who struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their
children's education and care for their elders, there is nothing
more painful than losing a job.''
   ``I think the president is making a very serious mistake. This
is a good trade bill. It's a responsible bill,'' he said.

   It isn't easy to hold an audience's attention
with a full-length ballet which has no plot, and few choreographers
try. Graeme Murphy has tried and succeeded with ``Shining.''
   The Sydney Dance Company from Australia danced the two-hour
``Shining'' Tuesday night as the opening program of a two-week
season at the City Center. Murphy choreographed it in 1986 to mark
10 years as the company's artistic director.
   The first section, titled ``Dawn,'' had duets, trios, quartets
and groups of 14. While the enormously vital and versatile dancers
were on stage, Murphy allowed them no rest. They were swinging
around, jumping, lifting or being lifted, swooping down for floor
work, being dragged or dragging somebody along the floor.
   The music by Karol Szymanowski sounded like dramatic movie
music, with something important about to happen every minute. When
the tempo was especially fast, it was usually Nina Veretennikova
who danced.
   Alfred Williams had a mesmerizing solo in the first section. He
and Andrea Toy danced the second section, ``Pre-Dawn,'' which
Murphy created in 1985 as a duet named ``Shimmering.''
   The final section, ``Night,'' has duets, quartets and groups
again and is almost entirely danced in couples.
   ``Shining'' was never predictable.
   The company gave the U.S. premiere of ``Shining'' May 16 at
Stanford, Calif. After June 8 and 9 performances in San Antonio,
Texas, the company will perform for two months in Europe. ``After
Venice,'' which will be danced this season, had its American
premiere when the company was last in New York, in 1985.

   Nicaragua's Contra rebels will offer to lay
down their arms on Sept. 1 as part of a comprehensive peace accord
to be presented to the Nicaraguan government Wednesday, a
congressional aide said Tuesday.
   Members of the rebels' political directorate, in meetings on
Capitol Hill and at the State Department, also said they would not
be the first to break a two-month cease-fire after it expires May
30, even if no new truce agreement is in effect.
   And they said they would accept a proposal for delivery of
humanitarian aid to their forces inside Nicaragua by an agency with
ties to the Organization of American States.
   But they made it clear that did not mean they were accepting the
Sandinista government's unilateral announcement, made a day
earlier, that it simply would extend the current truce for another
month.
   Rather, the Contra proposal will include ``all the necessary
things for a permanent end to the war in Nicaragua,'' said Alfredo
Cesar, a member of the directorate and the leader of the
negotiating delegation.
   An aide to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who was briefed on
the Contra proposal, said Wright hoped the move was sincere and
constructive. The aide, Wilson Morris, said the setting of a date
for the rebels to lay down their arms, in particular, ``appears to
be progress.''
   In an interview Tuesday night, Wright said, ``Tomorrow I hope
and believe that a major effort will be made to open up the peace
plan and to reach a settlement between the two sides in
Nicaragua....''
   ``Broad suggestions (are) going to be made by the resistance,
the Contras, that they will accept a certain time to lay down their
arms and reintegrate into the society if the government will make
certain guarantees of free elections at certain specific dates and
guarantee of private properties and the restoration of those civil
liberties,'' Wright said on Cable News Network's ``Larry King
Live'' program.
   Cesar said the proposal will go beyond the cease-fire agreement
reached two months ago in Sapoa, Nicaragua, and include a timetable
for specific political changes called for in last year's regional
peace agreement.
   Those changes include a free and fair electoral system, an
independent judiciary with the power to guarantee human rights,
removal of the military from Sandinista party control and
guaranteed property rights, he said.
   Cesar also said the rebels were prepared to accept a proposal to
have $17.7 million in U.S. humanitarian aid delivered through the
Pan American Development Foundation, which would subcontract with
commercial carriers to distribute supplies to troops inside
cease-fire zones in Nicaragua.
   The foundation is tied to the Organization of American States,
whose secretary general, Joao Baena Soares, is on a commission to
verify compliance with the cease-fire agreement.
   Cesar said the Sandinistas have failed to comply with
commitments made in Sapoa, and that a simple extension of the
current truce would not address those failures.
   ``An extension of the truce period means an extension for the
Sandinistas to keep violating Sapoa, to keep imprisoning union
leaders ... to keep interfering with freedom of the press,'' said
Adolfo Calero, another directorate member.
   Meanwhile, American and Honduran officials say Nicaragua appears
to be building up stocks of weapons and making other preparations
for an attack on the Contras if the peace talks fail, according to
a published report.
   The officials cite aerial reconnaissance photographs and other
evidence they say suggest a military buildup, The New York Times
reported in its Wednesday editions.
   U.S. officials said the photographs showed that airfields at
Wapsam near the Honduran border and at La Tranquera in southern
Nicaragua have been upgraded; that new military storage depots are
being built near Sebaco, about 50 miles north of Managua, and that
military supplies are being stockpiled at El Tempisque just outside
Managua.
   President Reagan, meanwhile, accused the Sandinistas of
foot-dragging, saying the United States was looking for ``deeds,
not more words.''
   ``If the current stalemate in the peace process persists and the
Sandinistas continue their policies of repression, then we will
call upon the Congress to reconsider its Feb. 3 decision to curtail
assistance to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters,'' Reagan said in a
statement issued by the White House.
   The president said that despite the 60-day truce, ``the
Sandinistas have continued, and indeed intensified their repression
of the Nicaragua people.''
   Since the Sapoa accord was reached, the Contra ranks have been
torn by internal bickering and power struggles. Cesar acknowledged
that the rebels now are weaker militarily than they were in March,
``but not politically.''
   He said the rebels' primary leverage in the new round of talks
will be the threat that if the Sandinistas appear intransigent,
Congress could be moved to grant new military aid to the Contras
and renew the war.
   Cesar noted that the Sandinista attitude softened following a
May 12 letter from 24 members of Congress who warned that military
aid could be resumed if the leftist government did not facilitate
delivery of aid to rebel troops inside the country.
   All five members of the directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance
_ Cesar, Calero, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, Maria Azucena Ferrey and
Aristides Sanchez _ will go to the talks.

   Iranian security forces smashed several
gangs smuggling arms and narcotics, Iran said.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday that
30 ``armed highway bandits'' were arrested in Tehran, Tabriz and
Khorramabad for smuggling drugs and selling weapons to
``counterrevolutionaries.''
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said 12 members of an
underground group were arrested in Tehran, Tabriz and other cities
for selling arms to dissident groups and procuring forged passports
and visas for Iranians, including draft dodgers, seeking to flee
the country.
   Thirty members of a group of ``well-educated professionals''
were rounded up in Tehran, Tabriz and other towns for coating
metals with a thin layer of gold and selling them as pure gold, the
agency said.
   In East Azarbaijan Province, customs men seized 146 precious
silk carpets that were to be smuggled abroad, the agency added. The
security operations were carried out over the last few days, IRNA
reported.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II joined 2,500 people in a
service at St. Paul's Cathedral celebrating the 250th anniversary
of the religious movement that grew into the Methodist Church.
   The interdenominational service on Tuesday, which was attended
by represenatives of 50 nations, commemorated John Wesley's
conversion at a Christian meeting in London on May 24, 1738.
   The fiery preacher traveled by horseback through the English
countryside spreading the gospel with his hymn-writing brother,
Charles.
   Their followers separated from the state Church of England and
established Methodism after John Wesley's death in 1791.
   Queen Elizabeth is the titular head of the Church of England,
and her presence at the service was seen as a gesture acknowledging
the contribution of the Methodist Church to British life.
   She was accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has survived a Republican
attempt to scale back his pay to reflect the days he spends in his
Statehouse office and not on the presidential campaign trail.
   Late Tuesday, after nearly 10 hours of debate over next year's
state budget, Republican Rep. Kevin Poirier offered an amendment to
the $1,888,828 intended to pay the governor and his staff.
   Under the language offered by Poirier, Dukakis would get paid
only for days he is in the state.
   Since the start of this year, Poirier noted, the governor has
spent 68 days out of state, 18 days in state and 51 days in which
he spent part of the day here and part elsewhere.
   ``So therefore, for the 68 days he was out of the state, based
on his salary of $85,000, he owes us $15,835,'' the assistant
minority leader said.
   ``With this amendment, what I'm trying to do is bring some
fiscal sanity back into the commonwealth. We do have a fiscal
crisis. Let's try to address it in his office,'' he said.
   No Democrat rose to defend the governor, but the amendment was
defeated on a voice vote.

<HEAD>Dukakis Calls For Tougher State Laws On Child Porn, DUI And
Sentencing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has asked Massachusetts
lawmakers to approve a crime package designed to tighten state laws
on child pornography, drunken driving and criminal sentencing.
   ``Over the past five years, we have done a lot to fight crime
and make our citizens safer here in Massachusetts,'' the Democratic
presidential hopeful said Tuesday in testimony to the Legislature's
joint Criminal Justice Committee.
   ``That's because we've worked together on a get-tough,
no-nonsense approach to crime that's based on results, not
rhetoric.''
   But Dukakis said recent drug-related violence in Boston was ``a
grim reminder'' of the expanding agenda of crime issues.
   ``When we find loopholes in our laws that allow criminals to
avoid punishment, or when we find programs that could be
strengthened to protect innocent children, then we need to work
together and take action,'' he said.
   He appealed for swift action on:
   _The latest version of his ``presumptive sentencing'' bill,
which Dukakis has offered annually in his second and third terms.
The legislation would establish sentencing guidelines for crimes
and allow prosecutors to appeal sentences they consider too low.
   _A bill to restore the state law against child pornography,
which was struck down earlier this year by the state Supreme Court
on the grounds that it was unconstitutionally broad.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the state
court's action, but Dukakis argued that the state needs a law on
the books immediately, in order to prevent ``the devastating and
lifelong psychological and physical damage'' caused by sexual
exploitation.
   _Legislation to increase penalties against drivers who leave the
scene of an accident. The governor's brother was killed by a
hit-and-run driver.
   Dukakis' legislative package also would allow Massachusetts
police to cross state lines ``in hot pursuit'' of drunken drivers
and increase the penalties for refusing to submit to a breath test.
   For the first time, Dukakis also supported a measure allowing
judges to revoke the driving license of anyone convicted of a drug
offense.
   In his testimony, Dukakis credited the Legislature and his own
administration for making Massachusetts safer. He said overall
crime is down more than 13 percent in the last four years, the
second-largest such decline of any state.

   Q: Where are you if you see a bowl of M&Ms and
find that someone has removed all the brown ones?
   A: Chances are, you're backstage at a concert by Van Halen;
members of the rock band specifically demand that all brown M&Ms be
deleted.
   That's according to Leonard ``Cy'' Kocis, 41, the Mahwah,
N.J.-based caterer who services rockers and other entertainers on
the road. Sometimes, he said recently, his clients make peculiar
demands.
   For example:
   The rock group Rush wants Coca-Cola, but only in the
old-fashioned glass bottles. U2 wants shepherd's pie and Dom
Perignon champagne. Tiffany has a hankering for Evian water and ``a
variety of kosher meats.'' Bon Jovi requires Jolt cola, the
caffeine-laden drink. Frank Sinatra, by contrast, wanted only
Campbell's chicken and rice soup _ in a can.

   Two musicians who knew Michael Jackson during
his boyhood in Gary, Ind., claim in a $400 million federal lawsuit
that Jackson and Lionel Richie pirated such songs as ``Thriller''
and ``We Are The World.''
   Reynaud Jones and Robert Smith, both of Gary, and a third man,
Clifford Rubin of Chicago, are seeking the money from the two
singer-songwriters, producer Quincy Jones, and others.
   ``We deny the allegations vehemently in both suits. Both are
frivolous,'' Jackson's attorney, Robert Rotstein, said Tuesday.
   ``There are numerous such suits (against pop stars),'' said
Rotstein, who specializes in copyright cases. ``This happens all
the time. ... People are trying to trade in on the success of a
talented person.''
   Jones, Smith and Rubin claim their music can be heard on
Jackson's hit ``Thriller''' and ``We Are the World,'' the
Jackson-Richie anthem that raised money for starvation victims in
Africa.
   The defendants also say ``The Girl Is Mine'' and ``Another Part
of Me,'' from Jackson's latest album ``Bad,'' contain lyrics from
songs they wrote. The lawsuit was filed in November.
   Jones and Smith claim they grew up with the Jackson family in
Gary, and Jones claims to have helped the brothers launch their
career as the ``Jackson 5.''
   Rotstein said Michael Jackson may have known Jones and Smith
during his boyhood, but ``I don't think they had a close
relationship with Michael Jackson. They may have known a couple of
the other brothers,'' Rotstein said.
   The lawsuit is the second one pending against Jackson in Los
Angeles federal court that claims the pop superstar pirated ``We
Are The World.''

   Prince Charles helped dedicate a new
gallery of modern art that will give a boost to this ailing
industrial city once best known as the birthplace of the Beatles.
   Charles on Tuesday reopened a renovated complex of Victorian
warehouses in a development he hailed as of ``immense importance.''
One of the the buildings contains an extension of London's Tate
Gallery.
   ``This project will help enormously to restore the confidence of
people in areas which once knew great success and prosperity and
which will, I know, in due course return to that prosperity,'' the
prince said.
   The Tate Gallery is the national museum of British art and
international modern art. In Liverpool, it will show paintings and
sculpture that it doesn't always have space for in London.
   ``As Liverpool was already rich in museums and galleries, the
Tate extension makes it the second art city in England after
London,'' said the museum's curator, Richard Francis.

   Senate backers of a major trade bill are
expecting an uphill battle to find enough votes to override
President Reagan's veto, in striking contrast to the quick and
overwhelming House vote to reverse the president's action.
   ``We have to have another three votes at this point and I don't
know where they are going to come from,'' said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a chief sponsor of the
1,000-page trade measure.
   The Senate is expected to take up the legislation after it
returns from the Memorial Day recess.
   Reagan's veto of the legislation on Tuesday came as no surprise.
He has been critical in numerous speeches of a provision that would
require companies to give employees 60 days notice of plant
closings and large-scale layoffs. He has said that businesses need
flexibility to survive hard times.
   In his veto message to Congress, Reagan repeated that argument.
   ``I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes
necessary. ... It is the humane thing to do.
   ``But I object to the idea that the federal government would
arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all
circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification
should take place.''
   The president urged lawmakers to submit a revised version trade
bill that he could sign in good conscience.
   Within hours of Reagan's veto, the House voted, 308-113, to
override it. That was far more than needed to be successful.
   Sixty Republicans broke with Reagan to vote for the override,
while only one Democrat, Robert J. Mrazek of New York, supported
the president.
   The plant-closings measure is among scores of provisions
contained in the bill. The main ones would overhaul the U.S. system
of import restrictions. Others range from repealing the windfall
profits tax to adding billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies.
   Democratic leaders have argued that patching together a stripped
down trade bill might be tough before Congress leaves town for the
campaign trail.
   Uncertain of override prospects in the Senate, many Democrats
focused on making the debate a campaign issue.
   ``I happen to think it's a better issue for Democrats than for
Republicans,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said.
   Michael Dukakis, the front-runner in the battle for the
Democratic presidential nomination, called the president's action
``unconscionable.''
   He said that Reagan and Vice President George Bush ``don't
understand that for working families who struggle to pay the
mortgage, save for their children's education and care for their
elders, there is nothing more painful than losing a job.''
   He contrasted the veto to a tentative deal under which drug
charges against Antonio Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader,
would be dropped if he agreed to relinquish power and leave Panama
by August.
   ``Any administration that is willing to give General Noriega 120
days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the
American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the
street,'' Dukakis said.
   Reagan said that he vetoed the measure ``with sincere regret,''
but said in his message that returning the measure to Congress was
necessary.
   ``I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our
economic growth,'' the president said.
   He said that the American economy has created 16 million jobs
during his administration and that the unemployment rate is at its
lowest point in 14 years.
   He also said that the measure would ``push us in the direction
of protectionism. Closing our borders is not the solution to
opening foreign markets,'' Reagan said.
   Administration supporters rallied to Reagan's support following
the veto.
   Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., scoffed at the image of
``unfeeling and mean-spirited owners of large and small American
businesses putting upon weak and defenseless workers who are about
to be thrown out on the street ... unless big government puts its
firm and fatherly hand'' on the situation.
   ``As usual, this House believes that big government knows more
than we in private life,'' Frenzel said. ``This debate paints a
depressing view of America and it is inaccurate.''
   But the veto also unleashed a torrent of criticism on the House
floor.
   ``The Japanese are laughing now that you have vetoed this trade
bill,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   ``For seven years, the Reagan administration has just said no to
American workers,'' Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., issued a statement saying that
``the country understands the importance of notice about plant
closings and layoffs, even if the White House does not.''
   ``Voluntary notice is a fig leaf over the problem,'' Kennedy
said.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, however, recalled in a statement
that restrictions on exports of oil from his state remain in the
legislation.
   ``I voted against the trade bill when it passed the Senate and
intend to vote to sustain the president's veto,'' Murkowski said.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Lawyers Fight Efforts to Use Congressional Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers are accusing independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh of trying to punish former White House
aide Oliver L. North and two co-defendants for trying to tell
Congress the ``whole truth'' about the Iran-Contra affair.
   The defense contends that Walsh was ``completely wrong on the
law'' by claiming that hundreds of statements that North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert
Hakim made to Congress could be used against them as evidence of
criminal wrongdoing.
   By claiming the defendants waived their limited immunity grants
from Congress, Walsh ``seeks to punish defendants for responding
fully and in good faith to congressional inquiries, when compelled
to do so over vehement objection, and for relaying to Congress and
the nation what occurred and why,'' the defense said in a brief
filed Tuesday.
   Although North, Poindexter and Hakim testified under immunity
grants that prohibit use of their statements as evidence against
them, Walsh contends that the defendants waived the privilege
against self-incrimination by volunteering answers that were not
responsive to questions posed by the Iran-Contra committees.
   Walsh has said that he would not use any of this congressional
testimony during the trial if the court denies a defense request to
conduct an extensive hearing to determine if his investigation was
tainted by impermissible use of the defendants' immunized
statements.
   The defense called Walsh's offer an attempt ``to threaten the
court with a lengthy inquiry into immunized testimony, and then to
use that threat as leverage to strike a favorable bargain with the
court.''
   ``This tactic is unseemly,'' the defense lawyers said in a joint
pleading.
   North, the fired National Security Council aide, Poindexter and
Hakim are accused of conspiring with retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord to defraud the government by diverting Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Secord, also an arms
dealer, testified without an immunity grant from Congress.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim contend that their Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination would be violated if they were
forced to stand trial on criminal charges following their compelled
congressional testimony. They claim that Walsh's prosecution was
tainted by illegal use of their sworn statements to Congress.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is scheduled to hear
arguments on the issue on Thursday.
   In its latest filing, the defense said ``there is no claim that
defendants uttered a single word, during the course of their
congressional testimony, that was outside the subject matter of the
congressional inquiry.''
   North, Poindexter and Hakim were not waiving any rights when
they ``explained their answers; or sought to provide useful,
related information to be sure their answers were complete and
accurate _ in short, the `whole truth' they had sworn to provide.''
   The defense said Walsh's position would force Gesell to examine
each and every one of the hundreds of statements to verify Walsh's
claim they were exempt from immunity.
   Walsh contended that the unprotected statements include
Poindexter's admission that he approved the diversion of arms-sale
profits to the Contras but did not tell President Reagan to ensure
that the president could deny involvement if the operation were
exposed.
   The unprotected statements also include Poindexter's remarks
that during Attorney General Edwin Meese III's November 1986
investigation, Poindexter destroyed a presidential intelligence
finding authorizing CIA involvement in one 1985 arms shipment,
Walsh contended.
   Walsh also claimed that North's statements that he destroyed
documents in October and November 1986 could be used as evidence to
prove charges that the fired National Security Council aide
obstructed Meese's inquiry.
   In a separate filing on Tuesday, Walsh's office said that ``it
is clear beyond doubt'' that North, Poindexter and Hakim waged a
``public relations battle'' during their congressional testimony.
   ``In utter defiance of the questions put to them, they sought to
win with speeches and arguments,'' the prosecution brief said.

   A propane tanker truck overturned, burst
into flames and burned intensely through the day Tuesday, forcing
police to close two highways, shut a section of the Long Island
Rail Road and evacuate 2,000 homes.
   There were no serious injuries, officials said. The driver and a
trainee who was riding with him escaped before the explosion. The
driver was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut.
   The fire was so intense and potentially explosive that
firefighters had to move back from the fire early in the afternoon,
leaving automatic pumpers to throw water on the blaze.
   Nearly 1,000 homes within half a mile of the burning truck were
evacuated, with residents taken to a church, Nassau County police
spokeswoman Officer Donna Fairweather said. Hank McCann, a
department public information officer, said more homes were
evacuated at 10:30 p.m. bringing the total to about 2,000.
``(Police) cars went through the area with loudspeakers urging
people to evacuate,'' he said.
   Two unmanned automatic fire trucks were pumping water onto the
fire late Tuesday night, hours after the 9:30 a.m. accident.
Authorities said the tanker, carrying about 2,500 gallons of
propane, could burn for as long as 30 hours.
   Sections of the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway, where the
accident occurred, and the Sunrise Highway, near the expressway,
were closed, Fairweather said.
   The Long Island Rail Road twice suspended service on its busiest
branch, between Wantagh and Amityville, said railroad spokesman
Brian Dolan. He estimated that 70,000 train commuters were affected.
   County police Lt. Willard Krausch said the truck overturned on
the southbound lane of the expressway when the driver experienced a
problem with the truck's rear wheels.
   The driver, identified by police as Roger Vai, 35, of Westbury,
was arrested at the scene on an outstanding traffic warrant and was
also charged with driving with a suspended license and failure to
produce a license. He was taken later released on $100 bail.
   Krausch said the truck was owned by Conservative Gas of Hyde
Park.

<TEXT>
   Hours after George Bush campaign aides tried
to explain to House Republicans when things would start going right
for the vice president, President Reagan vetoed a trade bill the
Democrats were itching to make an issue in the fall presidential
campaign.
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be,
fired off this response Tuesday when the president's veto message
reached Congress:
   ``Any administration that is willing to give General (Manuel)
Noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to
give the American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out
on the street.''
   The Massachusetts governor was referring to the provision that
would require companies to give workers and communities notice
before closing plants.
   Reagan said he thought giving such notice was ``the humane thing
to do'' but he objected to making it mandatory.
   ``I don't really see it as a campaign issue,'' said Rep. Guy
Molinari. ``I could be wrong.''
   The chairman of the Bush campaign in New York, Molinari was one
of 60 Republicans who deserted the president and voted to override
the veto.
   The House voted 308-113 to override the veto, but Senate
Democratic leaders have predicted the president will prevail in
that chamber.
   The Democrats certainly are betting it will be an issue in the
fall campaign.
   ``I happen to think it's a better issue for the Democrats than
for the Republicans,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., asked, ``Why hand it to us on a silver platter?''
   Like the president, Bush appeared to be walking a narrow line on
the trade bill.
   During a recent campaign appearance, he even had kind words for
the Massachusetts plant closing law that Dukakis often cites.
   ``In Massachusetts, they have a plant closing law, it's
voluntary. It's not like the federal government imposing it,'' said
the vice president.
   Massachusetts law offers financial and management assistance to
companies and those that accept are then required to give 90 days
notice of plant closings.
   The trade bill veto came on the same day that Bush campaign
aides were getting encouragement from House Republicans for his
recent moves away from Reagan, specifically on the Noriega
negotiations.
   Disagreeing with the idea of dropping drug charges against the
military leader and de facto ruler of Panama is not a politically
high-risk move.
   Likewise, one must expect that if Attorney General Edwin Meese
III continues to cling to his job, Bush will begin to hint that he
thinks it's time for Meese to step aside.
   Bush doesn't need high-priced pollsters to tell him Noriega and
Meese aren't bringing him a lot of votes.
   But a far more critical question is how many general election
votes Ronald Reagan brings his vice president.
   Bush supporters in the House were sympathetic about the vice
president's plight.
   ``I think Bush has to say, as he has for seven years, as long as
we're asking what he would do as vice president, he will support
the president of the United States,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia. ``He can talk about how he would take the offensive in '89
in other ways, but I think it would be very, very foolish to allow
himself to be drawn into day by day picky fights.''
   But others weren't so concerned about ``picky fights.''
   ``What I'd like to see would be Bush coming out on more of the
issues and articulating the positions that he has,'' said Molinari.
``I think he's beginning to do that now.''

   The 20th anniversary production of
``Hair,'' the rock musical that shocked the world with frontal
nudity, will be shown in a demure version at a United Nations
benefit for children suffering from AIDS.
   Some say a show that celebrates carefree love and drug use is
not the best choice to raise money to fight AIDS, a fatal disease
transmitted by sexual contact and sharing of intravenous needles.
   The one-night presentation Thursday at the General Assembly Hall
has been watered down to avoid eliciting blushes from diplomats.
Four-letter words are edited out, free spirits will have to cover
themselves with fig leaves and there will be no burning of U.S.
draft cards.
   ``This is a modified version for the United Nations,'' one of
the creators, James Rado, said. ``The street language had to go in
a United Nations format. I guess they couldn't take the four-letter
words. There aren't that many of them.''
   ``But the U.N. just said `No,''' added co-author Gerome Ragni.
   At the end of the first act, the cast will not stand singing in
the nude before the audience. That was in 1968. This is a swishy,
black-tie affair for the Establishment where the best seats cost
$5,000.
   ``The first lady would say no to drug songs,'' production
manager David Bosboom said in an interview, referring to Nancy
Reagan's anti-drug campaign whose slogan is, ``Just say no to
drugs.''
   Mrs. Reagan, an honorary chairman of the benefit, will not be
present to hear the 1988 rendition of the songs ``Starshine'' and
the ``Age of Aquarius,'' although she consults astrologers.
President Reagan and his wife leave for the Moscow summit this
morning.
   Publicist Rebecca Robbins said that when ``Hair'' opened 20
years ago at New York's Public Theater the stars were in almost the
same positions as they will be Thursday.
   Wanda Moore, the original ``Hair'' astrologer who now calls
herself Vanessa Talma-Lord, has worked out the astrological chart
for the show.
   ``The moon again is in the seventh house and Jupiter is aligned
with Mars,'' said the astrologer.
   Bosboom quipped that ``There will be no naked truths here at the
U.N.,'' but that the soul of the show has remained intact.
   ``Yes, we had to change the content to suit the United
Nations,'' he said. ``The themes are there but some lyrics have
changed.''
   He said the numerous changes were made both out of
self-censorship by the creators and at the request of nervous U.N.
bureaucrats.
   One U.N. official muttered privately that the show was
``ill-considered, inappropriate and an embarrassment.
   ``How do you have a show celebrating free love and sex at the
United Nations, of all places, when you are trying to warn against
AIDS?'' said the official who demanded anonymity.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, also is
transmitted through contaminated blood or blood products and from
infected mothers to their unborn babies. The AIDS virus attacks the
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and
cancers.
   Ragni and Rado have written 14 new songs and the first half of
the new prodution is an update ``for the next generation.'' The
second half is a nostalgic selection of oldies.
   ``Sodomy,'' a song from the original, won't be sung at
Thursday's production. It is now an instrumental by Chuck Mangione.
   ``Some of the songs we had to delete, because out of context
from the original show, they don't work,'' Ragni said in a recent
interview.
   Of ``Sodomy,'' he said: ``It's quite beautiful and effective and
I never had heard it as an instrumental.''
   The changes have been made to address current issues, such as
the depletion of the Ozone layer and banning nuclear bombs.
   Deletions do away with the Vietnam War hippie protest song about
LBJ taking the IRT to find people on LSD.
   But there still is crooning over ``Donna'' and the search for
the ``16-year-old virgin.''
   ``I'm surprised they left that one in,'' said Bosboom.
   The production involves more than 100 people and includes some
members of the original cast. A few of the original players decided
not to take part when they learned that conservative William F.
Buckley was a member of the sponsoring Creo Society. It is a
non-profit organization working with the United Nations Children's
Fund to help young AIDS victims.
   The Creo Society Fund For Children With AIDS is trying to raise
more than $2 million from the benefit.

<HEAD>Reagan To Rest In Finland, the Way Station to Russia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of all European capitals, Helsinki is
probably the most fitting way station for President Reagan before
his Moscow summit next week.
   Geographically and historically, neutral Finland sees itself as
the no-man's land between East and West.
   It also has great saunas, as the president may have heard from
George Shultz. The secretary of state has made four rest stops in
Helsinki in less than three years on his way to Moscow, and
reportedly has become an enthusiast of the traditional Finnish
sweat bath.
   Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Helsinki early Thursday
morning, and will spend three nights there recovering from jet lag
and preparing for his May 29-June 2 summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In his only scheduled activities outside his regular Saturday
radio address, Reagan will meet Friday with President Mauno
Koivisto and then address Finnish leaders on human rights.
   He will speak in Finlandia Hall, where 35 heads of state signed
the 1975 Helsinki Accords on military security, economic
cooperation and humanitarian issues.
   American Jewish leaders have announced they will hold a vigil in
Helsinki during Reagan's stay to draw attention to the demands by
Soviet Jews for freedom to emigrate.
   Though Reagan probably won't see much of the city, Helsinki's
Russian flavor offers him a taste of things to come. With its
trolley cars, broad avenues and 19th century buildings, the city
has been used as a set for ``Gorky Park'' and other movies about
Russia.
   Most of Helsinki was devastated by fire in 1808, the same year
Sweden ended its 600-year rule of Finland and ceded the territory
to Russia. It was a Russian duchy until 1917.
   Finland's life in Russia's shadow has been the theme of its
politics for centuries. It shares a 793-mile border with the Soviet
Union, the longest of any non-communist state.
   The Finns like to say they were ``defeated, but not conquered''
by the Soviets in World War II, since they retained an independent
government and parliament. But they were forced to cede territory,
pay reparations and sign a Treaty of Cooperation and Friendship.
   Their post-war caution toward the Soviets gave rise to the term
``Finlandization'' as a synonym for obsequiousness in a country's
foreign policy.
   ``With all my heart, I would like that word to be abolished,''
Prime Minister Harri Holkeri said with uncharacteristic anger
during a Washington news conference last month.
   Holkeri, who took office in April 1987, is the first prime
minister from the Conservative Party since the war. Before last
year, the party was frozen out of government in deference to Moscow
because of its staunchly anti-Soviet image.
   Finns defend their policy by saying they are nobody's lackey.
   ``Having for long felt themselves to be menaced by the East and
let down by the West, the Finnish people today feel they are
getting the best of both worlds,'' writes Max Jakobson, a former
Finnish ambassador to the United Nations.
   ``The supreme test for Finland has been to find a way to live in
peace with her powerful neighbor without giving up her own system
of government and her ties with the Western world,'' Jakobson wrote
in ``Finland: Myth and Reality'' published last year.
   During the last year Finland has increasingly turned away from
the Soviets and more toward Western Europe.
   In April, it decided to join the Council of Europe, which it
once saw as an instrument of the Cold War. Finland had been the
only major non-communist European country to stay outside the
council, which monitors human rights in Europe.
   Trade with the Soviets dropped from 25 percent of Finland's
total two years ago to 15 percent last year. More than 60 percent
of Finland's trade is with Western Europe, and about five percent
is with the United States.

<HEAD>GM Says No Mechanical Cause Found to Account for Acceleration
Reports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it has found no
mechanical cause of sudden acceleration in its C-body and H-body
cars and says the federal investigations of complaints don't mean a
defect exists.
   The automaker made the statement after the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday it had opened an
engineering evaluation of 1.4 million 1985-88 C-body cars,
including the Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra and Cadillac Deville and
Fleetwood.
   The agency last year began an investigation of 703,000 GM H-body
cars, including the 1986-87 Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Buick LeSabre,
and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville.
   In another matter, General Motors has dropped a challenge to an
order from the Environmental Protection Agency and will recall
82,600 Pontiacs and Buicks from the 1981 model year to fix
pollution control systems, EPA said Tuesday.
   Also, a federal appeals court Tuesday upheld NHTSA's refusal to
reopen an investigation of alleged safety defects in 1966-1979 Ford
cars.
   NHTSA said it had received 110 complaints involving GM's C-body
cars, including reports of 67 accidents resulting in 43 injuries.
   The agency has received more than 500 complaints about sudden
acceleration in the H-body cars, including reports of more than 300
accidents.
   The H-car and C-car investigations are separate cases on the
NHTSA docket.
   ``We have never been able to find a common design flaw or
manufacturing defect,'' said GM spokesman David Hudgens. ``We've
never been able to determine a cause for these incidents.
   ``There is nobody that denies there are incidents of so-called
sudden acceleration, in ours and other cars, but we've never been
able to pin down an engineering or manfacturing root cause for
them,'' he said.
   The C-body and H-body cars use the same V-6 engine, but ``nobody
has indicted the engine,'' Hudgens said.
   The C-car investigation was started at the request of the Center
for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group often critical
of the auto industry and its regulators. Sam Cole of the center
said design similarities suggested a connection between sudden
acceleration reports in the C-body and H-body cars.
   Sudden acceleration allegations in recent years have involved
nearly every auto manufacturer, NHTSA said.
   The agency has conducted about 50 investigations into sudden
acceleration involving vehicles made by 20 manufacturers.
   NHTSA's latest defect investigation report, covering April,
showed four other ongoing engineering analyses and cases involving
alleged sudden acceleration or throttle control problems.
   They involved the 1986-88 Honda Acura and Sterling and the
1986-87 Mercedes 300E, as well as two that have resulted in
recalls: the 1979-87 Nissan 280Z and 300Z and the 1978-86 Audi 5000.
   In the EPA case, the cars in question are equipped with a
4.3-liter, six-cylinder engine and were sold as the Pontiac LeMans,
Lemans Wagon, Grand Prix, Catalina, Bonneville and Firebird, and as
the Buick Regal, Century and Century Wagon.
   GM said it believes the cars comply but it is dropping the
challenge ``to prevent unnecessary litigation.''
   The Ford decision reversed an earlier ruling by the same court
that the Center for Auto Safety could seek judicial review of the
agency's refusal to reopen a case involving Ford transmissions that
have a tendency to slip into reverse gear.
   Clarence Ditlow III, executive director of the center, said
there still were 8 million cars with the allegedly defective
transmissions on the road.

   Five relatives, including a man once
accused of helping convicted spy Christopher Boyce rob banks, were
arrested for trying to smuggle 45 tons of marijuana and hashish
into the country, authorities said.
   ``The war on drugs is being fought on many fronts. This is one
of the skirmishes. This is a battle we happen to have won,'' said
Agent Tom Sheehan of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   At least 30 tons of hashish and 15 tons of marijuana were seized
from welded compartments of a barge after it was boarded Monday
night as it entered San Francisco Bay. The tug Intrepid Venture,
which had the barge in tow, also was seized.
   Authorities believe the Asian-grown drugs, with a wholesale
value of $162 million, had been loaded off a ``mother ship'' 1,000
miles offshore. It took eight hours for agents to cut metal covers
off the compartments to remove the contraband.
   ``This was a very sophisticated operation,'' said Rollin B.
Klink, agent in charge for the Customs Service in San Francisco,
who characterized the organization behind the operation as ``huge.''
   He said ``a piece of minor'' information led to the bust, but
would not elaborate.
   ``We knew about this boat before it was ever loaded,'' added
Steve Giorgi, head of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The tug's skipper, Calvin Robinson, 47, of Napa, and four
relatives were charged Tuesday in federal court with large-scale
drug smuggling and conspiracy, punishable by at least 10 years in
prison without the possibility of parole and fines of up to $4
million.
   According to court documents, Robinson was a prison compatriot
of Boyce, who was convicted in 1977 of espionage for the Soviet
Union. Robinson reportedly went on the lam with Boyce after his
sensational Jan. 19, 1980, escape from the federal prison at
Lompoc. Boyce, whose exploits were portrayed in the book and movie
``The Falcon and the Snowman,'' was serving a 40-year sentence.
   Robinson was charged with harboring a fugitive and in connection
with 13 Pacific Northwest bank robberies that occurred after
Boyce's capture in late 1981. But the charges against Robinson were
dismissed by U.S. District Judge Harold Ryan in Idaho for lack of
evidence. Boyce pleaded guilty to the robberies and received 25
additional years in prison.
   Also arrested in the drug bust were Robinson's 25-year-old son,
William, of Vacaville; the skipper's nephews Frank Robinson, 25, of
Corning and John Robinson, 23, of Santa Rosa; and stepson, Wesley
Bastin, 25, of Corning, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Swenson.
   About 1,400 plastic-wrapped cardboard boxes filled with
Southeast Asian marijuana and 1,200 burlap bags of pressed hashish
were found in the tug.
   The 70-foot tug left San Francisco Bay with the barge in tow in
early May, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Graham, head of the
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
   Drug agents tracked the vessels part of the way to the mother
ship and back. The whereabouts of that ship remain unknown.
   Boyce was convicted in 1977 of selling U.S. satellite
surveillance secrets to the Soviet Union from the TRW company in
Redondo Beach, where he had worked from mid-1974 to 1976 as a
security clerk. Boyce is now serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary
in Marion, Ill.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
and his European colleagues in NATO will discuss financial
contributions to the military alliance at a two-day meeting
scheduled to begin Thursday.
   The alliance's European defense ministers will gather today for
a routine meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
   U.S. congressional critics of NATO claim the European NATO
nations don't pay enough for the common Western defense and have
threatened to withdraw some of the 320,000 American troops in
Europe.
   Such criticism has risen as constraints in the United States
budget get tighter.
   The European allies counter that most of the air, land and sea
forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are European.
   ``It's a question of convincing (the U.S. Congress) that what
the Europeans do reflects a fair assumption ... of the common
defense burden,'' said a senior NATO official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said NATO ministers will set up a panel to review the
financial issue and hope to present a report by year's end.
   Carlucci will attend the meeting on his way to join President
Reagan at the Moscow summit.
   The NATO defense chiefs also will approve goals for each of the
16 members for 1989-1994, NATO officials said. The ministers were
expected to adopt 26 long-term force goals, 23 of these dealing
with planning for arms systems to be operational by the late 1990s.
   The ministers also will consider a multinational force to offset
Canada's decision to end the commitment of its Air-Sea
Transportable brigade to reinforce northern Norway in times of
crisis, the officials said.
   Canada announced a year ago that it would end its commitment in
order to consolidate its forces in West Germany.
   The NATO ministers were expected to ask Italy to take in 72 U.S.
F-16 jetfighters that are to be removed from the U.S. air base at
Torrejon near Madrid. Spain's government, under domestic political
pressure, asked for their removal.
   In Washington, Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV told
the House Armed Services Committee he expects Italy will agree to
be host for the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing.

<HEAD>Superpowers Hint At Readiness to Reduce Military Forces in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After four decades of mind-boggling spending
for weapons and 15 years of go-nowhere negotiations, the
superpowers are making hopeful noises about reducing military
forces in Europe.
   It goes beyond the peace rhetoric President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev have voiced at their summits in Geneva,
Reykjavik and Washington.
   Moscow has conceded for the first time that it does indeed have
an advantage over the West in some military categories. Red Army
leaders hint they may no longer feel the need for such superiority.
   ``It appears that in 1988 both East and West are ready for a new
beginning,'' says Thomas J. Hirschfeld, who spent 1979 to 1982 as a
U.S. representative to the multilateral Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction talks that have dragged on inconclusively since 1973.
   Reagan was said to be prepared to touch on the need for
conventional disarmament, in a speech in Helsinki, Finland, on his
way to the May 29-June 2 summit, but there's no telling what he and
Gorbachev might do on the issue.
   U.S. officials are bracing for the possibility that Gorbachev
will suggest that the two superpowers meet this fall to discuss
cutting their ground forces in Europe by as much as 25 percent.
   One official raised the possibility that Gorbachev might wait
until after the summit to announce a unilateral withdrawal of
50,000 to 70,000 troops. Another official said 100,000 troops could
be pulled back.
   After Secretary of State George P. Shultz attended a pre-summit
planning session with the Soviets earlier this month there was
little talk of conventional weaponry being a major topic at the
summit. Optimism on the issue focused on the possibility of a
mid-July agreement on a mandate for lower level negotiations, the
Conventional Stability Talks.
   Before they begin such talks, the Western participants want
further Eastern European compliance with human rights accords
signed in 1975. Still, U.S. officials are hoping the problems can
be settled in time for the CST conference to begin in October.
   ``Of course, the CST talks will not reach agreement overnight
and, indeed, it will be well into the next U.S. president's term
before they produce results,'' said former Capitol Hill staff
member Thomas Longstreth, in a study for the Federation of American
Scientists.
   ``With time and patience, the logjam can be broken and a new era
of stability in Europe achieved,'' Longstreth wrote.
   Since the end of World War II, Red Army forces in Europe have
been dominated by huge armies of men, tanks and artillery suitable
for attack. By Pentagon estimates, the Soviets have 230 divisions,
compared with 121 for NATO; an edge of 52,000-to-24,250 in main
battle tanks and a 42,000-to-18,350 edge in artillery.
   The Soviets have said they need such forces to keep the military
balance. In a speech last year, however, Gorbachev acknowledged
that ``asymmetries'' exist in the force comparisons and said the
goal of each side should be ``reasonable sufficiency,'' rather than
superiority.
   In a letter to a group of Western scientists last November,
Gorbachev said forces on both sides should be structured to
``provide all that is needed for the repulsion of any possible
aggression but could not be used for offensive purposes.''
   There is no evidence the Soviets have put such doctrines into
effect. And they note that there are ``asymmetries'' in favor of
the West, notably in the number of ground-attack planes.
   U.S. experts like Longstreth note as well that negotiations to
reduce conventional weapons are a monumental prospect because so
many different types of armaments, units and national interests are
involved.
   State Department officials have suggested that as a first step,
both sides should try to reduce forces that could be used in a
surprise attack and should institute confidence-building measures
that reduce fear of such an attack.
   Steps in that direction have already been taken under an
agreement that has led to an increase in the number of observers
each bloc has been sending to the other side's war games.
   The NATO allies will be paying particular attention to any
developments in this field at the Moscow summit. Now that
medium-range missiles are to be banned under the pact signed last
December at the Washington meeting, the allies are zeroing in on
conventional forces as their next arms control target.
   ``Under Gorbachev, the Soviets have voiced an apparent
willingness to embrace arms control concepts which just a few years
ago would have seemed unattainable,'' Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said recently.
   He added: ``A word of caution is in order. It is too soon to
determine how many of these concepts can be translated into
reality. In areas such as conventional arms control, we must put
Soviet rhetoric to the test with bold innovative proposals of our
own.''

<HEAD>Text Of Reagan's Message On Veto Of Trade Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Reagan-Trade Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's veto
message Tuesday on the trade bill.
   To the House of Representatives:
   It is with sincere regret that today I must disapprove and
return HR 3, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.
   We worked long and hard to produce legislation that would
enhance our country's ability to meet foreign competition head-on _
to strengthen our trade laws and remove restrictions on America's
great economic engine.
   And we came very close to developing such a bill.
   Unfortunately, as the process came to a close, provisions were
included that simply make this bill, on balance, bad for America _
particularly working men and women.
   The criteria I used in reaching this decision were whether this
legislation will create jobs and help sustain our economic growth.
   I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our economic
growth.
   During this administration the American economy has created 16
million new jobs.
   Our unemployment rate is the lowest in 14 years, with more
Americans working than ever before in our history.
   And we are experiencing the longest peacetime expansion this
country has ever seen.
   While this has been going on at home, many of our trading
partners have had a different economic situation.
   Perhaps the most compelling and important comparison is that
over the past decade, the United States has created more than twice
as many jobs as Europe and Japan combined.
   The United States economy, which foreign leaders have dubbed the
``American miracle,'' is not a freak accident or a statistical
curiosity.
   It is the result of seven years of consistent policies: lower
tax rates, reduced regulation, control returned to state and local
governments.
   The Washington tendency to have government be all things to all
people has been reversed, and we have gotten government off the
backs of the American people.
   In contrast, many foreign countries remain hamstrung by archaic
policies and are now trying to remove these impediments, to reform
tax systems, to make labor markets more flexible, and to encourage
entrepreneurs.
   That is not to say that we cannot do more here at home _ we can.
   That is why I forwarded proposals to improve our competitive
strength and why we worked hard with the Congress to try to achieve
a positive, forward-looking bill.
   Unfortunately, that is not the bill the Congress passed and sent
to my desk.
   The issue receiving the most attention in this bill is the
mandatory requirement for businesses to give advance notice of
closings or layoffs.
   I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes
necessary.
   It allows the workers, the employer, the community, time to
adjust to the dislocation.
   It is the humane thing to do.
   But I object to the idea that the federal government would
arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all
circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification
should take place.
   There are many circumstances under which such mandatory
notification would actually force a faltering business to close _
by driving away creditors, suppliers, customers, and in the process
destroying jobs.
   While the legislation attempts to mitigate this outcome, its
``faltering business'' exemption is too ambiguous to be workable
and invites untold litigation.
   These concerns are real, not simply philosophical or theoretical.
   The experience of the Caterpillar Co. in the early 1980s, for
example, is indicative of the need to be flexible to meet foreign
competition and indeed to survive.
   They had to utilize layoffs and temporary plant closings to
respond to competitive developments.
   And, as one executive of that company stated, they did not have
the luxury then, nor do they now, of knowing with certainty what
business conditions would be like 60 days in the future.
   Without the ability to be agile and responsive, they might have
closed their doors permanently.

<HEAD>WASHN: doors permanently.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar's experience is repeated many times over throughout
our economy.
   One independent analysis shows that if this law had been in
place between 1982 and 1986, the United States would have produced
almost one-half million fewer jobs.
   And that is what this debate is about _ creating jobs and
keeping them _ not losing jobs by the straitjacket of regulations.
   Over a year ago, I submitted legislation that would provide
assistance to workers, employers, and communities in the event of a
layoff or closing.
   The program would serve virtually every dislocated worker who
needs it with training, education, and assistance in securing a new
job and provide an incentive for giving advance notice of layoffs
and closings.
   Ironically, the one piece of that package that the Congress
rejected was a direct incentive for business to give advance
notices of closing and layoffs.
   We need labor laws that fit the flexible, fast-paced economy of
the 1990s, not restrictive leftovers from the 1930s agenda.
   And I encourage the Congress in any subsequent trade bill to
include a program that provides incentives for such notice.
   There are other provisions in the legislation that provide
disincentives to our sustained economic growth or serve some narrow
special interests:
   _New restrictions on the export, transportation, and even
utilization of Alaskan oil further complicate the overbearing
regulatory scheme that already impedes the development of Alaskan
oil fields.
   It is the wrong policy. We need to provide incentives, not
restrictions, for the production of oil in the United States so
that we can reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers.
   Further, as the Congress has now recognized, it amounts to an
unconstitutional discrimination against a single state.
   _A mistaken effort to revive discredited industrial policy
planning through a so-alled council on competitiveness that will
open even more venues for special pleaders.
   _A requirement to negotiate a new centralized international
institution to arrange the forgiveness of billions of dollars of
debt around the world _ all supposedly without increasing U.S.
taxes or adding to our debt.
   _Expanded ethanol imports that could harm U.S. grain producers.
   _An amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act that prevents
the president from moving swiftly to block blatant enemy propaganda
material from entering the United States, even during wartime.
   While the Congress did a remarkable job in watering down or
eliminating the most protectionist provisions, there remain
sections of the bill that push us in the direction of protectionism.
   Closing our borders is not the solution to opening foreign
markets.
   We need to demand to be treated fairly and take a strong stand
against barriers abroad.
   In short, we need to open markets, not close them.
   While there are objectionable portions of the bill, there are
also desirable provisions.
   There is negotiating authority so that the next president will
have congressional support to continue to seek agreements that open
markets abroad.
   That, coupled with new trade law tools to strengthen the hand of
America in international trade negotiations, will mean that this
country can enter the next decade with new agreements that reduce
barriers and encourage trade.
   There are strengthened protections for intellectual property,
such as copyrights, and a reduction in various handicaps to U.S.
exporters.
   Finally, the bill would remove a major impediment to U.S. oil
production by repealing the windfall profits tax.
   That is why I want a trade bill, and why I like much of this
bill.
   But I regret that the addition of a few counterproductive and
costly measures outweigh the positive features of this particular
legislation.
   I will continue to work vigorously to secure sound legislation
this year.
   Let me reiterate what I have said on a number of occasions.
   I am committed to enactment of a responsible trade bill this
year.
   I have heard some say that there is not time to send me a second
bill after my veto is sustained; my response is that there are many
months left in 1988 _ time to sign a trade bill this year.
   I urge prompt action on a second bill immediately after the
Congress sustains my veto.
   (Signed)
   Ronald Reagan

   Here at a glance are the provisions of the
trade bill that President Reagan vetoed on Tuesday:
   _Expands the authority of the U.S. trade representative to
retaliate against trading practices by other nations that are
considered unfair.
   _Tightens laws against trading partners found to be dumping
goods in the United States and eases procedures for imposing import
curbs.
   _Imposes a 0.15 percent import fee to finance benefits for those
left jobless in industries in which plants close because of import
competition.
   _Requires all but the smallest businesses to give employees 60
days notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   _Eases the anti-bribery Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in some
cases ending U.S. criminal liability for paying bribes to officials
overseas.
   _Repeals the tax on windfall oil-company profits.
   _Provides for a billion-dollar increases in subsidies to
exporters of agricultural products.
   _Empowers the president to halt any acquisition, merger or
takeover of an American firm by a foreign company if he finds that
action would jeopardize national security.
   _Eases export curbs on high-tech equipment restricted because of
its potential military uses.
   _Imposes sanctions on Japan's Toshiba Corp. and the Norwegian
company Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk for selling the Soviet Union
equipment that aids in making submarines quieter and thus harder to
detect.

<HEAD>South Africa To Begin Evicting Black Settlers Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it will
begin evicting 1,800 blacks next month from a settlement designated
for people of mixed race. Civil rights workers called the plan a
revival of forced removals.
   In another development, state radio reported that a black had
spoken for the first time in an official proceeding at South
Africa's Parliament building.
   Blacks make up 75 percent of South Africa's 35 million people
but have no representation in Parliament and no vote in national
affairs.
   In announcing the planned evictions at Lawaiicamp, white
officials said on Tuesday that the 40-year-old black community is
an illegal, unsanitary squatter camp. They deny the actions will
constitute forced removal.
   But residents of Lawaiicamp say they are determined to stay
where they are.
   In 1984, President P.W. Botha said there would be no more forced
removals of the sort that resettled an estimated 3.5 million people
from 1950 to 1983.
   But critics say the policy continues under different names, such
as ``slum clearance'' and ``squatter control.''
   Lawaiicamp adjoins the township of George, which Botha
represented in Parliament before becoming president in 1984, and is
five miles from a scenic stretch of Indian Ocean coastline east of
Cape Town.
   The government wants to move Lawaiicamp residents to Sandkraal,
about a mile further from George, which was established four years
ago to be the area's official black township.
   George's mayor, John Rogers, told a news conference on Tuesday
that Lawaiicamp residents have until May 31 to move voluntarily.
The town council plans to apply for eviction orders in court on
June 1 and to demolish the 180 remaining Lawaiicamp homes once they
are vacated.
   Rogers said evicted families will be paid compensation and
provided with new homes. About 800 families have already moved from
Lawaiicamp to Sandkraal, and the government claims they enjoy
better services and amenities.
   The mayor said violence would not be used against residents
resisting eviction, but did not explain how this could be assured.
   The current Parliament member for George, Hennie Smit, said
Lawaiicamp is illegal because it is on land designated for use by
people of mixed race. A new mixed-race township is to be developed
on the site.
   In early 1986, the government tried to evict Lawaiicamp
residents but backed off because of legal challenges and stiff
resistance. This time, the government says it will not yield.
   The precedent-setting speech by a black at South Africa's
Parliament building came on Tuesday during committee debate in Cape
Town on the proposed budget for Cape Province.
   Temba Nyati, a black appointed last year to the provincial
executive committee, spoke about the importance of municipal
government.
   He later told the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
blacks should view participation in local government as a first
step toward sharing power at higher levels.
   A new constitution in 1984 created the Asian and mixed-race
chambers of Parliament but still excluded the black majority from
national affairs.
   The white chamber is able to get its say on all major
legislative issues.

<HEAD>Proxmire Chides White House on Stock Market Report, Promises Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. William Proxmire says he will try to push
stock market reform legislation to the Senate floor next month,
even though Reagan administration officials say that the need for
such a measure is dubious.
   Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, chided four
federal officials who appeared before the panel on Tuesday for
producing a report on last fall's stock market crash that suggested
there is scant need for legislation.
   ``I can tell you, we're going to go ahead'' with a bill, said
Proxmire, D-Wis.
   Proxmire told the authors of the study that they had made
``pitiful'' progress in formulating suggestions for calming the
nation's jittery financial exchanges and nervous investors. The
four officials were Treasury Undersecretary George D. Gould,
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S. Ruder,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``You have let down the American people at a critical time,''
Proxmire told the officials.
   Gould, who headed the White House team that wrote the report,
sidestepped several questions about when the group would suggest
needed legislation, saying, ``We're not legislatively driven, we're
decision driven.''
   The working group's report, released May 16, suggested several
mild steps for dealing with the markets' ills.
   They included a call for an hourlong trading halt in the
nation's stock, futures and options markets if the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunges by 250 points in a single day. Such a
decline has occurred only once: last Oct. 19's 508-point drop,
which has triggered on ongoing look at the markets' volatility by
the government and Congress.
   Proxmire introduced legislation on March 31 that would establish
a committee consisting of the chairmen of the Federal Reserve
Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The committee would oversee issues that
affect all of the nation's markets, such as coordinating margins _
or downpayments _ exchanged in transactions, and setting up
``circuit breakers'' to halt trading during emergencies.
   ``My aim ... is to make sure that there is an accountable entity
with both the responsibility and the expertise to make the
decisions on intermarket issues,'' Proxmire said.
   Currently, the CFTC oversees the futures markets, while the SEC
and the Fed share responsibility for the stock and options
exchanges.
   After the hearing, Proxmire told reporters he expected his
committee to send the legislation to the full Senate in June.
   With Congress' schedule abbreviated this year because of the
elections _ and with some lawmakers joining the administration in
opposing strong legislative action on the problem _ it seems
unlikely that any bill will become law in 1988.
   ``It makes it much harder to have the administration opposed,''
Proxmire conceded. ``The president has the veto, and the
administration has influence with many members of Congress.''
   Sentiment on the banking committee on the need for legislation
seems split, and not along party lines.
   While Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``We'd be darned fools
to say that all is well'' with the financial markets, Sen. John
Shelby, D-Ala., said, ``A lot of us here ... don't believe you can
legislate investors' confidence.''
   Ruder has dissented from his colleagues on several points,
arguing that futures margins should be raised and that the SEC
should oversee futures trading. The SEC meets Thursday to fashion
legislative proposals that will be submitted to Congress by next
week.

<TEXT>
   Karoly Grosz, Hungary's new Communist
Party leader, said he will speed up economic reforms planned for
late in the year, but cautioned Hungarians not to expect a swift
economic turnaround.
   He also conceded that since he became prime minister in June
1987, his government has failed to revitalize Hungary's sluggish
economy.
   ``Thirty years of accumulated tension cannot be dissolved
overnight,'' he told the government newspaper Magyar Hirlap on
Tuesday in his first lengthy interview since being named party
general secretary two days earlier.
   ``The danger of the reform is the accompanying illusions. Many
think that we shall pass 10 reforms and the country's situation
will change. This is not so,'' he said.
   The 57-year-old Grosz will continue as premier at least until
Parliament announces a new head of government.
   He replaced longtime party chief Janos Kadar, a hardliner.
   Grosz said financial moves alone could not solve this nation's
economic crisis and acknowledged that some political change must
accompany the new measures. He said appointing new Cabinet
ministers and choosing a new head of government probably would take
place this fall.
   He praised Kadar and said that the idea of naming Kadar party
president, a new post that is expected to be largely ceremonial,
was ``the result of the past few weeks.''
   This indicated prolonged haggling over whether Kadar, who turns
76 on Thursday, would give up the party leadership he held nearly
32 years.
   Grosz said Kadar's new post would let him use his vast
experience in international affairs _ an indication that Grosz
expects Kadar to keep out of day-to-day internal politics.
   Kadar was dropped from the Politburo along with seven other
party veterans in Sunday's reshuffle.
   Grosz said it is important that the new 11-member Politburo
include such people as Reszo Nyers, the father of Hungary's
economic reforms in the 1960s, and Imre Pozsgay, another outspoken
advocate of political reform.
   As premier, Grosz pushed stringent measures to curb Hungary's 18
percent inflation rate and $18 billion foreign debt. But he
admitted the austerity measures so far failed to halt stagnation.
   A new party policy statement approved on Sunday advocates more
foreign investment, joint ventures and loosening restrictions on
the ownership of foreign capital.
   It calls for changes allowing Hungarians a greater voice in
economic and political affairs, including a major expansion of
private initiatives.
   Hungary's economic crisis with the attendant loss of confidence
in the Communist Party prompted the birth of many independent
interest groups, demanding a voice.

<HEAD>House-Passed Bill Would Block Military Exports To Terrorist
Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congress is moving forward with legislation
that could prevent another Iran-Contra affair by establishing
precise rules governing when a president must tell Congress of
dealings with terrorist countries.
   In the latest attempt to turn the lessons learned from the
affair into law, the House on Tuesday approved by voice vote a bill
designed chiefly to prevent exports of military equipment to
terrorist nations, like Iran.
   But the legislation, sent to the Senate, permits the president
to deal with such countries if he believes the national interest is
at stake _ and if he adheres to strict notification requirements to
Congress.
   Since the bill permits the president some flexibility, the
Reagan administration does not oppose the legislation, according to
administration foreign policy supporter Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   The House bill is the second major attempt by Congress to avoid
another Iran-Contra affair.
   The Senate earlier this year passed a bill, which is still
pending in the House, that would require the president to notify
Congress of any covert intelligence operation within 48 hours after
its authorization. Current law merely provides for timely
notification.
   The Reagan administration considers that requirement too rigid
and opposes the legislation.
   The new House bill requires notification to Congress in a much
broader array of circumstances than just covert actions. The
coverage would include transfer of weapons and foreign aid money,
which may or may not be secret.
   In the Iran-Contra affair, President Reagan did not tell
Congress he had authorized the sales to Iran until after the secret
operation was revealed in a Middle East publication.
   Iran is one of six nations designated by the State Department as
a terrorist country. The other countries are Cuba, Iran, Libya,
North Korea, North Yemen and Syria.
   Current law is supposed to prevent such weapons sales, but
failed to do so.
   Hyde, a member of the former House Iran-Contra committee, called
the bill ``one of the thoughtful responses to the Iran-Contra
hearings.
   ``One of the big problems (in the Iran-Contra affair) was the
transfer of weapons to the Iranians and nobody knew about it,'' he
said. ``In this bill, the president still has his constitutional
power to execute his foreign policy functions.''
   The latest bill would prohibit any American from exporting arms
to a terrorist state, whether the individual is a government
employee, a private citizen or someone acting on behalf of the
government.
   The secret network that controlled weapons sales to Iran and use
of some profits to aid the Nicaraguan Contras was directed by
former National Security Council staffer Oliver L. North. He, in
turn, enlisted two businessmen to run the logistics of the
operations: Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   Under the legislation, the State Department would form its list
of terrorist nations by determining whether a country repeatedly
supported acts of international terrorism or granted sanctuary to
international terrorists.
   The president could delete a nation from the list. But he must
report to Congress that a fundamental change in leadership and
character has taken place, that the country has not supported
international terrorism for the preceding six months, and that
government provided assurances it would not support future acts of
terrorism. The deletion could not take place until 30 days after
the report was submitted.
   The legislation would require a validated license before goods
or technology could be exported to terrorist states, if such
exports would significantly contribute to the military potential of
the country or enhance its ability to support terrorism.
   The State Department must notify Congress 30 days before issuing
a validated license.
   The president would be able to waive export restrictions for
national security reasons, and could provide foreign assistance to
a terrorist nation for humanitarian purposes.
   But first, the president must give Congress a 15-day advance
notification, and a report containing all the details of the
proposed transaction.
   The legislation would retain current penalties for violating
restrictions on exports or aid to terrorist countries: a maximum of
$1 million in fines and 10 years in prison for criminal violations,
and up to $500,000 for civil penalties.

<HEAD>Shultz Says US Will Make New Missile Proposals At Moscow Summit</HEAD>

   The United States will make new proposals at
the Moscow summit to keep track of elusive mobile missiles in a
move to complete a treaty sharply reducing strategic nuclear
arsenals, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said.
   So far, U.S. and Soviet negotiators have been unable to find
ways to count the missiles that would be left on both sides if
stockpiles are slashed. This, in turn, keeps the superpowers from
deciding whether to include mobile missiles in an arms reduction
treaty.
   While verification is extremely difficult, the Reagan
administration is not ready to insist on banning the elusive
weapons and give up hope of retaining some of these potent
long-range missiles in the U.S. arsenal, Shultz said Tuesday.
   ``They are harder to find, so they are more survivable and
therefore don't invite a first strike,'' Shultz told news agency
reporters in a pre-summit interview. ``So that adds something to
stability.''
   But he acknowledged their elusiveness poses an extreme problem
for arms control. ``So you have to find a balance, a compromise,''
Shultz said.
   Negotiations on a new treaty are stymied over the U.S.
anti-missile program, known popularly as Star Wars, and over
verifying reductions in mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried
on fighter planes and warships.
   The treaty is supposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet strategic
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent. At the same time, the two
sides want to devise foolproof ways of verifying weapons are not
retained illegally.
   Shultz said U.S. negotiators in Geneva had already proposed some
ideas on how to keep track of mobile missiles. At the Moscow
summit, he said, ``We will propose additional ones that refine
things and give them more detail.''
   He said the Reagan administration also would pursue at the
summit a system for sending observers to suspect sites with little
advance warning.
   While the treaty cannot be completed in time for the summit,
Shultz said there was still a chance of finishing it before
President Reagan leaves office next January.
   ``It's possible,'' he said. ``I don't know whether it will
actually happen or not. There are very knowledgeable people on both
sides working to bring it about. But the problems are very
difficult.''
   And yet, he said the Soviets evidently want to keep at it,
instead of waiting for the next administration to take over.
   ``They are in a negotiating process with people who are
knowledgeable, competent, and are engaged,'' Shultz said. ``So
they, as we, want to make as much progress as is possible.''

<HEAD>Administration Supports Denying Convicted Drug Smugglers Their
Passports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says there is
widespread support in the Reagan administration for legislation
that would separate convicted narcotics smugglers from their
passports.
   Meese made the comment as President Reagan asked congressional
leaders on Tuesday for help in creating a bipartisan task force on
drugs.
   Reagan has asked that the task force lay out its proposals in a
report to him and the congressional leadership within 45 days.
   One proposal it will almost certainly examine involves
additional penalties for passport holders involved with drugs.
   Currently, passports can be seized as evidence if someone is
found to be smuggling narcotics into the United States.
   But there is no penalty provision to deny convicted narcotics
offenders their passports.
   Meese said he believes a majority of the Cabinet-level National
Drug Policy Board, which he heads, favors legislation to enact such
a penalty.
   He said legislation is being contemplated and that ``we will be
proposing a lot of ideas in the course of these meetings with
Congress.''
   Reagan named White House chief of staff Howard Baker, Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and national security advisor Colin
Powell as well as Meese to the task force.
   To date, no members of Congress have been named to the panel.
Some members had criticized the proposal as offering more
bureaucracy, rather than concrete steps to battle the problem.
   Meese, however, said congressional leaders emphasized the need
to move quickly and there will be further discussions in the next
few days.
   Meese also told reporters there is ``no softening whatsoever''
of the Reagan administration's ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy,
despite modifications under which the Coast Guard will be more
cautious about seizing boats outside the 12-mile limit.
   Under the administration's zero tolerance policy, law
enforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use, no
matter how small the amount.
   With the new changes, however, vessels outside the 12-mile limit
found to contain drugs will be seized only when there is evidence
of intent to smuggle them into the United States.
   ``There have been some operational refinements, but the policy
remains the same,'' Meese said.
   ``Zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside and
outside the 12-mile limit,'' Meese said. But the attorney general
acknowledged that federal law ``outside 12 miles does relate to
quantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in or
smuggle.''
   One idea that has been jettisoned by the Cabinet-level drug
policy board, according to Meese, is the proposal by the U.S.
Customs Service to shoot down planes carrying drug smugglers.
   In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, Customs
Commissioner William Von Raab declined to discuss specific
anti-drug proposals Customs has made to the drug policy board, but
did call for an all-out fight against drugs.
   ``You must treat it like a war _ total mobilization, total
commitment,'' he told the newspaper. ``When you fight a war, every
man, woman and child should be mobilized to that effort.''

<HEAD>Length of Hospital Stays Declines Since 1980</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The length of the average hospital stay has
dropped since 1980, creating both real and ``false'' savings, a
researcher for the Department of Health and Human Services says.
   The average number of days patients spent in hospitals declined
from 11 percent to 15 percent in the early 1980s, said Dean Farley,
deputy research manager of the Hospital Studies Program in the
National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care
Technology Assessment.
   Although the decline has reduced health care costs for
individuals, the government and insurers, ``in a sense there's a
false sense of savings,'' he said Tuesday.
   ``While patients are staying a shorter period in the hospitals
they are going elsewhere and recuperating,'' he said.
   ``Hospitals are reducing their costs,'' he said. ``Insurers and
the government are saving money, but patients still need nursing
care'' and they usually get it from family members, he said.
   The average hospital stay declined from 7.35 days in 1980 to
5.71 days in 1985, according to The New York Times, which reported
on the findings in today's editions.
   Farley said the decline has occurred even though hospitals are
tending to admit patients who are sicker and who therefore stay
longer. But for some specific medical conditions the length of stay
has been shortened, he said.
   He cited the example of women who used to be admitted to
hospitals for stays of three to five days for normal delivery of
babies now being discharged one or two days after delivery.
   ``The decline has been very substantial and what has happened is
that people (who once were admitted for) relatively short stays
aren't getting into the hospitals,'' Farley said. Instead, he said,
they are treated as outpatients.
   He said hospitals reacted to policies put in place by insurers
and public agencies that believed hospital usage was excessive, but
he said the decline now presents a problem of excess capacity.
   A report by the Hospital Studies Program attributed the decline
in hospital stays to several factors, he said. They include changes
in reimbursement by government insurance programs like Medicare, a
shift toward outpatient care, increased use of second opinions,
changes in the ways hospitals are competing for patients, growth in
health maintenance organizations and other prepaid insurance and
``selective contracting'' by insurers who shop around among
hospitals on the basis of costs.
   He said the decline may be contributing to some hospital
closings. ``It's not unusual to have them operating at 50 (percent)
to 60 percent on average,'' Farley said.
   He said hospitals face the challenge of what to do with the
excess space. ``The state of Maryland was actively discussing about
a year and a half to two years ago how to eliminate 20 percent of
the hospital beds in the state,'' he said. ``I think those kinds of
discussions are taking place all over the country.''
   But Farley said the decline is leveling off.
   ``Lengths of stay have fallen as much as they are going to for a
while but there are some questions in terms of caseloads and the
kinds of patients that they are going to treat,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett says
the legalization of drugs would amount to an admission that
protecting young people is too much trouble.
   ``We are hearing this cry not because Americans want to accept
the costs of drug use but because some are afraid we cannot win
this fight and that the cost of maintaining the war against drugs
has become too great,'' Bennett told a convention of drug
counselors Tuesday.
   He called talk of legalizing drugs ``a new development that may
pull the rug out from under our efforts'' to stop drugs.
   ``Many of those calling for legalization point to the example of
alcohol consumption, as if legalized cocaine, for example, would be
no worse,'' Bennett said. ``That is not the point. ... Legalizing
drugs, even if such legalization were designed to prevent access to
those substances by young people, would almost certainly instead
expand it.''
   He said the war against drugs has been difficult, but that he
can't believe society is ready to say: ``It's too much trouble to
protect our young people from drugs. The use of the military would
cause some difficulties; more law enforcement would mean spending
more; sound education is too much of a burden; it's just too much
trouble for us adults to fulfill our basic responsibilities, so
let's open it up and let our kids take their chances.''
   Bennett spoke at the second annual conference on drug-free
schools.
   ``No videotape, no matter how useful, and no curricular package,
no matter how well conceived, can substitute for the action and
example of educators, parents and other adults in the community who
teach young people the lesson that drug use is wrong,'' he said.
   ``Schools need clear policies against the use and sale of drugs.
The most effective policies call for suspension of students caught
using drugs and harsher penalties for those who sell drugs. ... In
order to prevent drug use form expanding, a user must be treated
firmly, so that he cannot involve non-users and so that his own
drug use ceases.''

<HEAD>Plant Closing Fight Goes Back 15 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unions have been trying unsuccessfully
for 15 years to require businesses to give employees notice of
upcoming plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   President Reagan's veto of the trade bill on Tuesday is just the
latest chapter in a tale that dates back to December 1973, when
then-Sen. Walter F. Mondale, D-Minn., offered the first version of
plant closing legislation.
   Mondale offered the measure after a Minneapolis plant closing
that put 1,200 employees on the street on short notice with a
seriously underfunded pension plan. Import competition was not the
problem. The company was moving its operations to Iowa.
   Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., introduced a similar measure in the
House a few months later, citing similar problems in his district.
   Since then, labor supporters of the concept and business groups
that oppose it have butted heads with few results. The U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association
of Manufacturers contend the plant-closing provisions would tie
management's hands and represent a first step in the
``Europeanization'' of U.S. industry and could bring the heavy
jobless levels that afflict some European economies.
   Proponents scoff at such claims as pure scare talk. They point
to West German and Japanese plant-closings laws already on the
books and note that companies there are outpacing U.S. rivals in
the competitiveness race. They also cite studies by the General
Accounting Office and the Bureau of Labor Statistics which show
that about half of American workers who are laid off get a week's
notice or less.
   ``Advance notice helps workers because it warns them that their
jobs are in danger before they find themselves out of work and on
the street,'' says one major supporter, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.
   The plant closing provision in the trade bill is one of hundreds
of features primarily aimed at turning around the nation's trade
deficit. But it has come to overshadow the other provisions amid
increasingly stern warnings from Reagan that it would guarantee a
veto of the entire bill.
   The provision is simple enough. It would require any company
with 100 employees or more to give 60 days notice of impending
plant closings or layoffs affecting at least 100 workers. There are
exceptions for firms in serious financial difficulties.
   Like supporters of the measure, Reagan says plant-closings
notification are ``the humane thing to do.''
   ``I support voluntarily giving workers and communities as much
advance warning as possible when a layoff or closing becomes
necessary. ... It is the humane thing to do,'' he said in his veto
message to Congress.
   ``But I object to the idea that the federal government would
arbitrarily mandate, for all conditions and under all
circumstances, exactly when and in what form that notification
should take place,'' Reagan said.
   ``There are many circumstances under which such mandatory
notification would actually force a faltering business to close _
by driving away creditors, suppliers, customers, and in the process
destroying jobs.''
   He cited the experience of the Caterpillar Co. in the early
1980s, which, he said, had to use layoffs and temporary plant
closings to respond to competitive developments.
   ``As one executive of that company stated, they did not have the
luxury then, nor do they now, of knowing with certainty what
business conditions would be like 60 days in the future,'' Reagan
said. ``Without the ability to be agile and responsive, they might
have closed their doors permanently.''

<HEAD>Jackson Calls On Superpowers To Consider Non-Military Solutions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, on the eve of
President Reagan's departure for the superpower summit, called on
the president and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to look beyond
military solutions to the world's problems.
   ``The president goes to Moscow, frustrated in Nicaragua. The
general secretary receives him, defeated in Afghanistan,'' the
Democratic presidential contender told a World Affairs Council
luncheon here Tuesday. ``The most powerful nations of the world
confounded in seeking to control poor small nations on or near
their borders.''
   ``After a certain point, there is less and less relationship
between military prowess and the ability to achieve political
objectives,'' Jackson told the group.
   Reagan was leaving this morning for Helsinki, where he will
remain until he flies to Moscow on Sunday for the start of the May
29-June 2 summit.
   Jackson said he would adopt a no-first-use policy on nuclear
weapons and conduct talks with the Soviet Union on bilateral
reductions of conventional forces in Europe.
   And he called for U.S.-Soviet cooperation in tackling the
problems of hunger and poverty around the globe.
   He noted Gorbachev's proposal that the superpowers work together
on an exploration of Mars, and suggested that Reagan reciprocate
``by suggesting a joint project to eradicate disease in the Third
World.''
   In his speech, Jackson also urged an end to the military buildup
Reagan has presided over.
   ``After the largest military buildup in our history, we must
change our course or lose our way,'' Jackson said. Earlier this
week, he released a five-year budget plan that called for a freeze
in military spending.
   ``Invest that money to educate our children, provide health care
to our parents, and protect our environment. This is not an act of
charity; it is a necessary part of defending our real security,''
he said.
   Later, Jackson appeared at an anti-apartheid rally outside the
South African consulate. He repeated his call for South Africa to
be designated a terrorist state, and said he would urge that the
proposal be made part of the Democratic Party platform.
   ``We have a moral obligation to put South Africa in the loop of
terror, to free people from this tyranny and gain our moral
authority in this world,'' he said.
   Jackson also hinted that his Democratic rival, front-runner
Michael Dukakis, has not taken a sufficient interest in the issue.
   ``He is not very conversant on our options in South Africa,''
Jackson said of the Massachusetts governor. ``When we talk about it
in more detail, Mr. Dukakis will see it as a terrorist state.''

<HEAD>Signs That Chemotherapy May Help Control Lung Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors reported finding the first tentative
evidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer,
the nation's leading cancer killer.
   Four studies presented at a medical conference produce at least
a hint that platinum-based drugs, combined with radiation and
sometimes surgery, may help prolong patients' survival.
   None of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lung
cancer, but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a disease
in which survival is measured in months, rather than years.
   ``There is no effective therapy for the vast majority of
patients,'' said Dr. Robert Capizzi of Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   He said this makes the latest research, presented Tuesday at the
annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,
potentially important.
   ``There is the possibility that drugs may, for some subset of
patients, have important effects,'' he said. ``We don't have a
prescription to be offered to the masses. We have important new
leads for controlled clinical trials.''
   About 150,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year.
The four studies were conducted on people with non-small cell lung
cancer, which accounts for about three-quarters of all cases.
   The most encouraging results were presented by Dr. Robert O.
Dillman of the Scripps Clinic of San Diego.
   Like the other studies, his was conducted on people whose cancer
was too extensive to be removed surgically but had not spread
beyond the chest. Typically, such people are treated with
radiation, which slows but does not stop the disease.
   He treated 240 patients with radiation and chemotherapy or with
radiation alone.
   He estimated that half of the patients receiving the combination
would still be alive after one year, compared with one-third of
those who got only radiation.
   ``Our study is the first to show that chemotherapy may help at
all in non-small cell lung cancer,'' Dillman said.
   While the treatment may represent an advance, he said, ``this is
not going to be enough. More clinical trials will be needed to
improve survival in this disease.''
   Dr. Roscoe Morton the North Central Cancer Treatment Group in
Rochester, Minn., conducted a similar study using different
chemotherapy drugs. However, in this attempt, the drugs did not
help people live longer.
   ``We were not able to influence the outcomes by chemotherapy in
addition to radiation,'' he said.
   The other studies used chemotherapy plus radiation to shrink
tumors so they could be removed surgically.
   In one, directed by Dr. Gary M. Strauss of St. Vincent Hospital
in Worcester, Mass., doctors were able to completely remove tumors
from 10 of 41 patients treated.
   He said the patients' median survival is 17 months, and ``there
is a suggestion that this approach might be associated with longer
survival.''
   A smiliar study was conducted by Dr. Paul L. Weiden and
colleagues at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle on 69
patients. He said there was no clear evidence that patients there
did better.
   ``The median survival of all patients is about 11 months, which
is comparable to what would happen with radiation alone,'' Weiden
said. ``We don't have evidence that all patients would benefit by
this treatment. It would appear to be a start to trying to improve
the treatment.''

<HEAD>Small Cracks Found in Some Older Boeing 737s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
preparing a formal regulation that could require the metal skin of
older Boeing 737s to be strengthened and reinforced, the agency's
administrator, Allen McArtor, says.
   The proposed regulation is expected to be formally announced
within a week.
   McArtor's comments on Tuesday came in the wake of last month's
in-flight breakup of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737. A flight
attendant was swept to her death when a 20-foot section of the
plane tore away. The pilots managed to bring the aircraft to a safe
landing, but 61 people were injured.
   The Aloha plane was 19 years old and had made nearly 89,000
landings.
   FAA officials also reported on Tuesday that a special inspection
of 96 older Boeing 737s, begun after that accident, found small
cracks in one of every nine aircraft but none of a magnitude that
they are cause for alarm.
   Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for
aviation standards, said that of the 96 planes inspected under the
order, 10 were found to have some cracks, the largest of which was
one-fourth of an inch. He said none of the cracks should be
considered ``alarming.''
   Investigators believe that a 20-foot section of the forward
cabin wall and roof tore away from the Aloha Boeing 737 during
April 28 flight because of a structural failure stemming from
cracking and corrosion.
   A week after the incident, the FAA directed that all Boeing 737s
with 30,000 or more landings undergo a special visual inspection
and those with more than 50,000 landings be subject to additional
inspections using high-frequency electronic equipment.
   According to the Boeing Co., there are 373 of the 737s worldwide
with 30,000 or more landings, 212 of which operate in the United
States and are subject to the FAA-required inspections.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has been
summoned before the legislature to report on negotiations with U.S.
officials over the nation's lengthy political crisis.
   The move on Tuesday by the pro-Noriega Legislative Assembly
would allow Panama's military leader to present his position
without appearing to take the initiative in divulging details of
the talks.
   By a 39-7 vote with five abstentions, the 67-member body
summoned Noriega to appear before it within 48 hours. The chief of
Panama's 15,000-strong Defense Forces and the nation's de facto
leader, did not immediately respond.
   A similar move failed in the assembly on Monday when 27 of 47
legislators present voted for it. Passage required a two-thirds
majority of those present.
   The United States has imposed a wide array of economic sanctions
on Panama in an effort to force the ouster of Noriega, who was
indicted in February on federal drug smuggling charges in Florida.
   Reagan administration officials want Noriega to resign his post
and leave the country at least temporarily.
   If Noriega appears before the legislature, he will be asked what
American negotiators have proposed, what Panamanian negotiators are
trying to achieve, and why the United States is taking part in the
talks if it does not recognize the Noriega-controlled government of
President Manuel Solis Palma.
   The White House's chief negotiator, Michael G. Kozak, has been
meeting with Noriega representatives for nearly a month to try to
resolve the crisis. He returned to Panama on Monday after a brief
trip to Washington.
   While a deal has been reported near on several occasions by
Reagan administration sources, Noriega has said in several recent
appearances that he will not leave unless American economic
sanctions are lifted and U.S. ``aggression'' ends.
   About 2,000 American troops have been sent to Panama in recent
weeks to back up the 10,000 soldiers already here assigned to
protect the Panama Canal.
   Noriega also has said the United States must ``respect'' the
presidency of Solis Palma, who took over the presidency Feb. 26
after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega and was
deposed by the general's supporters.
   Delvalle, recognized by the United States as the legitimate
president of Panama, is in hiding in Panama. There is a warrant out
for his arrest.
   Romulo Escobar Betancourt, president of the pro-military
Revolutionary Democratic Party, told local television stations on
Tuesday that the crisis would be resolved if the United States
lifts the sanctions.
   ``In five minutes,'' he said, ``the problem would be settled.''
   Betancourt, who has represented Noriega in the talks with the
United States, also said: ``We have totally rejected the fact that
Noriega has to leave the country.''
   Noriega has denied the U.S. drug smuggling charges, which he
contends are a political ploy to replace him with a less
nationalistic leader who might tolerate a prolonged American
military presence.
   President Reagan reportedly is considering dropping the
indictments if it would lead to Noriega's departure from power, a
position that has sharply divided his administration.

<HEAD>Prostitute Says Swaggart Had Sex With Her</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prostitute claims she and television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart had sexual intercourse and he wanted her
9-year-old daughter to watch sex acts but she refused, Penthouse
magazine reports.
   The article in the July issue is the first to report that
Swaggart engaged in sexual intercourse during any of the alleged
sexual encounters that led to his removal from the pulpit by the
Assemblies of God church April 8.
   In previous reports, the prostitute, Debra Murphree, said
Swaggart paid her to perform lewd acts while he watched in a New
Orleans area motel last year.
   Swaggart, head of the Baton Rouge-based Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries, stopped preaching for three months but returned to the
pulpit Sunday without credentials from the Assemblies, the nation's
largest Pentecostal denomination.
   The Penthouse interview is accompanied by explicit photos in
which Murphree demonstrates the acts she said Swaggart asked her to
perform.
   She said she had at least 20 encounters with him during a
one-year period.
   The issue containing the article is scheduled to go on sale in
June, but some copies were sold here Tuesday.
   Swaggart has never admitted a sexual encounter, but said from
the pulpit Feb. 1 that he was guilty of a sin against his family.
   William Treeby, an attorney for the ministries, refused to
comment on the Penthouse article.
   ``We will have no comment about that ever,'' Treeby said.
   In April, The National Enquirer supermarket tabloid decided not
to use an interview with Murphree after she failed a lie detector
test about her allegations. She blamed the polygraph results on her
use of cocaine the day before the test was administered.
   Penthouse planned to pay the 28-year-old Murphree for the
interview and pictures, but Leslie Jay, the magazine's director of
public relations, would not disclose the amount.
   In the article, Murphree claimed that she and Swaggart had brief
sexual intercourse once, and that she performed oral sex on
Swaggart more than once.
   She said Swaggart was unwilling most times to pay her the going
rate of ``$30 or $40'' for oral sex.
   ``God, what a freak! Kinky! Here he is up there preaching for
all this money, and when I see him, he's kinky and cheap, too,''
she said.
   She said she refused Swaggart's request that she have her
9-year-old daughter watch sex acts.
   ``I said, `You can do whatever turns you on but don't ever
mention my daughter again,' '' the magazine quoted her as saying.
   Murphree has three children living with her parents in Indiana.
She has an arrest record in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana,
mainly involving prostitution charges.

   The government today expressed relief after
President Reagan vetoed an omnibus trade bill that provides for
sanctions against a Japanese company and countries who violate
international trade agreements.
   Japan's relief was qualified, however, by a vote overriding the
veto in the U.S. House of Representatives and the reasons behind
Reagan's veto.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, speaking to reporters at his
official residence, welcomed the veto. ``Concern now is primarily
on domestic issues in the United States,'' Takeshita said. ``When
the negotiations (between Reagan and Congress) begin, the issues
most affecting Japan will be brought out.''
   Japan's minister of international trade and industry, Hajime
Tamura, told a news conference: ``Our ministry has in the past
requested efforts from the United States government to see that the
trade bill would not be enacted, and we welcome President Reagan's
veto.''
   Opposition to the bill in Japan stems mainly from provisions
requiring retaliation against violations of international trade
pacts and other ``unjustifiable'' practices.
   If enacted, the bill would transfer from the president to the
U.S. trade representative the authority to decide what unfair trade
practices another country is engaged in and what, if any,
retaliatory measures to impose.
   A provision imposing sanctions against Toshiba Corp. and one of
its subsidiaries, Toshiba Machine Co., for the subsidiary's sales
of sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union also concerns Japan.
   Reagan's veto message made no mention of the Toshiba sanctions.
The message focused on curbs on exports of Alaskan oil and a
mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance
warning of closures or layoffs.
   Toshiba Machine Corp. sold the Soviets milling machines that
could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more
difficult to detect. The sales violated international rules
regulating trade between the West and communist countries.
   Tamura said he hopes Congress will support Reagan and that the
bill will not pass. ``But for us foreigners it is very hard to say
what will happen in the United States,'' he added.
   The House overrode the veto with a margin well above the
two-thirds majority required, but it was thought unlikely that the
Senate would go along when it considers the override after next
week's Memorial Day recess.

   Thieves beheaded a fiberglass
hippopotamus at a miniature golf course after an unsuccessful try
at taking a 600-pound golf course whale, police said.
   ``It's the time of year we normally see a lot of
end-of-the-school-year pranks,'' said Knox County Sheriff's

   He said the thieves apparently gave up trying to lug the
fiberglass whale onto a vehicle after dragging it part way off the
course, still under construction, sometime Friday or Saturday. The
thieves then took the 200-pound hippo head, he said.
   Gray said he figures the hippo head will surface sometime soon.
   ``There's not too many places you can hide a 4-foot-by-6-foot
hippopotamus head. It's probably sitting in somebody's garage right
now,'' he said.

   Montana's race for governor, rocked by the
sudden withdrawal of the incumbent and the unexpected death of his
chief opponent, has left the state with a jumble of more candidates
than it has seen in 16 years.
   The remaining candidates in the June 7 primary include Montana's
attorney general, who is trying to overcome a drunken-driving
conviction; a former governor; a former state Supreme Court
justice; three past and present legislators; a drug
addict-turned-preacher and a tax protester.
   Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden's decision last summer not to seek
a third term, saying he wanted concentrate more on his farm and
family, opened doors for candidates who had been unwilling to take
on the popular incumbent.
   Then, in early April, a plane crash killed the Republican
front-runner, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, leaving his
supporters with a dilemma over which of the two remaining GOP
contenders to back.
   The common thread running through the eight-man campaign for
governor, the most crowded since 1972, has been economic
development, with the candidates offering ideas for infusing new
life into Montana's lackluster economy.
   The two Republican candidates, former state Sen. Stan Stephens
and state Rep. Cal Winslow, are vying for the chance to end the
Democratic Party's 20-year reign in the governor's chair.
   Both men have legislative backgrounds; Stephens has logged 16
years in the Senate and Winslow has served eight years in House.
But the similarities end there.
   Stephens, 58, has attracted support from the mainstream of the
state Republican Party, collecting support from former party
leaders and longtime GOP officeholders. He boasts of his experience
in Senate leadership positions and as a successful businessman from
northern Montana.
   Winslow, 38, has appealed to the younger elements of the
Republican Party, portraying himself as a conduit for attracting
new business to the state.
   The six Democratic candidates include three serious contenders.
   Thomas Judge, who was governor from 1973 to 1981, is attempting
a comeback after losing in the 1980 Democratic primary to
Schwinden. The 53-year-old investment adviser has built his
campaign on experience and an elaborate economic development plan.
   ``I won't need four years of on-the-job training,'' he has said,
boasting of the state's lucrative economy during his two terms as
governor.
   Attorney General Mike Greely, 48, overcame the stigma of a 1986
drunken-driving conviction to enter the race. He's called for a
more aggressive program for marketing Montana products elsewhere.
   Frank Morrison Jr., who resigned as a state Supreme Court
justice last year to run, has emerged as the candidate most
vehemently opposed to a retail sales tax.
   Seen as the most liberal of the Democrats, the 50-year-old
Morrison has political roots in Nebraska, where his father was a
three-term governor.
   The other Democratic candidates are Ted Neuman, a little-known
state senator and farmer; Emmett ``Curly'' Thornton, a traveling
evangelist who preaches on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse
based on his own past addictions; and Martin ``Red'' Beckman, a tax
protester and author.

<HEAD>Harvard Challenges Union Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University has filed objections
with the National Labor Relations Board about a union vote by
white-collar workers, charging that organizers used illegal tactics
to gain a slim victory.
   The university action Tuesday was ordered by Harvard President
Derek Bok. Harvard officials claimed workers were ``intimidated or
coerced'' as they voted May 17 in favor of unionizing.
   A union officer said Harvard was ``stretching it'' with the
charges and had no evidence to prove the claim.
   Harvard's 3,300 clerical and technical staff members voted by a
44-vote majority to make the Harvard Union of Clerical and
Technical Workers their negotiating body. The Ivy League school
fought the union drive with flyers, in-house meetings with
supervisors and public statements.
   The union drive was closely watched by national labor leaders as
a benchmark for organizing white-collar workers. Harvard's prestige
and the bitterness of the fight between the university and the
union drew national media attention.
   ``Harvard worked very hard to ensure that staff members would be
permitted to vote on May 17 in a fair and lawful process, without
being intimidated or coerced,'' said Anne Taylor, who coordinated
Harvard's response to the union drive. ``There is some evidence
that the union did not share this principle.''
   Taylor said 41 of those who voted for the union were ineligible
to vote because of their jobs status. As a result, she said, the
actual margin could have been as small as three votes.
   Harvard charged that union representatives maintained lists of
voters, interrogated workers at the polls, campaigned near polling
places, escorted workers to voting places and pressured union
opponents not to vote.
   Harvard's filing of the NLRB claim drew a rebuke from Gerald W.
McEntee, national president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, to which the Harvard union belongs.
   He called the charges ``an insult to the thousands of university
employees who participated in this free and open election and an
insult to the entire labor movement. Harvard has flunked its
fairness report card.''
   Chief union organizer Kristine Rondeau questioned the charge
that she and others intimidated workers. ``I don't think that I
could intimidate a fly,'' Rondeau said. ``It's really stretching
it.''
   Rondeau said the university issued a questionnaire to the more
than 3,300 workers Tuesday asking whether they noticed any pressure
by the union on election day. She denied that the union pressured
anyone.
   Robert Garner, assistant regional director for the NLRB, said
the board's policy has been to conduct union elections in
``laboratory conditions,'' as free from pressure as possible.
   The NLRB could take from a month to more than a year to review
Harvard's charges, he said.
   ``From the union's standpoint, the worst that could happen is
that they have to run the election over again,'' Garner said.

<HEAD>Suit Filed In Effort To Stop Obscenity Prosecutions</HEAD>

   A Connecticut-based operator of a mail-order
pornography business is suing the Justice Department to stop
prosecuting him on obscenity charges in four states.
   Avram Freedberg, owner of Consumer's Marketing Group Ltd. of
Stamford Conn., filed the suit Tuesday to prevent the Justice
Department's national obscenity enforcement unit from bringing the
charges in federal courts in Mississippi, Indiana, Utah and
Delaware.
   He asked a federal judge to issue an temporary restraining order
to halt the prosecutions.
   The suit charges that the effort to prosecute Freedberg, his
wife, Rhoda, and others in the four jurisdictions is merely a
campaign to harass the firm and drive it out of business by forcing
it to incur large legal fees.
   The suit said government prosecutors ``simply disapprove of the
content of plaintiff's promotional materials, magazines, and
videotapes, and are unconstitutionally intimidating plaintiffs with
multiple (simultaneous or consecutive) obscenity prosecutions.''

   An advocacy group accuses federal regulators
of permitting lead concentrations in fresh Florida grapefruit juice
20 times that allowed in drinking water.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is closing its eyes to the
extreme use of lead arsenate, a chemical used to accelerate the
ripening of grapefruit, the National Coalition Against the Misuse
of Pesticides, said Tuesday.
   The last federal license to sell lead arsenate was surrendered
earlier this year by the manufacturer, Micro-Flo Co. of Lakeland,
Fla., rather than conduct more tests that EPA said were needed for
its 10-year-old review of arsenic-based pesticides.
   In return for surrendering the license, the company was
permitted to sell remaining inventories. Up to 100,000 pounds per
year have been used recently, enabling growers to earn almost $10
million a year in extra profits by sending fruit to market early,
according to EPA estimates.
   The coalition says there is enough lead arsenate in Florida
distribution channels to serve growers for another two years.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Restrict Use Of Boat-Hull Paint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has approved legislation to restrict
the use of a popular boat-hull paint that is effective against
marine organisms like barnacles but which poses environmental risks.
   The bill, approved by voice vote in the House on Tuesday, would
ban the use of paints containing organic tin additives on
non-aluminum hull vessels less than 82 feet long. The most widely
used additive is tributyltin, or TBT.
   The measure would permit continued use of such paints on large
vessels and those with aluminum hulls so long as the organic tin
compounds are not released into the water at more than 4 micrograms
per square centimeter a day.
   Paints with organic tin are much more effective against
barnacles and marine algae than copper-based paints, meaning lower
maintenance costs for boat owners. But testimony in the House said
those paints can remain toxic for up to six months when released
into the water.

   At least 20,000 people fled in panic
when a 40-foot-tall kerosene tank caught fire at an oil tank farm
in this northern city, threatening adjacent tanks. It was 10 hours
before residents could return home.
   No serious injuries were reported in Tuesday's blaze at the
storage facility operated by the government oil monopoly Pemex in a
residential area.
   Authorities said some firefighters suffered minor burns in the
eight hours it took for them to bring the inferno under control.
   About 900,000 gallons of kerosene were in the steel tank when it
ignited in an explosion at about 10:10 a.m. (12:10 p.m. EDT).
   The government news agency Notimex said area residents had been
protesting the tank farm's presence and the tanks were to have been
relocated months ago, but new facilities have not been completed.
   The conflagration threatened 14 other tanks on the farm that
were filled with millions of gallons of gasoline. Fire and smoke
spiraled more than 150 feet above the plant.
   Fearing the worst, authorities evacuated people living around
the plant.
   One estimate said as many as 200,000 people fled their homes.
   ``There were all kinds of accidents in the road. The whole city
was running (away from the site),'' said Luis Alonso Hernandez, 26,
who works at the plant. ``You could see the flames and black smoke
from miles away.''
   Chihuahua, 230 miles south of El Paso, Texas, has 550,000
residents and is the capital of Chihuahua, the largest of Mexico's
31 states.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but company
officials said maintenance work was going on at the time of the
explosion.
   ``What we do know is that two men were soldering to repair a
line at the base of the tank and that the top part exploded,'' said
Francisco Cortez Coronado, a plant spokesman.
   ``There was an explosion but it was very muffled, and then the
fire started,'' said plant foreman Arturo Rubio.
   Pemex workers and firefighters used water and foam to douse the
blaze and cool off a nearby gasoline tank scorched by the flames.
   ``The danger lasted about five hours,'' Rubio said. ``It was a
question of cooling off the other tank.''
   Notimex said four tanks were ``very close'' to the burning tank.
   It quoted the local fire chief as saying soldiers, police and
volunteers evacuated more than 100,000 people from a two-mile
radius around the plant.
   Notimex later gave its own estimate of 200,000 people evacuated
and said hundreds of soldiers and rescue workers helped in the
effort.
   Reporters at the newspaper Novedades de Chihuahua placed the
number of evacuees at 20,000.
   City police spokesman Lucia Perez said it could only be
estimated that ``several thousands'' of residents were evacuated
from the nearby working-class and middle-class neighborhoods.
   Pemex officials at the site said the tank that burned had a
capacity of 1.2 million gallons and was three-fourths full. The
other tanks on the farm contained regular and premium gasoline.
   Red Cross radio dispatcher Olga Rojo said efforts to control the
blaze were initially hampered by a scarcity of water. Much of
northern Mexico is suffering from drought this season.
   On Nov. 19, 1984, more than 500 people were killed at an
explosion of storage tanks owned by Pemex in San Juan Ixhuatepec, a
working class neighborhood on the northern outskirts of Mexico City.
   The disaster led to heated debate about locating oil and
industrial complexes near residential neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Robertson Supporters To Boycott N.C. Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson supporters, accusing party
regulars in North Carolina of plotting against them, are
threatening a boycott of next week's state Republican convention.
   ``By not participating in a process designed to abuse our
delegates, we believe we are today making a positive protest that
we hope will help deter similar behavior in the future,'' Sue
Wyatt, the state chairman of Robertson's organization, said Tuesday.
   Ms. Wyatt accused state GOP Chairman Jack Hawke of stacking key
committees and levying a fee of up to $150 for convention delegates
in an alleged effort to deter Robertson supporters from attending.
   Although Robertson got less than 10 percent of the vote in the
March 8 presidential primary, his supporters packed many precinct
and county conventions _ often comprising a majority.
   Bush supporters say state law gives their candidate a right to
his choice of at least 29 of North Carolina's 54 national GOP
convention delegates, based on his victory in the primary. They say
Dole, who finished second, won the other 25 delegates, who would be
uncommitted because he quit the race.

<HEAD>Jackson Sets TV Campaign for California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson plans to spend between $500,000
and $750,000 on television commercials starting next week in
delegate-rich California, while avoiding TV advertising in New
Jersey.
   Voters in California, New Jersey and two other states wind up
the long Democratic primary season on June 7.
   Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager said Tuesday the
commercials will start May 31, one week before the primary election
Jackson has been campaigning hard to win.
   The Jackson campaign, which has improved its fund-raising to a
$4-million-a-month operation, is paying staff members at offices in
37 of California's 45 congressional districts and thus has other
financial commitments to meet, Austin said.
   The California commercials will start on May 31, one week before
the election.
   In New Jersey, which also holds a primary on June 7, along with
California, Montana and New Mexico, there will be no expenditures
for TV, he said, but the campaign is buying some radio time. The
overall campaign budget in New Jersey is about $250,000, Austin
said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley and Gov.
Terry Branstad have agreed to jointly head George Bush's Iowa
campaign in a move aimed at healing deep rifts in the state's
Republican Party caused by an intense campaign for the Feb. 8
precinct caucuses.
   Grassley was the most prominent Iowa backer of Senate GOP Leader
Bob Dole, and his political organization helped Dole score a
convincing victory in those caucuses. Branstad did not endorse a
candidate during that campaign.
   Bush campaign officials said they plan to announce the
appointments next week at a news conference in Des Moines.
   George Wittgraf, a Cherokee lawyer who headed Bush's caucus
campaign, would say only that Grassley ``will be prominently and
actively involved, together with the governor.''
   Wittgraf, who upset some Bush backers with his strident assaults
on Dole, will run the day-to-day activities of Bush's fall campaign
in the state.

<HEAD>Lady Bing Arrested For Keeping Husband Out Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of former Metropolitan Opera impresario
Sir Rudolf Bing has been arrested a second time after she kept her
husband out late in violation of a court order, police said.
   Carroll Douglass Bing, 48, was charged with violating the court
order of protection and third-degree assault, said Sgt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   She was supposed to have her 86-year-old husband, who suffers
from Alzheimer's disease, back to their apartment by 9 p.m., but
was about two hours late Tuesday, said O'Donnell, who did not know
where the couple had spent the evening.
   ``Then when she did return, she got involved in a dispute with a
40-year-old nurse,'' pushing her against a wall and bruising her
head, he said. The nurse declined medical treatment.
   Security guards at the apartment house called police, he said.
   Lady Bing was arrested May 12 after she allegedly violated the
court order issued three days before by state Judge Carmen
Ciparick. The judge ordered that she stay away from her husband for
six hours a day so nurses can care for him.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to prosecute
her at that time.
   Lady Bing is in a civil court fight with her husband's lawyer,
Paul Goldhamer, who charges that she has abused Bing and has asked
the judge to annul the Bings' 1{-year-old marriage.

<HEAD>Dollar Inactive, Stocks Post Healthy Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed little changed today in trading
against the Japanese yen, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange posted a healthy gain following the overnight advance on
Wall Street.
   After opening the day at 124.20 yen, the dollar climbed slightly
and ended the day at 124.30 yen, up 0.05 yen from Tuesday's finish.
   ``The dollar stayed stable throughout the day, ranging between
124.15 and 124.33 yen in mixed trading,'' said a dealer with a
major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was some dollar-selling by trading houses that pulled the
currency down a little, but it climbed back again on speculative
buying by financial institutions, he said.
   ``There was also apprehensions over possible market intervention
by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar, which prevented
participants to make major moves,'' the dealer said.
   Japan's central bank, however, did not step into the market, he
said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained a small 62.90 points Tuesday, won
130.99 points, or 0.47 percent, to close the day's trading at
27,443.65.
   ``The overnight rise on Wall Street made investors confident,''
said Hiromi Yoneyama of Wako Securities.
   Share prices were firm almost across the board supported by
strong buying mood by institutional, foreign, as well as individual
investors, he said.
   Investors who have been concerned about rising interest rates
and booming inflation in the United States are now less pessimistic
about the future of the U.S. economy, he added.
   Trading was heavy, led by large-capital issues such as steels
and heavy industries, said traders.
   Volume on the first section trading wa estimated at 1.5 billion
shares, up from 1.1 billion shares Tuesday.
   Other than large-capital issues, shipbuildings, automobiles,
chemicals, machineries and real estates were higher. Certain
electricals and precision machineries lost ground.

<HEAD>Voter Decide Congressional Primaries In Kentucky, Idaho</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Democratic congressmen were expected to sail to victory in
November after walloping opponents in Kentucky primaries, one of
them dubbed the nation's nastiest, as Idaho held contests in its
two congressional districts.
   In Kentucky's 1st District, incumbent Rep. Carroll Hubbard
traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct with
challenger Lacey T. Smith in perhaps the most heated primary on the
ballot Tuesday.
   ``The people have not only said yes to Carroll Hubbard, but they
have said no, a loud no, to the type of campaigning that we've seen
in this race,'' the 50-year-old congressman said after receiving 73
percent of the vote in the most bitterly contested race.
   With all but four of the district's 491 precincts reporting
unofficial returns, Hubbard received 62,251 votes to 22,828 votes,
or 27 percent, for Smith, a 48-year-old businessman who moved from
Florida to seek Hubbard's seat.
   Hubbard called Smith a carpetbagger and questioned his
dedication to his recently acquired Baptist faith. Smith accused
Hubbard of incompetence and improperly investigating a loan Smith
had received.
   Roll Call, a Washington weekly that calls itself ``the newspaper
of the Congress,'' had labeled the campaign ``the nastiest in the
country.''
   The two other incumbent Democratic congressmen facing primary
opposition, William H. Natcher in the 2nd District and Romano
Mazzoli in the 3rd District, also won easy renomination.
   In the state's 3rd District, which covers Louisville, nine-term
incumbent Mazzoli defeated Jeffrey Hutter, a Humana Inc. health
services executive and former television news reporter, after a
campaign in which Hutter claimed that Mazzoli had done little for
the district despite his seniority.
   Mazzoli received 31,288 votes, or 61 percent, to 20,207 votes,
or 39 percent, for Hutter with all 350 precincts reporting
unofficial results. Former U.S. Attorney Philip Dunnagan easily won
the Republican nomination against two perennial candidates.
   Rep. William H. Natcher, who has represented the 2nd District
since 1953, defeated Bob Evans, a farmer whom Natcher beat by 79
percent to 21 percent in the primary two years ago.
   With all 414 precincts reporting unofficial returns, Natcher had
26,918 votes, or 76 percent, to 8,319 votes, or 24 percent, for
Evans.
   Republicans selected former assistant U.S. Attorney Philip
Dunnagan to carry their banner in the 3rd District in the fall.
Martin A. Tori of Radcliff was unopposed for the Republican
nomination in the 2nd District.
   In Idaho, state Rep. Jeanne Givens of Coeur d'Alene, a
full-blooded Coeur d'Alene Indian, manufactured a huge victory over
Bonners Ferry attorney Bruce Robinson and Lewiston apartment
manager David Shepherd for the Democratic nomination to face
four-term Republican Congressman Larry Craig in the 1st District.
   With 73 percent of the 418 precincts reporting, Mrs. Givens had
63 percent to Shepherd's 21 percent and Robinson's 16 percent.
   Voters in the conservative 2nd District of southern Idaho gave
former state Sen. Dane Watkins of Idaho Falls the Republican
nomination to challenge two-term Democratic Congressman Richard
Stallings in the fall.
   With 68 percent of the precincts reporting, Watkins had 58
percent and political novice Janet Reid of Idaho Falls had 42
percent.
   In Kentucky, attention centered on the Democratic contests,
whose winners were expected to be heavy favorites in November in
the heavily Democratic districts.
   Hubbard faces independent candidate Charles K. Hatchett in
November. The incumbent had not faced serious opposition in
Kentucky's 1st Congressional District, which covers the state's
westernmost counties, since ousting incumbent Frank Stubblefield in
the 1974 primary.
   Smith, his opponent, admitted that the carpetbagger image hurt
him badly.
   ``I think that he created enough of a question about my
commitment to western Kentucky. I think people just weren't able to
take a chance on it,'' Smith said.

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general said he
will seek contempt-of-court charges against the mother of a black
teen-ager who claims she was abducted and raped by a group of white
men.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams said Tuesday he found it ironic
that dozens of friends, neighbors and acquaintances of Tawana
Brawley will talk to investigators, but that the teen-ager's own
family continues to resist the probe.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, has defied a subpoena to tell a
grand jury investigating the case about her daughter's allegations
of sexual abuse at the hands of six white men. The Brawleys say the
incident was racially motivated.
   ``The strategy of defiance and non-cooperation on the part of
the family and their representatives continues to impede our
investigation from learning the full story of what happened to
Tawana Brawley,'' Abrams said.
   Abrams called the situation ``unfortunate and regrettable,'' and
said the blame must be shared by the Brawleys' representatives,
attorneys Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason, and the Rev. Al
Sharpton.
   Mason and Sharpton have called Abrams and Gov. Mario Cuomo
racists, and insisted that Abrams step aside as special prosecutor
in the case.
   Mrs. Brawley talked about her daughter's case on a New York City
radio station Tuesday at the same time she had been summoned to
appear before the grand jury here.
   ``I could not get any justice, so I went to the black community
and I got all the power that I need to back me to help me to fight
for my daughter,'' said Mrs. Brawley, who was interviewed on
station WLIB with Tawana's stepfather, Ralph King, and the family's
advisers.
   Mason and Maddox said they are eager to explain the reasons for
defying the subpoena. A hearing on the contempt allegation will be
sometime next week, said Abrams' spokesman Timothy Gilles.
   The 16-year-old Wappingers Falls girl was missing for four days
before she was found Nov. 28 in a dazed state with racial epithets
and excrement smeared on her body. She said that white men, one of
them with a badge, had abducted and raped her.
   Miss Brawley has refused to cooperate with investigators. Her
only statements about what happened have come through her family.
   Authorities have not be able to find evidence to corroborate her
story.
   After allegations by attorneys for Miss Brawley that local
investigators could not be impartial, Cuomo assigned the case to
Abrams.
   If found in contempt, Mrs. Brawley could be jailed for up to 30
days or fined $250, Abrams said.

   Despite assurances of better services,
voters in several resort communities decided against forming the
city of Lake Tahoe after casinos helped wage a vigorous advertising
campaign against the move.
   The vote Tuesday was 1,001 against and 802 for the plan. The
issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent, said
Douglas County Clerk Barbara Reed. She said a normal turnout was
35-40 percent.
   The proposed city, with a population of about 6,500, would have
embraced the casino area of Stateline and smaller communities along
about 15 miles of Lake Tahoe's southeastern shore.
   The proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities, although
proponents had argued that the communities, which make up 25
percent of Douglas County's population, do not receive a
proportionate share in services of the 60 percent in tax revenue
they contribute.
   Ron Nino, leader of the opposition, said he was very pleased
with the vote, adding, ``We believed there was going to be a
substantial tax increase. People will pay more for more but we
didn't see where there was going to be more. We saw the same or
less.''
   The opposition received financial support from the Stateline
casinos, whose tax burden Nino said would rise by at least $300,000
yearly under a city government.
   ``The tax scare did it,'' admitted Bill Bigham, a leader of the
movement to create the city. ``I think that did us in, perhaps
along with mixing it with the Highway Patrol.'' Opponents also
argued there would be fewer or no state trooper patrols in the area
if the city was created.
   ``The ads that came out in the paper were rather overwhelming,''
Bigham said. ``While we had some good editorials in the paper, and
some people sponsored their own ads for the city, we just didn't
have the money to spend on it that the opposition did.''
   Commissioners of Douglas County, which would lose about $1.8
million in yearly tax revenue to the city, mostly from the big
Stateline casinos, had advised voters to reject the plan.
   Communities in California, on the western side of the lake, also
had complained about the plan, saying the name Lake Tahoe would
create confusion between the lake and the city.

   Thunderstorms boomed over Florida today after unleashing
tornadoes and high winds that threw a porch onto a pickup truck,
cut power to thousands and injured six passengers aboard a
jetliner. In Atlanta, lightning killed a man.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over southeast Georgia and along
the Carolina coast, and extended from southern New England to
eastern Kentucky and the southern Appalachians.
   Thunderstorms and showers also dampened eastern New Mexico and
northwest Texas. Showers and a few thunderstorms fell over the
northern High Plains.
   Frost and freeze advisories were issued for sections of Michigan
and Wisconsin.
   More than half a dozen tornadoes were reported during Tuesday's
storms in Florida. Near Hilliard, a twister threw the back porch of
a home onto a truck in the front yard.
   High winds and heavy rain buffeted a Braniff Airlines jetliner
approaching Orlando International Airport at 13,000 feet, slightly
injuring four of the 55 passengers and two flight attendants. The
BAC-111, two-engine aircraft landed safely.
   Storms also knocked out power to 5,000 customers in Brevard
County.
   On Florida's Gulf Coast, lighting touched off six brush fires
that charred nearly 200 acres near a residential area and forced
people from their homes.
   In Atlanta, lightning killed a 25-year-old man waiting for a bus
who sought shelter from the storm under a tree, said Sgt. C.A.
Graham, an investigator for the Fulton County medical examiner.
   In North Carolina, thunderstorms unleashed winds recorded at 88
mph in the coastal city of Columbia. Power lines were downed in
Martin County.
   Quarter-size hail was reported in Polk County, Fla., and
marble-size hail fell in Rocky Ford, Colo.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern New England and eastern New York to Florida, and scattered
over western Montana.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 50s and 60s from
New England to the Great Lakes and south through the Ohio Valley,
Virginia and West Virginia; the 60s and 70s along the Pacific
Coast; the 70s from the Carolinas to the Tennessee Valley, from
northern Georgia to northeast Arkansas, in the northern half of the
Mississippi Valley and from the Texas Panhandle to Colorado; near
90 in much of Florida and the southern half of Texas; the 90s to
about 110 in the desert Southwest; and the 80s in the rest of the

   Thousands of evacuated residents waited to
return home today while many others faced commuting headaches as
propane from an overturned tank truck burned for a second day.
   The fire was so intense, and potentially explosive, that
firefighters were prevented from approaching the burning truck
loaded with about 2,500 gallons of propane. Instead, unmanned
pumpers threw water on the blaze.
   Officials estimated that the fire could burn for as long as 30
hours, or until about 3:30 p.m. today, if no explosion occurred.
   About 2,000 families were evacuated from within half a mile of
the accident and taken to a nearby church, said Hank McCann, a
Nassau County police spokesman.
   County police Lt. Willard Krausch said the truck overturned
Tuesday morning on the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway after the
driver experienced a problem with the truck's rear wheels.
   A section of the highway and of another nearby road were closed,
and the Long Island Rail Road was forced to suspend all commuter
rail service on a nearby line.
   About 30,000 rush-hour passengers were expected to be directly
affected this morning by service disruptions on the railroad's
busiest branch, the Babylon line, said a railroad spokesman, Brian
Dolan.
   ``There hasn't been as severe a tie-up on our system in quite a
while,'' said Dolan. ``It's certainly the worst this year.''
   Fire communications supervisor Douglas Wood said the fire
marshal's office and hazardous materials experts were at the scene,
and ambulances were standing by in case of an explosion.
   Propane meets a variety of residential and commercial energy
needs, particularly in areas that are not served by natural gas
pipelines.
   The driver, Roger Vai, 35, of Westbury, who was treated at the
scene for a shoulder cut, was arrested on an outstanding traffic
offense and also charged with driving with a suspended license and
failure to produce a license.
   A trainee who was riding with him escaped before the truck
ignited, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities released from jail six
Americans and four other foreigners charged with violating the
country's territorial waters, but kept them under city arrest until
a court decides their case.
   The group includes three Australians and a Briton and some
members threatened Monday to launch a hunger strike to try to
expedite the proceedings. The 10 were arrested March 22 for
allegedly entering Indonesian waters without a proper permit in the
eastern Sumatra province of Riau, a few miles south of Singapore.
   A local news report quoted one of the Americans as saying the
group was on a scuba diving holiday looking for a sunken wreck when
they were arrested.
   Indonesian newspapers said that in 1986 the crew of a British
vessel, the Ocean Pluto, had recovered $15 million worth of china
and gold bullion from the wreck of a Dutch ship, the Geldermalsen,
that sank in 1752 near where the 10 were found by the authorities.
   Public Prosecutor Halius Hosen said the foreigners were not
charged with illegally hunting for treasure: ``The charge is that
they have entered Indonesian waters and held scientific research
without proper permit.''
   Hosen said by telephone today that the group was released from
jail May 5 in the provincial city of Tanjung Pinang ``but they are
not allowed to leave.''
   He said some of the foreigners denied the charge and some had
threatened to go on a hunger strike after a preliminary court
hearing Monday during which the trial was adjourned until June 2.
   The prosecutor said he did not know whether the protesters had
begun a hunger strike. He also said he had not decided what
punishment to seek for the defendants.
   Hosen refused to link the foreigners' detention with the
Geldermalsen wreck, which was left there by the British divers in
1985.
   The six Americans, all from California, were identified as
Daniel M. Commerford, 38; Robert Alan Lanham, 34; and Bruce Edward
Lanham, 34; Patrick Gilbert Gibson, 47; Clifton Bert Craft, 43; and
James E. Vorus, 46.
   The Australians are Peter John Howes, 30; Martino Paul Kenneth,
40, and Paul Martino, Jr., 17. The Briton is Mark Tomlinson, 26.
   No hometowns were available, and none of the 10 could be reached
for comment.

   The U.S. dollar edged upward today in slow
European trading which exchange dealers said lacked both direction
and volume. Gold prices also rose.
   ``There is nothing interesting in sight,'' said one dealer at a
West German bank in Frankfurt. ``We will keep a narrow range again,
just like yesterday.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed little changed at 124.30 yen, up 0.05 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 124.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8652, cheaper for
buyers than $1.8680 late Tuesday.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$458.35 a troy ounce at midmorning, down from the opening bid of

<TEXT>
   Masked workers spent two days cleaning out
the rat-infested home of a 71-year-old woman who authorities said
allowed more than 20 tons of garbage to pile up for 20 years. But
more work remained.
   ``The odor was so offensive, I couldn't breathe,'' Pomona fire
Inspector George Barrigan said Tuesday after cleanup crews dug
their way through the filth, sometimes ducking to avoid hitting
their heads as they walked on garbage piled three feet deep.
   ``There's everything imaginable in there _ clothes, rotting
food, rats, bugs, you name it. It's unbelievable,'' said Pomona
Fire Chief Tom Fee. He estimated the cleanup, which began Monday,
would be completed today.
   Masked excavation workers used shovels and a tractor to scoop up
the garbage and haul it away.
   Homeowner Erleen Burman, 71, was unhappy with the cleanup,
however, protesting that she had been accumulating the contents of
the home for years. The single-story home sits in a neighborhood of
$100,000 houses.
   ``It's my whole life,'' she said.
   Ms. Burman concedes she hasn't cleaned her house in years.
``I've been sick for 20 years. I'm trying to find another husband.
I need somebody to help me, you know, paint the house and help pay
for the food.''
   The retired hairdresser said she sleeps, but doesn't eat, in her
home.
   ``I struggle off somewhere to get something to eat and then come
back here for a rest,'' she said, adding she frequently visits her
daughter's home.
   As workers sorted through the rubble Tuesday, she pointed at
piles of filth and said, ``This isn't all mine.'' She shook her
head vaguely and said, ``My husband ...'' Then, her voice trailed
off.
   Twenty tons of garbage and seven refrigerators were removed from
the home's back yard by a private contractor hired for $4,000. Ms.
Burman must pay the costs.
   ``I carried out stacks of wood completely rotten with
termites,'' said contractor Curnelius King. ``I flipped over a
refrigerator and a rat jumped straight in the air.''
   Fire Department officials originally became aware of the filth
five or six years ago while investigating a fire call that turned
out to be a false alarm, Fire Capt. Terry Staudenmayer said. They
were unable to do anything at that time, he said.
   ``If it's not producing rats, we can't do anything,'' he
explained, adding the case was then turned over to the Los Angeles
County Health Department.
   The Fire Department was called back March 19 because Ms. Burman
hadn't been seen for some time and neighbors were describing
``hundreds of rats on the roof,'' Staudenmayer said.

   Idaho's less-than-suspenseful Republican
presidential primary added another win to Vice President George
Bush's column. Michael Dukakis cruised to an easy victory in the
Democratic ``beauty contest.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Bush had 82 percent
of the vote to 9 percent for Pat Robertson, who suspended his
campaign earlier this month to rejoin the Christian Broadcasting
Network.
   Bush was winning 15 of the 18 national convention delegates at
stake in the lackluster primary Tuesday, with two going to
Robertson and one in the uncommitted column.
   Dukakis was pulling in 73 percent of the vote to 16 percent for
Jesse Jackson, with only a handful of precincts still unreported.
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had 4 percent and Sen. Paul Simon 3 percent;
both have suspended their presidential campaigns.
   The Democratic vote was not binding. Dukakis, the front-runner,
claimed a majority of the delegates at caucuses two months ago.
   With no statewide elected offices at stake this year and the
presidential candidates all but formally crowned, there was little
to draw Idaho voters to the polls beyond a handful of heated
legislative and local races.
   ``For various reasons, the presidential election and others,
neither we nor the county clerks are seeing very much intensity in
this one,'' Deputy Secretary of State Ben Ysursa said.
   In congressional primaries, state Rep. Jeanne Givens rolled up a
large victory over two challengers to take the Democratic
nomination to face four-term Republican Congressman Larry Craig in
the 1st District.
   Former state Sen. Dane Watkins won the Republican nomination to
challenge two-term Democratic Congressman Richard Stallings this
fall in the state's 2nd District.
   Bush made a 19-hour campaign swing through Idaho earlier this
month to bolster his support in a state that has not given its four
electoral votes to a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
   Democrats allotted 18 of their 24 nominating delegates in Super
Tuesday caucuses held on March 8. Dukakis captured eight of them,
Jackson four and six were uncommitted.
   Since then, however, Gov. Cecil Andrus, one of the six
previously uncommitted ``super delegates,'' has endorsed Dukakis
and urged others to do the same so the party is clearly unified for
the November assault on the White House.
   Although there has been no statewide polling conducted, a
Democratic poll this spring in the conservative 2nd Congressional
District of southern Idaho showed Dukakis only 2 percentage points
behind Bush.
   ``But it's a long time to the finish line,'' said state Senate
President Pro Tem James Risch of Boise, Bush's state chairman.
``The people will have a choice between a person who knows the
issues and a governor of a state that really hasn't done very
well.''

<TEXT>
   A retiree described by neighbors as a
recluse is accused in federal court documents of having been
second-in-command of a system of Nazi slave-labor camps during
World War II.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations filed
a civil complaint Tuesday claiming that Juris Kauls of Sun City
West, believed to be 75 years old, was the deputy chief and
inspector of guards in 1941 and 1942 for 14 concentration camps at
Riga, Latvia.
   ``The concentration camp was a place of persecution for its
prisoners,'' says the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court.
``Such persecution included ... the incarceration of civilians
solely because of their race, religion, political beliefs or
national origin.''
   According to the complaint, the camps' prisoners were used
primarily for slave labor, but some were beaten, starved and
executed.
   ``It was a terrible facility but not as well-known as
Auschwitz,'' said Neal Sher, director of the Office of Special
Investigations in Washington.
   The office requested that Kauls, who moved to Arizona from
Indianapolis, be deported because he allegedly concealed his
involvement with the Nazis in order to become a naturalized U.S.
citizen.
   Kauls entered Canada in February 1951, entered the United States
in 1954, applied for permanent-resident status in Detroit and
became a U.S. citizen April 13, 1960, according to the complaint.
   A woman who answered the door at the Kauls' residence and
identified herself as Kauls' wife was asked about the allegations.
   ``That's not possible. We are United States citizens,'' she said.
   She refused to talk further with reporters.
   Neighbors said the couple rarely left their home in the
retirement community except to go shopping.
   Nazi hunters at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust
Studies in Los Angeles and the Jewish Anti-Defamation League in New
York said they were not familiar with Kauls.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with Coast Guard version of seizure.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A weekend fisherman who enlisted the American Civil
Liberties Union to fight the federal government's ``Zero
Tolerance'' policy says he is outraged over the Coast Guard's
seizure of his boat for ``absolutely nothing.''
   ACLU lawyer Barbara S. Levenson said U.S. Customs has two days
to return the boat of Jean Sebastian Gros, 28, before the Miami
ACLU chapter plans to go to federal court seeking an injunction
against the Coast Guard and Customs for return of the boat.
   She said she filed a petition Tuesday with Customs for the
23-foot boat's return.
   The day before, Coast Guard and Customs Service officials
announced they were slightly refining the use of the Reagan
administration's policy under which boats, cars and other vehicles
have been confiscated if even a trace of illegal drugs is found in
them.
   The modifications prohibit the Coast Guard from seizing boats
outside the 12-mile territorial limit if there is no evidence of
intent to smuggle. Apart from those changes, however, Attorney
General Edwin Meese III said Tuesday there is ``no softening
whatsoever'' of the policy.
   Ms. Levenson said the ACLU is lining up challenges because she
is ``afraid we may be approaching a police state.''
   ``We feel that Mr. Gros represents many, many recreational boat
users who enjoy their boats, who ... are not drug dealers, but
merely Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer,'' she said. ``The reason for
`Zero Tolerance' does not justify suspension of the Constitution.''
   Gros, a Plantation resident, said Tuesday he is outraged over
the May 15 confiscation of his new $40,000 boat by the Coast Guard.
He uses it for his recreational fishing excursions to the Bahamas.
   ``They went through everything _ I mean my entire boat,'' said
Gros, a service station owner who insists he neither uses illegal
drugs nor condones their use.
   ``We had absolutely nothing on board. They never showed me what
they found,'' Gros said. ``They say they scraped up six grains,
approximately a gram, and it tested positive for THC (the active
ingredient in marijuana). It's simply not true.''
   Gros said his boat was searched by two armed Coast Guardsmen,
confiscated 7 miles off the Bahamanian island of Bimini, which is
beyond the 12-mile limit, and impounded at the Coast Guard Station
in Miami Beach about 45 miles away.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. James Simpson said the Robalo at first
stopped for the Coast Guard, then ``took off running'' and was
chased for about five minutes before being boarded.
   ``The boarding team found about half a gram of substance on the
deck in the open behind the seat, tested that and it came up
positive,'' Simpson said. ``Based on one, the vessel fleeing
boarding by a Coast Guard vessel and two, finding a quantity of
controlled substance,'' a further search was authorized, Simpson
said.
   Small quantities of what tested as marijuana were subsequently
found on the boat's console and in a mop, he said.

   A group of up to six Israeli diplomats will
leave for Moscow, possibly by next week, as the first Israelis to
take up consular duties there in 21 years, officials and news
reports said today.
   The Soviets agreed to issue visas to the Israelis at a secret
meeting in Zurich, Switzerland on Monday, said Foreign Ministry
political adviser Nimrod Novick, who negotiated for the visas.
   Novick told Israeli army radio the diplomats' main job in Moscow
will be to administer an embassy building for which Israel has been
paying monthly rent even though it has been empty for 21 years.
   Agreement for the visas came 10 months after Soviet consular
officials began operating from the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Novick said he hoped the consular visit to the Soviet Union
could lead to renewal of full diplomatic ties with Moscow, but
described the current agreement as less than a breakthrough.
   ``What we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to
check if it is hot or cold. It remains to be seen when our
delegates reach Moscow, how well they will be received,'' Novick
said.
   He added that the agreement followed two months of secret
contacts with Vladimir Terrasov, the deputy head of the Soviet
Foreign Ministry's Middle East department.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel during
the 1967 Middle East War, when the Jewish state captured the West
Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights from the Kremlin's Arab allies.
   Kremlin leaders have improved ties with Israel in the last two
years largely as part of an effort to become involved in
peacemaking efforts in the Middle East.
   The Soviets held numerous meetings with Israelis abroad and then
sent an eight-member consular team to Israel in July 1987.
   The Israeli diplomats will number as many as six and work from
the Dutch Embassy in processing visas for Soviet Jewish emigrants,
Israeli news reports and officials said.
   There was no date set for when the visas would be issued. But
one Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Israeli diplomats could be on their way to Moscow as early
as next week.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said the visas may come this week or in
advance of the superpower summmit in Moscow.
   Novick indicated that Israel had sought a broader role for its
diplomats, which would include handling visas for Soviet Jewish
emigrants.
   ``It looked like it was broadening things to the Soviets,''
Novick said, adding that now ``there is no argument between us and
the Soviets that our group will have a mandate as outlined, to
check out the Israeli Embassy building'' in Moscow.
   He added that the Soviets had agreed there would be ``no
restrictions'' placed on other contacts between the Israelis and
Jews in the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Jersey City's schools are in an ``advanced
stage of decay,'' New Jersey's education commissioner charged in
announcing the state will attempt to seize control of the
32,000-student district.
   It would be the first time a state has taken over such a big
urban district, New Jersey's second-largest, said the National
Governors Association in Washington.
   Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman, citing rampant political
patronage, mismanaged schools and chronic failure to educate the
district's students, began efforts to take over the district on
Tuesday.
   The school system in Jersey City, an ethnic melting pot of more
than 200,000 people, many of them recent immigrants, has come under
fire for poor test scores and a high dropout rate. The city is
across the Hudson River from New York City.
   An independent auditor's report cited by the state also charged
that jobs in the school system are treated as political paybacks,
and courses are so outdated that one on Africa failed to list 17
countries formed since 1958.
   ``As is true of other enterprises that reach such an advanced
stage of decay, the Jersey City school district offers a compelling
case for bolder, more decisive and non-traditional intervention by
higher public authorities,'' Cooperman said at a news conference.
   The commissioner said district administrators are incapable of
properly running the schools or fixing widespread problems.
   ``Political patronage, union pressure and cronyism is a
consistent motivation, at all levels, in the hiring, firing and
promoting of staff,'' he said.
   Under New Jersey legislation enacted five months ago, Cooperman
could abolish the local board of education, fire the superintendent
and top administrators and appoint a state superintendent to
operate the schools for at least five years.
   The law gives New Jersey officials some of the broadest powers
in the nation to take control of deficient school districts.
   The district has 10 days to accept Cooperman's decision or
respond with reasons why it shouldn't be taken over.
   Jersey City Board of Education spokeswoman Leslie Silberman said
the panel would not comment on Cooperman's recommendation until
reviewing the report.
   Meanwhile, the state Division of Criminal Justice is to
determine whether local officials have committed any crimes.
   Auditors found inadequate record keeping, missing contract
documents and questionable payroll, personnel and procurement
practices. The district has wasted more than $1.2 million on an
improper health insurance plan, the report said.
   Richard Kaplan, who ran a separate investigation for the state,
said employees routinely were rewarded or demoted based upon which
mayoral candidate they backed in the Democratic stronghold.
   In addition, curriculum guides in Jersey City are so outdated
that a course guide for a high school class on Africa fails to list
17 countries formed between 1958 and 1980, and lists four countries
that no longer exist.
   Teachers weren't optimistic Tuesday that state control would end
the district's problems.
   Mike Bogart, a grammar school teacher, said over time, rules
have been forgotten and replaced with double standards. ``We can't
come back, but I guess we've got to try,'' Bogart said.
   Schools Superintendent Franklin Williams has said if the
district were properly funded, the state would not need to take it
over.
   He also said that conditions are not as bad as the state
maintains and that many problems stem from the city's high crime
rate, and drug problems and poverty among district students, many
of whom are homeless or do not speak English.
   Cooperman countered that the district has enough money, but it
hasn't been properly spent. ``It's bleak,'' he said. ``I've read
everything and respect the superintendent. The facts are stubborn
things.''

<TEXT>
   More than a thousand soccer fans stoned police
and players and looted a hotel and police station after police
detained one unruly fan, an official report said today. More than
60 police were reported injured.
   Police arrested 43 people during the violence that began Monday
and continued through Tuesday morning in the southwestern town of
Nanchong in Sichuan province, the Sports News said.
   It said 13 of the police were seriously injured, but did not say
how many fans were hurt.
   The incident appeared symptomatic of growing violence in Chinese
society in the past few years. One the one hand, official control
over people's lives have relaxed somewhat, but frustrations have
risen because incomes have not soared as quickly as expected.
   Sports News said the riot began at 6:45 p.m. when several fans
jumped into the field to protest the referee's calls at the end of
a 1-1 match between the Sichuan province and Tianjin city youth
teams.
   Police detained one worker for questioning, the report said,
prompting more than 1,000 other fans to block the stadium gate and
demand his release, the report said. The rioters threw bricks,
stones and bottles at the police and retiring players, smashed
windows and set a police car on fire.
   After police escorted the players to a local police office and a
hotel, the mob broke hotel windows and stole stores of cigarettes
and beer. Several dozen other people broke into the police office,
damaged several rooms and stole cattle prods, handcuffs, cameras
and fire-fighting equipment, the newspaper said.
   Police beat and arrested 43 people at the station, it said.
   The violence ``basically subsided'' by morning, it said, and the
local and prefectural governments convened emergency meetings to
discuss the riot.
   It was not the first time sports passions translated into
violence in China.
   In 1985, angry fans threw rocks and bottles, attacked police and
spat at foreigners in Beijing after Hong Kong's soccer team
defeated China 2-1 in World Cup qualifying play. Five youths were
charged with hooliganism.
   The same year, fans in Shijiazhuang, 150 miles southwest of
Beijing, stoned a referee and smashed seven vehicles when the
referee disallowed a goal for the local team in national
championship play.
   One soccer player stabbed another with a kitchen knife and their
coaches exchanged punches at a match in western China's Gansu
province in 1986.
   Reports of street violence, including gang fights, and rural
violence over such problems as allocation of scarce fertilizer also
have risen in recent years.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Abandoning Children Ordered To Remain On Birth
Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a young woman to remain on
birth control for the rest of her child-bearing years for
abandoning her two young sons in a sweltering apartment last summer.
   Debra Ann Forster's attorney and the head of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Arizona objected to the sentence Tuesday as a
violation of the 18-year-old Mesa woman's constitutional rights.
   Superior Court Judge Lindsay Ellis Budzyn sentenced Ms. Forster
to lifetime probation and ordered her to give regular written proof
to her probation officer that she is on birth control.
   ``Your case represents the epitome of what's wrong with our
society: A child having children,'' the judge said.
   Ms. Forster pleaded guilty in April to two counts of attempted
felony child abuse.
   Her estranged husband found the two boys _ ages 18 months and 6
months _ in the apartment where police say they had been left alone
for two days.
   The children were suffering from malnutrition, dehydration and
lesions caused by a rash and were hospitalized in serious condition
for eight days.
   Police said Ms. Forster told them she left the children because
she was unable to cope with the pressure of caring for them. She
said she had used drugs to escape from the pressures and had
attempted suicide, police reported.
   Louis Rhodes, executive director of the ACLU in Arizona, called
the sentence a ``stunning violation of a person's right,'' and
Robert Billar, a deputy public defender, said it violated her right
to privacy.
   But the judge said Ms. Forster's ``lack of nurturing'' and the
``close call the children had with death'' merited such an order.
   The judge also barred Ms. Foster from seeing her sons or the
daughter she bore in prison two months ago. She also was told that
she cannot babysit for others.
   Court records show that Ms. Forster's daughter has been adopted
and that her sons also have been put up for adoption.
   ``I know I did something wrong, and I have to pay for it. I'm
sorry,'' a tearful Ms. Foster she told the judge.

   Thousands of people caught a long-awaited
glimpse of two giant pandas that went on display at the Toledo Zoo
over the objections of a conservation group that wants the
endangered animals returned to China.
   The exhibit, which began Tuesday after nine months of planning,
marks the first time the Chinese have permitted two pandas to be
exhibited together at a U.S. zoo. The animals are on loan to the
zoo until Aug. 21.
   Le Le and Nan Nan made their debut before an invitation-only
crowd of about 250. Later, the zoo opened its gates to hundreds who
had waited in line since dawn.
   About 5,000 people visited the zoo on Tuesday, zoo spokeswoman
Betsy Clark said. The zoo has between 2,000 and 3,000 visitors on
an average weekday. Up to 1 million are expected to see the pandas
by the time the display ends.
   ``They're so cute,'' said Lorraine Grove, 18, of Port Clinton.
``I waited on line for three hours, but it was definitely worth
it.''
   The international World Wildlife Fund contends the exhibit could
endanger the pandas and had gone to court to prevent the animals
from going on display.
   In Washington, the wildlife fund asked a federal court Tuesday
to shut down the exhibit, charging it represents commercial use of
the pandas in violation of the Endangered Species Act and an
international wildlife convention.
   The group asked for an expedited hearing, which is expected to
be set after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service files its response
within five days.
   ``It is the first short-term panda exhibit in which both animals
are of prime breeding age and were taken from a captive breeding
and research facility,'' said Kenneth Cook, spokesman for the
wildlife fund.
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that among zoo professionals and
conservationists, these might be considered to be among two of the
most valuable animals on the planet.''
   The zoo has spent nearly $3 million in preparing to exhibit the
pandas, including $1.9 million for their quarters. Edwin Bergsmark,
president of the Toledo Zoological Society, said the exhibit is
aimed primarily at children.
   ``They are, perhaps, the last generation that will be able to
enjoy seeing the giant pandas if the immense conservation efforts
being employed by the Chinese do not receive unified support from
the conservation world,'' he said.
   Viki Billis and her 21-month-old son, Andrew, were among the
first in line.
   ``This is very exciting for Toledo. We needed this. Every mother
and father should take time out and bring their children to the
zoo,'' Mrs. Billis said.

   A 63-year-old man who raised his
window shade every morning to let neighbors know he was all right
was found slain after he failed to give the signal.
   Neighbors who entered William J. Carr's house Tuesday afternoon
found his body in his upstairs bedroom with his throat slit, his
hands bound with an electrical cord and a rope tied around his
neck, police said.
   Carr had apparently been dead for 24 to 36 hours, police said.
Police Chief Donald Oliver said police found three knives on the
bureau in Carr's bedroom and were searching for his car, which was
missing.
   Grace Skipp, a next-door neighbor, said she and her landlord did
not react immediately to the drawn shade because Carr's car was not
in his driveway. Skipp said she and the landlord assumed Carr had
gone out and forgot to raise the shade.
   Carr's dog led Skipp and the landlord to the body when they
finally decided to go inside and check.
   Carr, a bachelor who lived alone, arranged with his neighbors to
watch the window shade after he had a heart attack several years
ago, Skipp said.

   A Soviet army spokesman today said that 13,310
Soviet troops have been killed in Afghanistan and 35,478 wounded
since the Soviet Union entered the Afghan war in December 1979.
   In the first official statement on casualties from the war, Gen.
Alexei D. Lizichev, head of the army and navy political
departments, also told a news conference that 311 Soviets had
``disappeared.'' They are believed to have been captured by rebels
or to have deserted.
   The figures, through May 1, were higher than Western sources had
estimated. A U.S. State Department report in late 1987 estimated
there had been 33,000 to 38,000 casualties, about a third of which
were deaths.
   Lizichev's casualty figures were in line with a May 19 statement
from Eduard Rosenthal, commentator for the official Novosti press
agency, that news reports estimating fatalities between 12,000 and
15,000 were ``more or less correct.''
   Lizichev said 9,500 of the Soviet officers and troops in
Afghanistan have left their bases since the pullout began May 15.
He refused to give a figure for the Soviet force in Afghanistan
before the pullout began, but Western estimates say they numbered
about 115,000.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov and Lizichev held fast to
the Kremlin position that Soviet intervention in Afghanistan's
civil war was justified. ``Soviet troops had been invited to
Afghanistan by the government,'' Vorontsov said. ``That is a fact.
This cannot be reassessed.''
   Asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the Brezhnev
Doctrine, the Kremlin policy developed under late leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev of military intervention to protect socialist revolutions,
Vorontsov said past practices do not apply to the new Kremlin.
   Vorontsov said the Soviet armed forces are committed to
protecting allies but did not make clear whether that protection
extended to ideological threats.
   Lizichev said Soviet policy has not changed, that it was only
recently that there were conditions that allowed the Kremlin to
leave Afghan government troops to fight on their own against the
Moslem guerrillas.
   Soviet officials and the state-run media have cast the pullout
as a successful conclusion to an intervention that has inflicted
heavy damage on international relations as well as on the Soviet
public.
   The Afghan government, meanwhile, charged for the fourth time in
recent days that Pakistan is violating the peace accord that led to
the start of the Soviet withdrawal, the official Soviet news agency
Tass reported today.
   Tass quoted the Afghan government as saying Pakistan continues
to supply weapons to the U.S.-backed guerrilas in violation of the
accord.
   In another development, Western diplomats in Pakistan said the
Kremlin probably won't meet its goal of withdrawing a quarter of
its soldiers from Afghanistan this month because the guerrillas are
overwhelming Afghan troops left behind.
   Agreements were signed in Geneva on April 14 outlining
conditions for a pullout of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Among
the stipulations was a requirement that Pakistan stop supplying
arms to the anti-communist insurgents fighting the Kabul government
of President Najib.
   Tass said the Afghan Foreign Ministry lodged its complaint
against Pakistan with United Nations observers monitoring the
Soviet pullout. The complaint, as reported by Tass, gave no
specific details of the alleged violations.
   Under the Geneva accords, half the Soviet troops must be out of
Afghanistan by Aug. 15 with the pullout completed by next Feb. 15.
Soviet Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov has said 25 percent of Soviet force
will be out by the end of May.
   In Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, diplomats said the
guerrillas have harassed departing Red Army convoys and overrun a
string of bases defended only by Afghan soldiers. Most of the bases
are on the eastern border with Pakistan.

   A U.S. attorney picked by Attorney General
Edwin Meese III for a top Justice Department post said today he
accepted the position without hesitation despite ongoing criminal
investigations of the attorney general.
   Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia, said
he did not talk to Meese about an independent counsel's
investigation of the attorney general when he was tapped for the
job.
   ``No, we did not discuss that at all,'' Dennis said on CBS-TV's
``This Morning'' program. ``I feel that the process with regard to
the independent counsel is going forward and that will resolve
itself. And in any case, the criminal division still has a mission
which, hopefully, I can help fill.''
   Dennis said he accepted the post as assistant attorney general
in charge of the criminal division ``without any hesitation.''
Asked if he could complete his agenda despite Meese's legal
problems, Dennis said, ``I'm certainly going to do the best that I
can.''
   Before Dennis was picked, aides to the attorney general
approached a former U.S. attorney and three current U.S. attorneys
in an attempt to find a nominee. All four men rejected the
overtures.
   Dennis, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the only ranking
black official at the Justice Department.
   President Reagan announced Tuesday his intention to nominate
Dennis, and to nominate Harold G. Christensen, a Salt Lake City,
Utah, attorney, to become deputy attorney general.
   Meese said that the two will fill the jobs on an acting basis
until the Senate confirmation process is complete.
   They would replace Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and
criminal division chief William Weld, who both quit out of concern
that Meese's continued tenure was hurting the Justice Department's
operations, morale and public image.
   A year-old criminal investigation of Meese's financial affairs
by independent counsel James McKay has focused on Meese's
involvement with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and an Iraqi oil
pipeline project. McKay's office is preparing a report that is
expected to raise questions about the attorney general's ethical
behavior.
   Christensen was Meese's third choice for the job after one
candidate rejected an offer and another withdrew his name from
consideration.
   Dennis said he had not spoken with his predecessor, Weld, about
his reasons for leaving. He said ``if there's a morale problem'' in
the criminal division, he plans to ``try to do my part'' to
overcome it.
   Dennis said Tuesday he had no reason to suspect the attorney
general's ethics and added that in his dealings with Meese ``he's
always been above board.'' Dennis said he intends to serve in the
position through the remainder of the Reagan administration.
   Christensen is a senior partner in a 60-lawyer law firm and was
president of the Utah State Bar in 1975-76. A registered
Republican, he has never held a government job and has not been
active in politics.
   Dennis' office obtained convictions of more than 30 Philadelphia
police officers, including the deputy police commissioner, on
extortion and racketeering charges.
   Dennis handled the successful prosecution of Nicodemo Scarfo,
the reputed head of organized crime in the Philadelphia area, and
city Councilman Leland Beloff for allegedly trying to extort $1
million from a developer to obtain City Council approval to build a
waterfront development.

<HEAD>Two White Police Officers Convicted Of Murdering Black</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS with four grafs to CORRECT spelling of de Villiers,

`The verdict...'</NOTE>

   Two white policemen implicated
by fellow officers were convicted today of murdering a black youth
after beating him so severely they did not dare let him go free.
   The trial, which began last October, is one of the few in South
African history in which white policemen have testified against
colleagues facing the death penalty for alleged brutality against
blacks.
   The convicted men, Warrant Officer Leon de Villiers, 37, and
Constable David Goosen, 27, are expected to be sentenced later this
week after arguments about extenuating circumstances. They were
allowed to remain free on $250 bail.
   Justice N.W. Zietsman, who presided over the non-jury trial,
said de Villiers had led his unit into a black township on a
``beating expedition'' and assaulted residents indiscriminately. He
praised police investigators who pressed ahead with the case after
other members of the unit initially tried to cover up the incident.
   The verdict was to have been delivered Monday, but de Villiers
collapsed in court and was taken to a hospital. He was present for
today's proceedings at the Supreme Court in Grahamstown in eastern
Cape Province.
   De Villiers and Goosen had been charged with two counts of
murder in connection with killings on July 26, 1986, in the black
section of Cradock, a community near Grahamstown. They were
acquitted on one count but convicted of the murder of 18-year-old
Mlungisi Stuurman.
   According to testimony, members of de Villiers' all-white riot
squad drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing
themselves to secrecy, and then made an unauthorized foray into the
township in the middle of the night during which several blacks
were assaulted.
   Following another bout of drinking at their base, the squad
returned to the township after daybreak.
   Stuurman, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan ``Forward
To People's Power,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he
tried to walk away from them and was assaulted, several officers
testified.
   The officers said de Villiers ordered that Stuurman should be
``taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries. They said
Goosen took the youth to a riverbank and shot him in the back of
the neck.
   The defendants contended that the shooting was an accident. De
Villiers said he did not report the incident because he was still
under the influence of alcohol.

<HEAD>Yazov Criticizes Readiness, Discipline of Soviet Forces in East
Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov says Soviet
soldiers in East Germany lack discipline and battle preparedness,
the ministry daily Krasnaya Zvezda reported today.
   Red Star said Yazov addressed a special meeting of senior army
officers from the East German detachment, estimated by Western
sources to number about 380,000 soldiers, as part of the
preparations for next month's Communist Party conference.
   He pressed for reform of the military units stationed in the
allied country and championed Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of ``perestroika,'' or rebuilding, as the appropriate
foundation for building a better fighting force.
   Yazov, who became head of the Kremlin's armed forces a year ago,
appeared to be stumping for the leader's policies among military
officials before the party conference, which is expected to be a
faceoff between reform advocates and conservatives.
   He made the address in East Germany, but the newspaper did not
say when or in what city the gathering took place.
   The defense minister provided no specific examples of poor
performance by the troops serving in East Germany, but he delivered
a largely critical report on their military preparedness, according
to the newspaper.
   Yazov blamed the substandard conditions within the military
units on ``stagnant tendencies, low attentiveness and
oversimplification.''
   ``The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people
demand of us that we liquidate these negative tendencies in the
army which are harming military readiness,'' Yazov told the
officers.
   It was not clear how many were present for his scolding, but the
newspaper said the meeting was attended by several other generals
and staff members of the Soviet Military Council, Marshal Nikolai
V. Ogarkov and the Soviet ambassador to East Germany.
   ``Many of the party organizations of the GSSG (Group of Soviet
Soldiers in Germany) have yet to show themselves to be generators
of perestroika,'' Yazov was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper said he brought up ``problems of improving the
quality of military preparedness and gave constructive
recommendations'' for change. Red Star did not report Yazov's
suggestions.
   Yazov told the meeting that part of the problem was adherence to
the ``administrative-command'' form of management, a phrase that
has come to refer to the leadership style of late dictator Josef V.
Stalin.
   The gap between commanders and leaders and their subordinates
must be narrowed and the needs, concerns and interests of the
soldiers taken into consideration in all decision-making, the
newspaper quoted Yazov as saying.
   Yazov was named to succeed Marshal Sergei L. Sokolov on May 30,
1987, two days after West German teen-age pilot Mathias Rust
slipped past the Soviet Air Defense forces in the Baltic, flew his
single-engine plane undetered over more than 500 miles of Soviet
territory and landed in Red Square.
   Yazov became a candidate, or non-voting member, of the ruling
Politburo a month later. He has called for reform of the military
services in the few articles and speeches he has given.
   Yazov met with his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, in Switzerland in March.

<HEAD>Trustee Warns Of PTL's Demise, Contributors Call For Bakker's
Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL's new trustee has warned that the TV
ministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakker will have to go off the air
and close its Christian theme park next month if contributions keep
dwindling.
   After Tuesday's hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, tearful PTL
contributors urged the trustee to allow Bakker's appearance on
cable television to solicit donations they said would save the
ministry.
   M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the trustee, said he wouldn't rule out
allowing Bakker's limited return _ ``if it's the best and logical
next step for the ministry.''
   PTL, with current debts of about $130 million and assets of $160
million, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors in
bankruptcy court in June after Bakker's resignation in a sex and
hush-money scandal.
   ``We're considerably short of money now, and we're going to have
to have some money soon to operate. Contributions have about dried
up,'' Benton said at the hearing.
   In the last three weeks, contributions have dwindled from
$60,000 a day to $22,000 a day, Benton said. It costs $27,000 a day
just to pay the network affiliates, he said later.
   Benton testified that the ministry may not be able to keep
airing the ``PTL Club'' TV show, its primary method of seeking
contributions. ``The next step is to shut down, and that I'm
prepared to do,'' he said.
   Benton was appointed Friday to succeed former Christian
Broadcasting Network executive David Clark, who said he resigned so
he wouldn't have to preside over the ministry's liquidation.
   A revised reorganization plan filed last week called for the
trustee to liquidate PTL's assets in order to pay creditors.
   Under the proposal, the 2,300-acre Heritage USA complex in Fort
Mill would be sold and a separate, non-profit corporation would
lease the property required to operate the church and network
television programs.
   PTL is negotiating with non-religious buyers, including a sports
executive who wants to build a sports complex on the grounds.
   After the hearing, Paul Wood, a spokesman for a group of PTL's
big-money contributors, said the donors represents had pledged $81
million to the ministry if Bakker is allowed on the PTL network
``to ask for forgiveness.''
   ``Everybody else has tried and failed _ why not Bakker?'' said
Wood.
   Benton, PTL executive vice president for accounting and
operational affairs since Feb. 1, said that PTL should be able to
meet the June 3 payroll, but that he was uncertain whether
operating expenses could be met after that date.

   Iraq said it launched a major ground
offensive east of Basra today to retake Iraqi territory captured by
Iran 16 months ago. Iran said it repulsed the attack.
   Iraq also said its warplanes destroyed a power station in
northern Iran, and Tehran said a separate Iraqi air raid killed 28
civilians in northwestern Iran.
   The latest hostilities coincided with the opening in Baghdad of
a ``Global Popular Conference on Peace'' attended by delegates from
dozens of countries.
   State-run Baghdad radio broke into regular programming to
broadcast a military communique announcing the Iraqi ground
offensive. It said Iraqi forces made ``considerable gains'' in the
operation code-named ``On God We Depend,'' but it gave no casualty
figures.
   ``Our men attacked the enemy forces to get rid of them and crush
their heads, which are empty of human values,'' the communique said.
   A later communique carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency
said Iraqi forces took the southern end of Fish Lake, a large body
of water created by the Iraqis on the border as an obstacle to
Iranian attack.
   The lake was the scene of fierce fighting when Iran took the
area in January 1987.
   Iraqi troops, including elite Presidential Guards, also took the
Jasim River running through the area, as well as two police posts
that had been occupied by the Iranians, the communique said.
   The attack came after warnings by Iraq that it could launch a
major offensive if Iran continued to reject a settlement of the
nearly 8-year-old Persian Gulf war. It also came the day after Iraq
warned it would retaliate for alleged Iranian shelling of Iraqi
border towns.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said the ground attack was
repulsed. It said fighting was continuing but Iranian forces held
their ground, ``vigilantly defending their positions.''
   Iranian forces in January 1987 advanced on a 25-mile-wide front
to within six miles of the southern town of Basra and have held
much of that territory since.
   The Iranian agency reported an Iraqi thrust in the northern
Iraqi Sulaymaniyah region but said it was crushed with the
attackers sustaining ``heavy losses and casualties.''
   Iraqi air raids on the northwestern Iranian border town of
Sardasht killed 28 civilians, Iran said. Iraq did not comment on
the claim.
   The Iraqi News Agency said warplanes flew more than 600 miles to
bomb a power station near the Caspian Sea 125 miles northeast of
Tehran, ``turning it into ashes.'' Iran said the bombs hit workers'
houses but reported no casualties.
   Iraq's news agency said the peace conference in Baghdad was
attended by a ``large number of political and social figures'' from
various countries.
   Tehran radio said Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi told
reporters that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ``aim in holding
the so-called peace conference is only to prevent disclosure of
facts in regard with identification of the aggressor.'' Iran has
said it will not agree to a cease-fire unless Iraq first is branded
the aggressor in the war.
   Elsewhere today, Vernon Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, arrived in the United Arab Emirates for talks on
means for achieving a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and for
resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Walters is on a Middle East tour that has taken him so far to
Israel, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman. His itinerary also
includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.

   A general strike commemorating a slain
Palestinian military leader virtually shut down the occupied
territories today, and the army clamped a curfew on at least five
refugee camps and Arab villages.
   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a
Palestinian youth during a clash with young men throwing stones and
bottles in the Nur Shams refugee camp, officials at Rafidiyeh
Hospital said.
   A military spokesman confirmed that a youth was shot in the camp
today. Hospital officials said the victim, Nasser Sulayman, was in
critical condition with a gunshot wound in the chest.
   Tuesday night, soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old
Palestinian during a similar clash with stone-throwers in the West
Bank town of Tulkarem, officials at Tulkarem Hospital said. Army
officials said they had no information on the report.
   During today's general strike, an indefinite curfew was placed
on the Dheishe refugee camp, largest in the West Bank, and four
locations in the Gaza Strip.
   The strike was called to mark the end of mourning 40 days after
the assassination in Tunisia of Khalil Wazir, also known as Abu
Jihad. He was military chief of Fatah, the largest faction in the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and deputy to PLO chief Yasser
Arafat.
   Palestinian, Israeli, and other sources say Israeli commandos
carried out the attack, but the Israeli government has declined
comment.
   Ahmed Wazir, a cousin of the slain PLO leader, said Israeli
soldiers showed up at his Gaza City house today to prevent a
reception marking the assassination.
   ``The army is outside our house,'' Wazir said in a telephone
interview. ``They turned back anyone who came here.''
   In walled, old city of Jerusalem, a firebomb was thrown Tuesday
at the car of Trade and Commerce Minister Ariel Sharon, as his
wife, Lily, was about to drive from their home, the daily Maariv
newspaper reported.
   No casualties were reported. The paper quoted Mrs. Sharon as
saying she was not even aware the firebomb was thrown. ``Maybe they
should try again,'' she was quoted as saying.
   Israel radio reported, meanwhile, that the military government
in the occupied territories threatened to jail Arab property owners
for up to five years if they do not wash anti-Israeli graffiti from
their buildings and remove outlawed Palestinian flags.
   The military had no immediate comment on the report, which said
those who did not comply could also be fined $9,670.
   Israeli authorities are attempting to put down resistance to
their occupation of the territories, which they seized in the 1967
Middle East War. Since Dec. 8, at least 195 Palestinians and two
Israelis have been killed in the unrest.
   An Israeli today was indicted for manslaughter in the fatal
shooting of a Palestinian shepherd on May 5 near the Jewish
settlement of Shiloh in the West Bank, Israel radio reported.
   It quoted the indictment as saying Yisrael Zeev fired at a group
of Arab shepherds just after they shouted to him that they would
stop grazing sheep on disputed land near Shiloh. One of the
shepherds was killed and another wounded.
   Stores were closed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
transportation was shut down, and most Palestinian workers did not
go to jobs in Israel.
   Witnesses said the general strike was observed throughout the
occupied land and Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   ``The Intefadah (Arab for uprising) is still going on and will
continue until victory and the creation of our independent state,''
said an underground leaflet signed by the PLO@Unified Command of
the Uprising in the Occupied Territories.
   The only commerce today seemed to be vendors selling newspapers
and doughnut-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds that is an Arab
staple.
   West Bank primary schools, where classes resumed Monday for the
first time in four months, were open despite the strike. Government
spokesman Olivier Rafovicz said about 90 percent of the 200,000
students attended.
   The return to school apparently has the support of Arab
underground leaders who wrote in the latest leaflet, the 17th
issued since December: ``We will continue in the civilized path of
our people by more learning and education.''
   Israeli army officials have said they would open West Bank high
schools if students did not participate in demonstrations.
   The government today charged two editors of the left-wing
newspaper Derech Hanitzotz with membership in a guerrilla
organization and having contacts with a foreign agent, Israel radio
reported. The two, Yaacov Ben Efrat and Assaf Adiv, face up to 40
years in jail if convicted.
   Earlier this week, the government indicted two other newspaper
employees on the same charges.
   The four are accused of belonging to the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction.

   Syria warned kidnappers that any harm
done to Western hostages in Lebanon would be an ``infringement of
Syria's security,'' the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar
reported today.
   The prestigious daily cited no source for its 15-word report,
which failed to say how and when the warning was conveyed or what
the Syrian reaction would be if the warning was not heeded.
   Also today, the Norwegian Aid Committee announced that a Belgian
doctor helping Palestinians in south Lebanon disappeared four days
ago after leaving his base at the Rashidiyeh refugee camp, two
miles south of the port of Tyre.
   A statement released by the committee said Dr. Jan Cools, 32,
disappeared at 2 p.m. Saturday. Coots, a general practitioner, has
been on a voluntary mission in Lebanon since February. No group has
claimed kidnapping him.
   Fears for the 18 confirmed hostages, including nine Americans,
have been roused by almost three weeks of fighting between
Iranian-backed fundamentalists and pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem
militiamen in Beirut's southern slums.
   Most of the kidnapped foreigners in Lebanon are believed held in
the embattled slums by extremist factions affiliated with
Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main ally in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah's fighters have seized control of 95 percent of the
slums in the fighting with Justice Minister Nabih Berri's
Syrian-armed Amal militia.
   Police say 296 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded since
the hostilities broke out May 6.
   They said Hezbollah appeared to be marshaling its forces today
for a push into the sprawling Shiyah district to flush out Amal
from its last remaining stronghold in the slums.
   Sporadic shell blasts resounded across Beirut this morning, but
police said no new casualties have been reported from the slums war.
   Syria has 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles
massed in hills and dunes surrounding the slums, a warren of 16
square miles of narrow alleyways and cement-block shanties.
   But a dispute with Iran over ways of ending the fighting has
delayed a Syrian push into the slums.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, apparently alarmed by
Hezbollah's triumph, traveled to Damascus today. Several Beirut
radio stations said he would officially request Syria's military
intervention to halt the slums war.
   ``Hezbollah's expansion heralds the fall of west Beirut,''
warned a front-page headline in the conservative Beirut newspaper
Al-Anwar.
   West Beirut has a predominantly Sunni Moslem population. Sunnis
generally reject Iranian patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
brand of Islamic fundamentalism.
   Syria has another army contingent of 7,500 troops in charge of
west Beirut's security. That force was sent on Feb. 22, 1987 at the
request of Lebanese Moslem government leaders to curb militia
anarchy in the capital's Moslem sector.
   Hoss, a Sunni, went immediately upon his arrival in Damascus
into a closed-door conference with Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam, that nation's top expert on Lebanese affairs.
   Police said Tuesday that Hezbollah fighters had mopped up the
last pockets of Amal resistance in the southern suburb of Ghobeiri
in house-to-house combat.
   Beirut radio stations said three Syrian soldiers were killed by
a stray shell that slammed into their checkpoint on the airport
highway on Tuesday. Police and the Syrian command refused to
comment on the report.
   No clear word on the fate of the hostages has emerged since the
fight for the Shiite slums began.
   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Two Plead in Howard Beach Case; Five Defendants Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five defendants remain in the second Howard
Beach racial attack trial after two young men pleaded guilty to
riot charges _ one of them in a secret hearing made public by an
appeals court.
   Salvatore DeSimone, 20, entered his plea Tuesday before jury
selection resumed for the remaining defendants in the case, in
which a black man was beaten and another was chased to his death in
front of a car by a gang of whites.
   After DeSimone's plea, state Supreme Court Justice Thomas
Demakos unsealed transcripts of a May 19 hearing that revealed
Harry Buonocore, 19, also pleaded guilty to riot.
   Under the plea bargains, Buonocore and DeSimone will receive
five years' probation and 200 hours of community service. The riot
charge is punishable by up to four years in prison.
   Four of the five remaining defendants face riot charges in the
case; the fifth also is charged with attempted murder and assault.
   In the first trial last year, three young men were convicted of
manslaughter. A fourth was acquitted of all charges.
   Under his plea, Buonocore may testify against the remaining
defendants. DeSimone's plea ensures he will not have to, said his
lawyer, Augustus Agate.
   The plea bargains surprised one of the remaining defendants,
John Saggese, who reasserted his innocence.
   ``I'm not guilty of riot,'' Saggese said. ``I don't think Sal is
guilty. I couldn't have done it. I don't think anyone should have
plea-bargained at all.''
   DeSimone also pleaded guilty to criminal facilitation for
driving members of a white gang to the confrontation with three
blacks in 1986. The melee in the city's Howard Beach section left
23-year-old Michael Griffith dead.
   Buonocore's plea was entered at a secret proceeding before
Demakos. On Monday, a four-judge state appellate panel ruled
unanimously in favor of a motion by The New York Times to unseal
the transcript.
   The panel said Demakos is prohibited from excluding the news
media and public from any future plea proceedings in the case.
   Buonocore's attorney, Edward M. Rappaport, was in court Tuesday
and unavailable for comment on whether his client would testify.

   The School Board has barred its members from
taking chauffeur-driven cars at taxpayer expense, averting a
threatened cutoff of $30 million in state money.
   Clara Rutherford and Rose Mary Osborne, who had refused to join
fellow board members in giving up chauffeur-driven cars to take
them to and from evening meetings, were silent in the voice vote
Tuesday night.
   The decision came two weeks after state Treasurer Robert Bowman
said he would withhold the money from the school district, which
has a deficit of more than $60 million, unless Rutherford and
Osborne relented.
   School officials said earlier the district would fail to meet
its May 31 payroll without the money.
   Bowman said the $30 million should be available by Friday.
   The 11-member board has been criticized for using chauffeurs
despite financial problems. The district cut $16 million from its
budget last year and plans to eliminate 515 jobs in the fall and
close 13 school buildings within two years.
   Osborne had maintained that female board members need chauffeurs
for protection when traveling to and from evening meetings. She
also said she had poor night vision and couldn't drive safely.
   A survey showed the district paid about $500,000 in salaries,
overtime and bonuses to 12 drivers assigned to the board in 1986
and the first five months of 1987.
   Board members receive $30 for each meeting they attend. They are
also reimbursed for expenses.

<HEAD>Beijing Follows Other Cities, Cancels Beauty Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing's first beauty contest has been called
off because such pageantry would be unsuitable when so many people
are living in poverty, organizers said today.
   The cancellation came after other cities across China called off
scheduled beauty pageants.
   ``In Beijing, conditions for such an event are not ripe,'' said
Long Xinmin, head of Beijing Television Studio, one of the
scheduled sponsors. He cited China's low standard of living.
   Shanghai scrapped its ``Shanghai Maiden'' contest two weeks ago,
also saying that ``conditions are not ripe.''
   Long said Beijing's decision was not influenced by the other
cancellations.
   The Beijing contest to select 10 ``Girls of Youth and Elegance''
entered the semifinals last week. The 10 winners were to have been
selected in early June.
   The event, open to Beijing women between the ages of 17 and 27,
drew 842 applicants. The field was narrowed down to 50 contestants
after two stages.
   Foreign reporters were barred from attending preliminary events
and were told they could only cover the finals. They also were
barred from China's first beauty pageant since the 1949 communist
victory, apparently because of fears of negative publicity. That
pageant was in Canton in 1985.
   After Beijing announced its pageant plans in April, at least
half a dozen cities also held local beauty contests.
   Kunming, Yunnan province, was the first to finish, selecting its
``Miss Spring City'' in early May.
   But beauty contest plans in other cities met with disapproval
from many people who said such events were improper when many
people in China are living in poverty.
   Newspaper commentators in Shanghai said the city was facing
economic and other problems that require ``leaders and the 12
million city residents to be of one heart and one mind and to
quietly immerse themselves in hard work. It is premature to spend
450,00 yuan ($126,000) on a beauty pageant.''
   Miss ``Empress Cup'' of the coastal province of Fujian will be
awarded 15,000 yuan, or $4,054, worth of prizes. That's the
equivalent of 10 years' pay for the average Chinese worker.
   Supporters of the pageants argue that the events would educate
people on the correct standards of beauty and help raise awareness
of grooming and manners.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan still hopes for a
strategic missile treaty with the Soviet Union and says there may
be a fifth summit with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
according to a newspaper report made available today.
   The conservative newspaper Die Welt also said Reagan is urging
other NATO member nations to pick up more of the Western alliance's
defense costs.
   Die Welt said the interview was conducted shortly before Reagan
departed for the upcoming summit in Moscow. It said the interview
would appear in its Thursday editions but sent it by telex in
advance to other news media.
   ``President Ronald Reagan figures that the START treaty, which
foresees the halving of nuclear intercontinental missiles, still
can be brought to completion before the end of his term,'' the
Bonn-based newspaper said.
   Die Welt did not provide a direct quote from Reagan regarding
his hopes for such a treaty.
   Reagan told Die Welt and four other European newspapers that the
Soviets also are interested in reaching an intercontinental missile
treaty with him, rather than waiting for his successor.
   ``Therefore, the president doesn't exclude the possibility of a
fifth summit conference with Gorbachev this year on neutral
ground,'' the newspaper said, again without providing a direct
quote.
   The Moscow summit starting Sunday with be the fourth meeting
between the two leaders. Reagan met with Gorbachev in Geneva in
November 1985; Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986; and Washington
in December 1987.
   In his interview, Reagan also urged other NATO members to pick
up more of the expenses for maintaining military defense forces of
the alliance.
   ``I don't think this is an area that should cause bad blood
between us,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying. ``But it would be
helpful if the allies would carry more of the load, especially
since the American Congress for years has declined to approve
further increases for defense.''
   Reagan's quotes were provided in German and translated by The
Associated Press.
   Reagan also said it was good that Gorbachev's program of
Glasnost, or more openness, is being practiced in other communist
nations, the newspaper reported.
   Referring to his relationship with Gorbachev, Reagan was quoted
by Die Welt as saying: ``We can discuss delicate issues without
lingering personal bad feelings. I believe there is actually a
certain degree of friendship between us.''

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania today denied that it sold Israel
heavy water, which can be used in the production of nuclear weapons.
   The Norwegian Foreign Ministry had asked Romania whether it
re-exported 12{ tons of Norwegian heavy water in violation of its
sales contract, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   Romania's official Agerpress news agency, monitored in Vienna,
said the Hungarian Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag and Hungarian
radio and television, in a ``false report,'' had accused Romania of
selling the water to Israel.
   The Oslo newspapers Verdens Gang and Arbeiderbladet also said
last week that Romania may have resold the material to Israel.
   ``The Romanian news agency is empowered to deny this piece of
information and to state that never did Romania sell heavy water to
Israel,'' Agerpress said.
   In Oslo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lasse Seim said Romania's
charge d'affaires was summoned to the ministry Tuesday and asked to
convey Norway's query about the reported resale to the Romanian
government.
   A precondition of the Norwegian sale in 1986 was that the heavy
water be used only for a planned Romanian nuclear power project,
which has not yet begun.
   Norway sold 21 tons of heavy water directly to Israel in 1959
and is now demanding the right to inspect Israeli nuclear
facilities to ensure that the material is being used for peaceful
purposes. Israel refuses all foreign inspections.
   For the second time in four weeks, Oslo newspapers have raised
questions about the possible diversion of Norwegian heavy water
without Norway's knowledge.
   A government investigation confirmed an April 21 report in
Verdens Gang that 15 tons of heavy water was sent to an unknown
destination in 1983 by a West German firm.
   Norway requested a criminal investigation by West Germany.
   A Duesseldorf prosecutor replied on May 5 that the international
transport of the heavy water was not illegal under West German laws
regulating the nuclear industry because heavy water is not
radioactive material.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used to cool nuclear power
reactors by slowing the speed of neutrons released in a chain
reaction. It enables reactors to run on natural uranium instead of
enriched uranium fuel, and it may be used to produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons.
   Norsk Hydro, Norway's only producer of heavy water, has denied
breaking export rules.

<HEAD>China Denies Sharing Military Technology with Argentina, Pakistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today issued a series of denials about its
activities on the world arms market, including reports that it
helped Pakistan launch a missile and that it agreed to share
technology for missile production with Argentina.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing denied reports that
Chinese leaders agreed to supply Argentina with technology for
producing anti-ship and medium-range missiles capable of hitting
the Falkland Islands.
   In 1982, Argentina lost a war to Britain over the islands, which
it calls the Malvinas.
   A report in The Sunday Times in London said China and Argentina
signed a secret agreement during President Raul Alfonsin's visit to
China last week. It said the agreement was for cooperation rather
than sale of missiles and that China in return would receive access
to Argentine research stations.
   Li said no such agreement was discussed.
   He also denied reports that China helped Pakistan test fire a
missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
   ``The allegation about China's assistance in Pakistan's
launching of a medium-range missile is utterly groundless,'' Li
said of a report that appeared in The New York Times on Tuesday.
   It said Pakistan launched a missile April 25 that was produced
with the help of Chinese experts and that is capable of reaching
the Indian cities of Bombay and New Delhi.
   Li also called ``groundless'' news reports that Israel helped
develop Chinese ground-to-ground missiles sold to Saudi Arabia.
   On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Shamir also denied
the Washington Post report that said Israeli scientists improved
the guidance systems of the Chinese CSS-2 medium-range missile
deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   Li said he knew nothing about a report in the British
publication, Jane's Defense Weekly, that China had sold mine
sweepers to Thailand and agreed to sell submarines.
   China last spring sold tanks, armored personel carriers and
small arms to Thailand reportedly valued at $10 million.
   Li also denied a report in the U.S. media that China helped the
United States obtain Soviet weapons from Afghanistan for study by
the Defense Department.
   China has become a major arms supplier to Third World countries.
According to some estimates, China is the fifth largest seller of
arms in the world behind the Soviet Union., United States, Britain
and France.
   China has been a major supplier of arms to both Iran and Iraq in
their nearly 8-year-old war.

   An East German man today slipped

Germany, Bavarian authorities said.
   The man, identified only as a 27-year-old laborer, apparently
was not seen by armed communist guards who regularly patrol the
border separating the two German states. He was uninjured, state
police said.
   No other details were released on the flight, the fifth into

recently died trying to escape to West Germany.
   The statement said one tried Monday to ram his car through a
steel gate at the Helmstedt checkpoint in East Germany. Authorities
last week found the body of another man who had apparently drowned
while trying to swim five miles across Luebeck Bay to West Germany,
the statement said.

   President Reagan left today for his fourth
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, extolling
advancements in superpower relations but pledging ``to go still
farther'' in the interests of freedom and peace.
   ``We have many differences _ deep differences, moral
differences,'' Reagan told a White House departure ceremony minutes
before he left for the Moscow summit, which begins Sunday and ends
four days later.
   ``But we are still fellow human beings. We can still work
together to keep the peace. And in working with the Soviet Union,
the United States can still remain true to its mission (of)
expanding liberty throughout the world,'' Reagan said.
   Several hundred people were escorted onto the South Lawn of the
White House to witness Reagan's departure remarks. Under a steady
rain, Reagan spoke as an aide held a black umbrella over him. First
lady Nancy Reagan stood next to the president, sheltered from the
rain by an umbrella held by a second aide.
   But the umbrella failed to keep the president dry. His wife was
overheard remarking to Reagan, ``Honey, you're just soaked.''
   He answered, ``I know it.'' She then asked, ``Why didn't you put
on a raincoat?'' His answer was not overheard.
   A military band had played patriotic marches as the Reagans
emerged from the Diplomatic Entrance. Among those in the large
crowd standing by were several members of the Cabinet and Soviet
ambassador Yuri Dubynin.
   As the brief ceremony ended, the Navy's Blue Angels precison
flight team staged a low-altitude fly-by.
   Before leaving for a stopover in Helsinki, Finland, the
president asked for the prayers of Americans ``as I embark on this
great task.''
   ``Since my first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, ... we have come a
long way,'' Reagan said. ``My task in the next week will be to go
still farther, farther in the interests of peace. Farther toward a
universal respect for fundamental human rights. Farther toward
world freedom. Farther toward a safer world for all people,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan was leaving without a ratified U.S.-Soviet treaty banning
medium-range nuclear missiles, the highlight of his last summit in
December with Gorbachev.
   The pact is still awaiting Senate approval and White House chief
of staff Howard Baker is staying behind in the hope the Senate may
act and the treaty can be rushed to Reagan before he meets with
Gorbachev.
   Several of Reagan's own conservative colleagues have stalled
action on the pact, arguing it is one-sided and does not address
concerns about potential Soviet cheating.
   But Senate leaders moved Tuesday to halt debate.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told Reagan on Tuesday that ``in all
likelihood, the Senate will be able to act on the treaty by
Friday.''
   The president, summing up his four-part agenda for the May
29-June 2 talks with the Soviet general secretary, noted in his
departure remarks that he and Gorbachev have ``plenty of work'' to
do.
   ``I do not expect it to be easy,'' Reagan said.
   _On arms control, Reagan lauded the pact banning medium-range
missiles for reducing the level of superpower arsenals for the
first time. Progress has been made on a second pact to slash
strategic weapons by half, he said, adding that he intended ``to
resolve the issues that still stand in the way.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz held out the hope Tuesday
that the strategic arms treaty can be completed before Reagan
leaves office in January.
   _On human rights, Reagan lauded Soviet advancements such as the
loosening of emigration restraints and the release of political
prisoners, Reagan said he intended to ``see that the positive
trends ... continue and the reforms are made permanent.''
   _On regional issues, Reagan noted that the two countries have
signed the Geneva accords outlining the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan and that the first withdrawals have begun. But he
said he would be looking for Soviet actions to help advance
negotiations on problems in Angola and Namibia and ``to support
U.N. efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war.''
   _On bilateral ties, Reagan pledged to extend the areas of
cooperation. ``This will include everything from practical matters
of nuclear safety to radio navigation and the protection of the
global environment,'' he said.
   Reagan said his goal throughout his meetings with Gorbachev,
which began in Geneva in 1985, has been to establish ``a better
working relationship with the Soviet Union, one no longer subject
to the dangerous highs and lows of the past, a working relationship
based on realities, not merely on a seeming relaxation of tensions.
...''
   ``In my talks with General Secretary Gorbachev next week, we
will be looking to the future, for there remains much to be done,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to sign some minor agreements
on cultural programs, fishing, civilian nuclear reactor safety,
transportation technologies and a packet of understandings on Coast
Guard-maritime issues, according to Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway.
   The visit marks the first time the 77-year-old Reagan sets foot
in the nation he once derided as ``the Evil Empire.'' It also is
the first time in 14 years an American commander-in-chief has
visited Moscow. The last trip was made by then-President Nixon in
June 1974.
   Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Helsinki in the pre-dawn hours
of Thursday. He will remain there until Sunday morning, when he
boards Air Force One for the 1{-hour trip to Moscow.
   Almost immediately after his arrival, Reagan and Gorbachev are
scheduled to begin their fourth summit in 30 months.
   Shultz said Tuesday that the United States will make new
proposals at the summit to help solve the problem of keeping track
of mobile missiles, one of the key obstacles to a new U.S.-Soviet
treaty on strategic weapons.
   The secretary said the administration would also pursue a system
for sending observers to suspect sites with little advance warning.
   In a speech broadcast in Europe on Tuesday, Reagan said he does
not expect to achieve ``a quick, radical transformation of the
Soviet system.''
   ``There still remain profound political and moral differences
between the Soviet system and our own.''
   The president said he hopes to reach an agreement on strategic
nuclear weapons ``this year _ though it is the requirements of a
good treaty and not some arbitrary deadline that will determine the
timetable.''
   The president's remarks were broadcast overseas on the U.S.
Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech was
taped Monday in the Oval Office.

<HEAD>Administration Discussed Plan to Abduct Terrorist Ringleader</HEAD>

   The Reagan administration discussed a plan in
1985 to send agents to France to abduct the reputed ringleader of
the group holding American hostages in the Middle East, but
rejected the proposal out of fear it would anger the French
government, a U.S. official said today.
   American intelligence had received word that Imad Mugniyeh, a
Lebanese Shiite linked to terrorist attacks, was visiting France
and some members of the administration advocated seizing Mugniyeh
and bringing him to the United States for trial, said the official.
   The State Department, fearing an abduction would cause a major
blowup in U.S.-French relations, shot down the proposal, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Instead, French officials were asked to arrest Mugniyeh, but
they did not act on the request, said the official.
   National Public Radio, which first reported the proposal, said
in a report broadcast today that the plan was conceived by William
Casey, then director of Central Intelligence.
   NPR reported that it was never completely proven that Mugniyeh
was in France at the time his abduction was proposed. In early
1986, following new reports of Mugniyeh's presence in France, local
authorities did act on the U.S. request and went to a hotel to
arrest him.
   Instead of finding a Lebanese terrorist, police found a family
of vacationers, NPR reported.
   Mugniyeh has been identified by U.S. terrorism experts as the
leader of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group held responsible
for the kidnapping of nine Americans and other westerners in
Lebanon.
   He is under indictment in the United States on charges of
participating in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the
killing of Navy diver Robert Stethem, one of the passengers.
   The U.S. official who spoke of the proposal to abduct Mugniyeh
said ``there's always a lot of brainstorming about this sort of
thing. It was an idea that was floated. People were saying `how can
we do this'?''
   ``It didn't get to the top level,'' he said.
   ``The State Department felt strongly that if something like this
was to be done it could not be through secret connivance; there had
to be a decision by French political authorities to arrest him and
turn him over to the United States,'' he said.

   For almost four months, an elderly widow was kept
``doped up'' and barred from contact with the outside world by a
couple authorities say bilked her out of more than $100,000 in
savings.
   One day, however, Lucille Knight managed to slip a note to
relatives 500 miles away in Hammond, La., and a sheriff's deputy
eventually rescued her from the Ringgold, Ga., house that was her
prison.
   Mrs. Knight went back to the Hammond trailer where she was
kidnapped and waited for word that her tormenters had been caught.
Now, almost two years later, a Georgia couple has been charged with
federal fraud, kidnapping and conspiracy.
   Terry Lee Barrett, 29, and Alice Virginia Barrett, 31, were
indicted May 10 by a federal grand jury in Atlanta, U.S. Attorney
Robert Barr said Tuesday. They surrendered Friday in Tickfaw, La.,
and are being held on $100,000 bond.
   ``They destroyed everything I had,'' the 83-year-old Mrs. Knight
said Tuesday in a telephone interview from her Hammond home. ``They
kept me doped up most all the time I was there. I couldn't stand
up; I couldn't walk; I couldn't do anything.''
   The widow's ordeal began Feb. 3, 1986, when a couple she barely
knew came to her trailer park home in Hammond. She says she woke up
three days later in Ringgold.
   Mrs. Knight said she had met Mrs. Barrett only once, on a visit
the previous Christmas to Ringgold, where Mrs. Barrett had cared
for Mrs. Knight's brother, Everett Joiner, for several years.
   Larry Black, then captain of detectives for the Catoosa County
Sheriff's Department, said Tuesday that Mrs. Knight's neighbors
remembered seeing her carried from her mobile home, but friends or
relatives who would call to check on her were told she was sick, or
at the doctor's.
   Louisiana authorities apparently were reluctant to pursue the
case, believing it was a domestic dispute rather than a kidnapping,
Black said.
   Mrs. Knight said that one day she finally managed to get her
brother to mail a letter to her niece, Barbara Wittie, in Louisiana.
   ``He took it out to the end of the driveway, waited for the
mailman, bought a stamp from him and got him to mail it,'' Mrs.
Knight said.
   The letter brought her niece to Black, who said he went to the
house on June 5, found Mrs. Knight and ``told her that her
relatives were here and asked her if she was OK.''
   Eventually, he said, he took her to his patrol car because she
was obviously in ill health and frightened. He later notified the
FBI.
   Black said he returned to the house a week later and the
Barretts had left. He believes they traveled to St. Louis, Virginia
and back to Louisiana.
   The indictment claims the Barretts stole $101,875.72 in all,
depositing the money in a Chattanooga, Tenn., bank in the name of
Barrett Bakery and Barrett's Cajun Bakery and Deli.
   It alleges they forged Mrs. Knight's signature on Social
Security and retirement checks from California, and gained access
to her savings accounts, using the money for their own purposes.
   The Barretts administered Valium, Quaaludes, Percodan and
laxatives to keep Mrs. Knight under control, according to the
indictment.
   ``I didn't know they had taken everything I had'' until Black
rescued her, Mrs. Knight said. She has been living in Hammond ever
since, and said she has suffered no lingering effects from the
drugs.
   At the time of the rescue, Black said, he asked Joiner if he
wanted to leave, but he refused. Joiner has since died and is not
mentioned in the indictment.
   Mrs. Knight's niece said that Joiner had given Mrs. Barrett his
power of attorney and may also have been under the influence of the
couple, the Constitution reported today.
   If convicted, the Barretts could be sentenced to life in prison
and fined $2 million. Barr said they will be arraigned in Rome,
Ga., in a few days.

   Vice President George Bush today accused
a ``liberal elite'' of seeking to undermine U.S. defense and said
that while he was encouraged by the upcoming superpower summit,
``we cannot wish away the Soviet Union as a competitor.''
   The Republican presidential contender, addressing a graduation
ceremony at the U.S. Military Academy, said the times require
leadership that ``will pursue negotiations with the Soviet
realistically.''
   Standing in a pouring rain during the outdoor ceremony, Bush
told the graduating cadets that summits such as the one in Moscow
beginning this weekend ``are good in and of themselves, for they
contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity.''
   However, Bush said Americans must not become too complacent
about a Soviet threat just because the two sides are talking.
   In what was billed by his aides as a non-political speech, Bush
lashed out at liberals.
   However, he praised the late President John F. Kennedy for
standing firm against the Soviets in Cuba, saying that Kennedy's
acts were in line with a bipartisan consensus on dealing with the
Soviets that had prevailed from the 1940s.
   ``But by the '70s the consensus had fractured, splintered, the
center did not hold,'' Bush said.
   ``The liberal elite do not understand, they never understood,
the common sense behind'' the former approach to the Soviets, Bush
told the graduating cadets.
   ``They are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what
Americans have understood for 40 years: that peace flows from
strength,'' he said.
   Bush said that such people, whom he did not identify, ``will
make the world more dangerous.''
   The vice president addressed the graduating class of 849 men and
90 women.
   Bush was campaigning later today in New Jersey, then was heading
to his oceanfront vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. While
Reagan is in Moscow, Bush is to spend the next week meeting with
advisers and Republican leaders with an eye to sharpening his
strategy for the fall campaign.
   Republican advisers in recent days, mindful of recent polls
showing Bush trailing Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis, have
urged the candidate to come up with more specifics on campaign
issues that will help to separate him from the administration's
recent problems.
   His aides are portraying the Maine visit as low-profile and say
they expect the vice president to do more listening than newsmaking
while the public spotlight is on the Moscow summit.
   During the time in Kennebunkport, Bush will ``be meeting with
(Republican) governors, senators, congressmen, people with
expertise in economic and domestic affairs,'' said campaign
spokesman Peter Teeley.
   ``Basically, he'll be discussing issues, and looking at these
issues in relation to the general election.''
   Despite his continued efforts to identify himself with
accomplishments of the Reagan administration, Bush in recent weeks
has staked out his own stands apart from Reagan's on issues ranging
from education to day care and the environment.
   He has also put some distance between himself and the
administration's efforts to strike a deal with Panamanian military
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, including the possibility of
dropping drug charges in exchange for his relinquishing of power.
   Bush has said that, if elected, he would not negotiate with drug
traffickers. And aides said Bush privately has urged that talks
with Noriega be broken off.
   On Tuesday, House Republicans met for 90 minutes with top Bush
campaign officials. Participants said Bush was applauded at the
meeting for differing with Reagan on Noriega.
   ``It's a very symbolic circumstance, where Bush has moved from
being vice president to being his own candidate,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach of Iowa.
   ``Almost to a person they were pleased about the separation on
Noriega,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois.
   Bush's poor showing in recent polls, showing he was behind
Dukakis in a hypothetical fall matchup by margins ranging from 7 to
16 percentage points, was also discussed at the session, according
to participants.
   ``We have bad polls. If this were October we'd be suicidal. But
it's May,'' Martin said. But, she added, ``There wasn't anybody up
screaming, `My God, we've got the Titanic.' The seas are rough.''
   The Republican lawmakers met with Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign
manager; Craig Fuller, the vice president's chief of staff, and
pollster Robert Teeter.
   Teeter shrugged off the recent polls and said he told the House
members ``we're in a very artificial period, that period when
Dukakis has been rolling along. What you got to do is get past this
California primary before people begin to focus on it (the
presidential race).''
   California and New Jersey both hold primaries on June 7.
   After speaking in West Point, Bush was to speak to a group of
senior citizens in Lakewood, N.J., and attend a GOP rally in Jersey
City.
   On Thursday, he planned several campaign stops in the Newark
area before heading to Maine.

   A flight mechanic without a pilot's license stole
a private jet in Virginia early today and took it on a 1,600-mile
joyride to Denver, where he shot himself as authorities closed in,
officials said.
   ``The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for a
while,'' said Richard Boulware, spokesman for Stapleton
International Airport.
   Denver police, FBI agents and emergency vehicles were waiting at
the edge of a runway at the airport when the twin-engine Learjet 36
came to a stop in a landing an airport spokesman said appeared to
be that of a proficient pilot.
   ``As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he
was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said Boulware. ``They heard a
noise and when they looked in the cockpit they found him dead.
Things happened really fast.''
   The man, Mike Christiansen, 24, of Newport News, Va., was alone
in the jet stolen from his employer, Flight International, at
Patrick Henry International Airport in Newport News, where the
plane sideswiped a security van as it took off, said airport
spokesman Pete Daikos.
   ``We're not sure whether he had a gun when he started, but when
he landed he was surrounded and he shot himself, shot and killed
himself,'' said Dick Stafford, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman in Washington.
   Daikos said at a news conference in Newport News that
Christiansen had been a flight mechanic at Flight International
since March. He said Christiansen did not have a pilot's license.
   ``This is bizarre,'' Boulware said. ``Rarely do you find someone
stealing a plane like this worth millions of dollars.''
   ``This guy obviously was a proficient pilot,'' he said. ``He
made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no
damage to the plane or the runway.''
   Daikos said the man is believed to be a former resident of the
Denver area. No one saw him armed, he said.
   Atlanta-based Flight International performs ground services for
corporate aircraft and airlines and operates the world's largest
fleet of Learjets, Daikos said.
   Daikos said Flight International also ``is a major contractor
with the armed forces to test defense mechanisms by challenging
them.'' He said some of the Learjets have classified electronic
gear, but the stolen plane was not believed to be so equipped.
   Gordon James, executive vice president of Flight International,
confirmed that the man was an employee but refused further comment.
   John Hill of the Peninsula Airport Commission security staff,
which oversees the Newport News airport, reported receiving a call
about 2:15 a.m. from a guard who told him an aircraft was being
stolen, Daikos said.
   Hill drove onto the runway in a van and got out, Daikos said.
The airplane apparently hit the van, damaging the driver's side and
leaving what appeared to be part of a wingtip fuel tank on the
runway, Daikos said. No one was injured.
   Air traffic controllers at several airports had tracked the
plane for parts of the flight across the country, Stafford said.
Controllers in Longmont picked up the plane over Colorado Springs,
south of Denver, according to Boulware.
   The jet landed at 5:18 a.m.
   ``We got an experienced Lear 36 pilot up in the Stapleton
control tower and he managed to talk him down into a good
landing,'' Boulware said.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, the Learjet has a
flight range of about 1,640 miles when carrying four passengers and
a full load of fuel.
   Flight experts here said the Learjet 36 is designed to seat two
crew members and 11 passengers, although Boulware said this plane
could seat six or seven passengers.
   Boulware said the plane was picked up at 39,000 feet. He said
the Learjet cruises at about 500 mph.

   Maria Esther Chavez said doctors told her
she would probably have twins. She delivered quintuplets.
   Mrs. Chavez gave birth to three boys and two girls by Caesarean
section early Tuesday at McAllen Medical Center.
   ``They told me two,'' the surprised mother said Tuesday in
Spanish.
   The babies, whom hospital officials were calling ``Babies A
through E,'' were listed in stable condition this morning. Their
weight ranged from two pounds, three ounces to three pounds, said
hospital spokeswoman Nelda Hernandez.
   ``They're fine, thanks to God,'' said Mrs. Chavez, a 28-year-old
resident of Reynosa, Mexico. Her 41-year-old husband, Baldemar
Chavez, was working in Mexico and could not be reached for comment.
   She was visiting her parents in the Lower Rio Grande Valley city
of Pharr on Monday when she went into labor, said Dr. John Garcia,
the attending physician.
   ``We delivered both and then I said, `Wait everybody, here's
another one,''' Garcia said, adding that neonatologist Ramiro
Caballero ``let out an exclamation point which I will not repeat.''
   ``And then we told him we had four, then we had five and it was
really exciting,'' Garcia said.
   Garcia, who had examined Mrs. Chavez three times before, had
told her she probably would have twins. She had not taken fertility
drugs, which often are associated with multiple births, he said.
   ``A few years back, these babies would have had a poor chance of
survival, but now with the neonatology advances, these babies have
an excellent chance,'' Garcia said.
   Mrs. Chavez said she and her husband have one other child, a
4-year-old girl.
   Asked if she planned to have any more children, she answered
with an emphatic, ``No.''

   Vice President George Bush today accused a ``liberal elite'' of
chipping away at a national consensus that the United States must
deal from strength in approaching the Soviet Union. Democratic
presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis reaped endorsements on
Capitol Hill before flying west for a debate with Jesse Jackson.
   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, used the
graduation ceremony at West Point to say that the 1980s require
leadership that ``will pursue negotiations with the Soviet
realistically.''
   Speaking as President Reagan was leaving for the Moscow summit,
Bush said such superpower meetings ``are good in and of themselves,
for they contribute to an atmosphere of peace and familiarity.''
However, he added, ``We cannot wish away the Soviet Union as a
competitor.''
   Without naming names, he said, ``The liberal elite do not
understand, they never understood, the common sense behind'' what
he said was a former consensus on dealing with the Soviet Union.
``They are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what
Americans have understood for 40 years: that peace flows from
strength,'' he told the graduating cadets.
   One day earlier, Bush picked up what could prove to be an
unwelcome piece of baggage on the campaign trail _ Reagan's veto of
a big trade bill.
   Dukakis, who has frequently criticized the expected veto, said
today at the Capitol that it was ``a tragedy'' for Reagan to take
such action because of a provision requiring companies to give 60
days notice to workers before closing a plant.
   On a happier note for Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be cruised
to an easy victory in Idaho's presidential primary on Tuesday. He
was picking up 15 of the 18 national convention delegates, as
Dukakis won a non-binding Democratic ``beauty contest'' with no
delegates at stake.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Dukakis was taking
73 percent to Jackson's 16 percent in Idaho, while Bush was gaining
82 percent to 9 percent for Pat Robertson, who suspended his
presidential bid earlier this month.
   Robertson was winning one delegate, with two going to the
uncommitted column. Bush already has more delegates than he needs
for the GOP nomination.
   In Washington, Dukakis picked up endorsements from more than a
dozen members of Congress and met privately with former rival
Albert Gore Jr.
   Dukakis' talk with Gore resulted in no endorsement, but ``it was
a good, friendly meeting,'' Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said of
the session. He said the two men met alone in Dukakis' hotel room.
   Bush left Washington to spend a week at his summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine. After speaking to the graduating cadets at
West Point, he was expected to keep a low profile to avoid
upstaging Reagan during the Moscow summit.
   Tonight's Jackson-Dukakis debate in San Francisco comes as the
two campaign for California's June 7 primary. Candidates' debates
were almost painfully commonplace earlier in the campaign, as the
the-crowded Democratic field met frequently for talkfests.
   But the last time Jackson and Dukakis met for a debate was in
April, prior to the Pennsylvania primary. Back then, the two were
exchanging mainly pleasantries. But Jackson has been more critical
of Dukakis in recent weeks as the delegate gap between the two
widened.
   Dukakis is now within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates
needed to nominate. He has 1,680 to Jackson's 983, according to the
latest Associated Press count.
   On Tuesday, Dukakis denounced Reagan's veto of the trade
measure, which would require advance notice of plant closings.
   ``Any administration that is willing to give Gen. (Manuel
Antonio) Noriega 120 days notice and a plea bargain ought to be
willing to give the American worker 60 days notice before they are
thrown out on the street,'' the Massachusetts governor said,
referring to talks aimed at easing the Panamanian military leader
from power. Noriega is under indictment on drug charges.
   Dukakis made it clear the plant-closing issue would be used as
ammunition in his expected campaign against the vice president.
Reagan and Bush, he said, ``don't understand that for working
families ... there is nothing more painful than losing a job.''
   Even some Bush backers broke with the administration on the
trade bill. Rep. Guy Molinari, Bush's New York campaign chairman,
was one of 60 House Republicans who joined in the 308-113 vote to
override the veto. Senate Democratic leaders have said they expect
the veto to stand in their chamber.
   Bush has not come out directly in favor of the president's
position, but he hasn't publicly dissented either.
   He has edged slightly away from Reagan by speaking favorably of
the plant-closing law in Massachusetts, Dukakis' home state. But
Bush has said that he approves of the Massachusetts measure because
it is voluntary, whereas the federal one would be mandatory.
   For the vice president, the trade bill was the latest example of
an administration action that has left him on the defensive as he
campaigns. In one such controversy _ the Noriega affair _ Bush let
it be known, if in cautious terms, that he disagreed with the
president.
   On Tuesday, at an anti-apartheid rally in Los Angeles, Jackson
renewed his call for South Africa to be designated a terrorist
state, and said he would push to include that in the party platform.
   Jackson also released a five-year budget plan this week calling
for a freeze in military spending. He underscored that idea on
Tuesday in a speech before a World Affairs Council luncheon in Los
Angeles, and said that he hoped it would also be reflected in the
platform.
   ``After the largest military buildup in our history, we must
change our course or lose our way,'' he told the group.

   Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen
today attacked three southern strongholds of pro-Iranian guerrillas
after Israeli jets, helicopters and artillery fired on the villages.
   A police spokesman said about 750 militiamen from the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army advanced toward the villages of
Soujud, Lowaizeh and Mleekh behind fierce shelling and air cover.
   The three villages, a few miles north of this market town just
outside Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, are traditional
strongholds of the Shiite Moslem extremist Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   Most of the villages' civilian populations had left after
Hezbollah started using them as bases for attacks against the South
Lebanon Army.
   Israeli helicopter gunships and jet fighters carried out at
least nine attacks against the three villages and surrounding hills
before the tank-led South Lebanon Army forces began a two-pronged
attack around dawn, the police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who by regulation cannot be identified, said
South Lebanon Army forces stormed through Hezbollah lines in the
villages of Lowaizeh and Mleekh and were advancing toward Soujud.
   South Lebanon Army fighters in Soviet-designed T-54 tanks
``overran Lowaizeh and are currently fighting Hezbollah's pockets
of resistance in Mleekh,'' he added.
   Another South Lebanon Army force, advancing behind a barrage of
Israeli howitzer fire, was engaged with Hezbollah fighters at the
southern entrance to Soujud, the spokesman said.
   Soujud is five miles north of Nabatiyeh and Lowaizeh is another
five miles northeast of Soujud. Mleekh is midway between the two
villages.
   The three villages are just one mile west of an South Lebanon
Army-held mountainous road connecting the town of Marjayoun in
Israel's security zone with the Christian town of Jezzine.
   Security sources in south Lebanon said the South Lebanon Army
attack came hours after Israel massed a mechanized force of about
600 troops in mountainous areas overlooking the battleground.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli
forces ``crossed into the security zone late Tuesday and drove to
the hill of Ali Taher and the village of Aishiyeh across
Marjayoun.''
   Ali Taher and Aishiyeh are along the South Lebanon
Army-controlled stretch of terrain connecting the security zone
with Jezzine.
   In Jerusalem today, Israel's armed forces chief of staff said
there was a danger of escalating clashes between Israel and the
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon.
   ``There is no doubt that when we attack Hezbollah there is a
danger, some threat of escalation, but we attack only those who
threaten us directly, and in this case, Hezbollah does provide a
direct threat,'' said Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron.
   He said Hezbollah guerrillas had used bases just north of the
security zone to launch attacks against Israel's northern border
and its forces in the zone.
   However, Israeli forces had limited their role to supporting the
South Lebanon Army in today's fighting, he said.
   Israel has maintained the 6-to-10-mile-deep security zone since
the summer of 1985, after withdrawing the bulk of its occupation
army from southern Lebanon. The South Lebanon Army-policed border
strip serves as a buffer against guerrilla attacks into northern
Israel.
   Hezbollah said its fighters were ``confronting'' the attack on
the three villages, and the police spokesman said the attacking
South Lebanon Army force was ``facing stiff resistance from
Hezbollah fighters in valleys around Mleekh and Soujud.''
   Hezbollah had earlier ordered its fighters to ``spread'' in the
valleys in an apparent effort to avoid suffering heavy casualties.
   Tank-led Israeli troops stormed through Hezbollah lines in the
Bekaa Valley's village of Maydoun on May 4. Israel said 40
Hezbollah fighters and three Israeli soldiers were killed in the
confrontation.
   Israel has launched nine previous air attacks into Lebanon this
year that killed 49 people and wounded 75, by police count.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
was hospitalized in intensive care because of chest pains,
officials said.
   Marcos, 70, was listed in guarded condition Tuesday night at St.
Francis Medical Center, and was undergoing tests, said Eugene N.
Tiwanak, the hospital's assistant administrator.
   He began suffering chest pains during the day. After an
hour-long interview with Allen Neuharth, chairman of the Gannett
newspaper group, Marcos continued to feel the pains. The family
consulted with Marcos' personal physician and it was decided he
should be taken to the hosital for a checkup, said Arturo Aruiza,
Marcos' chief spokesman.
   Marcos was taken to the hospital by car at about 8 p.m. Tuesday,
said Aruiza.
   There were unconfirmed reports Monday that Marcos' health was
deteriorating, but his spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad, said at the time
Marcos was healthy, although still grieving the death of his mother.
   ``He's admitted that he's feeling ill _ that he is not well,''
Aruiza said at the hospital.
   Also at the hospital was Marcos' wife, Imelda, who was wearing
her customary black dress and sunglasses.
   Mrs. Marcos left the hospital through a side door and appeared
to be escorted by four people. She told them, ``Thank you so much
for coming.''
   Asked if Marcos was going to be all right, she replied, ``Yes, I
think so. I hope so.''
   In the Philippines, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense
minister under Marcos, and Sen. Ernesto Maceda, who ran on Mrs.
Aquino's ticket but has since grown critical of her administration,
said Marcos should be allowed to return home.
   ``This is going to create another problem if (Marcos) comes home
in a box,'' Maceda said today. ``Now is the time for the government
to act and allow him to return.''
   Marcos was hospitalized briefly at St. Francis last October
during which a parathyroid gland was removed to ease chronic pain
in his legs, doctors said.
   Marcos, his wife and their three children have lived here since
fleeing the Philippines during the February 1986 civilian-military
revolution toppled him after 20 years in power.
   Marcos, who was first elected president in 1965, ruled the
Philippines with a mixture of dictatorship and democracy, reform
and stagnation.
   He was re-elected in 1969. In 1972, he declared martial law as
troops arrested scores of opponents, saying it was needed to save
the country from communism and to reform society. Marcos ruled with
an iron hand for the next eight years.
   He lifted martial law in January 1981 but gave up little of his
vast powers. A few weeks later, he won another term against a
little known candidate in an election that was boycotted by all his
major opponents.
   The beginning of the end for Marcos' reign came in 1983, when
his most powerful challenger, Benigno Aquino, was assassinated on
his return from exile in the United States. Opposition to Marcos
grew rapidly, and he scheduled an early election in February 1986
to prove his popularity.
   The Commission on Elections said Marcos won, but opponent
Corazon Aquino, Aquino's widow, charged the election was rigged and
also claimed victory.
   Later that month, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile broke with
Marcos. Soldiers, joined by hundreds of thousands of civilians,
rose up against Marcos, sweeping Mrs. Aquino to the presidency.
   Marcos' 95-year-old mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, died in the
Philippines on May 4. The family appealed to Mrs. Aquino to allow
Marcos to return for funeral but she refused, citing national
security.
   The body has been lying in state at a suburban Manila church,
where scores of Marcos supporters have been conducting a vigil
marked by calls for his return.

<HEAD>Key Figure Refuses to Testify at Hastings Impeachment Hearing</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Top 8 grafs new with Borders' appearance; picks up pvs 6th

<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington lawyer William A. Borders refused
to testify today at House impeachment proceedings against federal
Judge Alcee L. Hastings, and deprived investigators of eagerly
sought testimony by a crucial figure in an alleged bribery scheme.
   Borders, flanked by two lawyers, cited Fifth Amendment
guarantees against self-incrimination in refusing to answer any
questions by the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice,
which is studying impeachment charges against Hastings.
   Borders noted only that he was convicted in 1982 of arranging a
$150,000 bribe for Hastings from two Miami racketeers, was
sentenced to five years in prison and fined $35,000.
   He served 33 months in the Allenwood, Pa., federal prison and 27
months on parole, and was subsequently disbarred by the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals.
   ``I believe that my legal debt to society expired on May 22,
1988, after my release from parole,'' Borders said. ``I
respectfully refuse to answer any and all questions based on my ...
rights under the United States Constitution.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said
his panel would decidelater the ``very difficult'' question of
whether to grant Borders immunity from prosecution and compel his
testimony.
   Hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with Borders, who
is a close friend, to solicit a bribe from the two convicted
racketeers, Frank and Tom Romano, in exchange for a promise of
lenient sentences and return of a major portion of seized assets.
   Borders refused to testify at both his own and Hastings' trials.
He also refused to testify before a five-judge investigative panel
of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that was appointed
shortly after Hastings was acquitted.
   The judicial panel concluded there was ``clear and convincing
evidence'' that Hastings actually took part in a bribery scheme and
then attempted a cover-up by lying under oath and manufacturing
evidence at his trial.
   The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the Judicial
Conference of the United States, the chief policy-making body of
the federal judiciary, and forwarded to House leaders in March 1987
with the advice that ``consideration of impeachment may be
warranted.''
   Hastings, who continues to sit on the bench for the U.S.
District Court in Miami, insists he knew nothing of the bribery
scheme and accuses Borders of using his name to shake down the
Romano brothers.
   The House impeachment panel heard testimony on Tuesday from
linguistics expert Roger W. Shuy, who said a critical telephone
conversation between Hastings and Borders on Oct. 5, 1981, was
spoken in code, possibly in an attempt to disguise details of a
bribery plot.
   The phone call from Hastings in Miami to Borders in Washington
was secretly recorded by the FBI. One of its undercover agents,
posing as Frank Romano, already had delivered a $25,000 bribery
down payment to Borders.
   Hastings says the 29-second conversation concerned some letters
he had drafted to help another friend, Hemphill Pride of Columbia,
S.C., regain his lawyer's credentials after serving a prison term
for misappropriation of housing funds.
   Shuy, chairman of the linguistics department at Georgetown
University in Washington, said the recording ``indicates that
Borders and Hastings were using a code to convey information that
was not obvious to outsiders,'' both in their words and the
``structure of the dialogue.''
   Shuy refused to speculate what Hastings and Borders were really
discussing. But under questioning by House staff lawyers, he said
it was possible they were talking about bribe payments and concern
over whether Hastings should order the return of forfeited assets
seized from the Romanos.

<TEXT>
   The estate of Hallmark Cards' founder
owes the government more than $200 million in taxes, the Internal
Revenue Service says.
   If the IRS prevails in the case being heard this week in U.S.
Tax Court, the $131.5 million estate left by Joyce C. Hall could
become bankrupt.
   Hall died in 1982 and had earmarked his fortune for Kansas City
charities.
   The IRS contends that Hall's main asset, stock in Hallmark, was
sold by the estate at far below its market value. The IRS says an
accurate valuation is needed to establish the correct estate taxes
so the government gets its proper share.
   Hall's estate contends that the stock really has no market value
because the Kansas City greeting card maker is privately owned;
instead, the stock was sold for a price determined by an often-used
formula based on the adjusted book value of the stock.
   ``The estate is confident of its legal position,'' Hallmark
spokesman Charles W. Hucker said.

   The chief Senate opponent of the superpower
medium-range nuclear missile treaty said today ``I'm licked'' in
efforts to amend the agreement, apparently clearing the way for
approval before President Reagan begins his Moscow summit meeting.
   ``I'm licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty,'' said
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., as he sat down at a meeting with Senate
leaders to work out a procedural tangle that has stalled action on
the treaty for more than a week.
   The move raised hopes among treaty supporters that the pact
could be approved for ratification as soon as Friday, and forwarded
to Reagan by the time the summit begins on Sunday to give him a
stronger position in the talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and his Republican
counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, had filed petitions Tuesday
to limit debate and force it to a vote in time for the summit.
   ``I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty
Friday or Saturday,'' Byrd said. But he noted that potential
problems still exist, including competing items on the Senate's
legislative agenda, such as attempting to override President
Reagan's veto of a trade bill.
   Reagan left Washington today for the summit, with a three-day
stopover in Helsinki, Finland, en route.
   The president was looking ahead to the next arms-control treaty,
one he hopes will call for massive reductions in U.S. and Soviet
arsenals of intercontinental nuclear missiles. He said he hoped
such a pact could be reached before his term expires in January.
   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty, and not some
arbitrary deadline, that will determine the timetable,'' Reagan
said in remarks broadcast on the government's ``Worldnet''
satellite service.
   The treaty, which requires elimination within three years of all
U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400
miles, requires 67 votes for Senate approval. Estimates of Senate
support for the measure range from 87 to 95 votes, so its ultimate
outcome is not in question.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, as it is known,
would result in the elimination of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe, and
elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles.
   But Helms and a few other conservatives have sought to delay the
measure, raising questions about the validity of intelligence data
on the numbers of some Soviet missiles and the crafting of the
treaty language. They have offered a series of amendments since the
treaty was brought up last week, all of which have been defeated by
overwhelming margins.
   ``Both sides fouled up on this treaty,'' Helms said during
Tuesday's debate. ``My conscience will not allow me not to pursue
the obvious defects.''
   But Byrd and Dole filed motions Tuesday to limit the debate, and
a vote on that matter was scheduled for sometime Thursday. It was
considered virtually certain to win the 60 votes needed to cut off
debate, and that would set up a vote on final approval of the
treaty for sometime Friday.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a treaty supporter, said he believed
opponents were not attacking the intermediate-range missile treaty
but were instead trying to sow doubt about a future treaty cutting
long-range missile arsenals.
   ``It seems to me like nuclear idolatry,'' Bumpers said. ``The
ideologues will never, never go gently into that night.''
   Byrd said he was confident Democrats would still be able to
bring up and debate the one amendment adopted during committee
consideration of the treaty, one that would force the president to
get Senate approval for any later change in interpretation of the
treaty.
   The amendment is an attempt to assert the Senate's
constitutional right of advise and consent on the president's
treaty-making power, and stems from a dispute over Reagan
administration reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty with the Soviets.
   Byrd said today he had prepared a possible compromise on the
amendment, which was put forward by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., but
declined to discuss it.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis pocketed endorsements today from more than a dozen members
of Congress and met privately with vanquished rival Albert Gore Jr.
as he methodically made the rounds of the Capitol.
   The Massachusetts governor also renewed his criticism of
President Reagan's veto of trade legislation. He said it was ``a
tragedy'' to veto the measure over a provision requiring companies
to give 60 days notice to workers before closing a plant.
   In addition, during a meeting with Western lawmakers, Dukakis
criticized the administration's environmental policies, saying
offshore oil drilling ``should be a last resort, not a first.''
   Though Republican Vice President George Bush is considered
strong in the West, Dukakis told the lawmakers he would run an
aggressive campaign in their states. He said the issues that are
important to voters nationwide are the same ones that concern
Western voters including jobs, education, economic opportunity, a
clean and safe America and a ``strong America.''
   Dukakis' private talk with Gore resulted in no endorsement, and
aides said in advance none was expected. ``It was a good, friendly
meeting,'' Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said of the session. He
said the two men met in Dukakis' hotel room without aides.
   The Massachusetts governor also was receiving the formal
endorsement of several members of the House and Senate and the
views of several dozen others in a fast-paced series of meetings.
Dukakis spent his morning in Washington before a scheduled flight
to California and an evening debate with Jesse Jackson in advance
of the state's June 7 primary.
   Dukakis is the Democratic nominee in all but name, and his
morning schedule was designed to depict him as the leader of a
united party. He moved from meeting to meeting with lawmakers who
will share the Democratic ticket with him in the fall.
   The Dukakis campaign said those endorsing the governor included:
Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Quentin
Burdick of North Dakota, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, Harry Reid of
Nevada and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
   Among House members, Reps. Frank Annunzio of Illinois; John
Bryant of Texas; Norman Dicks of Washington; William Ford of
Michigan, Tony Hall of Ohio, Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, Tom
Lantos, Leon Panetta, Nancy Pelosi, Pete Stark, Tony Beilenson, Vic
Fazio and Esteban Torres of California; Peter Rodino of New Jersey;
James Scheuer of New York; Richard Stallings of Idaho; Ron Wyden of
Oregon.
   Dukakis' campaign made sure that the governor's meetings with
those lawmakers, as well as groups of southern and western
congressmen, were well covered by reporters.
   In contrast, the session with Gore was held in unusual privacy.
The meeting did not appear on Dukakis' printed schedule, and the
senator walked alone into the Washington hotel where Dukakis was
staying and was ushered into his room.
   The Tennessee senator has more than 350 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention in his column, and has urged his
supporters to stay loyal. But Dukakis has slowly been whittling
away at Gore's delegate strength.
   
   
   The Massachusetts governor has 1,680 delegates, out of 2,081
needed to win the nomination. Aides say they have no doubt that
Dukakis will emerge from the final day of the primary season with a
nominating majority in hand.
   These campaign officials say they expect Dukakis will earn
roughly 300 of the 456 delegates at stake June 7 in the year's
final Democratic primaries in California, New Jersey, Montana and
New Mexico.
   That would mean they need to find another 100 to 150 from the
ranks of the uncommitted or from candidate dropouts like Gore to
reach the total needed to clinch the nomination.
   Dukakis spent Tuesday night in Washington after an evening
fund-raiser in Virginia.
   The Massachusetts governor set out on his campaign swing after
spending most of Tuesday in Boston, where he issued a statement
that managed to link President Reagan's veto of the trade bill with
the administration's protracted negotiations with Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega, indicted on drug charges.
   ``Any administration that is willing to give General Noriega 120
days' notice and a plea bargain ought to be willing to give the
American worker 60 days notice before they are thrown out on the
street,'' the statement said. Reagan vetoed the trade bill, citing
objections over a provision requiring employers to give workers
advance warning on plant closings.
   In his statement, Dukakis tied his probable Republican opponent
in the fall, Vice President George Bush, to the veto, saying that
neither the president nor the vice president understands ``that for
working families who struggle to pay the mortgage, save for their
children's education and care for their elders, there is nothing
more painful than losing a job.''
   ``I think the president is making a very serious mistake,'' the
governor told reporters. ``This is a good trade bill. It's a
responsible bill. ... To veto this bill because it will give
working people and their families 60 days notice beore they're laid
off, seems to be to be unconscionable,'' he said.

   David Letterman said today in a statement
released by NBC that his manager and attorney are negotiating with
the Writers Guild of America to get his ``Late Night'' show back on
the air, possibly as early as June 8.
   The Writers Guild has been on strike against television and
motion picture producers since March 7. Negotiations broke off soon
after the strike started, but resumed this week with a federal
negotiator, and a session is scheduled for today. No details of the
negotiations have been released.
   Only ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and one independent
movie producer have received waivers from the Guild to continue
production during the strike.
   Johnny Carson, whose ``Tonight Show,'' like ``Late Night,'' has
been in reruns since the strike began, went back on the air last
week, writing his own material. Carson is not a member of the
Writers Guild, but Letterman is.
   Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers Guild of America
East, said if the union membership agreed in its meeting on
Thursday, the Letterman show could receive a waiver.
   ``We assume he is referring in his statement to the independent
contracts, which, if the members agree at the meetings on Thursday,
will be available to David Letterman as well. We do not wish to
comment further on the substance of our conversations between our
lawyers and the David Letterman people,'' she said.
   Letterman's statement, typically tongue-in-cheek, said:
   ``During the last two weeks, my manager Jack Rollins, my
attorney Ron Elberger, and U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese have been
working with the Writers Guild of America and NBC in an attempt to
resume production of `Late Night.' The signs seem most encouraging
that we could return to the air, accompanied by our entire writing
staff, as early as June 8, 1988.
   ``In the meantime, I am keeping busy with my gardening and
phoning my favorite talk-radio programs. Last month, I splurged and
treated myself to much-needed liposuction surgery on my hips and
thighs. I look and feel 10 years younger.
   ``Finally, I would like to thank our audience, the best-looking
television audience in America, for their loyalty and patience.''

   U.S.-backed rebels have accepted
Managua as the site for a new round of peace talks with the
government, a rebel spokesman said today.
   Roberto Ferrey, secretary of the Nicaraguan Resistance
directorate, said by telephone from Costa Rica that the rebel
delegation, headed by Alfredo Cesar, would go to Managua later
today.
   The government of President Daniel Ortega had insisted that the
talks, scheduled to begin today, be held here.
   The rebels, known as Contras, had refused to return to Managua,
complaining of strict government limits on their activities during
two previous sessions. They wanted instead to meet with leftist
Sandinista officials in Sapoa, a post on the Costa Rican border
where the two sides signed a preliminary peace plan on March 23.
   The aim of the talks is to work out details of a permanent
cease-fire in the war that Ortega says has killed 26,500 people and
caused $3 billion in damage to the economy.
   Ferrey said the Contras would go to Managua ``with the
understanding that there will be complete and unrestricted freedom
of expression and the free right to meet with organizations and
leaders.''
   The government had reiterated Tuesday that it would allow the
rebels to meet with the most important opposition group in the
country, the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, visit the Roman
Catholic bishops conference and the opposition daily La Prensa, as
well as relatives.
   Presidential press secretary Manuel Espinoza said today that the
government ``has everything ready'' to receive them.
   American and Honduran officials, meanwhile, said Nicaragua
appears to be building up arms stockpiles to attack the rebels if
the peace talks fail, according to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that American
and Honduran officials cited aerial reconnaissance photographs of
Nicaraguan territory and other evidence they say suggest a
Sandinista military buildup.
   U.S. officials said the photos showed that airfields at Wapsam
near the Honduran border and at La Tranquera in southern Nicaragua
have been upgraded.
   They say pictures also show new military storage depots are
being built near Sebaco, 50 miles north of Managua, and that
military supplies are being stockpiled at El Tempisque, just
outside Managua.
   In Washington, a congressional aide said the rebels planned to
offer to lay down their arms on Sept. 1 as part of a comprehensive
peace accord to be presented to the Sandinistas.
   Contra leader Alfredo Cesar said the proposal will include ``all
the necessary things for a permanent end to the war in Nicaragua.''
   Ortega had argued that holding the talks in Sapoa ``would be to
put the conversations at the brink of breaking off'' and would mark
``a setback in political terms.''
   ``It would be to accept that all that has been achieved since
the first contacts (late last year) can be lost,'' he added.
   In the initial Sapoa plan, the negotiators agreed on a 60-day
cease-fire to give time to arrange a more lasting peace.
   The temporary truce was scheduled to run out on May 30, but
Ortega on Monday announced he was unilaterally extending it for an
additional 30 days.
   In Washington, members of the rebels' political directorate said
they would not break the truce after it expires May 30, even if no
new truce agreement is in effect. But they said they were not
officially accepting Ortega's extension.
   The Contra leaders also said they would accept a proposal for
delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside Nicaragua by an
agency with ties to the Organization of American States.

   India will have good monsoon rains this
year to help make up for last year's widespread drought, a
government official predicted on Wednesday.
   Vasant Gowariker, secretary of the Department of Science and
Technology, said he expected the first rain to hit the western
state of Kerala by the weekend, the United News of India reported.
   He said that a study by his department and the Indian
Meteorology Department of weather patterns indicated that most
factors this year ``favor a good monsoon'' rain, UNI said.
   The study looked at temperatures around the country in May, wind
patterns and pre-monsoon rainfall, which has been normal is most
parts of the country.
   More than two-thirds of India's 800 million people work in
agriculture, which is heavily dependent on rain.
   Last year the rains failed in 16 of the nation's 25 states,
sharply reducing rice, wheat and fodder production. India is
importing wheat from the United States and corn from Argentina to
make up for the losses.
   The rains fall from June through September and account for more
than two-thirds of India's annual rainfall.

<HEAD>Pope Calls for More Priests in Latin America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church in Latin America
urgently needs more priests to counter inroads made by religious
groups from North America, Pope John Paul II said Wednesday.
   The pontiff, speaking in Italian, told an audience in St.
Peter's Square that ``the shortage of priests indirectly
facilitates the penetration by various sects generally of North
American origin.''
   He did not mention specific groups. However, fundamentalist
evangelical denominations have been highly active in Latin America
in recent years.
   The pope made the statement while commenting on his pilgrimage
to four South American countries earlier this month. He argued
Wednesday that recruiting priests was the principal need of the
Latin American church.

<HEAD>Genetic Sampling Can Replace Whale-Hunting for Research,
Scientists Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whales can be studied without being killed if
researchers take skin samples for genetic analysis, two scientists
say.
   ``Management policies and conservation measures may now be
determined without the need to kill whales,'' A. Rus Hoelzel and
William Amos of Cambridge University write in a letter in
Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Whale-hunting for scientific purposes has become a political
issue. President Reagan imposed fishing sanctions against Japan in
April for approving the killing of 300 minke whales in the
Antarctic for research purposes.
   The International Whaling Commission had passed a resolution
opposing the hunt. Japanese officials say the commission has no
power to ban such whaling.
   Researchers plan to study the health, growth rates and diet of
the whales, Japanese officials said.
   In their letter, Hoelzel and Amos said researchers have gained
valuable information about whales from commercial and scientific
whaling, as well as from stranded animals.
   But given what has already been discovered, ``our new priority
should be to characterize accurately the size of populations and
their genetic status,'' they wrote. ``The technology needed to
determine these fundamental population parameters without killing
animals is at hand.''
   Skin samples can be retrieved by firing a specialized arrow,
equipped to recover a skin sample and tethered to a fly casting
reel, into the animal's skin, they said.
   Genetic analysis can then determine each animal's distinctive
``DNA fingerprint,'' providing an accurate method for population
counts, they said.
   Other genetic studies can trace reproductive behavior and the
status of genes present in whale populations, they said.

<TEXT>
   Genes play a major role in whether a honey bee
serves its hive as a groomer, guard or even an undertaker, two
studies suggest.
   Certain genes may make particular bees more responsive to
environmental cues that trigger those behaviors, the authors wrote.
   The findings have ``substantial implications for our
understanding of the evolution of division of labor in colonies of
social insects,'' Michael Breed of the University of Colorado at
Boulder said in an editorial accompanying the papers, which appear
in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Bee colonies are collections of subfamilies, each created by the
queen bee and a different drone.
   Researchers used artificial insemination to establish
subfamilies that could later be differentiated. Then they looked
for relationships between a bee's subfamily, and therefore its
genetic inheritance, and its job in the hive.
   Gene Robinson and Robert Page Jr. of Ohio State University
studied worker bees that specialized in standing guard at the hive
entrance or in removing corpses. Only a minority of bees do those
jobs, they wrote.
   They found significant genetic differences between the groups,
and between each specialist group and other worker bees.
   The other study found evidence for genetic influence on the
tendency of worker bees to groom nestmates, wrote Peter Frumhoff
and Jayne Baker, who did the work at the University of California
at Davis.
   In the editorial, Breed said scientists should now see if queen
bees choose a range of mates that would encourage variety in jobs.
Queen bees mate up to 17 times, he said.

<TEXT>
   Iowa Democrats are nervously watching a
crop of candidates loyal to political extremist Lyndon LaRouche,
and worrying about a predicted dismal turnout in for June 7 primary
featuring no statewide contests.
   Some top Democrats even have endorsed Republicans in a couple of
legislative districts.
   ``I'm confident that where there is a race we're going to win,''
said Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder.
   In all, 16 LaRouche backers are running in Iowa Democratic
primaries, five seeking congressional nominations and the rest
running in legislative districts.
   Roeder said Democrats will work to make sure voters know which
candidates back LaRouche and will deny them access to
party-sponsored events. ``We'll be helping out the regular
Democratic candidates,'' Roeder said.
   In 1986, three LaRouche backers ran for office, when Juan Cortez
of Cedar Rapids got nearly 18 percent of the vote in a U.S. Senate
primary.
   The increase has Democrats scratching their heads, because the
state's farm-based economy is improving.
   ``The `send them a message' slogan that everybody was using in
the Midwest was very relevant, we had big problems,'' Roeder said.
``The general resentment toward government just isn't there this
time.''
   Few of the LaRouche candidates are actively campaigning, though
two legislative candidates will get the official party nomination
because they are the only Democrats on the ballot.
   House Speaker Don Avenson, who runs Democratic legislative
elections, has endorsed Republican incumbents in those districts.
   ``I far prefer a mainstream Republican to a LaRouche backer,''
Avenson said.
   ``We're going to urge voters not to vote for them,'' Roeder
said. ``That means they either don't vote in that particular
election, or they vote for the Republican.
   ``While the number may have gone up this time, the level of
activity has gone down,'' Roeder said.
   Part of the reason Democrats are nervous is the experience in
neighboring Illinois, where two LaRouche backers won statewide
primaries in the last election, tossing that state's party into
turmoil and destroying efforts to unseat Republican Gov. James
Thompson.
   ``I think everybody learned a good lesson from Illinois,''
Roeder said.
   Aggravating the worries is a projected low turnout, which state
officials say could be less than 15 per percent of the 1.6 million
registered voters.
   Iowa political activists were wearied by months of intense
presidential campaigning leading up to precinct caucuses Feb. 8,
and there are few races of interest to draw voters.
   It's the first election since 1976 in which neither a Senate
seat nor the governor's office is at stake, and all six incumbent
congressmen are seeking re-election.
   Only freshman Democrat David Nagle in northeast Iowa's 3rd
District has primary opposition, and that comes from LaRouche
backer James Cox, of Grinnell.
   In that district, Republicans Don Redfern and Marvin Simpson
square off in a GOP primary. Redfern wanted to run when the seat
was open in 1986, but forgot to sign his nominating petition and
missed the filing deadline by 15 minutes.
   Freshman Republican Rep. Fred Grandy, who for years played
Gopher on television's ``Love Boat,'' has no primary opposition in
his bid for a second term from western Iowa's 6th District. There
are, however, four Democrats running in a primary.
   With little activity at the top of the ticket, election
officials say they're counting on local elections to spark pockets
of voter interest. There are 30 Democratic legislative primaries
and 17 for Republicans. In addition, sheriffs in all 99 of the
state's counties face election this year, and that office usually
gets heavy local attention.
   As of this month, Iowa had 495,182 registered Republicans,
562,039 registered Democrats and 504,082 registered voters who
expressed no party preference.

<HEAD>6 Sailors Accused In Recruit's Drwning Get Navy Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Naval investigator at a hearing for six
sailors charged in the March 2 drowning of a recruit denied a
defense request today to close the proceedings to the public.
   The hearings, which began today, are the military equivalent of
a grand jury inquiry.
   Lawyers for two of the sailors argued that extensive press
coverage would prejudice any future panel that may consider the
case if court-martials are ordered in the death of airman recruit
Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis.
   Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio Jr., the investigating officer, said he
may close portions of the hearings to consider whether certain
evidence can be admitted or might prejudice any future
court-martial.
   ``I think the law is clear: If there is any closure it is to be
done with a scalpel, not an ax,'' D'Alesio said.
   Mirecki died during rescue training exercises at a Pensacola
Naval Air Station pool. Investigators said he was dragged into the
pool against his will, and his head held under water.
   On May 10, five instructors were charged with involuntary
manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery, and their commanding
officer was charged with dereliction of duty.
   D'Alesio, of the Naval Legal Service Office in Philadelphia,
will recommend whether the charges should be handled at a
presidential preference of the delegates selected or allocated thus
far to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, July 18-21,
1988.

<HEAD>Dems Ask Reagan to Halt Aid to Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats called today on the Reagan
administration to halt current deliveries of aid to Nicaragua's
Contra rebels, including plans for cash payments to the troops, and
set up a new delivery system through an organization linked to the
Organization of American States.
   Meeting in a closed-door caucus, party members approved a
resolution stating that the current delivery system _ which
includes a carrier with past ties to the CIA _ violates a
two-month-old cease-fire agreement and the legislation that
provided $17.7 million in humanitarian aid.
   The resolution called on the administration to ``make immediate
arrangements for delivery of aid through the Pan-American
Development Foundation,'' an OAS arm that has been deemed
acceptable to both the rebels and the Sandinista government in
public statements.
   The State Department's Agency for International Development,
which is administering the aid program, has so far delivered 600
metric tons of food, clothing and other supplies to rebel forces
inside Honduras through other private contractors, said AID
spokesman Roger Noriega.
   The loads delivered so far have been inspected by
representatives of the Catholic church in Honduras to make sure
they contain no lethal supplies, Noriega said. Most of the
deliveries have been made by truck, although there have been about
a dozen airdrops, he said.
   AID also plans to begin this week purchasing cordobas, the
Nicaraguan currency, for distribution to rebel troops in the field
as early as next week, Noriega added. Troops will receive about $1
a day each, he said.
   Noriega said AID could not begin to make delivery arrangements
with the foundation, as the Democrats requested, because it had no
formal notification that the organization is acceptable to both
sides.
   ``There has to be a formal agreement in place,'' he said. ``We
have said all along that the neutral delivery mechanism has to be
part of an agreement between the resistance and the Sandinista
government.''
   He added: ``It is wholly unrealistic to expect AID to talk with
the PADF in specific terms until there is a signed agreement or
some kind of reliable public statement.''

<TEXT>
   British Airways canceled two flights to the
continent and combined others Wednesday because of a walkout by
3,500 maintenance workers at Heathrow Airport, company officials
said.
   The workers, who maintain and repair the firm's Heathrow-based
airplanes, walked off the job Monday to protest firing of a union
official.
   Flight disruptions were expected to worsen this weekend, a

    ... Superpower wrangling over President Reagan's
prized space-based missile defense is being viewed as the major
stumbling block in negotiations to cut U.S. and Soviet long-range
nuclear arsenals by up to 50 percent.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had hoped to sign
the treaty at their Moscow summit, beginning Sunday.
   The strategic arms reduction treaty would have slashed U.S. and
Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent _ by far the
most radical achievement in the roller coaster history of arms
control.
   There are still unresolved problems about verification. How, for
example, could U.S. monitors be sure the Soviets were not illegally
hiding missiles, especially those that are hard to track? Mobile
missiles are in this elusive category. So are cruise missiles
carried by planes and warships.
   Still, the Strategic Defense Initiative _ popularly called Star
Wars _ and Soviet attempts to constrain it, turned out to be the
main treaty spoiler.
   The program, launched by Reagan five years ago, is a
multi-billion-dollar search for ways to use lasers, kinetic energy
or other futuristic technology to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles
as they hurtle through space toward their targets.
   Reagan and his supporters see the space defense program as a
natural complement to nuclear weapons reductions. They want to
reduce offensive arms and also improve defenses so the weapons
remaining in the Soviet strategic arsenal have less of a chance of
getting through.
   Besides, they are convinced that the Soviets, while protesting
Star Wars, are quietly engaged in their own space defense program.
   At the last superpower summit, in Washington in December, the
Soviets proposed that the two sides agree to abide by the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ``as signed and ratified.''
   The accord limited anti-missile defenses on the theory that a
potential aggressor would hesitate to launch an attack if his weak
defense exposed his own country to devastating retaliation.
   The United States countered, proposing language to allow
space-based testing of Star Wars technology ``as required.''
   At the windup, the two sides agreed on an ambiguous statement
that included ``as signed'' from the Soviet proposal and ``as
required'' from the U.S. side. It did not settle the dispute over
the future of Star wars.
   During negotiations this year in Geneva, the Soviets proposed
attaching to the START a protocol to limit space defense tests and
demanded the right to stop cutting back their missiles if they
concluded the U.S. program violated the 1972 ABM treaty. However,
the U.S. side refused.
   Instead, the United States proposed that the Soviets explicitly
accept a broad interpretation of the 1972 treaty _ one that would
give the current administration and succeeding ones a lot of
running room to experiment in space. The net result was deadlock.
   Referring to the Star Wars dispute and the verification
problems, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier this
month, ``It's now clear there is no way these questions can be
shaped up in treaty form in time for the summit.''
   So when Reagan meets Gorbachev in Moscow they will have no
treaty to sign.
   All that will be ready for them to approve is a single provision
designed to ease tensions. It is a pledge for each side to notify
the other before any missile test launchings.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis breezed through the Capitol on Wednesday, picking up
endorsements and advice from members of Congress and declaring he
will not ``concede one single state to the Republicans'' in the
fall campaign.
   Dukakis also met privately with defeated rival Albert Gore Jr.
He got no endorsement there but said he and the Tennessee senator
had a ``very cordial meeting.''
   The Massachusetts governor took a fresh shot at President
Reagan's veto of trade legislation. He said it was ``a tragedy'' to
reject the big trade bill over a provision requiring companies to
give their workers 60 days advance notice before shutting down a
plant.
   In a meeting with Western lawmakers, Dukakis also criticized the
administration's environmental policies, saying offshore oil
drilling ``should be a last resort, not a first.''
   He made his fast-paced tour of the Capitol before flying off on
a Western campaign swing, including a Wednesday night debate in San
Francisco with Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis expects to wrap up a nominating majority of Democratic
National Convention delegates on June 7, the final day of the
primary season when elections are set in California, New Jersey,
Montana and New Mexico.
   Several Southern lawmakers observed pointedly that Dukakis had
fended off pressure during the primary campaign from traditional
Democratic interest groups, and they said he would be a more
popular general election candidate that Walter F. Mondale was in
1984.
   Sen. Terry Sanford of North Carolina said that four years ago
Mondale ``overpromised'' in the early primaries whereas Dukakis did
not. That was a reference to the perception that Mondale catered to
a series of special interest groups during his campaign.
   Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana said Dukakis has been ``able to
resist many demands'' that look good but turn out to pose problems
later on.
   Dukakis said repeatedly he will contest Bush in every state.
``We are not going to concede one single state to the Republicans
in the fall,'' he said.
   The Massachusetts governor held separate sessions with Southern
and Western lawmakers, where the talk centered on regional issues.
   In contrast to the meetings in the Capitol which were
orchestrated for maximum news coverage, the session with Gore took
place as quietly as could be managed.
   It was not on Dukakis' printed schedule, and the two men met
privately in Dukakis' hotel room.
   The Massachusetts governor said they had had a ``very good
conversation.''
   Asked whether Gore had agreed to release more than 350 delegates
pledged to him, Dukakis repeated, ``It was a very cordial
meeting.'' Gore wrote his delegates last week urging them to stay
loyal at least for the time being.
   Even so, Dukakis has been steadily whittling away at Gore's
delegates as he has moved towards winning a nominating majority.
   The lawmakers who endorsed Dukakis during the day included:
   Sens. Sanford, Breaux, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Quentin Burdick
of North Dakota, Wendell Ford of Kentucky, Harry Reid of Nevada and
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
   Among House members, Reps. Frank Annunzio of Illinois; John
Bryant of Texas; Norman Dicks of Washington; William Ford of
Michigan, Tony Hall of Ohio, Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, Tom
Lantos, Leon Panetta, Nancy Pelosi, Pete Stark, Tony Beilenson, Vic
Fazio and Esteban Torres of California; Peter Rodino of New Jersey;
James Scheuer of New York; Richard Stallings of Idaho and Ron Wyden
of Oregon.

   A man who used $44,000 mistakenly
credited to his bank account to woo his future wife has pleaded
guilty to larceny.
   Ali-Kausar Barlas, a native of Pakistan, entered the plea
Tuesday in Superior Court. Under a plea bargain, prosecutors
recommended he be placed on probation and be ordered to repay the
money. Sentencing was set for July 7.
   Barlas was an East Hartford car salesman two years ago when he
deposited a $374 check into his checking account. Connecticut
National Bank mistakenly credited him for a deposit of $44,374,
officials said.
   Barlas took the money and went back to Pakistan, where he paid
his girlfriend's parents $10,000 and spent another $10,000
entertaining the woman's family, authorities said.
   He returned with his girlfriend and was arrested in July. He is
scheduled to marry the woman next week.

   School children say they prefer watching
television to any other leisure activity, while reading is the
least popular pastime, according to a survey released Wednesday.
   Grade schoolers also say they trust what they hear on television
more than what they read in newspapers, the survey released by
Weekly Reader says.
   In the lower grades they love reading books, but that ardor
cools by grades 4 to 6, the survey reported.
   Weekly Reader said its survey of reading and TV habits was
prompted in part because low test scores and high dropout and
illiteracy rates indicate children are reading less than they once
did.
   Survey results were compiled from teacher summaries representing
about 117,000 of more than 340,000 children who answered
questionnaires in class. Weekly Reader said that statistically the
survey was not a random sample whose results could be projected,
but it said the sample was large enough to be taken as
representative.
   Some findings:
   _Watching television was something 80 percent or more of all
children in grades two through six said they liked a lot. Only 3
percent or less said they didn't like TV.
   _Among second-graders, 65 percent said they liked reading a lot
and 8 percent said not at all. By sixth grade, only 39 percent had
a strong yen to read, 10 percent were anti-reading and the rest
were lukewarm.
   _Newspaper reading was popular with 28 percent of
second-graders, but with only 11 percent of fifth- and
sixth-graders. Those who said they did not like reading newspapers
at all ranged from 35 percent of sixth-graders to 43 percent of
fourth-graders.
   _Asked what they typically do at home, 55 percent said watch TV,
14 percent play, 14 percent talk on the telephone, 11 percent
listen to the radio and 6 percent read.
   _Asked where they get their news, 69 percent said television, 23
percent radio, 5 percent magazines and 3 percent newspapers.
   _Fifty-seven percent said they believed the TV news a lot, but
only 47 percent said they had strong faith in newspapers, 45
percent in radio and 15 percent in magazines.

<HEAD>Record Export Sales Offset Import Climb in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed dramatically
during the first three months of the year as an all-time high in
American export sales offset a relentless climb in imports, the
Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
   The trade deficit from January through March totaled $35.9
billion, a 12.7 percent drop from a deficit of $41.2 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   It was only the second quarterly improvement in the deficit in
the past two years and it represented the biggest decline since the
deficit fell by 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1982.
   Analysts said the sharp narrowing showed that the United States
has finally turned the corner on trade and should see in 1988 the
first yearly decline in the trade deficit since 1980.
   ``We believe that 1988 will finally be the year of the
turnaround, and these figures support that prediction,'' said
Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., an economic
consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
   She predicted the trade deficit would fall this year by about 10
percent from last year's record $160.3 billion deficit, when
measured on a balance-of-payments basis.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown
up in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. The
earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $36
billion in the first quarter, compared with $43.1 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   Wednesday's figures are smaller because they subtract factors
such as shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers.
The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal
variations; the monthly figures are not.
   ``We are making slow but steady improvement, but we shouldn't
get too confident,'' said Jay Goldinger, chief economist with
Capital Insight, a Los Angeles investment firm. ``We won't see
progress in reducing the deficit continue at this rate.''
   The improvement in the first quarter came from a 9.8 percent
surge in export sales, which rose to a record high of $74.7
billion, as American companies continued to enjoy an export boom
fueled by the weaker dollar.
   Since the spring of 1985, the dollar has fallen in value by 50
percent against the currencies of Japan and many European
countries, making U.S. products more competitive overseas.
   Unfortunately, the weaker dollar has driven up the cost of
imports as well. In the first quarter they rose to a record high of
$110.6 billion, 1.3 percent above the fourth-quarter level.
   Analysts termed the continued rise in imports disappointing, but
Ms. Latta noted that much of the growth in imports apparently came
not from consumer demand but from a pickup in business spending as
U.S. factories boosted investment to expand production facilities
in order to meet the increased export demand.
   She said this business investment should slow in coming
quarters, and this would help lower imports.
   The Reagan administration is counting on strong export sales to
provide close to half of total economic growth in the United States
this year as well as blunt the drive by Congress to enact trade
legislation that the White House considers protectionist.
   President Reagan cited the improving trade figures on Tuesday
when he vetoed the omnibus trade bill.
   The figures are in current dollars before adjusting for price
changes caused by the decline in the value of the dollar since
1985. When inflation is factored out, the trade deficit in volume
terms fell 12.8 percent in the first quarter to $36.7 billion when
expressed in 1982 dollars.
   In current dollars, the trade deficit with Japan fell by $1.9
billion to $12.9 billion in the first quarter. The trade deficit
with Western Europe dropped by an even sharper $3.8 billion to $4.5
billion. The deficit with the newly industrialized countries of
Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, fell by $1.1 billion
to $6.9 billion.

<HEAD>Allies Think `Star Wars' Program May Fade Out</HEAD>

   Only a year ago, one of the hottest
topics of public debate in Western Europe was President Reagan's
plan for a missile defense system in space.
   Today it's rarely mentioned, and when it is talked about, there
is little of the urgency or anguish that punctuated the earlier
discussion.
   ``There's a more relaxed attitude now,'' said Peter Corterier, a
West German who is secretary-general of the North Atlantic
Assembly, an advisory body of legislators from 16 NATO countries.
   The main reason: a growing number of American allies in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization suspect the U.S. public's
enthusiasm for Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as ``Star Wars,'' has passed its high-water mark.
   ``It's becoming less likely that it ever will come about,'' says
Ton Frinking, a centrist Christian Democrat and member of the Dutch
Parliament.
   The Europeans recognize that the issue of space-based defenses
is still an important obstacle to a U.S.-Soviet agreement on
reductions in long-range nuclear weapons.
   But as Reagan headed for Moscow for his fourth meeting with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Europeans appeared less concerned that
SDI would be the main problem.
   The Soviets strongly oppose the plan, saying it would lead to an
arms race in space. They have insisted that Reagan renounce the
program, although the vehemence of the Soviet argument has subsided
recently.
   ``It seems to be negotiable now,'' said Frinking, adding that a
key reason for this was mounting concern in Congress about the cost
of the program.
   ``The Americans aren't going to pay for it,'' Frinking said in a
recent interview, noting that the next U.S. administration will
inherit huge budget and trade deficits.
   Reagan insists he will not drop the idea of building the
defensive shield, which he said could make nuclear weapons
``impotent and obsolete.'' But the program faces severe financial
constraints.
   For the current budget year, the Defense Department has been
allotted $3.6 billion for SDI research. That's $1.7 billion less
than it wanted.
   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the House Armed Services
Committee has recommended holding the research allotment to $4.1
billion. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the amount is too
small and will lead to ``major restructuring and delays in the
program.''
   Frinking and other Europeans say their doubts about the future
of the program are strengthened by recent reports suggesting SDI
may wither in the 1990s.
   The Defense Science Board, an independent Pentagon advisory
panel, said in a report this month that SDI initially should be
scaled back to a limited, ground-based defense against missiles.
   When he first proposed the idea in March 1983, Reagan said he
wanted a space-based shield that could protect not only North
America but also Western Europe from ballistic missile attack.
   Reagan's vision, which he linked to the possibility of
eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide, stirred heated debate in
Europe. Some said it brought into doubt the basic NATO strategy of
deterring attack by maintaining large arsenals of offensive nuclear
weapons.
   Many West European governments were ambivalent, if not hostile,
to Reagan's proposal. Among their concerns was that it might
provide only a limited defense for Europe.
   Three years ago, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
said SDI raised crucial questions for NATO strategy. He suggested
that a space-based shield could be ``outflanked by relatively
simpler and demonstrably cheaper countermeasures.''
   Among the NATO allies, only Britain, West Germany and Italy have
signed formal agreements to participate in research for the
program. There are indications that even these three are not
entirely happy with it.
   In September, the North Atlantic Assembly adopted a report
accusing Washington of breaking a promise to offer its allies more
than a token role in SDI research. It said non-American companies
had been awarded less than $100 million in contracts through the
end of 1986, compared with $7.3 billion for U.S. firms.
   Despite this irritation, the U.S. allies rarely raise the Star
Wars issue any more.
   In a special report this month on the future of the Western
alliance, a select committee of the North Atlantic Assembly
expounded on nearly every aspect of defense and security, including
NATO's technological challenges. There was not a single word about
SDI.

   A new treaty making deep cuts in each
superpower's arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons could be
dangerous because the Soviets could either cheat or legally evade
limits in the pact, a House Armed Services study contended
Wednesday.
   The report was issued an hour after President Reagan left for
Moscow and his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. One of the topics on the agenda is the proposed
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START).
   ``No START agreement will come out of the summit next week and
that's good,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
committee. ``There is a great deal to be done before arms control
policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized.''
   The proposed START agreement would affect the long-range arsenal
of each nation. It is being negotiated now and is designed as a
successor to the separate U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating
medium-range missiles, a pact now before the Senate for
ratification.
   The outlines of the proposed START agreement generally call for
each side to cut its long-range arsenal by about 50 percent, to
6,000 weapons, Aspin said.
   But weapons-counting provisions which Aspin said have already
been agreed to on both sides would allow the Soviets to legally add
as many as 3,000 warheads _ and the Soviets could add up to 4,300
more if they cheat, the Wisconsin Democrat noted.
   ``All of this does not mean we should abandon arms control
generally or START in particular,'' Aspin said. ``What it does say
is that we should look to the structure of our own forces to
guarantee deterrence.''
   The warnings were issued by the defense policy panel, an Armed
Services subcommittee which Aspin has used to examine arms control
issues.
   The proposed limit of 6,000 weapons ``is an illusion,'' the
study said. That is because of the proposed counting rules which
treat each bomber as a single weapon _ regardless of how many
nuclear weapons, such as bombs or missiles, are carried on each
plane.
   ``The United States also would be allowed similar additional
weapons,'' it said. ``In fact, because the United States has more
bombers, it would probably end up with more legal weapons.''
   ``Thus, the actual ceiling on weapons under START is more like
9,000-10,000 on each side, rather than 6,000,'' the panel said.
   The Soviets would also be able to cheat, particularly since the
proposed START pact would not ban flight tests of permitted
weapons. Weapons could be hidden without fears about their
capability because some could be flight-tested, it noted.
   The issue is similar to one which was raised as part of the
medium-range missile pact, Aspin said. Among the weapons banned by
that pact is the Soviet SS-20 and the Soviets have declared a
stockpile of 250 of the weapons which must be destroyed.
   Some U.S. intelligence agencies believe that even more SS-20s
may be hidden, but their military value will degrade, according to
supporters of the treaty, because the pact bans any flight tests.
   ``START will not ban flight tests, so the military capability of
any concealed forces will not decline over time,'' giving the
Soviets incentive to cheat, the study said.
   It said the Soviets could also break out any START treaty
quicker than the United States.
   The reason is that ``given the history of U.S. strategic arms
development, it seems unlikely that the president would propose
such a course (a break-out) or the Congress approve it. A U.S.
planner, however, could not rely upon internal checks and balances
in the Soviet Union.''
   Thus, ``the United States must plan for a Soviet force not of
6,000 weapons, but of many, many more,'' the study said.
   Stricter verification is not the answer because no verification
is likely to be strict enough, it said. Besides, procedures such as
anytime, anywhere inspections might hurt the United States because
the Soviet inspections would be given the same right to look at
U.S. facilities.

   At West Bloomfield High School's senior

   The school's student leadership group organized Tuesday's prom
for people who missed their own prom or wanted to attend another.
   The age difference made things uneasy for at least one student.
   ``My date wants to know when bingo starts,'' one young lady said.
   Al Krusac missed taking his girlfriend, Clara, to their 1936

this woman.''

   A judge on Wednesday sentenced an
18-year-old man to spend the rest of his life in prison for beating
a classmate to death in a crime prosecutors described as a satanic
sacrifice.
   Camden County Circuit Judge James Franklin sentenced James Hardy
of Joplin to life in prison without possibility of parole, the
circuit clerk said.
   Hardy had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for
prosecutors' promise not to seek the death penalty.
   Prosecutors accused Hardy and two other teen-agers of beating
19-year-old Stephen Newberry with baseball bats and dumping his
body in a cistern. Prosecutors say the Dec. 6 beating was fueled by
the teen-agers' involvement with drugs, satanism and violent rock
music.
   One defendant was convicted of first-degree murder earlier this
month. During that trial, a psychiatrist testified that Hardy was
the leader of the teen-agers' self-styled satanic cult, and planned
Newberry's death as a sacrifice.
   The third teen-ager was to stand trial next month.

<HEAD>Two Student Given Jail Time For Drinking Party At Princeton</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Princeton University students were
sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500 each today for their
part in two parties Feb. 6 that resulted in 46 students seeking
medical attention for drinking too much.
   This is not ``an undergraduate frolic that got out of hand, it
is a violation of the law,'' said Municipal Court Judge Russell
Annich. ``I'm not aware of a similar event that has produced as
many casualties,'' he said.
   Thirty-nine students went to the university infirmary and seven
to the hospital after initiation parties held by the Charter Club
and the Cloister Inn _ two of 13 on-campus eating clubs, which
resemble fraternities.
   Many of the students were underage. The legal drinking age in
New Jersey is 21.
   Kenneth Simpler, 20, of Rehoboth, Del., a junior who is
president of the Charter Club, and Lisa Napolitano, 21, of Geneva,
N.Y., a junior who is the club's former social chairperson, were
convicted May 18 of serving alcohol to minors.
   During a one-day trial, witnesses testified that students
seeking to join the Charter Club were blindfolded and led from room
to room where club members poured alcoholic drinks down their
throats.
   The judge delayed the start of the sentence so that the students
could appeal.

<HEAD>Safety Commission to Ban Most Lawn Darts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted
Wednesday to ban most lawn darts, citing the danger of death or
serious injury from the pointed metal toys.
   The ban could take effect by the end of the year, although
several legal steps remain to be completed.
   Three children, aged 4, 7 and 13, have been killed in accidents
involving the darts in recent years, according to commission
records. In addition, an estimated 670 lawn-dart injuries are
treated annually at hospital emergency rooms.
   Lawn darts, which have long metal tips, have become popular as a
yard game. They are tossed through the air, with the points
sticking into the ground in or near a target.
   The 2-1 vote called for a ban on lawn darts with the long,
dangerous metal tips, Some darts on the market, with blunt plastic
tips, would not be banned.
   The matter now goes back to the commission staff to develop a
formal rulemaking to enforce the ban and to solicit comment from
the public. After that, likely in late summer or fall, the matter
returns to the commissioners, who could then vote on a final ban
and set an effective date.
   Currently federal rules ban lawn dart sales in toy stores and
toy sections of other retail outlets, but allows them to be sold in
sporting goods stores.
   In March, the giant retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co., announced
that it was discontinuing lawn dart sales after the commission
questioned the way they were displayed in Sears stores.
   The agency is surveying other stores to see how the product is
displayed and sold.
   Voting for the ban on Wednesday were Commission Chairman
Terrence M. Scanlon and Commissioner Anne Graham. Commissioner
Carol Dawson was opposed.

   U.S. and Panamanian negotiators were close to
agreement today on a deal leading to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
resignation as his nation's defense chief and departure in August,
a Reagan administration official said.
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, said it was his
understanding that an agreement was ``consummated this morning''
but added that the package could not be considered completed until
Noriega confirms it with a public announcement, which could come
later in the day.
   According to the official, both governments were preparing
formal announcements. The key provisions of the deal reportedly
include Noriega's resignation as commander-in-chief of Panama's
Defense Forces and subsequent departure from Panama, and the
dismissal of U.S. drug smuggling indictments against him.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, en route to Helsinki,
Finland, with President Reagan, told reporters at midday:
   ``It's still a day-to-day proposition. We could hear something
at any time.''
   The Cable News Network said that Panamaniam Ambassador Juan B.
Sosa reported that a deal had been worked out.
   U.S. officials said that U.S. envoy Michael G. Kozak had worked
with Panamanian officials until the early morning hours in Panama,
hoping to complete an agreement before President Reagan left at
mid-morning for Helsinki, Finland, and, eventually, Moscow for the
summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev that begins Sunday.
   The administration apparently was intent on reaching an
agreement before Reagan's departure because it did not want the
Panama issue to overshadow his visits to Finland and the Soviet
Union.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz indicated on Tuesday the
administration was prepared to suspend the talks for the duration
of Reagan's absence from Washington if no agreement was reached.
   Today, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Shultz,
who was to accompany Reagan on the trip to Finland, delayed his
departure until later in the day to monitor the situation in Panama.
   Redman said the talks were continuing but he gave no details.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said today, ``I'm
for no deal.''
   He said, ``It sounds to me like a deal that will get the
president out of town, give prestige to Noriega, and dump the
problem in the next president's lap.''
   Sosa, who has been allied with administration efforts to ease
Noriega from power, said Tuesday that the plan being worked on by
the negotiators is certain to be rejected by the democratic
opposition in Panama.
   The anti-Noriega forces ``will reject the deal,'' Sosa told a
news conference. ``There will be no peace in Panama. The turmoil
will continue.''
   He said that the deal would enable the ``criminal empire''
Noriega has created within the Panamanian Defense Forces to remain
in place and that it would not ensure that the scheduled
presidential elections in 1989 will be free.
   Shultz disputed Sosa's contention that Kozak was attempting to
negotiate Panama's political future in violation of diplomatic
norms.
   ``What gets put together there is up to the people of Panama,''
Shultz said.
   Sosa, who has continued to function as Panama's ambassador in
Washington despite Noriega's efforts to fire him, confirmed many of
the previously reported details about the arrangement that Kozak is
negotiating.
   He said that Noriega would resign as commander of the Defense
Forces in August and leave Pamana afterward, returning once an
elected civilian government is installed in May 1989. In the
interim, he would be allowed to return to Panama for holidays. The
U.S. indictments against him would be withdrawn and the economic
sanctions the administration has imposed against Panama would be
lifted once Noriega leaves.
   President Manuel Solis Palma, who replaced ousted president Eric
Arturo Delvalle in February, would continue to govern the country
but the United States would still consider Delvalle as the
legitimate authority, Sosa said.
   The State Department position is that the indictments are
unenforceable and that their dismissal would be a small price to
pay for Noriega's departure.
   But Sosa said that the proposed deal would change little in
Panama _ amounting to ``Norieguismo without Noriega.''
   Sosa took his criticism of the administration's position on
Monday to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, one of the
chief architects of U.S. policy.
   The administration view, Sosa said, is that Noriega would lose
some power when he steps down as defense chief and lose even more
when he goes into exile. As the administration sees it, assurances
of a free press would be a further guarantee that democracy will be
restored, Sosa said.
   But Sosa disagreed. ``We shouldn't sacrifice principle for
expediency,'' he said. ``No deal is better than a bad deal.''

<HEAD>Israel Launchs Advertising Campaign to Counter Arab Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel launched a $5 million advertising
campaign Wednesday to counter the crippling effects on its tourist
industry of the nearly 6-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied
territories.
   Officials had hoped to reap a tourist bonanza on Israel's 40th
anniversary, but now they're anticipating a drop of about $300
million. That would make tourism, the nation's biggest source of
foreign capital, the industry hardest hit by the unrest.
   ``It's a disaster. The cancellations are coming in a murderous
rhythm. I'm losing hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' said Shimon
Shtern, a hotel owner and chairman of the Hotel Association in
Netanya, a popular Mediterranean resort.
   Shtern's 150-room Netanya Hanesicha hotel is operating at 10
percent of capacity, and 63 hotel employees have been fired this
month as a result.
   Shtern says each time his office telex switches on, his hopes
rise. ``The telex starts up, we all get excited, and it's another
cancellation. We don't even ask the reason anymore,'' he said.
   By comparison, 1987 was a record year for Israeli tourism, with
1.52 million visitors bringing in $1.6 billion.
   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir got the first
official look at the advertising campaign, slated for Europe and
the United States under the slogan: ``Israel: See for Yourself.''
   The ads feature television endorsements from American tourists
saying how safe Israel's popular vacation spots are.
   ``The idea we're selling is Israel isn't just the West Bank.
It's Masada, Eilat, Jaffa oranges, all these wonderful things,''
said Al Lieberman, president of New York-based Grey Advertising,
one of the companies involved in the campaign.
   ``When there's a crisis on, we can't compete with the front
page. But after people read the headlines, these ads say: `Forget
what's going on in Gaza, it's beautiful here in Israel,'''
Lieberman said.
   Israel's Tourism Ministry is also treating European and American
travel agents to all-expenses paid tours of Israel to promote the
country. To help Israeli hoteliers, the ministry contributes two
dollars for every dollar an owner spends to advertise his hotel
abroad.
   But some hotel owners have already complained that the $5
million budget for the campaign is not enough to effectively fight
Israel's tarnished image, brought about not only by the unrest but
by the army's handling of it.
   More than 190 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by Israeli
army gunfire, since December. Two Israelis have died.
   ``Five million dollars when we are going to lose hundreds of
millions is nothing. It's a drop in the bucket. If you spend that
little, you might as well do nothing at all,'' said Yehuda
Greenbaum, chairman of the Jerusalem Hotel Association.
   ``What we have today is as much an image problem as a security
problem,'' said Yaacov Katz, marketing manager of the Israel Hotel
Association, which represents the country's 320 hotels.
   ``People are not just worrying about rocks or terrorist acts.
The problem is that in the United States, Israel's image has been
sullied. It's a political problem, something we've never tackled
before,'' he said in an interview.
   Katz believes the lost revenue will amount to $500 million
instead of the $300 million estimated by the Tourism Ministry.
   Twenty percent fewer Americans came to Israel in April compared
with the same month last year, and the biggest decline was among
American Jews, according to Tourism Ministry Spokeswoman Dvora
Ganani-Elad.
   Tourism in March and April slid 23 percent compared to the first
two months of the year, and advance bookings have plummeted. In
Europe alone, about 60,000 people have called off plans to travel
to Israel.
   Tourism buses standing idle in their lots have prompted Israel's
largest bus company, Egged, to announce it will lay off 500
employees. The Hilton Hotel in Tel Aviv has already fired 180
workers and reduced the remainder of its 650-member staff from a
six- to a five-day work week.

   Hail apparently knocked out both engines of a
new Boeing 737, forcing the jet to glide to a landing on a narrow
strip of grass 20 miles short of New Orleans' airport, a federal
investigator said today.
   Passengers broke into applause for the pilot who safely brought
down the TACA International Airlines jet Tuesday without injury to
the 40 or so people aboard the flight from El Salvador to New
Orleans.
   ``Apparently the pilot ran into a hail storm and that knocked
the engines out,'' said J.O. Johnson, an investigator with the
National Transportation Safety Board office in Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``The damage that was caused by the denting of the (jet turbine)
blades was probably the major factor in the loss of power,'' he
said.
   The 3-week-old Boeing 737-300 jet remained on the grassy strip
where it glided to a stop between an irrigation canal and a ship
channel. Johnson said the NTSB, Federal Aviation Administration and
TACA officials are investigating.
   ``I suspect they'll probably grade (the strip) down and fly it
out later,'' Johnson said. ``Except for the engines, the plane
apparently suffered no damage.''
   At the time of the flight, the entire Gulf region was under
National Weather Service warnings for severe thunderstorms,
including hail and high winds, for several hours. Storm clouds were
reported as high as 50,000 feet.
   ``The plane was going up and down, sideways, and twisting,''
said the Rev. Leo Humphrey, 52, a Baptist missionary. ``Lightning
was everywhere. The lights went out on the plane and the engine
died. Everyone thought it was over.
   ``As the pilot said, `By the grace of God, I got this sucker on
the ground,''' Humphrey said after the smooth landing.
   TACA, based in San Salvador, El Salvador, has business offices
in New Orleans. The flight had made a stop in the Central American
country of Belize.
   The TACA plane was at 11,000 feet when it was diverted 15 miles
to the Naval Air Station at suburban Belle Chasse, said a source
with the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The pilot then managed to restart both engines, the source said,
and asked for clearance to New Orleans International before power
went out again.
   Flying at about 5,000 feet, the pilot then was diverted 6 miles
away to the less congested Lakefront Airport, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The pilot responded with two ``Mayday'' messages and began
looking for somewhere else to land, the source said.
   The plane came to a stop on the grounds of a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration complex in eastern New
Orleans, five miles short of Lakefront Airport. The wings barely
fit between the drainage canal and the levee.
   Officials have put the total number of passengers and crew
aboard the craft between 45 and 36.
   Two witnesses said they heard no engine sounds as the plane
landed.
   Saidy Duran, 35, of Costa Rica said she and other passengers
showed their appreciation with a round of applause _ ``a big one.''
   The pilot, Carlos Dardano, about 35, is from San Salvador and
has been with TACA about five years, said Peter Messina, the
airline's U.S. regional manager.
   ``He's a pretty cool captain. He doesn't get flustered very
easily,'' Messina said.
   Crew members refused to talk with reporters.
   ``We went through rain and severe turbulence and I thought I
heard them say lightning hit the plane,'' said passenger July Mora,
25, of New Orleans.
   Officials could not confirm the report.

   Twenty employees of Kansas' largest
employer, Boeing Military Airplanes, were suspended without pay for
allegedly using or dealing drugs on company property.
   An investigation into selling, buying and using cocaine and
marijuana on Boeing property started several weeks ago, said Allen
Hobbs, a company spokesman.
   A Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said one of the 20
people was arrested. Possible charges are being reviewed by the
Sedgwick County district attorney's office.
   Hobbs said the investigation is continuing. He would not say
what jobs the suspended workers held, but said they weren't
sensitive. Two are supervisors, he said.
   The company's drug policy is posted throughout the plant, Hobbs
said.
   ``We just want to be seen as tough on drugs,'' he said. ``We
don't want it on our property.''
   Boeing Military Airplanes employs more than 20,000.

   House Speaker James C. Wright Jr. reported
six-figure earnings last year but nothing from his paperback book,
according to financial records of all House members made public
today. Wright's book figures in a call for a House ethics committee
investigation.
   Incomes of more than $100,000 were the rule for House members,
whose official salary was $87,483 in 1987. But there were some
exceptions.
   The government watchdog group Common Cause has asked for the
probe into Wright's earnings from ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
Published reports have said that Wright has been paid royalties of
55 percent from the 1985 book, far above the normal 10 percent to
15 percent authors receive.
   Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer last week asked for an
investigation of whether Wright's campaign committees were involved
in publishing or selling the book, which could be a violation of
House or other federal conflict-of-interest rules.
   The Texas Democrat indicated today that publication of the book
had been halted at his orders.
   The speaker said that long-time campaign supporter William
Carlos Moore, who published the book, ``wanted last year to reprint
20,000 more and I said no.'' Wright added that he wanted to be free
to concentrate on being speaker.
   ``I told Carlos, it's just not worth it,'' Wright said. He said
he bought $1,300 worth of books in the last few days to be handed
out to House members.
   Wright also sent a letter Tuesday night to the ethics committee
promising his cooperation if there is an investigation.
   ``Although I know my actions have been in full accordance with
House rules, I am concerned that the matters raised ... have led to
increased public discussion, which I believe is unwarranted,'' he
said.
   ``Therefore, I wish to inform you ... that I will cooperate
fully with any examination you may desire to make of these matters.
I hope that any such review will be resolved promptly,'' he said.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has said he will make a formal
request for an ethics investigation. If a member makes a request,
the committee is required to respond.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., has declined to
comment on the possibility of such a probe by the panel, which
works in secret.
   The financial disclosure forms for Wright and other House
members were made public today.
   Wright's disclosure form showed his income to be between
$168,311 and $176,808. His salary as speaker is $115,000. His
assets were between $155,000 and $435,000 and his liabilities
ranged from $105,000 to $220,000. He transferred investments valued
between $140,000 and $385,000 to a qualified blind trust last year.
   He received $45,850 in honoraria from such lobbying groups as
the American Public Transit Association, the American Hospital
Association, the National Association of Realtors and the Coalition
Against Regressive Taxation.
   Wright gave $13,000 of the honoraria to charity to bring him
below the limit on speaking fees _ 30 percent of House pay _
allowed to congressmen.
   House Democratic leader Thomas Foley and Republican leader
Robert Michel also reported incomes well under $200,000.
   Foley of Washington said his earnings were in the $141,500 to
$151,500 range. He had $28,627 in speaking fees and $100,000 to
$150,000 in assets. That was offset by liabilities in the $50,000
to $100,000 range.
   Foley bought and sold numerous blocks of stock. In January, he
bought $8,347 worth of shares in Home Shopping Network and sold it
20 days later for a $6,185 profit. He took a $7.25-a-share loss on
500 shares of Price Co. stock three days after the Oct. 19 market
crash.
   Michel, of Illinois, reported income of $167,087 to $183,585. He
had $61,250 in honorariums, of which he gave $32,500 to charities.
   Michel said he received golf clothing and accessories for his
participation in three charity golf tournaments.
   Among House members reporting the least income were Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who reportred earnings in the range of
$94,071 and $95,020, including $6,537 in speaking fees. He said his
assets were under $15,000 and that he had no liabilities.
   Rep. Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., reported receiving a maximum
$99,108 income and Theodore S. Weiss, D-N.Y., listed a top of
$92,283. Weiss's single honorarium, $150, was for an article for
The New York Times.
   Indiana Democrat Andrew Jacobs went far beyond the reporting
requirements, listing $111,358 in ``gifts'' in addition to his
$118,556 income. The gift figure represented the value for the free
defense he received from a Wahsington law firm in a libel case
brought by evangelist Pat Robertson. Jacobs won the suit, but still
had to pay $14,000 out of his own pocket for legal fees. And once
again, Jacobs claimed his dog, a Great Dane named Friend, as a
``priceless'' asset.

   Nearly 200 federal, state and local judges
joined the family and friends of slain federal Judge Richard
Daronco today to mourn a man praised for living a life ``of justice
and holiness.''
   Daronco, 56, was shot to death Saturday by a retired New York
City policeman distraught over the judge's dismissal of a sex
discrimination lawsuit brought against a bank by the officer's
daughter, authorities.
   Charles Koster, 67, of Bath, Pa., committed suicide immediately
after killing Daronco, who was appointed last year to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York.
   About 400 people crowded into St. Catharine's Roman Catholic
Church in this affluent New York City suburb, while 300 others
gathered in the cafeteria of a neighboring school to watch the
funeral on closed-circuit television.
   ``Richard Daronco was a great success in this world,'' Monsignor
Philip Murphy said at the Mass.
   The judge, said Murphy, was a ``wonderful, loving and devoted
husband and father ... son and brother, friend and relative. He was
an excellent judge. ... He lived a life of justice and holiness.''
   Among those attending the funeral were U.S. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R.-N.Y., who recommended Daronco for nomination to the
federal bench, and Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the Southern
District.
   Koster, who had used up his life savings on his daughter's
7-year-old suit, shot Daronco as he tended his garden. After
chasing Daronco into his home, Koster turned the gun on himself.
   The slaying was only the second of a federal judge this century.

<HEAD>Psychiatrist Receives Liquid From Woman In School Shooting Rampage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist who was treating Laurie Dann
received a drink container this week from the woman who went on a
shooting rampage at a Winnetka, Ill., school, and the liquid will
be tested for poison, the FBI said.
   Ms. Dann is believed to have delivered arsenic-laced snacks to
two fraternities and several families for whom she had worked as a
babysitter before the rampage Friday.
   An 8-year-old boy was killed in the shooting spree at Hubbard
Woods Elementary School, and five other children were wounded. Ms.
Dann, 30, then wounded a young man in a home nearby and killed
herself.
   University of Wisconsin-Madison psychiatrist John Greist, who
was treating Dann, received the container Monday at his office, FBI
agent Kent Miller said.
   Greist, a specialist in phobias and depressions, did not drink
the liquid, said police Capt. Jeffrey Frye. The container was given
to the FBI.
   Greist, contacted at his office Tuesday, said only that Ms. Dann
was being treated as an outpatient at the Psychiatric Research
Institute, which is affiliated with the university.
   An FBI search of Dann's apartment Friday uncovered a lab coat,
powders and capsules, and library catalog cards describing books on
poison, Miller said.
   Also found were papers from which the FBI compiled a list of
people to whom Dann may have sent poisoned food, Miller said.

   A court on Wednesday convicted a Chinese
businessman of sedition and sentenced him to nine years in prison
for trying to buy goods for China in Taiwan.
   High Court officials said Liu Kuo-wei, 41, an executive of the
Ta Lien Co. in the Portuguese territory of Macao, came to Taiwan to
make the purchase in December 1986. They said he used a false Thai
passport and tried to buy 3,000 tons of tin plates for a Beijing
metal company.
   The deal fell through because of a disagreement over price,
officials said.
   They said Liu, a Chinese citizen, was arrested when he visited
Taiwan again in November.
   The Nationalist Chinese government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949
when it lost a civil war to the Communists, bans direct trade
between Taiwan and China. But it allows indirect trade through a
third country.

<HEAD>Joni Mitchell, America, to Get Tax Money Back from State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a state agency to return
about $800,000 in sales taxes he said was wrongfully imposed on
singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell and the rock group America.
   An attorney for Miss Mitchell and America said the decision by
Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz could open the way for
recoveries by other recording artists.
   The state had assessed the 6 percent sales tax on the theory
that artists ``sell'' their master recordings to record companies
in exchange for royalties. The state called the master recordings
``tangible personal property.''
   Attorneys for Miss Mitchell and the duo America, composed of
Gerald Beckley and Lee Bunnell, had argued that they were not paid
for their master recordings but rather for personal services and
are thus not subject to a sales tax.
   The state Board of Equalization began applying the sales tax to
recording artists in the early 1970s.
   State legislation prohibited the practice in regard to records
issued after Jan. 1, 1976, but the board continued to tax artists
on recordings made before that date.
   Attorney Paul Hall told Daily Variety on Monday that several
other performers, including Neil Young, have litigation that could
be affected by the case decided May 4.

<HEAD>North Korean Threats Being Taken Seriously, US Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planners of the Summer Olympics in South Korea
are treating threats of attacks by North Korea with ``total
seriousness'' a high-ranking State Department official says.
   Undersecretary of State Edward J. Derwinski, who has been
representing the United States in international Olympic
discussions, said in an interview on Tuesday there is an
``extraordinary potential threat posed by the North Koreans.''
   Concern about North Korean moves to disrupt the games has been
heightened since late 1987, when that communist country was blamed
by U.S. officials for the bombing of a South Korean jetliner with
115 people aboard.
   Asked if security officials remained concerned that North Korea
might try to disrupt the Seoul Olympics, Derwinski said, ``We're
taking them (possible threats) with total seriousness, logically
so.''
   North Korea's realization that South Korean organizers are
planning the games ``in a very excellent fashion'' has ``increased
the frustration and bitterness of the North Koreans,'' Derwinski
added.
   North and South Korea have been bitter foes since the late 1940s
when the country was partitioned. Even if the Olympics weren't
being held in Seoul, South Korea, there would still be worries
about terrorism by well-known nationalist groups.
   ``You have this increase in Sikh terrorism, the lashing out at
almost any Indian; the Armenian terrorists periodically try attacks
on Turks; the IRA and their activities; the PLO _ going back to
Munich _ all of these are inherently out there: the Japanese Red
Army, the Italian Red Brigades,'' Derwinski said.
   He said South Korea has been working on security since 1984 and
should be able to handle the job when the games are held Sept.
17-Oct. 2.
   ``I see no problem that I would attribute to indifference or
complacency,'' Derwinski said. ``The problem would be just how
efficient the overall operation is, pitted against whatever actions
a couple of terrorist groups might take.''
   Despite the concern about North Korean disruption efforts,
Olympic organizers are keeping the door open to that country's
participation in the games, even though the official deadline for
signing up passed in January.
   ``Quite frankly, I think if the North Koreans announced the day
before the games that they were sending down 500 athletes, they
would come across the border unmolested,'' Derwinski said.
``There's no real deadline.''
   Cuba, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Seychelles and Ethiopia have also
failed to sign up for the games. Derwinski said he was not
optimistic Cuba would decide to take part, because of Cuban leader
Fidel Castro's close ties to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   ``If Castro were being practical rather than having a dogmatic,
we're told, special relationship with Kim Il Sung, he'd have in
mind the excellence of the Cuban boxing team, their volleyball
team, their men's handball team, some of their track and field
people, plus baseball,'' Derwinski said.
   ``Keeping in mind the excellence of these athletes it would be
to his advantage in terms of international stature to have them on
center stage. ``He (Castro) seems to have his priorities screwed up
right now; I guess we can't be too optimistic.''

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers To Test Blood Of 10,000 Inmates For AIDS Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The blood of 10,000 new inmates from across the
United States will be tested this summer as part of an effort to
measure the spread of the disease among prisoners.
   ``This study is not intended to identify people or identify risk
groups,'' said Joanne Ullrich, coordinator of the project at Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health. ``The purpose of the study is to
find out the prevalence rates of human immunodeficiency virus
infection of people coming into the prison system so the systems
can plan for what they are coming up against.''
   The study is being funded under a $332,000 grant from the
federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The blood samples will be coded to ensure neither inmates nor
prison officials learn who is infected, Ms. Ullrich said.
Information about sexual orientation or drug use will not be
collected.
   The prisoner's age, gender, entrance date, length of sentence
and offense will be known. That will give prison officials a broad
profile of HIV-infected patients, researchers said.
   Results should help prison officials project the number of
inmates who may eventually develop acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and, in turn, plan services and prevention programs, Ms.
Ullrich said. Doctors are unsure exactly what percentage of
HIV-infected people will develop AIDS, but many experts believe the
figure is at least half.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a variety of infections.
   Dr. T. Forham Brewer, medical director of the Maryland Division
of Correction, said the study is the first survey of HIV-infection
among inmates in a geographically diverse slice of the nation's
prisons.
   In a survey by the National Institute of Justice, AIDS cases in
prisons rose 59 percent in the year ending Oct. 1, 1987 (from 1,232
to 1,964 cases), compared with a 61 percent increase in the general
population (26,002 to 41,770). The survey was based on reports from
70 federal, state and local correctional systems.
   The survey, however, did not measure the prevalence of HIV
infection in the prison population, the only reliable predictor of
how many inmates may develop AIDS.
   The Johns Hopkins study will screen the blood of 1,000 inmates
entering each of 10 prisons. The study will be repeated next year.
Hopkins investigators have said they not identify the prisons until
the study is complete.
   Participating prisons will siphon off a small amount of the
blood that is already routinely drawn to test for syphilis,
gonorrhea, anemia and other diseases. The samples will be shipped
to Johns Hopkins.

<TEXT>
   Many of the nation's pollution-fighters at the
headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency have been
gasping and wheezing from an air pollution problem apparently
caused by new carpeting.
   Sixty-five employees have sought medical attention and seven
can't enter the building at all because of their reactions when
they do, William Hirzy, president-elect of Local 2050 of the
National Federation of Federal Employees, said Wednesday.
   Hirzy said he was ``90 percent certain'' the reactions came from
exposure to phenylcyclohexene, a gas given off by the backing of
new rugs the agency has been installing in the building used by
5,100 employees.
   ``From talk in the halls, I would guess that the number affected
is at least 100,'' but not all have reported to the agency's health
office, Hirzy said.
   The agency has stopped putting in new carpets, but Charles
Grizzle, assistant administrator for administration, said
phenylcyclohexene had not been fixed definitely as the cause of the
problem and ``I don't see any reason to rip up the carpets until we
are sure.''
   So far, tests have shown ``nothing above background levels of
any toxic chemicals,'' Grizzle said, but the results of tests for
phenylcyclohexene are not yet known. Hirzy said tests of the air of
a warehouse containing about 175 remaining rolls of carpet showed a
concentration of 60 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. The
odor of the gas can be detected at concentrations of as little as 1
ppb to 3 ppb.
   About 100 rolls of carpet already have been installed.
   Little is known about the effects of phenylcyclohexene and there
are no standards for workplace exposure, but there is ``some
indication'' that it damages lung tissue and intestinal mucous
membranes in laboratory animals, said Hirzy, a chemist.
   The agency has not yet decided what to do about the seven
employees who can't enter the building. Some are on sick leave,
some are using vacation time and some are being permitted to work
at home, Hirzy said.
   Grizzle, however, said, ``We are giving our employees the
maximum relief we can and help with workmens' compensation cases at
the Labor Department'' while the agency tries to decide on a policy.
   EPA has asked the government's housekeeping agency, the General
Services Administration, for space elsewhere if it is forced to
relocate employees, he said.
   Hirzy said the union had been pressing for removal of the new
carpets, but was rebuffed in a ``very stormy'' meeting of the
union-management facilities advisory committee on April 28.
   EPA officials proposed to steam-clean the new carpets, air them
out and re-lay them, Hirzy said. ``Not only will it not work, it
doesn't make sense from a public policy standpoint. It's not the
job of government employees to be used as test animals.''
   Industrial hygienists say the ``sick building'' problem like
EPA's is often caused by poor ventilation. Grizzle said, ``I have
asked our folks to make sure we are doing everything we can to
improve ventilation. I am told the dampers are open as far as they
can go. I am just a layman, but it does seem to me we lack fresh
air in here.''
   The EPA building, which was constructed in 1971 near the
waterfront in the city's southwestern section, is almost totally
sealed. Many of EPA's employees work in cramped quarters in offices
without windows, and those who rank high enough to rate a window
find they cannot open it.
   Grizzle said the agency has 125 square feet per employee, below
the 135 square feet GSA specifies for new offices.

   Carroll Douglass Bing kept her husband out late
in violation of a court order and then got into a scuffle with a
nurse, leading to her second arrest, police said.
   The wife of former Metropolitan Opera impressario Sir Rudolf
Bing was charged with violating the court order of protection and
third-degree assault, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   She was supposed to have her 86-year-old husband, who suffers
from Alzheimer's disease, back to their apartment by 9 p.m., but
was about two hours late Tuesday, said O'Donnell, who did not know
where the couple had been.
   ``Then when she did return, she got involved in a dispute with a
40-year-old nurse,'' pushing her against a wall and bruising her
head, he said. The nurse declined treatment.
   Security guards at the apartment house called police, he said.
   Mrs. Bing, 48, was arrested May 12 after she allegedly violated
the court order issued three days before by state Judge Carmen
Ciparick. The judge ordered that she stay away from her husband for
six hours a day so nurses can care for him.
   The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to prosecute
her at that time.
   Mrs. Bing is in a civil court fight with her husband's lawyer,
who charges she has abused Bing and has asked the judge to annul
the Bings' 1{-year-old marriage.

   Actor Peter O'Toole's 5-year-old son, Lorcan, flew
to New York on Wednesday with his mother, former model Karen
Somerville.
   A British judge ruled Tuesday that the boy should return to the
United States with his mother so U.S. courts can determine custody.
   Ms. Somerville did not speak to reporters at London's Heathrow
Airport before boarding a flight to New York.
   Ms. Somerville, 37, and O'Toole, 55, have been fighting over
their son since they parted in 1983. A U.S. court already has
granted joint custody.
   High Court Family Division Judge Sir Stephen Brown ruled in a
private hearing Tuesday that it was in the boy's best interest that
he be returned to his mother's care in New Jersey pending another
court hearing there.
   The Irish-born O'Toole refused to return the boy when a
scheduled 10-day visit to Britain ended earlier this month, lawyers
for Ms. Somerville said.
   O'Toole is known for such films as ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and
``The Lion in Winter.''

   Life spans up to 200 and plentiful food, but
a growing gap between rich and poor _ those are among the
predictions for the year 2038 from some prominent people.
   Those forecasts _ offered by authors, scientists, sports figures
and entertainers _ were sealed Tuesday in a time capsule to be
opened in a half-century.
   The event was part of the 4th annual L. Ron Hubbard Writers of
the Future awards ceremony. Hubbard, a science fiction writer and
the Church of Scientology founder, died in 1986.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize
winner, said the gap between rich and poor will increase over the
next 50 years and be reflected in such things as the way food is
distributed.
   ``There is plenty of food. But it is being distributed
unfairly,'' Arias said. ``I don't see compassion replacing greed.''
   Thomas R. McDonough of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena predicted humans can look forward to long lives. ``The
average lifespan will be 200 years, and some people alive in 2038
will live for millions of years,'' he said.
   And those people will be living in beautiful new communities,
said noted science fiction author Ray Bradbury, who anticipates
``every American town and city rebuilt, brand-new and beautiful.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Backs Proposal for Visas to Those Separated by Amnesty
Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman said Wednesday he favors a
proposal by immigration officials to set aside up to 200,000 visas
to spouses and children who didn't qualify for amnesty but whose
relatives did.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he plans to incorporate the
plan of the Immigration and Naturalization Service into legislation
he introduced with two other congressmen.
   ``It's humane, it's progressive, it's an excellent program and
it will make the lives of hundreds of thousands of people easier''
because it will keep family units together, said Schumer.
   Under the visa plan favored by INS, once an illegal immigrant
obtains permanent residency under the amnesty program, immediate
family members would qualify for permanent resident status rather
than facing lengthy waits.
   The average wait for legal status for immigrants from most
countries is 1{ years and there is a 10-year wait for spouses and
children of permanent residents who want to immigrate to the United
States from Mexico.
   The INS says the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does
not allow it to grant a special benefit to ineligible family
members and that the agency must treat each case individually. The
INS is allowing relatives to remain in the United States
indefinitely for humanitarian reasons under voluntary departure
status.
   The 1986 law allows illegal aliens who came to the United States
before Jan. 1, 1982 and who have lived here since to qualify for
amnesty under a one-year program that ended May 4. Some 1.6 million
people applied.

   Questioning of prospective jurors for
former Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial neared completion today,
with one woman making the first cut after saying she was
embarrassed by some of his remarks in office.
   ``He didn't seem to have tact in talking to people,'' said the
prospective juror, who added that she voted for Mecham in 1986. She
mentioned his description last year of the United States as a
``Christian'' nation and added, ``I did feel some embarrassment.''
   However, the woman said she wondered whether Mecham was ``set
up'' in his impeachment trial, which concluded with the state
Senate removing him April 4. She said she believed she could be
fair, and was accepted as a possible juror.
   Mecham and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, Willard, are
charged with concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Sixteen prospective jurors were chosen Tuesday, and the
questioning could be completed today. Maricopa County Superior
Court Judge Michael Ryan said he probably would stop when 24
acceptable panelists are found.
   Peremptory eliminations by the prosecution and defense then
would be the last step in choosing the eight-member jury plus four
alternates.
   Another possible panelist was accepted today after saying she
bought a car from Mecham's Pontiac dealership that ``burned up''
after being serviced there. One man was excused after saying he had
signed a Mecham recall petition.
   Evan and Willard Mecham watched intently today as the judge,
prosecution and defense questioned the individual potential jurors.
   On Tuesday, the former governor told reporters he was ``just a
stoic observer.''
   One prospective juror who was accepted Tuesday said she felt
``sympathy'' for Mecham, while others said they did not believe he
should have faced recall from the governorship so soon after he
took office in January 1987.
   Another prospective panelist said Mecham ``has had a very big
mouth through this whole thing ... (and) got himself into a lot of
trouble because of the way he was so hard-headed.'' Prosecutors
unsuccessfully sought to exclude her.
   One man said Mecham seemed to make ``goofs, mistakes, errors,
bad judgment, that has nothing to do with his integrity.''
   All the prospective jurors, however, said they believed they
could be fair in the trial.
   Mecham faces six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment
and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in prison if
convicted on all counts. His brother faces three similar counts and
up to 9{ years if convicted of all three.
   The former Republican governor and his brother have denied all
wrongdoing in failing to report the loan from a Tempe developer.
   Opening statements are scheduled for June 2, the day after the
Arizona Supreme Court is to hear arguments on the defense's request
that the charges be returned to the state grand jury for a new
determination of probable cause.
   The original pool of 99 possible jurors was narrowed to 51 on
Monday after lawyers and Ryan examined questionnaires filled out
last week.
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 when the state Senate
convicted him on two impeachment counts of misusing a protocol fund
and of obstructing justice. He was impeached in connection with the
$350,000 loan, but the Senate decided not to hear the charge for
fear of prejudicing the criminal trial.

<HEAD>Plan Floated To Abduct Suspected Terrorist In France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intelligence operatives floated a plan in 1985
to send agents to France to seize a man believed to be behind the
kidnapping of Americans in the Middle East, but the State
Department torpedoed the proposal, a U.S. official and a broadcast
report said Wednesday.
   American intelligence received word in the autumn of 1985 that
Imad Mugniyeh, a Lebanese Shiite linked to terrorist attacks, was
visiting France and proposed that he be abducted to the United
States for trial, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The State Department, fearing the action would cause a major
blowup in U.S.-French relations, argued successfully against the
plan and a decision was made to ask French authorities to arrest
Mugniyeh. France did not act on the request, the official said.
   National Public Radio, which first disclosed the plan in a
broadcast Wednesday morning, said its sources disagreed on whether
President Reagan approved the plan. At any rate, the broadcast
said, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and FBI Director William
Webster scuttled the proposal.
   NPR said the idea was conceived by William J. Casey, then
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, but that it was never
completely proven that Mugniyeh was in France at the time his
abduction was to be carried out.
   In early 1986, following a second report of Mugniyeh's presence
in France, local authorities did act on the U.S. request and went
to a hotel to arrest him. But instead of a Lebanese terrorist,
police found a family of vacationers, NPR reported.
   Mugniyeh has been identified by U.S. terrorism experts as the
leader of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group held responsible
for the kidnapping of westerners in Lebanon, including Associated
Press Chief Middle East Correspondent Terry Anderson and several
other Americans.
   Mugniyeh is under indictment in the United States on charges of
participating in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the
killing of Navy diver Robert Stethem, one of the passengers.
   State Department officials have also said they suspect that
Mugniyeh was involved in last month's hijacking of a Kuwaiti
jetliner, which was held for two weeks by gunmen demanding the
release of more than two dozen Shiite Moslems being held on
terrorism charges in Kuwait. Mugniyeh's brother-in-law is said to
be one of the prisoners.
   The plane hijackers disappeared in Algeria after they released
their remaining hostages.
   The U.S. official who spoke of the proposal to abduct Mugniyeh
said ``there's always a lot of brainstorming about this sort of
thing. It was an idea that was floated. People were saying, `How
can we do this?'''
   ``The State Department felt strongly that if something like this
was to be done it could not be through secret connivance _ there
had to be a decision by French political authorities to arrest him
and turn him over to the United States,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tax Threat Was Key To Defeat Of New City Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STATELINE, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear of higher taxes was the key factor
behind voters' rejection of the proposed new city of Lake Tahoe,
spokesmen for both sides said.
   The measure, which was fought by local hotel-casino interests,
lost by a 1,001-802 vote in a special election Tuesday in this
mountain resort area.
   The proposed city would have embraced the casino area of
Stateline and smaller communities along about 15 miles of Lake
Tahoe's southeastern shore. It would have had a population of about
6,500.
   ``The tax scare did it,'' said Bill Bigham, a leader of the
movement to create the city. He also blamed casinos for the outcome.
   ``The casinos scared their employees into voting against the
city, saying there would be chaos,'' said Bigham, a local bank
manager.
   The leader of the opposition, Ron Nino, said he was very pleased
with the vote. ``Our arguments were more credible, particularly
regarding a tax increase,'' he said.
   The opposition's vigorous advertising campaign received
financial support from the Stateline casinos, whose tax burden Nino
said would rise by at least $300,000 yearly under a city government.
   Commissioners of Douglas County, which would have lost about
$1.8 million in yearly tax revenue to the city, mostly from the
large Stateline casinos, had advised voters to reject the plan.
   ``We believed there was going to be a substantial tax
increase,'' said Nino, who runs a property management business.
``People will pay more for more but we didn't see where there was
going to be more. We saw the same or less.''
   The proposal lost in all the lakeshore communities, although
proponents had argued that those communities, which comprise 25
percent of Douglas County's population, do not receive a share in
services proportionate to the tax revenue they contribute.
   The issue prompted an unusually high turnout of 60 percent, said
Douglas County Clerk Barbara Reed. She said a normal turnout was
35-40 percent.

   Three men stole 81 pay telephones, altered
their electronics and reinstalled them elsewhere, enabling one of
the thieves to continue collecting callers' money, police said.
   The alleged ringleader, Lou Vagnoni, 60, changed the locks on
the coin boxes, removed labels identifying the owner and changed a
computer chip inside, police said.
   The telephones were valueda at $265,275; the amount of money
received by operating them illegally could not be determined,
police said.
   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker and District Attorney Ronald
Castille charged Tuesday that Vagnoni paid Robert Paige, 31, and
David Olsen, 22, to steal phones for him at $150 each throughout
Philadelphia.
   The stolen telephones were then operated by Need-a-Phone, a
Philadelphia pay telephone company in which Vagnoni is a silent
partner, police said. Other partners were unaware of the
activities, police said.
   About one-quarter of the telephones belonged to Bell of
Pennsylvania, while the remainder belonged to members of the
Central Atlantic Pay-Phone Association, a network of private
companies that operate pay telephones.
   The three men were charged with 60 counts each of theft,
conspiracy and unlawful use of computers.
   The case broke in February when police Sgt. Terry Levins spotted
Paige and Olsen dislodging a telephone and its steel base, said
Detective Philip Silverman. An investigation traced the men to
Vagnoni, he said.
   ``Bystanders would spot the two men, but they appeared to be
utility people,'' said Deputy Police Commissioner Willie Williams.
   ``It was when the owners of the equipment came by to service the
phones and found the equipment gone that a pattern began to be
noticed.''

   A Palestinian general strike shut down the
occupied territories Wednesday and the Israeli army imposed curfews
that confined 200,000 Arabs to their homes.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, chief of staff, said the army has punished
dozens of soldiers for violating orders since the Arab rebellion
began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   He did not elaborate, but the army has issued rules on when
soldiers are allowed to fire on or beat protesters.
   Shomron also said the violence has lessened the influence of
Jordan's King Hussein in the territories, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war, and undermined his
usefulness in peace negotiations.
   ``The uprising in the territories has weakened Jordan's ...
position as a potential partner for negotiations,'' he told foreign
reporters. ``We hear voices today that King Hussein is retreating
from positions he had taken before the uprising began.''
   Soldiers shot a Palestinian youth during a clash with young
Arabs hurling rocks and bottles in the Nur Shams refugee camp near
Tulkarem in the West Bank, the army said. Officials at Rafidiyeh
Hospital in Nablus said he was critically wounded in the chest.
   Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded since the rebellion began
among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. At
least 195 have been killed, and an Israeli soldier and a Jewish
settler also have been slain.
   Indefinite curfews were imposed on the Dheishe refugee camp in
the West Bank and on nine camps and villages in the Gaza Strip.
   Underground leaders called the one-day strike in a leaflet
signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization to mark the end of
mourning for Khalil Wazir, the PLO military commander, 40 days
after he was assassinated at his home in Tunis.
   Wazir, whose code name was Abu Jihad, spent his boyhood in Gaza
City. His cousin Ahmed Wazir, who lives there, said soldiers barred
mourners from attending a reception in the slain leader's honor.
   ``The army is outside our house,'' Ahmed Wazir said by telephone
from his home, where the reception was to have been held. ``They
turned back anyone who came here.''
   He said 10 army jeeps and other military vehicles were outside
his house and soldiers with megaphones ordered all residents on his
street to remain indoors.
   Stores were closed throughout the territories and in Arab east
Jerusalem, which Israel took from Jordan in 1967 and has formally
annexed. Public transport was halted and most Palestinians who have
jobs in Israel stayed home.
   Vendors selling newspapers and doughnut-shaped bread covered
with sesame seeds, an Arab staple, provided the only signs of
commercial activity.
   Classes were conducted at kindergartens and elementary schools
in the West Bank, which were allowed to open Monday for the first
time in nearly four months.
   Olivier Rafovicz, spokesman for the military government, said
about 90 percent of the 200,000 students showed up Wednesday.
``This shows the strengthening of the military government,'' he
said.
   In the leaflet that called the strike, however, underground
leaders said the school re-opening was a victory and urged children
to attend.
   Israel radio said the army threatened Arab property owners with
up to five years in jail if they failed to wash anti-Israeli
graffiti off their buildings and remove Palestinian flags, which
are outlawed by Israel.
   Army spokesmen had no immediate comment on the report, which
also said those who did not comply could be fined 15,000 shekels
($9,670).
   A Jewish settler was charged with manslaughter Wednesday in the
fatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd May 5 near Shiloh, a
Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Israel radio reported.
   It quoted the charge sheet, Yisrael Zeev fired at Arab shepherds
despite their shouts that they would stop grazing sheep on disputed
land near Shiloh, the radio said. One shepherd was killed and
another wounded.
   Government prosecutors also charged two editors of the left-wing
newspaper Derech Hanitzotz with membership in a guerrilla
organization and maintaining contacts with a foreign agent, the
radio said.
   Yaacov Ben Efrat and Assaf Adiv, and two other staff members
charged earlier this week, face up to 40 years in jail if
convicted. They are accused of belonging to the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO faction, and meeting
with Arab guerrillas in London.

president in January, an official report said Wednesday.
   Lee, the first native Taiwanese president of Nationalist China,
has toured military establishments seeking to win popularity since
he succeeded the late President Chiang Ching-kuo.
   Gen. Hau Pei-tsun, 69, chief of the military's general staff
since 1981, remained in his post. He is believed to support the new
president.
   The Central News Agency said Adm. Yeh Chang-tung, 59, was named
navy commander-in-chief, succeeding Adm. Liu Ho-chien, 62.
   Gen. Huang Hsing-chiang was appointed army commander-in-chief,
replacing Gen. Chiang Chung-ling, 66. Chiang was appointed senior
vice chief of the general staff.
   Huang's age was not available, but officials said he is in his
late 50s or early 60s.

   The former Conrail engineer at the controls
during the worst crash in Amtrak history pleaded guilty today to a
federal charge of conspiring to obstruct an investigation of the
wreck.
   Rick Gates, 34, already is serving a five-year prison sentence
after pleading guilty to a state charge of manslaughter for running
a string of locomotives past a signal and into the path of an
Amtrak passenger train.
   Sixteen people were killed and 175 were injured in the Jan. 4,
1987 crash near Chase, Md.
   Gates could receive up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine at sentencing July 15.
   Gates' public defender, Fred Warren Bennett, called the federal
charges ``morally unjust.'' Gates was indicted March 31, two days
after pleading guilty to the state charges.
   ``It amounts to kicking the dog when he's down,'' Bennett told
U.S. District Judge Norman Ramsey.
   In exchange for his guilty plea to conspiracy, charges of
obstruction and making false statements were dropped. Under the
plea bargain, Bennett said, prosecutors will recommend a five-year
sentence to be served after Gates' state term.
   Gates was accused of lying to National Transportation Safety
Board investigators in denying that he and brakeman Edward Cromwell
had smoked marijuana while operating the train.
   The federal indictment also accused Gates of lying about having
tested cab signals to make sure they were in working order.
Cromwell received state and federal immunity for his cooperation in
the investigation.
   The crash prompted the introduction of federal legislation to
tighten regulation of train crews.
   The legislation, passed by the House on Monday, would require
train licenses for engineers, make it illegal for crews to tamper
with safety devices and give the government more clout in handling
safety violations.
   The Senate is expected to approve the legislation this week as
well.
   Gates, in state court, admitted he failed to replace a cab
warning light bulb and fix a whistle that was taped over to keep it
from sounding. Either warning device would have alerted him to the
stop signals, officials said.

   Residents of the Lemington Home for the Aged
released more than 500 balloons May 1 in search of pen pals, and
they're feeling inflated by the results.
   The balloons carried messages inviting whomever found them to
write a letter, and two letters arrived in response.
   The missives delighted the residents, especially Rebecca Hayden,
84, who heard from a woman in Morgantown, W.Va., said activities'
director Chaunita Burnett.
   ``She was really excited. She was showing it around ...
grinning. She's one of those chipper people anyway,'' Ms. Burnett
said Wednesday. ``It was a nice letter.''
   The balloons, released to commemorate Older Americans Month,
also brought a letter from a couple in Masontown, W.Va.

   Harry and Alma Meyers and Merrel and Mary
Welage were married in a double-ring ceremony and had their first
and last children within six weeks of each other.
   Now they're getting together again _ to celebrate their 50th
wedding anniversaries.
   ``Before I could tell her I was pregnant, she told me she was
pregnant, too,'' said Mrs. Meyers, now 76.
   Mrs. Meyers and Mrs. Welage are sisters. Their husbands have
been friends since childhood in Cincinnati's Western Hills
neighborhood, where the couples still live. For years, the four
shared a house.
   The couples started celebrating Saturday with a party, and they
plan to return Saturday to St. Francis DeSales Church, the site of
their wedding, for a special Mass.
   ``Everyone wants to know how we did this, but it's just
coincidence,'' said Mrs. Welage, 74.
   The only thing the sisters actually planned was the
double-wedding ceremony on May 28, 1938.
   Meyers and Welage, both 73, presented the sisters with
engagement rings on Christmas Day in 1936 and 1937, respectively.
   ``We had a double wedding to spare my father the expense,'' said
Mrs. Meyers. ``We had the same dress when we got married. We bought
the material, and a dressmaker made them for $10 each. Can you
imagine?''

   Economist John Kenneth Galbraith says he and a
Soviet counterpart, in collaborating on a new book, found that both
their countries are experiencing what they call superpower syndrome.
   Galbraith and Soviet economist Stanislav Menshikov, who have
known each other for more than 20 years, wanted to find out whether
each could write fairly about the other's economic system,
Galbraith said.
   Under a joint publication agreement, the book, ``Capitalism,
Communism and Coexistence: From the Bitter Past to a Better
Prospect,'' is being released in both the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   Today, Galbraith said, there are many similarities between the
United States and the Soviet Union, and the book offers hope that
both sides can work together.
   One of those similarities, he said, is the ``superpower
syndrome.''
   ``Both powers, the United States in Vietnam and the Soviet Union
in Afghanistan, have recently collided with the determination of
other peoples everywhere to conduct their own governments and run
their own lives,'' he said.
   Galbraith, 79, and Menshikov, 61, were in Chicago on Wednesday
to discuss the book at an awards breakfast sponsored by Clergy and
Laity Concerned, an interfaith group.
   The book is compiled from discussions Galbraith and Menshikov
conducted at Galbraith's summer home in Vermont.
   ``We wanted to see whether we could write a book that dealt
fairly and squarely with the problems of the two systems,''
Galbraith said Tuesday night in a telephone interview from his
hotel.
   Galbraith said the topics of the discussions include past
achievements of socialism and capitalism, the current problems of
both systems and suggested reforms for those problems.
   Galbraith, a native of Canada, has taught at Harvard and
Princeton universities and is the author of more than 20 books on
economics and other subjects. He has also held a number of
governmental posts including that of ambassador to India from
1961-63.
   Menshikov is staff editor of the World Marxist Review, published
in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and author of a number of books,
including an economic comparison of the United States, the Soviet
Union and Japan.

<HEAD>Hindu Migrant Workers Flee Punjab After Sikh Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARBAKSH SINGH NANDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAJJAT, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Hindu migrant workers are
fleeing Punjab following attacks by Sikh extremists who are waging
a war of terror in their quest for a separate homeland.
   Police say 65 migrant laborers have been killed by Sikh gunmen
in the past week.
   ``Even if I have to die at this age, I must die among my
relatives,'' said Piara Ram, 26, who was leaving for his home in
Uttar Pradesh state. ``There would be someone to cry for me.''
   The migrant workers' departure could seriously undermine
Punjab's economy.
   The Punjab Labor Department estimates the state employs about
700,000 migrant workers a year, most for planting and harvesting in
the nation's richest agricultural state.
   Several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about
one-third have left since the Sikh extremists' raids escalated
earlier this month. The state government acknowledges laborers have
returned home but gives no figures.
   Construction work has nearly stopped on a major canal designed
to carry Punjab river water to neighboring states, and even migrant
rickshaw pullers and other manual laborers are leaving.
   Although radical Sikhs have frequently attacked Hindus in their
six-year struggle for greater autonomy or an independent nation in
Punjab, they started singling out Hindu migrnt laborers during the
police siege of the Golden Temple. The 10-day siege, aimed at
driving armed Sikhs out of the shrine, ended May 18 after more than
200 Sikh extremists and their supporters surrendered.
   Although Punjab officials have pledged to protect the migrants _
who come mainly from the poor northern states of Bihar, Orissa and
Uttar Pradesh _ many say they are returning home rather than face
more terrorism by Sikh extremists.
   Police say the attacks may have a dual purpose: to reduce the
number of Hindus in Punjab and to undermine the state's economy.
   The attacks began May 17 when 31 men and women working on the
Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal were shot to death by Sikhs at their camp
near Majjat, 30 miles northwest of the state capital at Chandigarh.
The gunmen then burned the bodies.
   Seventy other camp workers fled to nearby fields and hid from
the gunmen. A day later, they begged the government to arrange for
their return to Bihar and Orissa states.
   The attack was claimed by the Khalistan Commando Force, one of
the largest of a dozen Sikh extremist groups active in Punjab. In a
note left with the bodies, the group said it avenging the siege of
the Golden Temple and threatened more reprisals.
   The charred bodies of the 31 laborers remain in the deserted
campsite, and bloodstains still can be seen on the muddy footpaths
leading to their tents.
   The canal project they were working on has lost almost 7,500 of
its 10,000 workers, according to figures provided by the canal
headquarters at Chandigarh.
   The Sikh militants, and some Sikh moderates, oppose the canal
because it is designed to carry water from Punjab to the
neighboring states of Haryana and Rajasthan. The militants contend
it will reduce the water available for irrigation in Punjab, a
``breadbasket'' state of wheat fields, rice paddies and sugar cane
plantations.
   Romesh Kumar Sharma, a contractor on two bridges being built
along the canal, said work was all but stopped on the canal and
could not be resumed unless the migrants were lured back to the
project.
   The average migrant worker in Punjab earns betweeen $38 and $46
per month. Most send money home to support their families. Jobs in
their native states are hard to find and pay much less.
   Lubhaya, a rickshaw puller, worked for seven years in Ludhiana,
the district capital, but was at the railway station this week
waiting for a train. He said he was leaving ``the death land of
Punjab'' for good.
   Ram Kumar Sharma, owner of a brick kiln in Ropar District just
north of Chandigarh, said many of his 35 migrant employees have
left. Chaman Lal, another kiln owner, estimated that two-thirds of
the district's 1,700 migrant kiln workers have fled.
   An official at the state's Home Ministry, which is responsible
for internal security, said special camps would be set up for
migrants to make them feel more secure.
   In Ropar District, Deputy Commissioner J.R. Kundal said security
would be provided for the canal workers' camps, and he urged
laborers to stay.
   ``If you don't work here, what will you or your family members
eat?'' he asked them. He did not say when the security would be
provided.

   Rising production costs and cutbacks in
federal payments are keeping up the pressure on farmers this year,
says a new outlook report by the Agriculture Department.
   Net cash income of farmers is forecast at $50 billion to $55
billion this year, down from the record of $57 billion in 1987, the
report released Tuesday said. That is unchanged from USDA's
previous forecasts.
   The department's Economic Research Service added that underlying
the forecast are improvements in several of agriculture's key
fundamentals:
   _ Use of most of the major commodities has increased, thereby
reducing burdensome stockpiles.
   _ Market prices for those commodities are approaching or are
higher the government's support levels.
   _ Higher cattle prices have offset minor declines in production.
   _ Interest rates have continued to be moderate.
   _ Total farm debt is declining for the fifth consecutive year,
indicating further gains in the financial position of operators.
   ``Production expenses are expected to rise, after declining at
an unprecedented rate the last three years,'' the report said.
   Spring fertilizer prices were up 10 percent from a year ago, and
those ``will be felt most by corn and barley producers, whose
outlays for fertilizer make up 38 percent and 30 percent,
respectively, of variable costs,'' the report said. ``The Corn Belt
will be the region most affected.''
   Energy expenses may rise about 5 percent this year, with cash
grain, and cattle and hog operations accounting for more than 60
percent of fuel costs last year. Again, the Corn Belt will be most
affected.
   Thus, the drop in 1988 net cash income _ the difference between
gross cash income and cash expenses _ will be mostly due to higher
cash expenses outweighing greater cash receipts from the sale of
crops and livestock.
   Further, the report said, direct payments to farmers in 1988 are
expected to drop by as much as 20 percent from last year's $17
billion.
   Despite the dip in cash income this year, analysts said the
balance sheet of U.S. agriculture continues to show improvement
from the hard-pressed economy of a few years ago.
   ``With improving income, lower debt and adequate credit for farm
real estate loans, buyers are coming back into the real estate
market,'' the report said. ``With recent improvements in cash flow,
many land sales have been for cash.''

   The Agriculture Department has hired a new
administrator for the Agricultural Research Service under an
arrangement that gives him an annual benefits package worth
$126,500 a year at taxpayer expense.
   Ronald D. Plowman, 59, is leaving his job as head of the
department of animal, dairy and veterinary sciences at Utah State
University to take over the Agricultural Research Service, or ARS,
at a salary of $77,500. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
announced the appointment on April 15.
   But that is only part of the story, says Ed Curran, a retired
USDA editor who writes a twice-monthly newsletter that often
includes gadfly accounts of department goings-on.
   Curran disclosed in his latest issue that Plowman will continue
to draw a federal pension of about $35,000 a year, earned in 27
years on the job with ARS from 1956 to 1984, when he retired and
went to work for Utah State.
   The Plowman job package involves an ``IPA'' maneuver provided by
the federal Intergovernmental Personnel Act, which allows state
governments to get the loan of federal experts or send their
employees to Washington on a short-term basis.
   In this particular case, confirmed Tuesday by agency officials,
Plowman technically will be on loan from the university, which will
pay his salary while in Washington. The USDA, in turn, will
reimburse the university $77,500 a year.
   Plowman also will get $14,000 a year in federal per diem to help
pay moving expenses and make up for higher living costs in the
Washington area.
   Normally, Plowman would give up his federal retirement income
while returning to work at the USDA agency. But under the IPA
arrangement, Plowman will be able keep his pension income. Although
the ``loan'' deal with Utah State is for a year, officials said the
contract is renewable on the same terms.
   Thus, Plowman's prospective income of $126,500 a year is
substantially more than Lyng's pay of $99,500 or members of
Congress, who get $89,500 a year.
   If Plowman converts over to federal employment, severing his
connection with Utah State, he automatically would be cut off from
his old pension benefits _ at least until he retires again from
federal service.

   Rains last month brought temporary relief to
many parched areas of the West where the outlook for this summer's
water supply had been poor, says the Agriculture Department.
   ``While drought continues in many areas, it certainly is good to
see an increase in rainfall,'' Wilson Scaling, chief of the
department's Soil Conservation Service, said Tuesday. ``We're
hoping this change will develop into a long-term pattern.''
   Scaling said precipitation in April was near to above normal in
most areas west of the Rocky Mountains. The Columbia Basin got
above-normal precipitation, and Arizona received twice its April
average.
   ``Reservoir storage is very good in the Colorado and Rio Grande
basins,'' he said. ``We also expect reservoirs in Arizona and New
Mexico to fill.''
   But Scaling said the water supply outlook in other areas is not
nearly so bright.
   ``Some areas in Montana will be facing water supply shortages as
early as next month,'' he said. ``There are also sections of
California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Washington that remain very
dry despite the recent increase in precipitation.''
   Scaling added: ``It's going to take a lot more than just one
good month of precipitation to ease the drought in those areas.''

<HEAD>Israeli Diplomats Going to Moscow for First Time 21 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel will send diplomats to Moscow to take up
consular duties for the first time in 21 years, a Foreign Ministry
official said Wednesday.
   Another Ministry official told Israel army radio he hoped the
agreement between the two countries would eventually lead to full
diplomatic ties. The official, political adviser Nimrod Novick,
declined to describe the pact as a breakthrough in Soviet-Israeli
relations.
   ``What we are talking about is dipping ourselves in the water to
check if it is hot or cold,'' he said. ``It remains to be seen when
our delegates reach Moscow, how well they will be received.''
   The Soviets agreed to issue visas to the Israeli diplomats
during a secret meeting Monday in Zurich, Switzerland, Novick told
the station.
   The other ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said diplomats from the Jewish state could leave for the Soviet
capital as early as next week.
   The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel when the Jewish state
captured the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights from
the Kremlin's Arab allies in the 1967 Middle East war.
   This week's agreement came 10 months after Soviet consular
officials began operating from the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Novick, who negotiated for the visas, said the Soviets resisted
Israeli efforts to have the diplomats handle visas to Israel for
Soviet Jewish emigres. ``It looked like it was broadening things to
the Soviets,'' he said.
   But he added that the Soviets agreed not to restrict other
contacts between the Israelis and Soviet Jews.
   Israel's diplomats will administer an embassy building that has
been vacant since 1967 but for which Israel has continued to pay
monthly rent, Novick said.
   The diplomats, up to six in number, will work from the Dutch
Embassy, where visas for Jewish emigres are processed, according to
sources quoted by Israeli media.
   The agreement followed two months of secret contacts with
Vladimir Terrasov, deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
Middle East Department, Novick said.
   In the past two years, Kremlin leaders have improved ties with
Israel to try to gain a role in peace efforts in the Middle East.
That led to the agreement nearly a year ago for the eight-member
consular team to come to Israel.

   The Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on Reagan administration and
Noriega:
   The Reagan administration ... reportedly has offered to dismiss
15 indictments brought against Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega by
grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., if he will resign as
Panama's military commander ... and leave the country until after
the 1990 presidential elections.
   Somebody must be kidding.
   Noriega is accused ... of taking $4.6 million in payoffs from
Colombia's violent Medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments,
launder money, supply drug laboratories and shelter the gang's
leaders from law enforcement.
   Why should it bother him to go into ``exile'' until 1990? He
will simply leave his corrupt cronies in place to keep the drugs
and money flowing, while he serves his time in some pleasure spot.
   President Reagan's ``war against drugs'' has been anything but
successful and dismissing the indictments would indicate the United
States condones drug trafficking.

   Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the addictiveness of
smoking:
   On the surface, the essence of the U.S. surgeon general's annual
report on smoking _ that nicotine is potently addictive _ is
nothing new. Anyone who has ever smoked regularly then tried to
stop knows painfully well the hold nicotine has on people.
   Yet this year's report equates the addiction of nicotine to that
of heroin and cocaine, and in the process raises some eyebrows.
   Can it really be as difficult to give up smoking as it is to
stop shooting up with heroin?
   With such a comparison isn't there a danger that now smokers
will begin to be equated with drug users and, perhaps, shunned by
employers _ when their functioning under the influence of nicotine
has no relation to one's functioning under that, say, of heroin?
   Adults who choose to indulge their habit ... ought to be free to
do so, except in outlawed premises, for in their cases they are the
only ones affected.

   Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch on the ouster of Hungary's party
leader Janos Kadar:
   (Janos Kadar's) successor as Communist Party chief, the
reputedly pragmatic Karoly Grosz, urges faster moves to a freer
market, and a party more open to dissent _ but only, of course,
from within.
   It is Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's experiment on
a smaller scale. ...
   His loyalty to Moscow is assured: He first made his mark in the
party on the Soviet side in the 1956 revolution.
   He has considerable experience as the party's agitation and
propaganda chief, useful skills in attracting the attention and
assistance of a sympathetic West and in deflecting internal
criticism.
   Just the man for Mikhail Gorbachev to wish well, and watch
closely.

   The student was barred from seeking office as student council
president after he said in his campaign speech that it is

   Individuals who view their garbage as being forever theirs
should be aware that things have changed.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled ... that trash placed outside for
the weekly pickup is not covered by the Fourth Amendment's
protection against illegal search and seizure by police. ...
   Anyone who has ever had a nighttime visit by roving mutts knows

have ``no expectation of privacy'' when they haul their trash out

   If Attorney General Ed Meese is an honorable man, he should see
that now is the time for him to step aside.
   While Meese has not been convicted or even indicted for any
offense, he has at the very least been guilty of poor judgment.
   Meese's effectiveness has been lost as he has to spend virtually
all of his time responding to the various ongoing investigations
concerning his conduct while in government.
   If Meese is really concerned for the good of his country, then
he should see that it is time to go.

   Advocates of oil drilling and development on the wild coastal
plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge like to imply that
people in the oil states support the proposal.
   This newspaper in this oil state does not support the proposal;
in fact, we believe the coastal plain should be placed _ as the

   Alamogordo (N.M.) Daily News on a proposal to legalize drugs:
   Election year posturing drives politicians' anti-drug rhetoric
to hysteria levels, some very extreme and absurd ideas have gained
unwarranted respectability.
   Chief among these is the notion that legalizing heroin, cocaine
and other addictive substances will alleviate America's alarming
drug problem.
   The logic behind this proposal is identical to giving a drunk
another drink to cure his alcoholism.
   Making illicit narcotics legal, and thus cheaper and even more
readily available, would not discourage drug abuse.
   On the contrary, legalization would cause consumption to soar
and magnify to a dangerous degree the full range of personal and
societal destruction caused by drug use.

   Baltimore Sun on apartheid:
   The newest debate over economic sanctions against South Africa
raises familiar questions about the effectiveness of sanctions and
the impact on the people they are designed to help.
   It also raises anew the issue of where the United States should
stand in the battle over apartheid, the racist system upheld by the
white-minority government in Pretoria. ...
   Two sweeping sanctions bills have been introduced in Congress.
Both would bar most U.S. trade with South Africa and require
American firms to withdraw their investments.
   The new sanctions would be much stronger, but if the United
States is alone in imposing them, legitimate questions can still be
raised about their effectiveness against a determined Pretoria
government and eager investors from other countries.
   It also is fair to ask how the sanctions would affect blacks,
since their victimization by the apartheid regime is the source of
U.S. concerns.

   The San Luis Obispo (Calif.) Telegram-Tribune on removing
Noriega:
   The Reagan Administration has made a mess of its attempts to
oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's drug-dealing dictator.
   Each day seems to bring a new proposal, the latest being that if
Noriega steps down, his hand-picked president could remain in
office until elections are held next year.
   That makes even less sense than a White House offer to drop the
drug charges against Noriega if he'll get out of office and
eventually out of the country entirely. ...
   Sol Linowitz, former ambassador to the Organization of American
States and perhaps the most respected U.S. observer of Latin
American affairs, proposes that the Reagan administration practice
mediation rather than muscle.
   Let's enlist the help of neighboring Latin states in trying to
talk sense to Noriega, says Linowitz. ...
   Noriega is not likely to leave in the face of the bully tactics
that have been tried by the White House. Also, the sanctions have
hurt the Panamanian people more than their self-styled leader,
stirring bitterness against the United States. ...
   Getting him to take a walk will require a bunch of carrots
rather than a bundle of sticks.

   The Dallas Morning News on George Bush:
   Vice President George Bush finally stepped outside the shadow of
President Reagan, however slightly, on the issue of Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Noriega and drugs.
   That should encourage supporters who have watched Bush continue
to sink in the polls. The latest Gallup Poll has Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis leading Bush nationally by 54 to 38 percent. ...
   Pollsters also are finding out that voters believe the Democrats
are handling the drug issue better than the Republicans.
   So Bush said recently that as president, ``I won't bargain with
drug dealers ... whether they're on U.S. or foreign soil.''
   He said the anti-drug effort he has spearheaded wasn't enough,
and he outlined a program in which the vice president would be the
``drug czar'' in a Bush administration.
   It's time that George Bush stop hiding behind the cloak of his
``loyalty'' to President Reagan and establish his own identity.

   The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald on the Supreme Court decision on
trash:
   The U.S. Supreme Court was too cavalier with individual rights
when it ruled police are free to search through barrels and bags
people leave out for trash collection.
   The decision, made in regard to a 1984 narcotics case in Laguna
Beach, Calif., allows police to search through garbage without a
warrant and without any reason to suspect criminal activity. ...
   It is disturbing that a majority on the Supreme Court believes
most Americans wouldn't object to police picking through their
trash without a warrant on a fishing expedition for evidence that
might implicate them in a crime. ...
   The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution reads, ``The right of
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
EFFECTS against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be
violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by oath and affirmation and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be searched.''
   Does a majority on the Supreme Court believe most Americans do
not consider their trash as part of their effects?

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on congressional
appropriations:
   Members of Congress hoping to dip into the congressional pork
barrel this year for new water and energy projects will find
themselves on a well-deserved starvation diet if the House
Appropriations Committee has its way.
   The committee decreed, for the first time in the memory of those
who serve on it, that no money will be appropriated for the next
fiscal year to start construction of new water or energy projects.
   It isn't that the committee has suddenly become allergic to
``pork.'' It's just that committee members felt constrained to
honor a two-year agreement reached at last December's White
House-Congress budget summit to keep costs down to reduce the
federal deficit. ...
   But this being an election year, few politicians are eager to
endorse increased taxes, even to satisfy the desires of House and
Senate members who gain bragging rights for federally funded
projects that benefit their districts and states. ...
   It's gratifying that, however brief and limited it may be, the
House Appropriations Committee decided to give taxpayers a break
from higher pork-barrel spending.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on George Bush:
   (Last) week (George) Bush began the task of cutting the apron
strings.
   Although the Reagan administration is apparently willing to drop
drug trafficking charges against Panama strongman Manuel Noriega if
he'll relinquish power, Bush has declared he would never negotiate
with drug dealers.
   The conflict doesn't bother the president. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater says the president takes no offense, adding that
``I expect a number of them (Bush's positions) will be different
than existing policies'' during the campaign. ...
   There are other good reasons for Bush to stop masquerading as
Son of Reagan.
   First, it's not all positive. Reagan's refusal to fire Attorney
General Edwin Meese III is a millstone around Bush's neck. So are
charges that the Reagan administration had links with Noriega.
   Beyond that, however, although he's been in government for
decades, Bush has never articulated clearly where he stands in
terms of political philosophy. He's drifted from one administration
to another, his beliefs often shifting with political winds.
   Cutting loose from Reasgan provides Bush with the opportunity to
develop his own clear agenda in a post-Reagan presidency. And he's
got to if he is to have any hope of succeeding the boss.

   The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle on Michael Dukakis:
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis says he wants
to ``end Reaganomics.''
   But wait a minute. America is in its 66th straight month of the
longest and strongest recovery in U.S. peacetime history.
   The economy is still creating jobs at a 3 million annual rate
through the first four months, for a record 15.6 million since the
recovery began in December, 1982.
   Incidentally, according to economist Warren Brookes, over the
past year 63 percent of new jobs were ``professional and
managerial,'' and only 1 percent were in ``service occupations,''
thus finally silencing all the yammering about ``hamburger
flippers.''
   Democrats are trying to claim that inflation looms as the nation
moves closer to full employment. The policies of the Federal
Reserve Board, of course, will determine if this could become a
serious problem.
   But Brookes reminds us of some recent history: In the last seven
years, as the jobless rate has fallen two points (28 percent),
inflation as measured by the Gross National Product deflator has
also fallen, by more than 7 points (75 percent).
   Vice President Bush needs to tell voters about it; the liberal
Big Media won't.

   Milwaukee (Wis.) Sentinel on the drug war:
   The wages of sin can be an effective weapon in the war against
crime _ but less so in Wisconsin.
   That's because money or property seized from criminals in drug
raids isn't kept by state or local law enforcement agencies for use
in future drug buys, but is turned over to the state school fund.
   As a result, and because the state civil forfeiture proceeding
takes longer than the federal procedure, local prosecutors often
involve federal authorities in the cases.
   After custody of money has been obtained by federal officials,
they return the cash to local authorities, keeping 10 percent to 20
percent for administrative costs.
   That 10 percent to 20 percent could be used here in Wisconsin if
state law was changed to speed things up and to allow local
agencies to keep the loot they seize. The loss to the school fund
probably would be negligible, considering that local authorities
now use the federal option anyway.
   Far from negligible would be the gain if that money helped
capture another drug trafficker.

   The Reagan administration will begin
purchasing Nicaraguan currency this week for distribution to the
Contra rebels to buy food and clothing, despite a plea from House
Democrats to drop the idea, a spokesman for the aid program said
Wednesday.
   The Democrats met in a closed-door caucus Wednesday and voted to
approve a resolution calling for the cash aid program to be
scuttled and for food and clothing to be shipped through the
Pan-American Development Foundation, or PADF, an agency with ties
to the Organization of American States.
   Both the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government
have made public statements accepting the PADF as the delivery
agent for a $17.7 million humanitarian aid program approved by
Congress earlier this year.
   But a spokesman for the Agency for International Development,
which is administering the aid, said there had been no formal
request from the two sides to establish PADF as delivery agent, and
that the congressional request was premature.
   ``There has to be a formal agreement in place,'' said spokesman
Roger Noriega. ``We have said all along that the neutral delivery
mechanism has to be part of an agreement between the resistance and
the Sandinista government.''
   Noriega added: ``It is wholly unrealistic to expect AID to talk
with the PADF in specific terms until there is a signed agreement
or some kind of reliable public statement.''
   AID plans to begin purchasing cordobas, the Nicaraguan currency,
this week for distribution to rebel troops in the field as early as
next week, Noriega added. Troops will receive about $1 a day each,
he said.
   ``The first purchases will be this week, then you'll see the
first movement across the border next week,'' he said, adding that
the money is to be channeled through the Contra military structure.
   Noriega said it is the rainy season in Nicaragua and that
scheduling of airdrops is unreliable, so that cash aid may have to
continue even after a ``neutral'' delivery agent, as called for in
the legislation, is established.
   The resolution approved by House Democrats contended that ``the
Reagan administration is violating the ... cease-fire agreement and
the U.S. cease-fire assistance program'' by providing cash, sending
aid without inspection by the verification commission and by using
a delivery contractor that does not meet the test of neutrality.
   AID continues to use a delivery company, Circle G,that has past
links to the CIA, the caucus noted.
   The resolution called on the administration to ``make immediate
arrangements for delivery of aid through the Pan-American
Development Foundation.''
   Noriega said AID has so far delivered 600 metric tons of food,
clothing and other supplies to rebel forces inside Honduras through
private contractors.
   The loads delivered so far have been inspected by
representatives of the Roman Catholic church in Honduras to make
sure they contain no lethal supplies, Noriega said. Most of the
deliveries have been made by truck, although there have been about
a dozen airdrops, he said.

   Thives struck museums in two
cities in the days following the biggest art theft in Dutch
history, officials said Wednesday.
   On Sunday, thieves at Amsterdam's Biblical Museum forced open a
glass showcase and stole six antique Egyptian statuettes, according
to the Rotterdam newspaper NRC Handelsblad.
   The bronze and clay figures, worth an estimated $7,800 to
$10,400, apparently were stolen while the museum was open, the
report said.
   The theft came two days after thieves broke into Amsterdam's
Municipal Museum and stole three paintings estimated at up to $52
million, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cezanne. The
theft highlighted the relatively low security at the museum which
houses 3,000 mainly modern masterworks but has no night guard.
   The burglary triggered an electronic alarm, but it took up to 20
minutes for police and security officials to arrive on the scene.
   Later that day, thieves smashed a showcase and stole two jewelry
items in the Dutch Literary Museum in The Hague, according to
museum director Anton Korteweg.
   The stolen cameo brooch and a gold-edged medallion were worth
several thousand dollars, Korteweg told The Associated Press,
adding the incident at his museum also occurred while it was open
to the public.
   The Literary Museum, housed in the ultra-modern Royal Library
complex, has electronic surveillance and a night guard, and owns a
collection of manuscripts, books and other objects associated with
Dutch literary figures.
   The Biblical Museum, which has a collection of artifacts from
the Holy Land, had only one guard on duty at the time of the theft,
the newspaper said.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet economists said Wednesday they have seen
the future and it holds family farms, thriving foreign trade and
rubles acceptable on world markets. One predicted, however, that
the future is not near at hand.
   Nikolai L. Shmelev, told reporters his liberal ideas encounter
opposition that makes him feel like ``a minority of one.''
   He predicted the ubiquitous symbols of the Soviet Union's
economic ills _ long lines or lists for consumer goods _ would be
around for a long time. Shmelev said it would take at least 10
years to catch up with the demand for cars.
   Another economist, Oleg T. Bogomolov, said ``all of us are
suffering, particularly our wives,'' who do most of the shopping.
   Bogomolov was more optimistic. He said lines should become a
memory in five or six years as cooperatives, a form of limited
private enterprise Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev favors, help
meet consumer demand.
   Shmelev, who is with the Soviet Institute of the U.S.A. and
Canada, has published articles in the literary journal Novy Mir
advocating reforms far more radical than Gorbachev's.
   He mentioned two at the news conference Wednesday: selling some
of the Soviet Union's vast gold reserves for foreign currency to
buy consumer goods made abroad, and letting farm families lease
land from the state.
   The economist conceded his proposals had received only lukewarm
support.
   ``At times I find myself in this situation, a minority of one,''
Shmelev said. ``These questions can be discussed, but these are not
yet practical issues.''
   Shmelev has been particularly critical of collectivized
agriculture. He said the country is moving toward increasing the
number of family-run farms because of excessive bureaucracy in
collective operations.
   ``The future belongs to family farms,'' he said, but he does not
envision turning the land over to private ownership.
   Articles have appeared in the official press about agricultural
experiments in which farm families own buildings, equipment and
animals and have long-term leases on land. In collectives, members
of a cooperative own buildings and machinery jointly and share in
the earnings.
   Gorbachev wants to improve the collective farm in its various
forms, including the idea of smaller work teams that would include
the family.
   Making the ruble a convertible currency that could be traded
freely has been debated vigorously in the official press. Some
economists say it would lead to serious inflation problems because
of fluctuations against other currenciews.
   Lack of convertibility hampers foreign trade. Foreign companies
are not eager to earn rubles, which they cannot use outside the
Soviet Union.
   In order to buy the Western technology and products it needs,
the Soviet Union must sell its own goods abroad for acceptable
foreign currency.
   Ivan D. Ivanov, first deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic
Commission, sounded confident that the change would come. ``We want
to be sure our ruble becomes a hard currency,'' he said.
   Ivanov said the ruble should become convertible by the
mid-1990s, first in the Soviet bloc and later elsewhere in the
world, but prices of Soviet goods first will have to be brought
into line with world markets.
   Another Kremlin goal is at least a doubling of foreign trade by
the end of the century, he said. The volume of Soviet foreign trade
with developed capitalist countries was 20 billion rubles, about
$33 billion at the official rate, in the first three quarters of
1987.

<HEAD>Money That Led To Controversial Strip Search Of Students Turns Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUART, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The missing $100 bill that led to a strip
search of high school students and the demotion of the official who
ordered the search was found tucked in a closet of the room where
it vanished last month.
   Martin County High School officials don't know how or when the
money ended up in John Parson's classroom. The bill was still
tucked inside a coin purse.
   ``It's been very painful,'' Principal Wanda Yarboro said
Tuesday. ``After all we've been through, we just want to put it
behind us.''
   She said it appears the coin purse was taken and later stuffed
into a closet.
   ``It definitely was not misplaced,'' Yarboro said. ``But I'm not
going to draw any conclusion, because I don't know. All we wanted
was for the money to be found. It just happened a month too late.''
   Deneen DeShields, 18, reported the money missing during Parson's
cooking class last month.
   A student looking for grill cleaner during a yearly inventory
found the money Tuesday in the rarely used closet, Parson said.
   ``It could have been there all along. I don't know,'' he said.
   Miss DeShields had brought the money to school April 11 to pay
for a trip to Texas with the school's choral group. When she
reported it missing, and a search didn't find her coin purse, the
16 juniors and seniors in the class were locked in the room.
   Dean of Students Michael Lindgren and security personnel
separated the students by sex and searched them. Assistant
Principal J.C. Williams helped in the search, which infuriated
parents.
   The Martin County School Board earlier this month demoted
Lindgren to a teacher and suspended Williams for five days.
   Lindgren was pleased that the money turned up.
   ``That's all I ever wanted,'' he said.

   The Little League Boosters Club is out
its $37,000 savings account and its treasurer, who's suspected of
taking the money.
   Club President Ernie Shultz said the apparent theft came to
light earlier this month when some of the club's checks bounced.
Treasurer Bobbi Sanor was asked to attend a meeting but didn't turn
up, he said.
   Police Chief Harry Montgomery said Ms. Sanor has not been seen
in town since the first week in May. An arrest warrant has been
issued charging Ms. Sanor with embezzlement.
   ``When we called the meeting and told her we wanted to see the
books, she said `no problem.' Then we met and she was gone, and
she'd taken her son out of school, too, '' Shultz said.
   Shultz said the club, which sponsors football, basketball and
cheerleading programs that last year involved about 200 youngsters,
is faced with $20,000 in unpaid bills.
   Shultz said Ms. Sanor was the club's treasurer in 1986 without
any problems. ``She worked real hard, I guess that's what stumped
everybody,'' he said. ``When you get somebody for volunteer work
who works that hard, you don't push them too much, you know. But
we'll be more careful in the future.''
   He said the club is going to become bonded and require two
signatures on all checks.
   He said the club will ``try to have fund-raisers and hope people
will give us money to pull through this. That's about all we can do
right now.''

<HEAD>Truck Deregulation Said Saving Billions Without Hurting Safety,
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The partial deregulation of the trucking
industry has saved the economy tens of billions of dollars a year
while having little effect on safety or service to small
communities, a staff report by the Federal Trade Commission
concluded Wednesday.
   FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver cited the report in calling for the
removal of remaining federal and state economic restrictions on the
commercial trucking industry. His views were endorsed by Heather
Gradison, chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   According to the FTC staff study, between $39 billion and $63
billion are being saved annually because of increased competition
and efficiencies flowing from the partial deregulation of the
trucking industry eight years ago.
   ``The best available estimates ... suggest that the gains have
outweighed the losses by approximately 20 to 1,'' concluded the
report released by the FTC's bureau of economics. The commission
has not formally endorsed the findings.
   The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 greatly eased entry into the
trucking business by making it easier for a trucking company to
begin operating along a particular route. In recent years
applications for a route have been denied only rarely. It also has
become easier for carriers to set their own rates.
   The FTC staff report by economist Diane Owen said the easing of
government control over the trucking industry ``has resulted in new
shipping services and greater scheduling and pricing flexibility,''
leading to increased savings and allowing shippers to better
compete with foreign companies.
   Ms. Owen acknowledged that there have been concerns about
deregulation on some trucking companies as well as about truck
safety and a possible decline in services to small and rural
communities.
   The report said that despite these concerns trucking services to
small communities generally have improved or remained unchanged,
deregulation ``does not appear to have adversely affected safety''
and while many trucking companies have gone out of business the
overall number of companies and employees in the industry has
increased.
   The report said that while interstate commerce has benefited
from deregulation, ``continued state regulation costs consumers and
the economy billions of dollars annually.''
   Oliver called for additional action, ``removing the yoke of
unnecessary economic regulation'' that still exists of the trucking
industry. The Transportation Department has sought further
deregulation of trucking, but Congress so far has not taken action.
   Meanwhile, Oliver said, states should eliminate many of their
retrictions on commercial trucking.
   ``In California it now costs more to ship goods from Oakland to
San Francisco, a distance of 15 miles, than to ship interstate from
Reno to San Francisco,'' Oliver said.

   The late Elivs Presley set attendance
records here that still stand, so it seems the most appropriate
city for a premiere of a show on the life of the king of rock 'n'
roll, a friend of his says.
   Jerry Schilling made the observation Tuesday night as the Las
Vegas Hilton unveiled plans for the stage show ``Elvis _ An
American Musical.''
   ``There's no more appropriate place to premiere a show on his
life,'' Schilling said. ``Elvis played here six weeks at a time,
twice a year. He loved this city.''
   Presley's attendance records at the Las Vegas Hilton remain
unbroken.
   The show's world premiere is scheduled July 1, with the
production running through Aug. 29. Producers plan to take the show
on the road to New Haven, Conn., Houston and Cleveland before the
premiere.
   The multimillion-dollar production will showcase 49 Presley
songs, using old film footage, laser lighting and a cast of 20,
including three people playing Presley at various stages in his
career.
   Schilling and Presley were neighbors in Memphis, Tenn., and
became friends. They worked together 11 years until Presley's death
Aug. 16, 1977.
   Today, Schilling has a talent management agency in Los Angeles.
He was a technical consultant on the television show ``Elvis and
Me'' and is working in a similar capacity on the stage show.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Fifth Summit Could Bring Strategic Missile Treaty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reagan-Summit, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says he may hold
another summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev yet this year to finish
work on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, according
to a published report.
   In an interview with the Die Welt newspaper published in its
Thursday editions, Reagan also said he wants his NATO partners to
pay more of the alliance's expenses.
   The interview was conducted in Washington before Reagan left for
Moscow and his fourth summit with Gorbachev.
   ``President Reagan figures that the START treaty, which foresees
the halving of nuclear intercontinental missiles, still can be
brought to completion before the end of his term,'' the
conservative daily said.
   Advance copies of the report were provided to other media
Wednesday. The German-language excerpts were translated into
English by The Associated Press.
   Die Welt said Reagan told the journalists that the Soviets are
interested in concluding an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
treaty with him, rather than waiting until his successor takes over
in January.
   ``Therefore, the president doesn't exclude the possibility of a
fifth summit conference with Gorbachev this year on neutral
ground,'' the newspaper said.
   Reagan, who left Washington for Finland on Wednesday en route to
Moscow, met with Gorbachev in Geneva in November 1985, in
Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986, and in Washington in December
1987.
   During the interview, Die Welt said Reagan was asked how he gets
along with Gorbachev.
   ``We can discuss delicate issues without lingering on personal
bad feelings. I believe there is actually a certain degree of
friendship between us,'' Die Welt quoted Reagan as saying.
   The newspaper also said Reagan touched on problems facing the
Americans in financing costs of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and urged that other NATO partners share more of the
burden.
   ``I don't think this is an area that should cause bad blood
between us,'' Die Welt quoted Reagan as saying.
   ``But it would be helpful if the allies would carry more of the
load, especially since the American Congress for years has declined
to approve further increases for defense,'' the newspaper quoted
the president as saying.
   Reagan told the reporters he is pleased that Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost, or more openness in Soviet society, has influenced
other East bloc countries.
   Die Welt said Reagan also made reference to last weekend's
Communist Party leadership change in Hungary, in which Janos Kadar,
who had led the party 32 years, was replaced as premier by Karoly
Grosz.
   Reagan said Kadar had ``simply been in office too long,'' Die
Welt reported.

   Asked what chance he saw for the signing of a START treaty at a
fifth summit meeting with the Soviets before he leaves office on
Jan. 20, 1989, Reagan said: ``I can't discount that. I certainly
don't want to say that it is impossible, because I believe we can
exclude signing a START treaty at this summit.''
   ``I believe however, that negotiations in this summit will bring
us further, and I hope that it can be concluded while I am still in
office,'' he told the newspaper.
   ``I also believe that the other side also thinks this way, that
unnecessary delay could be caused if they had to wait until my
successor becomes familiar with the job and is in the position to
work with them (the Soviets).
   ``Therefore, I hope that we can clear up all remaining questions
during my time in office. Then it can be that we decide to sign
this treaty at a new meeting and not separated by thousands of
miles.
   ``Since we have visited each other in our home countries, we
would probably decide on a neutral location,'' for the signing,
Reagan told the newspaper.

   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48
million units last month, following increases of 2.5 percent in
both February and March.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the association, predicted
that sales would be slowed in the months ahead by rising mortgage
rates.
   Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages hit a low this year of
9.84 percent on Feb. 12 and have been rising since then, climbing
to 10.52 percent last week, according to a survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Home prices edged down slightly in April with the median price
of a home falling to $87,700. While this was down $200 from the
March median sales price, it was still up from a year ago, when the
median price was $86,000.
   The slight March-to-April decline in the median price masked
wide regional differences. Home prices rose 5.3 percent in the
Northeast to $145,100, the highest in the country. Prices were up a
slight 0.4 percent in the Midwest to a median of $67,500. Prices
fell 4.6 percent in the West to $113,700 and were down 1.4 percent
in the South to $82,100.
   Tuccillo said the slight overall decline in home prices was an
indication that prices were finally leveling off and would increase
only modestly for the remainder of the year.
   The association is predicting that resales of existing homes
will total 3.31 million this year, down 6 percent from the 3.52
million homes sold in 1987.
   The overall April increase was led by a 6.2 percent increase in
sales in the Northeast, which climbed to an annual rate of 690,000
units.
   Sales were up 5.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of 1.3
million units, while the Midwest had a 2.3 percent increase in
sales to an annual rate of 900,000.
   The West was the only region of the country to have a decline in
sales, a drop of 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 560,000 units.

<HEAD>Two White Policemen Convicted of Murdering Black Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two white policemen were
convicted Wednesday of murdering a black youth in what the judge
described as a wanton ``beating expedition'' in a township.
   Warrant Officer Leon de Villiers and Constable David Goosen
could receive the death penalty. They were expected to be sentenced
later this week after arguments about extenuating circumstances.
   It is believed that no white policeman has ever been executed
for killing a black while on duty in the black townships.
   The trial, which began in October, is one of the few in South
African history in which white policemen have testified against
colleagues facing the death penalty for alleged brutality against
blacks.
   Justice N.W. Zietsman, who presided over the non-jury trial,
said de Villiers had led his 10-man all-white unit into a black
township on a ``beating expedition,'' assaulting residents
indiscriminately.
   He praised police investigators who pressed ahead with the case
after other members of the unit initially tried to cover up the
incident. Fellow officers eventually provided the key testimony
against Goosen, 27, and de Villiers, 37.
   The verdict was to have been delivered Monday, but de Villiers
collapsed in court and was hospitalized. He was present for
Wednesday's proceedings at the Supreme Court in Grahamstown in
eastern Cape Province.
   De Villiers and Goosen had been charged with two counts of
murder in the killings on July 26, 1986, in the black section of
Cradock, a town near Grahamstown. They were acquitted on one count
but convicted of the murder of 18-year-old Mlungisi Stuurman.
   According to testimony, members of de Villiers' anti-riot squad
drank heavily, conducted a blood-oath ceremony swearing themselves
to secrecy, and then made an unauthorized night foray into the
township. Several blacks were assaulted at that time.
   However, after another bout of drinking at their base, the squad
returned to the township after daybreak.
   Stuurman, who was wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan ``Forward
To People's Power,'' was chased and grabbed by officers when he
tried to walk away. Then he was assaulted, several officers
testified.
   The officers said de Villiers then ordered that Stuurman be
``taken out'' because of the severity of his injuries. They said
Goosen took the youth to a riverbank and shot him in the back of
the neck.
   The defendants contended the shooting was an accident. De
Villiers said he did not report it immediately because he was still
under the influence of alcohol.
   In arguing for extenuating circumstances, de Villiers' lawyer
said his client was of below-average intelligence and drunk at the
time of the shooting.
   Goosen testified that he suffered from post-traumatic stress
disorder after repeated exposure to violence in black townships. He
also said he had an unhappy childhood during which he was often
taunted about his dark complexion.
   The convicted men were allowed to remain free on bail of about
$250.

   A World War II veteran accused of
shooting his benefits counselor has been ordered to undergo
treatment at a state hospital after being found incompetent to
stand trial for murder, officials said.
   A jury ruled Tuesday that Rufus William Smith, 63, of Stonewall
was incompetent to stand trial on charges that he killed John
Walker Pettit, 54.
   State District Judge V. Murray Jordan ordered Smith committed to
Vernon State Hospital. Smith had been in the Kerr County Jail in
lieu of $250,000 bond in the slaying Jan. 20.
   Jurors heard two days of testimony before deciding that the
former Marine was incompetent to stand trial now, and that ``there
is no substantial probability that he will attain competency in the
foreseeable future.''
   Pettit was a veterans affairs counselor for the Texas Veterans
Commission who was handling Smith's claims.
   District Attorney Ron Sutton said Smith was enraged by delays in
his medical claims and shot Pettit in the counselor's office near
the Veterans Administration Hospital, as Pettit's wife, Linda, and
other workers watched.
   Testimony Monday indicated Smith believed that VA officials had
been keeping duplicate files on him.
   Smith claimed officials removed information from his records
that showed he killed Japanese soldiers during World War II. He
believed the lack of that information was keeping him from getting
full disability payments, Sutton said.
   Smith, who had undergone treatment at the VA hospital, had
sought full medical disability instead of the partial claims he was
being awarded.
   Dr. Robert G. Harper of the Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston testified that he examined Smith in 1982 and diagnosed him
as a paranoid schizophrenic who believed Pettit was the source of
his troubles.
   Smith's attorney, Scott Stehling of Kerrville, said Smith's
family wanted him to receive treatment.

<HEAD>Former Engineer Pleads Guilty To Federal Charge In Amtrak Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Conrail engineer, already serving a
five-year state prison sentence, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a
federal charge of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of the
worst crash in Amtrak history.
   In exchange, federal prosecutors dropped three other charges
against Rick L. Gates.
   Gates, 33, was sentenced almost two months ago after he pleaded
guilty to a state misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by locomotive
for running a string of Conrail locomotives past a signal and into
the path of an Amtrak passenger train.
   The Jan. 4, 1987, crash near Chase killed 16 people and injured
175 others.
   Former Conrail brakeman Edward Cromwell, with whom authorities
say Gates conspired, received state and federal immunity for his
cooperation in the investigation.
   In the plea agreement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Bernstein
recommended that Gates be sentenced to a five-year prison term to
be served consecutively with his state sentence. The maximum
penalty on the conspiracy charge is five years and a $250,000 fine.
Sentencing is scheduled July 15.
   The charges which were dropped included obstruction of justice
and two counts of making false statements.
   In the statement of facts the prosecutor read into the record
Wednesday, Gates admitted lying on Jan. 7, 1987, to National
Transportation Safety Board investigators about sharing a marijuana
cigarette with Cromwell.
   The statement also said Gates lied about having tested cab
signals to ensure they were in working order and lied about
observing and calling out signals along the route, including a
signal telling the train to slow down and stop, after he smoked the
marijuana cigarette.
   Gates' public defender, Fred Warren Bennett, told U.S. District
Judge Norman Ramsey that the federal government shouldn't have
brought the charges.
   Bennett said the government waited until Gates pleaded guilty to
the state charges, including an extensive statement of facts,
before filing its indictment.
   ``It amounts to kicking the dog when he's down,'' Bennett said.
``He literally gave a written confession to what would be federal
charges.''
   Bennett said, ``In my judgment, the federal prosecution smacks
of both grandstanding ... and pandering to the public.''
   Bernstein said after the hearing he would respond to Bennett's
accusations at sentencing, but added, ``I wonder who's doing the
grandstanding.''
   Gates was indicted by a federal grand jury March 31, two days
after being sentenced and fined $1,000 in Baltimore County Circuit
Court on the state charge.

<HEAD>US Assails Singapore Over Allegations Against American Diplomats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States assailed Singapore on
Wednesday for continuing to allege that American diplomats are
meddling in its domestic politics.
   ``In spite of our denials, the government of Singapore continues
to allege that U.S. diplomats engaged in activities not in keeping
with accepted international practice and interfered in Singapore's
domestic affairs,'' said State Department spokesman Charles Redman.
   ``The United States is not, and has not been, engaged in
interference in Singapore's domestic affairs. All activities of
U.S. government officials in dealing with Singapore have been
legitimate and in full accordance with customary diplomatic
practice,'' he added.
   The dispute centers around allegations by Singapore that
American embassy officers met with Singaporan lawyers and urged
them to run against Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who is expected to
retain control of the island nation's parliament in elections
scheduled for next year.
   The United States contends that its diplomats meet routinely
with members of the constitutional opposition in other countries to
keep abreast of political developments.
   Earlier this month, Singapore asked the United States to remove
one of its embassy officers, and the United States retaliated by
asking for the ouster of a Singaporan diplomat stationed in
Washington.

<HEAD>Office Building Guard Charged in Rape of Attorney</HEAD>

   An attorney working late in her office was
kidnapped and raped repeatedly by a security guard while police
declined to investigate her disappearance, authorities said. The
suspect was arrested by fellow guards shortly after he released the
woman.
   Dwayne Alexander West, 24, a part-time guard for American
Security Corp. of St. Paul, was charged in Ramsey County District
Court on Tuesday with two counts of first-degree criminal sexual
conduct stemming from the incident, which began Sunday evening.
   The victim suffered numerous cuts and bruises during the 13-hour
ordeal, police said. For a time, she was locked in a car trunk,
blindfolded and gagged with duct tape, while the guard completed
his shift at the downtown office building.
   Guards from American Security began searching for West early
Monday after Minneapolis police classified the situation a
missing-person case and declined to launch an immediate
investigation, the security company chairman said.
   Police officials expressed concern about the incident and said
they will be discussing it with the staff members who handled it.
They also said they are investigating possible kidnapping charges
against West.
   Minneapolis Deputy Police Chief Deputy John Laux, who is
handling the case, did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking further comment Wednesday.
   Larry May, chairman of American Security, said Tuesday that he
assigned seven investigators to the case at 3 a.m. Monday after the
victim's husband reported her missing.
   The husband and a guard found blood on a carpet outside the
woman's office and another guard remembered seeing blood on the
hand of a man he relieved.
   West's arrest at about 10:30 a.m. Monday followed a five-hour
stakeout of his apartment by some of the investigators, May said.
   ``We were on our own, so we couldn't do much more than that,''
May said. ``We decided a crime had been committed, but the police
wanted to pursue it as a missing person.''
   Police said the victim went to her office around 6 p.m. Sunday
to catch up on work and was let into the building by a guard.
Shortly after 9 p.m., the guard walked into the office and told her
she would have to leave because of a fire alarm.
   In the hallway, he grabbed her by the neck and then punched her
in the mouth when she screamed. He threatened to kill her and used
duct tape to blindfold and gag her and tie her hands behind her
back. He then took her to his car and forced her into the trunk.
   The guard left her there while he completed his shift, then
drove to an apartment where he raped her at least five times.
   Around 10 a.m. Monday, the assailant agreed to release her. They
left the apartment and the victim was dropped off outside a motel
about five blocks away.
   West was arrested outside the apartment minutes later by two
American Security investigators.

<HEAD>Iraqis Drive Iranians from Marshes East of Basra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraqi forces drove the Iranians from the
marshes east of Basra on Wednesday, dealing Iran its third major
military defeat in recent weeks.
   An Iraqi statement said the Iranians were pushed across the
border after 10 hours of fighting in an offensive called ``On God
We Depend.''
   Iraq also said its warplanes made a long-range bombing raid on
an important power plant near Iran's border with the Soviet Union.
   Iran initially claimed to have repelled the Iraqi assault in the
Salamchah region, which its Revolutionary Guards seized at great
cost in January and February of last year.
   Several hours later, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
announced: ``Following heavy clashes ... the Moslem forces of Iran
had to retreat from parts of the area they had captured before. The
Moslem forces are responding to heavy artillery fire.''
   It said Iranian planes ``heavily bombed'' Iraqi troop
concentrations, inflicting ``substantial losses in men and
equipment.''
   An Iraqi communique distributed by the official Iraqi News
Agency said five Iranian divisions were ``wiped out'' and survivors
retreated across the frontier. It did not give figures, but an
Iranian division usually averages about 10,000 men.
   There was no way to confirm the Iraqi casualty claim. U.S.
military analysts estimate Iran lost at least 25,000 soldiers in
last year's battle for Basra and about 10,000 Iraqis were killed.
   Conflicting reports seldom can be verified because neutral
observers have been allowed into battle zones only rarely since the
war began in September 1980.
   Loss of the bridgehead near Basra would extend a string of
Iranian defeats that began when Iraq's 7th Army Corps, led by elite
Presidential Guards, pushed the Iranians off the Faw Peninsula
south of Basra on April 16-18. Iran had held the marshy finger of
land for two years.
   Also on April 18, the U.S. Navy destroyed two of Iran's offshore
oil Platforms in the Persian Gulf and sank or disabled six Iranian
naval craft in related confrontations.
   Those defeats, combined with economic problems and political
uncertainty within Iran, appear to have put Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's regime on the defensive after a long period of
initiative in the ground war.
   Baghdad said the 3rd Army Corps, again led by Presidential
Guards, moved before dawn to recapture the marshes around Fish Lake
east of Basra.
   Iraq created the artificial lake early in the war as a barrier
to Iranian invasion, but Revolutionary Guards fought through
several Iraqi defense lines last year to take the wetlands.
   A communique from Iraq said its soldiers pushed across the
Jassim and Duaiji rivers around Fish Lake on Wednesday and ``the
Iranian invaders have been defeated and driven outside our
international borders.''
   President Saddam Hussein ``personally supervised the
offensive,'' traveling to the battlefield with his defense
minister, Gen. Adnan Khairallah, the communique said. It did not
elaborate.
   Baghdad radio interrupted regular programs to announce ``a great
victory'' in an ``epic battle.'' Iraqi soldiers in the capital
fired automatic weapons into the air to celebrate.
   Another Iranian report said its army repelled an Iraqi
counterattack in the mountainous Sulaimaniyeh region of northeast
Iraq, where the Iran seized territory several weeks ago. It
reported ``heavy losses and casualties'' among the Iraqis.
   Until the Faw offensive, Iraq had fought a static war since 1982
behind defense lines of heavy artillery, tanks, rocket launchers
and minefields. Their main offensive operation was a bombing
campaign against economic targets and Iranian cities.
   Earlier this week, Khairallah told army commanders to be ``fully
ready'' for new offensives ``if Iran insists on flouting'' a U.N.
cease-fire resolution passed July 20.
   Iraq has said it will abide by the resolution if Iran does, but
the Iranians say there can be no truce until Iraq is designated the
aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border
skirmishes.
   The defense minister said Iraq would seek to regain territory
seized by the Iranians. The Iranians still hold part of the Majnoon
marshes north of Basra and Iraqi territory in the mountainous
Kurdistan region of the north.
   Dispatches from Baghdad said Iraqi warplanes flew more than 600
miles to bomb the Neka power station on the Caspian Sea, 125 miles
northeast of Tehran, ``turning it into ashes.'' The Iraqi air force
also bombed the plant several months ago.
   Iran said bombs struck the homes of workers near the power
station but it gave no details. IRNA said other Iraqi jets raided
Sardasht, a northwestern border town, killing 29 civilians.
   An Iraqi military spokesman said no raids were conducted in the
Sardasht region. He said Iran was trying ``to justify Iranian
bombing of Iraqi residential areas and to cover up its defeats .. .
on the battlefield.''

   Here are capsule summaries of the financial
disclosure forms filed by members of the House from Georgia for
1987 and released Wednesday.
   Income includes the House salary, honoraria earnings from
writing and speeches and other income such as dividends and
interest.
   Earnings by the representatives' spouses and dependents are not
included in the income figure.
   The asset and liability figures for the representatives do not
include holdings and liabilities of spouses and dependents.
   Representatives are permitted to keep honoraria earnings from
speeches and writings up to 30 percent of their salary. For nearly
all members, their salary was $89,500 at the end of 1987. The
speaker of the House was paid at the annualized rate of $115,000
and the Democratic and Republican leaders were paid at the
annualized rate of $99,500.
   Many members receive honoraria above the limit and donate the
excess to charity.
   In their financial disclosure forms, representatives are allowed
to list income, assets and liabilities by ranges instead of
specific figures. However, some representatives provide specific
figures.
   In their listing of assets, representatives do not have to
include their personal residences and vehicles. Gifts, though

   The relatively light vote behind George
Bush's easy victory in Idaho's presidential primary raised
Democratic hopes that Michael Dukakis could claim the state's four
electoral votes in November.
   However, GOP leaders pointed out that Idaho has landed in the
Republican column every presidential election since Lyndon
Johnson's 1964 national landslide.
   Bush captured 82 percent of the vote in a GOP primary that was
barely contested. Pat Robertson, who pulled out of the campaign
earlier this month, split the other 18 percent with an uncommitted
bloc.
   The result was the vice president adding 15 of the 18 nominating
delegates at stake to his total that already exceeds the number
needed for the nomination.
   Unofficial returns from Tuesday's balloting showed Bush, who
campaigned in the state during two days three weeks ago, receiving
nearly 56,000 of the less than 68,000 Republican votes cast.
   Four years ago, by comparison, President Reagan got 97,000 of
106,000 votes.
   ``George Bush cannot and never has been able to generate
enthusiasm and strength as Ronald Reagan has, and a lot of people
didn't care enough about him to go to the polls,'' Democratic Gov.
Cecil Andrus said Wednesday.
   ``I think that shows the Dukakis candidacy will do much better
than any other Democratic candidate has for years in Idaho,'' said
Andrus, who endorsed Dukakis three weeks ago.
   The Democratic primary was only a popularity contest with no
delegates at stake. Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, won it
easily with 73 percent of the vote.
   That overwhelmed the support he garnered seven weeks earlier in
the county caucuses where he captured eight convention delegates
while six went uncommitted and four backed Jesse Jackson.
   Turnout on the Democratic side was about 51,000. That was down
3,500 from the primary four years ago when Gary Hart of neighboring
Colorado was trying to wrest the Democratic nomination from Walter
Mondale.
   Republicans on Wednesday were saying little about the primary
results, though some contended the low turnout was due to a lack of
contested state races.
   ``There just wasn't a big incentive for Republicans to get out
and vote,'' Republican Sen. Steve Symms said.
   Symms said of the all-but-certain GOP nominee, ``If he brings
out who the individual George Bush is he will win. By fall the vice
president will be able to carry a large vote.''

1987 and released Wednesday.
   Income includes the House salary, honoraria earnings from
writing and speeches and other income such as dividends and
interest.
   Earnings by the representatives' spouses and dependents are not
included in the income figure.
   The asset and liability figures for the representatives do not

annualized rate of $99,500.
   Many members receive honoraria above the limit and donate the
excess to charity.
   In their financial disclosure forms, representatives are allowed
to list income, assets and liabilities by ranges instead of
specific figures. However, some representatives provide specific
figures.

   Jacobs listed exact amounts and items for which no reporting is

automobiles, and home and office furnishings. The $111,358 he
reported as ``gifts'' was an estimate of the value of his defense
without fee by the Washington law firm of Arnet, Fox, Kintner,
Plotkin & Kahn in a libel case brought by evangelist Pat Robertson.
Jacobs won the case, but still had to pay $14,000 for other
expenses.
   This was the case that revolved around Jacobs' tip to reporters
that Robertson had bragged that his father, a U.S. senator, had
pulled strings to keep Robertson out of combat in Korea. Robertson
later dropped a similar action against McCloskey.
   Jacobs counted himself extraordinarily wealthy, since he claimed
his dog, a Great Dane named Friend, as a ``priceless'' asset.

<HEAD>Hearing Opens on Recruit's Swimming Pool Death</HEAD>

   A hearing on whether six sailors should
face court-martial in the death of a recruit who drowned during
training in a swimming pool opened Wednesday with the investigating
officer ruling to keep the proceedings open.
   Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2
while receiving air-sea rescue training at the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Five swimming instructors are accused of dragging Mirecki into
the pool and holding his head under water while struggling with him
until he collapsed and later died. The sixth man charged is their
commanding officer.
   A cause of death is not mentioned in the charges against the six.
   Military lawyers for two of the instructors argued Wednesday
that the hearing should be closed because extensive press coverage
may prejudice a future court-martial panel.
   Lt. Cmdr. Larry D. Wynne, the goverment's lawyer, argued to keep
the hearing open.
   Daniel J. D'Alesio, Jr., the investigating officer, agreed,
saying such hearings are traditionally and presumptively open and
public access promotes fairness and confidence in the military
legal system. However, he reserved the right to close portions of
the hearing.
   ``I think the law is clear: If there is any closure it is to be
done with a scalpel, not an ax,'' D'Alesio said.
   Lynn Johansen, Mirecki's sister, and her husband, Lawrence,
attended the Wednesday session. Navy officials have denied charges
by the Johansens that they were slow to investigate Mirecki's
death. Charges were filed May 10 after two months of investigating.
   The Johansens said during the investigation that the Navy
refused to confirm or deny accusations by Mirecki's classmates that
the recruit was roughly treated by instructors just before his
death. The Johansens said the students told them they were ordered
to turn their backs to the pool while the instructors kept Mirecki
in the water and sing ``The Star Spangled Banner'' to drown out his
screams.
   ``I think what pushed us all along is that we lost our Lee and
that's what we're looking for _ not for revenge or anything _ but
we still are driven by wanting to know the true facts,'' Mrs.
Johansen said late Tuesday.
   Other action Wednesday was limited to lawyers' objections to
various statements collected by investigators. Another procedural
hearing is scheduled Friday beause two defense lawyers were unable
to be present Wednesday.
   D'Alesio, of the Naval Legal Service Office in Philadelphia,
said the hearing then will recess until June 4, when the first
witnesses are to testify.
   Petty Officers 1st Class David J. Smith and Richard E. Blevins,
Petty Officers 2nd Class Michael W. Combe, Frankie D. Deaton and
John W. Zelenock are charged with involuntary manslaughter and
conspiracy to commit battery. Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in
charge of the school, is charged with dereliction of duty.
   Rear Adm. David R. Morris, chief of naval air training,
headquartered in Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered the hearing, known
as an Article 32 investigation, or the military's equivalent of a
grand jury inquiry.
   D'Alesio will recommend whether the charges against the sailors
should go to court-martial, be dismissed or handled through
non-judicial means. His recommendation is not binding; Morris makes
a final decision.
   The Navy first told the Johansens that Mirecki's death was
accidental and attributed it to natural causes, something that a
spokesman for Morris says was an error resulting from a
misunderstanding by Navy legal officials in Washington, D.C.
   If found guilty at a court-martial, the accused instructors
could be dishonorably discharged and Torchia could be dismissed,
the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge for officers. The
instructors also face up to three years in prison on the
involuntary manslaughter charge and six months for the conspiracy
count. Torchia could get a maximum of three months.
   The Swimmer School has been closed since Mirecki's death. Navy
and Coast Guard rescue experts began meeting Monday to considered
changes in the school's curriculum and procedures. Vice Adm. N.R.
Thunman, chief of naval education and training, has said the school
may reopen June 15.

<HEAD>Vietnam and U.S. Discussing High-Level Meeting on Resettlement</HEAD>

   Vietnam and the United States are considering
a high-level meeting to discuss the resettlement of Vietnamese who
worked with Americans during the war and have been freed from
prison camps there, the State Department said Wednesday.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thatch sent a May 23 message through the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok, Thailand, asking for a meeting with U.S. presidential
envoy retired Army Gen. John Vessey.
   Vessey held talks with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi last year
on stepping up efforts to find some 2,500 Americans missing in
action from the Indochinese war.
   Contacts with Vietnam, which does not have diplomatic relations
with the United States, have been sporadic in recent years. The
United States has adopted a policy of isolating Vietnam
economically and diplomatically in order to pressure the Hanoi
government into ending its 10-year military occupation of Cambodia.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz sent a letter last month to
Thatch welcoming Vietnam's release of hundreds of prisoners from
so-called re-education camps in September 1987 and February 1988,
Redman said.
   But Shultz's letter also expressed ``our concern about the fate
of these prisoners because of their association with us and the
former Saigon government,'' Redman said.
   The former Vietnamese officials and loyalists were placed in
prison camps after Communist North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed
South Vietnam in 1975.
   Shultz asked Thatch to discuss resettlement of the released
prisoners in the United States, a move which ``reflects our
continuing concern for the welfare of our former allies,'' Redman
added.
   Slightly more than 1,000 political prisoners were freed in
February 1988, and Vietnamese officials have assured the United
States that fewer than 150 people remain in re-education camps,
said a State Department official.
   The official, who asked not to be named, said some 900,000
Vietnamese had undergone short-term or long-term ``re-education''
since 1975. He said only a handful of those who were released from
the camps have come to the United States.

<HEAD>Pentagon Report Says Job Cuts Possible Without Harming Readiness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal study ordered by Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci concludes the Pentagon could eliminate 7,300 jobs
from its headquarters around the world, or 12 percent of the total,
without jeopardizing military readiness.
   Such cuts would save more than $300 million a year in operating
cost and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost guarantees
America's military forces will have a hard time fighting any war,
the study asserts.
   The situation has gotten so out of hand the Pentagon doesn't
even properly count its headquarters' staff, it added.
   ``We have a situation where the department is reporting about
33,132 positions in Unified and Specified Commands and supporting
service component commands in budget justifications provided
Congress, while we identified 59,510 positions in these same
headquarters during the review,'' it said.
   ``The review disclosed significant areas of overlapping
responsibilities, duplication of functions, layering and
opportunities for saving manpower.''
   The study, requested by Carlucci last Dec. 14, was performed by
a 22-member panel chaired by Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the Defense
Department's deputy inspector general. The Associated Press
obtained a copy Wednesday.
   The inch-thick report has been closely held since its completion
in February, on the ground that Carlucci is still awaiting a review
of the findings by Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   That review is not expected to be completed before next month at
the earliest, but the study itself was provided to key
congressional leaders on Tuesday.
   Carlucci asked Vander Schaaf, whose office serves as an internal
watchdog, to review the organization of the Joint Chiefs and the
major military commands after the White House and Congress reached
a deficit-reduction agreement cutting defense spending. At the
time, Carlucci said he hoped to reduce overhead costs.
   ``Although probably no one will agree with all of the
recommendations contained in this report, I believe that
substantial savings can be made without jeopardizing military
readiness ...,'' Vander Schaaf wrote.
   ``In many cases, output will actually increase when layering and
staff sizes are reduced. I recommend the elimination of 7,309
military and civilian positions by the end of fiscal 1989.''
   The study panel spotlighted what it called overlapping or
superfluous headquarters units that amounted to military
bureaucracy run amok:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The U.S. Forces Caribbean Command in Key West, Fla., was
established ``as a response to reports of a Soviet brigade in
Cuba.''
   ``But in all the important contingencies imaginable, it appears
the command will either get in the way or be ignored. (The command)
is clearly not essential to either our peacetime or wartime needs.''
   _The division of responsibility for air and ground defenses in
Alaska ``is confusing (and) will probably not work in an emergency
....'' It said the situation has been complicated by the need to
obtain the political blessing of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, a top
member of the Senate defense appropriations subcommittee.
   _The Army has a separate Western Command in Hawaii, designated
as its representative to the U.S. Pacific Command. The Pentagon
``simply cannot afford the luxury of having 527 personnel in a
command to serve as the Army trainer for Hawaii and Guam and as an
`adviser' to the U.S. Pacific Command on Army matters.''
   _The Strategic Air Command maintains a system of Air Division
headquarters within the continental United States that is ``largely
superfluous'' and can only be categorized as ``nice to have, but
unnecessary.''
   The panel took special aim at the Space Command, the Special
Operations Command and the Transportation Command, saying it could
see no reason for each of the military services to have
headquarters units representing them within those commands.
   For example, the Transportation Command does not really need a
separate Military Airlift Command, Military Sealift Command and
Military Traffic Management Command underneath it, the study said.
If those units were disbanded, ``the estimated savings in
headquarters manpower over the next two years would be 1,015
positions.''
   An additional 286 positions could be slashed from the staff of
the Joint Chiefs, which now numbers 2,005, the study added.

<HEAD>Three Kentucky Incumbents Win Primaries; Idaho Voters Select
Challengers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three incumbent Democratic congressmen easily won primary
contests in Kentucky, while Idaho's two incumbent congressmen
prepared to face challengers selected in that state's primary.
   Rep. Carroll Hubbard, who represents Kentucky's 1st District,
won a lopsided victory Tuesday over Lacey T. Smith in what was
called the nastiest campaign in the country.
   ``This has been a long, expensive and arduous campaign and I'm
glad it's over,'' Hubbard said after receiving 73 percent of the
vote. Hubbard is all but assured of election victory since the only
Republican who filed for the nomination has withdrawn. One
little-known independent candidate will provide Hubbard's only
opposition.
   Hubbard buried Smith, 63,136 votes to 23,153 votes.
   The other two members of Kentucky's seven-member congressional
delegation who faced opposition also won handily.
   Rep. Romano Mazzoli, who has represented the 3rd District since
1970, rolled up 61 percent of the vote. Mazzoli received 31,288
votes to Jeffrey Hutter's 20,207.
   Mazzoli will face former assistant U.S. Attorney Philip Dunnagan
in the general election. Dunnagan won the GOP nomination against
three others on the ballot.
   Rep. William H. Natcher, who has held the 2nd Congressional
District seat since 1953, won 76 percent of the vote. Natcher
pulled 26,918 votes to 8,319 for Bob Evans.
   Natcher's opponent in November will be retired Army officer
Martin A. Tori who was unopposed for the Republican nomination.
   In Idaho, two-term Democratic state Rep. Jeanne Givens, 37, of
Coeur d'Alene, won a three-way primary Tuesday to face four-term
Republican Rep. Larry Craig in the state's 1st Congressional
District. Givens had 18,097 votes, or 63 percent.
   In Idaho's 2nd Congressional District, former state legislator
Dane Watkins, 44, of Idaho Falls defeated one other candidate for
the Republican nomination to oppose two-term Democratic Rep.
Richard Stallings. Watkins garnered 20,547 votes, or 59 percent.

<HEAD>Lottery Bill: You Can't Take it With You, So Get it Up Front</HEAD>

   Because you can't take it with you, the
state Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would allow lottery
winners over 65 to receive their winnings sooner than younger
people who hit the jackpot.
   Older lottery winners could take the current value of their
lottery prize in one lump sum or in periodic payments over their
expected lifetime.
   ``The usual 20-year payoff on a lottery prize will not always
result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65, as he may
not live to receive the full benefit,'' said a memo on the bill.
   ``The fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate
is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to
fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune,'' the memo said.
   But John Quinn, director of the Lottery Division, said he
opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots.
   The jackpot up Wednesday was $3 million.
   ``I don't have $3 million to give them, I have $1.4 million,''
he said. ``The difference is interest money.''
   Under the current plan, a winner would receive 21 annual
payments of $114,000 after taxes, said Quinn. If someone opted to
take the prize in a $1.4 million lump sum, they would owe about
$580,000 in taxes, he said.
   Quinn said he didn't believe any state lotteries now offer the
lump-sum option.
   The average million-dollar lottery winner is 49 years old, said
Quinn.
   Quinn said he had not informed the state Legislature of his
opposition to the bill, now before the Assembly Ways and Means
Committee.

<HEAD>House Votes to Lift Curb on Interstate Ads for Gambling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday to remove a federal
prohibition on interstate advertising of gambling.
   Under current law, advertising of games of chance are prohibited
in interstate commerce except for state-conducted lotteries between
adjacent states that also have lotteries.
   The bill, approved by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would
allow advertising across state lines of gambling activities, such
as casino gambling and church raffles and bingo, conducted by
public or private groups so long as they are legal in the state
where they are held.
   The legislation would still allow individual states to restrict
such advertising.

<HEAD>Commercial Banks Recovering From Worst Year Since Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's commercial banks appear to be
recovering from their worst year since the Depression despite
mounting bank failures in the Southwest and continuing problems
with loans to Third World countries, federal regulators said
Wednesday.
   ``The banking system as a whole is sound and getting sounder ...
The outlook for the immediate future is cautiously optimistic,''
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman told
the Senate Banking Committee.
   The performance of farm banks, the sore spot of the industry
several years ago, is slowly improving as agriculture recovers from
its slump, he said.
   The nation's largest banks, bedeviled by shaky loans to less
developed countries, wrote off big losses last year and now have
``adequate, if not comfortable, reserves,'' he said.
   And there are signs that the economy of the Southwest, heavily
dependent on the oil industry, has hit bottom and turned up.
   Still, he warned, bank failures in Texas could rise from 50 last
year to 70 this year because banks' performance generally lags
economic changes.
   ``We believe 1989 looks better (in Texas) for two reasons: Every
major bank will have its problems resolved in one way or another.
.... And smaller banks are already showing some recovery in the
first quarter'' of 1988, he said.
   Last year, by almost any measure, was the worst for the nation's
13,650 commercial banks since 1933. A record 184 banks failed _
Seidman expects about the same number this year _ and banking as a
whole posted its lowest profit level in 54 years, a 2.02 percent
return on equity.
   But, the entire drop can be attributed to the $20.6 billion in
write-offs for overseas loans, a move the regulators said has
strengthened banks' ability to deal with the problem.
   ``There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of the
currency, Robert L. Clarke, whose office regulates nationally
chartered banks. ``But they should not overshadow the fact that the
national banking system remains sound.''
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., agreed that ``the picture this
year is by no means gloomy,'' but he raised concerns about the
possibility that developing country loans will have to be written
down still further.
   Banks have written off the loans by about 25 percent to 30
percent, but they trade on the open market at only about 50 cents
on the dollar, he said.
   Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller said
``meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debt
problem. Because much of the value of the loans depends on the
countries' willingness, rather than their ability, to pay,
judgments vary as to how much they should be written down.
   Proxmire, the chairman of the committee, also questioned the
ability of banks to withstand a severe recession.
   ``What haunts me is that Texas today might be the United States
tomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said.
   Seidman, whose agency insures bank deposits up to $100,000, said
many banks are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill
effects.
   He added, ``The FDIC fund is adequate to deal with any problems
we can foresee in the banking system in 1988.''
   Compared with the fund that insures savings institutions, the
FDIC is in good shape, ending 1987 with $18.3 billion, up slightly
from the end of 1986. But, the fund could record its first loss,
depending on how much it costs to restore First Republicbank Corp.
of Dallas to health.
   At least one thrift industry trade group, the National Council
of Savings Institutions, is eyeing the FDIC as a potential source
of money to rescue the S&L insurance fund, which most analysts say
will not have enough money to meet the $20 billion to $60 billion
pricetag of cleaning up insolvent savings institutions.
   Seidman vigorously opposed that idea, arguing that the money
should come from the thrift industry and as a last resort, the
taxpayer.

<HEAD>Auto Dealers Give AIDS Victim Ryan White New Set Of Wheels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A beaming Ryan White climbed behind the
wheel of his very own car Wednesday and said he planned to drive
``anywhere and everywhere'' _ just as soon as he gets a driver's
license.
   The 16-year-old AIDS victim received the black 1987 Chevrolet
Cavalier from the Indiana Independent Automobile Dealers
Association during brief ceremonies at the Auto Dealer's Exchange,
an auto auction house.
   ``Ryan has shown that the ordinary things in life can be
ennobling. He has the kind of courage that I think most of us would
like to have,'' Fritz Kreutzinger, president of the association,
said before handing Ryan the keys.
   ``I just want to tell everybody thanks, and I really appreciate
it,'' Ryan said.
   When asked what he planned to do with the car, White said,
``Drive it. I'm going to go anywhere and everywhere.''
   Ryan has completed driver's education classes and plans to get
his license June 9.
   ``Somebody came up with the idea for Ryan because we saw on TV
that he was going to get his driver's license,'' said Kreutzinger,
of Fishers. ``The heart of this is just a bunch of guys willing to
kick in and do something.''
   Kreutzinger said individuals had donated the sunroof and stereo
for the car, which has 25,000 miles on it. Ryan's mother, Jeanne
White, said the car met all her son's requirements: black with
tinted windows and bucket seats.
   Ryan was diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome
in December 1984. He contracted the AIDS virus through blood
products used in the treatment of his hemophilia.
   In the summer of 1985, officials at Western School Corp. near
Kokomo banned him from classes at Western Middle School. Although
he won a long legal battle to stay in school, Mrs. White moved her
family early last year to Cicero, 25 miles north of Indianapolis.
Her son enrolled in Hamilton Heights High School, where
administrators and classmates welcomed him.
   The Whites were expected to travel to New York on Thursday for a
UNICEF benefit with Nancy Reagan.

   The Federal Election Commission distributed
$1.7 million in federal matching funds to presidential candidates
Wednesday, bringing to $56.2 million the total the government has
given out in the primary campaign this year.
   Four candidates were certified for money on Wednesday:
Republican Vice President George Bush, $289,792; Democrats Michael
Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, $369,442, and Jesse Jackson,
$967,942, and independent Lenora Fulani, $42,289.
   The candidate who has received the most matching funds overall,
Republican Pat Robertson, has suspended his campaign and received
no money on Wednesday.
   He has received $8.6 million, compared to Bush's $8.3 million.
   Dukakis has received $7.7 million in all, and Jackson $4.2
million. Fulani has received less than $500,000.
   To be eligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise an
initial $100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $250 or less.
Thereafter the FEC matches each contribution of $250 that
candidates raise privately.
   The matching fund is supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff on
individual income tax returns.

<HEAD>Acreage Idling Requirement to be Cut in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers will be required to idle only 10
percent of their base acreage for the 1989 harvest, compared with
27.5 percent for 1988, the Agriculture Department announced
Wednesday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers also said the government's price
support loan rate for 1989 will be reduced to $2.06 per bushel from
$2.21 this year. The 1989 target price will be $4.10 per bushel,
down from $4.23 for the 1988 wheat crop.
   Farmers who wish to qualify for price supports and other program
benefits are required to go along with acreage set-aside, or
idling, requirements.
   The loan rate is how much a farmer can borrow from the USDA by
using the crop as collateral. If market prices are significantly
higher later on, the producer usually repays the loan and sells or
uses the commodity at will. If market prices are lower than the
loan rate, the producer has the option of forefeiting the grain to
USDA, thereby canceling the debt.
   Target prices are used to compute federal direct payments to
producers. When market prices are below the target, ``deficiency''
payments are made to make up the difference between the basic loan
rate or the average market price, whichever his higher.
   Myers said the reduction in the loan rate was necessary to
maintain U.S. wheat's competitiveness in domestic and international
markets.
   The reduction in the set-aside for 1989 reflects a draw-down in
U.S. wheat stockpiles and a decision to rebuild those inventories
in order to meet future export demand.

   Ivana Trump, wife of billionaire developer
Donald Trump, became a U.S. citizen Wednesday at federal court,
where she and other new citizens were told that America was
``vastly enriched'' by their presence.
   Mrs. Trump, 38, a former fashion model and current president of
the Plaza Hotel and Trump's Castle Hotel & Casino, stood with 141
other naturalized citizens.
   The presiding judge, Charles S. Haight Jr., welcomed them to the
``freedom to follow your dreams'' adding: ``by your presence,
America is vastly enriched.''
   Mrs. Trump, whose salary is $1 a year and all the dresses she
can buy, wore an off-white suit, cut above the knee, with a
blue-and-white striped blouse.
   She kissed her husband on the cheek and was embraced and kissed
by her friend, Jackie Miner, wife of U.S. Circuit Court Judge Roger
Miner.
   Miner, who sat next to Haight on the bench, gave a 10-minute
speech on the duties of new citizens. He did not mention Mrs. Trump
by name, but referred to ``a special friend'' who was being
naturalized.
   ``I'm very proud of my wife,'' a beaming Trump said outside the
courthouse. ``I'm very proud of my country. It's a great country
and that's where a great woman should be. Now they're both matched
up perfectly.''
   Mrs. Trump, an Austrian-born, former Czechoslovakian national,
came to this country 10 years ago after working as a model in
Montreal. She said she, too, was ``very proud.''
   After the crowd cleared out, the Trumps chatted in the courtroom
with the two judges before leaving with the Miners in a limousine.

genetically engineered pesticide that doesn't alter the genetics of
the pest or the plant being protected.
   Diane O'Connor, a spokeswoman, said she was told that the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service signed the
permit for the Crop Genetics International Inc. of Hanover, Md.,
aimed at protecting corn from the European corn borer through a
process akin to inoculation.
   The Environmental Protection Agency gave its approval on Tuesday
for the test. Crop Genetics plans to take a harmless bacterium
found in Bermuda grass and use it to carry a gene from another
bacterium, called Cxc-Bt, that will then produce a toxin lethal to
corn borers.
   The toxin would only be activated inside the alkaline stomach of
the borer, a kind of caterpillar, after it eats the treated plant
tissue.
   The acid stomachs of humans, birds, animals and fish simply
digest the protein.
   Cxc-Bt ``will have limited persistence in the environment and is
not likely to be harmful to humans or other non-target organisms,''
EPA said.
   The effect on other organisms is not of concern, EPA said,
because the parent Cxc strain is native to Maryland, the
toxin-producing gene will be naturally eliminated from the Cxc and
stringent containment procedures will be followed.
   The firm plans to inoculate 6,300 corn plants on 1.37 acres at
its research farm at Ingleside, Md., and 3,500 plants on 0.78 acre
at the Agriculture Department's Research Center in Beltsville just
outside Washington.
   The test will last through this fall.

<HEAD>Journalists Win Battle To Get Edwin Wilson Deposition In Contra
Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent will be allowed to
testify in a $24 million civil suit that accuses former CIA
officials, Contra leaders and cocaine traffickers of running a
guns-for-drugs smuggling scheme.
   U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King agreed Wednesday to take
a formal deposition from Edwin Wilson in the civil suit filed by
two journalists. Wilson is in prison on convictions for selling
explosives and plotting to kill the federal prosecutor in his case.
   According to the plaintiffs' lawyer, Daniel Sheehan, Wilson has
testified that one of the defendants, former CIA deputy director of
operations Theodore Shackley, helped set up a secret, illegal
intelligence operation.
   The lawsuit, filed by journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey,
maintains that Shackley, Iran-Contra figures Albert Hakim and
Richard Secord and others, set up the operation to assassinate
terrorists and enemies of U.S. allies, and ship weapons to the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   ``Wilson shows this is the off-the-shelf operation set up by
Shackley, Secord and Hakim, just as we have been saying,'' said
Sheehan.
   The suit stems from a 1984 bombing of a news conference held by
maverick Contra commander Eden Pastora in La Penca, Nicaragua.
   Three journalists and five Pastora supporters died in the
explosion, although Pastora was only slightly injured.
   Avirgan was seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the
explosion. Under federal law, he and his wife, Ms. Honey, have the
right to file suit for damages.
   Wednesday's hearing was held to consider a motion by Shackley,
who left the CIA in 1979, to drop him as a defendant in the
lawsuit. King said he would not rule immediately.
   Shackley's attorney, Jack McKay, argued that, two years after
filing suit, the plaintiffs have yet to come up with any credible
evidence connecting Shackley to any conspiracy that led to the
bombing.
   But Sheehan countered with a sworn statement by Wilson, saying
that Wilson, Shackley, Secord and others had met in 1976 and 1977
to set up the private intelligence operation to prevent it from
being ended by the incoming Carter administration.
   The lawsuit contends the Contra gun-running operation was simply
one of the latest in a series of activities by the secret team,
including the assassinations of enemies of the Shah of Iran and
military aid to Somoza, both before and after his 1979 overthrow by
the Sandinistas.
   After the hearing, Sheehan hailed King's decision to allow
Wilson's deposition to be taken as a victory for the plaintiffs.
They have argued that events of a decade ago _ when they claimed
the operation was set up _ should be examined in the case. Prior to
Wednesday's decision, King had only allowed depositions covering
back to 1983.
   McKay said the decision was not a setback, but added, ``It is
going to complicate the case.''
   Both sides agree the June 27 trial date will be more difficult
to meet.
   Besides Shackley, Secord and Hakim, other defendants in the suit
include Contra director Adolfo Calero; Medellin Cartel leaders
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez; and retired Maj.
Gen. John K. Singlaub.
   The suit was filed in May 1986, six months before the
Iran-Contra affair became public, and many of the names it brought
to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional
committees investigating that case.
   All the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the
charges in the case.
   In a May 6 hearing in Miami, Sheehan accused members of the
Reagan administration of attempting to block the suit because of
potential damage to Vice President George Bush, who led the CIA in
1976.

<HEAD>Estate Of Young `Poltergeist' Actress Files Wrongful Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wrongful death suit was filed Wednesday
against a hospital and an insurance group by the estate of Heather
O'Rourke, the actress sucked into a swirling supernatural vacuum in
the ``Poltergeist'' movies.
   Heather died Feb. 1 on the operating table at Children's
Hospital of San Diego. She was 12.
   She died of septic shock due to congenital stenosis of the
intestine, a bowel blockage the girl evidently had from birth,
hospital officials said at the time.
   The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court against Kaiser
Foundation Hospital of San Diego and Southern California Permanente
Medical Group on behalf of Kathleen O'Rourke Peel, Heather's mother
and administrator of her estate, does not specify damages.
   ``We want to be free to establish damages,'' said Sanford M.
Gage, the O'Rourke family's attorney.
   Children's Hospital spokeswoman Terry Merryman said she could
not comment on the suit.
   Kaiser Permanente spokesman Jim McBride said: ``About all we can
say is that we have reviewed the case extensively and we are
convinced that the care we provided was appropriate. But we can't
discuss the specifics any further.''
   The lawsuit contends the hospital's diagnosis led to Heather's
death.
   ``The doctors failed to recognize that she had a bowel
obstruction since birth and misdiagnosed her condition. As a
result, they prescribed medication instead of a relatively simple
operation that would have cured her,'' Gage said.
   In addition to her ``Poltergeist'' roles, Heather was a regular
on television's ``Happy Days,'' a recurring character on
``Webster'' and ``Still the Beaver'' and one of the stars in an ABC
miniseries on teen-age suicide called ``Surviving.''

accomplishments exemplify the academy motto, ``Duty, Honor,
Country.''

   The chief opponent of the medium-range arms
control treaty conceded defeat Wednesday, clearing the way for
possible Senate approval of the historic accord before President
Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow this
weekend.
   ``I'm fairly confident we will be able to finish the treaty
Friday or Saturday,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., said.
   That would mean the treaty could be approved in time to fly the
ratification notice to Moscow so the president could present it to
Gorbachev during the May 29-June 2 summit, Byrd noted.
   Reagan left Washington on Wednesday for the summit, with a
three-day stopover in Helsinki, Finland, en route.
   Ratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact
requires 67 votes and is assured because 90 or more senators
support the treaty, according to supporters and critics of the pact.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the treaty's chief critic, conceded he
had failed in his attempt to modify the accord, which Reagan and
Gorbachev signed Dec. 8 in Washington.
   ``I'm licked in terms of doing anything on the treaty,'' Helms
told reporters.
   Later, Helms admitted, ``I've had no illusions from the very
beginning about the prospects of defeating this treaty.''
   The treaty requires elimination within three years of all U.S.
and Soviet nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400
miles. It would result in the elimination of 867 U.S. missiles in
Europe and elimination of 1,752 Soviet missiles.
   Helms, Byrd and other Senate leaders met behind closed doors to
work out an agreement that would end the procedural snarl which has
blocked definitive action on the pact since it reached the floor
last week.
   Helms and other critics, using Senate rules designed to protect
the rights of the minority, have stalled action, filing a series of
amendments that were rejected overwhelmingly.
   In response, Byrd and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
filed a cloture motion to halt debate. That motion is set for a
vote Thursday. Approval of the motion requires 60 votes and is
assured, meaning the debate would be limited to 30 hours. That
would set up a final vote Friday.
   The back-stage talks were aimed at setting aside the cloture
vote, which also would mean the Senate could avoid the all-night
session which would be required if cloture were invoked.
   Helms said that after the cloture motion was filed, he realized
``the ball game was over.'' But he said he still was seeking
approval of some amendments which could be attached as conditions
to the resolution of ratification.
   But there was no agreement by late Wednesday afternoon, meaning
the cloture vote was likely to go ahead Thursday morning.
   Meantime, the chamber voted 89-9 to reject a Helms amendment
which would have abrogated the treaty if the United States found
that the Soviets had furnished false information. It was the 10th
time the Senate had voted overwhelming rejection of amendments
offered by GOP conservatives.
   ``The Soviets have cheated (on other treaties), they are
cheating now, and they will continue to cheat,'' said Helms.
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the proposal would be a
``killer amendment'' that would require the pact to be renegotiated
with the Soviets.
   Dole said the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting, ``as do all summits,
offers the promise of progress ... and the peril of inflated
expectations.''
   He urged the Senate to ``do our part'' and approve the INF pact,
which he noted is ``the first ever to reduce existing nuclear
stockpiles and eliminate whole classes of nuclear weapons.''
   One unresolved issue in the Senate was the fate of a
Democratic-backed proposal which would require Senate approval
before any future president could change how the treaty is
interpreted.
   That amendment, added by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
arises from a long-running fight over a separate issue involving
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Reagan asserts that the White House can unilaterally change the
interpretation of a treaty, a view disputed by congressional
Democrats.
   Many Senate Republicans oppose that amendment, Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., noted Wednesday.
   ``This issue of treaty interpretation is one that will have
far-reaching consequences,'' Specter told his colleagues.
   Byrd said Democrats still haven't decided the specific language
of that amendment.

<HEAD>NYSE Chief Ties Investor Uncertainty to Future Doubts, Not October
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange
said Wednesday that continuing market skittishness is due to
uncertainty over the future of the economy, not to lingering
aftershocks of the October market crash.
   ``I think the markets are really looking toward the future ...
and cannot make up their minds about it,'' John J. Phelan Jr. said.
``I think when they make up their minds, confidence will return.''
   Phelan, in a luncheon speech to Congressional Clearinghouse on
the Future, acknowledged that small investors have pulled out of
the market since the plunge of last October, but said, ``I think
they are behaving very prudently now, which is, in times of
uncertainty, do nothing.''
   Phelan said his own view of the economy's prospects was
somewhere between that of the pessismists who have predicted a
1930s style depression and optimists who assert the economy is
headed for a ``rolling correction,'' entailing little more than
somewhat higher interest rates and slower growth.
   ``Unless you believe in the tooth fairy, you don't believe the
business cycle has gone away,'' he said. ``There are the beginnings
of certain classic signs of the end of an economic expansion. ...
Unless something is very strange, the next 18 months to two years
are not going to be easy.''
   But looking toward the 1990s and beyond, Phelan said the future
looks bright.
   ``I'm 57 years old and the bears have always lost,'' he said.
   The clearinghouse is a bipartisan caucus of senators and
representatives concerned with long-range trends and issues of the
future.

   A Virginia congressman introduced legislation
Wednesday he said would speed congressional efforts to protect the
Manassas National Battlefield from encroaching commercial
development.
   The bill by Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., calls for immediate
government acquisition of the approximately 600 acres adjacent to
the park where a developer plans to build a shopping mall.
   It also directs the interior secretary to make sure the scenery
around the park is protected, calls for closing two roads that
bisect the Civil War site and proposes a bypass to carry traffic
around the area.
   A bill already has been introduced for government purchase of
the land now owned by Hazel-Peterson Co. developers, but it directs
acquisition through the Interior Department, a slower process than
the ``legislative taking'' of the land recommended by Wolf.
   The earlier legislation was introduced by Reps. Robert Mrazek,
D-N.Y., and Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and by Wednesday had 166
co-sponsors.
   Tad Boggs, Mrazek's press secretary, said the congressman ``is
wholeheartedly endorsing the (Wolf) bill.''
   ``He hopes that it can be melded together with his bill, but it
accomplishes everything he hopes to see done,'' Boggs said.
   ``I think everyone should be pleased that a Virginian has
finally said no to the shopping mall,'' Andrews said.
   Stan Parris, another Virginia congressman whose district is near
the battlefield just outside Washington, said he will co-sponsor
Wolf's bill.
   Rep. D. French Slaughter Jr., whose district includes the park,
is studying the bill, according to his administrative assistant,
George White.
   Ian Spatz, spokesman for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, which also has been fighting the developer, said his
organization was encouraged to have Wolf's support.
   ``We want to study it further, but it looks like something we
could support,'' said Spatz. ``(Wolf's plan) provides more
certainty that the property owner would get paid for the property.''
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel had proposed that the developer
move the shopping mall so it would not be visible from the park. He
also said the roads bisecting the park should be closed.
   Though preservationists like the idea of closing the roads, they
say the mall should not be anywhere near the park because of
traffic problems it would create.

   Here are capsule summaries of the financial
disclosure forms filed by members of the House from Nevada for 1987
and released Wednesday.
   Income includes the House salary, honoraria earnings from
writing and speeches and other income such as dividends and
interest.
   Earnings by the representatives' spouses and dependents are not
included in the income figure.
   The asset and liability figures for the representatives do not
include holdings and liabilities of spouses and dependents.
   Representatives are permitted to keep honoraria earnings from
speeches and writings up to 30 percent of their salary. For nearly
all members, their salary was $89,500 at the end of 1987. The
speaker of the House was paid at the annualized rate of $115,000
and the Democratic and Republican leaders were paid at the
annualized rate of $99,500.
   Many members receive honoraria above the limit and donate the
excess to charity.
   In their financial disclosure forms, representatives are allowed
to list income, assets and liabilities by ranges instead of
specific figures. However, some representatives provide specific
figures.
   In their listing of assets, representatives do not have to
include their personal residences and vehicles. Gifts, though
listed, are not counted in income figure given here.

<HEAD>Government Directed To Require More Smokeless Tobacco Warnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has directed the government to
require that warnings about the health hazards of smokeless tobacco
be printed on umbrellas, towels and other items used to promote the
products.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the
Smokeless Tobacco Act is ``clear and unequivocal'' in its
requirement that all advertising for smokeless tobacco _ except
billboards _ carry warnings the products may cause mouth cancer,
gum disease or tooth loss.
   Jackson ordered the Federal Trade Commission to revise
regulations that had also exempted promotional items such as
T-shirts, promotional banners, coffee mugs and caps, from the
requirement.
   The judge stayed his order, however, to give the FTC an
opportunity to appeal the decision.
   Jackson ruled that the exemption given by the FTC to promotional
items undercut the clear intent of Congress in passing the law.
   ``If vendors of smokeless tobacco products are able to put their
wares before prospective consumers, bare of warning labels on
T-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, beverage coolers, and the like, as a
practical matter they may effectively frustrate the purpose of the
warning label requirements by doing most of their advertising with
`utilitarian' giveaways,'' Jackson said in an opinion dated May 20
but made public Wednesday.
   Jackson made the ruling in a lawsuit brought last year by the
American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the
American Lung Association and the Public Health Association.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a political
coalition allied with leftist guerrillas said Wednesday the
government's refusal to resume negotiations on ending the
8-year-old war threatens a deeper crisis.
   ``This is a moment of life and death for the Salvadorans, for
the national economy and the social structure,'' Guillermo Manuel
Ungo said. He arrived Wednesday on only his second visit to El
Salvador since going into exile soon after the war began.
   Ungo, president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, said he
would stay for about a week. He also returned for a week last
November.
   His coalition is allied with the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, the guerrilla alliance fighting the
U.S.-supported government.
   He criticized the rejection Tuesday of a May 11 rebel proposal
for renewed negotiations. President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
government said it was not an opportune moment for talks.
   In view of the nation's problems, Ungo declared, ``an opportune
moment comes every day.''
   A dispute over the results of March 20 elections left Duarte
without a legislature. The National Assembly has yet to be seated.
   Peace talks with the rebels broke down in October.
   The main purpose of Ungo's visit is to promote his political
party, the National Revolutionary Movement, and a coalition called
Democratic Convergence.
   Ungo's party formed the coalition last year with another member
party of the Democratic Revolutionary Front and the Social
Democrats, an officially recognized leftist party.
   He said the Democratic Convergence might run a candidate in next
year's presidential election.
   ``We don't rule out participation,'' he said. ``We will see what
role our growing presence and influence might play.''
   The guerrillas and their allies have boycotted elections in the
past.

<HEAD>With AM-Reagan-Summit, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass adopted an upbeat pre-summit tone Wednesday,
quoting President Reagan as saying he was coming to the Soviet
Union in the interests of peace.
   The evening television news program Vremya carried a report from
a Washington correspondent on Reagan's visit and later showed
Reagan leaving for Helsinki, Finland, en route to Moscow.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, quoted Reagan's departure
statement that he intended to work in the interests of peace during
his visit to the Soviet capital next week.
   It quoted Reagan as saying measures to reduce tension between
the superpowers, capped by the signing of the agreement banning
medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles at the last summit in
Washington last December, were ``only a beginning.''
   The agency said Reagan pledged to work for an agreement to cut
U.S. and Soviet long-range missiles during his meetings with
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.
   It relegated Reagan's comments on the deep differences that
still divide the Soviet Union and the United States to the final
paragraph of its dispatch.
   A pair of later articles distributed by Tass were more critical.
   One was a commentary by military analyst Vladimir Bogachev. He
said the Reagan administration had backtracked on a pledge at the
Washington summit to observe the anti-ballistic missile treaty as
signed in 1972, rather than using Reagan's broad interpretation
that would allow more free development of the ``Star Wars'' program
for a space-based nuclear defense.
   ``Isn't it time that Washington began showing a more responsible
attitude to its commitments?'' Bogachev asked.
   In a separate story, Tass said a group of Soviet scientists
appealed to Reagan for more flexibility in allowing Soviets to
travel to the United States. It cited the cases of several
scientists who it said were denied visas.
   Tass quoted Viktor Karpov in another report as saying that
Reagan and Gorbachev could exchange in Moscow instruments of
ratification of the December agreement if the U.S. Senate ratifies
the treaty soon.
   Karpov, head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department,
said Monday that the Soviet Union should not ratify the treaty
before the United States does.
   Senate majority leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday
that the Senate should be prepared to take final action on the
treaty Friday or Saturday.
   ``There are no doubts that the Soviet Union will not delay that
historic act by taking too long to ratify the INF (intermediate
nuclear forces) treaty,'' Karpov said.
   The treaty must be approved by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the country's top executive body.

<HEAD>Computer Whiz Kid Hospitalized With Mother After Business Assets
Seized</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old computer wunderkind was in
serious condition along with his mother Wednesday after what may
have been a double suicide attempt following the seizure of his
company, police said.
   Tex Zachary Hildreth fled the Braintree, Mass., area just before
his 5-year-old computer services company, Massdata Corp., was
closed by authorities and its assets seized Tuesday. Hildreth left
behind about 30 angry employees and investors.
   He was arrested as a fugitive from justice in Manchester on
Tuesday after an employee at the Holiday Inn called police to
report a bloodied man wandering in the lobby. Police said that when
they arrived just after 2 p.m., they found Hildreth's mother, Rose
Hildreth, 50, lying injured in the hotel room the two shared.
   Police Lt. William Bovaird said both Hildreths were taken to
Elliot Hospital, where, according to hospital spokeswoman Ann
Williams, they were listed in serious condition Wednesday.
   Bovaird said both Hildreths were ``incoherent'' when police
arrived at the hotel. He gave only sketchy details about their
injuries but said it appeared that Hildreth may have slashed his
wrists. He said a bottle of non-prescription pills were found in
the hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes.
   Bovaird declined to elaborate, saying the case was still under
investigation.
   On Monday, Rockland Trust Co., owed more than $400,000, tried to
seize the company's assets, but the office was closed at the time,
according to senior vice president John O'Connor. County
authorities and state police secured the company offices Tuesday
night.
   Mike McGorty, a spokesman for the Norfolk County district
attorney's office in Massachusetts, said Wednesday that his office
began to investigate Hildreth Tuesday after receiving complaints
about him from several people who said they did business with him.
   McGorty said Weymouth police had charged Hildreth with larceny
over $250 Tuesday after receiving a complaint from another person.
McGorty said the investigation into Hildreth's business dealings
was expected to be ``lengthy.''
   Hildreth's sudden fall came after a meteoric rags to riches
tale. Hildreth was an overweight, unhappy teen-ager who transformed
himself into a computer whiz and budding millionaire just a few
years out of high school.
   Hildreth's company turned profitable in 1987 and expected sales
of about $4 million this year, the Boston Globe reported in April.
   As recently as last month, Hildreth was profiled in an article
that began with a description of him stepping out of a limousine
with a beautiful woman to attend the fifth reunion of his Braintree
High School class in November.
   ``This was my revenge for four years of hell,'' Hildreth said at
the time.
   After buying his first computer at age 16, Hildreth began
writing software programs. The confidence he gained as a computer
whiz prompted him to lose 115 pounds in less than two years.
   With the help of a mentor in the Braintree area, Hildreth rented
office space at the age of 20 and went into business as a computer
consultant. He gradually built up the business, hiring young
computer experts from other companies.
   He began to rapidly acquire the signs of success: a $220,000
Weymouth condominium, a $32,000 BMW and a 50-inch, $4,000 color TV.
His mother, who once worked as a lunch matron at her son's school,
was made clerk of the company.
   Last week, employees became suspicious when the president of
Massdata told them their paychecks were being withheld because
Hildreth had not signed them. Hildreth had collapsed in his office
two days earlier, suffering from what was described as an aneurysm,
a dangerous weakening of a blood vessel.

<TEXT>
   George Bush said Wednesday that a
``liberal elite'' is jeopardizing U.S. security by opposing every
new weapons system that would preserve a strong defense.
   He also expressed optimism that Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega
could be induced to step aside, despite Secretary of State George
Shultz' announcement that negotiations aimed at achieving that had
failed, and no new talks were set.
   ``I'm convinced Noriega will be out of power,'' Bush told
reporters in Lakehurst, N.J.
   Speaking at a commencement ceremony at the U.S. Military
Academy, the vice president said of unnamed liberals, ``They are so
blinded by ideology that they cannot see what Americans have
understood for 40 years: that peace flows from strength.''
   The Republican presidential nominee-to-be did not say who he was
referring to, apparently in deference to a federal ban on political
activity on military installations. But it was clear he was talking
about Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
   ``I'm sure they'd claim it isn't so and they're all in favor of
a strong defense,'' Bush said. ``They look the part, sober and
measured in their gray suits, moving their hands on the Sunday talk
shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness.''
   ``But what are we to think, when they say they're for a strong
defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would
preserve that strength?'' Bush asked.
   Asked about Noriega, Bush told reporters in New Jersey, ``The
fact that we haven't solved this doesn't depress me.''
   ``I don't want a bad deal. I want a good deal,'' he said.
``We'll have to go back and figure it out.''
   Bush's aides said last week that the vice president had urged
that talks with Noriega be suspended. However, Bush said while he
and President Reagan had some differences on the matter, they both
had the same ``policy objective of getting Noriega out.''
   The vice president again denied that he had known of Noriega's
alleged drug-dealing before the Panamanian leader was indicted on
U.S. drug charges. He said he thought Noriega should be extradited
to the U.S. to face the chargs, but acknowledged that would be
``difficult'' in light of the lack of a U.S. extradition treaty
with Panama.
   At West Point, Bush delivered the speech under a small canopy on
the field of the academy's football stadium in a driving rainstorm,
then stayed to shake hands with each of the 939 graduating cadets
and watched as they hurled their caps aloft.
   Bush, who in the past has criticized both Dukakis and Jackson by
name for a lack of foreign policy experience, noted that Reagan
left Wednesday morning for the upcoming superpower summit in Moscow.
   Praising the ``five years of patient effort'' toward a nuclear
arms limitation treaty, Bush said the summit was no reason for
complacency toward the Soviets.
   ``We must be confident that those who will lead our country
understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our
commitments,'' Bush said. ``We must be confident that they will
pursue negotiations with the Soviets realistically.''
   Bush aides had billed the speech as non-partisan. And the vice
president did praise former Democratic presidents Harry S. Truman
and John F. Kennedy.
   They, along with Republican president Dwight Eisenhower, were
part of a bipartisan consensus on dealing firmly with the Soviets
that Bush said lasted from the 1940s to the mid-1960s.
   ``There are some today who have abandoned those principles,'' he
said. ``The liberal elite do not understand _ they never understood
_ the common sense behind the consensus.''
   Later, addressing a group of senior citizens at a retirement
village in Lakehurst, N.J., Bush continued on the same defense
theme and said ``we've got to keep our eyes wide open'' while
negotiating with the Soviets.
   ``I am not naive aboutt Soviet intentions. We are on the right
track. We should not be afraid to talk. We should never talk from a
position of weakness,'' he said.
   Bush's campaign, meanwhile, acknowledged that chief spokesman
Peter Teeley was shifting to other duties.
   ``He's going to make a job switch,'' said campaign manager Lee
Atwater. He said Teeley would be ``a more creative type guy and
work specifically on the surrogate teams.''
   No reason was given for the change, but Teeley and Bush chief of
staff Craig Fuller were known to be at odds.
   On Thursday, after campaigning in the Newark area, Bush will fly
to his oceanside vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he
will spend the next week in a series of strategy and issues
sessions while Reagan is in Moscow.

   Two jetliners carrying a total of 286 people
were assigned the same altitude and missed colliding head-on by 300
feet over the ocean north of Puerto Rico last Monday, officials
disclosed Wednesday.
   According to the officials, the pilots of the southbound Pan
American World Airways A-300 and the northbound American Airlines
Boeing 727 did not see each other until the planes were passing at
better than 500 miles an hour.
   Neither pilot had time to take evasive action, spokesmen for the
two airlines said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar confirmed
that both jetliners were assigned to 29,000 feet and were under the
control of the San Juan air traffic control center at the time of
the incident. That section of airspace is beyond FAA radar, so
separation is maintained by assigning specific altitudes.
   The incident ``is being investigated as a possible operational
error'' by air traffic controllers, Farrar said. He said he did not
know whether the controllers involved have been removed from
directing aircraft, normally the procedure after such an incident.
   The Pan Am plane was Flight 217 from New York to Caracas,
Venezuela and on to Trinidad and carried 131 passengers and 10
crewmembers. The northbound plane was American Flight 902 from San
Juan to Philadelphia with 138 passengers and seven crewmembers
aboard.
   The section of airspace about 550 miles north of Puerto Rico in
the so-called Bermuda Triangle is beyond FAA radar at both San Juan
and on the U.S. mainland.
   Commercial jets operate under oceanic flight rules and are still
under radio air traffic direction. They are assigned specific
altitudes to maintain proper separation.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the Pan Am pilot filed a
near-collision report with the FAA. The American jet's pilots also
filed a report, according to American spokesman John Hotard.
   Farrar said the FAA still was investigating who gave the planes
their altitude assignments.
   A source who asked not to be identified by name said the
incident occurred near where control of planes switches from the
FAA center in New York to the San Juan center and the handoff may
have resulted in an altitude mixup.
   Farrar said he could not confirm that.
   Farrar said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal
separation as they passed. ``Both aircraft observed each other as
they passed,'' he said.
   Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board flew
to San Juan on Wednesday to interview the controllers involved,
said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   ``We are investigating the incident. We're looking into it,''
Lopatkiewicz said. He said the investigators may later interview
the pilots.

<HEAD>Philippine Senate Approves Anti-Nuclear Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators approved on second reading
Wednesday a bill that bans nuclear weapons on Philippine territory
but allows port calls by nuclear-powered ships.
   Orlando Mercado, majority floor leader, said the Senate is
expected to pass the bill next week on third reading, a formality
where the legislators register their votes.
   The bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in
the country, but was amended to allow nuclear-powered vessels to
make port calls after they are inspected by Philippine authorities.
   The chief sponsor of the measure, Sen. Wigberto Tanada, is an
anti-nuclear activisit and opposes U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Most senators hailed passage of the bill and said it would give
President Corazon Aquino's administration a stronger hand in
negotiating with U.S. officials on the future of Clark Air Base,
Subic Naval Base and four smaller U.S. military facilities here.
   Sen. Mamintal Tamano, who earlier expressed concern about the
bill's implications, said, ``This is a backdoor way of repudiating
the existing treaty between the U.S. and the Philippines and the
termination of the bases agreement.
   ``The Americans will be very uncomfortable with such a law,
which will render the bases ineffective.''
   Anti-nuclear activists have accused the Americans of using the
bases as storage or transit points for nuclear weapons. U.S.
authorities have refused to say yes or no.
   U.S. policy also is to remain silent on whether a Navy vessel is
carrying nuclear weapons.
   On April 5, U.S. and Filipino negotiators started a three-month
review of the 1947 agreement governing U.S. bases here. The
agreement expires in 1991.
   Tanada said his bill ``will strengthen the position of our panel
in their negotiations with the U.S.'' A colleague, Sen. Rene
Saguisag, said it gives Mrs. Aquino ``a credible option'' on the
bases issue.
   The president has said she would ``keep her options open'' until
1991.
   Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, an opponent of the bases, said the bill
``will send a very strong signal to the world that the Philippines
is an independent nation.''

   The collapse of the negotiations aimed at
inducing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step down from power in
Panama was greeted with relief on Capitol Hill from Republicans and
Democrats alike Wednesday.
   ``I can't help but welcome this announcement,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``Noriega must go if we are to
achieve our goals in Panama. But sending Noriega off into
retirement with a legal golden parachute ... would have been the
wrong step at the wrong time.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced Wednesday that the
negotiations between the United States and Noriega's
representatives had failed and no further talks were planned.
``Noriega would not carry through with the arrangements his
representatives have negotiated,'' Shultz told an impromptu news
conference.
   Dole had sponsored a resolution overwhelmingly adopted last week
that put the Senate on record in opposition to any deal that would
have dropped U.S. drug-trafficking charges against the Panamanian
leader.
   ``Not only were we going the extra mile to win Noriega's
departure,'' said Dole, ``we may have been going too many extra
miles. Perhaps the signal the Senate was trying to send around this
town, and around the world, was heeded.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., agreed. ``I think we should make no
deals that involve dropping drug charges. That sends the wrong
message, particularly when we are trying to show more resolve
against drugs.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said, ``We missed many
opportunities to get him out. We should not have precluded the use
of force. It's a surrender.''
   ``The administration's negotiations were nothing but bluster and
bluff,'' said D'Amato, a sharp critic of dropping the
drug-trafficking charges. ``It was wishful thinking on the
administration's part.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, ``Frankly, I don't see the
collapse of the proposed deal as a major problem for the United
States. This administration has handled the Noriega situation so
badly that it is an embarrassment to the United States. It wasn't a
good deal for us....
   ``This administration negotiates with the darndest people _
Iranian terrorists and Panamanian drug dealers,'' said Cranston.
``I think we should have an administration which doesn't negotiate
with people like that.''
   ``I think we need a multilateral approach to this problem in
Panama,'' said Cranston.
   Shultz, at the news conference, said the United States would
work through other countries in the hemisphere in pursuit of its
goal to get Noriega out of Panama.
   Meanwhile, Vice President George Bush expressed optimism that
Noriega could be persuaded to step down, telling reporters in
Lakehurst, N.J.: ``I'm convinced Noriega will be out of power.''
   ``The fact that we haven't solved this doesn't depress me,''
said Bush as he pursued his campaign for the presidency. ``I don't
want a bad deal. I want a good deal. We'll have to go back and
figure it out.''
   Bush's aides said last week that the vice president had urged
that talks with Noriega be suspended. However, Bush said while he
and President Reagan had some differences on the matter, they both
had the same ``policy objective of getting Noriega out.''

<HEAD>Fromme Receives Another 15 Months In Prison On Escape Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, serving a life
sentence for her 1975 assassination attempt on President Ford, was
ordered Wednesday to serve an additional 15 months for escaping
from a federal prison.
   The disciple of imprisoned mass murderer Charles Manson told
U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan during the sentencing
hearing that she had no remorse about her Dec. 23 escape.
   Another escape ``floats through my mind now and again,'' Fromme
said. ``I couldn't say I wouldn't try to escape again.''
   Federal attorneys said she would be transferred from the
minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution at Alderson,
W.Va., to another prison.
   The judge also fined Fromme $400.
   Fromme, 39, was sentenced to life in prison after she pointed a
gun at then-President Ford during a visit to California. She was
recaptured on Christmas Day, two days after her escape, about two
miles away from the Alderson prison.
   A U.S. District Court jury in March deliberated less than 10
minutes before finding her guilty of escape. She faced a maximum
additional sentence of five years and a $250,000 fine.
   Fromme acted as her own lawyer during the trial and told the
jury it didn't ``have any choice'' in finding her guilty.
   ``I'm guilty as charged, legally, and without remorse morally,
so that's that,'' she said in closing arguments.
   She testified that overcrowding was one of the reasons she tried
to escape.

   The state government said Wednesday a
gas and kerosene depot in a residential area has been closed and
would be moved because of an explosion and fire that forced
evacation of 100,000 people.
   Spokesman Sergio Villarreal said at least 100,000 residents had
to flee Tuesday as leaping flames threatened to ignite tanks filled
with gasoline.
   No one was seriously injured in the blast Tuesday at the depot
owned by Pemex, the state oil monopoly. However, several
firefighters suffered minor burns and Pemex employee Luis Alonso
said he saw several car accidents caused by fleeing motorists.
   ``The depot is closed,'' Villarreal said. ``It was a state
government decision that was supported by Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex).''
   Villarreal said an unpopulated site on the southern outskirts of
the city of Chihuahua had been selected for the new depot, but he
could not say how long it would take before it is opened.
   Local newspapers and neighborhood organizations had been
demanding for nearly two years that the depot be relocated because
of danger of explosion, the daily Chihuahua newspaper Novedades
said Wednesday.
   A Pemex spokesman, Francisco Cortez Coronado, declined comment
on the depot closing, saying the company was preparing an official
statement.
   The 39-foot-high kerosene tank exploded in a residential area
Tuesday morning while two workers soldered a pipeline at its base.
   Cortez said the cause of the explosion was being investigated.
He estimated damages to be at least $800,000.
   More than 100 Pemex workers and firefighters worked until 8:30
p.m. to put out the blaze, which melted the top third of the
1.1-million-gallon steel tank.
   The nearby gasoline tank, scorched by the blaze, was hosed with
ice water throughout the day to keep the gasoline from reaching its
flashpoint.
   Villarreal said the Texas state government sent 6,000 pounds of
a firefighting solvent known as ``soft water'' to help battle the
blaze.
   Residents were informed shortly after 8 p.m. that they could
return to their homes.
   The Pemex supply depot, which employs about 150 workers, was
built in 1952 in what then was open fields. Now it sits in the
middle of heavily populated residential districts in this city of
700,000, 230 miles south of the Texas border at El Paso.
   The depot, which supplies area gasoline station and other
petroleum users, includes 14 tanks capable of holding 1.1 million
gallons, in addition to several small tanks containing two grades
of gasoline, diesel fuel and kerosene.
   Petroleum products for the area will now be supplied by a Pemex
depot in Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso and by other
depots in Durango and Coahuila states.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson loaded food and medical supplies destined for Central
America onto a truck Wednesday, urging a change in U.S. policy
toward the region.
   Jackson made an impassioned speech to some 300 people gathered
in a parking lot off Fisherman's Wharf, including some veterans who
sponsored the 3,000-mile ``Veterans Peace Convoy'' to Nicaragua.
   Jackson was in the state campaigning for California's June 7
primary, which Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis is favored
to win.
   ``The $10 billion spent chasing 3 million Sandinistas ...that
money should have been spent chasing poverty, illiteracy and
disease and building houses ... in Central America,'' said Jackson.
``It was immoral and illegal and a misappropriation of funds.''
   Jackson's 30-minute address focused on Central America, but he
also referred to the upcoming Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow,
calling it a ``step in the right direction.''
   ``The American-Soviet future is not one of more threats, more
arms buildup, more insecurity in the name of security, weaponizing
the heavens and threatening to destroy the whole planet,'' said
Jackson.
   Jackson also urged the crowd to ``keep hope alive.''
   ``Twenty years ago this year, our dreams were lofty and our
hopes were high. And then Martin Luther King was killed April 4th
and then Robert Kennedy on June 5th,'' Jackson said. ``Our hopes
were dashed, our dreams were busted. We went through a crucifixion.
   ``But now 20 years later, we keep on dreaming. The stone has
been rolled away. Without a crucifixion in California, there's now
a resurrection. New hope, new life, new possibility. And we're
winning every day.''
   Jackson, citing his candidacy as evidence of progress in civil
rights, said ``If we can debate the direction of our nation at the
highest levels, we're winning every day.''

   A Washington attorney convicted of arranging a
bribe for his close friend, federal judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami, refused to testify Wednesday before a House panel
considering Hastings' impeachment.
   Accompanied by two lawyers, William A. Borders invoked his Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination and told the House
Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice that he would ``refuse
to answer any and all questions'' about the case.
   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for
Hastings from two Miami racketeers, Frank and Tom Romano, in
exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. One year later, a
separate trial jury acquitted Hastings of conspiring with Borders
to solicit a bribe from the Romano brothers.
   Borders was fined $35,000, served 33 months in a federal prison
at Allenwood, Pa., and was disbarred by the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals.
   ``I believe that my legal debt to society expired on May 22,
1988, after my release from parole,'' Borders told the House
subcommittee that is investigating impeachment charges by a
judicial panel against Hastings.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who is presiding over the
televised hearings, deferred what he called the subcommittee's
``very difficult'' decision whether to grant Borders immunity from
prosecution to compel his testimony.
   Borders has remained silent about the alleged bribery conspiracy
since he was indicted in late 1981. He refused to testify at both
his and Hastings' trials, and never appeared before a special
investigative panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that
was appointed shortly after Hastings was acquitted.
   The judicial panel, after a 3{-year study, concluded there was
``clear and convincing evidence'' that Hastings not only had
engaged in a bribery schee but tried to conceal his role by lying
under oath and fabricating evidence at his trial.
   Hastings has insisted that he knew nothing of the bribery plot
and accuses Borders of trading on his name in an attempt to shake
down the Romanos. Hastings, who is Florida's first black federal
judge, says the case against him is racially and politically
motivated.
   After Borders was excused, Conyers led the subcommittee in close
and sometimes critical questioning of John Doar, chief counsel to
the five-judge appellate panel whose charges against Hastings
prompted the House impeachment proceedings.
   Conyers said it was ``amazing'' that FBI agents arrested Borders
after he had received $125,000 in bribery money from an undercover
agent posing as Frank Romano, but before Borders could have given
the money to someone else.
   Hastings was staying at a hotel five minutes away when Borders
was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, inside a car with the undercover agent
and a garment bag stuffed with $125,000 in cash.
   A few hours later, Hastings presumably would have met Borders at
an evening boating party which he and other friends were giving in
Borders' honor. But Hastings flew home to Miami shortly after he
learned of Borders' arrest.
   ``The FBI, in effect, broke up its own entrapment,'' Conyers
said. He said that seemed to suggest that ``they didn't believe
there was anyone else involved'' in a bribery scheme.
   Doar said he understood that the FBI ``was not prepared to let
the money get out of their control.'' In any event, he said, the
judicial panel believed there was plenty of other evidence
implicating Hastings in a bribery scheme.
   ``They did not need the money to arrive in Judge Hastings'
hands, no sir,'' Doar said.
   Doar agreed with Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., that the case
against Hastings would have been ``almost impregnable'' if Borders
had actually passed money to Hastings. Edwards said he felt it was
significant that the FBI did not wait to see if this happened.
   Conyers said it also was ``very important'' for his subcommittee
to determine why the Justice Department decided against bringing
perjury charges against Hastings before the statute of limitations
expired in his case in January 1987.
   Under questioning by Conyers, Doar conceded that William Dredge,
a Miami drug runner who tipped authorities to a possible bribery
scheme, could have made ``false and reckless charges against the
judge'' because of Dredge's known racial prejudice.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., asked Doar if ``there is any way you
think you could be wrong'' in contending that Hastings was involved
in a bribery conspiracy and an attempted cover-up.
   Doar, a former assistant U.S. attorney general who was special
counsel for House impeachment proceedings against President Nixon
in 1974, said, ``No there's not.''
   Later, U.S. District Judges William Terrell Hodges of Tampa,
Fla., and Anthony A. Alaimo of Brunswick, Ga., testified about
their decision to file a post-acquittal complaint against Hastings
that sparked the judicial panel's investigation.
   Hodges said their complaint was prompted partly by an appeals
court decision upholding Borders' conviction, which suggested
Hastings may have been involved in a conspiracy with Borders.
Hodges emphatically denied the complaint was filed because Hastings
is black.
   Hastings, allowed to cross-examine his fellow judges, said
``litigants will be the losers when collegiality is destroyed''
among federal judges who file charges against each other.

   The breakdown in negotiations with Panama's
Manuel Antonio Noriega is the latest twist in a bizarre
confrontation that has left the United States seemingly powerless
to engineer the military chief's ouster.
   Instead of controlling events in Panama, U.S. policymakers seem
to be the victims of a wily military chief and of their own failure
to realize the strength of his grip on power.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced the collapse of
the negotiations on Wednesday. He said the United States would
continue efforts to get Noriega out of power, but he announced no
specific steps.
   What to do about Noriega has been a major preoccupation of the
Reagan administration since February, when he was indicted by a
federal grand jury in Miami on charges of taking at least $4.6
million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect
cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug smugglers from law
enforcement officials.
   It's not clear if officials ever thought they would actually be
able to bring Noriega to trial. If they did _ or if they thought
the indictment would lead to a withering of Noriega's power _ they
were mistaken.
   On Feb. 25, in what may have been a move suggested by the United
States, President Eric Arturo Delvalle announced Noriega's
dismissal. Then the Noriega-dominated National Assembly ousted
Delvalle and replaced him with Education Minister Manuel Solis
Palma.
   U.S. pressure began. The Reagan administration continued to
recognize Delvalle. Federal courts blocked the withdrawal of
Panamanian funds from American banks. Economic sanctions were
imposed. Washington gave verbal support to striking Panamanians and
deplored police actions against demonstrators.
   State Department officials whispered privately that Noriega
would be ``history'' in just a few days or weeks at most.
   On March 16, Noriega survived a coup attempt by dissident army
officers and the next day a state of emergency was declared, giving
soldiers power to patrol the capital.
   When pressure didn't work, the United States tried negotiations.
   The first offer, made March 18, was to allow Noriega to go to a
third country and to assure him he would not be extradited to the
United States on the drug charges. The offer was tempered two days
later, when Shultz said the indictments would not be dropped and
that Noriega would have no say in the formation of a transition
government.
   By early May, the situation appeared to be in a stalemate, as
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak began a set of
secret negotiations with Noriega. The U.S. officials who had
predicted Noriega's imminent departure were no longer talking about
it.
   Kozak was reported to have reached a tentative agreement with
Noriega that would include his resignation as defense chief,
departure from the country in August, not to return until after May
1989 elections. The deal also would permit Noriega to have a hand
in forming a transition government.
   The offer divided the administration, because it included the
dismissal of the drug indictments against Noriega. Officials in the
Justice Department and the prosecutors who won the indictments
denounced the proposal.
   Vice President George Bush, who prides himself on his loyalty to
Reagan, had to confront questions every day on whether he supported
dropping the charges. Finally, he made his answer known: he said as
president, he would not negotiate with drug traffickers at home or
abroad.
   Shultz argued that the situation in Panama warranted the
dropping of charges against Noriega _ since he wouldn't allow
himself to be extradited anyway _ and the deal was set.
   In another demonstration of Noriega's power to control events,
Shultz delayed his departure for Helsinki on Wednesday, where he
was to join Reagan in preparatory sessions for next week's
superpower summit in Moscow.
   His wait was in vain. Noriega still said, ``No.''

   European NATO members bristled at U.S.
complaints that they spend too little on defense and insisted on
Wednesday that they were carrying their weight in the alliance.
   They issued a joint rebuttal stressing their non-financial
contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``Europe is taking a fair share of the burdens in the
alliance,'' said Wim van Eekelen, the Dutch defense minister and
chairman of Eurogroup, an informal bloc of 12 European countries.
   Van Eekelen and defense ministers of the other member countries
presented a detailed brochure explaining their current role in NATO.
   The report said that of NATO's standing forces, the United
States' allies provide 90 percent of the manpower and artillery, 80
percent of the tanks and combat aircraft and 65 percent of the
major warships.
   It said 3.5 million European men and women are on active duty
and another 3.5 million are in reserve. The United States has 2.3
million soldiers on active duty and 1.5 million in reserve, the
report said.
   Van Eekelen said he planned to address the issue on behalf of
the European NATO members Thursday at the regular spring meeting of
alliance defense ministers, including U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci.
   The NATO meeting is expected to authorize an in-depth study of
how the allies share the burdens of Western defense and how they
can make better use of funds now available by cooperating more in
building arms.
   Van Eekelen told a news conference that while Washington was
justified in urging the allies to do more for the common defense of
the West, many members of Congress were wrong to say Europe is
shirking its duty.
   ``It's one of the perceptions that have grown steadily, but it
is not entirely warranted,'' van Eekelen said. ``It is important
that the true extent of the European contribution to the alliance
be properly understood.''
   He noted that the administration of President Reagan had taken a
less confrontational approach to the issue than some members of
Congress.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday quoted Reagan as
saying in an interview with European newspapers, ``I don't think
this is an area that should cause bad blood between us.''
   The Eurogroup report acknowledged that all the allies should try
to do more for the common defense, in part by better managing their
budgets.
   ``They recognize that a stronger European defense effort is
necessary in order to maintain the effectiveness of the alliance's
deterrent strategy and to satisfy legitimate American concerns over
burden sharing,'' the report said.
   Van Eekelen said that while U.S. defense spending has grown much
more rapidly than Europe's since Reagan took office in 1981, the
comparison looks much different if calculations are based on a
longer time span.
   Between 1970 and 1987, for example, the defense expenditures of
the European NATO members grew by 34 percent, compared with a 15
percent increase for the United States, the Eurogroup report said.
   Actual U.S. defense spending last year was 6.7 percent of the
U.S. gross national product, which is the broadest measure of
economic output. The equivalent figure for the Europeans was 3.3
percent.
   The Eurogroup report said comparisons of defense spending ``tell
only half the story'' of how the 16 NATO allies share the burdens
of their common defense.
   It said the money figures do not take account of such other
burdens born as environmental damage caused by NATO military
maneuvers. It also cited a sacrifice of income from European real
estate that is dedicated to military bases and other defense
facilities.
   In a related matter, van Eekelen said he expected Thursday's
NATO meeting to issue a formal request for Italy to accept the
basing of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter jets that Spain is forcing off its
territory. The main problem, he said, is deciding how the cost of
transferring the planes and 4,000 U.S. soldiers to Italy will be
shared in NATO.

   A major logjam was broken last week when the panel agreed on
provisions of an outpatient prescription drug benefit to be
provided under Medicare for the first time.
   But the basic foundation of the bill was laid months ago with a
variety of provisions to protect America's 31 million Medicare
beneficiaries against the financial devastation of a prolonged,
acute illness.
   Despite the conference committee agreement, some of the exact
figures that will apply to individual Medicare recipients will have
to be added by technical experts before the final bill is printed
for passage.
   However, the out-of-pocket deductible for doctor bills covered
by Medicare _ the amount paid by each recipient before government
aid starts helping _ will wind up somewhere between $1,320 a year
and $1,400.
   The hospital benefit is already set: full, 365 day-a-year
coverage after a one-day deductible that rises along with average
hospital costs. The 1988 deductible is $540.
   Once fully implemented in 1993, the new prescription drug
benefit will pay 80 percent of those costs after a $655 deductible.
   By contrast, Medicare now pays no more than 80 percent of doctor
bills no matter how high they climb and only 60 days of full
hospital coverage after a one-day deductible.
   The only prescription drugs now covered by Medicare are a
handful of particularly expensive ones such as anti-rejection
medication for organ transplant patients.

   The Organization of African Unity
marked its 25th anniversary Wednesday with calls to unite to crush
South African apartheid and to resolve Africa's $200 billion debt.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, the outgoing OAU chairman,
celebrated the anniversary with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday,
OAU,'' as he cut a cake.
   The African states declared ``our determination to be master of
our own destiny'' in an 11-page declaration marking the jubilee.
The states called for total political and economical liberation of
the continent.
   Many of the 40 points in the declaration resembled previous OAU
resolutions. The declaration offers no new plans of action.
   It expressed disappointment at ``inadequate support'' provided
by the international community despite promises to provide money to
help Africa put austerity programs into effect.
   Groups from Sudan, Zambia, Guinea and Algeria danced and sang as
African leaders planted trees and unveiled a marble plaque with
gold engraving of the organization's silver jubilee theme: Unity,
Solidarity, Liberation, Development.
   A helicopter gunship roared overhead, but otherwise security was
light for the more than 30 heads of government and state gathered
at the 50-member body's headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's
capital.
   In Zimbabwe, which won independence eight years ago and is the
OAU's youngest member state, the Harare Herald newspaper praised
the organization as having played a key role in ending colonial
domination, prescribing ways of resolving the African debt, and
promoting regional cooperation in transport, communications, health
programs and refugee care.
   Those attending the celebration in Ethiopia included Hosni
Mubarak, of Egypt, who wore a dark suit; Jerry Rawlings of Ghana,
in camouflage fatigues and dark glasses; Sadiq el-Mahdi of Sudan,
in flowing white robes and turban; and Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida
of Nigeria, in khaki dress uniform emblazoned with red and gold
braid.
   Kaunda said that although 19 African nations had achieved
independence since the organization's founding May 25, 1963, the
OAU should resist complacency.
   ``Africa must rise to strike the last blow against the racist
regime of South Africa to rid the continent of the last bastion of
racism and colonialism,'' he said. ``We must therefore be even more
united than before.''
   The celebration is followed by a three-day summit that begins
Thursday.
   Denunciation of South Africa is a familiar theme at OAU
gatherings and summits, which always end with calls to crush
apartheid and with criticism of Western governments for failing to
impose mandatory sanctions on South Africa's white-dominated
government.
   The OAU also calls regularly for the freeing of Namibia, which
is under South African control.
   At the same time, black Africa does about $1 billion a year in
business with South Africa, much of it covertly.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a
commentary that the OAU had failed to resolve the continent's major
problems.
   ``There will be much South Africa-bashing to cover up the lack
of unity, the social and economic crisis that plagues the continent
_ and the heart-rending suffering of the people of Africa,'' it
said of the gathering.
   OAU Secretary-general Ide Oumarou of Niger said Africa's
economic problems have weakened the organization's impact.
   ``The words of a united Africa would have been more resounding
if its political and diplomatic influence had been matched by its
economic power,'' he said.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia said the OAU could
count among its successes the rapprochement between Ethiopia and
Somalia, who restored diplomatic ties in April after an 11-year
break following the Ogaden desert war.
   The OAU was not directly involved in the Ethiopia-Somalia
rapprochement and has had limited success in mediation. Last year,
Kaunda persuaded members Chad and Libya to accept a cease-fire in
their territorial dispute after the United Nations failed to do so.
   President Hissene Habre of Chad attended the OAU's silver
jubilee, but Col. Moammar Gadhafi of Libya stayed away from the
meeting, as he has in recent years.

   CBS officials said Wednesday that getting the
television rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics was the first step in
rebuilding the beleaguered network and making it No. 1 again.
   ``It's going to be a hard fight, but we're ready for an all-out
assault,'' CBS President Laurence Tisch said.
   The longtime ratings leader among the three major networks
slipped to last place this season. But Tisch said the network's
winning $243 million bid Tuesday for the Winter Games in
Albertville, France, shows that CBS is determined to regain its
former status.
   ``We're on the right track _ we just have to get the train
moving faster,'' he said at a news conference.
   CBS, which last televised the Olympics in 1960, outbid NBC by
$68 million for the Albertville Games. CBS Sports president Neal
Pilson said he expected CBS to make a small profit on the Games,
but NBC Sports president Arthur Watson said Pilson was ``blowing
smoke.''
   Tisch, also chief executive officer of CBS, called the bid
``very realistic.''
   ``I think we can make money,'' he said. ``At worst, I see us
breaking even.''
   Gene Jankowski, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said the
bid reflected CBS' ``new aggressiveness.''
   ``We are not the No. 1 network, but we intend to be,'' he said.
``We have promised our affiliates that we will go after the big
events, and that's what we're doing.''

   A newspaper said Wednesday the army
rejected a U.S. proposal for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to step
down because it did not guarantee his chosen president would remain
in power.
   ``The high command of the Defense Forces and the Strategic
Military Council rejected the points of conversation because they
found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate
of President Manuel Solis Palma,'' said the pro-government La
Republica, citing sources it did not identify.
   The front-page story carried the headline ``There is No
Agreement.''
   It said the military believed ``there would be security risks,
political confrontations among Panamanians'' and that the U.S.
proposal would impede the process of turning over the Panama Canal.
Treaties signed in 1977 require the United States to relinquish
control of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The report in the afternoon paper said the military leaders felt
any further talks should be held ``in a broader parameter in which
other sectors of the Panamanian state might be included.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz announced Wednesday afternoon
in Washington that the talks had collapsed.
   When the negotiations on Noriega's removal began several weeks
ago, the United States insisted on retaining Eric Arturo Delvalle
as president. That position appeared to have softened recently.
   Delvalle was deposed by Noriega on Feb. 26, a day after the
president tried to fire Noriega. The United States continues to
recognize Delvalle's presidency.
   There was no immediate public comment from Noriega on the
failure of the talks. He is to address the Legislative Assembly on
Thursday, said an assembly spokesman.
   Noriega, the head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces, is under
federal indictment in Florida for drug trafficking. Removal of the
indictments was reportedly part of the agreement that had been
considered.
   Other terms were said to be lifting U.S. economic sanctions,
Noriega's departure from Panama at least temporarily and agreement
on who should head the civilian government until May 1989 elections.
   Sources close to Romulo Escobar Betancourt, Noriega's chief
negotiator with the United States, told The Associated Press early
Wednesday that the two sides still had not reached agreement on
what would happen to $50 million in Panamanian funds frozen in
American banks and on the status of Solis Palma, whom Noriega
installed as president after deposing Delvalle.
   Hours later, Shultz announced that the talks were off.
   DelValle has been in hiding in Panama since he was deposed and
warrants are out for his arrest, although the Panamian government
has made no serious recent attempt to find him.
   The military has been the de facto ruler in this country of 2.2
million since 1968 when Gen. Omar Torrijos ousted Arnulfo Arias
Madrid.
   Panamanian-American relations have dropped in the past year to a
25-year low. The U.S. economic sanctions have taken a heavy toll on
Panama's economy.
   International confidence in Panama's banking industry has been
shaken and scores of businesses have gone bankrupt or are
struggling to stay open.
   The opposition press has been silenced since early this year.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of Panama's opposition
Christian Democratic Party, said recently it may take a generation
to restore Panama to what it was economically and socially before
the crisis.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese Parliament on Wednesday approved a new
nuclear cooperation pact with the United States that the U.S.
Congress had accepted earlier.
   The 30-year agreement allows Japan to transfer spent nuclear
fuel from the United States to reprocessing plants in Britain and
France without seeking U.S. permission each time. It was required
to do so under a previous agreement.
   The new accord also limits cooperation to peaceful purposes and
allows Japan to bring in American-made nuclear materials, including
plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons.
   During heated U.S. congressional debate on the pact in March,
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, expressed concern about potential risks of
nuclear proliferation, terrorism and environmental damage.
   Yozo Hosokawa, an official at the Science and Technology Agency,
said the new pact will go into effect as early as fall.

   The Soviet Union announced Wednesday for the first
time how many casualties it suffered in Afghanistan, with a Red
Army general telling a nationwide television audience that 13,310
soldiers died in the war.
   Gen. Alexei D. Lizichev also said 35,478 soldiers were wounded
and 311 are missing from the Soviet Union's 8{-year battle with
Moslem insurgents.
   Soviet soldiers began leaving their bases May 15 in accordance
with a peace accord signed in Geneva that aims to end foreign
involvement in the Afghan civil war and improve chances for
internal resolution of the 10-year-old conflict.
   The general said in a news briefing which was also carried on
the evening news program ``Vremya'' that the death and injury tolls
included casualties suffered between Dec. 27, 1979, when Soviet
troops and tanks entered the war, and May 1. The total of 49,099
dead, wounded and missing was slightly higher than some Western
analysts estimated.
   A U.S. State Department report last year estimated there had
been 33,000 to 38,000 casualties, about one-third of which were
deaths.
   Lizichev said the Soviet government would make every effort to
learn the fate of the missing soldiers, and indicated that there
would be no barriers to the return of those ``who fell into the
hands of the opposition or found themselves abroad.'' He appeared
to be referring to deserters as well as prisoners of war.
   Lizichev's casualty figures were in line with Soviet journalist
Eduard Rosental's statement May 19 that news reports estimating
deaths between 12,000 and 15,000 were ``more or less correct.''
   The war in Afghanistan often has been compared to U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, where about 58,000 Americans were killed
and about 150,000 were wounded.
   Since the withdrawal began 10 days ago, 9,500 Soviet troops have
left their bases, as well as 1,000 pieces of military equipment,
Lizichev reported.
   Asked whether the departing forces had suffered any casualties,
the general replied that there had been ``attempts to prevent them
from leaving,'' but that there had been no marked increase in rebel
attacks.
   He declined to verify the size of the Soviet contingent in
Afghanistan. But Western intelligence reports have indicated that
prior to the start of the withdrawal, about 115,000 Soviet soldiers
were in Afghanistan to back the government of President Najib
against anti-communist rebels.
   Lizichev and Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov held fast
to the Kremlin position that sending Soviet troops into a
neighboring country's civil war was justified.
   ``Soviet troops had been invited to Afghanistan by the
government,'' Vorontsov said. ``That is a fact. This cannot be
reassessed.''
   Lizichev was asked whether Soviet advisers would remain behind
after the withdrawal is completed, and replied that if the Afghans
appealed for such assistance, ``we would consider this request.''
   Najib told reporters in Kabul last month that his government was
counting on the continued help of Soviet advisers.
   Vorontsov was asked whether the retreat signaled an end to the
Brezhnev Doctrine, former leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's policy of
military intervention to protect socialist revolutionary gains.
   ``This was not our baby,'' Vorontsov said of the doctrine. But
he added that the Soviet armed forces are committed to protecting
allies as well as Soviet territory.
   Lizichev said Soviet policy has not changed, that conditions
appeared only recently that allowed the Kremlin to leave the Afghan
troops to fight on their own.
   Soviet officials and the state-run media have cast the pullout
as a successful conclusion to the war.
   The U.N.-mediated Geneva accords require all Soviet soldiers to
be out of Afghanistan within nine months, and half of the
contingent to withdraw by Aug. 15.
   Lt.-Gen. Boris Gromov, head of the Afghan-based troops, told
reporters in Kabul before the start of the withdrawal that 25
percent of the soldiers would leave before President Reagan's visit
to Moscow, which begins Sunday.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Afghan government charged for the fourth
time in recent days that Pakistan is violating provisions of the
peace accord that prohibit arms transfers to the anti-communist
rebels.
   Much of the weaponry supplied to the insurgents has come from
the United States, and Vorontsov joked that some of the
U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles provided to the rebels have been
captured by Soviet forces. After claiming that the insurgents were
selling the Stingers to other countries for as much as $300,000,
Vorontsov said the Kremlin had obtained some ``free of charge.''

   A woman who said she had ``had it up to my nose
with doctors and monitors with my children'' is under criminal
investigation after she had four children die before the age of 4
months, officials said Wednesday.
   A family court judge ruled that Bonnie Lambert and her husband,
Bruce, were guilty of ``at the very least, gross negligence'' and
issued a finding of abuse of their only surviving child, a
10-month-old boy who is currently in foster care.
   One of the children who died had previously been held at a
hospital because the city's Special Services for Children
department had received anonymous reports that the mother was
killing her children for insurance money to sustain her drug habit,
Judge Judith Sparrow said in her report.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman confirmed
Wednesday she was investigating the three deaths that occurred in
her borough.
   ``The circumstances under which these infants died are under
investigation by my office. This matter is being taken very
seriously and is being investigated thoroughly,'' Holtzman said in
a statement.
   Sparrow called the parents' descriptions of how their children
died ``inconsistent and incredible'' in the May 2 decision, made
public Tuesday.
   The decision was in response to a petition by the city alleging
that the Lamberts abused their surviving child, Bruce Jr., through
reckless disregard for his care. No specific acts of physical abuse
were alleged. A hearing to determine the child's future is
scheduled for Friday.
   A call to the Lamberts' attorney, Jeffrey Karan, was not
returned Wednesday.
   Sparrow's decision outlined the deaths of the four infants. The
report, based on the Lamberts' testimony, medical and social
workers' accounts and other records, said:
   _Kristen, the couple's first child, died in August 1983 five
weeks after birth in Monticello, N.Y., of apparent natural causes.
The medical examiner's report said the baby died of cardiac arrest
and pneumonia.
   _A daughter, Heather, was hospitalized three weeks after birth
in June 1985 for an apnea disorder, described as a tendency to stop
breathing without cause. She died in July at age 5 weeks, just 1{
days after being released from the hospital.
   The judge said Maimonides Hospital gave the Lamberts a monitor
to record Heather's breathing and heart rate. The parents testified
they used the monitor but ``aspects of their description ... lacked
veracity,'' Sparrow wrote.
   Heather's cause of death was given as sudden infant death
syndrome, but no autopsy was performed because the parents opposed
it.
   _A third daughter, Erin, was diagnosed as having drug withdrawal
symptoms shortly after birth Oct. 10, 1986, and doctors recommended
that she be monitored for the apnea disorder. She died Feb. 9, 1987.
   Mrs. Lambert admitted she missed Erin's follow-up medical
appointments and told the judge she ``had it up to my nose with
doctors and monitors with my children,'' the judge's decision said.
Erin's cause of death was listed as SIDS but later changed to
``sudden unexplained death, circumstances undetermined.''
   _The last infant to die was Jason, the twin of surviving Bruce
Jr. Sparrow said the twins were kept at a hospital after the
children's services department received the anonmymous reports that
the mother had killed the children to collect insurance money.
   The department had previously received such reports, the judge's
decision said. A social worker was assigned to the family after the
third death and had been in contact with the parents.
   The allegations of abuse were evidently not confirmed, and the
twins were released to the parents, authorities said. Jason died
last October, with the cause of death listed as SIDS. Bruce Jr. was
then placed in foster care.
   The twins had infrequent bouts of apnea during their hospital
stay, but a doctor who handled the case said Mrs. Lambert told him
she did not plan to use monitors with them, Sparrow said.
   The physician, Dr. Sheela Laungani, told the judge it was
extremely rare for there to be multiple deaths in one family from
SIDS.
   The child's maternal grandparents have requested custody of the
child, said Lenore Gittis of the Legal Aid Society's juvenile
rights division.

<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old man who has never even
received a traffic ticket now may go to prison for killing his
ailing wife.
   Oscar Carlson has admitted he shot and killed his wife, Agnes,
at a nursing home Feb. 29, but said he did so to end her suffering
from Alzheimer's disease.
   Carlson pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a
maximum 43-month sentence. The agreement departs from state
sentencing guidelines, which call for an 18-year sentence for
second-degree murder.
   Still, Carlson's attorneys held out hope that during sentencing,
Douglas County Judge Paul Ballard would send the retired farmer to
a nursing home where he could be cared for and receive counseling.
Carlson has been free on bond.
   ``He believes what he did was right,'' said attorney Michael
Dolan. ``But over and above that I believe we have presented
significant evidence to show the great pressure he was under from
caring for her.''
   A hearing was held Wednesday, but a decision was delayed a day
when the prosecutor said one witness could not appear until
Thursday.
   Douglas County Attorney Ann Carrott had opposed even the
43-month sentence. Although she feels compassion toward Carlson,
she said, she believes sentencing guidelines should be followed.
She also presented a witness Wednesday who suggested that Mrs.
Carlson had been abused by her husband.
   ``The focus of the defense attorneys has been on the stress that
Oscar Carlson was under, and obviously there are some issues of the
life of the victim and her general surroundings that I believe are
just as important,'' Ms. Carrott said.
   Carlson testified last month during his sentencing hearing that
his wife of nearly 47 years asked to be shot. Carlson said he shot
her four times with a .22-caliber pistol and then sat down to pray
and watch her die.
   The shooting occurred at the Crestview Manor Nursing Home in
Evansville a day after Agnes Carlson had broken a hip in a fall.
Carlson testified that when he heard his wife, who had suffered
four years with Alzheimer's disease, would require surgery ``my
mind cracked.''
   ``I couldn't take no more,'' he said.
   Relatives said they were crushed by Mrs. Carlson's death, but
forgave Carlson.
   ``He's still our father and we understand it was hard on him,''
said Mildred Penuel of Fargo, N.D., Carlson's youngest daughter.
``Alzheimer's is a disease that's very hard on the caretaker.
   ``I hope that some good will come out of this and people will be
a little more understanding of those who are caring for sufferers
of Alzheimer's disease.''
   All three of Carlson's daughters testified last month that they
hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he
was under and his age.
   ``We're talking about a man who's never even had a traffic
ticket before this,'' said Tom Reif, another attorney representing
Carlson. ``I do not think sending him to prison at his age would
serve society at all.''
   But during Wednesday's hearing, Barbara Walters, director of the
Crestview nursing home, testified that staff members became
concerned about Mrs. Carlson and the care she received when Carlson
took her out of the nursing home for brief visits at home.
   She said staff members noticed bruises on Mrs. Carlson's body
after some of the visits. After returning from one visit in August
1987, Mrs. Carlson told the staff, ``I'm glad to be here. That man
really pounded on me,'' Mrs. Walters said, reading from a nursing
report.
   On cross-examination by Reif, Mrs. Walters said nursing
officials were aware that Mrs. Carlson bruised easily and
sometimes, because of her Alzheimer's, said things that were
untrue. She said an investigation by the Douglas County Social
Services Department determined that reports of alleged abuse were
unfounded.
   Bonnie Campeau, administrator of the home, also testified
Wednesday, saying that Carlson had complained to her on numerous
occasions about the cost of Mrs. Carlson's care.

<HEAD>Cold Front Triggers Rain on East Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front stretching from New England into the Southeast
Wednesday carried rain along the East Coast from Maine to the
Florida Keys.
   Scattered thunderstorms also rumbled over the Texas Panhandle
and into New Mexico, central Colorado and northeast Utah.
   In Florida, heavy storms doused the Keys, with wind gusts of 65
mph clocked at Marathon. Cudjoe Key reported gusts of 57 mph and
Boca Chica, 50 mph. Homestead, just south of Miami, got 1.53 inches
in the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Rain spread from central New England through the Middle Atlantic
States, with many locales reporting between a quarter and half-inch
of rain falling during the morning. Brunswick and Portland, Maine;
Hartford, Conn.; Concord, N.H., and Willow Grove, Pa., all received
more than a half-inch of rain in a six-hour period.
   Overnight frost warnings were issued for western Pennsylvania
and western New York.
   Elsewhere, skies were partly cloudy across the Great Lakes and
the Pacific Northwest. It was mostly sunny over the Southwestern
states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 98 at Needles, Calif., and Phoenix,
Ariz. The morning low for the nation was 21 degrees at South Lake
Tahoe, Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
central and southern Florida, with the heaviest rain across the
southern third of the state. More widely scattered showers were
predicted over the northern Pacific Coast and the northern high
Plains of Montana and over the central Rockies into the northern
Plains. Sunny skies should prevail elsewhere.
   High temperatures should be in the 70s or 80s across much of the
nation, dipping into the 60s along the central and northern Pacific
Coast, and from the lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through the
Middle Atlantic states into New England. In the Southwest, highs
should read from the middle 90s to 105 in desert regions.

   Here are capsule summaries of the financial
disclosure form filed by members of the House from Minnesota for
1987 and released Wednesday.
   Income includes the House salary, honoraria earnings from
writing and speeches and other income such as dividends and
interest.
   Earnings by the representatives' spouses and dependents are not
included in the income figure.
   The asset and liability figures for the representatives do not
include holdings and liabilities of spouses and dependents.
   Representatives are permitted to keep honoraria earnings from
speeches and writings up to 30 percent of their salary. For nearly
all members, their salary was $89,500 at the end of 1987. The
speaker of the House was paid at the annualized rate of $115,000
and the Democratic and Republican leaders were paid at the
annualized rate of $99,500.
   Many members receive honoraria above the limit and donate the
excess to charity.
   In their financial disclosure forms, representatives are allowed
to list income, assets and liabilities by ranges instead of
specific figures. However, some representatives provide specific
figures.
   In their listing of assets, representatives do not have to
include their personal residences and vehicles. Gifts, though
listed, are not counted in income figure given here.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says Libya's War with Chad Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday declared an end to
Libya's war with Chad and said he now recognizes the Chadian
government, Libyan television reported.
   The Libyan leader also said that Chadian prisoners will be
handed over to the Organization of African Unity and that Libya
will resolve all its problems with Chad in a ``friendly and
fraternal way.''
   He made his remarks to African ambassadors in Tripoli, the
Libyan capital, in a speech marking the 25th anniversary of the
OAU. The address was broadcast by Libyan television and monitored
in London.
   Gadhafi has declared the Chad war over before, most recently in
September 1987.
   He said he was making his Wednesday declaration so the 50-nation
OAU _ which has been trying to resolve the Libya-Chad dispute for
12 years _ could concentrate on solving Africa's economic problems,
confronting racism in South Africa, supporting the Palestinians,
and other issues.
   A spokesman for Chad's delegation at the OAU meeting in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, said Wednesday night that President Hissene Habre
of Chad could not be reached for comment because of the late hour.
   However, the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted that Habre said Tuesday he was ``very optimistic'' about the
possibility of resolving the dispute with Libya.
   Gadhafi also used the occasion to declare unilaterally that
Libya will resume ties with eight African countries _ Kenya,
Liberia, Zaire, Mauritius, Gabon, Senegal, Gambia and Ivory Coast.
   ``We want this day to be a day of joy for Africa and a reduction
in the burden of the organization so that it may devote itself to
the historic objectives for which it was set up: the unity of
Africa and the liberation of Africa,'' Gadhafi said.
   ``In order to salute and express appreciation for this day, the
day of Africa, the leadership of the (Libyan) revolution wants to
declare the following as a present to Africa on the 25th
anniversary. Libya declares its recognition of Chad and ends all
the outstanding problems between it and Chad.''
   Chad and Libya declared a cease-fire last September, but Chad
has accused Libya of continuing to mass troops for an attack. Libya
entered Chad in 1983 in support of rebels led by former Chadian
President Goukouni Queddei. France, the one-time colonial ruler of
Chad, gave military support to Habre, who ousted Goukouni in June
1982.
   Habre's forces pushed Libyan troops out of Chad early last year,
but Chad and Libya continued to dispute the mineral-rich Aouzou
Strip on Chad's extreme northern border. An OAU committe was set up
to examine the issue.
   Gadhafi invited Goukouni and Habre to met in Libya and said
``Libya will do its utmost for the sake of national reconciliation
between them.''
   He said that if Chad does return to civil war, ``Libya announces
that it will not intervene.''
   Gadhafi said Libya was offering what he described as a Libyan
``Marshall Plan'' to reconstruct northern Chad.
   The Marshall Plan was set up by the United States to aid in
European recovery after World War II.
   Gadhafi also said that that under the Libyan Constitution the
country did not to have a head of state and so his absence at the
OAU meeting should not offend that organization.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, dogged by a foreign
policy problem he wanted to leave behind, arrived here early
Thursday en route to a Moscow summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev
after proclaiming that superpower relations have ``come a long
way'' since their 1985 face-off in Geneva.
   Less than an hour before Air Force One touched down, Secretary
of State George P. Shultz in Washington announced the collapse of
negotiations to get Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
to relinquish power.
   Nevertheless, Reagan said, ``I don't feel weakened'' by the
foreign policy setback going into the summit.
   The administration had hoped the long stalemate with Noriega
would be broken before Reagan reaches Moscow, thus sparing him any
embarrassment that would distract attention from the talks with
Gorbachev.
   Asked at a picture-taking session with Finnish President Mauno
Koivisto if he felt foolish about the Noriega situation, Reagan
replied, ``I just don't feel that way.''
   In Washington, Shultz announced the negotiations had reached an
impasse and that the United States was withdrawing its offer to
drop drug charges against Noriega if he left the country.
   Reagan was upbeat as he left the White House on Wednesday,
giving a mostly sunny assessment of relations between Moscow and
Washington. But he acknowledged that ``we have many differences _
deep differences.''
   ``There will be plenty of work for Mr. Gorbachev and me in
Moscow next week,'' Reagan said. ``I do not expect it to be easy.''
   Reagan did not take with him a ratified Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty, but Senate leaders said they hoped
to win approval of the pact by week's end so it can be rushed to
Moscow for a ceremonial exchange of treaty-ratification documents
with Gorbachev.
   It was with much pomp that Reagan and Gorbachev signed the
treaty during their last meeting _ in Washington last December.
   Reagan planned to use the four-day Helsinki stopover to prepare
for the summit and to adjust to the eight-hour time difference
between Moscow and Washington.
   He was greeted at the Helsinki-Vantaa Airport by Koivisto and
his wife, Tellervo.
   Spotlights flooded the tarmac and a red carpet was rolled out to
Air Force One for Reagan's arrival.
   Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Moscow at mid-afternoon Sunday
for a four-day summit expected to be short on substance and long on
ceremony. He had conceded beforehand that there was virtually no
likelihood of a breakthrough on a long-range missile accord.
   Reagan's trip marks the first visit to the Soviet Union by a
sitting president since Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford made separate
trips there in 1974.
   Reagan, 77, has never visited the Soviet Union, although he
spent much of his long career speaking of America's challenges in
the face of rising Soviet power.
   Reflecting on his three previous summits with Gorbachev,
beginning with the November 1985 meeting in Geneva, the president
said in his remarks Wednesday: ``We have come a long way since
then.''
   However, he said, ``We have many differences _ deep differences,
moral differences. But we are still fellow human beings. We can
still work together to keep the peace.''
   The face-off in Moscow follows summits between Reagan and
Gorbachev in Geneva; in Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986 and in
Washington last December. Reagan also has held out the possibility
of a fifth get-together later this year _ if the two sides are
close to agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   Several hundred people, including Soviet Ambassador Yuri
Dubynin, stood on the South Lawn of the White House to hear the
president make his departure remarks as aides held umbrellas over
him and the first lady.
   But the umbrella failed to keep the president dry. Mrs. Reagan
was overheard remarking to him: ``Honey, you're just soaked.'' He
answered, ``I know it.'' She then asked, ``Why didn't you put on a
raincoat?'' His answer could not be heard.
   As the brief ceremony ended, the Navy's Blue Angels precision
flight team staged a low-altitude fly-by.
   Reagan outlined high expectations for the summit _ with the
caveat that ``I do not expect it to be easy.''
   Reagan said he will press Gorbachev for continued human rights
improvements, for help in ending conflicts in Angola, Namibia and
Central America and for assistance to ``prevent a manmade crisis of
starvation'' in Ethiopia.
   He gave a laundry list of superpower accomplishments in recent
years, including the medium-range missile treaty, and said he could
supply more evidence of improved relations, ``but I'd miss my
plane.''
   ``My task next week will be to go still farther, farther in the
interests of peace, farther toward a universal respect for
fundamental human rights, farther toward world freedom, farther
toward a safer world for all people,'' he said.
   ``We will urge the Soviets to help move the Middle East peace
process closer to a just and lasting solution,'' Reagan said. ``And
we will look for ways to help the parties resolve other regional
conflicts in Africa, Asia, and yes, Central America.''
   Reagan will spend three days relaxing in Helsinki, making final
summit preparations and trying to adjust to the eight-hour time
difference in Moscow.
   The Reagans will stay in a third-floor suite of a plush guest
house equipped with a small indoor pool and sauna. It is located in
a suburb about a 15-minute drive from downtown Helsinki.
   Soon after his arrival in Moscow on Sunday, Reagan and Gorbachev
will begin their first round of talks at the Kremlin.
   Both nations say it will be impossible to wrap up a treaty next
week to curb strategic nuclear weapons. But officials on both sides
say they hope to make progress in ironing out some obstacles in
hopes an agreement will be completed before Reagan leaves office
next January.
   Shultz said the United States will make new proposals to keep
track of mobile missiles, one of the key disputes blocking a treaty.

   Here are capsule summaries of the financial
disclosure forms filed by members of the House from Arizona for
1987 and released Wednesday.
   Income includes the House salary, honoraria earnings from
writing and speeches and other income such as dividends and
interest.
   Earnings by the representatives' spouses and dependents are not
included in the income figure.
   The asset and liability figures for the representatives do not
include holdings and liabilities of spouses and dependents.
   Representatives are permitted to keep honoraria earnings from
speeches and writings up to 30 percent of their salary. For nearly
all members, their salary was $89,500 at the end of 1987. The
speaker of the House was paid at the annualized rate of $115,000
and the Democratic and Republican leaders were paid at the
annualized rate of $99,500.
   Many members receive honoraria above the limit and donate the
excess to charity.
   In their financial disclosure forms, representatives are allowed
to list income, assets and liabilities by ranges instead of
specific figures. However, some representatives provide specific
figures.
   In their listing of assets, representatives do not have to
include their personal residences and vehicles. Gifts, though
listed, are not counted in income figure given here.

   Two honey-haired young girls brought
traffic to a crawl and tears to the eyes of motorists reading their
sign ``Will Work For Food.''
   Michelle Cannon, 8, and her sister Shirley, 6, were holding the
sign Tuesday for their father, who moved his family from
Philadelphia earlier this month and spent their $1,500 savings in
the process.
   The sight of the blue-eyed girls and their cardboard sign
inspired an outpouring of $20 bills and sympathy.
   ``I saw those two kids there and I just started crying,'' said
Hallandale postal worker Alicia McLoughlin, 36, who gave the
children's father, Bill Cannon, $3 in coins. ``It was all I had,''
she said, before returning 30 minutes later to give him two $20
bills.
   In two hours, Cannon collected $135 and the promise of a day's
work Saturday for $100.
   Even police contributed, but the officer who pushed $5 into
Cannon's hand refused to be identified.
   State social workers were not touched. They told Cannon his
children should have been in school where they have been registered.
   ``You're doing a dangerous thing, having these kids out here,''
said social worker Brenda Miller. ``You shouldn't be playing upon
the emotions of people with these kids.''
   Cannon said he would not use the girls to seek work again.
   ``I just want to get on my feet,'' he said.
   Cannon, his wife Bonnie, 27, Shirley, Michelle, sister Samantha,
5, and brother Jesse, 16, have been living in a $150-a-week
Hollywood hotel since their 1964 truck broke down there. Earlier
breakdowns cost the family its savings.

   Israeli-allied militiamen backed by
Israeli air strikes stormed guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on
Wednesday. Pro-Iranian guerrillas reported 25 of their fighters
killed and 20 missing.
   Police also said four Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the
Palestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh on Sidon's outskirts late
Wednesday, killing a PLO guerrilla and wounding four.
   The helicopters, dropping parachute flares, destroyed a base of
the mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization in the 10:05 p.m. (4:05 p.m. EDT) strike,
police said.
   The Israeli army command in Jerusalem later announced that
Israeli warplanes hit the Ein el-Hilweh base at about 11 p.m. and
scored accurate hits despite anti-aircraft fire.
   Despite discrepancies, the Israeli and the Lebanese accounts
apparently were referring to the same air strike.
   Earlier in the day, Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main ally
in Lebanon, said 25 of its men were killed in a daylong sweep by
the South Lebanon Army militia supported by Israeli helicopter
gunships.
   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said 17 guerillas were
wounded and 20 were missing. The predominantly Christian SLA said
five of its fighters were injured.
   The assault on three villages in south Lebanon began at daybreak
and ended at nightfall, when the attacking force rolled back to its
base in Israel's self-designated ``security zone,'' the SLA's Voice
of the South radio station said.
   Lebanon instructed its U.N. mission to ``lodge a strong worded
complaint against the Israeli-sponsored aggression'' with the
Security Council, an official statement said.
   The action in the south came as Hezbollah concentrated its
efforts on the battle for control of Shiite Moslem slums in south
Beirut.
   Syria reportedly warned Hezbollah not to harm any of the 18
foreign hostages _ including nine Americans _ believed held in the
slums, site of a bloody 20-day battle between Hezbollah and the
pro-Syrian Amal militia.
   The Beirut newspaper An-Nahar said Syria told Hezbollah that
harming any of the hostages would be viewed as an ``infringement of
Syria's security.''
   It gave no source for its report and did not elaborate. Syrian
spokesmen declined comment.
   The captive held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was captured on March 16,
1985.
   A Belgian physician, Dr. Jan Cools, was reported missing
Wednesday in south Lebanon, but there was no word on whether he had
been kidnapped.
   The Norwegian Aid Committee said Cools, 32, a general
practitioner, left the Qasimiyeh refugee camp on Saturday, heading
for the Rashidiyeh shantytown eight miles to the south. He never
reached Rashidiyeh.
   On Tuesday, Hezbollah consolidated its grip on more than 90
percent of south Beirut.
   Syrian troops and tanks surround the slums and Syria has
threatened to move in and stop the battle.
   Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, drove to Damascus
for a meeting with Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam of Syria.
Sources close to Hoss said he asked that the Syrian army be sent
into the slums and that Hussein Husseini, speaker of Lebanon's
Parliament, was expected to make a similar plea.
   Syria is Tehran's main Arab ally but has been alarmed by Iran's
attempt through Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiites, the largest sect in the country.
   The intensity of the south Beirut slum war decreased
significantly Wednesday, with only automatic weapons fire reported.
Police said they had no word on casualties.
   The fighting has killed 296 people and wounded 1,000 since May 6.
   A police spokesman said Hezbollah was reorganizing its forces,
apparently preparing ``for a final push'' against Shiyah, Amal's
last stronghold in the 16 square miles of slums.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   An attorney for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega says he
isn't convinced talks are off between the indicted Panamanian
leader and U.S. officials, despite Secretary of State George
Shultz's statement to that effect Wednesday.
   ``I've heard that only from the secretary of state, and I
remember hearing the secretary of state say that last March,'' Neal
Sonnett said after the Shultz announcement.
   ``That was followed by more negotiations over the last 10 days,
so I don't think it would be useful to comment on whether the
negotiations are at a permanent end or not,'' said Sonnett, one of
several Miami attorneys for Noriega, who faces drug indictments in
Miami and Tampa.
   The federal prosecutors who brought those indictments last
February remain eager to meet him him in court rather than have
charges dropped in a poltical deal in which Noriega would give up
power.
   ``I stand ready to prosecute Mr. Noriega,'' said Robert Merkle,
U.S. attorney in Tampa.
   However, getting the defendant to Florida to stand trial won't
be easy because Noriega cannot be extradited by the United States.
   ``I offered him a trip to Disney World, but I don't think he'll
take me up on that,'' Merkle said.
   Merkle's successful prosecution of Colombian drug kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas took place after Lehder was captured in a Colombian
jungle and immediately flown to Tampa.
   Noriega is charged in a 12-count indictment in Miami with taking
at least $4.6 million in payoffs from the violent Medellin drug
cartel led by Lehder and others.
   The three-count Tampa indictment accused Noriega of helping
smuggle 1 million pounds of marijuana.
   Both Merkle and Leon Kellner, U.S. attorney in Miami, were
opposed to dropping their drug charges against Noriega in exchange
for his giving up power in Panama.
   ``All I can say is we are prepared to go forward with the case
and we will do so,'' Kellner said, declining further comment.
   But Sonnett said he thought charges against his client could
well be dismissed _ and not necessarily as a result of negotiations.
   ``I have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the
indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so,'' he
said. ``We still feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a
variety on various grounds.''

   A Boeing 737 that lost all power and made an
emergency landing on a narrow canal bank was battered by hail, but
possible fuel problems were also being examined, officials said
Wednesday.
   The TACA International jet carrying about 40 passengers lost
power in both its engines twice Tuesday afternoon about 20 miles
from New Orleans International Airport. The pilot set the plane
safely down between a drainage ditch and the Intracoastal Waterway.
   ``As far as we know, this is the first successful off-airport
dead-stick (no power) landing of a commercial jet,'' said Warren
Wandel, National Transportation Safety Board inspector.
   Wandel said it was too early to tell if the rough weather had
caused both jet engines to lose power.
   ``We have to look at the commonality of both engines (losing
power), so it could be a fuel problem,'' Wandel said.
   J.O. Johnson, an NTSB investigator in Fort Worth, Texas, had
said earlier Wednesday that the plane's engines could have suffered
damage from hail while the jet passed through a storm front along
most of the Gulf Coast region.
   But Wandel said an initial inspection of the engine turbines did
not suggest hail damage as the cause of their failure. He said the
plane had approximately 12,800 pounds of fuel on board, leading
investigators to believe the problem could have been fuel
contamination.
   He also would not rule out the possibility that lightning hit
the plane and said it would be several months before the NTSB
releases a report on a probable cause.
   Examination of the plane could be finished by Friday, Wandel
said, and then officials must decide how to remove it from the
canal bank. He said the plane could either be flown off the grassy
strip or moved by barge along the Intracoastal Waterway to New
Orleans Lakefront Airport.
   Johnson said flying it out would be better.
   ``I suspect they'll probably grade (the strip) down and fly it
out later,'' Johnson said.
   Federal and airline officials have not confirmed the number of
people aboard the plane, but have placed the figure at 36 to 45.
   TACA is based in San Salvador, El Salvador, but has business
offices in New Orleans.
   The pilot, identified as Carlos Dardano, landed the jet on the
narrow strip on the grounds of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Michoud facility in eastern New Orleans after it
twice lost power in both engines.
   The plane was at 11,000 feet when the engines died the first
time; the control tower at New Orleans International diverted the
plane to the U.S. Naval Air Station at suburban Belle Chasse, 15
miles away.
   The pilot then managed to restart both engines, an FAA source
said, and asked for clearance to land at New Orleans International.
   However, the plane's power failed again at about 5,000 feet, and
the pilot was directed to the small, but less congested Lakefront
Airport about six miles away, the FAA source said.
   The pilot responded with two ``Mayday'' messages and began
looking for somewhere else to land, the source said.
   Saidy Duran, 35, a vacationing teacher at the national
university in Costa Rica, said she and other passengers showed
their appreciation for the captain's work with a round of applause
_ ``a big one.''
   Dardano, of San Salvador, has been with TACA about five years,
Messina said, adding ``He's a pretty cool captain. He doesn't get
flustered very easily.''

   A record company executive, a reputed mob
figure and a third man were convicted Wednesday on federal
conspiracy charges in a case authorities called an example of
organized crime influence in the recording industry.
   Morris Levy, president of Roulette Records, and two associates _
Howard Fisher and Dominick Canterino _ were convicted of two counts
each of conspiring to commit extortion.
   They were charged with an attempted shakedown of John LaMonte of
Darby, Pa., who ran a record wholesale company, in a 1985 dispute
over $1.25 million in records and tapes from MCA Records Inc. of
Los Angeles. MCA has not been charged in the case.
   After a three-week trial, the jury deliberated about 4{ hours
over two days before convicting Levy, 60, of New York City; Fisher,
60, the comptroller of Roulette Records; and Canterino, 57, whom
law enforcement officials described as a member of the Genovese
organized crime family.
   Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts.
   Federal Judge Stanley S. Brotman, whose district includes Darby,
scheduled sentencing for July 8. Each defendant faces a maximum
sentence of 40 years in prison.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Repetto said the government won
its case on the merits of hours of taped conversations obtained by
government wiretaps at Levy's office and other locations.
   ``We didn't offer a whole lot beyond the tapes,'' Repetto said.
   After opening statements in the case, Repetto told Brotman the
government would prove that the case involved reputed mob ties.
   ``The organized crime element is there,'' Repetto said.
   FBI documents filed in the case said government agencies
believed Levy, a self-made millionaire, has been involved with
organized crime for 20 years.
   But Brotman ordered prosecutors not to discuss organized crime
connections during the course of the trial.
   Repetto, in a meeting with reporters following the verdict,
declined to comment on whether the jury drew conclusions that
organized crime played a role in the case.
   ``Mr. Canterino did not drop in from Mars,'' said Repetto, who
asked the judge to raise bail on Canterino and Levy from $500,000
to $5 million cash.
   ``It's been reported that Mr. Levy wishes to go to Australia,''
Repetto told the judge while describing Canterino as a high-ranking
member of the conspiracy.
   The judge ordered bail for Canterino and Levy to be raised to $1
million that will be secured by a $15 million farm belonging to
Levy.
   Defense attorneys assured the judge the men would turn in their
passports to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark and would not
apply for new passports.
   ``He isn't going anywhere,'' Levy's attorney, Martin London,
told the judge.
   During the trial, the defense attacked record wholesaler
LaMonte's credibility, calling the man an ex-con with a history of
criminal activity.
   LaMonte, who served 18 months in prison for a 1977 conviction
for bootlegging records, agreed to wear a wiretap while meeting
with the three men over an 18-month period. He did not testify in
this case, however.
   ``LaMonte and his business were the victims of this extortion,''
Repetto said.
   Defense attorneys also alleged through the trial that one of
LaMonte's three partners in record wholesale firm was Gaetano
Vastola, a reputed member of a New Jersey organized crime family.
   Vastola and three co-defendants go on trial this fall before
Brotman on federal rackeetering charges related to the Levy case,
Repetto said.

   Graduation ceremonies at the U.S. Military Academy in West
Point, N.Y., and the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., were both
marked Wednesday by rainy skies and warnings not to underestimate
the Soviets.
   ``It may be cold and blustery out here, but this ceremony will
be a warm and friendly one,'' Rear Adm. Ronald F. Marryott, Naval
Academy superintendent, told the thousands gathered in Navy-Marine
Corps Memorial Stadium to watch graduation exercises for the class
of 1988 as a light rain began to fall.
   The academy's class of 1,041 graduates included 77 women, 46
Hispanics, 38 blacks, 36 Orientals, two native Americans and seven
citizens of six foreign nations.
   Immediately after receiving their diplomas, 855 of the graduates
were sworn in as Navy ensigns nd 174 as Marine Corps 2nd
lieutenants. Five graduates will become 2nd lieutenants in the Air
Force, and the foreign students will return home.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told the graduates that the
United States welcomes signs of change in the Soviet Union but must
remain aware that Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could mask a
resurgence of Soviet military power.
   ``The departure of President Reagan today for the summit
demonstrates a commitment to explore all reasonable avenues to
lessen the tensions that divide us,'' he said.
   If Gorbachev's goal ``is to change Soviet society in a way that
makes it less aggressive in its expansionist policies, then we will
all have gained,'' said Carlucci. ``On the other hand, if the West
heeds the siren call and relaxes its security guard, only to awaken
to a rebirth of Soviet military power, based on a modernized and
technologically advanced industrial base, then we will have made an
enormous miscalculation.''
   Carlucci called Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative,
popularly known as ``Star Wars,'' the first major step in reversing
nuclear military capabilities from an offensive to a defensive
force. He predicted the Navy will play a greater role in the
military's space involvement.
   ``Imaginative thinking is under way,'' he said, ``as can be seen
in proposals to use naval platforms to launch replacement
satellites in the event of a conflict. Thus, the Navy will
unquestionably adapt to the nation's changing defense requirements.
   He also recommended U.S. policy makers ``carefully construct our
security relationship'' with Japan, Korea and China, countries he
predicted would exert greater economic and political influences on
the world in the future.
   At West Point, the U.S. Military Academy graduated its 190th
class, sending 939 new junior officers into the armed forces.
   Vice President George Bush, former Chief Justice Warren Burger
and Lt. Gen. Dave R. Palmer, Weest Point superintendent, handed out
diplomas to 849 men and 90 women in a rain-drenched ceremony at
Michie Stadium.
   In the commencement address, Bush criticized what he called the
``liberal elite'' who, he said, never understood that the Soviet
Union must be dealt with from strength.
   ``They are so blinded by ideology that they cannot see what
Americans have understood for 40 years; that peace flows from
strength,'' the Republican presidential aspirant said in what was
billed as a non-political speech.
   Political campaigning is prohibited at military installations.
   The vice president told the cadets that it was a good thing that
the United States and Soviet Union engaged in summit meetings, but
he said Americans must not become complacent about the Soviet
threat just because the two sides were talking.
   He said the times require leadership that ``will pursue
negotiations with the Soviet realistically.''
   Douglas Fraley, 21, of Irondale, Ohio, was at the top of the
class, finishing with the best academic record and also winning a
Rhodes scholarship. The class boasted a second Rhodes scholar, John
Nagl, 22, of Omaha, Neb.
   The class goat was Michael Klee, 22, of El Paso, Texas. ``Too
much socializing and not enough studying,'' was Klee's explanation
for his finishing at the bottom academically.
   The goat is not formally designated by the academy, and the
identity of the cadet who squeaked through becomes known only
because of the extra-loud cheers when his name is read. He also is
slipped a bag of money collected by classmates relieved at having
escaped his fate.

<HEAD>Senior Official Denies Anti-Americanism is Widespread</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Anti-American sentiment expressed by
radical South Korea students is ``not shared by the mainstream,'' a
senior government official said Wednesday.
   An influential newspaper on Wednesday meanwhile accused the
United States of meddling in South Korean affairs, but opposed
calls for expulsion of U.S. troops.
   Hyun Hong-choo, minister of legislation, said: ``We are
confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations
with the United States.''
   He was commenting at a lunch with the press about a wave of
anti-government and anti-American demonstrations in South Korean
cities in the past week.
   Referring to calls by some radicals for the U.S. Army to
relinquish its operational control of the South Korean army, Hyun
said the government ``feels there should be changes as time
progreses and situations change.''
   The United States has 42,000 troops based in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact. A U.S. general heads the combined military
forces.
   The newspaper Chosun Ilbo said in an editorial that South
Koreans resent ``U.S. interference in domestic politics and economy
in a high-handed manner, its support for dictatorship and coercive
demands to open Korean markets.''
   Radicals contend the United States has supported military rule
in South Korea and encourages the continued division of the Korean
peninsula. The peninsula was divided in 1945 into communist North
Korea and pro-Western South Korea.
   ``The recent anti-U.S. criticism apparently indicates students
and dissidents are mounting a major anti-U.S. campaign aimed at the
removal of U.S. troops,'' Chosun Ilbo said.
   But the newspaper backed the presence of the American troops. It
called on Koreans to maintain critical but balanced views of the
United States instead of blind opposition.
   The editorial's criticism of the United States was quite unusual
for the South Korean press.
   Student protesters claim South Korea is not a democracy, as they
did during the authoritarian regime of President Roh Tae-woo's
predecessor and ally, Chun Doo-hwan.
   Roh was elected last December in South Korea's first direct
elections in 16 years.

<HEAD>Legislator Charges NRA's Power Gutted Seven-Day Waiting Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BIRK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) The lawmaker proposing a statewide
cooling-off period for handgun sales Wednesday withdrew a version
of his bill weakened by legislators he accused of knuckling under
to the National Rifle Association.
   ``I cannot personally allow the bill in its current posture to
come out with my name on it,'' said Rep. Ron Silver, a Democrat
from North Miami Beach.
   ``The National Rifle Association is a very powerful, financially
secure organization and the Legislature is responding more to the
National Rifle Association than to the people of Florida.''
   Silver distributed a memo to the other 119 House members
decrying a Tuesday vote that reduced his proposed weeklong waiting
period to three working days at the option of each county. The
proposed constitutional amendment would have been put to voters in
a November referendum.
   State law already allows counties to enact waiting periods of up
to two days.
   A lobbyist for the NRA dismissed Silver's claims that the
association was improperly influencing lawmakers.
   ``He knows that's not true,'' said Marion Hammer, director of
the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, the NRA's Florida arm. ``There's
no hue and cry out there for waiting periods. ... He only wants to
let the people decide if he can pick the question. Who's fooling
who?''
   Silver said he will mount a petition drive to place the
seven-day question on the ballot anyway, which will require him to
collect several hundred thousand signatures of registered voters
across the state by August.
   If that drive succeeds and voters adopt the constitutional
amendment, Silver said he would push separate legislation to
require gun buyers to sign their intent to purchase weapons. The
current 48-hour waiting period, which several counties have
enacted, has been faulted because it doesn't require written intent
to purchase a weapon.
   Rep. Ron Johnson, who sponsored the amendment to weaken Silver's
proposal as well as last year's controversial law that made it
easier for Floridians to carry concealed weapons, responded to
Silver's memo by telling his colleague, ``I find it personally
offensive.''

   A U.S. negotiating effort to induce Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to go into exile this summer
collapsed Wednesday and no further talks are planned, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz announced.
   ``At the final moment in negotiations, Noriega would not carry
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated,''
Shultz told a hastily-arranged news conference.
   ``No offers remain on the table,'' he said.
   Under Secretary of State Michael Armacost told reporters that
Noriega had indicated that ``majors and captains'' within Panama's
Defense Forces ``might take strong action'' against him if he
agreed to the deal.
   The United States has been seeking Noriega's removal since his
indicment in February by a federal grand jury in Miami on charges
of taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellin
cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money and hide drug
smugglers from law enforcement officials.
   The collapse of the talks came as President Reagan was flying to
Helsinki, Finland on the first leg of his summit meeting in Moscow
next week with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Upon arrival, Reagan was asked at a picture-taking session with
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto whether he felt his hand had been
weakened on the eve of the summit. ``I don't feel weakened,'' he
said.
   Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill welcomed the
development. ``Sending Noriega off into retirement with a legal
golden parachute ... would have been the wrong step at the wrong
time,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   The key provisions of the proposed agreement called for
Noriega's resignation in August as Defense Force commander, his
departure from Panama and, in exchange, the dismissal of U.S. drug
smuggling indictments against him.
   The goal was to remove Noriega from the Panamanian political
scene as the country moved toward civilian-led rule with
presidential elections in May 1989.
   Shultz indicated that the two countries now appear to be back to
square one.
   ``All proposals addressed during these negotiations have been
withdrawn,'' he said.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said in a statement that
Noriega is a ``fugitive'' and the U.S. government will use ``every
legal means at our disposal to bring him to justice, to remove him
from power and to restore democracy to Panama.''
   The U.S. negotiating plan had drawn considerable bipartisan
opposition at home and from anti-Noriega forces in Panama as well.
Among the critics was Democratic presidential front runner Michael
Dukakis.
   Vice President George Bush, in a break with Reagan, said he, if
elected president, would not negotiate with reputed drug dealers,
either domestic and foreign. The Senate approved 86-10 a resolution
criticizing the proposed dismissal of the drug charges against
Noriega.
   Throughout, the State Department view was that dismissal of the
indictments against Noriega was a small price to pay for his
departure from Panama and the restoration of democratic rule.
   The negotiations reached the do-or-die stage starting on Monday
when State Department envoy Michael G. Kozak returned to Panama
after two days of consultations in Washington.
   U.S. officials said Wednesday morning that agreement seemed to
be in hand but Kozak telephoned the department at 4 p.m. EDT to say
that Noriega had rejected the plan.
   Shultz said the administration expects to work with Latin
American democracies in hopes of seeking a solution.
   He said the United States ``will continue to work with the
people of Panama ... to get Noriega out of Panama,'' but he offered
no details of how that might be accomplished.
   He refused comment when asked if military solutions are being
contemplated. But at the Pentagon, officials insisted there were no
plans afoot for direct military intervention in Panama.
   The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, also said the roughly 11,000 American troops in Panama
had not been placed on any special alert.
   Shultz said that Noriega backed away from the proposal when he
saw that ``it got him out of Panama and it got him out of power.''
   Shultz said the United States would continue to recognize ousted
President Arturo Eric Delvalle as the legitimate leader of Panama,
rather than President Manuel Solis Palma, the nominal leader
approved by Noriega.
   In Panama, a pro-government newspaper said Panama's military
rejected the proposed accord because the plan would not guarantee
that Solis Palma remained in power.
   ``The high command of the Defense Forces and the Strategic
Military Council rejected the points of conversation because they
found no guarantee of the continuity of the constitutional mandate
of President Manuel Solis Palma,'' said the pro-government
afternoon daily La Republica, citing unidentified sources.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, who obtained the indictment against
Noriega in Miami, said after Shultz's announcement, ``We are
prepared to go forward with the case and we will do so.''
   Neal Sonnett, one of Noriega's four Miami lawyers, said he
believes the Miami indictment against his client could well be
dismissed.
   ``I have continued to work on our motion for dismissal of the
indictment on legal grounds and we will continue to do so. We still
feel that we have a strong case for dismissal on a variety on
various grounds,'' Sonnett said.
   Shultz had planned to accompany Reagan when he left Washington
Wednesday morning for Helsinki.
   But Shultz stayed behind to monitor the Panama situation,
delaying his departure for Finland until early evening.

   Tom Bird was 19 years old when he first saw
Vietnam in 1965.
   ``This is paradise,'' he remembers saying as he looked down from
an airplane at a pristine beach. ``There can't be a war here.''
   Some 23 years later, the image of that paradise still haunts
him. So do images of the Vietnam War, a conflict he experienced
first hand as a member of the battered First Cavalry Division.
   In ``Walking Point: A Vietnam Voyage,'' now on view at
off-Broadway's Samuel Beckett Theater, Bird tries to reconcile the
two memories. His reconciliation forms the core of ``Walking
Point,'' a harrowing yet hopeful tale of Vietnam that eloquently
tries to explain the hold this strange, wonderous country had _ and
still has _ over the American servicemen who fought there.
   In ``Walking Point,'' Bird, founder and artistic director of the
Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company, sits alone on stage and
talks for some 80 minutes about his visits to Southeast Asia. In
the fervent, almost monotone voice of a true believer, he tells the
audience about three trips he made to Vietnam after the war ended.
   Bird's postwar journeys, including one he made with performance
artist and clown Bill Irwin, become vivid travelogues. He describes
a calm, strangely tranquil Vietnam, no longer divided into North
and South. There's a visit to a water puppet show in Hanoi, a
magical, almost mystical experience that suddenly brings back
horrific memories of the war. And there are profiles of various
guides and interpreters, men who a few years before were part of
the enemy.
   The juxtaposition of past and present never is far from the
surface in any of Bird's stories. They overlap when Bird travels
south to Saigon _ he can't bring himself to call it Ho Chi Minh
City _ to visit places he saw during the war.
   He finds the city alive and vibrant, full of reminders of an
American presence that left abruptly more than a decade ago. There
are the fading signs in English proclaiming U.S. military
installations. There is the burned hulk of an American tank that
sets Bird wondering about who were the soldiers who died in its
wreckage. And there are the Amerasian children, the questioning
faces of the young who bear the unmistakable imprint of America.
   What finally makes the evening such a moving and unsettling
experience is Bird's extraordinary feeling for Vietnam. It embodies
love, hate and just about every emotion in between.
   But ``Walking Point'' never sinks into despair, even though
Bird's story is melancholy and, at times, painfully sad. Maybe
that's because its author won't give up. He's a determined
storyteller who won't stop talking until he understands why it all
happened and what have been consequences of America's attempt to
save Vietnam from communism.

   ``The Wonder Years,'' now playing at off-Broadway's Village
Gate, may be the first musical built entirely on name and product
recognition.
   Virtually every pop icon and every fad from the 1950s and '60s
are mentioned in this mild little revue that examines the baby boom
generation from birth to the year 2018, the 50th anniversary of
Woodstock. They are all here _ from Lucy Riccardo to Mr. _ and Dr.
_ Spock; from hula hoops to the Watusi; from Wally Cleaver to
Polaroid Swingers.
   The music and lyrics by David Levy are as unsurprising as the
cast which is headed by the always cheerful Lenny Wolpe. He plays
an irritating character named Skippy, billed as the first baby-boom
baby, born one minute after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946.
   At least Wolpe is enthusiastic. But ``The Wonder Years'' is as
bland as the white bread it celebrates.

   UNESCO chief Federico Mayor on Wednesday proposed
slashing programs and reining in spending to woo back the United
States and other ex-members, but ran into opposition from Soviet
bloc and Third World nations.
   The director-general said the 158-nation organization faced
``new challenges that required fresh solutions'' and called for
reduction of UNESCO's 16 major programs to five and of its 60
general programs to 16.
   Mayor's plan, officially called a sketch to indicate that it
could be considerably modified, proposed austerity measures aimed
at saving $8 million. It called for shorter conferences, reduced
travel and controls on document production.
   The Paris-based United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization should do fewer things but do them better
``with fewer activities and more follow-up,'' Mayor said, adding
that the agency had to be ``more visible in order to be more
credible.''
   Mayor, elected to head UNESCO in November, outlined the
preliminary plan to members of the 51-nation Executive Board at the
start their three-week-long spring meeting.
   On Monday the Spanish scientist said he was asking the United
States, Britain and Singapore to rejoin UNESCO.
   The United States and Britain, which paid 30 percent of UNESCO's
budget, pulled out in 1984 and 1985 to protest the organization's
alleged anti-Western bias and squandering of resources. The UNESCO
budget was $289.3 million for 1986-87.
   Mayor had described his proposals as ``provocative'' and likely
to stimulate a major debate at UNESCO.
   In fact, some members found them so disturbing that the agenda
was changed at the last minute so that Mayor could present his plan
at the opening session instead of Monday of next week as scheduled.
   The Group of 77 Third World countries circulated a paper sharply
critical of the plan, which they said treated them as ``objects for
whose benefits activities have been proposed rather than as actors
and equal partners.''
   It said the proposals do not reflect the wishes of the member
states and should be re-drafted and presented at the board's 1989
spring meeting.
   Another indication of the tough sledding Mayor's plan will face
came from Indian delegate Swaran Singh.
   He said the document contained contradictions and that it dealt
in terms of concepts and not real problems and played down the role
of governments.
   Singh called for restoration of one of the dropped programs that
deals with peace and development, and the struggle for human rights
and against discrimination.
   Polish delegate Kazimiierz Zygulski said there was an
``obsession with change and efficiency'' in Mayor's proposals. ``We
can't be just a pragmatic organization, we have to have specific
goals,'' he said.
   In opening the meeting, Board President Jose Israel Vargas of
Brazil praised the ``orginality, freshness and broadness of view''
in Mayor's proposals.
   Mayor said the agency should concentrate on five major areas:
education, natural science, culture, communications and social
science.
   He has promised to consult intellectuals, artists, scientists,
educators and journalists before preparing a final version of the
plan.
   During his presentation, Mayor made no reference to UNESCO's
controversial plan to establish a new world information and
communication order, which has been sharply criticized by Western
governments and news media organizations.
   In speeches to media professionals last week in Rome and
Istanbul, Turkey, Mayor said he favored a ``new phase'' at UNESCO
that would allow a ``free and uninhibited flow of information.''

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen thought to be Sikh radicals killed
eight people in Punjab on Wednesday, Indian news agencies reported.
   The shootings occurred in Amritsar, Jalandhar and the Ropar
district of Punjab and raised to at least 1,171 the number of
people killed by extremists in the northern Indian state since the
year began. The toll for all of 1987 was 1,030 killed.
   Police meanwhile reported that municipal workers recovered human
skeletons Wednesday from Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden
Temple.
   The Amritsar city police superintendent, Baldev Singh, said two
skeletons, of a man and a woman, were pulled from under the debris
inside the temple complex by city laborers.
   ``These are the remains of people tortured and then killed by
Sikh terrorists,'' Singh told The Associated Press.
   ``There are more such skeletons, we are trying to bring them
out.''
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982. Singh said the radicals
often tortured people they suspected to be police informers.
   Police and paramilitary forces surround the Golden Temple, where
a 10-day siege ended last week after militants inside were forced
to surrender. The temple was opened to the public for the first
time Monday.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority in
Punjab. Hindus account for more than 80 percent of India's
population.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aldermen in the nation's third-largest city
approved an ordinance Wednesday that sponsors said would bar
smoking in most public areas and force restaurant owners and
employers to set aside smoking sections.
   New York and Los Angeles, the first and second-largest cities,
already have smoking restrictions.
   ``Those of you who want to die _ do it yourselves,'' declared
Anna Langford, one of 33 City Council members who voted for the
ordinance. Eight voted against it.
   ``Law enforcement officials would be better placed trying to
chase criminals than smokers,'' said Alderman Edward Burke in
speaking against the ordinance, whose quick passage surprised even
some supporters.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, a smoker, favors the ban, said aide Monroe
Anderson.
   ``We thought the vote was going to be closer, and he was
prepared to break the tie and vote for it. The mayor smokes, but he
has cut back dramatically. He never smokes in public,'' Anderson
said.
   The ordinance bans smoking entirely in enclosed public areas
like meeting rooms and taxicabs and requires restaurants with 40
seats or more to set aside smoking and non-smoking areas, said
Alderman Raymond Figueroa, the ordinance's main sponsor. He said
the amount of designated restaurant space would be based on the
percentage of smoking and non-smoking clientele.
   Bars and private meeting rooms would be exempt from the ban.
   In addition, Figueroa said, employers must designate smoking and
no-smoking areas if workers request them. No-smoking signs must be
posted in all designated areas, he said.
   The ordinance, which takes effect in 60 days, carries fines
ranging from $25 to $100.
   ``Chicago has to line up with the rest of the major cities. We
have been lagging,'' Figueroa said.
   A state House committee blocked legislation in late April to
restrict smoking in most public places in Illinois, even though the
proposal had been watered down to appease business groups. Similar
legislation has been introduced annually in recent years without
success.
   Los Angeles' smoking ban, the city's fifth anti-smoking
legislation since 1964, went into effect in January. It bans
smoking in indoor sports arenas, concert halls, stores not
specializing in tobacco products, transportation terminals, day
care centers and most private schools. Restaurants seating more
than 50 would be required to reserve more than half their seats for
non-smokers.
   New York's anti-smoking law, one of the toughest in the nation,
went into effect last month. Although small establishments are
exempt, the bill forbids smoking inside sports arenas, theaters,
banks, hospitals and taxis. It limits smoking in offices,
restaurants and hotel lobbies. Smoking has been limited in all city
buildings since June 1986.
   When the New York legislation passed, health officials said
about 150 cities had enacted some kind of smoking restriction
legislation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday opened another
front in a U.S. effort to boost sales of American oranges and
orange juice in Japan.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced that he has
accepted a Florida citrus industry petition for a formal
investigation of Japanese restrictions on orange and juice imports
as unfair trade practices.
   The restrictions include import quotas and a requirement that
imported juice be blended with home-grown juice.
   Yeutter's office already is pursuing the orange dispute at other
levels. After months of unsuccessful negotiations with the Japanese
government, it moved earlier this month to have the Japanese orange
import quotas _ along with those on beef imports _ declared illegal
under international trading rules by GATT, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   Any of the cases could culminate in formal U.S. retaliation
against Japanese products or official demands for compensation for
lost sales.
   Yeutter said in a statement the United States already ``is
aggressively moving on two different fronts ... to resolve the
citrus and beef disputes'' with Japan.
   ``In the coming weeks we will vigorously pursue our GATT case,''
he said, while at the same time making additional efforts to
resolve the dispute directly with Tokyo, where a U.S. delegation
has been meeting with Japanese agriculture ministry officials.
   ``If those efforts do not lead to a satisfactory resolution of
the matter, or if Japan obstructs the GATT process, the U.S. could
retaliate against any violation by Japan of its GATT obligations,
or any unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory Japanese government
practice that limits access to its citrus market,'' Yeutter added.
   The Florida citrus industry, which petitioned May 6 to get the
Japanese restrictions declared unfair, contends that lifting them
would cut by one-third the prices Japanese consumers must pay for
oranges, Yeutter noted.
   Yeutter's office had 45 days to decide whether to accept the
industry petition for an investigation but it took only 19 days. If
the office finds that unfair practices do exist and the dispute
cannot be resolved through negotiations or the GATT machinery, it
recommends action to the president.
   The petition was filed under Section 301 of the 1974 trade act
which also authorizes investigations on the government's own
initiative.
   Organizations joining in the Florida petition were the Florida
Citrus Mutual, the Florida Citrus Packers, the Florida Citrus
Processors Association, the Florida Department of Citrus and the
Indian River Citrus League.
   Elimination of the barriers, they said, could boost annual U.S.
exports to Japan to 300,000 metric tons, compared with 1987 sales
of 126,000 tons of fresh oranges and 8,500 tons of juice.
   Japan buys more American farm products than any other country
but disagreement continued in still another foodstuff trade
conflict.
   Japanese Agriculture Ministry official Hirohumi Ueno ended two
days of talks with Yeutter's office Wednesday without formally
announced results on implementation of GATT findings earlier this
year that Japanese import quotas on 10 varieties of canned or
processed foods were illegal.
   The Japanese Embassy said Ueno would return to Japan and the
talks would continue at a date not yet fixed.
   During the exchange, the U.S. side demanded total removal of the
quotas within two years while Japan proposed a slower
liberalization program, the embassy indicated, without giving
specific details. The U.S. side also urged Japan against measures
that could nullify removal of the quotas, such as import
surcharges, the embassy said.
   There was no immediate comment from the U.S. side, led by Susan
Early, assistant trade representative for agriculture.
   Affected U.S. exports include preserved, concentrated or
sweetened milk and cream, processed cheese, preserved beef and
pork, fruit purees, pastes, pulps and juices, tomato ketchup and
sauce, starch, sugar, dried leguminous vegetables and ground nuts.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels arrived in Managua late Wednesday for a new round of talks
with the leftist government on reaching a permanent cease-fire in
the 6-year-old war.
   The negotiations were expected to begin Thursday.
   One group of negotiators for the rebels, known as Contras,
arrived in Managua from the Costa Rican capital of San Jose.
   ``We come with great political will so that a permanent solution
will be arrived at to (resolve) the situation in Nicaragua,''
Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros told the Sandinista government's
Voice of Nicaragua radio station.
   A few hours later, Col. Enrique Bermudez, the rebel military
leader, arrived on a private plane from the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa. He was accompanied by Alfredo Cesar, head of the rebel
delegation, and other Contra officials.
   The two dozen rebel delegates went immediately to the Camino
Real Hotel near the international airport on the outskirts of the
capital.
   Matamoros said the first known visit of Bermudez to Managua
during the war underlines the Contras' ``political will to search
for a Nicaraguan solution to the war.''
   Contra leaders initially refused to return to the capital,
complaining that their movements were restricted in two previous
sessions this year.
   Roberto Ferrey, secretary of the Nicaraguan Resistance, said
representatives of the Contra umbrella organization were going to
Managua ``with the understanding that there will be complete and
unrestricted freedom of expression and the free right to meet with
organizations and leaders.''
   He spoke by telephone with The Associated Press from San Jose.
   The government said Tuesday it would allow the rebels to meet
with the most important opposition group in the country, the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, and to visit the Roman Catholic
bishops' conference, the opposition daily La Prensa and relatives.
   President Daniel Ortega rejected Contra demands the talks take
place in the border post of Sapoa, where the two sides agreed to
the 60-day truce scheduled to expire May 30.
   In Washington, Wilson Morris, an aide to House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said the rebels planned to offer to lay down their
arms on Sept. 1.
   Ortega said on Monday he was unilaterally extending the
temporary truce for an additional 30 days.
   Rebel leaders have rejected extensions of the truce, but members
of the political directorate said in Washington they would not
break the truce even after May 30.
   A major obstacle to agreement has been the issue of delivery of
non-lethal aid to the rebels gathered in cease-fire zones inside
Nicaragua.
   Under the Sapoa agreement, the aid was to come through a neutral
international organization. Contras insisted in the talks that they
had the right to choose the organization.
   Contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a
proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside
Nicaragua by an agency with ties to the Organization of American
States.
   Cesar said in Washington that the rebels would propose a
timetable for political changes that include a free and fair
electoral system, an independent judiciary with the power to
guarantee human rights, removal of the military from Sandinista
party control, and guaranteed property rights.
   The pro-government newspaper Nuevo Diario said Wednesday the
government sent the National Assembly a bill providing for direct
elections of city councils in Nicaraguan municipalities, includng
Managua, late this year or early next year.
   Mayors, who now are named by the executive branch, would be
chosen from the city councils, it said.
   Maria Elena Martinez, an assembly spokeswoman, said the bill was
not yet available to the news media.
   The constitution provides for election of municipal governments
through ``direct, free and secret'' balloting.
   Ortega says the war has killed 26,500 people and caused $3
billion in damage to the economy.

   Medical tests showed former Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos did not suffer a heart attack, and the
Philippine consul Wednesday accused the hospitalized Marcos of
faking chest pains to gain sympathy in his homeland.
   ``I think these are charades, these chest pains are not
substantiated medically,'' Tomas Gomez, the consul here, said. ``We
are faced with a master manipulator.''
   Marcos' physician, Dr. Derek Pang, ruled out a heart attack as
the cause of the discomfort and ordered Marcos to undergo tests
Thursday for a possible lung ailment, said Marcos spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad.
   ``He's in high spirits, but will have to have additional tests
to determine the cause of the pain,'' Trinidad said.
   Marcos, 70, was listed in guarded condition Wednesday in the
intensive care unit after being admitted Tuesday night, St. Francis
Medical Center spokeswoman Cheryl Yoshina said.
   Marcos began suffering chest pains Tuesday before an hour-long
interview with Allen Neuharth, chairman of the Gannett newspaper
group, according to Arturo Aruiza, Marcos' chief spokesman. After
consulting his personal physician, Dr. Derek Pang, Marcos was
admitted to the hospital, Aruiza said.
   Marcos admitted during the interview that his health was poor, a
rare statement for the former president who has often denied
earlier reports of ill health.
   Gomez said Marcos' hospitalization was a ploy to gain support in
the Philippines for his bid to return home.
   ``He went to the hospital voluntarily, under his own steam,''
Gomez said. ``We know what he's up to.''
   The hospital would release no specific information about Marcos'
condition except that he would be hospitalized at least until
Thursday.
   Gomez would not speculate on whether Marcos would be allowed to
return to the Philippines, but, in Manila, several politicians said
he should be allowed to come home.
   ``This is going to create another problem if (Marcos) comes home
in a box,'' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda. ``Now is the time for the
government to act and allow him to return.''
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow Marcos
to return for the funeral of his mother, who died May 4 and awaits
burial. Aquino said Marcos poses a threat to national security.
   The hospital's intensive care unit section was guarded closely
by Marcos security guards, who also manned every entrance to the
hospital.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, spent most of the night with her husband,
according to spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, but she made no statement to
the news media.
   Marcos and his wife have lived here since fleeing the
Philippines during the February 1986 civilian-military revolution
toppled him after 20 years in power.

   Placido Domingo led New York's Metropolitan Opera
to a thunderous welcome from Japanese fans Wednesday as the Met
opened its Japan tour with Domingo in the leading role in ``The
Tales of Hoffman.''
   The Spanish tenor's impassioned interpretation of a poet who
relates three love fantasies, one each act brought him eight
curtain calls and roaring approval from an audience that included
Crown Prince Akihito, his wife Princess Michiko and son Prince Hiro.
   With ``Hoffman,'' the Met began its second tour of Japan and
only its fourth tour outside North America. Mozart's ``The Marriage
of Figaro,'' featuring sopranos Kathleen Battle and Hong Hei-kyung
as Susanna and bass-baritone John Cheek as Figaro, opens Friday.
The Met is also performing Verdi's ``Il Travatore.''
   Wednesday's four-hour performance in the 3,450-seat NHK Hall was
punctuated by applause and shouts of approval after each aria, duet
or trio. By the fourth curtain call, most of the audience was on
its feet.
   Applause continued for 11 minutes after the final curtain.
Hundreds in the audience surged toward the front of the stage,
tossing small bouquets to the 47-year-old Domingo and Erie Mills,
Martine Dupuy and Roberta Alexander, who played Hoffman's three
loves.
   Domingo picked up the flowers, handing some to the three female
singers and tossing some to the orchestra pit and the audience.
   The audience also applauded wildly for bass James Morris, who
lustily sang four roles throughout the three acts and prologue and
epilogue, and artistic director James Levine, who conducted the
Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
   Joining the imperial family on opening night were business and
cultural luminaries, including the Sony Corp. chairman, Akio
Morita; novelist Yukiko Kato and veteran actor Osamu Takizawa.
   ``Domingo's high notes really extended far. He was lovely,''
said Miss Kato. ``As a writer, I think the story of `Hoffman' is
captivating, and that's why I particularly wanted to see it.''
   The New York company's performance ``was wonderful,'' said
Takizawa, 81. ```Figaro' is probably the best known opera in Japan,
but I've seen it done by other troupes. This is my first time to
see the Met, and I'm delighted.''
   For opera devotees who didn't understand the French lyrics, a
Japanese translation was projected onto a narrow screen above the
stage.
   ``If you knew the story slightly, you didn't need to read the
screen,'' Miss Kato said. ``In fact I think it's better not to.''
   While the cheers were clearly heartfelt, the promoter, Japan
Arts Corp., did what it could to encourage them. In a series of
three newsletters sent to those who had purchased advance tickets,
opera lovers were urged to add to the crescendo of bravos _ and not
to boo.

   A flight mechanic stole a private Learjet from
Virginia on Wednesday and took it on a 1,600-mile joyride to
Denver, where he killed himself as authorities approached the
plane, officials said.
   Mike Christiansen, 24, who was not a licensed pilot, was found
dead at the controls of the twin-engine plane, a Learjet 36a,
moments after a pilot he knew talked him through a relatively
routine landing at Stapleton International Airport at 5:18 a.m.,
authorities said.
   The pilot, Bob Cunningham, said he was not nervous in talking
Christiansen down, ``because I was confident he was going to listen
to me.''
   Police, FBI agents and emergency personnel were waiting at the
edge of the runway with their lights off when Christiansen landed
the plane, five hours after stealing the 10-seat plane from Patrick
Henry International Airport in Newport News, Va.
   Christiansen, of Newport News, worked as a flight mechanic at
the airport for Atlanta-based Flight International, which owned the
plane and operates the world's largest fleet of Learjets, officials
said.
   ``As the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached, he
was ordered to lock his brakes,'' said Stapleton spokesman Richard
Boulware. ``They heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit,
they found him dead. Things happened really fast.''
   Denver FBI spokesman Dick Schussler said the agency knew little
about Christiansen. Gordon James, executive vice president of
Flight International, would only confirm he had been employed
there. The Associated Press made 30 calls to the apartment complex
where he lived and found only one resident at home. She said she
never had heard of him.
   Authorities said they do not know why Christiansen, who was
alone in the plane, killed himself or where he got the gun. The FBI
and Federal Aviation Administration were investigating.
   No motive for the plane theft was given, although Boulware said,
``The indication was that he just wanted to fly around for awhile.''
   ``This guy obviously was a proficient pilot,'' said Boulware.
``He made a good landing right in the middle of the runway with no
damage to the plane or the runway. The very fact that he got off
the ground shows that he knew something.''
   Pete Daikos, spokesman for Patrick Henry airport, said
Christiansen did not have a pilot's license and had been employed
with Flight International since March.
   As the plane was taking off around 2:15 a.m. EDT, it clipped a
security guard's van on a runway, shearing off part of a wingtip
fuel tank and damaging the driver's side of the van, said Daikos.
The guard escaped injury because he had gotten out of the van
moments earlier, Daikos said.
   The plane apparently was airborne for the next five hours,
although FAA officials in Denver said they did not know
Christiansen's whereabouts until he was detected over western
Kansas.
   Controllers at several airports had tracked the plane during
parts of its flight, said Dick Stafford, an FAA spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
   Frank Johns, senior FAA official at the Stapleton tower, said
the FAA contacted International Jet Aviation Services in Englewood
and asked whether a Learjet pilot was available to help
Christiansen land the plane.
   In the meantime, the FAA rerouted some flights along
Christiansen's projected flight path, and Stapleton officials
cleared runways.
   Cunningham, an International Jet Aviation pilot, talked
Christiansen through the landing. The FAA played a 19-minute tape
recording of their conversation, which dealt exclusively with
altitude, airspeed and other technical adjustments Christiansen was
asked to make before setting the plane down.
   In a news conference Wednesday evening, he said he quickly
recognized the voice on the radio as Christiansen, a former
employee of his own company whom he recalled as a ``very personable
man.''
   ``He did his job well. I never had any problems with him,'' he
said, adding that he did not find out that Christiansen had
committed suicide until 10 minutes after the landing.
   ``I was shocked to get that news, and I though it was very
tragic,'' he said.
   After Christiansen landed, Cunningham asked, ``Are you OK, Mike?
Mike, are you OK? Have you got that thing shut down yet?'' There
was no reply, and Boulware said Christiansen was found dead moments
later.
   Vern Alexander, a spokesman for Learjet in Tucson, Ariz., said
the Learjet 36a has a range of 2,568 miles and a cruising speed of
over 500 mph. A standard-equipped model, which sells for $4.25
million, seats 10 passengers and a crew of two.

<TEXT>
   After six years and a dozen Emmy Awards, NBC's
unconventional hospital show ``St. Elsewhere'' left the air
Wednesday night after a final scene that may have perplexed many
viewers.
   In a maniacal twist on the ``it-was-all-a-dream'' plot that
``Dallas'' made famous, the final scene revealed that the entire
series had never existed, except in the mind of the autistic son of
one of the doctors, Westphall.
   Up until the surprise ending, the final episode, titled ``The
Last One,'' seemed a basic end-of-series sendoff. In view of the
show's irreverent philosophy, perhaps it was, in fact, an obscure
satire on final episodes.
   ``I expect a very mixed reaction (to the ending),'' said Bruce
Paltrow, one of the show's executive producers. ``I think some
people will think it's extraordinary and existential and
quintessential `St. Elsewhere.' I think other people will find it
puzzling, odd, maybe unfulfilling in some way. I think we'll get a
broad range of responses, those being the poles.''
   When it made its debut six season ago, the show was part of a
wave of creativity, mainly from MTM Productions, that
revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s. ``St.
Elsewhere'' followed the MTM series ``Hill Street Blues'' onto NBC
and was inevitably compared to the earlier show's groundbreaking
style _ quick cuts, subplots, overlapping dialogue and hand-held
cameras.
   But ``St. Elsewhere'' went beyond ``Hill Street,'' a police
show, in social satire, even making fun of its own network and
previous MTM shows.
   The ``St. Elsewhere'' writers had wanted to go all out in the
final episode, but prohibitive costs kept their script, a
futuristic view of St. Eligius hospital at the edge of apocalypse,
from being filmed.
   Set in the year 2013, it depicted the St. Eligius doctors, as
well as some now-practicing offspring, waiting for a huge cloud of
toxic gas released in a war between ``U.S. Inc.'' and ``Corporate
Africa.'' The script revealed that Fox and NBC are the only two TV
networks of the future, and that Ed McMahon will become a major
cultural figure.
   In the end, prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended
final episode but the show itself. ``St. Elsewhere'' was produced
at a loss by MTM at a time when hour-long series are not selling
well in syndication.
   The show has been sold in syndication, though MTM will release
no details. In an apparently personal, inside joke in the dialogue
of the final script, Dr. Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel), says of his
years at St. Eligius, ``Grueling hours, bad food, egomania, death
and moral confusion. It'll be hard to leave.''
   The producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a
new series for NBC, ``Tattinger's,'' an offbeat romantic comedy set
in a popular New York restaurant. It is being shot on location here
and stars Stephen Collins, Blythe Danner and Jerry Stiller. The
show is on NBC's fall schedule in the same time period that ``St.
Elsewhere'' is leaving.

   Honduran soldiers battled leftist
Salvadoran guerrillas near the border between the two countries,
leaving 17 rebels dead and three soldiers seriously wounded,
military sources said Wednesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
fighting occurred early Tuesday on the outskirts of Marcala, about
90 miles northwest of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa and 40
miles from the Salvadoran border.
   Since the incident, Honduran air force helicopters have flown
over the area to discourage further fighting, the sources said.
   No further details were available.
   On Saturday, the armed forces said there were intelligence
reports that guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front were planning to carry out terrorist actions in an effort to
destabilize Honduras, a strong U.S. ally in Central America.
   The front, made up of five guerrilla armies, has been fighting
the U.S.-supported government in El Salvador for more than eight
years.
   The armed forces said a rebel unit entered Honduras late last
week to try to take advantage of anti-American sentiment stirred by
the arrest and deportation to the United States of Juan Ramon
Matta, a suspected drug trafficker.
   The Honduran Constitution forbids the extradition of Honduran
citizens.
   In early April, demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate in
Tegucigalpa.

   Firefighters opened a vent on a blazing,
overturned propane tanker Wednesday to try to speed up the burning
of a fire that closed two highways and a commuter rail line for a
second day, officials said.
   Some 500 families remained evacuated Wednesday, police said.
   A vent atop the truck, normally used to let air out as the
tanker is filled, was opened on the firefighters' third attempt to
increase the flow of fuel without setting off an explosion.
   Officials said they couldn't predict how long the fire would
burn because they didn't know how large the rupture was or how much
opening the valve helped. The blaze started when the tanker
overturned at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   Fire Chief Raymond Kuhner said earlier Wednesday although the
``accelerated burn'' method was risky, it was no riskier than
letting the blaze continue. The 2,500-gallon tank could have burned
up to eight days if the flow had not been increased, he said.
   The Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway and the Sunrise Highway
remained closed for a second day, forcing thousands of motorists to
find alternate routes to New York.
   The Long Island Rail Road said 30,000 rail commuters were
directly affected by the closing of several stations on a branch
line, although extra trains were added to the main line.
   The threat of an explosion caused officials to evacuate homes
within a half-mile radius around the tanker, said Nassau County
Executive Thomas Gulotta. Police said 500 households were affected,
revising Tuesday's figure of 2,000 families. About 300 evacuees
spent the night at Seaford Middle School.
   Firefighters kept firetrucks spewing water on the fire to
control it even as they tried to open valves to increase the
propane flow.
   The first valve attempted was found to be melted shut. They then
tried to install a ``belly valve'' that would allow a controlled
flow, but that also failed. Finally, in late afternoon they opened
the vent and hoped propane would trickle out.
   Fire communications supervisor Douglas Wood said the fire
marshal's office and hazardous materials experts were at the scene,
and ambulances were standing by in case of an explosion.
   County police Lt. Willard Krausch said the truck _ owned by
Conservative Gas Co. of Hyde Park _ overturned on the expressway
Tuesday morning when the driver experienced a problem with the
truck's rear wheels.
   The driver, identified by police as Roger Vai, 35, of Westbury,
and a passenger escaped before the truck ignited.
   Vai, who was treated at the scene for a shoulder cut, was
arrested on an outstanding traffic offense and was charged with
driving with a suspended license and failure to produce a license.
He was released on $100 bail.
   Propane such as that carried on the truck meets a variety of
residential and commercial energy needs, particularly in areas not
served by natural gas.

   Senate backers of a major trade bill are
expecting an uphill battle to find enough votes to override
President Reagan's veto, in striking contrast to the quick and
overwhelming House vote to reverse the president's action.
   ``We have to have another three votes at this point and I don't
know where they are going to come from,'' said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a chief sponsor of the
1,000-page trade measure.
   The Senate is expected to take up the legislation after it
returns from the Memorial Day recess.
   Reagan's veto of the legislation on Tuesday came as no surprise.
He has been critical in numerous speeches of a provision that would
require companies to give employees 60 days notice of plant
closings and large-scale layoffs. He has said that businesses need
flexibility to survive hard times.

   Doctors reported finding the first tentative
evidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer,
the nation's leading cancer killer.
   Four studies presented at a medical conference produce at least
a hint that platinum-based drugs, combined with radiation and
sometimes surgery, may help prolong patients' survival.
   None of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lung
cancer, but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a disease
in which survival is measured in months, rather than years.

   ``As the pilot said, `By the grace of God, I got this sucker on

   North Korean terrorism poses an
``extraordinary potential threat'' to the 1988 Summer Olympics, but
security forces are prepared to prevent outbreaks of violence that
might mar the games, a high-ranking State Department official said.
   Even if the Olympics weren't being held in Seoul, South Korea,
there would still be worries about Sikh terrorism, Armenian
terrorists, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Irish
Republican Army, the Japanese Red Army and the Italian Red
Brigades, Undersecretary of State Edward J. Derwinski said in an

   Derwinski, who has been representing the United States in

decision to keep Cuba out of the games reflects the Cuban leader's
``screwed up'' sense of priorities.

<HEAD>Andy Garcia Attracted To Role of Small-Time Bird Smuggler</HEAD>

   Cable viewers can catch a couple of hot stars
from the big screen in a new HBO movie: Ellen Barkin from ``The Big
Easy'' and Andy Garcia, who went from virtual unknown to star of a
box-office smash, ``The Untouchables.''
   In ``Clinton and Nadine,'' Garcia plays a down-on-his-luck
smuggler of exotic birds who gets mixed up in a plot to run guns
for the Contras. The movie premieres Saturday.
   Garcia was born in Cuba, but his family fled as political
refugees in 1961 and settled in Miami Beach.
   ``Clinton and Nadine'' was shot on location in Florida.
   ``I've been here (Los Angeles) for 10 years, but I still like
Miami better because of the weather,'' Garcia said. ``It's closer
to the Caribbean. The downfall for me (here) is the smog. I like
the feeling of tropical weather. I like a tropical night with the
breeze off the ocean. The Caribbean is in my blood.
   ``I was only 5 when I left Cuba, so I'm obsessed with it. I've
built my own memory of it that's greater than what it was.''
   ``Clinton and Nadine'' also stars 1988 Oscar nominee Morgan
Freeman (``Street Smart'') as a slick Miami lawyer who is part of
the scheme to raise money for the Contras.
   Garcia plays Clinton Dillard, a small-time smuggler who is
quitting the business when he discovers that his lawyer-brother has
been murdered. A key to the murder is a cassette tape, which he
finds in a woman's purse. The purse belongs to Nadine Powers, a
high-class hooker with a baby and a dream of living an idyllic life
in Canada.
   The two are quickly swept up and find themselves in Costa Rica _
in a lot of trouble.
   ``The key for me was that Jerry Schatzberg was directing,'' said
Garcia. ``He'd directed `Scarecrow' and `Panic in Needle Park.' I
met him in New York, and when he told me he was talking to Ellen
Barkin and Morgan Freeman, that was the icing on the cake.''
   The Costa Rican scenes were shot on a 30-acre estate in Fort
Lauderdale. ``It was filled with monkeys and they became quite a
sound problem,'' Garcia said. ``Every morning the owners would come
out on the balcony and feed them. Some became quite aggressive, and
one day they attacked the person I was sitting with.''
   Garcia also recently co-starred in ``Stand and Deliver,'' a true
story about a crusading teacher, played by Edward James Olmos. He
said another reason he liked the role of Clinton was the chance to
play a non-minority character. Clinton is from Oklahoma.
   ``I've played a lot of ethnic characers, using Spanish or
Italian,'' he said. ``Clinton's life was in limbo. He'd been an
athlete. I could tell he was in the line of business he was in and
spending his time in Mexico to alienate himself from the baseball
world. It was painful, he wanted to be a loner. In Nadine, he found
a woman going through the same alienation.
   ``I was a jock myself, except for me it was basketball. But that
didn't pan out and I was in limbo. My interest in the arts sort of
took over. After my first college play, it sort of took over. I
think there's a geat parallel between sports and acting, especially
basketball, which is very spontaneous. You have the thrill of the
unknown.''
   Garcia's other credits include ``Eight Million Ways To Die'' and
``The Mean Season.'' His next film is ``The Sixth Family,'' which
will be filmed in Chicago with Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Grey. But
shooting has been delayed by the Writers Guild of America strike.
   After ``The Untouchables,'' in which he played George Stone, one
of the agents recruited by Eliot Ness, Garcia went to London for a
small film called ``American Roulette.''
   ``You can't imagine the ramifications of a successful film like
`The Untouchables,''' he said. ``It helps you get more work. Your
choices are enhanced. I know actors who go their whole lives
without a successful film.''

<HEAD>Church Kids Shower Soviet Children With Fond Birthday Wishes</HEAD>

   Through their churches, American kids are
sending a colorful stream of good wishes to their counterparts in
the Soviet Union as it marks the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity there.
   ``I love you,'' many of the youngsters scrawl on their
hand-fashioned cards, decorated with brightly hued figures. ``Let's
be friends ... Write to me.''
   Called a child-to-child ``crayon brigade,'' about 40,000 cards
have been received by the National Council of Churches for relay to
children of Soviet church members.
   The cards are being carried personally in batches by church
groups visiting Soviet churches this year. Groups went in April and
May and others go in July, August, September and October.
   Additionally, many Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox leaders from this country and elsewhere are to be there
for special celebrations June 5-16.
   But it was the outpouring of fond, joyful artwork by children in
more than 3,000 Sunday school classes in about 60 denominations
that provided the sentimental touch.
   ``It was an overflowing of children's naturalness,'' says
Suzanne Nagel, a New York Episcopalian who originated the project,
asking churches across the country to send cards made by youngsters.
   She says some include photos of themselves and families, and
adds, ``These are really meaningful. They're personalized, so the
receiving Soviet child can say, `See, my American friend has brown
hair.'''
   Many of the cards, which have come from children in all 50
states, are decorated with crosses, hearts, flags, birthday cakes,
balloons, trees, flowers and smiling faces.
   Besides wishing ``happy birthday,'' many cards include
expressions of affection and cheering hopes.
   There also are typical childish misspellings, such as ``Habbi
l000'' and ``prays the Lord.''
   ``We want to be friends with our brothers and sisters in Christ
in the U.S.S.R. and we send these handmade birthday cards as tokens
of friendship,'' wrote the treacher of a Denver Sunday school class.
   When some of the cards were being distributed to Soviet children
at a church in Kiev, ``mothers had tears in their eyes,'' says the
Rev. John Lindner, who led a U.S. tour group there in April.
   The cards range from simple to elaborate, many with words and
pictures in crayon colors, others done with magic markers or
watercolors. Some children sent posters decorated by the whole
class, others cloth banners.
   Ms. Nagel says the project ``breaks down hate'' and ``lessens
fear'' between Soviet and American children and ``helps us to see
our mutual Christianity.
   ``So much of the hate on both sides is manufactured, and our
children are afraid. Each child that sits and scribbles away will
feel less threatened.''
   The overwhelming response to the project was generated in part
by an article about it in the March 1988 issue of Guideposts, an
interdenominational magazine published by the Rev. Norman Vincent
Peale.
   Kathy Todd, coordinator of the ecumenical travel seminars to the
Soviet, says the response has been a ``touching and dramatic
demonstration of an openness to and interest in Soviet Christians.
   ``The cards are, for the most part, coming from ordinary
Christians all over America, in fact from the people most often
thought of as patriotic and anti-Soviet.
   ``This flow of good will toward their brothers and sisters in
the Soviet Union shows the strong desire on the part of many
Americans to get involved and to know each other better.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the reform-minded son of a
southern Russian peasant, is redefining what the world expects from
the Soviet Union and from the man who leads it.
   This 57-year-old law school graduate and career communist has
turned a half-century of Soviet economic orthodoxy on its head by
praising individual enterprise and profitability, and relaxing
bureaucratic controls on managers and workers alike.
   Unlike his predecessors, this Kremlin leader preaches his
reformist brand of socialism with a mix of fiery conviction and
Madison Avenue flare. Whether he is facing foreign journalists
questioning him about human rights, bantering with peasants on a
collective farm or inviting American schoolchildren to the Kremlin,
Gorbachev seems at home with himself and his role as general
secretary of the Communist Party.
   He says he seeks a new working relationship with the United
States and the West that will decrease global tensions and allow
the Soviet Union to turn more resources from the military sector to
developing the country's stagnant civilian economy.
   When he greets President Reagan on Sunday for their fourth
summit meeting, Gorbachev will be hoping to further his own
domestic agenda as well as foreign policy goals, such as a 50
percent cut in strategic nuclear arms.
   Soviet foreign policy, he has said, ``is more than ever
determined by domestic policy, by our interest in concentrating on
constructive endeavors to improve our country. This is why we need
lasting peace, predictability and constructiveness in international
relations.''
   Since March 1985, when he became Soviet leader, Gorbachev's
achievements in the foreign policy field have been far more
tangible than progress in the titanic task he has set for himself
in reviving his country's economy and modernizing its social
structure.
   At the Washington summit last December, Gorbachev and Reagan
signed a treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles, the first
superpower pact in history that mandates the scrapping of an entire
category of weapons.
   On May 15, the first units of a Soviet force estimated at
115,000 troops returned home from Afghanistan. The Soviet military
intervention in support of a socialist regime in that neighboring
country had been an irritant in U.S.-Soviet relations for more than
eight years.
   At home, Gorbachev is pursuing reforms that dismantle much of
the top-heavy bureaucracy that has micromanaged the Soviet economy
since the reign of dictator Josef V. Stalin. This renunciation of
long-standing socialist orthodoxy, plus the Kremlin's ``glasnost''
campaign for more openness and criticism, has left many Soviets
bewildered.
   ``Some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these
processes under way,'' Gorbachev acknowledged earlier this month.
``Some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked.''
   Gorbachev can be charming or tough, philosophical or
down-to-earth, solemn or jovial. But his message to his countrymen
is usually the same: The country must modernize quickly and work
harder, or it will squander the gains of 70 years of socialism.
   ``The reorganization which we have launched ... this is where we
want to direct our resources, this is where our thoughts are going,
these are our actual programs and intentions, on this we intend to
spend the intellectual energy of our society,'' he has said.
   In November, Gorbachev proved his toughness by firing Moscow
Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin, a former protege who criticized the
slow pace of the reforms at a closed meeting of the party
leadership. But rather than thrust Yeltsin into the utter obscurity
usually reserved for fallen officials, Gorbachev has appointed him
to a high post in the housing bureacracy.
   When widespread demonstrations broke out in the Armenian capital
of Yerevan in February calling for the annexation of a part of
neighboring Azerbaijan, Gorbachev temporarily defused ethnic
tensions by issuing an unprecedented personal appeal for calm.
   In late June, Gorbachev is expected to use a special nationwide
party conference, the first since 1941, to set his stamp even more
firmly on the party by ousting communists who oppose or are
indifferent to his drive for ``perestroika,'' or economic and
social restructuring.
   Like most of his predecessors, Gorbachev rose to the Kremlin
from humble origins.
   Born March 2, 1931, to a peasant family in the farming region of
Stavropol between the Black and Caspian seas, Gorbachev started
work as a laborer on a tractor station when he was 15.
   Little is known about his early years or his life during the
Nazi occupation of southern Russia during World War II. Gorbachev's
mother still reportedly lives in the village of Privolnoye where he
was born.
   In 1950, Gorbachev was among the members of the Komsomol Young
Communist League chosen because of academic ability and
working-class origins to study at the prestigious Moscow State
University.
   It was there he met Raisa Titorenko, an auburn-haired student
from Siberia whom he married in 1954, and whose glamor and wit
would later help him give the Soviet Union a new image abroad.
   In 1955, Gorbachev graduated with a law degree and he returned
to his native Stavropol region to begin a succession of Komsomol
and Communist Party jobs. In 1970, at age 39, he was named party
first secretary in the grain-growing region, becoming Moscow's
viceroy in an area the size of South Carolina.
   In 1979, under then-President Leonid I. Brezhnev, Gorbachev was
brought to Moscow to take charge of the nation's problem-plagued
farm sector. His inability to produce any visible improvement in
food supplies had no apparent effect on his party standing.
   Once in the Soviet capital, Gorbachev quickly widened his
influence, becoming a candidate member on the ruling Politburo in
1979 and a full, voting member the next year.
   After the death in 1984 of Brezhnev's successor, Yuri V.
Andropov, who was believed to be grooming Gorbachev for top-level
responsibilities, Gorbachev reportedly acquiesced in the choice of
Konstantin U. Chernenko for the Soviet leadership.
   But by the time the ailing Chernenko died in March 1985,
Gorbachev had been dubbed the party's ``second secretary'' by a
Soviet editor and was running meetings of the ruling Politburo.
   Within hours of Chernenko's passing, Gorbachev was named party
general secretary, becoming, at age 54, the youngest Kremlin leader
since Stalin.
   In his first months in power, Gorbachev moved quickly to chart a
program of economic modernization, decreed an anti-drinking
campaign, proclaimed the Kremlin's desire to scrap all nuclear
weapons by the year 2000 and had to deal with history's worst
nuclear power accident when an explosion and fire ruptured a
reactor at the Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine in April 1986.

<HEAD>Delta Yields Traces of Another Ancient Mexican Civilization</HEAD>

<DATELINE>XALAPA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deep in a mangrove swamp near the Gulf of
Mexico, archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be
another ancient Mexican civilization.
   So far, the only clues to these mysterious people are a four-ton
stele, or stone slab, covered with hieroglyphic writing and a
19-inch-high clay figure of a fertility-rite priest.
   ``But,'' says Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Xalapa Museum of Anthropology, ``the finds are so promising that
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of
Veracruz state in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society.''
   The stele was found in November 1986. It is covered with
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some Mayan numerals.
   The priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a
flayed sacrificial victim.
   Both are about 1,800 years old.
   ``That would place them in the second century A.D., which is
after the archaeological Olmecs, who flourished in the area from
around 1050 to 500 B.C., and before the Mayas who emerged around
the fourth century A.D,'' Winfield said in an interview.
   Adding to the intrigue, the Mayas lived in the Yucatan
Peninsula, more than 700 miles to the east, Winfield said at the
museum in Xalapa, where the stele and figure are kept.
   ``But there are two dates on the stele in Mayan writing, in
their so-called Long Count Calendar made up of dots and bars,
equivalent to May 22, 143 (A.D.), and July 13, 156 A.D.,'' Winfield
said.
   If the mysterious people did exist, Winfield said, they also
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast: the Totonacas, who
emerged around the seventh century A.D. in the area where the
artifacts were found, or the Huaxtecas farther north, about one
century later.
   ``They could be the Xicalancas, of which Clavijero briefly
talked about,'' Winfield said, referring to the Rev. Francisco
Javier Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787), a Jesuit priest who
was the first to systematically study Mexico's ancient languages
and peoples.
   In his ``History of Ancient Mexico,'' Clavijero in three lines
briefly mentioned the Xicalanca civilization in relation to the
Olmecs, but did not go into details.
   In ``nahuatl,'' the trading language of the Aztecs, who came
much later, Xicalanca means ``the people who live by the Great Body
of Salt Water,'' as the Gulf of Mexico was called.
   The two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in
the village of La Mojarra, where the Piojo River meets the Acula
River. The crocodile-infested region is so swampy that it can be
reached only by boat, Winfield said.
   La Mojarra, with a population of fewer than 200, is up the Acula
about 20 miles south of the port of Alvarado in Veracruz state. But
neither the village nor the Piojo River can be found on any map of
Mexico.
   Carved in relief on the previously polished stele, which is of
basalt, one of the world's hardest rocks, is the full length
profile of a regal figure, a man about 25 years old, holding out in
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering.
   ``He was probably a ruler, or a chief warrior, or a high priest
_ or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region
in ancient times,'' Winfield said.
   The figure wears ear-stops, a tall headdress adorned with four
representations of something like a rain god, trimmed with eight
feathers, and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic.
   A total of 577 glyphs, or picture-words, divided into 21 neat
rows running from top to bottom, plus 33 ``elements'' like the
rain-god representations, cover the rest of the slab.
   ``It was all carved during one continuous period,'' Winfield
said. ``It was a single piece of work. It is the oldest and richest
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient Mexico.''
   About 7 feet tall, slightly oblong and with a gently rounded
top, the stele once stood on the right bank of the Acula, just
outside La Mojarra.
   Over the years, erosion toppled it, and it lay in the river
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of
villagers.
   Archaeologists retrieved the stele, but Winfield said he kept
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed ``without the
pressure that such a discovery creates.''
   The second piece, the ceramic figure of a priest made with the
region's thick orange clay, has a square base. It is the only one
of two artifacts from that area with a base. The other, also in the
museum, is so badly damaged it cannot be studied, Winfield said.
   In the La Mojarra figure, only the head is missing.
   That type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf
cultures. The Aztecs called it in Xipe Totec, or the Lord of the
Flayed, and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring, of
fertility, of abundance and of the metalworkers.
   A peasant at La Mojarra found the shattered figure many years
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces
in a cardboard box.
   ``We got wind of it three weeks ago, and we convinced him to let
the museum have it,'' Winfield said.
   Winfield suspects the La Mojarra area could have been a
ceremonial site.
   ``If so, there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be
found,'' he said.

   Political disorders, ethnic tensions,
poverty and international disputes are churning up the South Seas
in an arc curving sharply northward from New Zealand and back down
to Australia.
   Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Tonga,
Western Samoa, even New Zealand and Australia themselves, have had
a taste of trouble in the past year.
   Most recently it was rioting in Vanuatu over land claims, and in
the French territory of New Caledonia 19 native Kanaks were killed
in a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.
   Fiji has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British
island remains unstable in the aftermath.
   Australia is concerned about what it sees as the speading
influence of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi in the area and the
inroads made by the Soviet Union in what long has been seen as an
``American lake.''
   A commentator in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said the
image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished.
   The past year also has seen riots in Tahiti and political
upheaval in Papua New Guinea over the alleged corruption of Cabinet
ministers.
   New Zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the
Labor Party government of Prime Minister David Lange with a battery
of land and fisheries claims.
   In Australia, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European
settlement 200 years ago.
   In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial and
French presidential elections in New Caledonia, culminating in the
rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists;
21 people were killed.
   On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through Vanuatu's capital,
Port Vila, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died,
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the
rioting over land claims.
   Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis by airlifting
riot-control gear to Vanuatu at Prime Minister Walter Lini's
request.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia linked Libya to the
rioting and said Australia could not stand by as a friendly
country's government is undermined by what he called a
non-democratic process.
   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,''
Hawke said. ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.''
   Vanuatu, formerly the British-French New Hebrides, shocked the
generally pro-Western South Pacific with its decision in 1986 to
establish diplomatic relations with Libya and the Soviet Union.
   Since then, the Soviet Union has sought fishing agreements with
Papua New Guinea and impoverished Kiribati, creating concern in
Australia as well as Washington about Soviet inroads in the region.
   More recently, the Soviet Union has approached Australia for
fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to
Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. Hawke said he
would treat the request with caution.
   Elsewhere in the South Pacific, such nations as Tonga and
Western Samoa face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of
the islanders have migrated to Australia and New Zealand in search
of jobs.
   ``All these are turning the once tranquil South Pacific into an
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the
Sydney Morning Herald said.
   The Sydney Daily Telegraph echoed that concern, calling the
situation a powderkeg.
   ``The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising
discontent,'' the Telegraph said. ``Moscow has been making big
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through
fishery deals and aid.''
   Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of
many Pacific islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. Fiji
and New Caledonia are examples.
   Australia is the major power in the region and its largest aid
donor.
   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden has expressed concern about Libyan
activities, going as far as to close down Libya's diplomatic
mission in Canberra last year after an incident involving the
aboriginal activist Michael Mansell.
   Mansell had returned from Libya saying Gadhafi was prepared to
bankroll a black revolution in Australia.
   The scattered violence in the South Seas has no single
connective thread, although in New Caledonia and French Polynesia
the crises erupted after France refused to follow the regional
pattern of decolonization and independence.
   France already suffers a major image problem in the South Seas
with the bombing of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in New
Zealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on
the Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state
in the region.
   The island states, supported by Australia and New Zealand, have
declared the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.
   In a major turnaround, the United States in 1986 designated the
South Pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the Soviet
Pacific fleet.
   U.S. officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 ships
and patrol craft, including 141 submarines.

<HEAD>Handwork of Rural Women Reaches Out to the World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began with rural women passing on
the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving, grandmother to
mother to daughter.
   Today it is a $4-million-a-year business cooperative, shipping
colorful sweaters around the world, including the United States.
   Manos del Uruguay (Hands of Uruguay) is made up of 18 rural
cooperatives whose workers spin, knit, weave and dye virgin wool,
one of Uruguay's top commodities, entirely by hand.
   It was founded in 1968 by Sara Beisso and four other members of
Uruguay's high society who had second homes on ranch estates
outside Montevideo.
   Unemployment was high in South America's smallest republic at
the time, so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they
knew best _ weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes
and Uruguay's virgin wool.
   The result is a richly colored wool woven in bright, distinctive
sweaters, as well as in rugs, tapestries and placemats. Each
article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a
card accompanying the product.
   Finding many of the artisans' work sites on a map is often
difficult: they include Tacuarembo, said to be the birthplace of
famed tango singer Carlos Gardel, and villages such as Los Mellizos
and Quebracho.
   One thousand workers in more than 40 sites, some using just a
loom or a table under a tree, labor over the sweaters, tapestries
and rugs. Each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish, Mrs. Beisso
said.
   Most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring Argentina,
but many are shipped to the United States, Italy, Japan and
Belgium. Seventy percent of Manos' sweaters are exported, said
Maria Orfila Algalarronda.
   Ms. Algalarronda, 36, was with Manos from its start, weaving
from the village of Paso de la Cruz. Two decades later, she is
secretary counsel of the seven-member directorate (five women, two
men) that oversees Manos' operations from Montevideo.
   Now one of Uruguay's largest exporters of wool, Manos is
well-regarded in business circles for the quality of its work and
fashion acumen.
   ``Manos is an experience that's practically unique in the
world,'' Ms. Algalarronda said in an interview. ``The world is a
very competitive place and Uruguay is a very small place. But at a
minimum Manos has turned into a source of work for 1,000 women.''
   Each sweater, which costs the equivalent of about $30 in
Uruguay, sells for up to $300 in the United States or Japan, said
Maria Cecilia Fernandez, an aide in the promotion department of
Manos' main office in the oldtown section of this capital city.
   In the United States, Manos sweaters can be found in some Saks
Fifth Avenue and Ann Taylor stores, Mrs. Beisso said. Manos
recently opened a small showroom in New York City.
   Ms. Algalarronda said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer
collection, including sweaters specially made for Japan (``smaller
sizes because the Japanese are smaller''), the United States
(``simpler designs'') and Spain (``reds and blacks are popular'').
   A specially designed sofa that Pope John Paul II used at a Mass
in Salto, Uruguay, on his visit in May was produced by Manos, Mrs.
Beisso said.
   Manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative
elect representatives who then report to the directorate in
Montevideo. All business decisions, from designs to marketing and
exports, are made only after receiving input from the interior, Ms.
Algalarronda said.
   Any profits _ 1987 sales were $4 million _ are plowed back into
the business, helping keep those workers employed, which was the
founding purpose of Manos.
   ``It's a fine source of employment but not a good business,''
Mrs. Beisso said. ``The people in the country are the ones who
really profit from this.''

<HEAD>London Zoo Official Wants Animals to Have Fun, Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Shepherdson's job is to take the boredom out
of life for the animals at the London Zoo, putting something more
into their day than sleeping, eating and watching humans.
   He has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage.
   For the mongooses, he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled
with crickets for the animals to try to catch. ``Cricket
dispensers,'' he calls them.
   He plans a light-and-sound show for the orangutans.
   The lanky 28-year-old Englishman, whose doctoral thesis had him
tracking wild badgers by radio at night, became behavioral
enrichment officer six months ago at the London Zoo, the first
British zoo to have one.
   Believing a little work for the animals is healthy, too,
Shepherdson is making some species work for their dinners.
   ``Zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild,'' he
said. ``For example, in the wild, most species spend more than 50
percent of their time foraging for food. ... In the zoo, they get
fed once a day.
   ``You have a choice _ either change the environment, or you
don't keep the animals properly.''
   Trevor Paul, director of research at the Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare, the independent body co-sponsoring
Shepherdson's post, says the project also works well for people who
visit the zoo.
   ``There isn't a great deal of point in them seeing an animal
sitting in a corner behind bars,'' he said.
   He and Shepherdson say that while zoos in many countries are
making cages more natural, few have spent much time studying animal
behavior in relation to their habitats.
   The 161-year-old London Zoo's gibbon monkeys never did much
loafing in their tree-lined outdoor enclosure, but with the change
in their zoo habitat they've become much more feisty.
   Gibbons usually have one mate for life and assert their
territory by singing. London Zoo's pair weren't as musical as they
should have been until Shepherdson hung stereo speakers near their
cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day.
   Thinking they have neighbors, the gibbons now sing, too.
   Shepherdson is also working on a computer keyboard to produce
sounds, food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it.
   Paul said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes, ``so
we'll try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce
sound.''
   Simple toys, often involving food, are best for most animals,
Shepherdson said.
   He had praise for Hal Markowitz, a U.S. behavioral enrichment
pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a serval's
cage, but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be
explored.
   Recently Shepherdson equipped the ring-tailed lemurs' cage with
poles that sway like the trees in the primates' native Madagascar.
   Paul said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior ``is
to make an animal work for its food (and) spend normal amounts of
time foraging.''
   In the kinkajous' cage, carrots, bananas and apples hang from
the ceiling, some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasel-like
creatures.
   Before getting the snacks, the female paced for hours _ one of
the first signs of boredom, said Shepherdson, watching as she
pursued a banana just beyond nose-reach.
   ``Even tortoises pace, I'm told,'' Shepherdson added. ``It's not
a lack of space, it's what you have in that space that's
important.''
   After a cage is outfitted, zoo workers watch the animals for
hours to see how they respond.
   ``In every case so far, there's been a beneficial effect,'' said
Shepherdson. ``If every zoo in the country did these things, it
would be a great step forward in animal welfare.''

<HEAD>Puzzlement Surounds Patriarch's Snub To Soviet Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was all set, a rare convergence in the Soviet
Union of Eastern Orthodox leadership, plus other top Christian
echelons. But then, by some labyrinthine tangle, unravelings
appeared in the Orthodox tapestry.
   Little was clear about why, and official statements about it
were couched in the vague circumlocutions of Byzantine innuendo. It
stunned and bewildered many churchmen.
   ``It's very strange and astonishing,'' says the Rev. John
Meyendorff, dean of St. Vladimir's Seminary at Crestwood, N.Y., and
a leading theologian of the Orthodox Church in America.
   ``However you interpret the official statements, there must be
other reasons. There is something more subtle and typically
Mid-Eastern about it. They never, never say anything directly, but
always sideways.''
   What jolted Eastern Orthdoxy was the abrupt word last week that
its top spiritual leader, Patriarch Demetrios of Constantinople
(modern Istanbul), won't attend Soviet celebrations of
Christianity's 1,000th anniversary there.
   Most all of the Eastern church's nine patriarchs apparently had
been going to be there June 5-16, including, or so it seemed,
Demetrios, making it an unprecedented modern gathering of leaders
of the world's 200 million Orthodox.
   Demetrios had visited the Soviet Union last August, had friendly
meetings with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Pimen and other
clergy, and said he planned to take part in the June celebrations
there.
   Then came the cryptic announcement last week from Orthodoxy's
Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople that Demetrios would not
attend ``because appropriate conditions for participation do not
exist.''
   An Orthodox official in Athens, Greece, maintained then that
Demetrios had determined he would not join in liturgies with
leaders of the Russian Orthodox church in America whose
independence he did not recognize.
   However, that was an old issue, going back 18 years to 1970,
when Russian Orthodoxy granted self-governing status to its U.S.
offspring, the million-member Orthodox Church in America.
   While that status was not officially recognized by the
Ecumenical Patriarchate, no open conflict or breach in communion
occurred over it, and the matter seemed largely disregarded.
   Working relationships have gone on between the Russian-derived
OCA and the 2-million-member Greek Orthodox Church, which remains
under governing oversight of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
   ``There must be some other factor in Greek politics, memory or
worry'' behind Demetrios' somewhat last-hour decision to avoid the
gathering, says OCA's Meyendorff, who had a friendly visit with him
in 1986.
   ``I suspect there's something more to it than the American
situation,'' Meyendorff added in a telephone interview. ``It may be
just a pretext. That's very characteristic. Perhaps the Turkish
government is behind it. It may be an administrative, not
ecclesiastical, conflict.
   ``I personally don't understand it. Something is behind it with
which I cannot fully connect.''
   There also was puzzlement in Greek Orthodox offices in New York,
where the head of American Greek Orthodoxy, Archbishop Iakovos,
promptly called off plans to attend the Soviet celebrations, since
Demetrios isn't going.
   Iakovos, exarch (representative) of Demetrios in the America,
meanwhile was briefed by a Demetrios aide, Metropolitan
Chrysostomos, on the reasons for the sudden reversal of plans.
   Afterward, Iakovos said that Chrysostomos said ``it became
evident that through the millenium celebrations an attempt was
being made to gain pan-Orthodox acceptance of certain
`anti-cannonical conditions'''
   The circuitously worded May 24 statement added:
   ``The cancellation of the trip became obligatory because the
anti-cannonical conditions assume seemingly de facto recognitions
concerning matters, already included in the agenda of the
forthcoming preparatory meeting of the Pan-Orthodox Synod on which
most of the world's Orthodox churches have already taken a position
against.''
   Asked what that meant, Nikki Stephanopoulos, information
director for Greek Orthodoxy, said she just couldn't be sure.
``They didn't want to say what the conditions were. It's a matter
of trying to be diplomatic.
   ``They don't want to offend anybody. The powers that be must
know, but they evidently don't want to say. Maybe there are other
things, but as I see it, it's strictly ecclesiastical.
   ``It came so much out of the blue. It's a big shock. There's a
lot of stories and rumors floating around.''
   The Rev. Michael Roshak, an OCA clergyman, noted that the OCA is
a canonically recognized member of the council of Orthodox bishops
which Iakovos led in organizing 20 years ago.
   Roshak, who heads the Europe@Soviet office of the National
Council of Churches, said that for Demetrios to cancel
participation in the Russian Orthodox celebration was ``certainly
not a sign of conciliarity and unity.
   ``It was not an exemplary thing to do. The church in the Soviet
has enough problems. It has withstood difficulties and is at an
uneasy moment that also has hopeful possibilities. This shift is
very peculiar.
   ``It is too much a revival of Byzantine intrigue.''

   Two Baptist television preachers disagreed
over whether scandal-toppled TV preachers Jimmy Swaggart and Jim
Bakker should be allowed to return to television preaching.
   The Rev. James Robison of Dallas, speaking on an ABC news
program, argued that through forgiveness the gospel offers ``whole
and total restoration on the platform and in the pulpit.''
   However, the Rev. Jerry Falwell of Lynchburg, Va., said clergy
have special responsibilities and ``we don't have the luxury of a
major, scandalous sin, and then going back into the pulpit.''
   Robison said he has been counseling with Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, and ``I think we're going to see a miracle in the lives of
two people I once despised. I want to see them restored. I love
them.''
   Both Bakker and Swaggart were ousted from their TV operations
after sex episodes, but Swaggart defied his denomination's orders
to stay off the air for a year.

   Eight Soviet kids go to school at the Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mass. Vladimir Horowitz performs in Moscow.
Scientists from the superpower nations agree to work together to
combat the ``greenhouse effect'' which is overheating the world.
   Those are some of the consequences from the first meeting
between President Reagan and Soviet Communist Party General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in neutral Switzerland 2{ years ago.
   Agreements reached in Geneva dealing with the environment; air
travel; cultural, scientific and educational exchanges; nuclear
tests and reduction of the risk of nuclear war led to the following
events:
   _A historic treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons was
signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their third meeting in Washington
last December. The groundwork had been done in Geneva.
   _Eight Soviet high school students spent more than a month at
the Phillips Academy and eight American teen-agers studied at
Novosibirsk School of Physics and Mathematics in Siberia.
   _Horowitz, the famous pianist, performed in Moscow in April
1986, the first time he played in his homeland in 60 years.
   _Pan American World Airways and Aeroflot formed a joint venture
for direct flights between Moscow and New York.
   _Members of Congress exchanged views on security and human
rights with Soviet officials in a live television show beamed
directly to audiences in both countries.
   _Twenty Americans toured the Soviets' test site at Semipalatinsk
in Central Asia as part of an agreement to monitor nuclear tests;
Soviet scientists did the same at a site in Nevada.
   _The National Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with
the Soviet Academy of Sciences to begin work on a conservation
project designed to abate climate changes resulting from the
warming of the globe, the ``greenhouse effect.''
   _Eleven Soviet researchers attended a symposium at the
University of Iowa last October on how to transport pesticides and
the presence of chemicals in the environment.
   _The two sides agreed to open consulates in Kiev and in New
York. These have yet to be established, although preliminary work
has started.
   Peripheral agreements are sure to grow out of the fourth
Gorbachev-Reagan summit, opening Sunday in Moscow. Not all summits
lead to agreements; summit No. 2, the October 1986 meeting in
Reykjavik, Iceland, was a public failure, ending in harsh words and
recriminations on both sides.
   ``Much of this is dependent on changes in the Soviet society,''
said Greg Guroff, speaking of the burgeoning number of
people-to-people exchanges. Guroff is acting coordinator of the
U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative at the U.S. Information Agency.
   The treaty signed in Washington that calls for the elimination
of the nuclear missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles
is the most significant agreement reached by the superpowers at the
summit.
   But it has overshadowed some of the less-publicized results of
the summit meetings, which are often the climax of months and years
of behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations.
   One summit issue left over from 1985 _ steps to halt the spread
of nuclear weapons to nations that don't have them _ may resurface
in Moscow, U.S. officials said. The two sides also may sign an
agreement limiting experiments at the Soviet and American test
sites, the Americans say.
   The Reagan administration has refused to push for ratification
of a 1974 treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions for engineering
purposes and a 1976 treaty that limits the size of such explosions
until verification for both is improved.
   But for the average citizen of either country, such agreements
are abstract and remote. Agreements in the scientific, educational
and cultural fields are more likely to have results people can see,
understand and applaud.
   U.S. officials are thrilled with the enthusiasm Americans and
Soviets have shown for getting to know each other, but they say the
Soviets have a long way to go in matching the U.S. response to
exchange programs.
   ``It's a dramatic change compared to the past, and the potential
growth is quite exciting,'' Guroff said. In 1988, for example,
about 15,000 Soviets will visit the United States, while about
120,000 Americans will travel to Russia.
   The 15,000 figure _ high compared to the past _ is tiny when put
into perspective, Guroff said. China has sent about 15,000 students
to the United States as well as many more tourists.

   President Reagan vetoed a major trade bill for

voting to enact the measure over his objections.
   In his veto message Tuesday, Reagan focused his objections on a
provision that would require companies to give their employees
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Within hours, the House voted to override the veto, but it was

draining of its assets and funds by parent Texas Air Corp. leaves
the Miami carrier with a precarious future, a union-commissioned
study concludes.
   The report released Tuesday was commissioned by the Air Line
Pilots Association.
   In Washington, federally mediated hearings opened to settle a
bitter dispute between airline unions and Texas Air over whether
Eastern and sister Continental Airlines should be considered a
single unit for bargaining purposes.

   Texaco Inc. and its largest shareholder have
given themselves the option of three extra days to negotiate as
part of an effort to reach a truce in their feud over the troubled
oil giant's future.
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of
Texaco's stock, has threatened a shareholder fight to elect his
associates to the board at the company's annual meeting next month.
   Texaco said Tuesday that the parties had agreed to a mechanism
under which the annual meeting could be postponed from June 7 to
June 17. Both sides had previously agreed to postpone the meeting
to June 14 if necessary, so the new arrangement gave them three
additional days.

<HEAD>Orders For Durable Goods Up; Reagan Vetoes Trade Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: The Commerce Department reports on merchandise trade for the
first quarter at 10 a.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has vetoed major trade legislation amid signs
that the nation's export business is picking up.
   Reagan said he vetoed the legislation Tuesday, as expected,
because of his objections to a provision that would require
companies to give their employees notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   ``I am convinced this bill will cost jobs and damage our
economic growth,'' Reagan said in his veto message.
   Within hours, the House voted 308-113 to override the veto. The
margin was well above the two-thirds majority required, but it was
thought unlikely that the Senate would go along when it considers
the override after a Memorial Day recess.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said orders for ``big
ticket'' durables, items expected to last three or more years, rose
0.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $116.3 billion.
   The climb followed gains of 0.9 percent in March and 0.1 percent
in February. Orders in April were 8.5 percent greater than a year
earlier.
   The moderate increase in durable goods reinforced earlier
signals of an improving trade picture, some economists said.
   ``It clearly shows that export orders are very strong,'' said
Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WEFA group, a Philadelphia-area
economic forecasting firm.
   The Commerce Department last week reported that U.S. exports
surged 23 percent in March to a record $29 billion, with much of
the strength coming in machinery, aircraft and computers.
   The declining value of the dollar, which is less than half of
what it was three years ago when measured against the Japanese yen,
is bolstering sales of U.S. goods overseas by making them cheaper
when compared with foreign goods.
   Chimerine and David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer in New York, said the cheaper
dollar also is helping U.S. manufacturers by boosting the cost of
imported goods in the United States.
   ``There are some hints that consumers are beginning to turn away
from higher-priced imports in favor of domestic goods,'' Jones said.
   With the signs of economic strength, comes concern that
production in industries is approaching capacity limits, a
development that could fuel price increases.
   However, Chimerine said, ``I think the fears of an inflationary
boom have been exaggerated right from the start. ... Even with an
upturn in exports, we're not in the midst of an economic boom.''
   In other economic reports Tuesday:
   _Home prices continued to skyrocket in several Northeastern
cities during the first three months of 1988, but the hot New York
City market cooled somewhat after the October stock market crash,
the National Association of Realtors said.
   _Mid-May sales of domestically made cars and light trucks rose
2.6 percent from a year ago despite some trimming of buyer
incentive offerings, the auto companies said.
   In the financial markets Tuesday, stock prices rebounded, but
trading remained light. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 21.05 points to 1,962.53, or slightly more than 1 percent.
   Pessimism about interest rates continued to weigh on the market,
sapping investors' willingness to commit their money to stocks.
   In other markets, the dollar and gold slipped as bond prices
advanced slightly.

   Oil futures prices have closed marginally higher
in another trading session of aimless drifting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, contracts for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
settled at $17.40 per 42-gallon barrel, up 5 cents from Monday's
close.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled at 51.80 cents a gallon, up 0.36 cent, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 47.31 cents a gallon, up 0.40 cent.
   Trading consisted of small price moves throughout the session,
said Chris McCormack, an analyst at the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
brokerage firm.
   But he said the market's underlying fundamentals remained
``clearly bearish'' _ despite Monday's gains.
   ``Domestic (oil) stocks are high and the worldwide market is
also stocked with plenty of inventories,'' McCormack explained.
   Given existing demand, these supplies are simply too plentiful
to encourage higher prices, he said.

<HEAD>Junior High Schoolers Make Killing in Georgia Investment Game</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stockmarket is correct.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when most seasoned investors were
having trouble picking winning stocks, 11 middle school students in
Decatur took $300,000 in pretend money and turned a $154,200 profit
in 10 weeks of market action.
   The rookie investors _ seventh- and eighth-graders at Renfroe
Middle School who formed three separate investment teams _ swept
the top three places among 2,700 teams that entered the statewide
Stockmarket Game contest.
   Their money existed only on paper. Their transactions were fed
into a computer at Georgia State University, not at the New York
Stock Exchange.
   All three winning teams' portfolios increased by more than half
during the contest, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose
just 1.3 percent. If a team's initial $100,000 investment had
increased by the same amount as the Dow, it would have netted only
$1,325 for a final portfolio of $101,325.
   ``The odds of three teams from the same school winning the top
three spots are simply astronomical,'' said David Martin, executive
director of the Georgia Council on Economic Education, which runs
the 8-year-old contest for Georgia students in grades 6-12.
   Equally remarkably, Martin said, all seven Renfroe teams made a
profit on their $100,000, while only 22 percent of teams statewide
managed to do so with the Dow hovering close to 2,000 throughout
the contest.
   The students analyzed companies and combed stock analyses, with
some teams profiting from huge purchases of low-cost stocks and
others buying into well-managed firms whose stocks climbed slowly
but surely.
   The common denominator among the top three teams was their
purchase of stock in Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., a
Dallas-based company that owns and operates some video rental
stores and grants franchises for others.
   Students bought the stock for about $31 a share in February and
early March. To their delight, the stock split 2-for-1, and within
weeks, the price of the newly split stock had climbed to about $24
a share _ or $48 for each original share.
   Pat Hone, real-life stockbroker to Renfroe's school librarian,
Karen Allen, had recommended Blockbuster to Ms. Allen as one of
about 10 companies that the students ``might have fun with.''
   ``I gave the stock to other people as an idea,'' said Mrs. Hone,
``but the price just kept climbing and climbing. More cautious
adults looked at it and said, `Oh, it'll pull back,' and they
didn't buy it.''

<HEAD>Domestic Car and Truck Sales Up 2.6 Percent Despite Trimmed
Incentives</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Auto companies' decisions to offer leaner
incentives in mid-May may have slowed domestic car sales but didn't
hurt overall domestic vehicle sales, which rose 2.6 percent from a
year ago, analysts said.
   Sales of domestically built cars, which fell 2.2 percent in
mid-May from a year ago, also dropped in the wake of an early May
rush by buyers hurrying to beat the May 11 expiration of most
major-maker incentive campaigns.
   The eight companies that build cars and light trucks in the
United States sold 345,004 in the nine selling days from May 11-20,
up from 336,381 in the identical period a year ago, the companies
reported Tuesday.
   Sales of domestic cars slipped to 216,325 from 221,127, while
sales of light trucks rose 11.6 percent, to 128,679 from 115,254 a
year ago.
   ``The companies think we're moving into the strong spring
selling season and can afford to take off incentives, but every
time they do, car sales fall,'' said Kathleen Heaney, analyst with
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York.
   The incentive campaigns were extended, but many rebates were
trimmed and some models were removed.
   Sales have remained stronger than expected so far in 1988,
leading the Big Three to increase estimates of total 1988 vehicle
sales, import and domestic, to 15.3 million from 15 million.
   Buying conditions have improved for consumers nationwide through
lower interest rates, strong income gains and low unemployment,
said Ted Sullivan, analyst with Wharton Econometrics in
Philadelphia.
   But much of the additional strength has come along the Pacific
and South Atlantic coasts, where the weakness of the dollar against
foreign currencies has boosted sales of products such as textiles,
light machinery and lumber, he said.
   ``If the dollar does continue to weaken, then the price gap
between import and domestic goods will grow and you'll get this
boost in the interior section of the country, which produces heavy
industrial products,'' Sullivan said.
   Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 U.S. automaker, sold 3.1 percent more
domestic cars and 31.9 percent more domestic trucks during mid-May
than a year ago.
   Chrysler's share of the domestic car market grew to 14.7 percent
from 13.7 percent and its share of the domestic light truck market
rose to 22.9 percent from 21 percent a year ago.
   General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker and the U.S.
industry leader, sold 6.4 percent fewer domestic cars during the
period than a year earlier. But GM's light truck sales rose 10.5
percent.
   GM's share of the domestic car market slipped to 49 percent from
51.3 percent a year ago while truck share held nearly steady at
39.1 percent.
   Ford Motor Co., the world's second-largest automaker, sold 2.6
percent more domestic cars than a year ago, but its light truck
sales slipped 2.4 percent, the company reported.
   Ford's share of the domestic car market rose to 29 percent from
27.9 percent a year ago but its truck share slipped to 35.5 percent
from 37.8 percent.
   Nissan Motor Corp., which reduced car production and increased
truck production at its factory in New Smyrna, Tenn., sold 52.4
percent fewer domestic cars and 112.9 percent more domestic trucks
than in mid-May a year ago.
   Volkswagen, which is gearing down its Westmoreland, Pa., factory
toward this summer's closing, sold 39.3 percent fewer domestic cars
than a year ago.
   Honda Motor Co.'s domestic car sales rose 37.2 percent and
Toyota Motor Corp.'s rose 43.4 percent from a year ago. Mazda Motor
Corp. began building cars at its Flat Rock assembly plant in
September and sold 992 in mid-May.

   Vartanig G. Vartan, a financial writer for The
New York Times since 1963 and the author of two novels, has died of
cancer. He was 64.
   The Manhattan resident who was the main writer of the ``Market
Place'' column in the newspaper since 1983, died Tuesday at
Roosevelt Hospital from cancer of the colon that was detected in
April.
   Born in 1923 in Pasadena, Calif., he grew up in Memphis, Tenn.,
and attended Yale College, where he was graduated in 1948 after his
studies were interrupted by World War II.
   He was a reporter in 1948 with The Laurel (Miss.) Leader-Call
and from 1949 to 1952 with The Tupelo (Miss.) Journal.
   He worked for United Press from 1952 to 1955 in Manhattan and
was a staff financial writer with The New York Herald Tribune from
1955 to 1962. He also worked as a Wall Street columnist for The
Christian Science Monitor from 1957 to 1962.
   After joining the Times, he wrote about such things as the rise
of institutional investing, the corporate takeover boom, the bull
market of the 1980s and the collapse of stocks last October.
   Vartan wrote two novels, ``50 Wall Street,'' which was published
in 1968, and ``The Dinosaur Fund,'' published in 1972.
   He is survived by his widow, the former Cynthia Smith, and by
their son, Kirk Spencer Vartan, also of Manhattan.
   A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday at St.
Thomas Church in Manhattan.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top companies are placing more
emphasis on creativity and communications skills and actively
recruiting students who major in the liberal arts, a new survey
shows.
   About one-quarter of 535 chief executives surveyed by Boston
University explicitly encouraged the hiring of liberal arts
graduates and almost half of their companies said they seek
humanities majors by recruiting on campus.
   ``There is a very substantial hiring of liberal arts graduates
by the nation's major employers,'' Michael Useem, director of the
university's Center for Applied Social Science, who conducted the
survey, said Tuesday.
   Useem said companies with chief executives who advocate a broad
education ``were out there hiring liberal arts graduates way above
average.''
   The study, completed earlier this month, was sponsored by the
Corporate Council on the Liberal Arts in collaboration with the
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.
   ``Top corporate executives are more concerned than before,
certainly than in the 1970s, about the overly narrow education of
some of those who are applying for white collar jobs in the
corporation,'' Useem said.
   Letters seeking information on hiring patterns were sent to the
chief executives of the Fortune 1000, the nation's 1,000 largest
corporations, and 200 mid-size companies. The survey had a 45
percent response rate, including more than half of the nation's top
100 companies.
   In addition, 505 middle and senior managers at large companies
were interviewed by telephone about their career experiences
working with other managers of varying educational backgrounds.
   ``What we've seen in recent years is perhaps more employers have
become convinced of the value of a liberal education in terms of
their long-range needs,'' said Skip Sturman, director of career and
employment services at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.
   Increasing corporate competition in the United States and abroad
has made students with diverse backgrounds more attractive, the
study showed.
   ``Some corporations are facing a much more competitive
environment that places a premium on creativity and innovation, and
they want people who can easily move across boundaries, think in an
interdisciplinary way,'' Useem said.
   A nationwide survey by the University of California at Los
Angeles cited by Useem found that student interest in liberal arts
is rebounding after a 10-year decline.
   It found that 25 percent of first-year college students reported
an interest in a liberal arts major, compared with a low of 21
percent in the early 1980s, but far below the 40 percent of 1970.
   At the same time, 27 percent of students said they were
interested in business arts majors, up from 24 percent in the early
1980s and 16 percent in 1970.
   ``(Companies) are looking for students who can be trained in
that specific industry but will bring to the company a broader
thinker,'' said Liza Bernard, director of career development for
Haverford and Bryn Mawr Colleges in suburban Philadelphia.
   Bernard said on-campus recruiting by businesses has doubled
since 1980, with about 60 companies seeking students last year at
the two liberal arts colleges, each of which have about 1,200
undergraduates.
   The principle attractions for liberal arts students are better
salaries to help pay off tuition debts and training that can be
applied to other jobs.
   ``If you do an undergraduate business degree and then a
(master's of business administration) it seems to me the education
is much too narrow,'' said Mary Maples Dunn, president of Smith
College in Northampton, Mass. ``After all, anyone who wants to make
a success out of a life in business or anywhere else needs to have
a broad understanding of the human condition.''
   At Smith, the largest of the nation's women's liberal arts
colleges, economics was the second most-popular major among this
month's graduates, 177 in a class of 700.

<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. officials say the company's
former headquarters office building in New York City was sold at a
$150 million profit.
   The retailing giant agreed to sell the 45-story building in
Manhattan to a partnership formed by Tishman Speyer Properties and
Trammel Crow Properties, Penney spokesman Duncan Muir said Tuesday.
   Penney is moving its headquarters to the Dallas suburb of Plano.
   William R. Howell, the chairman of Penney, said the building was
sold for $350 million, but the after-tax gain from the sale will
amount to about $150 million at the closing, which is scheduled for
early August.
   Real estate and financial experts had estimated in early 1987
that the building, which was assessed at $100 million for tax
purposes, was worth as much as $400 million.
   Penney moved into the building in 1964 as a major tenant and
purchased it in 1977 for about $40 million, Muir said.
   Penney officials announced in April 1987 that the company would
move its 2,200 management employees to the Dallas area to be closer
to the majority of Penney's 1,400 retail stores.

Industry Ministry reported today.
   Officials attributed the reduced surplus to efforts to increase
imports from the United States and reduce imports from Japan to
correct the bilateral trade imbalance, the source of friction with
the Reagan administration.
   The ministry officials said the Korean won's rise against the
U.S. dollar also slowed the pace of Korean exports to the United
States. The won, South Korea's currency, has risen 8 percent
against the dollar since January.
   South Korea's trade deficit with Japan during the January-April
period shrank to $1.31 billion from $1.85 billion a year earlier.
   The narrowed deficit with Japan was attributed to brisk exports
to Japan helped by the strong Japanese yen as well as less reliance
on Japan for machinery and raw materials.
   South Korean exports to the United States between January and
April were tallied at $6.07 billion, up 19.3 percent from a year
earlier, while imports equaled $3.49 billion, up 45.8 percent.
   South Korean exports to Japan jumped 59.1 percent to $3.56
billion, while imports from Japan rose 19.1 percent to $4.87
billion.
   South Korea posted a worldwide trade surplus of $1.88 billion in
the first four months of this year.

<HEAD>Report Says Texas Undermining Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the financial woes at Eastern Airlines must
be laid at the door of parent Texas Air Corp., which, even as it
decries labor costs, siphons money and assets from the Miami-based
carrier, a new report says.
   ``It is not possible for an airline to shrink its way to
profitability,'' says the report by Touche Ross & Co., an
international accounting and management consulting firm.
   The report, commissioned by the Air Line Pilots Association and
criticized by Eastern and Texas spokesmen, details the sale of
Eastern assets to Texas Air for what it called less than market
value and the apparently heavy management fees Eastern has paid
Texas Air since it was purchased by the Houston-based company in
1986.
   ``Management of Texas Air and Eastern have defined Eastern's
difficulties solely in terms of labor costs and unions; yet
non-union Continental lost substantially more than unionized
Eastern even after the adverse impact of the above transactions on
Eastern is taken into account,'' says the report, largely prepared
by analyst Farrell Kupersmith.
   ``Without the above transactions, the difference in performance
at Eastern and Continental would have been even more dramatic _
with Eastern performing substantially better than Continental,''
according to the report.
   Eastern lost $182 million last year, compared to $258 million at
Continental, also owned by Texas Air.
   Most of Eastern's losses and erosion of liquidity are because of
``upstreaming'' of payments and assets to Texas Air, the report
says.
   Texas Air, which lost a total $466 million last year, is heavily
leveraged with ``junk bonds,'' is dependent on ``upstreaming'' of
cash from its subsidiaries, has overstated its liquidity and
probably lacks credit standing for much new financial backing,
Touche Ross says.
   Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks called the report ``a work of
fiction.''
   ``The Touche Ross analysis is just replete with distortions and
false assumptions,'' Robin Matell, an Eastern spokesman said
Tuesday, citing examples of figures he said were inflated in the
report.
   Matell said the report's conclusions showed ``a lack of
understanding of normal business practices.''
   The Touche Ross report cited $22.5 million paid by Eastern to
Continental for strike preparation fees, $6 million in management
fees paid last year by Eastern to Texas Air, $9.1 million for
administrative and fuel purchasing services paid to TAC, and tens
of millions more paid for use of computers and reservations systems.
   Eastern, which has indicated plans to reduce flying further this
summer, lost available passenger miles estimated worth $50 million
to $75 million because of flying cutbacks, the report says. Some
routes were transferred to Continental.
   ``It is widely accepted that shrinking revenue raises cost per
available seat mile and results in an exaggeration of losses,'' the
report says.
   The Touche Ross report notes that Eastern attempted to sell its
profitable Northeast Shuttle to Texas Air to become a subsidiary; a
Machinists union federal lawsuit has blocked it. There has also
been talk of selling Eastern's Latin American routes.
   Matell said such transactions as the sale of the Systems One
reservations system to Texas Air injected badly needed cash into
Eastern. He said the fees Eastern now pays for use of the
reservations system are less than what Eastern's own cost of
operating the system would be.
   The management fees are ``a miniscule fraction of operating
costs,'' he said.
   Texas Air contends that Eastern labor costs are too high and
that the unions must make some concessions. Eastern is locked in
federal mediation with its largest union, the 12,000-member
International Association of Machinists local.
   The Department of Transportation is expected to soon release the
results of its own study, announced April 13, into the ability of
Texas Air to run airlines. A U.S. House resolution has questioned
Texas Air's commitment to keeping Eastern viable.
   In Washington on Tuesday, federally mediated hearings opened to
settle a bitter dispute between airline unions and Texas Air over
whether Eastern and Continental should be considered a single
airline for bargaining purposes.

   The government expressed relief Wednesday after
U.S. President Ronald Reagan vetoed an omnibus trade bill providing
for sanctions against a Japanese electronics maker and retaliation
against countries that violate international trade agreements.
   The relief was qualified, however, by a vote overriding the veto
in the U.S. House of Representatives and the reasons behind
Reagan's disapproval of the bill.
   Speaking to reporters at his official residence, Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita welcomed the veto and added, ``Concern now is
primarily on domestic issues in the United States. When the
negotiations (between the White House and Congress) begin, the
issues most affecting Japan will be brought out.''
   During a news conference, Hajime Tamura, minister of
international trade and industry, said, ``Our ministry has in the
past requested efforts from the United States government to see
that the trade bill would not be enacted, and we welcome President
Reagan's veto.''
   Opposition to the bill in Japan stems mainly from provisions
requiring retaliation against violations of international trade
agreements and other ``unjustifiable'' practices.
   If enacted, the bill would transfer from the president to the
U.S. Trade Representive the authority to decide what unfair trade
practices another country is engaged in and what, if any,
retaliatory measures to impose.
   A provision imposing sanctions against Toshiba Corp. and one of
its subsidiaries, Toshiba Machine Co., for the subsidiary's sales
of sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union also concerns the
Japanese.
   No mention of the Toshiba sanctions was made in Reagan's veto
message, which focused on curbs on exports of Alaskan oil and a
mandatory requirement forcing businesses to give employees advance
warning of closures or layoffs.
   Toshiba Machine Corp. sold the Soviets milling machines that
could be used to make submarine propellers quieter and more
difficult to detect. The sales violated international rules
regulating trade between the West and communist countries.
   Tamura said he hopes Congress will support Reagan and that the
bill will not be passed. ``But,'' he added, ``for us foreigners it
is very hard to say what will happen in the United States.''
   The House overrode the veto with a margin well above the
two-thirds majority required, but it was thought unlikely that the
Senate would go along when it considers the override after next
week's Memorial Day recess.

   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday after
British authorities cleared the way for Nestle S.A.'s $3.9 billion
bid for Rowntree PLC and for Jacob Suchard's 29.9-percent stake in
the company.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.0
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,791.9 at 12:30 p.m. local time.
   Volume was a moderate 324.9 million shares compared with 243.5
million at midday Tuesday.
   Traders said the market was enlivened by Trade Secretary Lord
Young's decision not to refer the Nestle bid nor the Suchard stake
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   ``Lord Young's choice was terrific news for the whole market,''
said one equity salesman.
   Rowntree's share prices surged on news of the bid, which was
worth 2.1 billion British pounds. After moving down 5 pence to 912
pence, or $16.96, in early trading, the shares jumped to 988 pence,
or $18.37, before easing back to 984 pence, or $18.30.
   Other food shares also benefited from the news, including United
Biscuits, which was up 10 pence at 280 pence, or $5.20, and Cadbury
Schweppes, which added 15 pence to 376 pence, or $6.99.

<TEXT>
   A top U.S. beef industry representative on
Wednesday praised the ``hardline approach'' by U.S. negotiators in
farm trade talks with Japan and predicted a favorable bilateral
beef agreement would be concluded by the end of May.
   Philip Seng, Asia director of the U.S. Meat Export Federation,
said recent concessions by the Japanese government should serve to
break an impasse in talks to renew a beef and citrus fruit pact
that expired in March.
   ``Our government's approach of hardlining it ... has already
paid dividends as far as the U.S. (beef) industry is concerned ...
I think hopefully we can actually realize a bilateral agreement
within the month,'' said Seng, whose federation represents major
U.S. farm organizations and businesses.
   Last week, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita instructed the
government party to seek a speedy solution to the dispute, brought
about by U.S. demands for full access to Japan's beef and orange
markets. He leaves next Monday for an official visit to the United
States.
   Other government officials, including Japan's ambassador to
Washington, have also indicated recently that an agreement was
expected soon.
   Bilateral talks to settle the beef and orange issue broke down
in April after Washington flatly rejected a Japanese plan to
counterbalance market-opening measures with variable surcharges on
beef imports, aimed at bringing import prices up to domestic levels.
   But Seng said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, strongly
dependent on the rural vote, was prepared to scrap the levy or
surcharge and retain the present tariffs.
   LDP Secretary General Shintaro Abe ``indicated that they will
just have a tariff at the end of the day,'' Seng said. Other
officials have ``indicated that they would raise their quota (of
U.S. beef imports) to 40,000 metric tons per annum for the next
three to four years, that's a substantial increase over the
9,000-metric-ton (annual) increases that we've enjoyed so far.''
   Seng also said a bilateral beef agreement would include a
reduction in the power of the Livestock Industry Promotion
Corporation, which controls some 80 percent of beef sold throughout
Japan.
   He ruled out a U.S. move to abolish the quasi-governmental
organization that slaps a 50 percent tax on imported beef prior to
the complicated wholesale stage.
   ``Rather than trying to attack the LIPC open-faced ... (the U.S.
strategy is) to effect change, meaningful change, in the role of
the LIPC and limit the amount of control that they do have.''
   On May 4, the United States brought the dispute to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum to rule on
international trade disputes. But both U.S. and Japanese officials
have maintained they will continue efforts to forge a new agreement
out of GATT.
   U.S. beef shipments to Japan account for some 85 percent of the
193 million pounds the nation exports annually, worth some $600
million. That figure, says Seng, could be multiplied by three to
four times if Japan fully liberalizes its market.

<HEAD>Deere Posts 145 Percent Gain in Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm equipment manufacturer Deere & Co. says
an improved farm economy helped boost its net earnings in the
second quarter by 145 percent, compared with the year-ago period.
   ``North American retail sales of John Deere agricultural and
industrial equipment during fiscal 1988 have increased
significantly over last year's levels,'' Chairman Robert A. Hanson
said in a statement Tuesday.
   Deere reported net income of $86.4 million, or $1.26 per share,
for the three months ended April 30, compared with $35.3 million,
or 52 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Net sales increased 27 percent, from $1.14 billion to $1.45
billion, the company said.
   ``During the remainder of the year, we expect retail sales ...
to exceed those in the final half of 1987,'' Hanson said.
   Worldwide production of all Deere products in 1988 was scheduled
to be about 30 percent higher than actual 1987 output, he noted.
   ``The agricultural economy has continued to strengthen in 1988
with improvement in a number of important agricultural economic
indicators,'' Hanson said. ``Price competition remains keen in our
markets, but the fundamentals of our businesses are stronger and
our operating results greatly improved.''
   Gary Benjamin of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago agreed that
Deere had been helped by a turnaround in the agricultural economy,
noting that record high farm earnings of $55 billion were posted in
1987.
   ``Earnings this year are expected to be close to last year's
record high,'' Benjamin said. ``That is helping to improve farmland
values. Farmers feel a little more confident now about going out
and making capital expenditures.''
   Deere's net income for the first six months of 1988 was about
$154 million, compared with last year's net loss of $157 million,
which included the adverse effects of a strike through the first
quarter.
   Analysts said the weak dollar probably helped Deere's exports to
increase by 36 percent, to $340 million from $251 million last year.
   They also noted that Deere has drastically cut its workforce in
the past nine years, lowering employment costs. Steven Colbert of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said Deere employment last year
was only 37,931, compared with 65,392 in 1979.

<HEAD>Murray Ohio Urges Stockholders To Wait For Company Advice On
Electrolux Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials of Murray Ohio Manufacturing
Co. have urged shareholders to refrain from selling their stock
until the company can review a $197 million takeover bid by
Sweden's AB Electrolux.
   Murray Ohio stock jumped $8 a share to close at $59.25 Tuesday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, indicating that
investors expect Electrolux to sweeten its current $52-a-share
offer.
   In a letter to shareholders, Murray Ohio Chairman W.M. Hannon
and President J.L. Duncan said the company's board was
``considering the Electrolux offer. The board will complete its
review and communicate with you no later than June 7 to advise you
of the company's recommendation.''
   Analysts said the offer must rise to at least $227 million _ $60
per share _ to be accepted. Murray directors rejected an earlier
Electrolux bid of $48 per share, or $182 million.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman removed one
roadblock to Electrolux's bid, but Murray immediately appealed to
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Wiseman denied Murray's request to block Electrolux from
proceeding with its offer and said, ``I know of no law permitting
the court to enjoin the transfer of stock. We still have in this
country respect for private property.''
   A three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit scheduled a hearing
Friday in Nashville on Murray's appeal.
   Murray manufactures lawn mowers and bicycles at its
Lawrenceburg, Tenn., plant. AB Electrolux is an international
appliance giant with a product line that includes chain saws and
line weed trimmers.
   Boyd Poston, analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis,
predicted AB Electrolux would have to bid at least $60 a share for
its offer to be considered, since the market price was so high.
Poston said he knew of no other company seeking to acquire Murray,
but ``you almost feel like there's got to be somebody else in
there.''
   David Leibowitz, analyst for American Securities Corp. in New
York, said the jump in Murray stock prices Tuesday ``is a great
indication that there are those on Wall Street who believe that the
offer will go higher.''
   AB Electrolux, which has no connection with vacuum cleaner
manufacturer Electrolux Inc. of Marietta, Ga., operates a Tappan
range plant at Springfield, Tenn., north of Nashville.

<HEAD>American Airlines Announces Change in AAdvantage Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is phasing out its
AAdvantage frequent-flier program in favor of two new plans _ one
that requires fewer miles for free trips but has more restrictions,
officials said Tuesday.
   In one of two new programs _ PlanAAhead _ members must fly
20,000 miles to receive trips anywhere in the continental United
States or Canada, and 30,000 to get trips to Hawaii, Mexico or the
Caribbean, spokesman Frank DiNuzzo said.
   Under the existing AAdvantage program, members had to fly 35,000
miles to receive free trips, but also could use credits to fly to
Mexico, Hawaii or the Caribbean.
   On the PlanAAhead program, however, no free flights are
available on some holidays, including Christmas and New Year's Day,
and seating may be limited, DiNuzzo said. Under the AAdvantage
program, there are no holiday ``blackouts.''
   The second new program, AAnytime, has a mileage threshold double
that of PlanAAhead but no blackouts or limits on the number of
seats available, DiNuzzo said.
   There is also a three-year expiration date under mileage credits
earned under the new programs.
   People who join AAdvantage after Jan. 1 will be covered only by
the new programs; credits that current AAdvantage members earn
after June 30, 1989, will also apply only to the new programs,
DiNuzzo said.
   ``The new award structure allows more flexibility in how members
use awards,'' said Mike Gunn, senior vice president-marketing at
Fort Worth-based American.
   ``Although there may be some limits on the number of award seats
on certain flights, initially at least 50 percent of our seats will
be made available for award use,'' he added.''

   Lord Plumb, the president of the European
Parliament, on Wednesday hailed a ``historic'' agreement between
Europe's communist and Western trade organizations.
   Under the agreement, announced in Brussels, the Soviet-led trade
bloc known as Comecon grants diplomatic recognition to the European
Economic Community, including West Berlin.
   It will be initialed in Moscow on June 9 and officially endorsed
by EEC foreign ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg on June 14.
   In winding up a two-day official visit to Norway, which is not
an EEC member, Lord Plumb said at a press conference: ``This is a
historic moment we've waited for for a long time.''
   ``We can`t expect immediate results, but on long sight this
agreement will be of great importance for development of both trade
and political relations in Europe,'' he said.
   ``The agreement may be of especially great importance for
neutral countries like Austria,'' making it easier for them to
trade with the European Economic Community, he added.
   The EEC will set up an embassy in Moscow and Comecon will set up
an embassy in Brussels, Lord Plumb said.
   Members of Comecon, or the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, are the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Mongolia, Vietnam and Cuba.
   According to Lord Plumb, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are
currently negotiating bilateral trade agreements with the EEC, and
Poland, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union have signalled that they also
want such agreements.

   Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad
Ali showed up at K mart Corp.'s annual meeting Tuesday for another
round in his fight to sell shoe polish throughout the retail chain.
   ``Muhammad Ali's Champion Brand'' shoe polish is a product of
Champion Brand Industries, which the former boxer controls.
   Ali, a K mart shareholder, and several friends sat in the front
row at the meeting, held in the company's cafeteria and attended by
about 1,000 people.
   In response to questions from Ali's group, K mart Chairman
Joseph Antonini said K mart had accepted delivery of $500,000 worth
of Champion Brand wax shoe polish was test marketing it in selected
stores. He said sales would be monitored.
   Company officials would not disclose which stores are selling
the product.
   Ali's business partner and friend, Arthur Morrison, said K mart
agreed under pressure from Ali and supporters at last year's annual
meeting to buy $700,000 worth of liquid shoe polish along with the
$500,000 in wax shoe polish. But he said K mart turned away the
liquid shoe polish shipments.
   Morrison said Ali supporters are calling for a boycott of K mart
over the shoe polish issue.
   Separately, Antonini said K mart plans to open at least 100 new
discount stores and expand 80 of its current stores in 1988 and
1989.

   The number of jobless in the 12 European
Economic Community nations totalled 16.3 million on March 30, down
340,000 from February, the EEC reported Wednesday.
   Despite this drop, Eurostat, the EEC's statistics agency, said
the March figure corresponded with a seasonally adjusted jobless

   Eurostat said in seasonally unadjusted terms, unemployment fell
in all EEC nations in March, but the declines from February
differed greatly from country to country.
   It gave these seasonally unadjusted March unemployment figures
for the EEC member states, with the percentage drop from the
previous month in brackets:
   Belgium, 458,500 (3.7 percent); Denmark, 255,000 (2 percent);
France, 2.54 million (3.3 percent); Greece, 133,000 (7 percent);

   Stock prices continued to rise in early trading
today as the volume of trading picked up from its recent
sluggishness.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.61 to 1,974.14
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 11 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 683 issues up, 250
down and 419 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.84 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The modest increase in the volume of trading was a welcome sign
to stockholders. Analysts say the stock market will not make a
healthy advance until the volume of trading increases.
   Investors have been preoccupied with high interest rates and the
possibility that they could go still higher.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street in two ways _ by cutting
into the corporate profits that support stock prices, and by
causing investors to take money into stocks and put it into
high-yielding debt instruments.
   Utah Power & Light, which dominated the list of most actively
traded issues, was unchanged at 30|. Big traders, mainly Japanese,
buy the stock to capture its dividend and then quickly sell it back.
   Navistar was unchanged at 6, Citicorp was up \ at 22} and
Philips Petroleum was up \ at 16}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.80 to 144.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.59 at 291.11.

   Ford Motor Co. will introduce a sporty
version of its popular Taurus sedan for the 1989 model year, hoping
to entice buyers with families who still want zip in their cars.
   Chairman Donald E. Petersen said Tuesday the new,
high-performance car will be able to accelerate up to 140 mph,
using an engine built in conjuncton with Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd. of
Japan. It also will be built lower to the ground than the
conventional Taurus.
   The SHO Taurus, for ``super high output,'' will sell for less
than $20,000 and will be produced in limited numbers at the
Hapeville Assembly Plant just south of Atlanta, Petersen said
during a visit to the plant.

<HEAD>BAT Industries' Profit Jumps 14.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC said Wednesday its
first-quarter, pre-tax profit rose 14.1 percent over a year ago on
a robust performance by its tobacco operations.
   That performance more than offset a decline in contributions
from financial services and disappointing results in the United
States, the company said.
   Pre-tax profit for the first three months of 1988 came to 283
million pounds, or $529 million at current exchange rates. That was
up from 248 million pounds in the year-earlier period.
   Net profit increased 14 percent to 163 million pounds, or $305
million, compared with 143 million pounds in the 1987 first
quarter, the company said.
   Revenues gained 4.2 percent, to 3.97 billion pounds, or $7.42
billion, from 3.81 billion pounds.
   The company said the adverse effects of currency movements
reduced pre-tax profit by 17 million pounds, or $32 million, in the
latest period. This reflected the pound's gains against European
currencies, it said.
   Tobacco operations contributed 163 million pounds, or $305
million, to operating profit, up from 120 million pounds, helped in
part by strong gains in exports to Japan following greater opening
of the Japanese market to imported cigarettes, BAT Chairman Patrick
Sheehy told a news conference.
   Operating profit from financial services, however, fell to 88
million pounds, or $165 million, from 92 million pounds, as a
result of a decline in the value of investments of BAT's Eagle Star
unit following October's stock market crash.
   Paper and pulp interests had operating profit of 64 million
pounds, or $120 million, up from 60 million pounds.
   The company said the weakness of the U.S. retailing market in
the fourth quarter of 1987 continued in the first three months of
1988.
   BAT has launched a hostile, $4.5 billion-dollar takeover offer
for Farmers Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based insurance company.

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank by 12.7 percent
from January through March, the biggest improvement in five years,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department reported that the difference between
what the United States imports and what it exports totaled $35.9
billion for the first three months of 1988, down from a deficit of
$41.2 billion in the last three months of 1987.
   The 12.7 percent decline represented a dramatic turnaround in a
deficit that has steadily worsened oveyears. It was
the biggest quarterly improvement since an 18.9 percent decline in
the fourth quarter of 1982.
   The new figures confirmed an improvement that had already shown
up in the department's montr the last five hly merchandise trade reports.
The
earlier figures showed a 16.4 percent drop in the deficit to $36
billion in the first quarter, compared to $43.1 billion in the
fourth quarter.
   Today's figures are smaller because they subtracted factors such
as the cost of shipping and insurance and military sales from the
monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted
for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The improvement in the first quarted the fact that
exports climbed faster than imports, although both hit all-time
highs.
   Exports jumped 9.8 percent to a record $74.7 billion while
imports rose 1.3 percent to a record $110.6 billion.
   The administration is counting on strong export sales to provide
close to half of total economic growth in the United States this
year. The figures for the first quarter show that this estimate is
on track.
   President Reagan has also pointed to the improvement in the
trade deficit as an argument against passing protectionist trade
legislation. Reagan on Tuesday vetoed the omnibus trade bill and
Republicans in the Senate are expected to cite the big drop in the
trade deficit as a strong argument that this would be the wrong
time to threaten trade retaliation against other countries who are
purchasing record levels of U.S. products.
   Exports of both agricultural and non-agricultural goods
increased in the first quarter.
   The trade deficit with Japan fell by $1.9 billion to $12.9
billion. The trade deficit with Western Europe dropped by an even
sharper $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion. The deficit with the newly
industrialized countries of Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and
Taiwan, fell to $1.1 billion to $6.9 billion.

   Stock prices continued to edge higher today, but
the market showed no signs of a broad-based rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.95 to 1,972.48 in
the first 1{ hours of trading as trading remained thin.
   Gainers outnumbered losers nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 757 issues up, 393 down
and 504 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 48.92 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street, less than the 61.44 million that changed hands
as of the same time Tuesday.
   Analysts say the stock market will not make a healthy advance
until the volume of trading increases.
   Investors have been preoccupied with high interest rates and the
possibility that they could go still higher.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the
corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing
investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding
debt instruments.
   Interest rates may go higher in the short term, but they are
likely to decline in the longer term because it will become
apparent that the economy is not overheating, Neil Eigen, senior
vice president of Integrated Resources Management, said today.
   ``The economy is not booming and rates will not go a lot
higher,'' Eigen said. When rates fall, he said, ``I think stocks
can go a lot higher.''
   In economic news, the government said the merchandise trade
deficit on a balance of payments basis narrowed to $35.95 billion
in the first quarter from $41.19 billion in the fourth quarter.
   Utah Power & Light, which headed the list of most actively
traded issues, was up [ at 30} with more than 4 million shares
traded. Big traders, mainly Japanese, buy the stock to capture its
dividend and then quickly sell it back.
   West Point-Pepperell was up 4[ to 35{. The company said Farley
had filed for federal clearance to acquire between 15 percent and
25 percent of its common shares.
   Navistar was unchanged at 6, Citicorp was up \ at 22} and
Philips Petroleum was up \ at 16}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.59 to 144.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.71 at 291.23.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.05 to

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have given Bank of New York
Corp. a 45-day extension for completing its hostile tender offer
for Irving Bank Co., and the unwanted suitor extended its bid until
the end of this week.
   The Federal Reserve Board's action Tuesday prompted New York
State Supreme Court Justice Herman Cahn to delay acting on Bank of
New York's challenge to Irving's latest anti-takeover ``poison
pill'' defense.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Irving reinstated its board of directors
after a final count showed it had beaten Bank of New York in the
bitter proxy battle for control of the company.
   Cahn also set up a briefing schedule for Bank of New York's
challenge of the election results. The company must submit
supporting documents by next Tuesday, and a hearing on the issue
will be held by June 3.
   Bank of New York had asked federal regulators for an extension
to consummate its proposed takeover of Irving, which has been
stalled by a number of factors, including a series of lawsuits, the
outcome of the proxy fight and from Irving's poison pill.
   Although the Fed granted a 45-day extension Tuesday, it noted it
was concerned about some possible adverse affects of the merger.
The board required Bank of New York to notify the Fed when it had
acquired 5 percent of Irving's shares and obtain the board's
permission before proceeding with the takeover.
   The Fed had given Bank of New York conditional approval for the
merger in February. That approval was scheduled to expire on today.
   Bank of New York has maintained it will proceed with its $1.1
billion tender offer, and run Irving as a separate subsidiary,
regardless of whether it could win control of Irving's board. The
offer is for $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of
Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding.
   It was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, although it was
extended until midnight Friday and conditioned upon Bank of New
York receiving at least 67 percent of Irving's shares. As of last
Monday, Bank of New York held about a 50 percent stake in Irving,
including shares it owned and those tendered.
   Irving recently took steps to prevent Bank of New York from
proceeding with its tender offer. Last week, it amended its
``poison pill'' so that it would be activated should any unwanted
investor acquire at least 20 percent of Irving shares on the open
market. The poison pill previously would have gone into effect in
the event of a takeover not supported by management.
   Poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition. In Irving's case,
all existing shareholders except Bank of New York would be allowed
to buy Irving shares for half-price once Bank of New York acquired
20 percent of Irving shares.
   Irving has steadfastly rejected Bank of New York takeover
proposals, instead opting for a friendly merger with the state-run
Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest bank.
   The company announced today that its board unanimously approved
Banca Commerciale's sweetened cash offer of $80 a share for a 51
percent stake in Irving. The revised bid, up $5 a share from the
previous offer, was conditional on Irving keeping intact the latest
anti-takeover defense it adopted to fend off Bank of New York.
   The Banca Commerciale bid is part of a complex restructuring
plan that includes sale of Irving assets, several cost-cutting
measures and a special $10 dividend. The proposal still needs
regulatory approval.
   Bank of New York spokesman Owen Brady said his company has no
plans to raise its tender offer.
   The company had proposed increasing the stock portion if Irving
agreed to hold friendly talks and dismantle its poison pill
defense. But Irving's board of directors unanimously rejected that
proposal last week.
   In a reconvened annual shareholders' meeting Tuesday, Irving
said its shareholders re-elected the incumbent board over Bank of
New York's slate of 16 nominees by 52 percent to 48 percent. The
count confirmed preliminary results that were released earlier this
month.
   Brady said it would file suit in New York State Supreme Court to
declare the results invalid. The company claimed that four Irving
shareholders with more than 950,000 shares of Irving stock
confirmed that their votes were improperly counted.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Ruling Against Hallmark Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATTY REINERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling
temporarily forbidding Hallmark Cards Inc. from making greeting
card designs resembling those of a small competitor, clearing the
way for a full trial of the company's $50 million damage suit
against Hallmark.
   ``Blue Mountain Arts has pushed the bullies back to the alley.
We've been waiting and waiting on the ruling and it's entirely in
our favor,'' said Bob Gall, general manager of the Boulder,
Colo.-based company, which won the injunction. ``We are absolutely
ecstatic.''
   Blue Mountain brought suit against Hallmark, based in Kansas
City, Mo., in July 1986, alleging that Hallmark's ``Personal
Touch'' line of greeting cards is deceptively similar to Blue
Mountain's ``AireBrush Feelings'' and ``WaterColor Feelings'' lines.
   Blue Mountain alleged that Hallmark was guilty of unfair
competition and copyright infringement.
   A federal court ruled in November 1986 that Blue Mountain's two
card lines have ``an inherently distinctive and highly uniform
overall appearance that is recognizable and attributable to Blue
Mountain.''
   It ordered Hallmark to stop producing and marketing 83 specific
greeting card designs.
   The Blue Mountain cards are characterized by backgrounds of soft
colors done with air brush blends or light watercolor strokes.
   In April, Hallmark appealed the injunction order, arguing that a
single greeting card company should not have ``perpetual rights to
a style of art, a style of text and a concept of their combined
use.''
   In Tuesday's decision, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the injunction, saying the lower court was correct in
determining that the combination of features comprising the trade
dress, or the overall appearance, of Blue Mountain's cards can be
protected.
   A date for a full trial is expected to be scheduled now that the
appeal has been decided. Blue Mountain is seeking $50 million in
damages from Hallmark and will fight what they consider Hallmarks's
other ``copycat'' card designs.
   ``It's not only a victory for Stephen and me and for Blue
Mountain, but it's also a victory for the arts and for all creative
people,'' said Susan Polis Schutz, a poet who co-founded Blue
Mountain with her husband Stephen Schutz.
   Polis Schutz said Blue Mountain's main complaint was the look of
the cards, which she said confused everyone, ``including myself.''
   ``This decision means you can create something and not have to
worry about it being stolen,'' she said. ``One of the things that
Stephen and I learned is that it is possible to stand up for your
rights no matter how small you are or how big your opponent is.''
   Charles W. Hucker, a spokesman for the greeting card giant, said
Tuesday night that Hallmark was disappointed but not surprised by
the decision.
   ``We will consider making a further appeal. It is important to
understand that this is a preliminary decision based on a limited
airing of the issues,'' Hucker said. ``We will have the opportunity
to present our case in full for the first time at the trial.''
   Hucker noted that the Blue Mountain suit contended Hallmark
copied the smaller company's look.
   ``It is absolutely not true, and they know it's not true, that
we copied specific designs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened modestly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as fears of dry weather
continued to dominate the market.
   Little rain was forecast for the nation's midsection for the
rest of this week, and the newly planted corn and soybean crops
need rain to get off to a good start, analysts said.
   ``There's also some follow-through buying from yesterday's
sharply higher close and that's about it,'' said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``There's really nothing
else of any consequence.''
   Lespinasse said bullish traders hoped to bid the November
soybean contract above its lifetime high of $8.08 a bushel today. A
successful test of that barrier could prompt a new surge of buying,
he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.51 a bushel; corn was } cent to
1} cents higher with July at $2.20 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1
cent higher with July at $1.76 a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to
6 cents higher with July at $7.86 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .27 cent lower with June at 72.10
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .90 cent lower with
May at 80.85 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with June at 53.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent to .13 cent lower with July at 53.57 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

   Terence J. Fox, who served 23 years as
chief executive officer and largest shareholder of Iroquois Brands
Ltd., has sold all his Iroquois stock and left the company.
   Fox sold his stock, comprising 21.4 percent of the total
outstanding shares, to Malcolm H. Stockdale of Houston, the company
said Tuesday.
   Stockdale was named chief executive officer and elected chairman
of the Iroquois board. He is president and chairman of the board of
Bio International Inc., an engineering-equipment maker incorporated
in Utah.
   Fox declined to say why he decided to sell his shares and leave
the board, but said it was ``a mutual decision.''
   ``I'm quite pleased with the situation,'' he said.
   In November 1985, Fox was arrested at a Hartford hotel and
charged with possession of cocaine and possession of narcotics
paraphernalia after police said they found 17 grams of cocaine in
his room. In April 1986, he was granted accelerated rehabilitation,
a program allowing dismissal of charges if a probationary period is
successfully completed.
   During the last four years, Iroquois has sold its biggest and
best-known businesses _ including Champale _ reducing revenue in
1987 to less than half the level the company had reported four
years earlier.
   The remaining businesses _ Schiff health food vitamins and
Pharmacaps Inc., which makes gelatin capsules most commonly used
for Vitamin E _ have reported losses for the past five years.
   Last week, the company reported first quarter earnings of
$107,000, or 18 cents a share, compared to $187,000, or 26 cents a
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the latest quarter was $19 million, down from $21.5
million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small companies still hunger to see their names
on a filigreed stock certificate, but it's a luxury few can afford
these days.
   The companies that can make a convincing sales pitch for their
stock to a jittery, post-crash Wall Street are those with
substantial track records and solid, innovative products.
   But other young companies are shrinking from the prospect of
selling stock at fire-sale prices and instead are knocking on the
doors of venture capitalists, who may ask for a few board seats in
return for capital.
   Industry insiders say the market crash and its aftershocks have
been devastating for less-developed companies by limiting the
financial tools they depend on.
   ``A lot of companies won't be financed, and it will lead to a
pruning out, a survival of the fittest,'' one expert said.
   Since last October's Black Monday, the number of initial public
offerings raising $25 million or less _ a size typical for small
companies _ has fallen off dramatically.
   In April 1987, 28 such offerings were recorded, raising a total
of $205.4 million, according to IDD Information Services Inc. Last
month, only 10 offerings were made for a mere $53.2 million. The
intervening months saw even fewer new issues.
   A pervasive lack of investor confidence is the main reason it
has become ``almost impossible for companies without a strong
record of earnings or strong evidence of exceptionally powerful
technology to go public,'' said Martin Orland, president of Amev
Venture Management Inc.
   Many companies simply scrapped their plans after the Oct. 19
market collapse. Orland had three companies that had registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue stock, but
they aborted their plans rather than slash the offering price.
   Pulse Engineering Inc., a San Diego maker of electronic
components that hoped to raise about $15 million by selling shares
for between $9 and $10, was one of those companies.
   Orland said the stock price would have been ``substantially
lower'' had the company decided to go ahead with the issue in the
wake of the crash. Instead, the group was able to secure additional
bank financing.
   Not all companies are that fortunate.
   ``A lot can't fill the gap, and we are seeing many situations of
aborted public offerings coming to us for financing,'' Orland said.
   But money from venture capitalists is exchanged for a piece of
ownership, forcing management to decide how much control they are
willing to give up.
   For young companies, the alternatives can be limited. Some have
opted to go public anyway at lower offering prices, while others
are bootstrapping their way along _ simply growing slower without
the funds. Still others are seeking mergers or equity links to
larger corporations.
   NeoRx Corp., a Seattle-based biotechnology firm, had registered
with the SEC in March to raise $30 million but has since witnessed
``a deterioration in the market, particularly in biotechnology and
pharmaceutical stocks,'' said Chief Financial Officer Robert
Littauer.
   In the meantime, Littauer said the company is looking for other
methods of financing until the market turns around. So far, the
company has held discussions with a Japanese company and a European
firm.
   ``We would be doing that anyway,'' Littauer said, ``but we might
make the terms more responsive to our current situation _ we might
ask for a larger up-front payment so we can use it as a tool to
help our current financial situation.''
   Companies that are braving the stock market's choppy waters are
established, often showing annual revenue in excess of $50 million.
   Clean Harbors Inc., a Boston-based hazardous waste firm with $50
million in annual revenue, raised $10 million last November. Shares
that initially sold for $9 each are now trading in the $14 range.
   Sandy Robertson, a partner in the San Francisco investment
banking firm Robertson, Colman & Stephens Inc., attributed the
issue's success to ``institutional investors who understood the
hazardous waste business,'' which he described as ``immune from the
economy as a whole.''
   Another market survivor is Tampa, Fla.-based Silk Greenhouse
Inc., a budding retail chain of artificial flowers whose stock
traded as high as $16 a share after intially selling at $11.
   ``The market saw it as a new, unique retailing concept,''
Robertson explained.
   In addition to providing companies with needed working capital,
going public has more subtle benefits. Entrepreneurs and small
business owners agree there is a certain ``status'' to being
publicly held.
   ``It makes a company seem much more substantial, and that's very
important to many of our customers,'' said Edward Wilner, president
of the 4-year-old Long Island software developer Software
Performance Group Inc.
   ``It conveys the impression we're here to stay, and it's
important to original investors to have a mechanism for cashing in
on their investment,'' said Wilner, who saw his own plans to issue
stock delayed by three months. Software Performance currently is
scheduled to go public in September rather than June.
   Wilner noted that the small size of the offering _ the company
is seeking to raise only between $2 million and $3 million _ helped
insulate it from post-crash queasiness.
   ``There are still underwriters and investment bankers that need
to make a living,'' Wilner noted. Ironically, he found the crash
``actually left us with an opportunity ... because there are not a
lot of companies left to do an offering, and a strong company that
is set up properly actually is more attractive now.''
   Indeed, for venture capitalists who often specialize in
early-stage financing, business is busy.
   ``We're looking at more, we're traveling more, but we're being
discriminatory,'' Orland said.
   While investors may not be attracted by the potential of
handsome returns that go hand-in-hand with speculative deals,
venture capitalists have before them some significantly undervalued
companies.
   ``People ask if the market window (for financing) is open or
shut, but the market really is like a filter,'' Robertson
explained. ``After the crash, the market is tougher and the filter
is finer, but `fine' companies, if you will, the really good
companies can get through. There's billions out there.''

   When the publication Newsweek on Campus was
first sent to college nearly six years ago, its owners hoped
students would read it and later graduate to its parent, Newsweek.
   Not enough students made the step up, however, and Newsweek Inc.
recently announced that Newsweek on Campus will make its final
appearance this fall.
   It won't be the only dropout among college magazines, although
their reasons for calling it quits vary.
   McGraw-Hill Inc. announced that it was suspending publication of
the 5-year-old Business Week Careers magazine, citing lagging
advertising support for campus publications.
   And Whittle Communications, a media concern based in Knoxville,
Tenn., published the final issue of its 17-year-old Campus Voice
magazine in March, saying it had become too hard to stand out from
the crowd of college magazines.
   Media analysts say a shakeout was inevitable as the number of
magazines, newspapers, billboards, sampling programs and other
media options aimed at college students mushroomed in the mid-1980s.
   Publishers felt advertisers would salivate at the chance to
reach an audience numbering about 12 million with estimated
purchasing power of about $30 billion a year, malleable brand
loyalties and promising earnings prospects.
   The audience remains attractive for some advertisers, such as
those in automotives, electronics, beverages and snack foods, but
their ad budgets have limits, said Leo Scullin, director of print
media for the advertising agency Young & Rubicam.
   ``With a preponderance of media vehicles available, the
advertiser made his choices,'' Scullin said. He said they tended to
pick magazines with ``pizazz and excitement'' because there was a
better chance students would look at them.
   Randy Achee, president of Alan Weston Communications Inc., a
Burbank, Calif.-based company that publishes three magazines
targeted at segments of the college audience, estimated national
advertisers spend about $35 million a year specifically to reach
college students.
   That figure includes only product and service advertising, not
recruitment advertising or local and regional ad spending, which
Achee said could push total spending toward $100 million a year.
   Achee said his company has survived the shakeout by focusing on
narrow segments of the college market and using the mail instead of
simply leaving the magazines at high-traffic spots on campus.
   Weston's Moving Up magazine is sent to about 500,000 men who are
college juniors, seniors or graduate students; College Woman goes
to about 700,000 women who are college students and College
Musician goes to 100,000 college music students through their
teachers.
   Even those who are closing magazines say the audience remains
attractive.
   Newsweek intends to promote its main magazine more aggressively
on campus. McGraw-Hill plans to offer advertisers a chance to be
the only sponsor of special editions of Business Week Careers.
Whittle plans multi-panel wallboards for the campus that will carry
news, features, job information and advertising.
   Gerard Smith, the publisher of Newsweek Inc., said Newsweek on
Campus was never intended to be a major profit contributor. It was
launched in September 1982 as ``a way of introducing college
students to Newsweek's style of reporting and editing,'' he said.
   The strategy didn't work. Although Newsweek on Campus
circulation reached 1.3 million this year, Smith said there was
insufficient indication that readers later subscribed to Newsweek
and some evidence that the number of students reading Newsweek
itself had dipped. It appeared six times a year, and its last issue
will be the back-to-school edition this fall.
   Smith said Newsweek on Campus was at a disadvantage in selling
ad space because some competitors who publish magazines also
offered sampling programs and other promotions aimed at college
students. Weston, for instance, offers sampling, direct mail and
college newspaper ad placement services, a movie guide and campus
promotions as well as magazines.
   Time Inc. plans to continue publishing its Student Life college
magazine twice a year but is launching other services to reach
college students. Student Life publisher Jonathan Bulkeley said
marketers will have a chance to advertise in Student Life,
distribute a sample of their products through college bookstores
assembled by Time and give away coupons through posters on campus
or by direct mail.
   ``Stand-alone magazines have a tough time being successful in
this market,'' he said. ``Advertisers are interested in more than
just print.''

   Federal regulators and senators today offered
a cautiously upbeat view of the prospects for a rebound this year
of the nation's banks, which in 1987 suffered their worst year
since the Depression.
   The regulators, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee,
noted two longstanding problems dragging down banking as a whole:
shaky loans to Third World countries and bank failures in
southwestern states whose economies are heavily dependent on oil.
   ``There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of the
currency, Robert Clarke, whose office regulates nationally
chartered banks. ``But they should not overshadow the fact that the
national banking system remains sound.''
   In the troubled southwestern states of Texas, Oklahoma and
Louisiana, which accounted for more than half of the
post-Depression record of 184 bank failures last year, ``the worst
may be over,'' he said.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., agreed that ``the picture this
year is by no means gloomy.'' But he warned that the financial
devastation in Texas could be an indication of what lies ahead if
the national economy turns downward.
   ``What haunts me is that Texas today might be the United States
tomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures bank deposits up to $100,000, said many banks
are prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill effects.
   He added, ``The FDIC fund is adequate to deal with any problems
we can forsee in the banking system in 1988.''
   By any measure, 1987 was a disaster for the nation's 13,650
commercial banks. The industry as a whole recorded a profit of only
$3.7 billion on $3 trillion in assets, the worst performance since
1933.
   The nation's largest banks set aside reserves in anticipation of
losses on loans to Third World countries. Nine of the 10 largest
banks in the nation and 17 of the 25 largest recorded a loss for
the year.
   Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller said
``meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debt
problem.
   ``Leaders in a number of borrowing countries have recognized the
need to restructure their economies,'' he said.
   Seidman, in a trip to San Antonio, Texas, last week said that
Texas banks would hit bottom in 1988 and improve next year. He has
been predicting that bank failures in Texas should climb from 50 in
1987 to 70 this year, but that improvements elsewhere should hold
bank failures nationally to about the same level as last year.
   One substantial, but known, cloud on the horizon is First
Republicbank Corp. of Dallas. In March, the FDIC infused $1 billion
into banks owned by the huge holding company with the idea of
coming up with a permanent rescue package within six months.
   The ailing giant likely will cause the insurance fund, which
stood at $18.3 billion at the end of 1987, to register its first
loss in its 55-year history.
   According to an audit of the FDIC released last month by the
General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress, bank
profits probably will improve despite a continued high level of
bank failures and ``continuing and long-term'' problems presented
by Third World debt.
   Last month, 12 of the 15 largest bank holding companies reported
increased earnings for the first quarter of this year.
   The banking committee hearing today is the second session on the
condition of U.S. financial institutions. The first last week
reviewed the state of savings institutions, where much of Congress'
attention has been focused.
   Compared with banks, the 3,120 federally insured thrifts are in
much worse shape as a whole, posting a $6.8 billion loss last year.
The S&L insurance fund has been hard-pressed to cope with mounting
insolvencies.

<HEAD>SEC Decides Against Action in WPPSS Case, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
decided not to take action against Wall Street underwriters and
others who helped offer Washington Public Power Supply System bonds
that eventually flopped in the biggest municipal bond default ever,
a published report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unidentified sources, said the
commission's report is basically complete, but that it is not
expected to be sent to Congress until the SEC completes a proposal
that would tighten up disclosure in the municipal bond market.
   WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds sold for construction
of two nuclear power plants in Washington state. The plants, WPPSS
Nos. 4 and 5, were abandoned in January 1982 and default occurred
18 months later.
   The Journal's sources said SEC staff had recommended earlier
that the agency take enforcement action against certain parties,
including underwriters.
   But the sources said SEC Chairman David Ruder feared such an
approach would tie up the commission's resources for years in such
a complex case, and that a decision was made against taking
enforcement action.
   Chiles Larson, spokesman for the SEC, told The Associated Press
today he did not expect any official comment on the newspaper
account. He also said he did not know, or could not say, how widely
the investigation's findings to date had been circulated.
   Dennis Fitzgibbons, communications director for the House Energy
Committee, said he had not seen a copy of the investigation report
and could not verify the newspaper story.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the investigations
subcommittee of the House Energy Committee, said he could not
confirm the report.
   ``If these sources are correct, what it does is confirm the old
adage: If you're going to mess up, do it big, because people might
not have the resources to do anything about it. That's if this
report is correct.''
   John Britton, spokesman for WPPSS, said of the published report,
``If that is true, it is good news.''
   In March 1987, WPPSS disclosed that SEC lawyers had informally
advised supply system officials that they planned to recommend the
commission file a civil action against WPPSS for fraud. WPPSS said
at that time it believed it was innocent and would vigorously
defend itself.
   The SEC investigation was reportedly to have been released
earlier this year, and it has become an issue of concern in the
huge federal-court lawsuit filed by bondholders over WPPSS's bond
default. Defendants include WPPSS, utilities that contracted for
the two terminated plants, bond underwriters, attorneys and others.
   Major Wall Street firms that served as underwriters in the
selling of WPPSS bonds agreed last September to settle their part
of the case for $92 million. However, some bondholders have argued
that figure does not adequately reflect the underwriters'
involvement in the alleged fraud, especially if the SEC
investigation finds in favor of enforcement action.
   Trial for the case, dubbed Multi-District Level 551, is
scheduled for Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   Larson said it was unusual that the SEC's investigation had
become public knowledge at all. He said the commission was forced,
by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to disclose subpoenas it
was issuing several years ago in its investigation. Since then, he
said the Supreme Court ruled against the 9th Circuit in the matter,
and the investigation once again gained its mantle of secrecy.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines announced a multibillion
dollar purchase of as many as 100 Boeing 757s today, the second big
order for the aircraft maker this month.
   Under the arrangement, American will acquire 50 757s with an
option to purchase 50 more. American Chairman Robert Crandall would
not disclose a dollar amount, but analysts have said the order is
worth up to $4.2 billion.
   American will take delivery of the planes starting in 1989. They
are primarily designed as replacement airplanes for the aging 737s
and 727s in American's fleet.
   The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range of about 3,200
miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and will
be powered by two Rolls Royce engines.
   ``Overall, this is a transaction that gives American, on
excellent terms, a highly efficient new airplane that can make our
fleet more efficient and productive and allow us to save truly
impressive sums of money in the years ahead,'' Crandall told a news
conference here.
   Analysts have said Seattle-based Boeing Co. could break previous
records in 1988, a decade after the aerospace giant introduced the
twin-engine jetliner. So far this year, Boeing has had 276 aircraft
ordered, compared with just 88 ordered at this time last year.
   The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that Allegis Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, was considering ordering as many as 60
of the 757s, worth an estimated $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion.
   Allegis spokesman Joe Hopkins in Chicago would neither confirm
nor deny such an order was pending, or say whether Allegis was
negotiating with Boeing. ``We simply don't comment on rumors like
that,'' Hopkins said Tuesday.
   So far this year, Boeing has received orders for 40 757s. From
the time Boeing announced development of the plane in 1978 through
the end of 1987, just 239 of the planes had been ordered.
   ``It was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into
its time,'' analyst David Smith of Robert Elsworth and Co. in
Washington, D.C., said Tuesday.
   The company's previous largest order was just last week, a $4.6
billion deal for 100 planes being purchased by International Lease
Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Even with the possibility of 160 additional orders, Boeing
spokesman Jack Gamble said Boeing had no immediate plans to add
workers to its 757 production line at Renton, Wash., or to increase
output from the current four 757s a month. The line has a capacity
of about seven planes a month, Gamble said.
   Any large orders would lengthen the life of the production run
and stabilize work schedules, he said.
   Orders are indicators of future business for Boeing, since the
company isn't paid by customers until planes are delivered.
   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said the American order means the time has come
for an aircraft program ``that was the fly in the ointment'' for
Boeing, he said.
   New orders, he said, may turn ``what has been a continuous-loss
program into what will be a continuous full-production line.''
   Nisbet said the large International Lease order and rush of
interest in the 757 may be the start of a bonanza year for Boeing.
``It may encourage everyone to hurry up and get their place in
line,'' he said, if they want new aircraft delivered before the
mid-1990s.
   Boeing had a record $20.2 billion in commercial jet orders for
1987, but Nisbet said 1988 could see orders reaching $25 billion.
   Boeing intended the 757, which first flew in 1982, as the
eventual replacement for the aging 727 tri-jet, which went into
service in 1964.
   The new plane is quieter than a 727, far more fuel-efficient,
features a computerized cockpit and can be flown by a crew of two,
instead of three. It also costs $41 million to $47 million, which
analysts say was enough to scare away new buyers when the price of
oil fell in the early 1980s.
   ``When fuel went down, it became feasible to operate 727s with
three pilots and big gas-eating engines,'' said William Whitlow,
analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Seattle.
   ``There was not a need to replace 727s that were fully written
off as far as costs were concerned as long as fuel costs were
low,'' Nisbet said. ``But maybe we're seeing that 20-year-old
airplanes are not worth flying'' because of higher maintenance,
fuel and crew costs.
   Both Whitlow and Nisbet said that with airports becoming more
congested, the 757 is attractive because of its passenger capacity.
And Nisbet noted that ``if you want an airplane delivered before
1991'' in the small- to mid-size range, the 757 is the one to pick,
since McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-80, Airbus Industrie's A320 and
Boeing's smaller 737 series ``are all pretty well booked.''
   Boeing does not release profit or loss figures on individual
programs. But Smith, Nisbet and Whitlow all said a new round of
major orders should be enough to make the 757 a money-maker.

   Stock prices continued to edge higher today, but
the market showed no signs of a broad-based rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.80 to 1,969.33 in
the first 2{ hours of trading as trading remained thin.
   Gainers outnumbered losers 9 to 5 in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 803 issues up, 446 down and
519 unchanged.
   Aside from trading related to dividend captures, the volume was
about even with Tuesday's light dealings.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.32 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street, compared to 81.21 million at the same time Tuesday,
when there was heavy dividend-related trading.
   Analysts say the stock market will not make a healthy advance
until volume increases. On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 21.05 points in thin trading.
   Investors have been preoccupied with high interest rates and the
possibility that they could go still higher.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the
corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing
investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding
debt instruments.
   Interest rates may go higher in the short term, but they are
likely to decline in the longer term because it will become
apparent that the economy is not overheating, Neil Eigen, senior
vice president of Integrated Resources Management, said today.
   ``The economy is not booming and rates will not go a lot
higher,'' Eigen said. When rates fall, he said, ``I think stocks
can go a lot higher.''
   In economic news, the government said the merchandise trade
deficit on a balance of payments basis narrowed to $35.95 billion
in the first quarter from $41.19 billion in the fourth quarter.
   Utah Power & Light, which headed the list of most actively
traded issues, was up [ at 30} with more than 4 million shares
traded. Big traders, mainly Japanese, buy the stock to capture its

   West Point-Pepperell was up 4\ to 35|. The company said Farley

   Inspiration Resources Corp. said Wednesday it
had agreed to sell the assets of a copper-mining subsidiary to the
Cyprus Minerals Co. for about $125 million in cash.
   Inspiration said it expects to close the sale of its
Consolidated Copper Co. assets to the Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus
by July 1, and that it intended to apply the net proceeds to retire
all of its current bank debt.
   That action will reduce the company's debt-to-capitalization

percent after the sale,'' said Reuben F. Richards, Inspiration's
chairman.
   The deal is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement and
regulatory approvals, company officials said.

   Officials of the First National Bank of Chicago
say the bank has recovered the last of the nearly $70 million
embezzled in a fund transfer scheme.
   The remaining funds, totaling $19.8 million, were returned by
the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, along with $37,046 in
interest payments, officials said Tuesday.
   The money was transferred electronically May 13, by those
involved in the alleged embezzlement from First National Bank to
accounts of Austrian-based Focobank, at Chase in New York.
   As part of the scheme, an additonal $49 million allegedly was
wired to accounts of another Austrian bank, Creditanstalt, at
Citibank in New York.
   Government prosecutors said Creditanstalt, through Citibank,
previously returned the $49 million.
   Seven men, including two First Chicago employees, were charged
last week with attempting to defraud the bank.
   With the return of the money, First National said it hs dropped
a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Chase,
Focobank and the seven defendants accused of fraud.

<TEXT>
   Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's biggest computer maker, said Wednesday its
consolidated earnings jumped 94.9 percent in its latest fiscal year
while Sony Corp. reported a 46.8 percent earnings gain.
   Fujitsu said it had a profit of 42.1 billion yen, or $336.9
million, in the fiscal year ended March 31, up from 21.6 billion
yen in the previous year.
   Revenue rose 14.4 percent to 2,047 billion yen, or $16.4
billion, from 1,789 billion yen a year earlier.
   Fujitsu's earnings are consolidated to include the results of
overseas subsidiaries and partly owned companies. Dollar totals
were based on an exchange rate of 125 yen to the dollar.
   In addition to making computers, Fujitsu is one of the world's
largest producers of telecommunications systems, semiconductors and
other electronic equipment.
   Sony said its consolidated profit was 36.7 billion yen, or
$293.9 million, in the fiscal year ended March 31, up from 25.0
billion yen in the previous fiscal year.
   Revenue rose 10.5 percent to 1,431 billion yen, or $11.4
billion, from 1,295 billion yen a year earlier.
   Sony said it achieved its stronger results, despite the adverse
effects of the strong yen, through aggressive marketing,
introduction of new products and improvements in its overseas
operations.
   Sony also reported dollar totals on the basis of 125 yen to the
dollar.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said
Wednesday it has begun making computer chips from the biggest
wafers in the industry _ platters that are 8 inches across, or
about the size of a flying disk.
   Most semiconductor manufacturers use wafers that are 4 to 6
inches across. IBM said the bigger wafers permit cost reduction and
higher productivity.
   A wafer is like a pancake that is sliced out of a log of
carefully grown silicon. After being imprinted with circuit
designs, the wafer is diced into individual chips.
   IBM said the 8-inch wafers, now used in volume production in
Essex Junction, Vt., can yield up to 450 chips vs. 150 chips for
the old 5-inch wafers. It is being used on the company's
state-of-the-art million-bit memory chips.

   In addition, Televideo said California Microelectronics Inc.
would have a minority interest in the American half of the
partnership, with Advanced Transducer Devices owning a majority
interest in the firm.
   Televideo Systems had not previously mentioned California
Microelectronics' involvement.
   The Soviets would be represented by V-O Electronorgtechnica, an
electronics trading company.
   Televideo also backed down from a conjecture in a previous press
release that the joint venture, with proper nourishing, could grow
into ``a PC giant, on a par with IBM and Apple.''
   Advanced Transducer Devices, which makes components for personal
computers, had said the joint venture expected to sell at least
4,000 personal computers in the first year. The computers would be
for use in schools, factories and offices, but not the military.
   Televideo said it was optimistic a final agreement would be
reached within the next few months, but it also emphasized that the
transaction remains subject to approval by Advanced Transducer
Devices and Elorg. Actual sales of the computer components are also
subject to U.S. government approval.
   The company, in a news release, said that ATD's sales have
increased from $300,000 in 1985 to $8.6 million through the six
months ended April 30, 1988.
   Advanced Transducer Devices would need an export license from
the Department of Commerce before shipping any computers,
components or technical data.
   In addition, the Department of Defense reviews export
applications for most communist countries to determine if the
product will significantly contribute to the military potential of
the importer. The State Department also makes recommendations to
the Department of Commerce when foreign policy is concerned.

   Chinese first came to Canada as cooks and
launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they're flying in
from Hong Kong with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and
real estate.
   For the large majority, Canada is a hedge against Hong Kong's
reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997.
   While Hong Kong entrepreneurs find easy entry under Canada's
``investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in Toronto and Vancouver
in British Columbia report an increase in the number of Hong Kong
women who come to have babies because the infants automatically
become Canadian citizens.
   Other Chinese come as students and professionals.
   But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome.
   ``They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars ($4
million) for a house because in Hong Kong it would be 20 million
($16 million),'' said Premier David Peterson of Ontario.
   One recent buyer was Stanley Ho, whose casino and ferry empire
in Hong Kong and Macao makes him one of Asia's richest men. He paid
5.5 million Canadian dollars ($4.4 million) for a 25-room mansion
on Bridle Path, Toronto's millionaire's row.
   Across the country in Vancouver, Li Ka-shing, whose companies
represent 20 percent of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, won the
bidding in April for the right to develop the choice 210-acre site
of Expo '86.
   Through his 25-year-old son, Victor, a Canadian citizen, Li
plans to spend $1.6 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into
``Pacific Place,'' a high-rise complex that will consist of a
24-hour global financial center, a 400-room hotel, manmade islands
with 10,000 housing units and a 630-berth marina.
   Li and his son also control 52 percent of Husky Oil Ltd.,
Canada's 12th largest oil company, and his Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp. bought the ailing Bank of British Columbia this past
November.
   Officials estimate the current flow of Chinese investment at
$1.6 billion a year, half of it in real estate. Hong Kong Chinese
own one-third of the shopping malls in the Toronto suburb of
Scarborough, one of three metropolitan Chinatowns.
   Edward Hou, a Canadian-Chinese community leader, said his real
estate company deals with 100 Hong Kong investors a month.
   After the first Chinese came for the gold rush and later to work
on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canada
discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of $50 a head on
new arrivals. Those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947.
   Today, 600,000 Canadians are of Chinese descent, including more
than 200,000 in Toronto and 175,000 in Vancouver.
   At any one time, 18,000 Hong Kong students are enrolled at
Canadian universities.
   Hong Kong has become the leading source of immigrants to Canada,
with 22,100 visas issued last year.
   ``I came in 1967,'' said David Lam, a 65-year-old Vancouver real
estate magnate who has donated more than $5 million to British
Columbia universities and the Sun Yat-sen Classical Chinese Garden
in Vancouver, a replica of the ancient gardens of Suzhou.
   Lam pulled off the biggest real estate deal in Vancouver's
history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for
other Hong Kong investors.
   ``Now we're seeing more than just flight capital,'' Lam said in
an interview. ``There's a second strata of people, young
professionals who see the writing on the wall for Hong Kong and are
afraid.''
   The Chinese Communists have agreed to allow Hong Kong to
maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of
sovereignty, but many Hong Kong Chinese are hedging against that.
   ``Canada is seen as desirable because of its political stability
and large Chinese population.'' said Andrea Eng, a Vancouver
realtor.
   Canada's ``investor immigrant'' program offers a visa in
exchange for investment of 150,000 Canadian dollars ($121,500) to
500,000 dollars ($405,000) in approved businesses.
   Government figures show Hong Kong investment under the program
totaled 776 million Canadian dollars ($628 million) last year and
created 4,500 jobs.
   Premier Peterson of Ontario said he welcomes the well-heeled
arrivals.
   ``Canada has been built by foreign capital _ over 50 percent of
our manufacturing industry is foreign-owned,'' he said.

   Republican George Bush swamped Michael Dukakis
for president in a straw poll of leading entrepreneurs conducted by
Inc. magazine.
   In the survey, conducted Tuesday, Bush captured 77 percent of
the votes, compared with 11 percent favoring the Massachussetts
Democrat, a statement by the magazine said Wednesday.
   Among Republican vice-presidential choices, Howard Baker
captured 23.5 percent of the vote, followed by Bob Dole, at 19.1
percent; Elizabeth Dole, at 15.7 percent; Jack Kemp, at 9.6
percent; and California Governor George Deukmejian, at 8.7 percent.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georga led the list of Democratic vice
presidential favorites, with 32.2 percent of the vote, followed by
former presidential candidate Al Gore, at 20 percent, and Jesse
Jackson, at 10.4 percent, Inc. said.
   The magazine polled about 600 attendees at a conference of past
and present Inc. 500 companies _ those cited as being among the
fastest-growing companies in the nation.
   Valerie Silverman, an Inc. spokeswoman, said 115 of those
attendees responded to the poll.

   Saatchi and Saatchi PLC said Wednesday its

year from a year earlier.
   The British advertising and consulting company said its earnings
totaled 34.6 million pounds, or $65 million, up from 31.2 million

   Revenue rose 9.6 percent to 402.2 million pounds from 367

the pound, mostly against the U.S. dollar.
   Communication interests, which includes advertising, public
relations and marketing, contributed 45.3 million pounds to the
company's operating profit, up from 42.3 million pounds a year

   Operating profit from consulting activities jumped to 8.8
million pounds from 6.3 million pounds.
   The company, which is not required to under British law, did not

   Stock prices were edging higher in thin late
afternoon trading today.
   At 3 p.m., the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
1,973.31, up 10.78.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 874 issues up, 528
down and 510 unchanged.
   Big Board volume, which has been anemic lately, totaled 112.78
million shares as of 2 p.m.
   Analysts said the stock market would not make a healthy advance
until volume increases. On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 21.05 points in thin trading.
   Investors have been preoccupied with high interest rates and the
possibility that they could go still higher.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the
corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing
investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding
debt instruments.
   Utah Power & Light, which headed the list of most actively
traded issues, was up \ at 30~ with more than 4 million shares
traded. Big traders, mainly Japanese, were buying the stock to
capture its dividend and then quickly selling it back.
   West Point-Pepperell was up 4 at 35]. The company said Farley
had filed for federal clearance to acquire between 15 percent and
25 percent of its common shares.
   Tenneco leaped 5\ to 46| after saying it wants to sell its oil
and gas businesses.
   Financial companies advanced across the board. Among actively
traded issues, Citicorp was up | at 23[ and Federal National
Mortgage Association was up 1[ at 38[. Also advancing were Chase
Manhattan, up ~ at 25~; Bank America, up \ to 10], J.P. Morgan, up

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures closed sharply lower Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade after some meteorologists increased the
amount of rain in their forecasts for early next week. Grain
futures prices also fell.
   Technical factors also entered into the fray Wednesday, analysts
said. Attitudes turned bearish after an effort to push the price
for November delivery of soybeans beyond $8.08 a bushel, the
contract's lifetime high, stalled at $8.07.
   A sharp drop in cash prices for Argentine soybean meal also
weighed on the soybean complex, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``But overpowering everything else is the weather,'' he said.
``They are saying there will be more rain early next week than
previously anticipated.''
   Weather has been the dominant factor in the grain and soybean
markets since April, when government reports indicated a large 1988
soybean crop would be needed to prevent a substantial tightening of
supplies.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 8} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.41 a bushel; corn was 2 cents
to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.14} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents
to 3 cents lower with July at $1.72 a bushel; soybeans were 20{
cents to 30 cents lower with July at $7.58 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Kidder, Peabody & Co. denied a published report
Wednesday that it is considering putting some traders on a four-day
work week because of slackened activity on Wall Street.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified Kidder officials as
saying the investment firm might shift some securities traders and
some institutional sales personnel to a shorter work week during
the summer.
   A memo distributed Wednesday to all Kidder employees nationwide
said the Journal's story ``is not true.''
   Kidder Chairman Silas Cathcart and President Max Chapman Jr.
said in the memo that ``at no time has Kidder, Peabody considered
placing professional traders or sales personnel on a four-day work
week.''
   Steve Swartz, the Journal reporter who wrote the story, said he
stood by his story.
   The Journal said the move would save Kidder money by cutting
stock and bond traders' compensation in exchange for the extra day
off.
   The paper said Kidder was considering a plan to operate with at
least some traders on hand at all times while securities markets
are open.
   The Journal said such a move would be highly unusual but
reflected lethargic times on Wall Street since October's stock
market crash.
   Trading volume has been unusually low. On Monday, for example,
only 102.6 million shares traded hands on the New York Stock
Exchange, the lightest level since Thanksgiving. Bond trading also
has tapered off.
   Kidder is a unit of General Electric Corp.

<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 4.5 percent in
April, the biggest advance since November 1986, a real estate trade
group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.48 million units last month, following increases of 2.5
percent in both February and March.
   Economists said increases in mortgage rates late in the month
spurred sales as potential home buyers jumped into the market out
of concern that rates would go higher.
   The April increase in sales was accompanied by a slight drop in
prices, which fell by $200 to $87,700 compared to March. However,
the resale price of a home was still 2 percent higher than a year
ago, when the median price of a home was $86,000.
   In the Northeast, sales rose 6.2 percent from March to April to
an annual rate of 690,000 units. Sales were up 5.7 percent in the
South to an annual rate of 1.3 million units while the Midwest had
a 2.3 percent increase in sales to an annual rate of 900,000.
   The West was the only region of the country to have a decline in
sales, a drop of 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 560,000 units.

   The stock market closed mixed today in quiet
trading.
   Analysts said traders remained paralyzed, acknowledging that
recent corporate earnings have been stronger than expected, yet
fearful that interest rates could easily head higher.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the
corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing
investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding
debt instruments.
   Traders' reluctance to act has meant that volume has been
particularly slow lately.
   Today's activity continued that trend, notable exceptions being
interest-sensitive issues, such as banks and insurance companies,
which showed healthy gains, and several other stocks related to
real or potential takeover moves or _ to a lesser extent _
dividend-recapture strategies.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business failures declined by 10.1 percent in
the first quarter over a year ago as more farmers and retailers
climbed out of the red, a report released Wednesday said.
   Dun & Bradstreet Corp., a business-information concern, said
15,211 businesses nationwide went under during the first three
months of this year, compared with 16,924 in 1987.
   Joseph W. Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's chief economist, said 75
percent of the improvement was due to a decline in failures in the
agriculture and retailing sectors.
   First-quarter retailing failures slipped 17 percent, to 2,918
from 3,515, while agriculture failures plunged 53 percent, to 596
from 1,266.
   ``The strong levels of consumer demand that characterized the
early years of the current economic expansion also resulted in a
high level of entrepreneurial activity in retailing,'' Duncan said.
   He attributed the improvement in the agriculture sector to the
introduction of Chapter 12 into the federal bankruptcy laws.
Chapter 12 protects farmers from their creditors while allowing
them to reorganize.
   Other large declines in business failures included: mining, down
53 percent; transportation and public utilities, down 13.2 percent;
manufacturing, down 11.1 percent; and construction, down 9.8
percent, Dun & Bradstreet said.
   By region, the West-South-Central states _ Texas, Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Louisiana _ fared the best, with business failures
down nearly 30 percent. But the South Atlantic states _ New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania _ had a 68 percent jump in failures.
   ``Until further data are available in 1988, it will be difficult
to tell if the trend in New York and New Jersey is somehow linked
to the October (stock market) crash,'' Duncan said.

<HEAD>AT&T Confirms It Is Reevaluating Relationship With Olivetti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. confirmed
Wednesday it is reevaluating aspects of its relationship with Ing.
C. Olivetti & Co. SpA, the Italian partner that builds its personal
computer line.
   AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen said Tuesday in Madrid that the
company may curtail purchases of Olivetti personal computers and
may seek another supplier.
   Allen, speaking at a news luncheon, also said the company plans
to take ``direct'' management control of its foreign operations.
   The remarks were reported Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal
and confirmed by AT&T.
   But AT&T spokeswoman Marj McKean said AT&T expects to
strengthen, not weaken, its ties with Olivetti. ``Both sides are
looking at the arrangement with a hard business eye, but a
reassessment does not automatically mean a change,'' she added.
   Olivetti currently sells AT&T minicomputers and phone switches
in Europe. Ms. McKean said she could not confirm whether Allen's
mention about taking direct management control referred to the
Olivetti relationship.
   Allen said the Olivetti review was prompted in part by changes
in currency-exchange rates and the two companies' product
portfolios, according to the Journal.
   AT&T owns 22.3 percent of Olivetti's stock. There were reports
of discord between the companies earlier this year after they
reportedly could not agree on terms for AT&T to boost its stake in
the Italian company.
   Vittorio Cassoni, hired away from Olivetti to head AT&T's
computer operations, recently returned to Olivetti as managing
director. Robert M. Kavner, the new head of AT&T's Data Systems
Group, was elected last week as an Olivetti director.
   Ms. McKean said Cassoni's return to Olivetti could help the
relationship. ``Cassoni has a clear vision of what we're doing here
and he understands our needs, and he takes that with him to
Olivetti,'' she said.

   The stock market closed mixed Wednesday, after
another day of slow trading that was punctuated by heightened
activity in selected issues.
   At the bell, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
1,961.37, down 1.16 points.
   Advancing stocks outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
809 issues up, 633 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 138.31 million shares,
down from 139.93 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
162.10 million shares.
   Even though the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 21.05
points on Tuesday, analysts said at the start of Wednesday's
session that, until volume picked up, there would be little reason
to expect a lasting upward move.
   They were right.
   ``The market is in a gridlock, supported by strong earnings on
the bottom, and fear of high interest rates on the top,'' observed
Robert H. Stovall, president of the Stovall@Twenty-First Advisers,
Inc. securities firm.
   High interest rates hurt Wall Street by cutting into the
corporate profits that support stock prices, and by causing
investors to take money from stocks and put it into high-yielding
debt instruments.
   One exception Wednesday was the strength that developed in
interest-sensitive stocks.
   Many financial institutions advanced on expectations that higher
interest rates will expand their profitability, said Eugene Peroni,
director of technical research, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., in
Philadelphia.
   Citicorp closed was up \ at 22} and Federal National Mortgage
Association was up 1[ at 38[. Also advancing were American Express,
up \ at 24; Bank America, up [ to 10\, J.P. Morgan, up ~ to 35{,
and Chemical Bank, up | to 27}.
   Another reason for the gains, however, may have been that
traders were feeling the stocks were selling too cheaply, Stovall
said.
   Also leading the market were stocks that were related to real,
rumored or potential takeover activity.
   West Point-Pepperell closed up 4 at 35]. The company said Farley
had filed for federal clearance to acquire between 15 percent and
25 percent of its common shares.
   Tenneco leaped 4] to 45} after saying it wants to sell its oil
and gas businesses.
   Upjohn was third on the NYSE's most-active list, up 2[ to 31\,
while Rorer Group, another drug company, was up 3 at 31}.
   ``There were rumors that Du Pont is looking for a pharmaceutical
company, and that pushed them higher,'' Peroni said.
   Utah Power & Light, led the list of most actively traded issues,
closing ] higher at 31, with 4.1 million shares traded. Big
traders, mainly Japanese, bought the stock to capture its dividend
and then quickly selling it back.
   The NYSE index was up 0.24 at 143.77.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 0.08 to 293.57,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.25 at 253.76.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.06
to 290.58. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 365.73, up 0.57.
   The market value of all U.S. stocks rose $3.83 billion, or 0.15
percent from Tuesday, according to the Wilshire Associates Equity
Index, which measures NYSE, American and over-the-counter issues.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
in quiet trading Wednesday and gold gave back its gains of recent
sessions.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $453.75
a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $459.20 an ounce late
Tuesday.
   The recent stability of exchange rates encouraged
foreign-exchange dealers to move their money into high-yielding
currencies, such as Australian and New Zealand dollars, and out of
low-yielding currencies such as the West German mark and Swiss
franc, traders said.
   ``The low-interest-rate currencies are out of favor,'' said
Robert Hatcher, a corporate trader for Barclays Bank in New York.
   The market showed little reaction to a report that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit on a balance-of-payments basis fell to
$35.9 billion in the first quarter of 1988 from $41.2 billion at
the end of 1987. The decline was expected, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed little changed at 124.30 yen, up
0.05 yen. In later London trading, it was quoted at 124.40 yen. At
the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar rose to 124.42
yen from 124.18 late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8650 from $1.8680 late
Tuesday. Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.8631 from $1.8673
late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in late New York trading, compared with rates
late Tuesday, included: 1.7064 West German marks, up from 1.7007;
1.4238 Swiss francs, up from 1.4196; 1.2427 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.2417; 5.7583 French francs, up from 5.7420; and 1,265.38
Italian lire, up from 1,262.03.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's rates,
included: 1.4245 Swiss francs, up from 1.4150; 5.7550 French
francs, up from 5.7395; 1.9090 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9030;
1,264.50 Italian lire, up from 1,261.80; 1.2434 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.2412.
   Gold prices fell in Europe and then followed suit in New York.
Prices were pulled down by a drop in the price of platinum and by
reports of a major gold sale, possibly by an Australian mine, said
Michael Mikolay, chief bullion dealer for Rhode Island Hospital
Trust National Bank in Providence, R.I.
   In Hong Kong, before the European sell-off, gold fell 42 cents a
troy ounce to close at a bid $460.27 an ounce.
   In Zurich, the late bid price for gold was $454.50, down from
$458 late Tuesday.
   The late bid price for gold in London was $454 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $457.75. At the end of the trading day,
gold bullion for current delivery fell to $454.40 a troy ounce on
the Commodity Exchange in New York, down from $460.60 an ounce late
Tuesday.
   Silver was quoted at a bid price of $6.67 a troy ounce in
London, down from late Tuesday's price of $6.71. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $6.592 a troy
ounce from $6.754 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Suchard Seeks Friendly Merger With Rowntree</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf to CORRECT $3.9 billion to $3.7 billion.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard SA on
Wednesday offered 2.1 billion pounds, or $3.9 billion, for Rowntree
PLC if the British confectioner agrees to a friendly merger.
   But Suchard, which just received British government approval to
purchase up to 29.9 percent of Rowntree, said it would launch a
hostile bid if its amicable approach failed.
   The announcement came immediately after the British government
also cleared a competing hostile offer from Swiss foods giant
Nestle SA.
   The approvals came in the form of a decision by Trade Secretary
Lord Young not to refer Nestle's bid and Suchard's stake to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   Rowntree Chairman Kenneth Dixon said he was disappointed that
the government failed to call for an investigation into Nestle's
bid because of the ``important public issues to be considered.''
   Dixon said Rowntree remains firmly opposed to Nestle's bid,
which he said fails to reflect the true value of the company.
Rowntree makes the internationally popular Kit Kat candy bars and
After Eight chocolates, among other products.
   Rowntree did not comment on whether it would meet with Suchard.
   Nestle, which holds about 16 percent of Rowntree's 224 million
outstanding shares, said it was pleased the government will allow
it to pursue its $16.64-a-share bid. While that bid values Rowntree
at about $3.7 billion, Nestle has said it would cost $3.9 billion
to complete the acquisition.
   Suchard Vice President Walter Anderau said his company was
``seeking a fundamentally different form of cooperation with
Rowntree. If that doesn't succeed, then we'll make a full bid.''
   Suchard, a Zurich-based company with interests in chocolate and
coffee, said it is seeking a recommendation from the Rowntree board
of directors for a possible cash offer $17.58 a share, or for other
means of joining the two companies' confectionery businesses.
   Lord Young said a full bid from Suchard would need government
clearance.
   The Swiss companies' bids for Rowntree, dubbed the ``candy bar
wars,'' have sparked controversy in Britain over whether Rowntree
should remain in British hands. The takeover target and members of
Parliament pressured the Conservative government to refer the bid
to the monopolies commission.
   But Lord Young said Wednesday that in deciding whether to refer
a bid, ``we look mainly at the effect on competition in the United
Kingdom. These proposals raise no competition issues.''
   He noted that Nestle and Suchard currently control 3 percent and
2 percent respectively of the British chocolate market.
   Critics claim it is unfair for Swiss companies, which are
protected from takeovers by foreign firms, to bid for British
companies that do not operate under the same protection.
   Opposition lawmaker Doug Henderson noted that ``people are now
very worried.'' He said it seems Rowntree is among the first
casualties in the ``battle for 1992.''
   The Common Market intends to abolish all internal trade barriers
to create a single European market of 320 million consumers by 1992.
   Earlier this month, the government cleared U.S..-based General
Cinema Corp.'s acquisition of a 17.7 percent stake in Cadbury
Schweppes PLC.
   General Cinema, which has announced that it doesn't any longer
consider its stake in Cadbury to be a passive investment, said
Wednesday it increased its stake to 18.4 percent.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Sink As Inflation Signals Weaken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices fell broadly Wednesday on
profit-taking as fears of inflation eased and the dollar gained
strength against other currencies.
   On other markets, soybean futures plummeted and prices retreated
for an array of commodities, including grains, cotton, livestock
and meat, oils and stock-index futures.
   Prices for future delivery of platinum, which has led the
precious-metals complex in posting impressive gains this month,
dropped $11.20 per troy ounce across the board on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   The platinum contract for delivery in July settled at $579.40 a
troy ounce. July platinum rose from $515 a troy ounce at the
beginning of this month to a high of $597.50 at one point during
Tuesday's session.
   Analysts said the dollar's gains, declining commodity prices and
nervousness about Thursday's government report on the gross
national product all contributed to the fall in precious metals
prices.
   ``Mainly, there's some uncertainty as to what the GNP number is
going to be,'' said Andrea Gould, director of investments for the
Platinum Guild International in New York. ``Whenever there is
uncertainty and there are profits to be taken, they'll take their
profits.''
   The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a rough
indicator of inflation, fell sharply Wednesday, which spurred
further selling of precious metals futures, analysts said.
   Nevertheless, many technical and fundamental factors suggest
platinum, gold and silver will continue to rally, analysts said.
   ``I would categorize this as a normal correction following a
meteoric advance in platinum since the beginning of the month,''
said Bernard Savakl, an analyst in New York with PaineWebber Inc.
``Nothing goes straight up like a rocket.''
   Savakl noted that warehouse stocks of gold at the Commodity
Exchange in New York fell about 185,000 troy ounces Wednesday to a
10{-year low of about 1.224 million ounces. The physical tightness
is supportive for the gold market and ``could be a prelude to an
explosive upside move this summer,'' he said.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $6.20 to $7.50 lower
with June at $454.80 a troy ounce; silver was 16.2 cents to 18.2
cents lower with May at $6.592 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade after some meteorologists increased the amount of rain in
their forecasts for early next week.
   Technical factors also entered into the fray, analysts said.
Attitudes turned bearish after an effort to push the price for
November delivery of soybeans beyond $8.08 a bushel, the contract's
lifetime high, stalled at $8.07.
   A sharp drop in cash prices for Argentine soybean meal also
weighed on the soybean complex, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``But overpowering everything else is the weather,'' he said.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a
six-to-10-day forecast calling for normal to above-normal rainfall
in the Midwest during the second half of next week.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 8{ cents lower with July at $3.41\ a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.14} a
bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower with July at $1.72 a
bushel; soybeans were 21{ cents to 30 cents lower with July at
$7.59 a bushel.
   Cotton futures, which are also weather-sensitive, posted steep
losses on the New York Cotton Exchange. The July contract settled
1.10 cents lower at 65.07 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on expectations of a temporary slowdown in wholesale meat
demand.
   ``People are a little worried that the bulk of buying for the
holiday weekend is pretty much done,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .65 cent lower with June at
71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .75 cent lower
with May at 80.95 cents a pound; hogs were .60 cent lower to .02
cent higher with June at 52.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent to 1.05 cents lower with July at 53.22 cents a pound.
   Oil futures finished nearly unchanged in dull trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 1
cent higher with July at $17.37 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent
lower to .06 cent higher with June at 47.31 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .13 cent to .25 cent lower with June at 51.72
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .25 point lower at 255.80.

<HEAD>American Airlines Orders Up To 100 Boeing Jets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines announced Wednesday it
would buy up to 100 Boeing 757-200s to replace aging aircraft in
its fleet, giving the Seattle aerospace company its second
multibillion-dollar order in as many weeks.
   American officials said they were ordering 50 757s for delivery
between July 1989 and November 1991, with an option to purchase 50
more. The deal could be worth more than $4 billion to Boeing.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said the
order substantiates Boeing's belief in a plane that had been a slow
seller since its launch a decade ago.
   ``I think most of you know that we've been probably a little
disappointed with the 757 over the years,'' Thornton said.
   ``The purchase and thereby the endorsement of the product by an
airline like American is going to be a real boost to Boeing and a
real boost to what we think is going to be a mainstay ... in the
domestic and international markets,'' he said.
   American executives said exact cost figures were proprietary,
but Robert W. Baker, American's vice president for operations, said
the order was on ``very favorable terms for American,'' with the
first 50 jets costing just over $2 billion, and the second 50 about
the same.
   Analyst Wolfgang Demisch at Union Bank of Switzerland in New
York said ``American got a very good deal'' at a price of roughly
$40 million a plane. Depending on configuration, 757s normally sell
for $41 million to $47 million each.
   Industry analysts say Boeing could be headed for its fourth
straight year of record orders, topping 1987's $20.2 billion.
Boeing has had orders for 326 aircraft so far this year, compared
with 366 ordered for all of 1987.
   Wednesday's announcement follows a May 16 firm order by
International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., for 100
Boeing aircraft with options for 24 more. At $4.6 billion for the
124 planes, the ILFC deal was a record for Boeing.
   Several newspapers have reported that Allegis Corp., parent of
United Airlines, is considering ordering up to 60 757s worth an
estimated $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, possibly this week. Both
Allegis and Boeing officials have declined to comment on the
reports.
   American canceled an order to buy 15 757s in 1982 because of
poor economic conditions, and Thornton said Boeing has been talking
with American about buying the new jet since.
   Baker said American's new jets will primarily replace aging
Boeing 737s and 727s in its fleet. The 194-passenger 757 jetliner,
with a range of about 3,300 miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than
comparable aircraft and will be powered by two Rolls Royce engines.
   The 50 additional planes, if ordered, would be delivered through
December 1993. In an interview with The Seattle Times last week,
American Chairman Robert Crandall said it was possible American
could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century.
   Boeing introduced the 757 in 1978 as a high-tech, fuel-stingy
replacement for its 727 tri-jet, which went into service in 1964.
But a drop in fuel prices and airline deregulation stalled sales.
Just 239 of the jets were ordered through the end of 1987.
   So far this year, however, 90 757s have been ordered. Analysts
say higher maintenance costs for older planes, tougher airport
noise restrictions and airport congestion have brought the plane
new popularity.
   ``It was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow into
its time,'' analyst David Smith of Robert Elsworth and Co. in
Washington, D.C., said Tuesday.
   Thornton said Boeing planned to increase 757 production at its
Renton plant from four a month at present to five a month sometime
next year. However, he said, Boeing did not expect to need to hire
many new workers.
   Crandall said American chose Rolls-Royce engines for the 757
because of what he called its superior reliability over comparable
Pratt & Whitney models available. He said Pratt & Whitney undertook
a vigorous competition to gain the order but ``Rolls simply
prevailed.''

<HEAD>Sugarman Reportedly Loses Bid For Media General Board Slate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burt Sugarman, who earlier this year
launched a $1.8 billion takeover bid for Media General Inc.,
appears to have lost his attempt to capture three of its board
seats, the company said Wednesday.
   Preliminary results from Friday's shareholders vote show the
incumbent management nominees received more than 56 percent of the
vote, compared to 42.6 percent for Sugarman's proposed slate, Media
General President James S. Evans said in a statement.
   Evans said Media General got the early results by telephone
Wednesday afternoon from Corporation Trust Co. He said the election
inspection company told him 86 percent of Media General's total
outstanding 28 million Class A shares voted, with the incumbents
receiving 13.5 million votes and Sugarman's ticket of himself,
Harold Simmons and David Gotterer getting just under 10.3 million
votes.
   Sugarman, in responding to the Media General announcement, noted
his slate's vote total and said, ``We fully expect that Media
General's management and their board of directors will respect the
opinion of this large group of shareholders and initiate action
that will maximize shareholder value.''
   Sugarman was referring to his battle for management acceptance
for his $70-a-share bid for Media General.
   Evans said a final report on the vote would not be made until
both sides have had an opportunity to inspect shareholder proxies
and to raise any questions with Corporation Trust.
   The family of Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan owns 71
percent of the company's controlling Class B shares, which
represent seven of the 10 board seats.
   Sugarman, a California-based investor with 10 percent of Media
General's Class A holdings, launched the takeover bid in February
with a $61.50-per-share offer that he later boosted to $70.
Subsequently, he and two associates challenged three
Bryan-supported directors seeking re-election to the board's three
Class A seats.
   In the weeks leading up to Friday's shareholders meeting,
lawyers for both sides went to court seeking injunctions to stop
the opposition from delivering what they characterized as false and
misleading information to shareholders about the proxy battle.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams denied both parties'
motions, saying the proper time to file them would be after the
annual meeting.
   Media General owns several daily newspapers, including the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and Richmond News Leader, as well as
several weekly papers, television stations and cable operations.
   Sugarman is the chairman and chief executive officer of Barris
Industries Inc., a producer of television programs, and Giant Group
Ltd., whose holdings including cement businesses.

   Litton Industries Inc. reported
that its third-quarter profit rose 22 percent from a year earlier.
   The industrial giant said Wednesday that it earned $42 million,
or $1.60 a share, in its third quarter ended April 30, up from
$34.3 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier.
   Litton's businesses include defense systems, electronics and
industrial automation.
   Sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, up from $1.15
billion in the same period a year earlier.
   In the first nine months of its current fiscal year, Litton
earned $123.3 million, or $4.67 a share, up 20 percent from
earnings of $102.7 million, or $3.83 a share, a year earlier. Sales
for the first nine months were $3.55 billion, up from $3.19 billion.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Shareholders Accept Anti-Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp. shareholders on Wednesday
accepted an anti-takeover defense suggested by management and
rejected a stockholder's request to dismantle another anti-takeover
provision.
   A majority of shareholders voted at their annual meeting to
stagger the terms of company directors so a hostile buyer would
have to wait at least two years to elect a majority to the board of
the nation's sixth-largest retailer.
   Under the plan, one-third of Dayton Hudson directors will be
elected each year to three-year terms, instead of all directors
standing for re-election every year, the company announced.
   Shareholders also rejected a request by the College Retirement
Equities Fund of New York City, a large pension fund, to put Dayton
Hudson's ``poison pill'' plan to a shareholder vote. Directors
adopted the poison pill, which allows more stock to be issued
during a hostile takeover, in September 1986.
   Richard M. Schlefer, an investment officer with the fund, said
the poison pill allows directors to block a hostile offer that
could be beneficial to shareholders.
   Dayton Hudson Chairman Kenneth Macke opposed Schlefer's motion
and defended the poison pill as a useful bargaining tool in
takeover situations.
   Dayton Hudson was the target of a $6.62 billion takeover attempt
last year by Dart Group Corp. Dart's bid failed in the wake of the
October stock market crash.
   Macke told shareholders management will dedicate itself to
making bigger profits and restoring its reputation on Wall Street.
   Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson has experienced a drop in annual
profits two years in a row and earnings were down in the first
quarter of 1988.
   Macke said earnings should grow by at least 15 percent this year.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An understanding has been reached in a
$59 million deal that would create an independent railroad owned by
former employees of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad,
officials said Wednesday.
   Under the deal, CSX Transportation and the Railway Labor
Executive's Association would buy P&LE's business and some of its
assets, said John W. Snow, president and chief operating officer of
CSX Transportation, one of the nation's largest freight railroads.
   CSX Transportation is a subsidiary of CSX Corp., which is also
involved in energy, technology and real estate. CSX Transportation,
based in Jacksonville, operates 21,000 route miles of railroad in
the eastern half of the United States and the province of Ontario,
Canada.
   ``While we have reached this understanding, there are
significant issues yet to be resolved,'' Snow said. He did not
specify what the issues are.
   The plan calls for the business to be operated by a new company
that will buy nearly all of P&LE's right-of-way and about 1,700
freight cars for $59 million. The purchase will be financed by CSX
Transportation.
   Completion of the deal depends on approval by local labor
groups, the CSX board of directors and the Interstate Commerce
Commission.

<HEAD>Jacobs Group Sweetens Offer To Take Minstar Private</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group led by takeover
specialist Irwin Jacobs on Wednesday sweetened its offer to take
Minstar Inc. private.
   Jacobs' group, I.J. Holdings Corp., said it is offering $26.50
in cash and a $5 note for each of Minstar's 11.4 million
outstanding common shares, giving the deal a value of about $400
million if all shares are tendered.
   The group, which owns 56 percent of Minstar's stock, would leave
about 1.3 million shares in the company as equity, said Ken
Severinson, Minstar president. The tender offer is expected to
begin June 2.
   Minstar is a diversified company that consists of several boat
manufacturers, other sporting goods businesses and Bekins Co.
   The deal has the backing of an independent committee of
Minstar's board of directors, which negotiated an increase in the
$29-a-share leveraged buyout which Jacobs proposed last month,
according to Robin Young, director of research at the Minneapolis
investment firm John G. Kinnard & Co.
   In a leveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the
target company with sales of the target's assets or from its cash
flow.
   Jacobs, the chairman of Minstar, owns about a third of the
company's shares, which are worth more than $122 million under the
terms of the offer.
