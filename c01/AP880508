<HEAD>Social Democrats Win Majority in Schleswig-Holstein Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Democratic Party gained a
firm victory in Schleswig-Holstein state Sunday, ending 38 years of
rule by the conservative Christian Democrats.
   The special election was called after a ``dirty-tricks scandal''
rocked the state government last year.
   Bjoern Engholm, leader of the state's Social Democrats, and his
supporters had failed to win a majority in elections last September.
   But on Sunday, projections said the Social Democrats won 54
percent of the vote, assuring the party of 46 of the 74 seats in
the legislature and that Engholm would be governor.
   The Christian Democrats were projected to receive about 33
percent, a loss of eight percent from September.
   Engholm was the target of a smear campaign last year involving
allegations of improper sexual conduct. The campaign was blamed on
then-Gov. Uwe Barschel, who was found dead in a Geneva hotel in
October. Authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide.
   Projected results also showed the Free Democratic Party, which
was allied with the Christian Democrats in the state's coalition
government, had failed to receive the necessary five percent of the
vote to stay in the legislature and lost its four seats.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Sunday night that the
Social Democrats' victory would not negatively affect his
conseravative coalition in the federal government with the Free
Democrats.
   He attributed the Social Democrats' victory to the Barschel
affair.
   ``We went into the election from an unusually difficult
position,'' Kohl said.
   Last September, neither party could win enough seats to form a
majority and elect a new governor.
   Barschel remained in office but then resigned when one of his
aides disclosed details about the smear campaign against Engholm in
late September.
   The Christian Democrats had entered Heiko Hoffmann, the state's
justice minister, to run against Engholm in Sunday's balloting.

   Build a better cage for an egg to crash in and
the world may not beat a path to your door, but it won't scramble
your eggs, either.
   And it could help your physics grade at South Terrebonne High
School, says physics teacher Paul Johnson, whose 75 students at
Friday's Egg Drop Competition used principles of mass, inertia,
acceleration _ and toothpicks.
   The idea: build toothpick frames to cradle an egg during a
20-foot free fall, distribute the shock of a crash-landing and keep
the egg from breaking.
   More than six dozen eggs didn't make the grade, including
Johnson's, which splattered when its shapeless case hit the ground
and smashed into, ah, toothpicks.
   ``I got the design from my friend in New York,'' Johnson said.
``It worked for him. But I changed it up a little. I guess I should
have stuck with the original design.''
   Sixteen-year-old junior Casey Portier's egg made it through its
first drop into the center of a spherical array of interconnected
triangles.
   ``Everyone was dropping theirs and it was flipping over and
breaking,'' he said. ``I used symmetry so the weight was
distributed evenly.''
   Laurie Ledet, 17, a senior, was less systematic. Her project
looked like a bent soda can with a crown on top. Nonetheless, it
worked.
   On Casey's second drop, the ball began to roll. It bounced off
the pavement and the egg began to ooze. Laurie's egg survived a
second drop with a cracked shell, but the egg stayed inside.
   ``Well,'' said Johnson, ``it looks like it's going to be easy to
distribute the awards.''

   Godzilla has been found.
   The 30-foot balloon dinosaur disappeared Saturday from the roof
of hardware store in this southwestern Michigan community shortly
after it was inflated.
   No rampages were reported in the surrounding countryside, and
the thieves returned the creature early Sunday to the home of the
store's owner, said Mike Cammarata, owner of the rental company
that provided the beast.
   ``I'm real pleased about it,'' he said. ``That thing's worth
$7,800.''
   Cammarata suspected pranksters from nearby Pinckney High School,
but the suspects remain unknown. While it was gone, the creature
``made a mess of San Francisco, but that's about it,'' he said.

   A 48-year-old athletic trainer says he's
giving up his goal of outrunning a horse even though he has lost by
only a few minutes in two 50-mile races against an Arabian stallion.
   Bill Misner of Spokane reached the finish, designated as the
first stoplight in Colville, just four minutes behind Zeke, ridden
by Becky Farrington.
   ``I wanted him so bad, you can't believe it,'' Misner said.
   Misner completed the grueling course in six hours, 44 minutes
and 47 seconds after leaving the start in Deer Park.
   Last year, Misner lost to Zeke by six minutes.
   He said he decided to try to outrun a horse after watching an
NBC-TV program called ``Sports Fantasies.''
   ``I thought, `Well golly, that would be interesting to race
against a horse because Jesse Owens did that,''' he said.
   After the two attempts, he said, he's decided to give up the
challenge. Parts of his race against Zeke will be shown May 22 on
``Sports Fantasies.''

   A month before he killed himself, Vincent van
Gogh painted a portrait in blue of his innkeeper's young daughter.
   The girl, Adeline Ravoux, 13, was on the terrace of the cafe in
Auvers, a village outside Paris, when the artist returned from the
fields, his hands pressed to the bullet wound in his stomach. Two
days later, July 29, 1890, van Gogh died. He was 37 years old.
   On Wednesday, ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' will offered for
sale at an auction of impressionist and modern paintings.
Christie's, the auction house, estimates that it will fetch more
than $15 million.
   Experts say interest in the portrait is keen in part because of
the story behind it.
   The adolescent girl who posed for the painting said in an essay
published in 1956 that she considered it ``somewhat of a
disappointment'' at first. But in her later years, Adeline Ravoux
Carrie said she finally came to appreciate its insight into her
character.
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who always smoked a pipe and enjoyed
playing with her little sister.
   She also recalled the last two days of the artist's life during
which he slowly succumbed to the fatal bullet.
   A doctor came to dress the wound, police officers arrived to
investigate the suicide and the artist's brother Theo arrived
running from the train station, his face ``distorted by grief,''
she wrote.
   The portrait being auctioned Wednesday is one of three versions
van Gogh painted. When last offered for sale, in 1980 at Sotheby's,
it brought $1.98 million from an anonymous buyer.
   Last year, three of van Gogh's paintings fetched record
multimillion- dollar prices that shocked the art world. The artist
sold almost nothing during his lifetime.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese firm, Yasuda Fire & Marine
Insurance Co. Three months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went
for $20.2 million, also at Christie's in London. It was bought by
an unidentified collector living in Switzerland.
   Then in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises'' _
a richly-colored composition of purple flowers and green leaves set
off by a single white iris _ sold at Sotheby's in New York for
$53.9 million to an anonymous buyer. It was the highest price paid
at auction for any painting.
   John Rewald, the author of ``Post-Impressionism: From van Gogh
to Gauguin,'' has said of ``Irises'': ``If a museum could have one
painting by van Gogh, that's what it should get.''
   Michael Findlay, Christie's senior vice president, said he
didn't think ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' would bring anywhere
near the price paid for ``Irises.''
   The special appeal of the portrait, aside from the painting
itself, is its link to van Gogh's last days, said Findlay.
   In the painting, Adeline, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a
chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is
serene, her posture correct and her hands folded demurely in front
of her.
   ``He observed her very deeply, and when he came to paint her, he
painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent
girl,'' Findlay said. He used ``brief flashing strokes'' and
``astonishing'' color; the background is ``almost an electric blue,
a night blue,'' he said.
   Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at age 88, had written: ``I admit
that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait; it was
somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to
life.'' But she also told an interviewer, ``Monsieur Vincent
divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.''
   Van Gogh gave the first of his three versions of the portrait to
the Ravoux family. More lifelike and detailed than the version up
for auction, it is now in a private collection in Switzerland. A
third version that shows only the face and whose colors are less
brilliant is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art.

   Soap opera actors say their characters have
started speaking ``See Dick run,'' Johnny Carson is actually tired
of time off and Bruce Willis has taken up gardening as a
scriptwriters strike enters week nine.
   Talks are suspended between the Writers Guild of America and the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers following the
WGA's walkout March 7 over residuals and creative control.
   And there's no relief in sight, with producer Stephen Cannell,
who's also a member of the guild, saying things could drag on until
January.
   ``The Writers Guild is a very militant union,'' Academy
Award-winning writer Dan Taradash said Friday. ``We believe in what
we believe.''
   Taradash, a former guild president and former president of the
Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences, said the strike forced
him to stop work on a nearly completed script about Polish labor
leader Lech Walesa.
   A sequel to the movie ``Annie'' also reportedly has been
orphaned by the strike. ``Annie II,'' planned for a Christmas
release, couldn't get final touches made on its script.
   CBS, which had hoped for a comeback in the fall after an
unprecedented third-place finish this season, announced April 28
that it would push back the start of the new season from early
Septeber to late October at the earliest.
   Producers claim the strike has cost the industry more than $15
million in lost jobs and production time, with about 1,400 clerical
workers, cast and crew members laid off.
   The union struck when producers wanted to reformulate residual
payments for hour-long television shows sold into syndication.
Producers claim the shows are not selling well. Writers also want
an increase of residuals from foreign markets, and more control
over changes in their scripts.
   After nine weeks of reruns, Carson returns Wednesday, writing
his own monologue and otherwise ad-libbing his one-hour NBC show.
   Carson's contract allowing him generous time off has been the
subject of ``Tonight Show'' joking from time to time. But the
strike-forced vacation became no laughing matter, Carson said, with
longtime workers in his production company facing layoffs.
   Through a spokesman, Carson said that he was frustrated with
efforts to reach an independent contract with the guild that would
permit his scriptwriters to return.
   Talks with Carson and at least 80 other independent producers
are continuing. Scriptwriters voted April 14 not to grant
independent contracts until it had a number of them in hand to
avoid the divisiveness of only a few members returning to work.
   Arthur Sellers, a member of the guild negotiating committee,
said Friday that it was possible the membership ``may decide to
move ahead and sign independent contracts this month.''
   Meanwhile, the daytime soap operas have continued production.
   ``Scab scripts ain't fun,'' said actress Norma Connolly, who
plays Aunt Ruby on ``General Hospital.'' ``They make our days long
and hard. They're illiterate,'' she said Wednesday as she walked a
picket line with the guild.
   ``You have to continue,'' said Jerry Balme, one of the show's
producers. ``You owe it to the audience and to the network,'' he
said, adding: ``We miss (the writers). We want them back.''
   The writing is ``getting to look like `See Dick run,''' said
actress Peggy McCary of ``Days of Our Lives.''
   Labor-management relations can be unusual in Hollywood. Striking
scriptwriter Robert Goethals said he is surviving on tuna fish
sandwiches and loans from friends, who also happen to be producers.
   Producer Cannell, also a member of the Writers Guild, honors the
strike and stays away from his typewriter.
   ``Since I was a writer first, I'm not going to scab during the
strike,'' Cannell said. But he feels a conflict.
   ``I don't think it's going to settle on the Writers Guild terms
no matter what they think. I think it could go on to January if the
wrong set of philosophies get used ... if they keep saying the
companies are getting fat.''
   Like many other producers, Cannell has cut paychecks in half as
a means of keeping on staff. Cannell Productions turns out such
television series as ``Hunter,'' ``The A-Team,'' ``Hardcastle &
McCormick'' and ``The Rockford Files.''
   Meanwhile, ``Moonlighting'' star Bruce Willis has taken up
gardening. His ABC-TV series shut down early because of a lack of
scripts.
   Though he's not at work, Willis still has his problems.
   ``I'm having a lot of trouble with snails,'' Willis said
recently as he surveyed a tiny bed of marigolds and snapdragons.

   A retired Argentine general
arrested in the United States reportedly has been sent back to
Argentina Sunday to face murder charges but a police official here
could not confirm his arrival.
   Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason had acknowledged ordering the 1977
arrest of publisher Jacobo Timerman, The Los Angeles Times reported
Sunday.
   It said he made the statement Saturday before he was extradited
from San Francisco to face 39 murder charges in Argentina.
   Federal Police Chief Juan Angel Pirker, questioned by newsmen in
Buenos Aires about the report, said: ``Officially, I know nothing.''
   A Buenos Aires newspaper, Pagina 12, reported in its Sunday
edition that Suarez Mason had been ``expected to arrive this
morning'' at the capital's Ezeiza International Airport. But it
said strict security measures in San Francisco ``made it impossible
to verify whether Suarez Mason did depart or on what flight,
although it was certain that he left the (San Francisco) country
jail for the airport yesterday (Saturday) at 10:30 am. local time.''
   In a legal deposition, Suarez Mason discussed his role in
Argentina's military government during its ``dirty war'' against
suspected subversives in the 1970s, The Los Angelest Times reported.
   The ex-general was interviewed Friday and Saturday by Joanne
Hoeper, working on behalf of plaintiffs seeking damages in federal
court for victims of the Argentine junta. The junta has been blamed
for the deaths of thousands of people.
   Suarez Mason, 64, said he ordered Timerman's arrest after a
subordinate presented him with accusations that the publisher was
``friends with a man who owned a bank that funded guerrillas,'' the
Times quoted the attorney as saying.
   It was believed to be the first time Suarez Mason had
acknowledged his role in the arrest of Timerman, who described his
imprisonment and torture in the 1981 book ``Prisoner Without A
Name, Cell Without A Number.''
   The newspaper quoted Ms. Hoeper as saying Suarez Mason ``knew
Timerman was being interrogated. He said he listened to a
tape-recording of an interrogation...''
   The military confiscated Timerman's newspaper, La Opinion, which
campaigned against the junta's anti-Semitic policies. Timerman
spent 29 months in jail and under house arrest before being
expelled to Israel, where he became a citizen.
   Timerman returned to Buenos Aires last year and has received $5
million from the government as compensation for the loss of his
newspaper.
   Suarez Mason commanded the First Army Corps in Buenos Aires from
1976 to 1979. He fled the country after a civilian government took
over in 1983 and was arrested in January 1987 south of San
Francisco, where he was living under an assumed name.
   A panel of Argentina's civilian government has said at least
9,000 people disappeared during the nine-year rule by the military,
including 5,000 in the region where Suarez Mason was commander.

<TEXT>
   Some kids call it the ``grocery-store
school'' and some parents call it a godsend. It's a baby-sitting
service at the supermarket that lets parents in peace, and leaves
more room in the cart for groceries.
   ``It's definitely helpful, especially when a mother has only two
hands and two children and (is) trying to grocery shop,'' said
35-year-old Karen Redfearn, who drives 17 miles from Herrin to shop
at the Country Fair store in Carbondale.
   ``It's terrific,'' she said.
   Located at the front of the Country Fair store, the baby-sitting
center has a color TV, a video cassette recorder, a 55-gallon
aquarium, two bulletin boards, five bean bags, five plastic trucks
and cars and stuffed animals.
   But if junior still gets bored, there's a 60-piece set of wooden
building blocks, a xylophone, an Etch-a-Sketch, a toy telephone and
a toy cash register. Safety scissors, glue and paint brushes,
crayons, markers and paper complete the picture.
   The 18-by-16-foot area is a separate room from the store. It has
brown carpeted floors and its walls are decorated with drawings by
the children.
   Big windows allow parents to check in on their youngsters while
they shop.
   ``My biggest problem is trying to get the kids to leave on
time,'' said Sandy Overstreet, 23, coordinator of the Carbondale
center. ``They like to go to grocery-store school _ some of the
kids call it that.''
   The child-care center opened in October and entertained its
6,000th youngster this past week.
   ``I've had a lot of positive comments from mothers, from
customers,'' said store manager Thomas J. Schmutz. ``I've had a lot
of older mothers tell me we should've done this 20 years ago.''
   ``The kids enjoy themselves more so than they enjoy grocery
shopping,'' said 32-year-old Connie Hirsh shortly after picking up
her year-old daughter at the center.
   A minimum $25 purchase at the store entitles parents to up to
two hours of free child care. After two hours, there's a $5-an-hour
charge.
   To ensure safety, the same person who checks a child in must
check him out, and parents must remain on the store premises while
the child is at the center.
   Children from age six months to six years are accepted.
   The idea came from Pete Bradham of Mount Vernon, owner of the
five Country Fairs in the Southern Illinois area. All but one offer
the baby-sitting service.

   The people who moved onto the George Ranch
late in 1985 made friends easily. Nobody in this rural area where a
man's background is his own business questioned their claim to have
bought the ranch with an inheritance.
   But the federal government alleges that the Atoka County ranch
north of Stringtown was a cover for laundering more than $1 million
in proceeds from international drug trafficking by claiming the
money came from cattle sales.
   Federal authorities also allege the isolated 2,889-acre
property, since renamed the Junior Ranch, was bought as a refuge
for Jose Contreras Subias, a Mexican national wanted for
questioning in the torture slaying of a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent, the killings of nine Venezuelan national
guardsmen and the slaying of a Mexican federal police officer.
   Contreras was arrested April 1 in Salt Lake City and is jailed
in Los Angeles.
   Although federal officials now say they had been investigating
the southeast Oklahoma ranch for two years, the lid started coming
off when two Texans stumbled onto a nearby marijuana-growing
operation in August. They accused the owner of that ranch of
abduction and details started emerging at the subsequent trial.
   ``If he doesn't bother you, then why bother him? Just because
they came in with a lot of money?'' said Troy Gammon, Atoka County
clerk.
   When the Mexicans bought the ranch, it was viewed as a logical
investment of their money.
   ``They told us they inherited it. We believed them and we
welcomed them to the community,'' said Atoka City Manager Martha
Yates. ``We are still in shock.''
   Residents knew Contreras as Joe or Jose Guillen. People
interviewed last week said he was a model citizen who made friends
easily because of his gentel ways.
   ``They were planting feed, not dope,'' said a businessman who
would talk to a reporter only if his name were not used. ``They
came here to make it their home.''
   Contreras drove a hard bargain and wrote checks for purchases
rather than paying cash, the businessman said. Most big-ticket
items were financed.
   ``Does that sound like they were laundering money?'' he asked.
   But residents reported to be closely associated with Contreras
now deny knowing him well. People who attended parties at the ranch
threaten lawsuits if their names are mentioned in connection with
Contreras.
   Contreras, 42, originally was arrested in 1985 in Costa Rica
with Mexican drug king Rafael Caro Quintero. Quintero is awaiting
trial in the 1985 slaying of U.S. DEA agent Enrique Camarena.
   Contreras was sent to jail in Tijuana, Mexico, to stand trial
for the slaying of a Mexican federal agent. But he escaped in
October 1985 after bribing his jailers, according to documents
filed by DEA agents.
   Two months before his escape, a group of Mexicans negotiated to
buy the Atoka County ranch from rancher E.H. George, at a price of
$900,000, plus $99,000 for the cattle and hay, according to an FBI
affidavit.
   The $500,000 down payment originated as cashier's checks in
Tijuana on Oct. 22, 1985, six days before Contreras' escape. Ten
days after his escape, a checking account was opened at the Atoka
State Bank for Jose Guillen.
   From November 1985 through September 1987, more than $1.4
million was deposited in the Atoka State Bank account, according to
a federal affidavit. Neither the bank nor its officers has been
accused of wrongdoing. More money went into a bank in Durant.
   Contreras' alleged operation began to come unraveled in August,
when two Texans rode their three-wheelers onto the Bar-20 Ranch.
They said they were shot at, abducted and held in chains before
they escaped.
   Police raided the ranch and discovered more than 6,700 marijuana
plants. Ranch owner Elbert Lucien Johnson and two co-defendants
were convicted of running one of the state's largest marijuana
farms.
   At the trial, testimony brought up small details linking the two
ranches and the people associated with them. Among other things,
authorities allege Johnson provided the introductions for the
Mexicans to buy the George Ranch.
   ``We've been aware that they were there for a long time,'' U.S.
Attorney Roger Hilfiger said of the Junior Ranch. He said Johnson's
arrest ``let the cat out of the bag.''
   The day after Contreras' arrest, federal authorities raided the
Junior Ranch and another property near Plano, Texas, and seized
documents they are still studying. They also filed notice of
intention to seize the ranch and other property as the proceeds of
illegal drug transactions.
   No criminal charges have been filed related to the operation of
the Junior Ranch, but a federal grand jury convenes May 31 in
Muskogee.

<HEAD>Horse Racing Ballot Question Appears To Carry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with final Lubbock returns and additional Dallas
returns, Austin mayoral results; fixes style of pari-mutuel
throughout. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ballot proposal to authorize horse racing and
pari-mutuel betting was approved Saturday in Dallas County and, by
a narrow margin, in Lubbock County, where church leaders opposed it.
   They were the only two Texas counties voting on the issue
Saturday. Other counties voted in November, when residents
statewide approved a proposal to let counties determine whether to
allow wagering on horses.
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote in Dallas
County was 40,793, or 56 percent, for pari-mutuel betting and
31,626, or 44 percent, against.
   The final tally in Lubbock County was 18,939, or 52 percent, for
pari-mutuel betting, and 17,541, or 48 percent, against.
   Throughout the state, voters were also electing mayors, city
councilmen and school trustees.
   The voting stirred limited interest in Dallas County, where
elections administrator Bruce Sherbet said he expected only about
10 percent of the registered voters to turn out.
   But Lubbock City Secretary Ranette Boyd said her telephone was
kept busy with calls from people wanting to know where they could
vote. She predicted a Lubbock County turnout almost twice that of
the last general election.
   Pari-mutuel betting was the most volatile issue on the ballot in
the county since a narrow vote almost 20 years ago to legalize
mixed-drink sales.
   Proponents of horse race betting tout it as a
multimillion-dollar economic boon; opponents say it will lead to
crime and compulsive gambling.
   Citizens Against Pari-Mutuel Gambling campaigned against the
proposition largely through a mailing to 100 local churches, said
Gene Glaeser, minister of Broadway Church of Christ in Lubbock.
   In the Austin mayoral race, incumbent Mayor Frank Cooksey came
in second to former City Councilman Lee Cooke, but six other
candidates split enough votes to force a runoff.

<TEXT>
   A 40-foot adult gray whale was found dead
and lodged under a pier in San Francisco Bay on Saturday, officials
said.
   Mary Jane Schramm, a spokeswoman with the California Marine
Mammal Center in Sausalito, said it wasn't immediately known if the
whale was dead when it washed under Pier 70, or if it died after
getting under the structure.
   The whale had deep slash marks on its head, and some of them
involved the animal's blow hole, which allows it to inhale and
exhale, said Schramm.
   Schramm feared the marks could have been caused by a ship's
propeller. But she did not rule out the possibility they were made
by a veterinarian who examined the dead whale after it was found.
He could not be reached for comment.
   Whales often hug the California coastline while migrating
between Arctic waters and the warmer Baja California waters from
January through May, Schramm said.
   Authorities were relieved to learn that the dead whale was not
the juvenile whale that was spotted several times in recent weeks
frolicking around the bay, she said.

<TEXT>
   The wife of American hostage Terry
Anderson has issued an appeal to President Reagan to help free him
from captors in Lebanon.
   Madeleine Bassil made a televised statement Saturday to Reagan,
saying, ``Mr. President, you probably have never heard of me but
you certainly know that Terry Anderson, hostage in Lebanon for over
three years, has a family.''
   Ms. Bassil, who is Lebanese, said their 2-year-old daughter
Sulome ``cannot accept my excuses any longer of why her daddy is
only a picture.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated
Press, was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985. He has never seen
his daughter.
   Ms. Bassil's plea to Reagan comes four days after three French
hostages were released in Beirut by the Islamic Jihad, the same
pro-Iranian group that claims to hold Anderson.
   ``Compromising now is the only solution,'' she told Reagan.
``Are we to wait (for) an election before we see our loved one? We
can't wait any longer, Mr. President. You must do something now
before things get out of hand.''
   Another American hostage, Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture
at the American University of Beirut, is also believed held by
Islamic Jihad. He was kidnapped in June 1985.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among 18 foreign hostages, including
nine Americans, being held hostage.

   Iraq did not describe the ships further and did not say whether
the attack took place late Saturday or early Sunday.
   There was no immediate word on the attack from Iran.
   The attack took place near the Iranian oil loading platform at
Lavan Island in the southern gulf, the Iraqi agency said.
   ``This attack comes as part of our legal right to tear up all
oil supply routes of the Iranian regime which uses the profits for
its hostile and evil goals,'' the agency said.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war for more than 7{ years.

   Sikh gunmen fired into a group of
migrant workers at a wedding celebration in Haryana state Saturday
night, killing 13 people and wounding at least 25 others, police
said.
   Sikh extremists were blamed for 10 other deaths late Saturday
and early Sunday in the neighboring northern Indian state of
Punjab, including a Hindu family of four and its two servants, the
United News of India reported.
   The extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland for Sikhs in
Punjab. The latest killings raised to more than 940 the number of
deaths blamed on the Sikh separatists since the start of the year.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs in Punjab
who oppose the radicals' guerrilla campaign.
   The migrant workers were killed near Panipat, 90 miles south of
the joint Punjab-Haryana state capital at Chandigarh.
   Police said that six gunmen crossed from Punjab state into
Haryana and fired AK-47 automatic rifles at the workers as they
were celebrating a wedding.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million
population but are a majority in Punjab.

   The Supreme Court on Sunday delayed the
deportation of Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American, and ordered the
government to explain its decision, a court spokesman said.
   Justice Shoshana Netanyahu scheduled a hearing on Awad's appeal
for Monday morning, spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen told The Associated
Press.
   Awad, 44, an advocate of civil disobedience, was detained
Thursday. The expulsion order was issued Friday and was to take
effect at midnight Sunday.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir issued the expulsion order against
Awad, alleging he incited violence during the 5-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
According to U.N. figures, 184 Palestinians and two Israelis have
been killed since the violence began Dec. 8.
   Israel has also accused Awad of being behind a leaflet issued
last month that urged Palestinians to throw firebombs and rocks at
Israeli targets.
   Israel radio said Awad filed an appeal against the deportation
Sunday after his attorneys visited him in a Jerusalem jail, where
he has been on hunger strike since his arrest.
   The Jerusalem-born Awad heads the Center for Non-Violent Studies
in Jerusalem. Some of the methods preached by Awad, such as
boycotts of Israeli goods, nonpayment of taxes and sit-ins, have
been adopted by underground leaders of the uprising.
   Awad has said that unlike Palestine Liberation Organization
extremists, he advocates peaceful coexistence between Israelis and
Palestinians.
   Awad is a U.S. citizen who has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio. The
deportation order prompted protests from the U.S. government, which
urged Israel to reconsider the move.

   Clarence ``Cap'' Cornish celebrated the
70th anniversary of his first solo flight the same way he's marked
the occasion every year _ flying high.
   The 89-year-old retired insurance executive took his wife, Lois,
and daughter, Ruthanne Krieg, for a five-minute plane ride Friday.
Through the years, Cornish hasn't missed a single May 6
commemorative flight.
   Flying was different when the man who eventually became
Indiana's first aeronautics commissioner first took to the air as a
19-year-old.
   ``There weren't any navigational aids at all then and no charts.
I flew with a Rand McNally road map,'' said Cornish. ``Those were
the days before parachutes, too. If you made a serious error, you
could end up dead and embarrassed.''
   Cornish served during World War I in the aviation section of the
Signal Corps, the precursor of the U.S. Air Force. Cornish took his
first solo flight May 6, 1918, after just four hours and 20 minutes
of instruction. He was then assigned to train other young airmen.
   ``I didn't know anything about fighting Germans in the air and
neither did my students,'' he said. ``It was the blind leading the
blind.''
   Cornish served for eight years as Indiana's first aeronautics
commissioner following World War II.

   Everyone was so busy marching and judging
and eating strawberries that hardly anyone noticed the homemade
shortcake had taken a big splat and had to be replaced with the
store-bought variety.
   Beauty queens and high school bands marched through this town of
2,000 and judges tasted every variety of strawberry recipe as North
Carolinians celebrated their 56th Strawberry Festival.
   The weekend fair, billed as the state's oldest agricultural
festival, drew hundreds of entries and thousands of spectators.
   ``I don't think anybody has noticed that the cakes were
store-bought,'' said Jack Yates.
   He was supposed to deliver 15 large sheet cakes baked by the
women of his fraternal society, based in another town a few miles
away. But the cakes fell out of the back of the pickup.
   Yates said he and a fellow lodge member ``heard something'' when
a large truck passed them. ``We got out, went around and looked,
and sure enough ... all the cake was in little pieces all over the
highway.''
   They beat it to a local supermarket and bought up as much pound
cake as they could find _ enough to make the approximately 1,500
servings needed.

   When Theresa Earwood left Virginia
Speciality Stores to pick up lunch for a co-worker, she didn't plan
to bring home a moral dilemma in the bag.
   Inside was a game piece for a new giveaway being test-marketed
by Wendy's in Virginia. Ms. Earwood opened the piece, thinking
Bernadette Barber would never notice.
   It was an instant $5,000 winner.
   Morals came out on top, and Ms. Earwood, 26, decided to slip the
piece back in the bag and forget about it.
   ``I would have had to live with it for the rest of my life,''
she said.
   Ms. Barber, 39, found the open game piece in her lunch Thursday,
but didn't realize she had won until a few hours later. ``Then when
I did, I cried.''
   Mike Fields, district manager for Wendy's International in
Virginia Beach, said the company had to wait for independent
verification that Ms. Barber's game piece was a winner, which
should take about a week.
   After she pays taxes on the prize, Ms. Barber said she plans to
pick up some ``odds and ends.''
   She said she does not plan to split the money with Ms. Earwood,
but will give her some kind of reward.
   ``It's a hard decision,'' she said. ``What would you do?''

   It was with some trepidation that Pat
Bagley, cartoonist for The Salt Lake Tribune, opened the package
from retiring Salt Lake City Police Chief E. L. ``Bud'' Willoughby.
   After all, Bagley had lampooned the chief more than once about
the day in 1980 when Willoughby popped a trash can over his head
and gingerly carried a what looked like a bomb out of a bank. The
``bomb'' turned out to be a bundle of highway flares.
   The moment was captured on film and published in the newspaper,
and there are those who believe to this day that Willoughby
secretly wished he could have crawled underneath that can and
stayed there until the cameras were gone.
   So it wasn't surprising that Bagley took cover beneath his own
trash can and cautiously peeled away the tape on the cardboard box.
   The precautions were unnecessary. So were Bagley's concerns that
maybe Willoughby didn't like him so well.
   The box contained one of Willoughby's prized possessions _ the
official Salt Lake City Bomb Squad ``helmet'' given him by
thoughtful patrolmen after the bank incident.
   It's a gunmetal gray trash can, resplendent with official Salt
Lake City Police patches, visor and a peephole.

<HEAD>Prominent Psychiatrist Accused Of Unethical Conduct In Fortune
Squabble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the American Psychiatric
Association is accused in a probate dispute of exploiting a woman
who gave him $80,000 a year in trusts and willed $5 million to a
psychiatric institute she founded during a decade of psychoanalysis
with him.
   The legal battle is between Dr. George Pollock, one of Chicago's
leading psychoanalysts, and Francis L. Lederer II, only child of
Anne P. Lederer, who died in 1984 at age 78.
   Pollock denies any wrongdoing.
   Mrs. Lederer left most of her estimated $5 million estate to a
non-profit institute she established four years earlier to promote
psychiatric research and music. None of the money has been paid,
however, because her son is contesting her will in Cook County
Probate Court. A trial is scheduled to begin July 5.
   Lederer accused Pollock of improperly using his influence while
treating his mother for depression to urge her to create the
institute and ``wrongfully inducing'' her to bequeath her fortune
to it, according to court documents.
   Pollock, who was attending the annual meeting of the association
in Montreal, referred calls for comment to his attorney, Robert
Tepper of Chicago. Tepper said he had advised Pollock not to
discuss the case.
   But Pollock denied the allegations in an affidavit Dec. 4, 1986.
   ``I never made false representations to her for the purpose and
with the intent of improperly controlling, dominating and
misleading her and unduly influencing and wrongfully inducing her
to execute her last will,'' Pollock said.
   Tepper said he saw ``no support or substantiation'' for claims
that Mrs. Lederer was incompetent or unduly influenced.
   ``But anyone can file a lawsuit, and these days it has become a
recognized means of social expression,'' he added.
   Dr. Larry Strasburger, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist who
reviewed Pollock's conduct in Mrs. Lederer's case at the request of
her son's attorneys, contended in a deposition that there were
grounds for a malpractice suit. He was paid $200 an hour as an
expert witness.
   Strasburger said he reviewed Mrs. Lederer's prescription records
and found she was taking enough medication to become
psychologically and physically addicted.
   Pollock, who will step down as president when the association's
annual meeting ends Thursday, also is director of the Chicago
Institute for Psychoanalysis and a Northwestern University Medical
School professor.
   Pollock conducted up to five sessions a week with Mrs. Lederer
from 1969 to 1980, when he transferred her case to two other
psychiatrists, saying he needed more time for other professional
duties, court documents show.
   Pollock continued prescribing medication for her until 1983, and
records show he told the succeeding psychiatrists in a letter:
   ``Incidentally, I do hope that you are charging her a full fee
for your housecalls and visits. She can well afford it.''
   During the years Mrs. Lederer was a patient of Pollock:
   _She established a trust fund that has paid Pollock $50,000 a
year since 1976 and will continue paying him through 1993. She
established a second trust that has paid Pollock's family $30,000 a
year since 1978. Court records aren't clear when the second trust
expires.
   _From 1969 until her death, Mrs. Lederer donated $601,330 to the
Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Of that money, $60,233 went
to a depression research fund controlled by Pollock.
   _In 1980, she created the Anne P. Lederer Research Institute.
Pollock worked for a short time as a paid consultant to the
institute, but said in his affidavit that ``there is no secret
agreement'' for him to participate in its future operations. He
also denied receiving any benefit from Mrs. Lederer's will.
   _Mrs. Lederer dismissed her longtime attorneys when they
expressed reservations about her institute and hired Chicago lawyer
Leonard Schanfield, a friend of Pollock.
   _In 1982, she amended her will to leave $200,000 to her son,
several thousand dollars to two grandchildren and the rest of her
money _ estimated at $5 million _ to the Lederer Research
Institute. She also named Pollock, Schanfield and Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. as co-executors of her estate.
   Tepper said Mrs. Lederer's son was worth about $2 million before
her death and that when she died he inherited about $6 million from
a trust established by her father, E.J. Pollock, vice president and
comptroller of Sears Roebuck & Co. in the 1930s. The two Pollock
families are not related.
   Mrs. Lederer referred to her son's wealth to explain in her last
will why she was leaving most of her money ``to my foundation.''
   Schanfield said Mrs. Lederer told him that he was one of four
lawyers referred to her by Pollock to review her estate planning
and help her establish the research institute.
   ``Dr. Pollock played no role whatsoever in establishing that
institute,'' Schanfield said Friday in a telephone interview.
``Mrs. Lederer set it up.''
   In their briefs, attorneys for Mrs. Lederer's son, Kevin
Murnighan and Phil Doran, suggest she was dependent on Pollock.
   The attorneys contended that after Mrs. Lederer's husband, a
doctor, died in 1973, ``Dr. Pollock took the place of her husband
and he constantly advised her on all facets of life, from where she
was going to live, to what she was going to eat, to what medical
treatment to get, to what raises to give the housekeeper.''
   Tepper said Mrs. Lederer and Pollock were friends, and that the
psychiatrist accepted her financial gifts ``because there was no
reason not to accept'' them, a point of ethical debate.
   But Strasburger wrote: ``His acceptance of large gifts to his
family, his institution and himself occurred in a pattern of
conduct evidencing gross disregard for psychoanalytic principle and
psychiatric propriety.''
   Dr. Robert Weinstock, a psychiatrist and associate professor at
the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School, said he
knew of no specific guidelines on ethics that prohibit
psychiatrists from accepting gifts or donations from patients.
   ``I can say that it would be unusual while somebody is in
treatment to accept large gifts,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``It's not standard to do that.''
   The American Psychiatric Association's principles of medical
ethics do not contain a specific provision against accepting money
or other gifts from patients beyond professional fees.
   But the principles do say a psychiatrist ``should not use the
unique position of power afforded him by the psychotherapeutic
situation to influence the patient in any way not directly relevant
to the treatment goals.''

<TEXT>
   The Tony Awards nominating committee has a happy
problem this year, more talent and worthy performances in some
categories than can be squeezed into the customary four nominations.
   Contrary to what has happened in some recent seasons, this year
there should be some interesting contests in Broadway's equivalent
of Hollywood's Oscars.
   The nominations are due to be announced Monday. The winners of
the 42nd annual awards, to be chosen by a vote by more than 600
theater professionals, will be announced June 5 in a program
broadcast nationally on CBS.
   Three plays eligible for ``best play'' Tony contention are by
playwrights who have previously won the Pulitzer Prize, David
Mamet, August Wilson and Lanford Wilson.
   The last play to open before the Tony deadline was Mamet's
``Speed the Plow,'' which got lavish media attention because it
stars rock star-actress Madonna. Mamet's ``Glengarry Glen Ross''
won a Pulitzer in 1984.
   ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' set early this century, is
August Wilson's latest in his series of plays about the black
experience in America, each set in a different decade. His
``Fences,'' set in the 1950s, which won him a Pulitzer Prize last
year, is still running.
   Lanford Wilson, who won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for ``Talley's
Folly,'' one of his cycle of plays about the Talley family on
Broadway, has a contender this season that isn't in that series,
``Burn This.''
   Three possible ``best play'' nominees are based on real
happenings. ``M. Butterfly'' is about a French diplomat who had an
affair with a Chinese Communist thinking the man is a woman. ``A
Walk in the Woods'' shows an American and a Russian arms negotiator
talking informally outside their conference room in Geneva. And
``Breaking the Code,'' which opened early in the season and is no
longer running, is about Alan Turing, who broke the German's code
in World War II.
   In musicals, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``The Phantom of the Opera''
is by far the season's hottest ticket and is almost assured a Tony
nomination. It's not necessarily assured the Tony, since the
Broadway community's Tony voters are proud of putting their
artistic opinions ahead of box-office sales.
   Anything Stephen Sondheim composes also is almost assured a Tony
nomination. He won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1985 for
``Sunday in the Park with George.'' His ``Into the Woods,'' fairy
tales with ``realistic'' endings, opened this season.
   There's also ``Chess,'' another American-Russian confrontation,
with music by the two writers for the rock group ABBA and lyrics by
Lloyd Webber's old partner, Tim Rice; ``Sarafina!'', a South
African musical set in a terrorized schoolyard; and ``The Gospel at
Colonus,'' the Oedipus story told in gospel music. Three which
didn't run long are ``Roza,'' ``Mail'' and ``Teddy and Alice.''
   The nominating committee's trouble with the best-actor category
this year should be narrowing nominees down to four. Derek Jacobi
was virtually a one-man show in ``Breaking the Code.'' John
Malkovich, no longer in the cast, was a bravura wild man in ``Burn
This.'' Robert Prosky plays the Russian negotiator, the meatier of
the two parts, in ``A Walk in the Woods.'' John Lithgow is the
French diplomat in ``M. Butterfly.''
   Christopher Plummer has the title role in ``Macbeth.'' Joe
Mantegna and Ron Silver costar in ``Speed the Plow.'' Frank
Langella had the showy title role in ``Sherlock's Last Case,''
which opened last August and ran into December.
   As usual, starring parts for women are fewer. Blythe Danner, who
now has left the cast, was Blanche in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
Joan Allen played opposite Malkovich in ``Burn This.'' Prosky and
Lithgow act opposite men in their plays. Glenda Jackson is Lady
Macbeth. Madonna is the third character in ``Speed the Plow.''
   For performers in musicals, Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman
sing the phantom and his obsession in ``The Phantom of the Opera.''
Patti LuPone and Howard McGillin sing Cole Porter in the revival of
``Anything Goes.'' Joel Grey stars again in the revived ``Cabaret.''
   Len Cariou sang Teddy Roosevelt in the departed ``Teddy and
Alice.'' Bernadette Peters opened but no longer plays in ``Into the
Woods.'' Judy Kuhn forms the triangle on the chessboard of David
Carroll and Philip Casnoff in ``Chess.''
   Longer shots for nominations are Michael Rupert, starring in
``Mail,'' which he composed, and Georgia Brown singing Gilbert
Becaud songs in ``Roza,'' which was based on the movie ``Madame
Rosa,'' starring Simone Signoret.
   The Tonies are named for actress Antoinette Perry, who was
active in the American Theater Wing during the 1940s.

   Taxicab driver Harry Gibbs couldn't believe
his eyes. There was the man who stole his pants, asking for a ride
home.
   ``He walked up, higher than a kite, and wanted me to take him
home,'' Gibbs said Friday. ``He got a ride home, all right.''
   Pierce County sheriff's Sgt. Steve Kemmerer confirmed that a man
was in custody for investigation of armed robbery.
   Gibbs, 39, said he signaled a fellow cabbie to follow, took his
passenger to an apartment near the gate of McChord Air Force Base
south of town and then waited with the other driver until sheriff's
deputies arrived and arrested the man Thursday night.
   The man had hailed his cab in the same convenience store parking
lot where he had accosted Gibbs with a sawed-off shotgun a week
earlier, Gibbs said. In that incident, the robber demanded his
pants after finding only $49 in his wallet.
   The pants and wallet were later found nearby.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boston effort to relieve runway congestion
by increasing landing fees for small planes is evolving into a
national debate over the role of major airports.
   What was a local dispute involving Logan International Airport
has spilled over to Congress, the Department of Transportation and
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``This is just the first foot over the line,'' said Rep.
Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who has introduced legislation designed
to block Logan from implementing the plan. ``There are airports all
over the country sort of foaming at the mouth, just waiting to
follow suit.''
   But Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said that ``deteriorating
air traffic gridlock'' justifies Logan's goal of encouraging small
aircraft to use other airfields in the area, saying, ``It's a
balancing of equities.''
   Logan faces a problem common to many airports: Air traffic and
delays are growing, but expansion is unrealistic because of
neighborhood opposition, a lack of available land and enormous
construction costs.
   So the Massachusetts Port Authority, or Massport, the state
agency that operates Logan, has announced a plan it says will
permit more efficient use of the airport by 23 million passengers
annually.
   As of July 1, landing fees for private planes and commuter
airlines will be increased from the current minimum of $25 to an
average of close to $100. The costs for large airliners _ now
hundreds of dollars _ will drop by varying amounts.
   ``Massport has concluded that the test of efficiency at Logan is
not the number of airplanes landed per hour, but the number of
people handled per hour with a minimum of delay,'' the agency's
executive director, David W. Davis, said when the plan was approved
March 16. ``In other words, a 747 with 400 people on board deserves
a higher priority than a Cessna with two people on board.''
   The commuter airline, corporate aircraft and private plane
industries say the Logan plan is unfair because they have as much
right to use the government-supported airport as airlines do. And
the higher fees will hurt their businesses, they say.
   ``We price our service at what we think the market will stand,''
said John Fredericksen, executive vice president of the Regional
Airline Association, which represents the nation's commuter
carriers. ``If we thought that extra money was out there, we'd
charge it.''
   Officials of the small plane industry fear that Logan's plan may
be only the beginning of restrictions across the country.
   Although air traffic grows every year, the last major U.S.
metropolitan airport _ Dallas-Fort Worth International _ was
completed in 1974. No new airports are under construction, although
two cities _ Denver and Austin _ are moving toward building new
ones, and about a dozen others hope to add runways at existing
airfields.
   Since new airports take at least four years to build _ and cost
$1.5 billion to $2 billion _ existing fields are moving to make
better use of what they have. Modern air traffic equipment will
allow more frequent takeoffs and landings, but it is expensive and
in many cases needs further development.
   As delays grow, more airfields are considering shunting some of
their small plane traffic elsewhere by raising fees, particularly
during busy morning and evening hours.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports, is expected in
September to impose slight rush hour increases in takeoff fees for
small planes.
   Massport spokesman Tom Champion declined to name airports that
have contacted his agency but conceded, ``There are a lot of people
watching us with great interest.''
   Said Fredericksen of the regional airline group, ``Our concern
is that airports will try to limit traffic, rather than expand
capacity.''
   Boehlert's bill, and an identical Senate version co-sponsored by
seven Northeastern lawmakers, face uncertain futures. The 1988
congressional schedule is a short one, and committee chairmen say
they have not decided whether to even hold hearings for the
legislation.
   But Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a private plane pilot, said he will
try attaching an amendment to a spending bill this month that would
kill the Logan plan and discourage other airports from adopting
similar restrictions.
   ``This is a national airspace system, and here we have one
airport trying to make policy,'' he said.
   Opponents of the Logan program have opened other fronts. Small
plane industry groups have filed federal lawsuits in Boston and
also have asked the FAA and Transportation Department to step in on
their behalf.
   Supporters of Logan's efforts say, however, that similar plans
are inevitable.
   ``It's the wave of the future,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``As the skies get more crowded, rational pricing policies
will be imposed at other airports, and Logan is blazing the trail.''

<HEAD>Questions Remain On Missile Pact As Senate Nears Debate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is expected to open debate on the
new U.S.-Soviet missile treaty this week, provided the White House
and the Kremlin can resolve last-minute questions over verification
provisions and the use of futuristic technology.
   ``We're still conferring with the Senate and hope to come to a
resolution by Tuesday evening,'' an administration official said.
``We have discussed this with the Soviets and ... we feel confident
it can be resolved,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified.
   While only a handful of senators are on record as opposed to the
treaty, it is an open question whether there is time to ratify it
before President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev open
their Moscow summit meeting on May 29.
   Senate Majority leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia,
resisting appeals from Reagan, has said he will not be driven by
the approaching summit or by any other outside factor.
   Last month, Byrd set Wednesday as a tentative date for the
opening of debate on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF
treaty if the outstanding issues can be resolved.
   On Monday and Tuesday the Senate will consider legislation
authorizing $299.5 billion in spending for the Pentagon. The bill
also calls for increased spending on non-nuclear weapons in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help reduce Soviet
superiority in such arms.
   Three Senate committees _ Intelligence, Armed Services and
Foreign Relations _ will spend Monday and Tuesday looking for ways
to resolve the four outstanding issues:
   _Futuristic weapons: Byrd wants a legally binding, written
commitment from the Kremlin setting out the extent to which the new
treaty covers medium-range weapons using laser rays, particle beam
generators or other technology still on the drawing boards.
   _Futuristic weapons verification: Byrd wants a Senate
Intelligence Committee report on the ability of U.S. intelligence
agencies to verify a ban on futuristic weapons.
   _Verification: Byrd wants the Soviets to make clear they will
live up to treaty terms that require intrusive on-site inspection
to detect cheating. Some Soviet officials have been quoted as
saying certain practices would not be allowed on Soviet soil. Byrd
told reporters recently he wants to make sure the Soviets are not
backing away from treaty requirements.
   _Intelligence: Byrd wants a Reagan administration commitment
that it will significantly increase long-range spending for U.S.
intelligence efforts to monitor Soviet compliance with treaties,
including obtaining more effective spy satellites.
   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the INF treaty in a White House
ceremony last Dec. 8.
   Since then, the pact has been subjected to intense scrutiny by
the Foreign Relations Committee, which has primary jurisdiction
over treaties, as well as by the Armed Services and Intelligence
panels, each focusing on their areas of expertise.
   If it goes into effect, the pact would require the elimination
of U.S. and Soviet ground-launched missiles with ranges between 300
and 3,400 miles.
   A leading sticking point in the controversy over whether or not
futuristic weapons are included in the medium-range weapon ban is
the fact the treaty contains no definition of exactly what
constitutes a ``weapon delivery vehicle.''
   U.S. negotiators testified that they and their Soviet
counterparts made no attempt to define terms that had a generally
understood meaning and that the word ``weapon'' fell into that list.
   Maynard Glitman, the chief U.S. negotiator, testified that while
the subject of futuristic weapons was never specifically raised in
the negotiations, the term ``weapon delivery vehicle'' covers any
medium-range missile _ however armed _ if it is able to destroy a
target.
   An initial Soviet attempt last month to resolve the issue went
awry in confusion over differences in two translations of a letter
from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   During the defense bill debate, amendments are likely to both
increase spending for NATO and also call for U.S. allies in the
16-nation alliance to pay more of NATO's costs.
   Also expected are proposals providing advice to Reagan from both
conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the arms
control policies he should follow in the last six months of his
administration.
   The House is expected to give final approval Wednesday to its
Pentagon bill. Similar action by the Senate will send the separate
measures to a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile the
differences.

   Thousands of Chinese schoolchildren will go
without textbooks this fall because of a worsening paper shortage,
an official newspaper reported Sunday.
   The English-language China Daily said the crunch resulted from
the rising cost of making paper, hoarding by speculators who resell
it for profit, and a state-ordered cut in imports.
   It also said many manufacturers are reluctant to make the kind
of paper used in newspapers, magazines and textbooks because the
government keeps the factory sale price unprofitably low.
   The State Council, China's cabinet, has ordered local
governments that publish and distribute textbooks to increase
subsidies to encourage publication. It also gave publishers
permission to raise prices, the report said.
   China uses about 13 million tons of paper each year, the
newspaper said.

   The Soviet Union conducted an underground nuclear
test Sunday on an Arctic island to upgrade its military technology,
Tass said.
   The blast at Novaya Zemlya island north of the Arctic Circle
measured from 20 to 150 kilotons, the official news agency said.
Twenty kilotons, the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT, was the
force of the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.
   The last Soviet nuclear test was on May 4 at the Semipalatinsk
range in Soviet Kazakhstan.
   Soviet officials have proposed a ban on nuclear tests, but the
United States disagrees with the Soviets on how to enforce it.

   The Red Cross will undertake an operation
to help civilians in war zones where four relief groups were banned
earlier this year, one of its directors said.
   Andre Pasquier, operations director of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said his group was trying to arrange
safe conduct for the project with Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi and
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The Red Cross expected to begin shipping in food and medical
supplies from neighboring Kenya and Uganda and distributing them in
southern Sudan by the end of May. He said the prime minister had
pledged to help the operation.
   In the past, there have been tensions between relief
organizations and the government, which bans contacts with rebels.
   They took up arms against the government of this East Africa
nation in 1983, demanding more autonomy and economic reforms. Since
then, fierce fighting has forced hundreds of thousands of
southerners to flee to towns and cities, where they depend on
relief food.
   Government officials who banned the four relief groups said they
were no longer needed. But other sources said the government acted
mainly because the groups had contacted rebels to arrange for
transport of food supplies to civilians caught in the cross fire.
   The rebels, who control more than 90 percent of the southern
countryside, have been attacking relief convoys. They claim the
government uses them to transport military troops and supplies.

   Authorities resumed force-feeding a jailed

   Shih Ming-teh, 47, was convicted of instigating a 1979
anti-government riot in Kaohsiung. He went on a hunger strike in
March 1986, saying the government had failed to release other
political prisoners involved in the riot.
   He was forcibly fed a high-protein liquid since he began his
hunger stirke. But the feeding stopped April 22 after he threatened
suicide.
   The Taiwan Association for Human Rights said that since
Saturday, Shih had been fed again with glucose through a nasal tube
at a military-run hospital.
   The group quoted hospital doctor Fu Yih-chu as saying Shih's
health had deteriorated with unstable breathing, low blood sugar,
high blood pressure and a malfuctioning liver.

<TEXT>
   A Turk who was acquitted of conspiracy
in the shooting of Pope John Paul II has been detained in France,
it was reported Sunday.
   The Istanbul daily Hurriyet quoted Sabahattin Cakmakoglu,
general director of the Security Department of the Interior
Ministry, as saying French authorities notified them Friday of the
detention of Oral Celik.
   Cakmakoglu told Hurriyet he did not have any other details.
   Other Turkish dailies quoted unidentified Interior Minister
officials as saying they too were notified Friday night about
Celik's detention.
   Celik is wanted in Turkey on charges of complicity in the 1979
murder of Abdi Ipekci, a liberal newspaper editor in Istanbul, and
of murder in the killing of a teacher, Nevzat Yildirim, three
months later in Malatya.
   Cakmakoglu said Turkey had reiterated to France its request for
Celik's extradition.
   In March 1986, a court in Rome found Celik, three Bulgarians and
two Turks innocent of charges of conspiring to kill the pope on May
13, 1981 in St. Peter's Square.
   Another Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, was convicted of trying to kill
John Paul and was sentenced to life in prison. Celik had been
described as Agca's right arm and best friend.
   The prosecutor had asked for a life sentence for Celik, who was
at large and tried in absentia on charges of firing at the pope
with Agca. Celik was acquitted for lack of evidence.
   Under Italian law, acquittal for lack of evidence does not
amount to a complete finding of innocence. It means that the court
believes there is a possibility of guilt but that it did not hear
enough evidence to support a conviction.
   Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on
the reports of his detention. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said
it had no comment on the reports.

   City officials have installed
about 450 concrete trash cans downtown in a bid to limit damage and
injuries from frequent bomb attacks.
   ``The bins have been designed to cause the least possible damage
in the event of an explosion,'' a city official told The Sunday
Times newspaper.
   ``They are as near bomb-proof as it's humanly possible to make
them,'' he said of the thick concrete bins.
   Two years ago, the city removed 1,300 metal trash cans and 2,500
pole-mounted bins and replaced them with mesh baskets in hopes that
making the contents of bins more visible would deter bombers.
   New bins have been placed in the middle of city blocks instead
of on corners to make it more difficult for someone to
surreptitiously plant bombs.
   There have been more than 70 bombings in South Africa since the
government imposed a nationwide emergency in 1986, and many have
been in the Johannesburg area.
   Police have blamed virtually all of the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress, the main black group fighting to
overthrow the government.

said it got news of the victory in a radio report late Saturday.
   At the same time, Afghanistan's Radio Kabul was reporting it had
inflicted ``heavy losses'' on guerrillas at the same place,
capturing scores of rockets, mortars, machine guns, mines and
ammunition.
   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, did say when that fighting
took place.
   Both reports placed the battle at Chamkani, nine miles west of
the Pakistan border in Paktia province.
   The guerrillas said they attacked retreating Afghan forces and
destroyed 12 tanks and 18 armored personnel carriers.
   ``The fleeing enemy forces could not take away their dead
bodies,'' the statement said. ``On the mujahedeen side, 30 were
martyred and 80 others were injured.''
   It said that on Sunday, Soviet and Afghan forces were still
bombing and shelling the areas of Chamkani and Jaji. It said
guerrillas were sniping at the retreating forces on the highway
leading west to Logar province.
   If the guerrilla report was accurate, it would add to the list
of at least six Soviet-Afghan positions overrun in two weeks.
   Soviet forces reportedly have been pulling back from bases in
eastern Afghanistan in preparation for their total withdrawal,
scheduled to begin May 15. Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan
in December 1979 to back the Afghan government in its war with the
guerrillas.
   Afghan security forces, well-equipped but reportedly sagging in
morale, have had little success in facing the U.S.-armed guerrillas
alone.
   The insurgents, based in Peshawar, Pakistan, claim hundreds of
Afghan army fighters have deserted to the guerrillas since Moscow
announced its intention early this year to end its military
involvement in Afghanistan.
   Two weeks ago, the guerrillas announced a major offensive aimed
at pushing toward Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   On April 22, the guerrillas captured a major Soviet-Afghan
garrison at Barikot, just a few steps from the Pakistan frontier.
It opened a key new supply route for insurgents operating east,
north and west of Kabul.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Some Men Resent Her Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says some of her
male colleagues resent a woman running the country.
   ``Yes, it is rather patronizing. The best compliment they can
give a woman is that she thinks like a man. I say she does not, she
thinks like a woman,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in an interview with The
Sunday Times.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 62, last week marked nine years in power, the
longest of any prime minister this century.
   She is one of only 41 women in the 630-member House of Commons.
She agreed with interviewer Brtian Walden that some of the men
there are puzzled because she doesn't fit their image of women as
dithery and weak.
   ``The House is still very much male-dominated and there is
something about them, a sort of `little woman' thing. It would be
all right if I had gone into what they would regard as one of the
traditional professions _ all right if I had followed Florence
Nightingale; all right, you know, if I had gone into teaching,''
she said.
   Florence Nightingale is regarded as the founder of modern
nursing for her life-saving work among soldiers during Britain's
Crimean war with Russia in 1854.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party has won all three general
elections it contested under her leadership and she said she hopes
to lead it into the next election in 1991, and maybe the one after
that.
   She said she won't step down until she believes her party has
enough younger people committed to her policies.
   Mrs. Thatcher rejected suggestions she is authoritarian and
ruthless in her effort to ``turn Britain round'' and restore the
``British sense of enterprise and initiative.''
   ``The view I take is that a prime minister has a task of
leadership. If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall
prepare himself to the battle? All right, so I give a certain
sound,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher greatly admired her father, a grocer and alderman
in a small town, but she said there were people who disliked her
success because they despised her origins.
   ``Some of them are snobs,'' she said. ``They can never forgive
me for coming from a very ordinary background. It does not bother
me at all. I cannot stand snobbery of any kind.''

<HEAD>Murder, Rape, Robbery Rates Higher in U.S. Than Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The murder, rape and robbery rate in the
United States was several times higher than in Europe in the early
1980s at a time when overall U.S. crimes rates were declining, a
newly issued government study said Sunday.
   In 1984, the United States had 7.9 homicides, 35.7 rapes and
205.4 robberies per 100,000 people, concluded the study by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   The European nations the same year had an average of 1.5
homicides, 5.4 rapes and 49.1 robberies per 100,000 people. 1984 is
the latest year for which comparative figures were available.
   Rates for other crimes also were higher in the United States.
However, the difference in property crime rates was not as great.
   In 1984, the U.S. burglary rate was 20 percent higher than in
Europe. U.S. rates for auto theft and larceny were about double the
average in Europe.
   From 1980 to 1984, the rate for crimes reported to police in the
United States fell for each offense studied, except for rape. The
declines ranged from 12 percent for auto theft to 24 percent for
burglary.
   Meanwhile, the average crime rates for Europe and for Canada,
Australia and New Zealand collectively increased for all crimes
except murder in the early 1980s.
   The U.S. rates for violent crime in 1984 also were higher than
those in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but the differences
were smaller than those with Europe. And data from the
International Police Organization shows a burglary rate for Canada,
Australia and New Zealand that is about 40 percent higher than the
U.S. rate.
   The study examined homicide, rape, robbery, larceny, burglary
and auto theft because those are the crimes most likely to be
understood and defined in the same general way from country to
country.

<HEAD>Danes Asked To Choose: No-Nuke Policy or NATO Allies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Danes on Tuesday will be faced with
the tricky choice between their NATO allies and their longstanding
opposition to nuclear weapons in one of the country's most
important elections since World War II.
   The sudden storm over Denmark's role in the 16-nation alliance
came as a surprise to many voters, usually more worried about
unemployment and national debt than military issues. A ban on
nuclear weapons in peacetime has already been in effect for three
decades.
   The showdown began April 14 when the opposition, led by the
Social Democrats, pushed through a parliamentary resolution
requiring the government to notify visiting warships of the nuclear
arms ban.
   The United States and Britain never confirm or deny the presence
of nuclear weapons on their ships.
   The allies reacted sharply, saying the move jeopardized
Denmark's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
A meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group was rescheduled from
Denmark to Belgium. Britain called off several Royal Navy port
visits.
   Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, a NATO supporter, called a
general election, asking voters to ``take a stand'' on the issue.
   ``Has the Danes' national pride deteriorated so much that we
will bow to pressure from abroad?'' the left-leaning newspaper
Information asked in a front-page editorial.
   ``The question is the central one in the current debate, and in
that sense, the election is the most important since the Second
World War.''
   It didn't help matters when Reagan administration spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater joked to reporters that ``Danish means breakfast
to me.''
   National radio played the English-language tape on the air, an
unusual step, and the liberal Politiken newspaper printed the
sarcastic headline, ``Reagan staff demonstrates its knowledge of
Denmark.'' Fitzwater later apologized.
   The confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this
country of 5.1 million. The last general election in September left
Schlueter's four-party coalition holding just 70 of the Folketing's
179 votes, but with enough support to command a majority on
economic matters.
   Tuesday's vote is not a direct referendum on NATO, but a vote
for representatives in the Folketing. What happens afterward
depends on how many votes are split among the Social Democrats, the
biggest single party, Schlueter's center-right coalition and a
handful of smaller parties.
   Polls indicate that while most Danes agree with the traditional
anti-nuclear position, many have contradictory feelings about NATO.
   One survey said 82 percent of those asked favored a nuclear-free
zone in Scandinavia, and 46 percent said they would support the
idea even if it meant Denmark's expulsion from NATO.
   But a recent poll by the Observa organization showed that 66
percent of Danes favor staying in NATO and just 16 percent oppose
membership, the most lopsided margin in years.
   Another published survey showed that 46 percent of Danes
believed it was reasonable to ask NATO ships to guarantee they
carry no nuclear arms, 36 percent did not and 18 percent were
undecided.
   Denmark's low-lying peninsula and islands command the approaches
to the Baltic Sea, and NATO strategists envision it as a key supply
point in case of a Soviet invasion.
   The NATO-Danish clash follows years of contention over Denmark's
declining defense spending, which now amounts to 2.1 percent of its
gross national product, among the lowest in the alliance.
   But in random interviews with window shoppers along Stroeget, a
pedestrian street in the heart of Copenhagen, voters seemed more
worried about domestic matters than global politics.
   ``It's not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the
way the government runs society,'' said Susane Nielsen, a
conservative voter who works in a health insurance office. ``We
have to face these economic problems.''
   Unemployment is running at 9.7 percent. With a national debt
worth more than $43 billion, the National Bank has warned that
Denmark's currency could run into trouble unless costs are kept
under control.
   Joergen Thy, editor and writer for a computer magazine, said he
planned to vote against the government because ``I don't think they
have achieved much.''
   The nuclear question?
   ``That's a joke. That's not the issue. Something went wrong in
the corridors,'' he said.
   The no-nuclear notification letter _ the cause of the fuss _ has
yet to be written. It's likely the note would simply restate
national policy without requiring a response from the ships'
commanders.
   Defense setbacks are nothing new for the Danish government. The
April 14 resolution was its 23rd loss in parliament since 1982 on a
defense question. It passed by 75 to 58, with 46 lawmakers absent.
   But the timing of the resolution, as the United States and
Soviet Union discuss further cutbacks in nuclear weapons, probably
touched a nerve on the American side, speculated Nikolaj Petersen,
a professor of political science at Aarhus University.
   ``When the U.S.A. reacts vigorously, it could therefore be
linked to the fact that Denmark has contested an important American
negotiating position,'' he wrote in Det Fri Aktuelt newspaper.

   A resolution sponsored by the Social Democrats obliging Denmark
to notify visiting warships that nuclear arms are barred from
Danish ports in peacetime. The April 14 resolution, which passed
75-58, was sharply criticized by NATO as a challenge to its common
nuclear strategy, and Schlueter called the election rather than
carry out the motion.
   Schlueter portrayed the vote as a choice between preserving or
risking Denmark's full membership in NATO. Auken said the
government is exaggerating the defense issue, and wants to broaden
the campaign to economic issues such as unemployment and welfare

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of federal regulators working on ways
to prevent another stock market crash appears certain to clash with
activist members of Congress who want to do more than the
anti-regulation Reagan administration.
   The group, appointed in mid-March, is chaired by Treasury Under
Secretary George D. Gould and includes the heads of the Federal
Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   According to two sources familiar with its deliberations, the
focus of group's recommendations is likely to be improved
communication and cooperation among both exchanges and regulatory
agencies rather than jurisdictional changes requiring new
legislation.
   If that is the case, it will not satisfy either Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, or Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the finance subcommittee of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   However, one of the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, cautioned that the Gould group's positions were still
fluid and could change before it reports to President Reagan the
week of May 16.
   And, pressure on the group to recommend more than it apparently
had intended increased on two fronts last week.
   An earlier White House panel, headed by Wall Street investment
banker Nicholas F. Brady, issued a statement warning that
regulatory turf fights should not be permitted to sidetrack market
reform, which it said ``will inevitably require legislation.''
   And, according to one of the sources, SEC Chairman David S.
Ruder has made it clear he will stake out an independent position
if the Gould group's final report does not go far enough.
   Ruder has urged that his own agency, which regulates the stock
markets, be given additional authority over stock index futures,
which currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission.
   At the very least, he wants ``tie-breaking'' authority to
resolve disputes during emergencies, such as the record Oct. 19
decline of 508 points in the Dow Jones average.
   Both CFTC Chairwoman Wendy L. Gramm and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan are opposing jurisdictional changes.
   Proxmire has introduced a bill that would create a three-member
committee to coordinate regulation. It would consist of the
chairmen of the SEC, CFTC and the Federal Reserve. The Fed chairman
would head the committee, but disputes would be resolved by
majority vote.
   Markey's staff is still working on legislation and is unlikely
to be finished before the Gould group reports to the president,
according to an aide, who asked not to be identified by name.
   However, Markey has said the SEC, not the CFTC, should regulate
stock index futures.
   The administration working group appears likely to recommend
only one of the changes sought by legislators and the Brady panel:
brief, coordinated ``circuit breakers'' to break the momentum of a
soaring or plunging market, one of the sources said.
   Agreement on margin levels _ the amount of money required to
make an investment in either the stock or futures markets _ was
``still within the realm of possibility'' but less likely because
of strong disagreement between Ruder and Gramm, the source said.
   Futures margins are higher than they were before the Oct. 19
stock market crash, but Ruder has said further increases are
needed. Gramm, reflecting the views of the industry her agency
regulates, has resisted.
   The Federal Reserve sets stock and stock option margins, while
the individual futures exchanges set their own margins. According
to the source, Treasury Department officials also believe ideally
that stock and option exchanges ought to set their own margins.
   However, the Brady panel in its statement last week said
margin-setting was too important to leave to the exchanges. It said
the Fed is the logical agency to set all equity margins to ensure
their harmony with one another.
   According to Markey's aide, the Massachusetts congressman sides
with the Brady panel on that issue and is considering including in
any legislation a direction that stocks and futures margins be not
just harmonious, but equivalent.
   That would be controversial. Gramm and executives of the Chicago
futures exchanges argue that stock and futures margins serve
different purposes and need not be the same.
   Other tentative provisions of Markey's bill would give the SEC
power to impose trading halts and take other action during market
emergencies.
   The legislation also is likely to prohibit cross-market
front-running. Some brokerage firms have been accused of profiting
in either the stock or futures market by trading for their own
accounts in front of a major trade by a big client like a mutual or
pension fund in the other market.
   The Gould group from the start faced criticism from Proxmire and
Markey that it was little more than a delaying tactic by the
administration, anxious to avoid any additional regulation of the
markets.
   They believe Congress must get moving this spring before its
members become preoccupied with the summer political conventions
and their own re-election campaigns in the fall.
   However, the participation of Brady on the side of Proxmire and
Markey has made the debate more complicated than a dispute between
Democrats and Republicans.
   Brady, a former Republican senator from New Jersey, is a close
adviser to Vice President George Bush and is considered a leading
candidate for Treasury secretary should Bush win the presidential
election in November.
   Republican staffers are assisting Democratic aides in drafting
House legislation, although it is unclear what parts Republicans
will ultimately support, according to the Markey aide.
   In the Senate, Brady's backing helped Proxmire obtain more
Republican co-sponsors than Democratic. Five Republicans and three
Democrats have signed on.

<HEAD>Singapore Defends Ouster Of U.S. Diplomat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday defended its ouster of a
U.S. diplomat and offered to back up charges that he meddled in
local politics.
   Washington agreed with ``deep regret'' to a request from
Singapore Saturday to withdraw E. Mason (Hank) Hendrickson, a
political attache.
   The government also asked that Hendrickson be reprimanded along
with two unidentified senior State Department officials who it said
sanctioned his activities.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gong denied allegations, made by
the Home Affairs Ministry, that Hendrickson interfered in
Singapore's politics.
   In meeting members of the political opposition, ``which appears
to be the basis of the Singapore government's protest, Mr.
Hendrickson was doing what American diplomats are expected to do in
any country, namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum of
individuals in order to report accurately developments in the
country in question,'' Gong said.
   In a statement Sunday, Singapore said it would not
``capriciously or arbitrarily expel diplomats from Singapore,
especially when the diplomat in question represents a friendly
nation.''
   ``The assertion that Hendrickson has not in any way acted
improperly can only be a diplomatic fig leaf which the government
is content to allow the United States to wear,'' the statement said.
   Singapore contends that Hendrickson met with opposition
activists and urged them to contest upcoming elections.
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's People's Action Party is heavily
favored to retain control of this island republic of 2.6 million
people in elections that must be held by December 1989.
   The party holds all but one of the 79 seats in parliament and
there is no viable opposition capable of dislodging it.
   Hendrickson ``was trying to manipulate and instigate
Singaporeans, in order to bring about a particular political
outcome,'' the government said.
   His explusion was an unprecedented jolt to normally warm
relations between the two countries. Lee long ago established close
personal and political ties with Washington, and recently returned
from ``private'' talks with President Reagan and Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   The United States is the largest buyer of Singapore's exports
and one of the biggest investors in this former British colony that
gained full independence in 1965.
   The diplomatic tiff is the latest in a chain of events that
began with the arrests last year of 22 Singaporeans accused of
belonging to a ``clandestine communist network.'' They were seized
under the Internal Security Act which allows for indefinate
detention without trial.
   All but one were freed by Dec. 26, most of them with
restrictions on their movements.
   Among them was a lawyer, Patrick Seong, who allegedly was urged
by Hendrickson to fight the government.
   Seong was arrested again on April 19 along with eight of the 22
former detainees. That was less than 24 hours after the eight
proclaimed their innocence and said they had been abused and
coerced into making incriminating statements late last year.
   On April 28, the Home Affairs Ministry said the eight had sworn
fresh declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming
their original guilt. They are still behind bars and officials said
an investigation continues.
   Besides Seong, 34, Hendrickson was linked by the government to
lawyer Patrick Seow, 59. Seow was arrested Friday, hours after he
appeared in court seeking the release of two of those arrested
April 19.
   Seow, a former solictor-general and one time president of the
Law Society, is being held without charge under the Internal
Security Act ``for purposes of investigation into foreign
interferences in Singapore's internal affairs.''
   Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong said two distinct
phases of the so-called political movement had become clear. One
was a Marxist conspiracy involving the original 22, the other was
separate action by foreign elements who made use of the detainees
to meddle in domestic politics, he said.

   Authorities are extending mandatory birth control
to the far northwest's ethnic minorities, but they will be allowed
more children than majority Hans, an official report said Sunday.
   As of July 1, minority couples in cities of Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in
rural areas will be permitted three, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   Minority ethnic groups in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more
than 61 percent of the population, the report said.
   Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of
China's 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country
struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population.
   However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China's 56
ethnic minority groups. The different standard toward minorities
has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the
Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being
overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of supporters of former
President Ferdinand E. Marcos marched through the capital Sunday
and demanded that the ousted leader be allowed to return from exile
to attend his mother's funeral.
   President Corazon Aquino, in a radio broadcast hours after the
march, reiterated that Marcos could not return because his presence
might cause trouble and destabilize the government.
   ``I know that some people were upset that he was not allowed to
return,'' Mrs. Aquino said in her weekly radio program, ``Ask the
President.''
   ``But I think the great majority are concerned that, first of
all, we preserve whatever gains we have attained during the past
two years,'' she said. ``And it is very necessary to preserve the
stability that we have attained for the good of the entire
country.''
   Mrs. Aquino indicated she might allow a visit by any of Marcos'
three children, but she said the family must make a formal request
to give the government time to prepare for security.
   The president said no requests had been made.
   Officials have said the ban on Marcos, who lives in Hawaii,
applied to all members of his immediate family. Immigration
officials said they would be arrested if they entered the
Philippines.
   There have been news reports that Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr.,
planned to sneak into the country to represent his father at the
funeral, which hasn't been scheduled. The former president's other
relatives denied the reports.
   About 4,000 marchers blew whistles, shot off firecrackers and
chanted, ``Marcos! Marcos!'' along a six-mile route from a downtown
park to a suburban Roman Catholic church where the body of Josefa
Edralin-Marcos lay in state.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos died in a hospital Wednesday at the age of
95. Just before she died, Marcos' mother sent Mrs. Aquino a
deathbed wish that her son be allowed to return so she could see
him one last time.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii with his wife and three children during
the February 1986 ``People Power Revolution'' that ended his
20-year rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to the presidency.
   He said in a statement Wednesday that he will ``exhaust all
possibilities'' to attend the funeral. Marcos' younger brother,
Pacifico, and sister, Fortuna Marcos-Barba, said they have not set
a burial date because they hope Mrs. Aquino will change her mind.
   At the head of the march was an empty, makeshift coffin draped
with a Philippine flag and a sign saying, ``Ninoy has died, Cory
has risen, Marcos will come again.''
   Ninoy was the nickname of Mrs. Aquino's husband, former Sen.
Benigno Aquino Jr., who was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983 as he
stepped off a plane after returning to the Philippines from three
years' voluntary exile in the United States. The assassination
triggered waves of protest that contributed to Marcos' downfall.

   An unusual late-night tornado slammed into a
mobile home without warning, killing a woman and her baby and
critically injuring her husband while thunderstorms caused
scattered damage in eastern Nebraska.
   Two-inch hailstones broke windows in Omaha and wind up to 60 mph
pushed over trees and damaged other mobile homes.
   The tornado touched down with no warning, ripping the roof off a
farmhouse and causing extensive damage to another house as well as
the mobile home shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday, said Sarpy County
Chief Deputy Lee Polikov.
   ``The weather service is not feeling too good about not being
able to get a warning out before,'' Polikov said Sunday. ``It is
unusual to have them that late at night in this area. They usually
are in the evening. It couldn't be seen by radar.''
   Steve Byrd, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in
Omaha, said Sunday that the tornado touched down only for a few
minutes. He confirmed the funnel was not detected by radar.
   ``It was the same thunderstorm that we followed with 1-inch hail
in the Lincoln area, but as far as showing a tornado, that wasn't
apparent through our radar detector,'' he said. ``We started
detecting it in western Douglas County, but that was after it had
touched down. It apparently touched down and then went right back
up.''
   Small tornadoes that touch down only briefly are much more
difficult to detect than large ones, Byrd said.
   Two-year-old Lynn True was dead at the scene, Polikov said. Her
mother, Joan True, 29, died of head injuries early Sunday at
University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said hospital
spokesman Tom O'Connor.
   Dennis True, 31, underwent surgery and was reported in critical
but stable condition at Midlands Hospital in Papillion.
   In Omaha, more than 10 miles to the northeast, minor injuries
were reported, trees were knocked down and dozens of small power
outages were reported, along with hail as large as 2 inches in
diameter.
   Byrd said the hail broke windows at his office in north Omaha.
   ``We've got hailstones out here that are as big as hen's eggs.
They are bigger than golf balls,'' he said.
   Six to eight mobile homes in Omaha were damaged, including one
that flipped on its side, said Larry Hamilton Sr., assistant chief
of the Millard Volunteer Fire Department.
   Wahoo, Fremont, Blair and Columbus were hit by wind as strong as
60 mph, the weather service said.

   Bess Myerson was charged in 1970 with
shoplifting from a London department store, according to a
published report.
   Myerson was charged by New Scotland Yard with ``theft from a
shop,'' the Daily News said in its Sunday editions. It said it
based its report on unidentified sources and records.
   The newspaper said that Myerson, who was then the city's
consumer affairs commissioner, left London without taking care of
the charge. It said she paid a fine of about $100 or less in 1987
to end the case.
   The Daily News said it could not be determined what was stolen.
   The newspaper quoted sources as saying she failed to disclose
the London arrest on a Department of Investigation background
questionnaire before her appointment as cultural affairs
commissioner in 1983.
   Speaking generally, John Moscow, an assistant Manhattan district
attorney, said it is a crime to lie or ``seek to deceive'' on DOI
disclosure forms.
   The newspaper said Myerson could not be reached for comment. Her
attorney, Frederick Hafetz, said he had no comment.
   Myerson, a former Miss America, has been charged with conspiring
with her millionaire boyfriend, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, and with
former Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel to rig
Capasso's divorce settlement.
   Myerson, Gabel and Capasso, who is jailed on federal tax evasion
charges, are scheduled for trial Sept. 14.

   Tom Selleck had eyes only for the action
on the court, but most of the crowd watched him at the NCAA Men's
Volleyball Championship.
   The star of TV's ``Magnum, P.I.,'' which aired its final episode
last week, was in Fort Wayne on Friday night to watch semifinal
tournament action between Southern California and Ball State
University in Muncie, Ind.
   The No. 1-ranked Trojans handily defeated the No. 9 Ball State
Cardinals.
   Selleck, who played basketball for USC in the late 1960s and is
a longtime volleyball enthusiast, was there to cheer on his stepson
Kevin Shepard, a USC freshman who was forced to sit out the
tournament because of an injury.
   The 42-year-old actor's presence wasn't announced to the crowd,
but he signed autographs and posed for pictures for fans who
recognized him without his mustache.
   Jill Hofer of Liberty got a kiss from Selleck after she
presented him with a cup of peanuts.
   ``He kissed me. He's so great,'' Ms. Hofer said. ``He's such a
hunk and he smelled awesome.''
   Steve Martz, the father of a USC player, said Selleck likes to
be treated like another father when he comes to games.
   ``He's just like any other parent who wants to see his son
play,'' said Martz of Hacienda Hills, Calif. ``I feel kind of sorry
for him, because he can't go anywhere wihout a million people
bothering him.''

   Watching the Iran-Contra hearings firsthand
gave director Robert Altman ideas he used in developing the CBS
television movie, ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.''
   ``Everybody was convinced they were right, was sure they were,''
Altman said. ``Except they were wrong. There were no
arch-criminals, just people who were convinced they were right.''
   The movie, which was being broadcast Sunday night, was based on
the novel by Herman Wouk about the trial of a U.S. Navy captain,
with Brad Davis in the role of Capt. Queeg. An earlier movie verion
starred Humphrey Bogart.
   What he wanted, Altman said, was for someone flipping channels
to think they had tuned into live coverage of a military trial,
then discover it was his play.
   ``I made a court martial,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Altman, the director of the film version of ``M-A-S-H'' and a
number of other critically acclaimed movies, said he received a
letter from Wouk, praising his treatment.
   ``He thought it was the greatest thing that ever happened to his
`Caine Mutiny,''' Altman said.

   President Corazon Aquino's son has
been called to active military service and has been urged by his
mother to accept the 30-day draft to trim his waistline, Manila
newspapers report.
   The papers, published Sunday, quoted Benigno Aquino III as
saying he received the notice last year but could not comply
because of injuries sustained when mutinous troops attacked the
presidential palace during the Aug. 28 coup attempt.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 wounded in the
attempt, the most serious of half a dozen bids to topple Mrs.
Aquino since she came to power in February 1986.
   The 28-year-old Aquino, who works in an insurance firm, said he
received a second notice recently but was reluctant to accept
because he feared the rigidity of military training, the papers
said. So he sought advice from his mother, who urged him to undergo
military training if only to trim his waistline.
   ``You have no wife and no children, yet your belly is so big it
makes you look like a father,'' Aquino quoted his mother as saying.
   He said he has been assigned to a Philippine Air Force unit with
the rank of master sergeant, but did not say when he will begin
training.

<HEAD>Dingell: Weak Bolts Causing `Serious Problems' in Two Army Units</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has ``serious problems'' in two of
its front-line units because of continuing problems with weak bolts
in some vehicles, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Sunday.
   The problem may be even more extensive than that because the two
units received their bolts from the same depots that supply other
Army units, both here and overseas, said Dingell, chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Dingell also heads the investigations subcommittee, which held
widely publicized hearings last August revealing problems of bolts
and fasteners that weren't as strong as expected.
   The result is that wheel assemblies on some Army vehicles, such
as trucks and the all-purpose ``Hum-V,'' may come lose, according
to testimony that will be presented Monday to the investigations
subcommittee during a follow-up hearing.
   A subcommittee staff report said the problem fasteners were
still found in large numbers in vehicles of the 7th Infantry
division at Fort Ord, Calif., and the 9th Regiment at Fort Carson,
Colo.
   Tansill Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Army Material Command,
which oversees the depots that supply the bolts, admitted the
service is still having problems.
   ``We're very concerned about this,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``We have
been remiss in not educating soldiers at the lowest level about
using the right grade of bolts.''
   But she noted that in a series of tests, ``we've found that many
of the bolts are still effective, even though they are substandard
compared to contract specifications.''
   The subcommittee staff report noted that ``the vehicles of the
units we visited contained a number of fasteners from foreign
manufacturers whose bolts had previously been found substandard in
numerous laboratory tests.''
   ``The combat units were experiencing severe fastener problems on
their vehicles to the extent that the combat readiness of some
units was affected,'' it said.
   Because the fasteners were not as strong as they should have
been, some of them came lose in front wheel assemblies of the
Hum-V, the investigators found. ``This caused tire wear, fastener
failure, and if not corrected, loss of steering.''
   In a check of the 9th Regiment, half of the 102 Hum-Vs checked
had loose fasteners and seven had been lost from service because
the problem was so severe, the subcommittee investigators found.
   One officer got so frustrated with trying to get the right
fasteners that he ``bought replacement bolts from the civilian
economy with money from his own pocket in order to get the unit's
vehicles ready. By a stroke of luck, he obtained domestic bolts at
the local hardware store,'' the report said.
   Part of the problem is that bolts are stored in a variety of
bins and the containers aren't always clearly marked, according to
Ms. Johnson.
   The subcommittee investigators agreed, reporting that Army
maintenance personnel ``admitted that over 50 percent of their bins
contained fasteners of unknown quality and complained that they
were not receiving sufficient information to purge the suspect
fasteners.''

<HEAD>Travels With Jackson: Stranded Bus, Barbs At Bush and Lingering
Racism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A familiar Jesse Jackson line _ ``They take the early bus'' _
took on a new meaning for reporters traveling with the Jackson
presidential campaign in California last week.
   Jackson regularly makes the statement when referring to the
working poor as a way to illustrate that many poor people are
hardworking but still can't make a decent living.
   On Friday, the press bus broke down en route from a Jackson
rally in San Pedro to another in Santa Monica. Jackson's limousine,
motorcyle escort and the rest of the motorcade disappeared up the
Harbor Freeway, while the bus limped to the shoulder, disabled by a
transmission problem, it was established later.
   The staff called for another bus as the reporters fumed about
being stranded. An argument ensued among the driver, Secret Service
agent and a camera crew that wanted to get out and film the stalled
bus.
   The camera crew stayed inside. The new bus arrived after about
10 minutes and fought its way through freeway traffic to Santa
Monica.
   Jackson, meanwhile, had arrived and saw another reporter who had
been riding in a separate press van while her colleagues languished
on the roadside.
   When he asked how she got there so soon, the reporter told
Jackson, ``I took the early bus.''

   Jesse Jackson has been getting a lot of mileage out of
belittling George Bush lately. He has not had to look far for
ammunition.
   A recent favorite: he quotes an April 30 New York Times story in
which Bush was asked about reports that he has sought the
resignation of embattled Attorney Gen. Edwin Meese.
   Bush was quoted as replying, ``I deny I have ever given my
opinion to anybody.''
   The line gets a big laugh when Jackson repeats it, as he did in
Atlanta several thousand unionists attending a machinists
convention last week.
   As far as Bush being in the driver's seat, Jackson came across
another news story describing a Bush photo opportunity for the
press.
   Bush decided to drive a Jeep, as Jackson tells it, to improve
his image of toughness, ``so it would look like he was going to
take America someplace.''
   At this point in the story, Jackson pauses for effect.
   ``Bush,'' he says, ``got in on the rider's side.''

   Jesse Jackson often talks about crossing lines of race, sex and
religion to find common ground among disparate groups.
   But he had his work cut out for him in Parma, Ohio, a
predominantly white, blue-collar suburb of Cleveland where racist
attitudes were voiced openly by some.
   An elderly woman said she could not support the black minister
because ``I'd rather have our man in there, one of ours, you know
what I mean.'' When the reporter asked what she meant, she replied,
``I'd rather have a white person.''
   One elderly man told a reporter he did not think Jackson would
get much support around here because ``People don't want a black
president. It will turn the country around.''
   A union representative told another reporter that black people
don't want to work very hard.
   The comments were made in impromptu interviews with people
attending a rowdy popcorn-and-beer fund raiser for for Rep. Mary
Rose Okar, D-Ohio last week.
   The sea of white faces Jackson found when he entered the union
hall was not unusual for him. Around the country, many whites
attend his rallies and he has an active blue-collar following.
   But this was not his crowd. There was a constant din as he spoke
and many, having heard Okar earlier, walked out or lined up at the
beer counter in the back during Jackson's speech.

<HEAD>Finding The Vice President Piece in the Electoral College Puzzle</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS last graf to fix typo in Kassebaum</NOTE>

   For Michael Dukakis and George Bush, picking a
vice presidential nominee is a key step in putting together the
pieces of the Electoral College puzzle, as strategists try to fit
the person to the political geography.
   Should Dukakis pick a Southern senator as his running mate to
help the Democrats win in the region this fall?
   ``It just doesn't work when we go with two Northerners on the
ticket,'' says Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
   Should Bush name California Gov. George Deukmejian to the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket to grab the biggest state's votes on Nov. 8?
   ``The Democrats must beat us in California to have a chance,''
said Republican consultant Vincent Breglio.
   The pieces of the Electoral College puzzle are states, each
offering a prize of electoral votes toward the goal of 270, the
majority needed to win the White House.
   The choice of a running mate _ always a tough decision _ is
complicated in 1988 because Ronald Reagan has helped redraw the
political contours of the country:
   _ The once solidly Democratic South is now viewed as one of
Bush's two strongholds _ along with the Mountain states of the West.
   _ With Reagan not on the ticket, California will be very
competitive with a prize of 47 electoral votes.
   _ The farm states of the Midwest, long GOP bastions, are ripe
for Democratic appeals after years of Reagan agriculture policies
that have left the region feeling battered.
   _ The big industrial states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and the like are shaping up as very close battles.
   Dukakis, the odds-on favorite for the Democratic presidential
nomination, must put his piece of the puzzle down first, when the
Democratic National Convention meets in Atlanta in July. Then Bush
can look over the full opposition ticket before making a decision
at the GOP convention in New Orleans in August.
   Historically, vice presidential candidates aren't the most
important factor in an election win, but they do count.
   ``I think it gets you the state where the running mate is from,
but not much more,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic activist and
political scientist, citing various studies.
   ``Nobody is going to carry a region as a vice presidential
nominee,'' argues Robert Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984
campaign.
   But that much wider impact is the keystone of the argument from
those who are pushing a Southerner for Dukakis's running mate.
Democrats making this argument say that the only times the party
has won the White House since 1952 was with a Southerner on board
and a good showing in the region, which sports 182 electoral votes.
   ``Dukakis needs a Southern senator as a running mate, not
another governor,'' said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton on Friday in
saying he should not be the running mate.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is the prime candidate under this
scenario, since he is a conservative Democrat and chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. But others mentioned as well are
former presidential hopeful Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Sen.
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas.
   ``Is Sam Nunn going to bring us the rest of the South?'' asked
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ``He's not very well known
outside of Georgia. Of course, he will make an appeal ... but he
will be overshadowed by the top of the ticket.''
   A non-Southerner who could have appeal in the South is Sen. John
Glenn of Ohio, whose military background, ex-astronaut status and
moderate views would have appeal in the region. And perhaps as
importantly, Glenn is popular in his home state with its 23
electoral votes.
   While the South is important, almost everyone agrees that the
West Coast is critical.
   ``California is the key,'' said Democratic consultant John
Russonello.
   ``California is not a Republican anchor. It's very much up for
grabs,'' said GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin.
   The state's 47 electoral votes are the biggest prize in the
general election, almost one-fifth of the majority needed.
   Deukmejian, the state's popular governor and a Bush backer, has
always been high on the lists of possible GOP nominees. But there
is a major drawback: if Deukmejian won the vice presidency, he
would have to turn the governor's chair over to a Democrat.
   ``It is impossible,'' said GOP consultant Lance Tarrance,
``because of his sincere and intense interest in running the state
of California.''
   But the GOP choice will also be shaped by the Democratic moves.
   A Southern choice by the Democrats would ``open up the
opportunity to do some cherry-picking in the Midwest,'' explains
Wirthlin. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh and Illinois
Gov. Jim Thompson are two names mentioned.
   In contrast, a Midwestern choice by the opposition might send
the GOP rushing to Deukmejian.
   But then there is Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, the former GOP
presidential hopeful with strong California ties and a message of
economic optimism that Tarrance said would be appealing in the
Midwest.
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is the most often
mentioned southerner among the Republicans, if Bush decided to
shore up his base there. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming gets
mentioned as a possible Western candidate.
   A completely different approach for the Republicans would be to
choose a woman for the No. 2 spot, as the Democrats did with
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
   While choosing former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole,
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas or former United Nations Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick would have impact in their home states, the
larger goal would be to narrow the ``gender gap'' of negative
women's opinions that has hurt the GOP since 1980.

   After sparking three consecutive nights of
violence, Iowa State University's annual spring festival faces an
overhaul in order to curb excessive drinking, school officials and
student organizers of the festival agree.
   ``We're looking to work with the university and city to see what
changes we can make,'' said Curt Ford, a sophomore from Geneseo,
Ill., who is on the committee for the Veishea festival, an annual
long weekend of student activities.
   Early Sunday, eight law officers were injured and 45 people were
arrested as student celebrations coinciding with Veishea concluded.
There were two arrests early Friday and nine early Saturday.
   ``This certainly mars what has been a very good weekend for
Veishea. But we're going to have to reassess the whole Veishea
activity ... and the amount of time students have off,'' said
Thomas Thielen, university vice president of student affairs.
   He was on the scene early Sunday as raucous students set fires
in streets and pelted officers and police vehicles with rocks and
bottles.
   Student organizers of the 66th annual Veishea festival disavowed
the rioting, saying it was not connected with any formal activities
that included a parade on Saturday that was followed by the
football team's spring game. occurred. The event was named by
taking the first letter in the name of each of Iowa State's
original colleges.
   ``We've been trying to promote the non-alcoholic aspect of
Veishea this year,'' Ford said later Sunday. ``We don't know why
things got out of hand.'' Helmeted police clashed with an estimated
crowd of 2,000 early Sunday in the heart of campus, where bonfires
were fed by sofas and other furniture carried by beer-drinking
revelers.
   Nightly disturbances at the annual spring festival started
Thursday and grew progressively worse before the festival ended
Sunday. Like the previous two nights, the latest disturbance
appeared to start with private parties.
   ``It was pretty ugly for a while,'' said Ames Police Chief
Dennis Ballantine. ``Frankly, I haven't seen anything like this
since the early 1970s and the Vietnam war protests.
   ``The only difference is those people had a legitimate gripe.
These people didn't. They were just drunk.''
   As state, county and city law enforcement officers helped
firefighters move in to put out the fires Sunday, they were pelted
with bottles and rocks thrown by crowd members. Two police cars
were damaged when hit by concrete blocks.
   At least two people in the crowd were burned, but not seriously,
said police dispatcher Pam Roberts.
   When law officers had little success persuading the crowd to
disperse, the school's popular basketball coach, Johnny Orr, came
to campus after 3 a.m. and pleaded with students to go home. Orr
warned them their actions were damaging the school's reputation.
   The crowd broke up a short time later.
   Most of the 45 people arrested were charged with inciting to
riot, an aggravated misdemeanor.
   Eight officers were treated and released at Mary Greeley
Hospital, with two requiring stitches to close wounds.
   The violence erupted as dozens of officers from the Ames police
department, the Story County sheriff's department, the state patrol
and campus security lined both sides of Welch Avenue, a strip of
taverns and small shops, escorting firefighters to the bonfires.

<TEXT>
   The animosity between Saudi Arabia and
Iran that has led to their recent diplomatic split is rooted in a
centuries-old schism in the Moslem world between the Sunni and
Shiite sects.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran,
which is predominantly Shiite, dragged the religious feud into the
20th century, sparking new fears among the conservative,
Sunni-dominated Persian Gulf states and other Arab countries.
   The revolution's triumph in toppling the pro-Western Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi also fueled Islamic fervor among
fundamentalist Sunnis.
   That, along with the vigorous Shiite challenge, has ignited
violence from socialist Syria to monarchist Morocco in the last
decade.
   The Islamic resurgence has brought a religious intensity not
witnessed since the Middle Ages and has perplexed and alarmed the
West.
   While the Saudis cited terrorism and threats for breaking
relations with Tehran on April 27, they mainly were seeking to head
off Iranian-inspired violence in the holy city of Mecca in this
year's annual haj, or pilgrimage.
   More than 400 pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians, were killed in
rioting in Mecca last year that shocked the Moslem world. Iran
vowed revenge and Khomeini called for the overthrow of Saudi
Arabia's royal family.
   The Saudis want to avoid a repetition of the violence this year
by getting Moslem countries to scale down the number of pilgrims
they send. Iran, asked to trim its contingent of the usual 150,000
by about one-third, refuses.
   Instead, Iran has revived calls for an Islamic crusade against
Saudi Arabia and stripping the royal family of custodianship of
Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca, Prophet Mohammed's birthplace,
and in Medina, where he is buried.
   The guardianship of these holy sites is one of the underpinnings
of the Saudi monarchy that gives it political legitimacy in the
eyes of most Moslems.
   The deepening hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia has been
exacerbated by the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, in which the Saudis
have supported Arab Iraq against Persian Iran.
   The Arabs and Persians, separated by language and culture, have
been religious rivals since the death of Mohammed, the founder of
Islam, in 632 A.D.
   The Sunnis, who make up more than 90 percent of the world's 850
million Moslems, revere Mohammed as second only to God and view Abu
Bakr, the prophet's father-in-law and the man who became Islam's
first caliph, as his rightful successor.
   The mystical Shiites consider Mohammed's cousin and son-in-law,
Ali, the fourth caliph, and 11 of his descendants to be the true
heirs of the faith. They revere all 12 as imams, or saints, and
believe the 12th imam, Mehdi, will return like a messiah to bring
justice to the world.
   Ali was assassinated in 661 amid a power struggle by two
factions over who would lead the Moslem world following Mohammed's
death.
   Ali's death confirmed the Sunni Umayyad dynasty in power as the
Caliphs, or successors of the prophet. Ali's descendants remained
in perpetual revolt, claiming to be the true Caliphate and refusing
to accept orthodox teachings espoused by the Sunnis.
   Ali's son, Hussein, led one rebellion and was massacred with his
handful of outnumbered followers in the Battle of Karbala, in what
is now Iraq, in 680.
   Ever since, the minority Shiites were considered heretics. Only
in Iran, where for political motives a 16th century shah embraced
Shiitism as the established creed, did the downtrodden sect
flourish.
   Every year, when they mark the death of Hussein, militant
Shiites flagellate themselves with chains and swords in a
passionate celebration of the martyr _ acts which Sunnis regard as
demeaning.
   For Khomeini and his followers, their revolution was the dawn of
a new age of Islamic fundamentalism as a powerful force in the
world, the time of reckoning after 1,300 years of subjugation.
   The revival stems in part from Moslems rebelling against the
Western influence that colonialism brought and oil wealth
intensified in the last two decades, transforming what were feudal
societies and eroding cultural values. In this vacuum,
fundamentalism has taken root.
   Khomeini's belief that Iran is the beacon for a fundamentalist
revival that will sweep the world and his drive to export the
revolution has caused mayhem among the monarchies of the Persian
Gulf who believe themselves vulnerable.
   The Iran-Iraq war has only heightened the passions.
   Tiny Kuwait, which is closest to the war zone and under constant
threat from Iran, has cracked down hard on its Shiite militants
after a chain of terrorist attacks, including the April 5 hijacking
of a Kuwaiti jetliner by Shiite extremists. On Sunday, the
newspaper al-Anbaa called for the government to deport Shiite
Moslems who show allegiance to Iran.
   Shiites comprise about one-fourth of Kuwait's 1.9 million
population. In Bahrain, where Sunnis rule, the Shiites form about
70 percent of the population.
   Seven years ago, Bahraini authorities foiled what apparently was
a Shiite plot aimed at assassinating the ruler, Sheik Isa bin
Sulman Al-Khalifa.
   Fundamentalism inspired by Khomeini's revolution has reared up
further afield.
   Tunisia broke off relations with Tehran last year, alleging Iran
was seeking to foster an Islamic rebellion.
   Fundamentalists assassinated President Anwar Sadat of Egypt in
1980 and remain politically active there.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad crushed a rebellion by the
fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood in the city of Hama in 1982,
slaughtering as many as 30,000 people and razing much of the city.
   Saudi Arabia's decision to sever relations with Tehran has
increased the polarization between Iran's Shiite zealots and the
Arabs that the Iran-Iraq war has brought.
   But the Saudis also were throwing down the gauntlet to their
Shiite rivals only a few weeks before the haj is due to start, and
that could have dangerous consequences in their feud.

<HEAD>Polish Official Defends Actions Against Strikers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish official, responding to Reagan
administration criticism of a crackdown on labor unrest, denied
Sunday that strikers were beaten and said a government that fired
its air traffic controllers should know the difference between a
legal and an illegal strike.
   Lt. Col. Wieslaw Gornicki, Polish government political adviser,
denied news reports and U.S. government allegations of violence
against striking workers at a Krakow steel mill and accused the
news media of exaggerating and inflaming conditions in Poland.
   ``The strike was crushed, but nobody was beaten,'' Gornicki said
in an interview from Warsaw on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   ``If it all were true what your news media is reporting, we
would have a general strike, a nationwide strike of 10 days or
perhaps three months,'' Gornicki said. At least five strikes have
occurred in Poland in the past two weeks, including one at the
Lenin shipyard where negotiations were continuing between workers
and management.
   Asked about the reported use of percussion grenades to quell the
Krakow strike, which had lasted 10 days, Gornicki said he did not
believe the devices were used but added, ``I cannot rule it out.''
   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead condemned the
reported violence Saturday and announced that U.S. backing for
Poland's economic recovery program would remain frozen until the
program wins popular support. The White House twice last week also
issued statements condemning the government's reported use of force
against strikes backed by the outlawed Solidarity labor movement.
   Gornicki did not directly respond to the official U.S.
criticism. But he said, ``You know, a country which not long ago
had a certain experience with its air traffic controllers union ...
should make a clear-cut difference between a strike which is legal
... and wildcat strikes, which as you know very well are illegal.''
   President Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers after
what the government said was an illegal strike in 1981.
   Gornicki said strikes represent problems with adaptation to
``the new style of our economic life.''
   U.S. officials, including Vice President George Bush during a
visit to Poland last September, had applauded Polish steps toward
economic reform prior to the current unrest. In March, a U.S.
ambassador, John R. Davis, was posted in Warsaw for the first time
in five years.

   Jewish refusenik Vladimir Tufeld said Sunday he
had received a passport from Soviet authorities and would fly to
the United States to be with his ill wife in several days.
   Tufeld, a 60-year-old electronics engineer who had been refused
permission to emigrate for almost 11 years, said in a telephone
interview he received his passport from the Moscow visa office
Saturday. He said he planned to leave for New York on May 13.
   His 57-year-old wife, Izolda, was granted permission in late
December to travel to the United States for surgery to remove a
brain tumor. She remains in Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore.
   Officials of the Soviet Ministry of General Machine Building
told Tufeld that he could not leave the country because he had
access to state secrets when he worked at an electronics factory in
the 1970s.
   But he said officials told him in late April they would allow
him to leave temporarily to be with his wife. Tufeld said Soviet
officials did not put any limit on the length of time he may be
abroad.

   Sikh militants wearing police uniforms
and riding a motorcyle riddled a Hindu wedding party with automatic
gunfire in one of several overnight attacks that killed 24 people,
police said Sunday.
   An Indian border patrol killed five Sikh separatists on
horseback in a river bank shootout, a news agency said. A border
patrolman was also killed.
   In the most deadly attack Saturday night, Sikh militants opened
fire from a motorcycle on the roadside wedding party of Hindu
migrants. They killed 13 people and wounded 25, but the bride and
groom were uninjured, police said.
   The attack occurred in predominantly Hindu Haryana state, which
borders the mostly Sikh northern state of Punjab where separatists
have been blamed for killing about 940 people this year. They have
been waging a guerrilla war for greater autonomy or an independent
nation in Punjab since 1982.
   The Haryana attack took place near the village of Panipat, 90
miles south of Chandigarh, capital of both Punjab and Haryana
states.
   A motorcycle carrying three Sikhs sped past the wedding party,
and at least two men opened fire with AK-47 automatic rifles,
according to Haryana police subinspector Ravinder Kakkar. Other
Sikhs in a car rode near the motorcycle but did not fire, he said.
   The attack occurred shortly after the daughter of an intinerant
metalworker was married to a man from New Delhi. The wedding party
was eating and watching a video movie when they were raked with
gunfire.
   All the assailants escaped.
   In Punjab, 11 people were killed Saturday night in several other
attacks that police blamed on militant Sikhs.
   Near the Pakistani border, the Indian patrol operating on a tip
raided a garden Sunday and surprised a band of armed militants,
according to United News of India news agency.
   Five Sikhs fled on horses along a river bank and were killed
after a heavy exchange of gunfire, the report said.
   One was identified as Surjan Singh, who police said masterminded
the massacre of 34 people at a festival March 3.
   Border guards killed another militant in a separate episode
nearby, according to the report.
   United News of India also said Sikh gunmen killed a Hindu man,
his son, daughter-in-law and grandson Saturday night in the Punjab
village of Lakhan Kalan. Two Hindu servants also were killed.
   Farther southeast, four Sikhs, including a village holy man,
were killed by militants Saturday night in Jalandar district.
   The news agency reported that Sikh militants also killed a
farmer in Gurdaspur district.
   Although a majority in Punjab, Sikhs make up less than 2 percent
of India's national population of 800 million. The Sikhs, whose
religion began 500 years ago as an alternative to Hinduism and
Islam, claim they are discriminated against by Hindus, who comprise
about 80 percent of the country's population.

   Soviet police on Sunday tried to interrupt
meetings of scores of dissidents seeking to challenge the supremacy
of the Communist Party and detained 20 people as they left one of
the gatherings, dissidents said.
   Editors of 30 non-official journals hoping to break the
government monopoly on publishing also met in Moscow to formalize
their cooperation by establishing the Independent Publications Club.
   On Saturday, 148 people attended an initial meeting to form an
alternative political party called the Democratic Union. On Sunday,
they broke into groups to discuss the party's political platform
and socio-economic and organizational questions.
   Yevgeniya Debryanskaya, who hosted the meeting about the group's
political platform, said police arrived at her north Moscow
apartment in about 30 cars Sunday evening and tried to enter.
   About 50 people were jammed in Ms. Debryanskaya's living room,
thrashing out the group's political goals.
   Ms. Debryanskaya said the group refused to let officers in, but
20 people were detained as they left. She said in a telephone
interview that she did not know what happened to them, but noted
that authorities often hold people for several hours and then
release them.
   Smaller groups discussed the party's organization and
socio-economic policies at two other Moscow apartments.
   Igor Tsarkov, leader of the organizational meeting, said a
Moscow city official accompanied by police arrived at the meeting
and asked that the group of 15 disband.
   Police asked to check their documents, but the participants
refused and police eventually left, Tsarkov said.
   Valentin Eliseyedko, head of the group on socio-economic
problems, said police also visited that meeting and checked
documents, but otherwise did not interfere.
   Ms. Debryanskaya said in an interview earlier Sunday that a
committee of 15 people had drafted political principles calling for:
   _ Multi-party, parliamentary democracy;
   _ A new constitution, replacing the current document that makes
the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force'' of Soviet
society;
   _ Independent trade unions; and
   _ Withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from Eastern European countries
and from the western Ukraine and the Baltic states, which Ms.
Debryanskaya said the group considers to be under Soviet occupation.
   The meetings of the Democratic Union and the independent
publishers group were were notable for the number of people they
drew to Moscow. Authorities have not broken up previous efforts to
hold dissident conferences, but they have closed conference
facilities and prevented some people from traveling to them.
   Many dissident groups and independent publications have sprung
up since hundreds of political prisoners were freed in 1987.
   Authorities in the past have crushed efforts to form an
opposition to the Communist Party, and despite his reform effort,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has given no indication the party will
tolerate any opposition.
   Ms. Debryanskaya said Gorbachev will allow the group to exist if
he is serious about reforms. ``Arguments and disagreements are
normal in society,'' she said.
   But any such group also faces enormous difficulties in a vast
country where the government controls printing facilities and
authorities can detain or intimidate dissidents and disrupt mail
and telephone calls.
   On Saturday, dissident sources said police surrounded the
apartment building across the street from the government offices of
the Russian republic, where the first meeting was held, but did not
break it up.
   Ms. Debryanskaya said her group will make a formal declaration
seeking official recognition of the Democratic Union and transmit
it to Moscow city authorities.
   She has been active in a group supporting greater trust between
East and West, and a second group calling itself ``Democracy and
Humanism.''
   Former political prisoners Sergei Grigoryants and Lev Timofeyev,
and other publishers of independent journals from Moscow,
Leningrad, Riga, Lvov, Pskov and Kuybyshev decided at their weekend
gatherings to form a library to preserve and help disseminate their
publications.
   Thirty publications emphasizing such topics as political
commentary, religion and women's issues were represented,
participants said. A similar meeting was held in Leningrad last
fall, and the group agreed to hold another large conference in
Moscow in October.
   Some of the publications have sought official approval, but none
has been given.
   Participants in the editors' gathering said police checked
documents of people who arrived at the south Moscow apartment on
Saturday, but no police or plainclothes officers were visible
Sunday.

<HEAD>Civil Libertarian Says Coast Guard Drug Policy Unfair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD W. SWINTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weekend seizure of a $2.5 million yacht after
less than one-tenth of an ounce of marijuana was found on board is
a headline-grabbing scare tactic that violates common sense, a
civil libertarian said Sunday.
   But the U.S. Coast Guard's seizure of boats like the 133-foot
Ark Royal was meant to make an impact.
   ``This new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who
is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our
waterways,'' Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said when he
announced the ``Zero Tolerance'' policy here two weeks ago.
   But Mary Coombs, a member of the Miami chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the policy sets a dangerous precedent.
   ``To take somebody's property from them for something they
probably couldn't control'' is excessive, she said Sunday.
   The Ark Royal, registered in Delaware and operated only by a
crew of six employees, was boarded Saturday in international waters
in the Yucatan Channel between Mexico and Cuba. Neither its
registered owner, Michael J. Rogerson, described by the Coast Guard
as the president and chief shareholder of Tomima Corp., nor any
passengers were on board, said Coast Guard Lt. John Felker.
   A boarding party from the cutter Tampa noticed a tiny bit of
marijuana residue in a trash can during a friendly document check.
The resulting search revealed a little marijuana tucked in the
dresser of a stateroom, Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz said.
   ``At this point the person who owned the contraband has not come
forward,'' Felker said. The crew will probably be released
uncharged when they arrive at the Key West Coast Guard station,
expected during the night, he said. The yacht was to be impounded.
   ``We have been focusing all of our efforts in recent years on
just the big smugglers, but drugs are a two-way street,'' Diaz
said. ``This is the time we're making the users pay. It really has
to hurt to see a luxury yacht taken away for what basically amounts
to one joint.''
   Asked if it didn't seem harsh to take away the boat under those
circumstances, Felker said, ``Zero tolerance means exactly that,
without regards to the size of the vessel or of value of the
vessel.''
   ``A U.S.-flagged vessel is U.S. territory anywhere in the world.
We have authority to enforce U.S. laws over that vessel anywhere in
the world except in the territorial seas of a foreign state. Even
then we may be granted authority by that foreign state,'' Felker
said.
   The Reagan administration is stretching the law with its seizure
policy, said Ms. Coombs.
   Congress may have passed a law that permits confiscation of
property used in drug trafficking, but ``that's not the same as
saying Congress had in mind that they would have a Zero Tolerance
policy,'' she said.
   It violates a sense of ``proportionality,'' Ms. Coombs said.
``It's putting people at enormous risk with no very effective way
of protecting themselves, and as a civil libertarian I am troubled
by that kind of policy.''
   ``My guess is the Coast Guard is going to fight pretty hard on
this one,'' she said. ``It's going to have enormous symbolic
value.''
   The previously most-expensive vessel confiscated under the
program was a $300,000 yacht seized off Lake Worth, said Diaz.
   Efforts to reach Rogerson for comment Sunday were unsuccessful.
There was no listing under that name in Delaware or Miami. There
was a person with that name in Philadelphia, but he had an unlisted
number. Efforts to find a listing for a Tomima Corp. were also
unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Mothers Day Sets Stage For Vigil Seeking Greater Role, Priesthood
For Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters denouncing the Roman Catholic Church's
``hypocrisy'' of honoring women on Mother's Day while denying them
the priesthood staged a peaceful vigil Sunday outside Holy Name
Cathedral.
   A smaller group of demonstrators, some carrying pictures of Pope
John Paul II, gathered to reinforce church teachings that women
cannot be priests.
   About 40 members and supporters of a group called Chicago
Catholic Women stood outside the cathedral, home pulpit of Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin, holding signs including one which said: ``We want
a church for our daughters.''
   The demonstrators, who included a handful of men, passed out
fliers urging parishioners to boycott regular services and to
attend an alternate service later at a North Side women's center.
   ``There's something to tradition,'' said Gerry Gorman, 35, who
was carrying her 10-month-old son, Gabriel. ``There's also
something to ending an unjust system.''
   Another demonstrator was Debra Graves, 32, of Woodridge, who
said she has a master's degree in divinity from Harvard and would
likely go into the priesthood if allowed.
   ``I'm ready,'' she said. ``My church is not.''
   Hundreds of parishioners and visitors attended the morning
Mother's Day Mass inside Holy Name while the demonstrators stood
outside.
   Nanci Mayhoefer, 43, of Chicago was among about 10 demonstrators
against ordination of women.
   ``Tradition is a very strong part of our church,'' Mrs.
Mayhoefer said. In performing part of the church service, the
priest ``takes the place of Christ,'' and a woman can't play that
role, she said.
   Ms. Gorman, of Chicago, said the vigil was planned because the
issue of women and the church is ``tearing the church apart'' and
was not given serious consideration by bishops who attended last
fall's Synod on the Laity at the Vatican.
   Her group's flier said the church shows ``hypocrisy'' on
Mother's Day.
   ``This is the day on which the institutional church `honors' its
women,'' it said. ``By our absence we hope to demonstrate our
frustration with such tokenism.''
   Marie Knoll, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Chicago,
issued a statement on the issue before Sunday's protest.
   ``The recent pastoral letter by the U.S. bishops responding to
the concerns of women clearly acknowledges that more needs to be
done to recognize and incorporate the insights and talents of women
as partners in the church,'' she said.
   Irene McCartin, 42, a parishioner from Olympia Fields, seemed to
agree with the archdiocese view.
   ``For some families, it's really one time to get together,'' she
said of Mother's Day. The demonstration, she said, ``takes away
from it.''
   But another parishioner, Barbara Malewicki, 46, of Lansing, was
not offended. ``I think there's merit in what they have to say, and
it should be talked about, not dismissed,'' she said.

   Kristen Knouse doesn't think there's
anything special about a blind person riding a horse in a national
college equestrian competition. But she had to fight for a chance
to prove that.
   The blind Rutgers University student has been riding horses,
using her sense of hearing to guide her, since she was 10 years old.
   ``It's easy. I can hear the horse's feet echo off the rail,''
Miss Knouse, 19, said in a telephone interview Sunday from her
hotel room in Laurinburg, site of Sunday's 15th Intercollegiate
National Championship Horse Show.
   Later in the day, she placed fourth out of 12 riders in the
walk-trot equitation class.
   A day earlier, the freshman persuaded organizers to reverse
their earlier decision and let her compete.
   Although she qualified for the competition by winning a regional
collegiate contest last month in Horsham, Pa., organizers last week
disqualified her from the national show, saying a blind rider could
be dangerous to other riders.
   The ruling surprised Miss Knouse, who has competed for two
semesters on the Rutgers equestrian team.
   ``You see, I've never been kept out of anything before _ not
even when I was a kid,'' she said.
   She competes in a type of riding called ``hunt seat,'' in which
riders in traditional English-style attire demonstrate various
gaits as they go around the show ring and are judged on their form.
She said she's tried her hand at jumping, but only in practice
sessions.
   The disqualification also surprised her parents and teammates on
the Rutgers equestrian squad, who accompanied her to North Carolina
on Friday to protest the ruling.
   The North Carolina branch of American Civil Liberties Union also
came to her aid, calling the disqualification discriminatory.
   An attorney for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association said
the initial decision to disqualify Miss Knouse was based primarily
on insurance concerns and the safety of other riders.
   ``Discrimination is not at issue,'' said attorney John MacCrate.
   About 260 riders from colleges around the United States competed
Saturday and Sunday in the event at St. Andrews Presbyterian
College.
   Miss Knouse, from Medford, N.J., said she usually competes with
``spotters,'' people posted around the horse show ring to warn her
of corners and obstacles.
   Show officials ruled Thursday that the spotters violated
competition rules, while Miss Knouse's riding without them might
endanger other riders.
   But on Saturday, after putting Miss Knouse and her mount through
paces in a private corral at the horse show farm, the show
officials relented.
   They decided to let a friend of Miss Krouse run alongside her
while she rode in the show ring in the walk-trot class, but without
any verbal communication between horsewoman and helper.
   ``She certainly is comfortable on a horse. It went very, very
smoothly yesterday,'' said Shelby French, who owns the farm where
the show was held and coaches the equestrian team at St. Andrews.
   Miss Knouse, who has been blind since birth, said she mounted
her first horse at age 10 at a riding academy near her home. She
quickly adjusted to the different gaits, while her sense of hearing
and the riding instructor helped her guide the animal.
   Later, she practiced on the family horse, Rhannon, riding at
home in a large circle at the end of a long rope held by her father.
   ``I know Rhannon's gaits really well,'' she said. ``But I've
ridden strange horses so many times.''
   William Simpson, an attorney for the ACLU in North Carolina,
said he was glad show officials finally recognized Miss Knouse's
rights.
   ``At first, like most people, they just didn't see how she could
do it,'' Simpson said. ``But I think a fair evaluation with a
sensitivity to her efforts to overcome her blindness was all she
ever asked for.''

<TEXT>
   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief of
staff, on Sunday portrayed President Reagan as a hesitant and
unassertive chief executive controlled by a scheming,
image-conscious first lady who depended heavily upon an
astrologer's stargazing predictions.
   Regan offered a sometimes bitter account of his stormy days at
the White House in a memoir, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington,'' published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and scheduled
to go on sale in bookstores on Monday.
   ``Virtually ever major move and decision the Reagans made during
my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with a
woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that
the planets were in a favorable alignments for the enterprise,''
Regan wrote.
   He did not identify the woman, saying Nancy Reagan referred to
her only as ``Friend.'' But Time magazine, which carried excerpts
of the book in its new issue, said, ``She is Nob Hill Socialite
Joan Quigley, sixtyish, a Vassar graduate who has written three
books on astrology.''
   Ms. Quigley, a wealthy Republican whose specialty is politics,
is a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin show. She has been
practicing astrology since the 1960s and has written several books
on the subject.
   Reached by the San Francisco Chronicle last week on vacation in
Paris, she acknowledged she has known the Reagans for years, but
refused to comment on whether they had ever been her clients.
   ``I never say who my clients are. Never. It is very
confidential,'' she said.
   Asked if it would be wrong to say she was the Reagans'
astrologer, she said: ``I won't comment on that. I can't comment.''
   The Reagans had no comment Sunday afternoon when they alighted
from the helicopter that brought them from Camp David, Md., where
they had spent the weekend. Reagan pointed to his ear, indicating
he could not hear questions shouted at him by reporters; Mrs.
Reagan appeared cool and unsmiling, but said nothing.
   On Friday, however, Reagan expressed irritation about Regan's
book, the latest in a series of ``kiss and tell'' books about
Reagan's presidency. ``He's chosen to attack my wife and I don't
look kindly upon that at all,'' Reagan said.
   For a time, Regan says he was kept in the dark about Mrs.
Reagan's secret, closely held by a handful of aides since Reagan's
days as the governor of California.
   But after repeated clashes with the first lady over schedules,
longtime Reagan aide Michael Deaver told the chief of staff about
the woman and advised Regan to ``humor'' the first lady, he said.
   ``At one point, I kept a color-coded calendar on my desk
(numerals highlighted in green ink for `good' days, red for `bad'
days, yellow for `iffy' days) as an aid to remembering when it was
propitious to move the president of the United States from one
place to another, or schedule him to speak in public, or commence
negotiations with a foreign power,'' Regan wrote.
   Mrs. Reagan liked to chat with the woman every Saturday from
Camp David, he said. The advice from the soothsayer, coupled with a
concern by Nancy Reagan for the president's health that Regan
described as ``excessive,'' caused particular problems when the
Iran-Contra scandal broke and prostate surgery required a time of
recuperation, the former chief of staff recalled.
   Regan described Mrs. Reagan as presiding over ``a shadowy
distaff presidency'' and using ``adroit guerrilla actions'' to
achieve goals in ``a genuine belief that she was the best judge of
her husband's interests.''
   ``Mrs. Reagan regarded herself as the president's alter ego not
only in the conjugal but also in the political and official
dimensions, as if the office that had been bestowed upon her
husband by the people somehow fell into the category of worldly
goods covered by the marriage vows,'' he wrote.
   ``The president's view of the situation was never discussed,''
he said. ``The fact that he permitted it to exist, and that he
never reversed any of the situations created by his wife's
intervention, was regarded as sufficient evidence that he was
willing to tolerate the state of affairs.''
   Regan pressed the first lady to allow the president to speak out
on the Iran-Contra affair, telling her, ``We need a press
conference, public appearances, speeches.''
   ``A full month after the president's release from the hospital,
his schedule was still a dead letter because Mrs. Reagan's `Friend'
had not provided a list of auspicious days. The whole month
appeared inauspicious for the president,'' Regan wrote.
   After consulting with her ``Friend,'' the first lady provided
some possible dates, Regan wrote. But her advice was not always
heeded. Regan wrote that Mrs. Reagan appeared to want to delay the
president's July 1985 surgery for suspected cancer of the colon
because of her astrological concerns, but the president overruled
any delay.
   Regan quoted the president saying, ``Why wait? Do the test and
go ahead with the operation.''
   But Mrs. Reagan's influence hardly stopped at such lesser
matters as scheduling trips or speeches, Regan said. In his
account, she was the one who decreed that Vice President George
Bush and national security adviser Robert McFarlane be barred from
Reagan's hospital bed for days following his cancer surgery.
   And the president's longtime friendship with CIA Director
William J. Casey did not prevent the first lady from pressing for
his ouster, even as he lay recuperating from brain cancer surgery
at Christmastime 1986, Regan contended in one of his many
descriptions of their telephone conversations.
   ``Mrs. Reagan, who had already shown signs of irritability, now
became angry. ... `You're more interested in protecting Bill Casey
than in protecting Ronnie!' she cried. `He's got to go. He can't do
his job; he's an embarrassment to Ronnie. He should be out,'''
Regan quoted the first lady as insisting.
   And, Reagan asserted, the first lady not only chose the speech
writer for such vital addresses as the State of the Union, but also
heavily edited them.
   ``I don't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' he quotes
Mrs. Reagan as saying when she demanded that passages referring to
abortion be deleted.
   Regan contended he was ousted by an effort organized at the
hands of Mrs. Reagan and several of her close associates, and he
barely has a kind word for the first lady in the 379-page book.
   Regan portrayed Reagan as a president who ``laid down no rules
and articulated no mission.'' At the same time, he told of
instances in which Reagan held lengthy discussions with aides on
complicated legislation, bills or administration efforts to push
budget cuts through Capitol Hill.
   But Mrs. Reagan emerged in the book as Regan's foremost target.
He paints her as an easily irritated ``constant telephone
presence,'' who constantly meddled in administration affairs.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prison guards voted by a huge majority
Sunday to end their first national strike after three weeks.
   The 1,900 guards struck April 15 in a dispute over scheduling.
The government used 1,000 police officers and 300 soldiers as
temporary guards.
   A spokesman for the Irish Prison Officers' Association, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the guards voted 1,140-159 to
accept an offer for an independent review of new shift arrangements.
   Irish Justice Minister Gerry Collins welcomed Sunday's vote and
said talks would be held with guards Monday to arrange a return to
work.
   The union had said the shifts were imposed without consultation.
It also said it wanted government money earmarked for overtime to
be used instead to recruit more prison staff.
   But the Department of Justice said the dispute centered on a
demand by guards for compensation for overtime payments they lost
last year when extra prison staff was recruited.
   Ireland's 11 prisons house about 2,000 inmates.

   The Israeli Supreme Court on Sunday temporarily
blocked the deportation of an Arab-American advocate of civil
disobedience and gave the government three days to explain its
expulsion order.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, protests erupted over army orders
that 300,000 Palestinians obtain new identity cards.
   An Israeli Cabinet member called for legislation limiting the
defense minister's powers to order military actions. The move came
after last week's Israeli incursion into Lebanon in which three
Israeli soldiers died.
   Supreme Court Justice Shoshana Netanyahu delayed for three days
the deportation order against Mubarak Awad, who filed his appeal
Sunday. He was to have been deported at midnight.
   Ms. Netanyahu ordered the government to explain its order and
also scheduled a hearing Monday on a request that Awad be released
from jail, court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said.
   Awad has been on a hunger strike since his arrest Thursday. In a
statement, he said he was defending ``the right of all
Jerusalemites to continue to live peacefully in their homeland
regardless of their opinions.''
   ``For Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Shamir to say that I, a
Christian, will be forever prevented from returning to my city of
Jerusalem to pray in my holy places is totally unacceptable,'' he
said.
   Awad's wife, Nancy Nye, read the statement to reporters.
   Israel radio said Secretary of State George P. Shultz sent
Shamir a personal message protesting the deportation order against
Awad, a proponent of non-violent resistance to Israel's 21-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment on the
report, and a spokesman for Shamir said the prime minister had not
received Shultz's message.
   The Israeli government has accused Awad, 44, of inciting
violence during the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories. By U.N. count, 184 Palestinians and two
Israelis have been killed since the violence began Dec. 8.
   On Friday, after issuing the deportation order, the government
alleged Awad helped prepare leaflets urging youths to throw
firebombs and stones.
   Jonathan Kuttab, a lawyer for Awad, said the appeal was based
primarily on ``the inherent right of Jerusalemites, Palestinian
Arabs, to continue to reside in (Arab) east Jerusalem.''
   The Jerusalem-born Awad left for the United States in 1968 and
returned in 1985 to found the Palestinian Center for the Study of
Non-Violence.
   The government refused to renew his Israeli-issued residence
permit last August. In November, the government also rejected his
plea for the renewal of a tourist visa.
   Israel radio said the Palestine Liberation Organization has
pressured Awad not to appeal the deportation because such a move
would imply acceptance of Israeli rule.
   When asked about the report, Kuttab said only that the existence
of differing opinions in the Palestinian community was well known.
   Demonstrations broke out in at least six towns and refugee camps
in the Gaza Strip against military orders that residents apply for
new ID cards.
   The military has seized cards to force residents to pay back
taxes, utility bills and other government fees. Non-payment of
taxes and other fees is a major tactic in the uprising.
   Palestinians in the occupied territories are required to carry
the cards at all times. They are frequently stopped by soldiers and
asked to show them and are subject to arrest if caught without a
card.
   In the Beach refugee camp, police fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse protesters. At least 23 people were treated at
the camp's U.N. clinic and nearby Al Shifa hospital for injuries
and the effects of tear gas, doctors said.
   A military source denied the new rules were designed to force
people to pay the outstanding bills.
   ``It's time to replace the ID cards because there are many old
ones, torn ones, without pictures. You cannot see exactly what's
written on them,'' said the source, who spoke on condtion of
anonymity.
   The source said cards would only be renewed in Gaza, not in the
West Bank. He did not elaborate.
   Scattered Palestinian protests were reported in the West Bank.
Arab reporters said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse about 200 Arabs in Ramallah. No injuries were reported.
   During Sunday's regular Cabinet meeting, Energy Minister Moshe
Shahal of the Labor Party proposed draft legislation aimed at
limiting the defense minister's powers to decide on military
operations without consulting the 24-member Cabinet.
   Cabinet members have complained that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, also a Labor member, did not inform them of the scope of the
army's Lebanon action last week.
   Rabin and several other Cabinet members defended the action,
saying it stayed within the framework of defending Israel's
northern border.

<HEAD>Banks To Allow Limited Withdrawals For First Time in Nine Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under government pressure, Panama's
banks prepared to allow customers to make limited withdrawals from
their accounts Monday for the first time in more than nine weeks.
   A government order shut down banks on March 3 following a run on
savings by panicky depositors and the imposition of U.S. economic
sanctions in an effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
resign as commander of the Defense Forces.
   The sanctions, including the freezing of an estimated $50
million of government funds in U.S. accounts, helped produce a
severe cash shortage in Panama, which uses the U.S. dollar as its
currency.
   After rejecting earlier government orders to resume operations
with restrictions, some financial institutions agreed to reopen on
April 18 to accept deposits. A week later, the government allowed
them to expand transactions, but cash withdrawals were still barred.
   Meanwhile, the government refused to allow Panamanian lawyer
Rogelio Cruz to re-enter the country. He had recently arranged bail
for some members of the opposition National Civic Crusade.
   Cruz' wife, Marcela de Cruz, said her husband was put on a plane
leaving Panama when he tried to return Saturday from Costa Rica.
She said Cruz was taken to a security office and told ``absolutely
nothing'' before he was expelled.
   Some Civic Crusade leaders have been hiding for weeks after
security forces raided their offices and homes.
   Several opposition leaders have been refused re-entry or
expelled during the 11-month-long political crisis and then allowed
to return later.
   Panamanians, unable to cash their paychecks, have conducted
business on a barter or cash-only basis since the closing of the
banks. Public employees have received government checks in small
denominations which they can use to buy groceries or pay utility
bills.
   Supermarkets that take the checks use them to pay utility bills
and taxes.
   Bankers and government officials agreed after a series of
negotiations to resume limited withdrawals beginning Monday.
   Some bankers said the compromise was little more than an attempt
to produce the image of business as usual since the cash crisis has
not eased.
   The banks ``will be open, but they will not be open,'' said Juan
Ramon Felliu, president of the Industrialists Union of Panama.
   Rules issued by the government's National Banking Commission
limit the amount Panamanians will be able to withdraw from checking
accounts to 25 percent of the balance on March 3 with a maximum of
$10,000. Money deposited after April 18 is to be free of
restrictions.
   Withdrawals from savings accounts are to be limited to $50,
beginning a month after the reopening. Withdrawals of interest are
unrestricted.
   All withdrawals are subject to the availability of cash at the
individual bank.
   The government's Caja de Ahorro bank announced it would not cash
checks for the time being. The National Bank of Panama, which
normally honors government checks, also said it would not pay out
cash.
   The Panamana Banking Association, which represents 93 of the 117
banks, most of them foreign, previously insisted its members would
not resume full services unless the government could assure an
adequate supply of U.S. dollars to back normal customer and
commercial transactions.
   Some bankers said they would abide by the agreement but insisted
that conditions still did not exist for full-service operations.
   ``If that is their thinking, they are part of the aggression
against Panama,'' Noriega said on Friday.
   Two federal grand juries in Florida indicted the general in
February on drug trafficking charges. Noriega has denied the
charges and said they are politically motivated.
   Panama's crisis worsened after Noriega, who controls the
civilian government, had the legislature depose President Eric
Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle tried to fire
the general as commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as president and
imposed the sanctions.

<HEAD>Man Accused in 16 Slayings to Be Tried Monday for Two of Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL SIMMONS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OZARK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused in 16 deaths, including the
Christmastime slaughter of 14 relatives, will go to trial first for
the two killings outside his family.
   R. Gene Simmons, 47, a retired Air Force master sergeant, is
charged with two counts of capital murder in the Dec. 28 shooting
spree in Russellville in which six people were shot by a gunman
wielding two .22 caliber pistols. Two of the victims died.
   In his trial, which begins Monday, Simmons could be sentenced to
die or to life in prison without parole if convicted of either
count of capital murder. He also will be tried on five counts of
attempted capital murder and one of kidnapping.
   The defense will ask Circuit Judge John Patterson to dismiss the
attempted capital murder counts on grounds that, under Arkansas
law, they are superseded by the capital murder counts, according to
defense attorney John Harris.
   Following the shooting spree, 14 members of Simmons family were
found slaughtered. Charges from the slaying of the family are to be
tried later.
   The 16 deaths made it one of the worst mass slayings in American
history.
   The case was moved to Ozark after the defense argued that there
had been so much pretrial publicity that it would be difficult to
get an unprejudiced jury in Russellville, 47 miles west of here.
   Harris declined to say whether Simmons would testify.
   The attorney said Sunday that he had no plans ``at this time''
to raise insanity as a defense. Tests on Simmons found no evidence
of a problem such as a brain tumor that could have affected his
behavior.
   After his arrest, Simmons was was found by doctors to be legally
sane and thus able to stand trial.
   Moments before he surrendered Dec. 28, police said, the gunman
told his hostage: ``I've gotten everybody who wanted to hurt me.
I've come to do what I wanted to do. It's all over now.''
   Simmons will be on trial for the deaths of Kathy C. Kendrick,
24, who police say once spurned Simmons' romantic advances, and of
James D. Chaffin, 33, who police say was a chance victim.
   Miss Kendrick was shot in the head at a Russellville law office
where she was a legal secretary. Chaffin was slain at an oil
company where the gunman wounded the oil company owner.
   To be tried later are two capital murder charges, one accusing
Simmons of killing seven relatives, the other accusing him of
killing seven other relatives. There are two groups of seven
because authorities believe the killings took place at different
times.
   After Simmons was arrested, sheriff's deputies found the bodies
of five relatives, including two of his children and their spouses.
Four of the victims had been shot and the other victim, Simmons'
11-year-old granddaughter, had been strangled. They apparently died
after they arrived for a Christmas season family gathering, police
said.
   The next day, police dug into a shallow, kerosene-soaked grave
and found seven bodies, including those of Simmons' other children
and his wife, Becky. She had told family members in a letter ``I am
a prisoner here, and the kids, too.''
   Police said that some of these victims had been shot, others
strangled, apparently before Christmas _ gift packages were
unopened beneath the Christmas tree.
   Police also found the bodies of two infant boys in garbage sacks
in the trunks of abandoned cars on Simmons property. They were
strangled.
   The gun that killed Miss Kendrick and Chaffin had been used to
kill some of Simmons' relatives, state ballistics experts said.

   Scientists from Battelle Memorial
Institute are developing a robot that will test clothing for the
Army by crawling, panting and even sweating.
   The life-sized robot, nicknamed Manny, is being made by Battelle
scientists in Richland, Wash., so the Army can see how protective
clothing worn by troops reacts to harsh conditions, such as heat,
cold, high humidity, smoke, fire and chemical attack. Development
costs have been about $2 million.
   Gregory Koller, spokesman for the Columbus-based institute, said
Manny is scheduled for delivery to the Army's Dugway Proving Ground
in Utah this fall.
   David W. Bennett, the Battelle engineer who developed the robot,
said Manny has 40 articulated joints that allow movement and stress
testing of the clothing. The robot can walk, bend over, squat, drop
to all fours and crawl.
   Robot testing gives more precise information on body and
clothing stress than is possible with humans, Bennett said.
   Manny's trials will be limited to the laboratory at Dugway,
because the robot is connected by an electronic cord to a computer.
   The robot's artificial skin will be sensitive to changes in
temperature or exposure to chemicals. During exertion, breath will
be simulated by expansion and contraction of the chest and the
exhalation of moist air.
   Perspiration is simulated by the release of water from small
tubes on the robot's body.
   The robot has to breathe and perspire to simulate the buildup of
moisture between the clothing and the skin.
   Since Manny exudes pure water, he has no body odor, said
Bennett. ``Actually, he smells pretty good so far,'' he said.

   Regan said he told Vice President George Bush about Mrs.
Reagan's dependence on astrological advice while they were
discussing the president's schedule just after the Tower Commission
report was issued in February 1987.
   He says Bush ``listened ... with surprise and consternation on
his face'' and exclaimed, ``Good God. I had no idea.''
   Regan portrayed Reagan as a reluctant decision-maker.
   ``He listened, encouraged, deferred,'' he wrote. ``But it was a
rare meeting in which he made a decision or issued orders.''
   ``Never did he issue a direct order, although I, at least,
sometimes devoutly wished that he would,'' Regan added. ``He
listened, acquiesced, played his role, and waited for the next act
to be written.''
   ``In the four years that I served as secretary of the Treasury,
I never saw President Reagan alone and never discussed economic
philosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscal
and monetary policy with him man to man.
   ``From first day to last at Treasury, I was flying by the seat
of my pants. The president never told me what he believed or what
he wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figure
these things out like any other American, by studying his speeches
and reading the newspapers.''
   While critical of the president's hands-off style, Regan also
commented that such a laid-back presidency created ``an atmosphere
of confidence and political dynamism.''
   Regan stressed, that in the president's mind, there was never a
swap of arms for hostages at the time the United States was sending
weapons to Tehran.
   Regan recalled that McFarlane first mentioned establishing ties
with Iran during a fateful July 18, 1985, meeting with Reagan
following his colon cancer surgery. The former chief of staff
contended that, contrary to McFarlane's testimony before the Tower
Commission, there was no mention of an arms-for-hostages deal.
   In fact, Regan called the meeting ``routine in memory,'' and
contended he might not even have remembered it ``if I hadn't had
such a difficult time persuading his (Reagan's) wife to let it take
place.''
   ``There is nothing in my notes or memory to suggest that the
idea of swapping arms for hostages was mentioned by either man on
this occasion. ... I am sure that any mention of such a scheme
would have made me prick up my ears,'' Regan wrote.
   The former chief of staff said he believes the president's
contention that he knew nothing of the diversion of funds to the
Contra rebels until told about it by Attorney General Edwin Meese
III on Nov. 25, 1986.
   ``The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. He
blanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from his
face, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw the
president's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment that
he knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him about
it. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable had
happened.''
   Regan blamed Reagan's former aides for the debacle that befell
the president and ultimately engulfed himself.
   ``Much of what happened was hidden from the president (and
incidentally from me) by McFarlane and his successor as national
security adviser, Adm. (John) Poindexter and by the remarkable
young Marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us, Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North,'' Regan wrote.
   ``As to the responsibility for the chaos that descended on the
White House, that appears to have been written in the stars,'' he
wrote.
   He said that he urged the president to counteract the effects of
the Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking schedule
outside Washington, but was balked by astrological advice to the
first lady that ``harm would come to Reagan if he went out of the
White House.''
   ``By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs.
Reagan.
   He says Reagan was first told the details of the proposed arms
sales to Iran by McFarlane, during the November 1985 Geneva summit
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Although he listened intently to McFarlane's words, the
president asked few questions,'' he wrote. ``He looked straight at
McFarlane, occasionally glancing at (Secretary of State George)
Shultz or me as if to study our reactions.'' He says Shultz
``commented very sparingly'' during the 20-minute meeting and the
president ended by ``once again saying yes by not saying no.''
   The former chief of staff indicated the meeting was typical of
Reagan's style.
   Regan related a stormy conversation between himself and the
president on the day he found himself suddenly replaced by Howard
H. Baker Jr. as chief of staff. Reagan failed to persuade him to
stay on and work with Baker during the transition.
   As Regan described it, he said, ``I'm sorry, Mr. President, but
I won't be in any more. This is my last day. I've been your
secretary of the Treasury for four years and your chief of staff
for two. You don't trust me enough even to tell me who my successor
is and make a smooth transfer. I deserved better treatment than
this. I'm through. I'm very disappointed.''
   Despite their difficult parting, he wrote, ``my admiration for
Reagan as president remains very great.''
   ``My judgment of him as a man, in light of my final experience
as his chief of staff, underwent a certain change, but this is
irrelevant,'' he said. ``Any man who had seen as much of the world
as I had seen when I came to Washington knew better than to put his
trust in princes.''

   A 9-year-old boy was arrested for allegedly
selling cocaine supplied to him by adults, police said.
   ``Lots of kids sell drugs,'' the unidentified boy reportedly
told officers after being taken into custody Saturday.
   ``For every five buyers, they (suppliers) give me $50,'' he said.
   Before he was led away, the youth pointed out his alleged
employers, police said. Hector Ramos, Dianilo Gonzalez and Juan
Rivera Ramos face charges of conspiring to violate drug laws, said
Jill Reilly, a police spokeswoman.
   Reilly said the boy was charged with possession of a Class B
substance and released to his mother. His name was not released
because of his age.
   Police went to the city's Dorchester section area Friday night
after receiving reports of a young boy who was selling drugs and
carrying a gun.
   The boy was spotted in front of an apartment building and turned
to flee when the officers approached, but he stopped in his tracks
when ordered to halt, Reilly said.
   ``I don't have a gun, just this package,'' the boy told officers
as he reached inside his pants pocket and brought out a package of
what he said was cocaine.
   Before being taken to the station, the boy pointed to three men
getting out of a car nearby and said: ``Those are the ones who gave
me the cocaine to sell.''

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Meets With Hungarian Leaders In Budapest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met with
Hungarian leaders in Budapest Sunday during the first visit by a
high-ranking Israeli official to the communist country, the Foreign
Ministry announced.
   Hungary, along with most other Eastern European nations, severed
ties with Israel after the 1967 Middle East war, but last year
Israel and Hungary established low-level diplomatic contacts.
   Peres met with Prime Minister Karoly Grosz and Foreign Minister
Peter Varkony, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Ehud Gol told The
Associated Press.
   Gol said Peres and the Hungarian officials discussed the
Arab-Israeli conflict and bilateral ties, including economic issues
and tourism. He did not elaborate.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry kept the visit secret until the
meetings were completed.
   Hungary's national news agency MTI issued no report on the
meeting and phone calls went unanswered at Israel's economic
interest section at the Swiss Embassy in Budapest.
   Peres flew from Israel to Zurich, Switzerland, on Sunday
morning, leaving 12 hours before his scheduled departure for Madrid
where he was to attend the Socialist International.
   During the Socialist International, Peres, head of the socialist
Labor Party, will meet with Soviet officials, including members of
the Communist Party's Central Committee, Gol said.
   Peres has told Israel television he might meet with Soviet
officials during his trip and he said he hoped to discuss a
possible renewal of ties with the Kremlin that were severed in 1967.
   Israel's relations with the Soviet bloc have been improving
steadily in the past few years.
   In September, Hungary became the second Eastern European country
after Poland to resume limited diplomatic ties with the Jewish
state.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias ended a
16-hour truce Sunday, fighting each other with tanks, mortars and
truck-mounted rocket launchers in battles that killed seven people
and wounded 25, police said.
   The toll from three days of fighting rose to 89 dead and 242
wounded following the breakdown of an Iranian- and Syrian-brokered
cease-fire.
   Police said hostilities broke out in south Beirut's densely
populated districts of Ghobeiri, Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi and
quickly spread to five adjacent neighborhoods.
   The fighting has included gunbattles inside a hospital, where a
doctor said militiamen forced surgeons to operate on dead comrades
``to bring them back to life.''
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri's pro-Syrian Amal militia and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, accused each other of
breaking the cease-fire.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for extremist factions
holding many of the 18 kidnapped foreigners in Lebanon, some of
whom are reportedly held in the embattled slums. It was not known
if the fighting had any effect on the captives.
   The fighting was touched off Friday by a pre-dawn ambush in
which four Amal militiamen were killed. Amal blamed Hezbollah.
   The thud of explosions and bursts of gunfire resounded across
the city Sunday. Both sides mounted grenade-throwing assaults on
each other's positions.
   Several apartment buildings were ablaze, but fire engines could
not enter the area because of the fighting.
   Both sides went on a kidnapping spree, abducting at least 20
civilians suspected of sympathizing with either side. Police had
said more than 100 other civilians have been abducted since the
outbreak of the slums war.
   An Amal communique charged Hezbollah gunmen were sniping at
residential neighborhoods from rooftops of apartment buildings in
the sprawling Shiyah district, and warned that this would spread
the fighting.
   Shiyah abuts Beirut's Green Line, which has sliced the capital
into Moslem and Christian sectors since the 1975 outbreak of
Lebanon's civil war.
   As the guns roared, Syria dispatched its military intelligence
chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, to west Beirut on an
apparent mission to reinstate the cease-fire.
   Kenaan went into conference with Berri at his sandbagged
residence in west Beirut's Barbour neighborhood, about five miles
from the fighting.
   State-run Radio Beirut said Kenaan also met acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Shiite Parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini.
   A coalition of the nation's senior Sunni and Shiite religious
leaders called on Syria to send troops into the slums.
   Syria deployed 7,500 troops in west Beirut on Feb. 22, 1987 to
curb the reign of feuding militias. The slums are outside the
jurisdiction of that contingent.
   The short-lived lull, which began about midnight Saturday,
allowed Red Cross and civil defense rescuers to evacuate scores of
trapped victims. Hospitals issued urgent appeals for blood
donations.
   An Iranian mission headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein
Sheikholeslam also was trying to negotiate a new truce, Radio
Beirut said.
   During the lull Sunday morning, the slums' estimated 250,000
inhabitants of the slums began venturing from their basements and
bomb shelters where they had been trapped for more than 50 hours.
   ``What have I done to deserve all this?'' asked Ali Shabshoul,
34, a grocer, whose shop in Bir el-Abed was reduced to a pile of
rubble by shellfire. His wife and two children stood crying beside
him.
   Nabil Alameh, while taking stock of the damage to his perfume
shop in an Amal-controlled neighborhood in Ghobeiri, asked: ``Who
is going to compensate me?''
   When told that ``Allah'' (God) would, he retorted icily, ``Allah
or his party?'' an apparent reference to Hezbollah.
   Many residents hurriedly packed up beds, mattresses and clothes,
and drove away from the slums. Others installed new doors on
damaged shops and houses.
   A doctor at al-Sahel hospital, which has received more than 100
casualties from both sides, said Hezbollah and Amal had clashed
inside the building.
   ``We have been forced many times to flee and abandon victims
because of frequent gunfights in the emergency ward,'' said the
doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   She said doctors also had been forced at by frenzied gunmen to
operate on dead comrades, ``telling us at gunpoint to bring them
back to life.''
   Police said Hezbollah appears to have made substantial
territorial gains in the fighting around the Ghobeiri district that
is home to the party's mentor, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
But each side held its ground elsewhere.
   During the lull in the fighting, Berri issued a statement
accusing Hezbollah of turning the slums into a ``a nest of terror
where kidnapped foreigners are held hostage.''
   ``You are a war criminal,'' retorted Hezbollah in a statement
released in west Beirut and addressed to Berri. ``Only spies of the
Great Satan (the United States) call us terrorists.''
   In a four-day confrontation last month, Amal crushed Hezbollah
throughout south Lebanon. Police said 62 people were killed and 150
wounded.

   A juror who ``was not coherent'' was
replaced with an alternate Sunday during a fifth day of
deliberations on whether Wayne Carl Coleman should die for the 1973
slayings of six members of one family.
   Judge Hugh Lawson excused the juror after a court deputy said
the woman was not capable of continuing in Coleman's murder retrial
for the Alday family deaths.
   The juror who was replaced appeared before the judge.
   Much of her testimony was inaudible. But she was heard to say
several times: ``They put a bug in my ear. Remember Mary Alday.''
   Mary Alday was the last of the six victims in the killing spree
in Seminole County on May 14, 1973. After five Alday men were shot
to death one by one at Jerry Alday's home, Mrs. Alday, Jerry's
wife, was taken to a nearby field where she was raped and killed.
   A deputy assigned to watch the sequestered jurors told the judge
that the juror ``was mumbling nonsense. She was not coherent. She
is not physically or mentally capable to continue.''
   The woman was the second juror to be replaced.
   Defense attorney Tom West moved again Sunday, as he has before,
for Lawson to declare the jury deadlocked. In such a case, Coleman,
whose original death sentence for the slayings was overturned on
appeal, automatically would be sentenced to life in prison. He has
served 15 years on his original conviction.
   Lawson again rejected the motion.
   The jurors convicted Coleman on six counts of murder last
Monday. On Wednesday, they began deliberating whether he should be
sentenced to death or to life in prison.
   Attorneys in the case believe a minority of the jurors are
holding out for a life sentence.
   Lawson has given no indication when he might halt deliberations;
on Saturday, he recharged the jurors and told them he wants them to
reach a decision. After the Sunday court session, the jury resumed
deliberations for a time before recessing for the day at
midafternoon.
   Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Elder Dungee were convicted of
murder and sentenced to death in 1974 for the May 14, 1973,
killings of Ned Alday, his brother Aubrey, Ned's sons Jimmy, Jerry
and Chester, and Jerry's wife, Mary.
   The convictions were overturned by a federal appeals court in
1985 because of pretrial publicity.
   Isaacs was convicted a second time in January and again
sentenced to death. Dungee is to be retried later in Columbus.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Getting Behind Philippines Aid Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is putting together
a $10 billion international aid program for the Philippines after
asking Congress for a decrease in direct U.S. assistance to the
financially troubled ally.
   The five-year plan, originally proposed by two Democratic and
two Republican members of Congress, would gather new money and
benefits for the Philippines from other nations, including Japan,
Australia and European countries.
   Officials have not indicated what the U.S. share would be.
   The proposal, patterned after the 1947 Marshall Plan to rescue
Western Europe after World War II, is being put together while U.S.
negotiators in Manila face demands for big increases in payments
for the use of key Air Force and Navy bases in the Philippines.
   Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus has said U.S.
``rent'' for the bases should be increased from the current $180
million a year to as much as $1.2 billion annually and should be in
addition to any other aid. Both congressional and administration
officials have said that kind of money likely would not be
available.
   Congress last year appropriated $347 million for the government
of President Corazon Aquino. The Reagan administration has asked
that that be cut to $257 million in the next fiscal year budget.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saturday the administration is moving toward announcement of the
international aid plan.
   The administration also plans to send a high-level special
emissary to the Philippines to dramatize its concern for conditions
in the country, The Washington Post reported on Sunday.
   The newspaper said a congressional delegation might accompany
the official, who would deliver a pledge of top-level support and
consult with Aquino on details of the program.
   The original proposal by Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Reps. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., called for at least $1 billion a year in new
international aid to Aquino's government and proposed that a
prominent American be appointed by the president to lead the
effort. The Post report said such an appointment was likely.
   The Philippines economy has been showing signs of increased
health since a popular uprising in February 1986 ended two decades
of authoritarian rule by Ferdinand E. Marcos and installed Mrs.
Aquino. But the government has had to use much of its income to
meet interest payments on its $26 billion foreign debt.
   The Post, citing unidentified sources, said the aid plan would
include debt relief in the form of reduced payments or debt-equity
swaps, trade preferences to encourage Philippine exports, and
private investments from international financial institutions and
businesses, in addition to direct aid.

<TEXT>
   Gunfire and streetfighting flared again
Sunday between ethnic Pakistanis and Indian immigrants in
Pakistan's largest city and at least 14 people were killed,
officials reported.
   The deaths brought the number of people slain in 10 days of
clashes to at least 30. A traffic accident in west Karachi April 29
led to riots in the eastern and northern sections of this city of 7
million people.
   Both groups compete for blue-collar jobs in a city with high
unemployment.
   Sunday's dead included at least four policemen killed when
militant Pathans, who trace their roots to northern Pakistan,
attacked police headquarters in three working-class neighborhoods,
according to the official APP news agency.
   It said the casualties included ``mohajirs'' _ Indian Moslems
who emigrated to Pakistan when India was partitioned in 1947 _ but
gave no figures.
   Karachi, a port city on the Indian Ocean, has had ethnic
violence for years. Several hundred people perished in riots in
late 1986.
   Traffic accidents and other minor incidents often erupt into
street battles.
   The troubled areas were reported calm Sunday night as army
troops moved in to impose an indefinite curfew.

   Seven teen-agers were injured early Sunday in
a drug turf battle when shots were fired into a street-corner group
of youth from a passing car, police said.
   Police Captain William White said an undetermined number of
youths were standing on the corner in southeast Washington when
occupants of the car opened fire.
   The shootings were in retaliation for an earlier incident
outside a nightclub in which at least one shot was fired but no one
was injured, White said.
   Five of the youths were taken to Southeast Community Hospital,
where three were treated and released and one was hospitalized in
fair condition and another in serious condition. Two others were
taken to Children's Hospital where they were treated and released.

<HEAD>Americans Tend To Vote For The Optimistic Candidate, Researchers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In nine of the past 10 presidential
elections, the candidate who avoided discussing problems and
offered an optimistic outlook was the winner, according to
researchers.
   They say those results are being borne out this year, because,
of the pack of presidential hopefuls who began the race, Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis and apparent Republican nominee George
Bush offered the rosiest messages.
   In analyzing nomination acceptance speeches of the two
major-party candidates since 1948, Martin Seligman and Harold
Zullow, psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, found the
candidate who avoided dwelling on national and personal problems
and characterized troubles with an optimistic outlook ended up in
the White House _ except in 1968.
   That year, Hubert Humphrey, whose message rated slightly more
upbeat than Richard Nixon's, came from behind in the polls to a
narrow defeat on Election Day, Zullow said.
   ``The danger is it tells a political candidate that if you shape
statements to what they want to hear _ you'll win. ... An
unscrupulous candidate can move further away from what he really
means,'' Seligman said.
   The correlation between the candidates' ratings in the analysis
and their actual margins of victory or defeat came almost as close
as is possible in social science, Seligman said.
   The researchers applied their theory to the 13 major candidates
running at the beginning of the year for the Democratic and
Republican nominations by analyzing texts of their speeches as
published in The New York Times in January and February.
   The results of the study are due for publication in The American
Psychologist, a psychology journal, later this year.
   The researchers counted the number of references to bad events
or problems, then had people who were unaware of the source of the
sentences rate them for pessimism and optimism.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis came in as the optimism winner,
followed by Rep. Richard Gephardt and Jesse Jackson. Bush was the
winner for the Republicans, with former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont
and Sen. Bob Dole behind him.
   Key to the high ratings for Bush and Dukakis, Zullow said, was
the low number of references to bad events. But also a major factor
in the equation was their tendency to view the problems
optimistically, citing forces outside the country or painting them
as temporary troubles that would be overcome by a vote in their
favor, he said.
   While Jackson's campaign has been punctuated by a theme of hope,
his speeches frequently have focused on the problems of American
society and politics, Zullow said.
   Dukakis tends to shy away more from discussing the country's
problems, he said.
   For instance, a passage from a Jackson speech about defense has
him firmly blaming the Reagan administration but using strong
language in describing perceived troubles, Zullow said.
   Jackson said: ``Reagan put out the deal that we are weak
militarily. That's not true. We're the strongest military in the
world.''
   But, he adds: ``Our boys got killed in Lebanon...Our boys are
vulnerable in the Persian Gulf, going up and down that river every
day being looked at down the gun barrel of American made guns sold
to the Ayatollah illegally. We've got a strong military and a weak
commander in chief.''
   Jackson loses points in the analysis by rekindling the trauma of
the 241 Marines and sailors killed by a car bomb in Beirut and the
current threat to the Navy in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush, like Dukakis, scored higher than the other party
candidates by not dwelling on a problem and quickly looking to an
optimistic future.
   ``Modern American voters seem to have a stable preference for
candidates who are more hopeful,'' Zullow said.

<HEAD>Wrangle Over Honorary Degree For Nelson Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting
Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South
African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections
from some faculty and students.
   Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring
Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to
change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who
could not be present at the ceremony.
   The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner.
   Law students last September began a campaign of demonstrations
and vigils on the campus. They hung a banner from the second floor
of the law library that said: ``Honor Nelson Mandela.''
   Before he was imprisoned, said third-year law student Sarah
Ottinger, ``Nelson Mandela was an ... attorney and an activist who
worked against apartheid. That's the message we wanted conveyed to
students.''
   South Africa's white-minority government says it will free
Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking
political power for blacks in the country.
   Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have
criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no
effort was made to include them.
   ``I don't even know what office is sponsoring it,'' said Keith
Motley, dean and director of the African-American Institute, a
student group. ``We got a memo from the administration saying they
need six ushers, but that's it.
   ``You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on.''
   ``This started out as something noble, something we've tried to
have done for three years,'' said Ottinger. ``We are very, very
sorry it happened this way. It wasn't meant to turn out like this.''
   The trustees decided in January that Mandela should get the
honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's
family to get their approval.
   University spokesman Paul Jones said letters were sent to
Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: Zenani, a student at
Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
   However, Northeastern still has not received approval from the
Mandela family, The Boston Globe reported.

<HEAD>Mayor's Approval Rating Drops, According to New York Newsday Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch's approval rating has
dropped sharply because of his controversial comments during the
recent New York primary, with his standing suffering most among
blacks, according to a poll released Sunday.
   The poll, conducted last week for New York Newsday by the Gallup
Organization, found 43 percent approved of Koch's performance as
mayor while 42 percent disapproved and 15 percent had no opinion.
   It was the first of five polls conducted for Newsday in the past
year that gave Koch an approval rating of less than 50 percent. The
previous poll in December 1987 gave him a favorable rating of 55
percent.
   Only 21 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Hispanics gave Koch
a favorable rating, down from 44 percent and 56 percent,
respectively, in December.
   Fifty-three percent of whites approved of the mayor, including
61 percent of Jews, down from 59 percent and 65 percent,
respectively, in December.
   During the campaign for last month's primary, Koch said Jews and
supporters of Israel ``would have to be crazy'' to vote for
Jackson, who has met in the past with leaders of the Palestine
Liberation Organization. He also said Jackson's proposed policies
would leave the country bankrupt and defenseless.
   Fifty-two percent of those polled said Koch's rhetoric
heightened racial tensions and 39 percent said they were less
likely to vote for him as a result.
   Regarding the 1989 mayoral race, 49 percent said Koch should not
seek re-election to a fourth term and 40 percent said he should. In
December, 45 percent said the mayor should seek re-election and 44
percent said he should not.
   Only 18 percent of blacks thought Koch should run for
re-election, down from 40 percent in December, while 40 percent of
Hispanics said he should run, down from 47 percent. Forty-nine
percent of whites said he should run, including 59 percent of Jews,
up from 47 percent and 56 percent, respectively, in December.
   The telephone poll surveyed 1,033 city residents and had a
margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

<HEAD>It's Off To The Horse Races After Voting In Two Texas Counties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texans have voted to authorize horse racing and
pari-mutuel betting in Dallas and Lubbock counties, and in one
small town's mayoral race a husband and wife ran against each other
and both lost to a write-in vote.
   In unofficial returns from all precincts, Dallas County voters
approved pari-mutuel betting 42,198 to 32,830, or 56 percent to 44
percent.
   Lubbock County voters approved pari-mutuel 18,939, or 52
percent, to 17,541, or 48 percent in complete returns.
   In Melvin, a West Texas town of 202 people, Florence and Nestor
Perez, both Republicans, faced each other on the ballot but were
defeated by write-in candidate J.T. Sparks, the incumbent
Democratic mayor.
   Sparks, who changed his mind about running after the filing
deadline, got 28 votes, Florence Perez got 27 and Nestor Perez got
7.
   The Lubbock racing vote was a reversal of last November's
election, when pari-mutuel won statewide despite a negative vote in
the West Texas county.
   A leader of the anti-gambling forces said more money and
stronger campaigning probably wouldn't have turned the tide.
   ``If we had been more visible it would just have increased the
turnout,'' said Sue Cox, executive director of Texans Who Care,
adding that greater numbers would probably work in favor of
pro-gambling efforts.
   Dallas voters also approved by more than a 2-to-1 margin a
proposal to build a new 12-story jail tower that would add 2,304
bunks to the county's jail capacity.
   Also Saturday, the city that doesn't want to be elected three
candidates who agree with that sentiment. Crystal Beach residents,
who voted in 1987 to disincorporate, elected three men who promised
to put the community of 1,045 back under the jurisdiction of
Galveston County.

   Jury selection for the murder trial of
a man who allegedly gunned down a judge and two others during a
divorce hearing will start Monday at the scene of the crime.
   Clyde M. Melvin faces three first-degree murder counts in the
July 28, 1987 shooting deaths at the Gulf County Courthouse.
Circuit Judge Wilson Lamar Bailey, 64, of Blountstown; Panama City
lawyer Tom Ingles, 43, who represented Melvin's ex-wife in divorce
proceedings; and Peggy White Paulk, 55, of Panama City Beach, his
ex-wife's sister, died.
   If convicted, Melvin could be sentenced to death or life in
prison without parole for at least 25 years.
   Melvin, 63, also is charged with attempted first-degree murder
in the shooting of his ex-wife, Eleanor Inez Huckeba, 59. She
suffered a gunshot wound to the head and has since recovered.
   The defendant, a former security guard, was wounded in the neck
by Gulf County Sheriff Al Harrison during the courthouse shootout.
   The selection of a 12-member jury is expected to take two days.
The crimes have received intense publicity, and court officials
have subpoenaed 450 prospective jurors in their effort to get an
impartial jury.
   The shootings began during a hearing on actions related to the
couple's Nov. 4, 1986, divorce, including a contempt motion against
Melvin for allegedly falling behind in his $350 monthly alimony
payments.
   Neither State Attorney Jim Appleman of Marianna nor Melvin's
court-appointed defense lawyer, Henry Barksdale, would talk about
the case.
   Circuit Judge Carl Harper, who spent most of his judicial career
in Palm Beach County, was called out of retirement to preside. He
has plenty of experience in handling highly publicized trials,
including the Roxanne Pulitzer divorce case and the murder trial of
Robert Spearman, who was convicted of hiring hit men advertised in
Soldier of Fortune magazine to kill his wife and committed suicide
in his prison cell last week.

   The best of the worst, the tops of the
lowest, the most awful assaults on the art of writing were honored
Sunday in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest.
   The top prize, the ``creme de la dreck,'' went to Rachel
Sheeley, 20, a journalism student at Franklin College in Indiana.
   ``I'd hate to say that bad writing comes naturally, but my
creative juices were flowing that day,'' Sheeley said in a
telephone interview Sunday. ``You have to get into a bad frame of
mind.''
   She said she is a would-be novelist, ``But I'm a pretty bad
procrastinator, so for now I want to go into newspaper writing and
have a deadline to write for.''
   Whether a boon or bane for her career, the prize came from San
Jose State University Professor Scott Rice, founder and ``grand
panjandrum'' of the literary disgrace he calls ``the Baltimore
Orioles of literature.''
   Despite the humor that surrounds its awarding, Rice stresses
that the competition is not a ``joke-writing contest. It really
takes a very good writer to deliberately write bad.''
   The contest trashes the battered memory of 19th century English
writer Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton. His turgid style is
captured in the opening line to one of his novels, later enshrined
by Snoopy, the erudite pooch in the comic strip Peanuts: ``It was a
dark and stormy night ...''
   Rice notes that Bulwer-Lytton also is remembered for such
ringing cliches as ``The pen is mightier than the sword'' and ``The
Great Unwashed.''
   This year's No-Ribbon Panel of Undistinguished Judges examined
more than 11,000 entries, searching for the most miserable, least
readable and rottenest lead sentence to the crummiest novel
imaginable.
   This awful thing submitted by Miss Sheeley brought her to the
top _ or the bottom _ of the heap:
   ``Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built,
Portia was sleek, shapely and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding
her body, which was as warm as the seatcovers in July, her hair as
dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like bright hubcaps, and her
lips dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood; she was a woman
driven _ fueled by a single accelerant _ and she needed a man, a
man who wouldn't shift from his views, a man to steer her along the
right road: a man like Alf Romeo.''
   Rice said the contest is a gentle reminder to the world of
letters that it is OK to lighten up, forget the grammar books for a
minute and have some fun, to ``approach the language recreationally
as well as practically.''
   For her effort, Sheeley wins a word processor.
   Awards were also made in selected categories.
   Brian W. Holmes of San Jose, Calif, won in puns: ``Once a month,
when the moon is full, Reverend Jim Bleaker and his lovely wife
Teddi invite members of the church to the parsonage for an evening
of hymn singing, followed by cookies, tea, and a frenzied orgy on
the lawn outside, making sure, of course, to take all the usual
precautions for safe sects.''
   Joan Mazulelwicz of Liverpool, N.Y., won for purple prose: ``The
silent snow fell relentlessly, unceasingly, mercilessly from the
sordid, sullied surreality of the sky as if some enormous, ethereal
diner were shaking grated parmesan on the great, soggy meatball
that was earth.''
   Michael Stratford, Miles City, Mont., won for science fiction:
``Shirley doubted that her alien escort, composed as he was of
vegetable matter, seaweed, and a thick coating of swampy muck,
would be a suitable date for the Intergalactic kegger, but he
turned out to be a real FUNGI.''
   R. B. Nelson, Nottinghamshire, England, won for detective novel:
``With the radio squawking that a 4711 was in progress at 37th and
127th, Murphy knocked car 495 into 3rd and headed up 5th at 70,
little reckoning, as he thumbed his .38, that this would be the day
when his number came up.''

<HEAD>Big Drop Predicted In U.S. Makers' Share of Auto Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. car companies will see their share of the
domestic auto market fall sharply in the next two years as Japanese
companies increase their production here, a study has concluded.
   The management consulting firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. of
New York predicted that domestic companies' share of the U.S. auto
market would fall to 56 percent in 1990 from 68 percent last year,
the Detroit News reported Sunday from Washington.
   Japan's auto makers should hold more than 30 percent of the U.S.
market by 1990, the newspaper quoted the study as forecasting.
   The firm's industry analysts estimated Japanese-based companies
would be building about 2.2 million cars a year in U.S. plants by
1990, the newspaper said. That equals the number of cars that the
Japanese export to the United States annually under current
voluntary restraints.
   Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Corp. and
Mazda Motor Corp. build cars in the United States and three more
Japanese companies plan to start production here by 1990.
   As a result of the competition, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. will see their share of the U.S. market
shrink, the study said.
   ``It's going to be more and more difficult to define what is a
U.S. company,'' the News quoted James Mateyka, a vice president of
Booz, Allen in Bethesda, Md., as saying.
   ``After Honda (North America Inc.) adds its engine and
transmission plants (in the United States) will it be less American
than Ford or GM?'' he asked. Honda has a final assembly plant in
Marysville, Ohio, and builds some engines in a former motorcycle
factory also in Ohio.
   The study also predicted that new Japanese auto plants will add
about 30,000 jobs by 1990, but not all will be unionized, the
newspaper reported.

<DATELINE>MELO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II visited Uruguay's
impoverished ``gaucho'' country Sunday and voiced strong support
for labor unions, but he warned against groups claiming to have all
the answers to workers' problems.
   The pope told a crowd of about 50,000 that he feels close ``in
word and heart'' to those involved in union activities, an apparent
reference to the labor unrest in his native Poland. On Saturday,
during his flight from Rome to Uruguay, John Paul expressed
approval of the Polish strikes.
   Cowboys on horseback, wearing flat-crowned black hats and
blankets draped over their shoulders, lined the route to the pope's
prayer service in a red-canopied altar erected in a large park.
   ``Those, who with zeal and sacrifice, seek to better the
conditions of workers deserve unconditioned support,'' said John
Paul.
   He said ``no ideology can claim to have a monopoly on solutions
to social problems.'' The church, he said, ``cannot allow any
ideology or political group to snatch from it the flag of justice.''
   This was a frequent theme on John Paul's eight earlier visits to
Latin America, especially in places where Marxists challenge the
established economic order.
   Although the pope didn't mention Poland in his Melo remarks,
Vatican officials said he was following the situation there
closely. An aide said John Paul had been informed that his words of
support Saturday were received with ``indescribable joy'' by
striking workers in Poland's Gdansk shipyard, according to reports
reaching Rome.
   As John Paul flew the 250 miles to Melo from Montevideo, his
Uruguayan Air Force jet passed over herds of grazing cattle. But
despite the cattle industry, Melo is one of Uruguay's poorest
areas. The town of 39,000 people near the Brazilian border has been
hit hard by unemployment.
   Referring to the distribution of wealth, John Paul said those
who own land and other property have an obligation to put their
wealth to the benefit of the entire community.
   ``Private property includes a social mortgage,'' he said.
   John Paul frequently cited the church's social teaching,
including an encyclical he wrote in 1981 on the problems of work.
The pope had cited that document as giving justification to the
strikes taking place in Poland.
   The pope visited Melo on the second day of a 12-day, four
country South American visit.
   At sunset, the pope led a Mass in a soccer stadium filled with
20,000 people in Florida, 68 miles north of Montevideo. He ordained
12 Uruguayan priests and one Argentine during the three-hour
ceremony.
   There was a brief incident when the pope left a cleared path to
touch hands with members of the crowd as he entered the stadium.
Security personnel surrounding the pope, who was seriously wounded
in a May 1981 assassination attempt in Rome, edged several people
out of the way until he returned to the path.
   The pope reminded the crowd, including many teen-agers, of
Uruguay's Christian origins and then told the newly ordained
priests ``your task is enormous. You'll be in the center of the
dialogue between God and mankind about salvation.''
   Several people were allowed on the stage to present the pope
with gifts including a tapestry and a fawn that the pontiff petted
on the head.
   ``Our people, as you know well, need more priests,'' the pope
said. Uruguay is considered the least religious country in South
America. Its president is a self-proclaimed agnostic, divorce has
been legal since 1907 and church and state have been separated for
61 years.
   In Montevideo, a Polish-Jewish survivor of a Nazi concentration
camp in World War II said Sunday that the pope embraced him with
``great emotion'' upon meeting him and hearing his story.
   Chil Rajman, 75, now an Uruguayan citizen, said that during a
brief meeting Saturday night between the pope and members of this
country's small Jewish community, he mentioned that he had been in
the German-run death camp in Treblinka, Poland.
   ``The pope grasped my hand with great emotion and said to me:
`You were in Treblinka and you survived,''' Rajman said.
   Pedro Sclofsky, the president of Uruguay's Central Jewish
Committee, said that during the meeting, at Montevideo's Catholic
University, ``the pope asked how many Jews there are here and if we
practice our faith freely.''
   Uruguay, with about 50,000 Jews among its 3 million inhabitants,
guarantees the freedom of all religions. Although most Uruguayans
are nominally Catholic, the country rigorously separates church and
government in all areas.
   The pope's itinerary included two days in Uruguay before flying
Monday to Bolivia for five days and then visiting Peru and Paraguay.
   John Paul returns to Rome on May 18, his 68th birthday. This is
his 37th foreign trip since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago.

   Joan Quigley, a San Francisco heiress who has
authored books on astrology, said Sunday she is the ``friend'' who
advised first lady Nancy Reagan on matters such as safe times for
the president to travel.
   ``I can't deny that she has consulted me,'' Ms. Quigley said in
a telephone interview from her Nob Hill home. ``I am very
uncomfortable, however, with the situation because normally I never
discuss the identity of my clients, and I never discuss their
affairs.''
   ``I am a serious, scientific astrologer and I am really not one
of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,''
said Ms. Quigley, who has been practicing astrology since 1960 and
has written three books on the subject.
   Ms. Quigley's revelation followed reports on the book, ``For the
Record; From Wall Street to Washington,'' in which Donald T. Regan
writes that ``virtually every major move and decision the Reagans
made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in
advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to
make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment for the
enterprise.''
   Regan confessed that he never learned the identity of the woman,
whom he said Mrs. Reagan referred to only as ``my friend in San
Francisco.''
   Time magazine, which published excerpts from the book, first
identified the woman.
   Ms. Quigley, who frequently appears on the Merv Griffin
television show, said she was first introduced to Mrs. Reagan by
Griffin.
   ``I really didn't get actively involved until the first
campaign'' for president by Reagan, she told The Associated Press.
She said she did astrological work for the campaign, but declined
to give details.
   ``After the assassination attempt, Mrs. Reagan asked me if she
could consult me because she was worried about the president's
safety, as well she might be,'' Ms. Quigley said.
   She said Mrs. Reagan telephoned her at ``various times,''
sometimes on Saturday afternoons from Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland, as Regan reported.
   ``I certainly never controlled the president's actions,'' she
said. ``Mrs. Reagan would want to know if something was a safe time
and I certainly advised her on that.''
   Ms. Quigley said her advice is based on the exact time and place
of a person's birth.
   In a separate interview with Time, she said, ``An astrologer
just picks the best possible time to do something that someone else
has already planned to do. It is like being in the ocean. You
should go with the waves, not against them.''

   An earthquake hit Japan's northernmost main island
of Hokkaido Monday morning. Police said they had no reports of
damage or casualties.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the quake registered 5.2
on the Richter scale and struck at 7:44 a.m. _ 6:44 p.m. Sunday
EDT. It said the quake was centered in Hokkaido's Hidaka mountain
range.
   Monday's tremor followed a strong earthquake that measured 6.4
on the Richter and rocked Hokkaido Saturday.
   In that quake, which was centered off the coast of the island,
local trains were temporarily halted while tracks were inspected
but there was no serious damage.
   There have been two major earthquakes in Hokkaido in the past 35
years. A quake in 1968 killed 52 people.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to
ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake
registering 5 can cause considerable damage and one of six is
capable of causing severe damage. A reading of 7 indicates a major
quake. Each increase of one number represents a tenfold increase in
magnitude.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson delivered a fresh attack on George Bush Sunday, saying the
vice president has ``started to panic.''
   Last week, Bush referred to Jackson as a ``hustler from
Chicago.'' Jackson has been excoriating the apparent Republican
nominee ever since.
   ``Now as we get closer, the opposition hears our footprints and
begins to panic,'' Jackson said. ``Vice President Bush has begun to
panic and has begun to call me names. ... He's panicking with
indecision. He's panicking with selective memory.''
   ``Why would anyone resort to name-calling?'' Jackson said. ``A
combination of constipation of the brain, deafness of ideas and
diarrhea of the mouth.''
   Bush made the ``hustler'' remark on Friday as he campaigned in
Lincoln, Neb. His campaign staff said there was ``nothing
derogatory'' intended in the remark. Spokesman Stephen Hart later
said it was meant as a comment on how hard Jackson has worked.
   Jackson was not mollified.
   ``He's trapped in an unholy triangle between the Ayatollah,
Noriega and Meese,'' he said of Bush, referring to Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Jackson's comments came as he was here delivering a graduation
address for his alma mater, North Carolina A&T State University.
Jackson graduated from the college in 1964.
   Campaigning later Sunday in West Virginia, which holds its
primary on Tuesday, Jackson reacted strongly to reports that Bush
had been briefed three years ago about drug trafficking by Noriega.
   ``The reason Mr. Bush has not led the charge to fight drugs is
because he knew of the administration's dealings with the drug
dealers,'' Jackson told reporters at Huntington's Tri-State
Airport. ``We must be leaders in an aggressive drive to stop drugs
in our country.''
   Everett Ellis Briggs, U.S. ambassador to Honduras, on Sunday
denied a report in Sunday's New York Times that said that while he
was ambassador to Panama he had briefed Bush in 1985 on evidence of
drug trafficking by Noriega.
   ``I could not have briefed the vice president on Noriega's drug
running, drug smuggling or money laundering activities because we
simply did not have evidence of those activities at that time,''
Briggs said at a news conference in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   Neither Bush nor Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis had any
campaign appearances on Sunday.
   ``Can I compete with Dukakis and Bush?'' Jackson said. ``That's
Harvard and Yale. They have the prestige, they have the power
structure, they have the press, they have the pundits ... and yet I
must not surrender. I've always battled the odds and won. I'm a
survivor.''
   A number of his family members were in the audience, including
his wife Jacqueline and his two sons, Jesse Jr. and Jonathan, both
of whom were awarded degrees during the ceremony.
   Jackson reflected on his years at North Carolina A&T and on the
years since his graduation, recalling his activism as a participant
in civil rights sit-ins to demand desegregation of public
facilities in Greensboro.
   He urged the 900 graduating students in the Greensboro Coliseum
not to allow difficult circumstances to stifle their dreams.
   ``As I get closer to the White House, there are no more
impossible dreams,'' he said.
   Jackson said his showing has been strong despite being
out-funded by his Democratic rival.
   ``I've come from further back with fewer resources, running
strong and don't feel no ways tired,'' he said.
   ``Now just don't say `Run, Jesse Run.' I run that you might run.
If I run for president, surely you can run for governor. If I run
for president, surely you can run for senator.''
   Jackson, sounding a familiar theme, said many young blacks might
see him campaigning on television and suspect that he cannot
understand their difficulties.
   ``I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me,'' he
said, invoking his early years. Jackson's mother was an unmarried
teen-ager when she gave birth to him.
   ``Born in three-room house, parents who didn't have health
insurance. I understand. Bathroom on the back porch, slop jar by
the bed. I understand.
   ``Had to hang out clothes on nails. I understand. Wallpaper used
for windbreaker, not for decoration. I understand. Had stand by an
open stove to get heat. I really do understand.
   ``Against those odds ... I never earned the right to do less
than my best and you do not have the right than to do less than
your best,'' he told the students.

   Americans celebrated Mother's Day with millions of phone calls
home, peace rallies in Minnesota and Nevada, free meals for the
needy in San Francisco and special treatment for mothers of
newborns.
   American Telephone & Telegraph predicted about 46 million calls
would be placed Sunday, topping the old mark of 44 million calls
placed Christmas Day 1987. Actual calling figures were not
available late Sunday.
   About 750 people participated in a Mother's Day protest at the
nation's nuclear testing grounds in Nevada, and 323 people,
including actor Martin Sheen, were arrested on trespassing charges,
authorities said.
   While many families shared Mother's Day privately, in San
Francisco, over 100 mothers from the impoverished Tenderloin
neighborhood dined at a Fisherman's Wharf restaurant while fathers
and other men from the community took care of their estimated 300
children.
   In Minneapolis, many of the 1,000 people at the Mother's Day
March for Peace and Justice used the eighth annual event to show
concern for the future of their children.
   ``We've got a world here to pass along to our children, and we'd
like to impress upon people that it would be nice to have a world
that's safe for children,'' Dr. Phyllis Goldin, chairwoman of the
Minneapolis chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, said
during Saturday's march.
   ``I think part of being a responsible parent is taking
responsibility for creating a world of peace and justice,'' said
Mary Benrud, a 26-year-old mother of three.
   A group with the same goals, the Women's Action for Nuclear
Disarmament, used a Mother's Day Ball gathering in Boston to honor
astronomer Carl Sagan and his wife, author Ann Druyan, for their
efforts to reverse the nuclear arms race.
   Hospitals got into the Mother's Day spirit in Connecticut and
Baltimore. Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven hired limousines to
take new mothers home, while babies at Mercy Medical Center in
Baltimore were ``gift-wrapped'' with flowers and pink or blue
ribbons before being brought to their mothers.
   A baby with a new heart was the gift for an Arizona woman whose
two other children died of heart ailments.
   The 6-month-old child, Anthony Lopez, was discharged Sunday from
Loma Linda University Medical Center in California, where he
underwent the five-hour surgery on April 19, said Anita Rockwell, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   The mother, Liza Lopez, 22, of Glendale, Ariz., called it ``the
best Mother's Day gift she ever had,'' Ms. Rockwell said.

<HEAD>Leading American Expert On Chinese Art Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurence Sickman, former director of the
Nelson Art Gallery in Kansas City and an internationally renowned
expert in Chinese art, has died at the age of 81.
   Sickman died Saturday at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City
after a lengthy illness.
   ``He was the dean of Chinese art in the Western world, and was
so recognized,'' said Marc F. Wilson, the Nelson Gallery's current
director. ``He was a universally admired and respected man.''
   His long career as a connoisseur and historian of Oriental art
was instrumental in making the Nelson Gallery's Oriental collection
internationally known, said Herman Sutherland, one of the museum's
trustees.
   Sickman graduated from Harvard University in 1930 and began
working as an agent for art purchases in China in 1931, two years
before the museum opened. In 1935 he became the Nelson's first
curator of Oriental art. He retired in 1977, but remained active as
director emeritus until he developed lung cancer two years ago,
Wilson said.

   President Francois Mitterrand was re-elected Sunday
to a second seven-year term in a resounding victory over
conservative Premier Jacques Chirac.
   The Socialist president pledged to fight the anguish, difficulty
and uncertainty facing many French people.
   ``You have chosen to accord me your confidence,'' said
Mitterrand, 71.
   ``There is too much anguish, too much difficulty and too much
uncertainty for too many in our society for us to forget that our
first duty is national solidarity,'' he said. ``Because the life of
humanity depends on it, I will act passionately in your name for
the development of poor nations, for disarmament and peace.''
   Chirac conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed.
Mitterrand supporters drove along the main Champs-Elysees Avenue
cheering and honking horns.
   ``In a democracy, the public is the master and I bow before its
choice,'' the premier said. ``I wish good luck to France and good
luck to the French.''
   Vote counting was suspended early Monday with 98.1 percent of
the ballots tabulated. Mitterrand had 53.91 percent and Chirac
46.09 percent. The turnout was 84.5 percent, less than the 85.9
percent in the 1981 presidential election. More than 38 million
people were eligle to vote.
   Chirac was expected to submit the resignation of his government
in the coming days. His center-right coalition continues to control
the National Assembly, but Mitterrand has said the new premier he
will name will try to work with the present Parliament. Failing
that, he will be forced to dissolve the Assembly and call new
elections.
   The state-run Antenne 2 TV network projected Mitterrand would
receive 53.9 percent of the vote _ the most since Georges Pompidou
won 58.2 percent in the 1969 runoff.
   In the first round of elections on April 24, Mitterrand won 34.1
percent of the vote to lead a field of nine candidates. Chirac was
second with 19.9 percent.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front
who won an astonishing 14.4 percent of the vote in the first round,
said in a bitter statement that the traditional right was ``the
stupidest right in the world.''
   He blamed Chirac for scorning the National Front and said that
was responsible for Mitterrand's victory.
   ``Today, France is back in the dead end it could have escaped,''
he said.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a centrist who
supported Chirac, said Mitterrand's re-election was a defeat for
the government's center-right policies.
   ``The president is going to name a new government,'' Giscard
said. ``We will judge it by its acts. One should not decide in
advance to vote against it. I will vote for the laws that I find
good and I will vote against the laws that I find bad.''
   The campaign ended on a dramatic note, with the Chirac
government winning the release of French hostages in Lebanon and
New Caledonia.
   Election day was not without its problems. In central Paris, a
group of masked men wielding steel bars charged into a right-wing
rally celebrating Joan of Arc day. Seven people were injured, five
seriously. No group claimed responsibility.
   In the tiny Alpine village of St. Eusebe-en-Champsaur, the local
PTA called for a boycott of the election to protest the planned
closure of the village school next fall. The school has only 12
pupils, but the PTA says there have been a large number of births
in the past three years that will increase future classes.
   Two weeks ago, only 16 of the village's 135 registered voters
cast their ballots in the first round.
   The election marked the first time in the 30-year history of the
Fifth Republic that an incumbent chief executive and his premier
faced one another for the presidency.
   Political debate throughout the long campaign focused largely on
generalities with few concrete proposals made by either candidate.
   During the last week of the campaign, three French hostages were
released in Lebanon and French gendarmes freed a group of hostages
taken by separatists in New Caledonia.
   Although Chirac said Saturday the incidents were not timed to
coincide with the election, the events became an important element
in the last hours of the campaign.
   Mitterrand has said he ``contributed'' to the release of the
hostages. ``There is no distinction between the government and me
in such a sensitive matter,'' he said.
   Mitterrand, who has moved markedly toward the center of the
political spectrum since he came to power in a Socialist landslide
seven years ago, issued a long ``Letter to all the French.''
   As opposed to 1981, when he campaigned on 110 specific
proposals, his 1988 platform was vague, built around a ``rallying''
of the French people for a ``united France'' and social justice.
   Most of his ideas are aimed at getting France ready for 1992,
when the European Economic Community drops all remaining trade
barriers and creates a true Common Market.
   Among his few specific proposals, Mitterrand said he will stop
the cycle of nationalization and privatization of French companies,
re-establish the wealth tax abolished by the right when it came to
power in the National Assembly in 1986 and create a minumum
guaranteed income. His top priority will emphasize training and
research as the key to fighting France's 10.4 percent unemployment.
   Chirac's platform, titled ``The Decade of Renewal,'' had three
basic themes: family, business and training. He pledged to continue
the policies begun in 1986 when the conservatives and centrists
ousted the Socialists from the National Assembly.
   The premier's platform, which also focuses on modernizing the
French economy before 1992, is short on figures, but calls for
continuing to reduce taxes on business and individuals, a
three-year budget deficit reduction program, further
denationalizations and an end to new immigration.
   Mitterrand's current term ends at midnight May 20.

<HEAD>Finger-Pointing Over Bank Lending Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports that many of Atlanta's banks restrict
home loans in black neighborhoods have generated strong protests
from political leaders despite bankers' denials.
   In a series of reports last week, The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution said a study showed that white neighborhoods
received five times as much money in home loans in 1986 as black
neighborhoods with the same income level. The newspapers suggested
that race helped determine lending patterns, an illegal practice
known as red-lining.
   ``I want to hear from some of our banking friends and people at
the savings and loans,'' said Atlanta City Council President Marvin
Arrington, who is black.
   Last week, the City Council formed a committee of bankers,
politicians and citizens to investigate lending practices and make
recommendations in 20 days.
   State banking commissioner Jack Dunn said Georgia needs a law
requiring banks to reinvest deposits in their communities.
   The Fulton County Commission unanimously approved a law
prohibiting discrimination in the sale, rental or finance of
housing.
   ``I feel that the banks really do owe not only affirmative
action in regard to this, but an apology to the city as a whole,
whether they've known about it or not,'' said commission Chairman
Michael Lomax, who is black. ``And I think they owe us an apology
for some of the characterizations they've made of the black
community.''
   The newspapers said federal statistics showed that loans to
Atlanta's middle-income black neighborhoods averaged $339.27 per
single-family home in 1986, compared with $2,432.82 in
middle-income white neighborhoods.
   The newspapers also said banks closed branches or restricted
business hours and gave lower property assessments in mostly black
neighborhoods. They said the banking practices hindered economic
development in the city's mostly black south side.
   Officials of several financial institutions that attended a
special City Council meeting last week denied that anything other
than economics determines their lending. They did not dispute the
newspapers' figures, though, and offered few suggestions for
boosting loans in black areas.
   ``It's called the First Rule of Banking,'' said James Wallace,
vice president of Fulton Federal Savings and Loan. ``Don't lend
money if you won't get it back.''
   ``Much of the housing in predominately black areas is
substandard, requiring rehabilitation to qualify for mortgage
lending,'' said Trust Company Bank spokesman Willis Johnson. ``As a
result, this cannot be handled through conventional mortgage
lending channels.''
   Ed Wood, executive vice president of Citizens Trust Bank, a
black-owned institution, disagreed.
   ``I have difficulty believing that most of the housing in black
neighborhoods is substandard,'' he said. ``That is where the black
community of Atlanta really got its name nationally. People who
come from outside are amazed: `Black folks got these kinds of
houses here?'''
   Citizens Trust, which lends mostly to blacks, had a lower
default rate on real estate loans than the six largest banks in
Atlanta, and the lowest of any bank its size in the nation in 1986,
according to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council, a government agency that reports for bank examiners.
   Some people suggested blacks should withdraw deposits from banks
that won't do business with them.
   ``If lending policies and practices do not change substantially
to meet the concerns and demands of the black consumer market, then
withdrawing funds from the recalcitrant banks and banks with poor
policies would be a logical step to take,'' said Earl Shinhoster,
Southeastern regional director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

   The U.S. dollar opened slightly lower against the
Japanese yen in early trading in Tokyo Monday while stock prices
showed a moderate advance.
   The dollar opened at 124.73 yen, down 0.15 yen from Friday's
close of 124.88.
   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said
there ``will be no major movements'' following a string of national

<TEXT>
   A tentative deal in which striking
shipworkers would get more pay but not press for reinstatement of
Solidarity took shape in talks revived at the urging of the
country's interior minister, strike leaders said.
   Czeslaw Kiszczak, who also is a ranking Communist Party
Politburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator to
revive the talks after they broke down late in the afternoon,
strike committee members said.
   The conversations between Kiszczak and lawyer Wladyslaw
Sila-Nowicki, a former member of the outlawed Solidarity trade
union who has since agreed to serve on Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski's consultative citizens' council, led to the resumption
Sunday night, they said.
   The talks resumed at 9 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT), three hours after
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and about 1,000 other workers defied
a management ultimatum to leave the shipyard or face prosecution.
   As a result of the talks, the strike committee wrote a letter to
management in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone its
long-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the following
conditions:
   _ Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers and
the people who have assisted them
   _ Promises of no disciplinary action against strikers, including
fines, dismissals or prosecutions. And formation of a joint
committee from members of the strike committee and the shipyard
workers' council to oversee implementation of the agreement.
   _ A wage increase of $38 on the average monthly wage of the last
three months, about $105.
   According to strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski and
other committee members, an agreement was near.
   The remaining sticking points were the creation of the joint
committee, objected to by management, and whether the rank and file
strikers were willing to give up demands for Solidarity, they said.
It was not known whether the two sides planned to push for an
agreement through the night, or try again Monday.
   The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1,000
reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reporters
there Sunday.
   Although a settlement appeared within reach, strikers inside
said they still feared a police action against the strike.
   Thousands of worshipers packed a church in this Baltic port city
in a show of support for the strikers.
   In Krakow, Poland's Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp
spoke out for the right of all people to participate in society's
decisions.
   All was quiet at the shipyard late Sunday after the deadline in
the management ultimum passed at 6 p.m. (noon EDT).
   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Walesa, said the negotiations Sunday
afternoon lasted only one hour and management's hard line stood in
sharp contrast to talks Saturday that the union considered ``a big
step forward.''
   ``The prosecutor and manager listed an ultimatum, saying all who
leave before six are safe and will not be prosecuted,'' Konopka
said, speaking to reporters at St. Brygida's Church near the
shipyard.
   The Lenin shipyard strike began Monday and came during a period
of labor upheaval that has been the worst in Poland since the 1981
military crackdown.
   The strikers have also demanded higher pay, anmesty for the
workers occupying the shipyard and the reinstatement of union
activists fired by the plant.
   Riot police blockaded the shipyard on Thursday and have not
allowed any food in since Friday.
   A predawn raid by riot police crushed a 10-day strike by
steelworkers in Nowa Huta in southern Poland on Thursday, and some
shipyard workers said they feared a similar action.
   Glemp said in his sermon that the church can ``point out the
road toward specific solutions. But it is necessary to remember
that every man has the right to participate in decisions
concernings the society in which he lives.''
   His sermon followed a statement Saturday by Polish-born Pope
John Paul II that strikes can be justified and Poland lacked ``true
democracy.''
   About 5,000 strike supporters crammed inside St. Brygida's
Church to pray for those in the Lenin shipyard, the 1980 birthplace
of Solidarity. About 2,000 more flooded the streets nearby and
thousands of police stood guard around the church.
   ``Disgrace Disgrace'' the crowd chanted when the Rev. Henryk
Jankowski, Walesa's friend and adviser, delivered his sermon.
   ``Why should we support the striking workers?'' Jankowski asked
the crowd rhetorically. ``Because they are fighting for our rights.
... The shipyard is the symbol of all of Poland.''
   His speech was interrupted with chants of ``Lech Walesa! Lech
Walesa!'' and ``There is no freedom without Solidarity!''
   On Saturday night Walesa told the strikers that if a raid came,
``I'll be the last to leave the shipyard.''
   The shipyard strike was the latest of five strikes in Poland.
   In each case, workers have pressed for higher wages to
counteract inflation which reached 42 percent in the first three
months of 1988.
   The government has said the strikes could derail Poland's
attempts to reform its ailing economy by raising prices, reducing
goverment subsidies, introducing competition and encouraging
private and managerial enterprise.
   One of Jaruzelski's closest advisers, Lt. Col. Wieslaw Gornicki,
said Sunday that the strikes were a normal outgrowth of ``making
our economy more efficient.
   ``This always, and everywhere, brings about some tribulations,''
he said, interviewed from Poland on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''

   More than 1,000 supporters gathered at the
hillside estate of Ferdinand Marcos on Sunday for a three-hour
memorial service for the exiled Philippines president's mother.
   ``A Philippines that is free, democratic and strong, that is the
legacy of my mother,'' Marcos said in the eulogy.
   ``I shall not see her dead. I shall see her alive. She will be
with me every day of my life,'' said Marcos, who was denied
permission to return to the Philippines for the funeral of Josefa
Edralin-Marcos, who died there Wednesday.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino, in a radio broadcast in
Manila on Sunday, reiterated that she decided against allowing
Marcos to return for security reasons.
   The Roman Catholic service here, which included recitation of
the burial rites, was held on the lawn of the Marcos home. A small
white tent was erected for the Marcos family and their close
friends.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, and the couple's daughter, Irene, both
sang, and several leaders of Marcos support groups spoke.
   Following the service the supporters who were transported to the
estate on tour buses were fed McDonald's hamburgers, spaghetti and
traditional Filipino foods.
   Marcos and his family have lived here since fleeing Manila in
February 1986 during a largely non-violent uprising that brought
Mrs. Aquino to power.

<TEXT>
   Rodrigo Borja won Sunday's presidential
election in the runoff race between two leftists to succeed
pro-American President Leon Febres Cordero.
   ``Thank you, Ecuador, thank you,'' Borja said on television in
the capital. ``We will have a government by the people and for the
people.''
   Thousands of Borja's supporters in Quito, his highland
stronghold, swarmed into the streets to celebrate and caravans of
cars with their horns blaring packed the city's avenues.
   Borja's rival, Abdala Bucaram, conceded defeat in an address
over national television from his power base in Guayaquil.
   ``There are no excuses. Dr. Rodrigo Borja is the president of
Ecuador,'' Bucaram said.
   With the count nearly complete, Borja had 1,584,483 of the valid
votes and Bucaram 1,344,200.
   Political analysts had said the election was too close to call.
Public opinion polls showed 25 percent of the country's 4.7 million
eligible voters still undecided in the final weeks of the campaign.
Election oficials had estimated the voter turnout would be about 80
percent.
   Borja and Bucaram had conducted a bitter campaign marked by
exchanges of insults in their race to replace Febres Cordero, a
conservative who has promoted free-market policies and befriended
the United States.
   Febres Cordero voted in Guayaquil and discounted persistent
rumors of a military coup if Bucaram is elected. Coups ``are out of
fashion,'' he said.
   Bucaram has charged that the right spread the rumors to try to
prevent him from winning.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The election pitted Borja, a 52-year-old law professor and
leader of the Democratic Left Party, against Bucaram, a
tough-talking 36-year-old populist who vowed to ``punish the
oligarchy.''
   Sirens and church bells echoed Sunday through the streets of
this city 9,300 feet high in the Andes, signaling opening of polls.
   Voters included colorfully dressed Highland Indians from the
outskirts of the capital. Indians make up 35 percent of Ecuador's
population of 10 million.
   Campaign violence intensified in the final weeks before the
election, leaving three people dead and more than a dozen wounded.
Newspapers and Roman Catholic Church leaders blamed the clashes on
the vitriolic rhetoric of the candidates.
   Bucaram, leader of the Roldosista Party, called his adversary a
drunkard, a drug addict and an atheist, a potentially damaging
accusation in this heavily Catholic nation. He also used coarse
street language to question Borja's manliness.
   Borja, an urbane, usually reserved politician from Quito,
responded with insults of his own, calling Bucaram a ``fascist
ignoramus.''
   Borja and Bucaram qualified for the runoff by leading a field of
10 candidates in the first round of voting Jan. 31. Borja won 20
percent of the vote, and Bucaram took 15.
   Febres Cordero, of the Social Christian Party, came in third, a
sign of his government's low popularity.
   Borja, who lost a close runoff to the president in 1984 and was
making his third bid for the presidency, pledged to reverse the
government's free-market economic policies and seek close ties to
the non-aligned movement.
   Bucaram is political boss of the huge slums that sprawl over the
outskirts of Guayaquil, the country's largest city and its major
port.
   His opponents accused him of making demagogic appeals to the
poor, including promises to give free shoes to all poor children
and nearly double the monthly minimum wage to $55.
   His followers affectionally call him ``the crazy one'' because
of his fiery speaking style. During the campaign, he recorded a
song titled ``That's Why They Call Me Crazy.''
   This small nation returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years
of civilian and military dictatorships.
   Febres Cordero, whose four-year term ends in August, has had a
stormy relationship with leftist and populist parties that
controlled Congress. He also put down a rebellion by an air force
commander halfway through his presidency.
   His successor faces the most serious national economic crisis
since Ecuador began exporting oil in the early 1970s.
   The economy shrank in 1987 by 3.5 percent, and inflation is
expected to climb to at least 50 percent this year, the highest
level since 1983.
   Febres Cordero's supporters blame the problems on a sharp drop
in the price of oil, Ecuador's main source of income, and economic
damage from a devastating earthquake in March 1987.

   A smoky fire broke out during a Mother's
Day cruise Sunday on the Belle of Louisville steamboat, and at
least 13 people suffered minor injuries.
   The fire, of undetermined origin, scorched a wall on the second
level of the steamboat's starboard side.
   ``We couldn't get downstairs at first because of the smoke,''
said Mattie Swope, who was on the Ohio River cruise with her mother.
   Kevin Mullen, the Belle's alternate captain, steered the boat to
shore at a park east of downtown, where fishermen helped moor it to
trees, crew members put out the fire and volunteer firefighters
helped evacuate about 570 passengers, said Harrods Creek Fire Chief
Leonard Heydt.
   Firefighters knocked out a large section of the boat's outer
paneling. There was no damage estimate Sunday, said Mike
Fitzgerald, the Belle's captain, who was not on board at the time
of the fire. He said the boat would not carry passengers again
until after a Coast Guard inspection.
   A woman with asthma was hospitalized for smoke inhalation, four
others were treated at hospitals for smoke inhalation and bumps and
bruises, and the rest were treated at the scene, officials said.

   A strong earthquake shook western Luzon island
in the Philippines before dawn Monday, the Royal Observatory of
Hong Kong reported.
   The quake at 3:47 a.m. (3:47 p.m. EDT Sunday) was centered about
112 north-northwest of Manila and had an estimated magnitude of 5.4
on the Richter scale, the observatory reported.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in a
populated area while a quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale can
cause severe damage.
   The Richter scale gauges energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one number means ground motion is 10 times greater.

   Strong thunderstorms moved across parts of the Mississippi
Valley and the Plains and Midwest on Sunday, spawning tornadoes in
Iowa and Illinois and dropping hailstones up to 2{ inches in
diameter.
   Tornado watches covering the afternoon and early evening were
issued for parts of Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Some injuries were reported as a tornado touched down at Elwood,
Ill., just south of Joliet, Sunday night, tearing the roof off a
condominium and strewing debris, the National Weather Service said.
Several other tornadoes touched down in Illinois, and aircraft were
overturned at the Rockford, Ill., airport as winds gusted to 81 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were accompanied by heavy rain and
hail from southwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota through
central and southwestern Iowa, western Missouri and eastern Kansas
into eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   More than two dozen tornadoes swept through southeast Iowa,
damaging several homes near Ottumwa and tipping over mobile homes
in Libertyville. High winds also blew tree limbs through power
lines, causing scattered power outages around Des Moines. No
serious injuries were reported.
   High winds in Talbot, Ind., about five miles east of the
Illinois border, moved and damaged a storage shed, authorities.
Several unconfirmed tornadoes were reported in southern and central
Wisconsin, where storms damaged roofs and knocked down trees and
power lines. No injuries were reported in either state.
   Late Saturday, a tornado struck a mobile home southwest of
Omaha, Neb., and killed two people.
   Hail up to 2{ inches in diameter fell just west of Lawrence,
Kan., during the morning.
   Hail as big as golfballs pelted the Iowa towns of Anamosa and
Afton, and the areas of Carlise and Indianola, southeast of Des
Moines, and parts of Kansas and Missouri.
   Wind gusts of 50 mph were clocked while the storms crossed
central Iowa and tree limbs were reported blown down at
Marshalltown. Waterloo had gusts to 58 mph and three-quarter-inch
hail, and Dubuque recorded gusts of 67 mph.
   Hail up to an inch and a half in diameter fell in Missouri's
Nodaway County, about 50 miles north of Kansas City.
   To the south, showers and thunderstorms moved into northern
Louisiana and southern Arkansas, with one-inch hail reported at
Canton, Ark. Lightning set a house afire at Lone Star, Texas, the
weather service said.
   Showers were scattered ahead of the main area of thunderstorms,
extending from southern Illinois through western Kentucky and
western Tennessee into northern Alabama. Behind the front, showers
were scattered from central South Dakota into the Nebraska
Panahndle.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered from southwestern Oregon into
the northern valleys of California.
   Muskegon, Mich., warmed to a record 83 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 35
degrees at Rock Springs, Wyo., to 97 at Laredo, Texas. The low for
the day was 22 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Great Lakes region through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys
into the lower Mississippi Valley and central Gulf Coast.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted in southwestern Wyoming; in the
80s from the desert Southwest to the southern Plains, the lower
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys and the Southeast into Florida;
in the 90s over the Arizona deserts, and south-central Texas and
the Rio Grande Valley; and in the 60s or 70s across much of the

   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis' private
plane landed at a U.S. air base on Sunday after Panamanian security
agents harassed his own security detail waiting for him at a
commercial airport, a U.S. Embassy official said.
   Davis was returning with family members from Contadora Island
off the Pacific coast of Panama when the plane landed at Paitilla
Airport in the capital, said embassy spokesman Terrence Kneebone.
   As the small jet landed, Davis saw several Panamanian security
agents armed with rifles ``harassing'' the ambassador's security
detail, Kneebone said.
   Davis then decided to have the plane take off and land instead
at Howard Air Base, five miles to the northwest in the canal zone.
   One of the Panamanian security agents at Paitilla Airport was
demanding to know who was on the plane with Davis, said Kneebone.
   The U.S. security officials were in contact with the plane by
radio as it came in to land, the Kneebone said, and spoke with
Davis once on the ground. It was then decided in the face of
``fairly hostile actions'' on the part of the Panamanian agents to
fly the plane elsewhere, he added.
   The plane then radioed for and received takeoff clearance from
the airport tower before flying on to Howard.
   ``The ambassador never got out of his plane,'' he said.
   Davis' daughter and other family members were aboard the
aircraft.
   The U.S. security detail left Paitilla after Davis' plane took
off, the official said.
   There was no immediate comment from Panamanian governent
officials.
   Paitilla Airport services small private and commercial aircraft.
   It was the second incident in which Panamanian security agents
apparently sought to interfere with the ambassador's movements in
Panama. On April 3, a military vehicle tried to stop Davis'
chauffer-driven limousine as he was leaving the residence of the
Vatican ambassador.
   The vehicle followed Davis' limousine and tried to stop it with
lights and sirens, U.S. Embassy officials said at the time. Davis
continued on to his own residence in what the Embassy called a
``serious'' incident.
   The Panamanian government said the episode involving the
ambassador's limousine was ``strictly a police matter'' caused when
a police sergeant saw ``an exaggerated display of automatic arms
carried by civilians in three vehicles'' that followed Davis'
vehicle.
   Sunday's incident at Paitilla Airport was certain to further
strain relations between the United States and the Panama
government dominated by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of
the Defense Forces.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges and has rejected U.S. demands that he resign.

   A new Minnesota law that will ban plastic
foam packaging made with ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons isn't
creating much of a stir in the packaging industry, but the law's
backers say its symbolic impact is substantial.
   By enacting restrictions against foam packaging produced with
the compound, known as CFCs, the state has created a vehicle for
possible future restrictions on other products made with CFCs,
lawmakers and industry watchers say.
   ``It will send a very strong message to industries who use CFCs
that they have to clean up their act,'' said Sen. Greg Dahl, who
helped shepherd the law through the legislature.
   CFC-produced foam containers used for packaging fast food and
other products may not be sold or made in the state beginning in
1990.
   The plastic foam packaging industry isn't worried, partly
because it does not have a manufacturing presence in Minnesota.
Furthermore, manufacturers already have agreed to use a substitute
chemical compound that is less damaging to the ozone layer than are
CFCs.
   ``I don't foresee it as a problem for anyone in the industry,''
said Jim Lammers, a spokesman for Dart Container Corp. of Mason,
Mich., the nation's leading producer of foam cups and containers.
   But even though the Minnesota law is regarded as a marshmallow,
its chief authors and environmental experts say it its symbolic
effect and future implications are important.
   ``It's like the seat belt law with no fine,'' said Rep. Steve
Trimble, who along with Dahl herded the bill through the
legislature. ``It's a warning to people.''
   The CFC packaging ban breezed through the Minnesota legislature
this year and was signed by Gov. Rudy Perpich. Trimble said Maine
was the only other state with a similar law.
   Gaseous CFCs are used to expand polystyrene beads into the foamy
plastic containers that some fast-food chains are using to package
hamburgers. Egg cartons, cups, and cafeteria trays also commonly
use the product, Lammers said.
   The chemical compound escapes to the atmosphere during
production, slowly rising 15 to 25 miles to deplete the ozone layer
that protects the Earth from the Sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays. Some CFCs are trapped in the foam products and released later.
   The Foodservice & Packaging Institute stated last month that the
industry would be operating with a less-damaging substitute
chemical by 1989.
   The substitute, known as HCFC-22, was approved last December by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and three major
environmental groups support its use until a completely safe
substitute is found. HCFC-22 still has some potential for damaging
the ozone layer, but the Environmental Protection Agency estimates
it is only about 5 percent as powerful as CFCs.
   CFC use in making food packaging foams account for only 1.5
percent to 2 percent of the United States' total CFC use.
   But Dean Abrahamson, a professor of public affairs at the
Humphrey Institute, said the Minnesota law would have an impact
because ``it's an indication of the state's concern.''
   He said the CFC law on the books could be strengthened later to
cover other sources of CFCs, which also are used in refrigeration
units and construction materials.
   ``Next year I'm sure we'll come back and look at this issue some
more,'' Trimble said.
   Dahl said he would like to pass legislation next year requiring
warning labels on other products that contain or are manufactured
with CFCs.
   Under the new law, state and local governments will be banned
beginning January 1 from purchasing, manufacturing, selling or
distributing packaging known to be CFC-processed. The ban will be
extended to cover all citizens beginning Jan. 1, 1990. Violators
could be fined up to $500.
   The law passed by the 1988 Legislature also appropriates $25,000
to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to study ways to
eliminate other CFC sources in the state.

<HEAD>Action Heats Up in GM Stock</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This is for Monday PMs.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The action has been unusually lively of late for
the 900,000-plus investors who own shares of General Motors Corp.
   In the stock market debacle last fall, GM shares lost some 47
percent of their value, plummeting from a high of 94 to a low of
50. In the few months since then, they have recovered more than
half that loss, rallying past 75.
   Of course, many stocks have experienced wide swings in the past
year. But the behavior of GM has been noteworthy for several
reasons.
   Given its standing as the nation's second most widely owned
stock, outranked only by American Telephone & Telegraph, the ups
and downs of GM's price have had a far-reaching impact on the
finances and emotions of the investing public.
   What's more, GM has long been regarded as a quintessential blue
chip, a relatively stable investment supported by a generous
dividend yield (6.6 percent as of late last week).
   Through the mid-1980s, it lived up to that billing. From early
1983 through early 1987, GM swung back and forth in a range roughly
between 60 and 85.
   It was only when the long bull market reached its climax last
year that the stock jumped to a new high and subsequently toppled
to a five-year low.
   Certainly, some of that increased volatility can be attributed
to the flighty environment for stocks in general. GM holds a
prominent place in the market indexes used by professionals in
computer-program trading.
   But as any casual reader of the business news would readily
conclude, there has been more to the story than that.
   As a giant enterprise plagued by mounting competition from both
foreign automakers and its domestic counterparts, the company has
come under increased criticism in recent years about its management
decisions and ways of doing business.
   The negative reviews perhaps reached a crescendo in
mid-February, when Fortune magazine described 1988 as ``the
make-or-break year for the world's biggest company'' and carried a
cover story in which erstwhile board member Ross Perot described
``How I would turn around GM.''
   At the same time, however, many Wall Street analysts who follow
the auto industry were taking a different view _ that the company
was beginning to sort out its problems, cut its costs and improve
its earnings prospects.
   Chuck Brady, an analyst at the investment firm of Oppenheimer &
Co., declares, ``The turnaround at GM continues.
   ``On the product side, momentum has shifted. GM's products, both
cars and trucks, are selling better than last year.
   ``Internal audits show that quality is up significantly and, by
most accounts, style in design is improving too. We continue to
believe GM represents an excellent investment opportunity.''
   Not all the company's followers on the Street are quite so
sanguine. Said Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities International in
a recent report:
   ``The major problem, as we see it, is not the company's
short-term potential of profitability, but whether GM is capable of
building and selling cars that will be competitive with the next
generation of Japanese and European vehicles.
   ``The company is still extremely vulnerable to negative news,
and hence our reluctance to jump on the GM bandwagon.''
   Wherever it is headed in the future, the recent strength in the
price of the stock is heartening to followers of the ``GM
bellwether'' as an indicator of the overall market outlook.
   Robert Stovall, president of the money-management firm
Stovall-Twenty-First Advisers, says this indicator has been bullish
since GM shares went four months without matching or going below
their Oct. 19 low of 50.
   Stovall concedes the patterns in GM's stock chart aren't an
infallible guide to the market outlook. The ``bellwether'' got
caught in the midst of the flock in the crash last fall.
   Nevertheless, he says, ``it is now heralding a summer rally.''

   Mike Halstead mopped his face with a
towel as he walked away from an exhausting session that had nothing
to do with making cars at the local Mazda Motor Corp. plant.
   Halstead headed for the shower while other Mazda employees
continued grunting through repetitions on weight machines, pedaled
away on manual exercise bikes and worked on balance and agility on
a simulated cross-country ski unit in one corner of the Flat Rock
plant's fitness center.
   ``Job One'' _ the first Mazda car made at Flat Rock _ rolled off
the assembly line in September. In November, the company opened the
$1 million fitness center in a 90,000-square-foot section of one of
the plant buildings.
   Fitness programs, once the reserve of management, are moving
from the front office to the plant floor at many companies, said
Thomas Merry, Midwest region vice president for Fitness Systems.
``That's where we see the direction of this thing going.''
   ``It's been an administrative headquarters, white-collar kind of
phenomenon,'' said Merry, whose Los Angeles-based company designs,
sets up and operates fitness programs. Now, he said, ``We do see
more plant sites getting involved.''
   Reasons range from simple economics _ an unhealthy worker costs
more to keep on the job _ to companies' desire to be involved with
employees as a way of keeping them involved in their work.
   At Flat Rock, the matter was never in question, said Don R.
Kricho, personnel safety and health director.
   Japanese corporations routinely provide extras for improving the
health and lifestyle of their employees. Single workers may even
live in company dormitories there.
   ``It was always pretty much taken for granted that we were going
to do something in terms of a fitness center,'' Kricho said. ``In
Japan, it's something they do.''
   A study conducted last year on the StayWell program Control Data
Corp. of Minneapolis implemented for its employees linked higher
health insurance claims with various risk factors, including lack
of exercise, smoking, excess weight and high cholesterol.
   For example, sedentary employees have 30 percent more hospital
days than those who get adequate exercise and employees who smoke a
pack or more of cigarettes a day have 18 percent higher medical
claims costs than nonsmokers.
   ``There are some very solid, practical business reasons for
wanting to do this,'' Mazda's Kricho said. ``Fit, happy workers
produce more. They are less likely to be absent, they are less
likely to be injured.''
   Before and after work at Flat Rock, as early as 5:30 a.m. and as
late as 9 p.m., the sounds of weight machines, dribbling
basketballs and squeaking sneakers, footfalls on the one-fifth mile
track, volleys on the tennis courts, golf balls driven into a net,
ping-pong games, and players' shouts echo under the high plant
ceiling.
   ``Some nights I call over here and it's so loud you can't even
talk on the phone,'' said Cynthia T. Nemon, plant medical services
coordinator and fitness center director.
   Domestic companies get the message. General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co. plants offer a scattering of exercise rooms and
aerobics classes. Chrysler Corp. is surveying some assembly plant
workers to see if they want aerobics classes.
   Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich., offers a ``healthy
lifestyle'' program for employees that includes newsletters and
reimbursement for participation in fitness activities, said Dick
Lovell, company communications manager.
   Kellogg opened a fitness center at its corporate headquarters in
1986 and followed in January with a center at its Battle Creek
cereal plant, where the exercise bikes, rowing machines,
weight-lifting equipment, jogging track and aerobics room are in
such demand among the 3,200 employees that hours have been extended
to midnight, Lovell said.
   At Flat Rock, Mazda's center is part of an involvement with
employees similar to that in its Japanese plants.
   The number of Japanese employees at Flat Rock _ 600 of the
plant's 3,500 _ eventually will fall to about 100. But the company
wants U.S. employees to be instilled with Japanese-style team
spirit.
   ``We were not so much interested in building a recreation center
for employees. It's great if they want to use it for that. But we
wanted to emphasize the team concept,'' Kricho said. ``We were
interested in building a facility that would cater to team
activity.''
   Team activity caught on immediately. Nemon said intensely
involved employees formed committees for baseball, volleyball,
weight training, running, martial arts, aerobics and golf.
   ``All the committees have established classes and leagues,'' she
said. ``The employees themselves completely run those activities.
They have 20 different teams in the basketball league.''
   ``I worked at Jeep before. They never had anything like this,''
said Halstead, just out of training as an assembly worker at Mazda.
   He compared the center favorably with outside programs,
explaining that he and his wife had spent $400 at the Y, which
didn't have a place to run.
   ``I can't wait till they get that heavy bag up,'' he said.
   Kricho said he envisions annual physicals for employees, with
prescriptions for good health habits _ quitting smoking, weight
control, cholesterol reduction and hypertension control.
   Center activities already go far beyond traditional gymnasium
fare, Nemon said, including a diet support group and available
literature on subjects ranging from smoking to personal
relationships.
   Kricho said Japanese companies view corporate responsibility as
going beyond a paycheck.
   And he said, ``If we are responsible for human beings _
spiritual and mental well being and everything else _ a fitness
center becomes a very central ingredient, a focal point.''

<HEAD>Brewers Look to Light Beers for Growth</HEAD>

   These are heady days for light beer.
   While overall growth in the beer business has flattened out,
light beer sales remain effervescent. They have nearly doubled in
the past seven years and now account for more than 24 percent of
the overall beer market.
   The major brewers are encouraging the growth by spending nearly
$220 million a year on advertising light beers, about a third of
their total ad budgets, according to Leading National Advertisers,
which tracks such spending.
   In the latest indication of the importance brewers attach to the
segment, Miller Brewing Co. recently began testing a light version
of its Genuine Draft beer, which has been on the market for about
two years.
   Industry executives and analysts say the nation's weight- and
health-consciousness continues to propel the segment's growth.
   ``You can drink the same amount of beer and take in less
calories. What more can one ask out of life?'' said Emanuel
Goldman, who follows the beer industry for Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco.
   The light beers typically have a third fewer calories than the
140-150 calories in regular beers and slightly less alcohol.
   Beverage industry analysts say another important ingredient in
the success of light beers has been the ability of brewers to make
and market a drink that traditional beer drinkers aren't ashamed to
order.
   In the 1960s, industry watchers said light beers had been
pitched mainly as diet drinks for women.
   Michael Bellas, president of the research firm Beverage
Marketing Corp. in New York, said the country wasn't ready for a
low-calorie approach then.
   Pitching the drink to women may also have alienated some men,
which is something brewers normally try to avoid since men
reportedly consume about 80 percent of all the beer sold.
   Robert S. Weinberg, a brewing industry consultant and professor
of marketing at the John M. Olin School of Business at Washington
University in St. Louis, said another flaw in the light beers of
the 1960s was taste.
   ``They were horrible, and usually died a fast death. They didn't
taste like beer and were poorly marketed,'' he said.
   Milwaukee-based Miller began to turn that around in 1973 when it
started testing a new light beer under the Lite name it bought from
another brewer.
   ``Everything you always wanted in a beer ... and less,'' was the
original theme. The brewer used former athletes and celebrities to
sell its beer, an approach that it continues to use 15 years later.
   The approach infuriated critics who said it encouraged young
people to drink, but it helped Miller convince customers that it
was acceptable for tough guys to drink light beer.
   Others brewers were skeptical about Lite's chances and stayed
out of that end of the market for a few years.
   ``It was the only significant consumer packaged good industry
where a company could bring out imaginative new products and not
have competitors follow suit immediately,'' Weinberg said.
   By the time others woke up, Miller had a grip on the market that
it has been slow to yield.
   ``We will never enjoy that kind of competitive advantage
again,'' admitted Miller spokesman Bob Bertini.
   Beverage Marketing said 45.1 million barrels of light beer were
sold last year, up 7.1 percent from the previous year, while sales
of all kinds of beer slipped 0.2 percent to 187.2 million barrels.
There are about 70 light brands.
   Sales of Miller Lite were flat at about 19.3 million barrels,
but it is the second-best selling beer overall (Budweiser is No. 1
at about 50 million barrels) and holds a 2-to-1 lead in share of
the light beer segment.
   Its main competition comes from Bud Light from Anheuser-Busch
Inc. of St. Louis, which sold an estimated 8.6 million barrels last
year, and from Coors Light from Adolph Coors Co. of Golden, Colo.,
which sold 7.9 million barrels.
   Beverage Marketing estimates Lite held 42.8 percent of the light
segment in 1987 compared with 19.1 percent for Bud Light and 17.5
percent for Coors Light.
   Bud Light has grown at a furious pace since its introduction in
1982, scoring well in consumer surveys with ads that show quirky
responses to customers who ask for a ``light'' without specifying
the brand and with commercials featuring party animal Spuds
MacKenzie.
   Coors Light, introduced in 1977, has been advertised as the
silver bullet that ``won't slow you down'' and ``the right beer
now.'' Last year, its sales surpassed those of Coors premium beer
for the first time.
   Other leading light beers include Michelob Light at 5.8 percent
of the market and Natural Light at 5.1 percent from Anheuser-Busch.
   Stroh Brewery Co. of Detroit has captured about 6.2 percent of
the market with two brands, Old Milwaukee Light and Stroh Light.
   Light beer accounted for 24.1 percent of overall beer sales in
1987, up from 13.1 percent in 1980. Can its share growth continue?
   Weinberg said the increasing incidence of brewers attaching
their regular brands' names to light beers show brewers are taking
the segment seriously even if they are doing so partly just to get
more shelf space.
   Others say as the median age of the population moves higher,
even more people will find themselves worrying about their weight.
   ``Thirty percent of the market doesn't seem to be
unattainable,'' said Eric Shepard, executive editor of the industry
newsletter Beer Marketers Insights. ``But can it get to 40 percent,
I just don't know.''
