   The yearning for the Eastern and exotic which
made ``Scheherazade'' popular is seen in August Bournonville's 1855
ballet ``Abdallah.''
   The Royal Danish Ballet danced it with grace and beauty Friday
night, as part of its week-long Metropolitan Opera season.
   Bournonville created exciting dancing for men and these tall
Danish dancers looked splendid. The women are precise but in a
small-scaled way; their dancing is delicate and graceful. Heidi
Ryom as Irina was the most sweetly feminine of them all.
   Linda Hindberg had a small part but a good one, as the leader of
a harem, a part which allowed the ballerina to show strength in her
presentation. Alexander Kolpin was striking, in appearance and
dancing, in the title role.
   Bournonville told stories with charming simplicity and no
subplots. He wove in subtle mime gestures which explained
conversations, carrying the plot forward.
   ``Abdallah'' was out of the Royal Danish Ballet's repertory from
1858 to 1985, when the late dancer Toni Lander and dancer Flemming
Ryberg reconstructed it from Bournonville's notations on the Holger
Simon Paulli music score.
   It isn't as fast moving as ``Napoli,'' with which the Danes
opened the Met season, but it is equally as delightful.

   A federal magistrate has rejected a government
request to extradite a man to Israel to face charges in a 1986
terrorist bombing in Jerusalem, saying he was likely acting to
achieve a political aim.
   U.S. Magistrate John Caden ruled Friday there was ``probable
cause to believe'' that the defendant, Mahmoud Abed Atta, 34,
committed the bombing ``in furtherance of the political objective''
of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Therefore, Caden said Atta, who also uses the name Mahmoud
El-Abed Ahmad, was protected under the ``political offense
exception'' of U.S. law and placed him outside the jurisdiction of
the extradition treaty between the United States and Israel.
   Caden also said he had no governance over the case because Atta
had been brought to the United States ``in a constitutionally
impermissible manner.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Gleeson said the government would
seek an immediate stay of the order pending a possible appeal or
other recourse.
   ``While this court does not approve the actions taken by Ahmad,
nor does it desire to express support for either side in this
conflict, the fact remains that the conflict exists and that the
political offense exception was formulated to protect the rights of
those, whose philosophy may differ from ours, to fight for a way of
life they believe in,'' Caden said in a 72-page written decision.
   His order ``expresses no opinion as to the legitimacy of the
Palestine objectives, the Israeli treatment of the Arabs or the
legitimacy of the occupancy of the West Bank,'' he said.
   Atta, who has been described by the FBI as a member of the PLO,
has been charged with hurling a firebomb into a bus on April 12,
1986 in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The bus driver was killed
and eight passengers were injured. Two other people have been
convicted in Israel of participating in the attack.
   Atta has been held without bail at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Manhattan since his arrest in May 1987
during a flight from Venezuela to Kennedy Airport.
   Atta, who was born in Ramala on the West Bank and became an
American citizen in 1982, was held on an extradition warrant from
Israel, which does not have a treaty with Venezuela.
   A call to Atta's lawyer, Ramsey Clark, for comment was not
returned.

<HEAD>Judge Temporarily Bars Zoo From Collecting Extra Fee For Panda
Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the Toledo Zoo can
continue, at least for now, to exhibit two giant pandas on loan
from China, but the zoo can no longer collect the extra $2 fee it
has been charging.
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson on Friday granted a
preliminary injunction sought by the World Wildlife Fund and the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. The groups
wanted the pandas returned to China and their import permit
invalidated because they say the exhibit exploits an endangered
species.
   The pandas _ named Le Le and Nan Nan _ have been on exhibit at
the zoo since May 24 after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
issued the import permit.
   The wildlife fund contends the permit should not have been
issued because the zoo's plans did not meet federal requirements
that endangered animals be imported only if the importation is for
``purposes which are not detrimental to the survival of the
species'' and the animals are ``not to be used for primarily
commercial purposes.''
   Johnson said the Fish and Wildlife Service had not been aware
the zoo was charging a special fee to view the pandas so there was
no evidence the agency had even considered the commercial nature of
the exhibition.
   The wildlife fund had however ``demonstrated a likelihood of
success on the merits on this issue,'' Johnson said. But the judge
added that a full hearing on whether the exhibit should be closed
would be scheduled later.
   Ellen Efros, an attorney for the zoo, had argued before Johnson
Monday that the zoo had established the separate fee for the panda
exhibit for financial accounting purposes only.
   Ms. Efros said closing the exhibit would rob the public of a
chance to view an endangered species and learn something about
China. In addition, she said it could have a potentially harmful
effect on U.S.-Chinese relations.

<HEAD>Cuban Prison Population Lowest Since Revolution Began, Official
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's prison population has sunk to its
lowest level since the 1959 revolution following the release of
thousands of detainees under a new penal code, Cuban Justice
Minister Juan Escalona said.
   In a dispatch monitored Friday in Mexico City, the Cuban
government's Prensa Latina news agency quoted Escalona as saying
that ``several thousands of prisoners were freed'' under a
45-day-old penal code reform.
   The changes replaced mandatory jail terms with monetary fines
for 60 crimes and reduced sentences for other types of convictions,
Prensa Latina said.
   Escalona said 794 prisoners were freed because the crimes for
which they were convicted no longer existed under the reform. More
than 6,000 pending cases were retired for the same reason, he said.
   In all, nearly 22,000 penal cases were revised after the reform
was enacted, he said.
   The Prensa Latina dispatch did not identify the nature of the
cases affected or whether crimes considered political in nature
were included.
   Amnesty International, the worldwide human rights group, said in
its 1987 annual report that 450 political prisoners were being held
in Cuba.
   Escalona said that because of the modifications, ``the current
prison population is the lowest the country has had in the history
of the revolution.''
   The justice minister made his remarks in a meeting with the
national assembly's constitutional and juridical affairs commission
in Havana, the Cuban capital.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you run short of cash at the end of the
month, imagine the dismay of newly elected Mayor Art Agnos when he
found San Francisco in the same boat _ floundering in $179 million
of red ink.
   When former Mayor Dianne Feinstein turned over the reins to
Agnos in January, she boasted of the city's fiscal strength and
pointed proudly to nine consecutive years of balanced budgets.
   When she first took office, the city faced a $120 million
deficit. Once during her tenure there was a substantial surplus.
Three years ago, the city faced a $76 million deficit, but erased
it through budget cuts.
   As Feinstein left, she warned of the toll taken on city finances
by the AIDS epidemic, homeless problem, Proposition 13, and the
elimination of the federal revenue-sharing programs.
   Other factors contributing to the latest deficit, she said,
included unforeseen costs of toxic controls, comparable worth, jail
expenses, decreased water revenues and repeal of a utility tax that
cut revenue by $10 million.
   While Agnos acknowledges the problems Feinstein cited, he
criticized her administration after arriving at City Hall to find a
flood of red ink facing him for fiscal 1988-1989.
   ``Raiding reserves for a one-time fix that will simply roll the
deficit problem into the next year does not solve our budget
problem,'' Agnos said. ``In fact, that is how we got into this
deficit situation in the first place.''
   ``It's frankly to be expected,'' said Paul Varacalli, head of
Local 790 of United Public Employees, the largest representative of
city workers. ``Every year for the last decade we've gone through
this doom and gloom ... that's the way this city runs.''
   In a bid to partially refill the city's coffers, Agnos backed
Proposition K on the June 7 ballot. The measure would have allowed
San Francisco to raise strict spending limits set by the statewide
Gann initiative and collect additional taxes from businesses,
hotels and parking.
   Without that permission from voters, Agnos warned that essential
city services would suffer. He called for wage freezes and forecast
that 160 police officers would have to go, along with three fire
stations and four library branches.
   Agnos watched in dismay as voters rejected the measure, sending
a message to City Hall to live within its means.
   The voters did provide some help, approving a measure that will
save $43 million by freezing city employee salaries.
   With a July deadline looming for adoption of a tentative budget
and August deadline for the final document, battle lines are being
drawn.
   Union leaders, city supervisors, department heads, private
business executives, neighborhood representatives and city
employees are making their cases in backrooms, boardrooms and
rallies at City Hall.
   But despite the mayor's warning that there are no ``magic
bailouts,'' he appears to have found a few surprise windfalls to
help fill out the $179 million shortfall.
   A week after the election, the mayor announced the city had
discovered it mistakenly counted court-mandated expenses when
setting its spending limit.
   By excluding such expenses, Agnos said, San Francisco can raise
the limit by an estimated $20 to $30 million. That means business
taxes and fees can be implemented and public safety layoffs may not
be needed.
   A few days earlier, budget analysts said they had uncovered
about $16 million in additional spending potential because a 1981
Muni fare hike was incorrectly charged against the Gann limit.
   Agnos said he would not have put Proposition K on the ballot if
he had known the city's spending limit could be raised by excluding
court-mandated costs.
   Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce's board of directors voted
Wednesday to oppose Agnos' proposed business taxes and fees.
   Supervisor Harry Britt says he expects the mayor's budget to
gain Board of Supervisors' approval. Longtime tax foe Richard
Hongisto urged fellow supervisors to ``pull together to support the
entire package for the sake of unity.''

<TEXT>
   The government has rejected as unreal
the demands of two opposition unions for a 600 percent wage
increase as prices soared in the wake of free-market economic
reforms.
   The leftist Sandinista government said the demands of the
Workers' Federation of Nicaragua and General Federation of
Independent Workers were inflationary. Both federations are
controlled by the opposition Socialist Party.
   Authorities on Wednesday announced a huge devaluation of the
cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, a near-doubling of gasoline prices
and a general pay increase of 30 percent.
   A dollar was worth 80 cordobas at the official rate but fetched
250 cordobas on the black market Friday. Before the devaluation it
was worth 13 cordobas at the official rate.
   While the government retained subsidies for some basic foods,
prices in markets outside the rationing system soared. The cost of
a liter of milk, just over a quart, jumped from 6.6 to 21 cordobas;
a pound of meat from 50 to 100 cordobas; and a dozen eggs from 50
to 80 cordobas.
   Cab drivers ignored the official tariff of 5 cordobas for a
short trip and demanded 20. Many who own their taxis simply stayed
home on Friday.
   The primary school teachers guild announced their pay of 2,500
cordobas a month was not enough to live on. President Daniel Ortega
said he would meet with the teachers Sunday.
   While no public protests of the economic measures were held,
Ortega warned domestic critics Thursday they were ``playing with
fire'' by opposing the program.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says ``the law of averages''
dictates there will be corruption in Pentagon procurement and he
praised how federal agents have handled what Republican senators
call a bribery investigation of unprecedented scale.
   Some 275 grand jury subpoenas have been issued to companies and
individuals this week, said federal law enforcement sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III said he anticipates indictments by the end of the summer.
   But Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and Bill Chappell, D-Fla., dismissed
reports that they had come under scrutiny in the investigation,
while two more defense contractors _ Martin Marietta Corp. and LTV
Corp. _ disclosed that they had been served with subpoenas in the
probe.
   Reagan said he was ``very proud'' of the investigators who
conducted the probe without telling the president until this week.
The secret investigation meant ``there was no panicking and no
leaks or anyone running for cover,'' Reagan said on CNN's
``Moneyline.''
   But with about six million people involved in the defense
procurement process, ``the law of averages says that not all six
million are going to turn out to be heroes,'' he said.
   Dyson confirmed in a telephone interview Friday night from his
home that he and his late aide, Tom Pappas, had met with a military
consultant and former vice president of Unisys Corp., Charles
Gardner, in New York the weekend Pappas committed suicide.
   The FBI served a search warrant Tuesday on Gardner's home in
Malverne, N.Y., as well as on Unisys plants and offices in Great
Neck, N.Y. and Eagan, Minn.
   ``It was a very standard invitation to come tour their plant,
get a briefing on a number of programs Unisys is involved in,''
Dyson said, adding that as a member of the House Armed Services
Committeee, ``There's really nothing unusual about that.''
   The congressman noted that there is a Unisys facility two miles
from his home and his district includes a large Navy facility, the
Patuxent Naval Air Test Center.
   Dyson said the defense probe had nothing to do with Pappas'
suicide May 1 when he leaped to his death from a hotel room in New
York City.
   A government source familiar with the probe said that Dyson is
not under active investigation.

   The 2-year-old investigation centers on allegations that defense
contractors received secret information from former government
officials whom they hired as consultants. Public officials were
bribed as part of the scheme, according to a search warrant.
   CBS News, citing an unidentified administration official,
reported Friday that seven Defense Department employees are
suspected of accepting bribes or gifts in return for inside
information on Pentagon contracts.
   And ABC News reported that unidentified officials said the
payoffs run into millions of dollars in cash in addition to gifts
and cars.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said Friday the investigation is producing
``the most widespread case I or anyone else has ever seen.''
   Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican who sits on the
committee, said in a Senate speech that the matter is ``widespread,
beyond the wildest imagination of what's going on.''
   Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the House appropriations
subcommittee on defense, characterized as a ``bunch of bunk'' a
report Friday in The Los Angeles Times that he is under scrutiny in
the case. Chappell's panel oversees defense spending.
   A company in Chappell's congressional district, Armtec Inc. of
Palatka, Fla., is one of 15 defense contractors whose offices were
searched by FBI agents Tuesday.
   Armtec's president, William W. Roberts, is a personal friend of
the Chappell's. He said his company ``is not aware of any
wrongdoing'' and will cooperate with investigators.
   Chappell's financial disclosure form for 1987 shows that he
accepted $3,000 in speaking fees from defense firms searched by the
FBI.
   At the center of the investigation is former Pentagon official
Melvyn Paisley, whose office was bugged and telephone tapped for
two years.
   Paisley, assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems from 1981 to April 1987, is now a
Washington consultant to numerous defense contractors, including
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and United Technologies Corp. Both
companies had offices that were searched Tuesday.
   Also being looked at is retired four-star Adm. James A. ``Ace''
Lyons, who sources say was a colleague of Paisley's. Lyons is not
accused of any wrongdoing, but a warrant authorizing a search of
McDonnell Douglas offices in St. Louis sought, among other things,
documents ``relating to the work of Ace Lyons for McDonnell Douglas
from December 1987 through 1988.''
   Both Paisley and Lyons were close associates of former Navy
Secretary John F. Lehman Jr.
   The Washington Post reported today that former Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger was told when he held that office that Lehman's
office was a ``principal point of origin'' for leaks of classified
budgetary documents relating to contracts and that at least five
people had ``continuously disclosed classified documents.''
   The undated, unsigned ``talking paper'' filed in federal court
in Alexandria, Va., in early 1986, was prepared in connection with
a pending criminal case against a former defense consultant. The
Post said law enforcement officials that it did not identify said
the document is unrelated to the defense fraud probe.
   A government source told The Associated Press on Friday night
that during a meeting between Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney
conducting the investigation, and Grassley, the senator asked
Hudson whether Lehman was a target of the investigation and Hudson
replied, ``No comment.''
   The New York Times reported today that two major military
contractors, the Martin Marietta Corp. and the LTV Corp., disclosed
Friday that they were under scrutiny as part of the investigation.
   The companies also acknowledged, the Times reported, that at one
time both had retained the services of Paisley and a colleague of
his, William Galvin.

   Not everyone is complaining about the drought
baking farmland and stranding river barges, say TV weather
forecasters, who say they're prepared to take the heat for any kind
of weather.
   ``No matter what you do, you can't win,'' said Andy Avalos of
WLS-TV in Chicago, who added that some people are enjoying the
sunny weather and 90-degree temperatures accompanying the dry spell.
   Avalos was among about 200 forecasters who converged Friday
morning on a downtown hotel for the American Meteorological
Society's 18th Conference on Broadcast Meteorology.
   Forecasters may sometimes have trouble predicting the weather,
but they know they can expect scattered complaints under any
conditions.
   ``Always, no matter what the weather is, there is someone
unhappy with it,'' said Gail Lynne of KLFY-TV in Lafayette, La., a
five-year veteran of television forecasting.
   ```It's too hot, too dry, too humid,''' she said, quoting
complaints she has heard.
   ``Most people get quite angry,'' said Avalos, a 12-year veteran
of weather prediction.
   ``They always blame the weatherman when the weatherman is wrong,
of course,'' he added with a grin. ``And they always blame the
weatherman when the weather is lousy. And you can't please
everybody, regardless of what the forecast is, no matter how
accurate you are.''
   The meeting featured three days of sessions ranging from
``Numerical Probabilities in Weather Forecasting'' and
``Four-Dimensional Rendering of Satellite Data'' to ``The Weather
and Politics: Who Wins Elections When the Weather Turns Bad?''
   ``I don't think there's anything specifically on the program
that's drought-related,'' said Cheryll Jones of WAGA-TV and Cable
News Network in Atlanta, where drought has necessitated water
rationing.
   ``But I'm sure before the whole thing is over with, in some of
the sessions, it will be mentioned and discussed,'' she said.
``There's always a lot of information to be learned at a conference
like this.''
   Everybody wants to know when it's going to rain, said Eric
Nefstead of WREX-TV in Rockford, who has been doing weather for 15
years.
   ``They ask you every day, `Well, what's new today? You know, is
there any hope?''' he said.
   Added Ms. Jones, ``It's real frustrating this time of the year,
when you have the ... spotty type of showers and thundershowers,
and you can't promise everyone that they'll get one.
   ``And when they do come, they're so sparse and they're so
insignificant that in terms of the overall water needs, it's a big
letdown,'' she said, speaking from her 10 years of forecasting
experience.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Leslie Manigat has fired
his armed forces commander and two other generals to cap the first
major confrontation between the new civilian government and the
powerful military.
   A presidential communique read on national television late
Friday said Manigat had retired Commander in Chief Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy and two other members of the general staff, brigadier
generals Carl Michel Nicholas and Wilton Cherisson.
   Namphy led a three-man junta that governed Haiti for two years
until Manigat won a popular election in January. At the time,
critics lambasted Manigat as the military's puppet.
   Namphy had no immediate public response to the move.
   The communique said Namphy and other army officers had defied
Manigat's decision Wednesday to rescind an order tranfering and
retiring several high-ranking officers.
   At the center of the struggle is Col. Jean-Claude Paul, indicted
on drug-trafficking charges earlier this year by a grand jury in
Miami. Namphy wanted to demote him to an administrative post while
Manigat opposed the move.
   Manigat said Namphy's order was unconstitutional because it was
made without consulting him. The constitution names the president
as ``nominal'' chief of the armed forces and the head of the army
as the ``effective'' commander.
   ``A struggle has begun between Manigat, Namphy and Jean-Claude
Paul. Someone will have to come out on top. The personal security
of each man is at stake,'' said Hubert de Ronceray, runner-up to
Manigat in the junta-run Jan. 17 elections.
   ``Manigat was named president. He wants to prove he is not a
puppet. He will go all the way to the end,'' de Ronceray said in a
telephone interview after Namphy was fired.
   ``Perhaps he is acting by stages, to get one military man after
another under control, finally to win the good graces of the
Americans,'' he said.
   U.S. officials have backed popular elections and civilian
control in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere.
   Another major presidential candidate in the elections, Gregoire
Eugene, said, ``As soon as the first presidential communique was
issued on Wednesday, we should have expected a followup. We will
have to wait and see what happens.''
   Manigat appeared to have aligned himself with Paul when he
rescinded Namphy's order transferring Paul as commander of the
700-man Dessalines Barracks to assistant chief of staff. The
Dessalines Barracks is one of the nation's most feared army units,
and Paul reportedly refused to accept the transfer.
   Soldiers under Paul's command were blamed for widespread
violence against voters that forced cancellation of November's
independently administered general elections and left more than 30
people dead.
   It was not clear why Namphy ordered the transfer. His order
could represent a power struggle within the army, or the transfer
may involve the drug-running charges against Paul, who has denied
the accusations.
   Nicolas, one of the fired generals, denied earlier this year
that Paul was involved in drug trafficking and accused the foreign
press of singling him out for attack.
   Manigat took over on Feb. 7 from Namphy as Haiti's chief
executive. Namphy had been president of the three-man junta since
then President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in
France.
   Manigat met four hours Wednesday with the army general staff,
headed by Namphy, and obtained a statement from the staff pledging
allegiance to civilian rule and ``tentatively'' accepting Manigat's
decision to overrule Namphy's transfer of Paul.
   Manigat's decree Friday said that despite their pledge on
Wednesday, Namphy and other members of the general staff began to

   It said their action ``is a sort of insubordination ... toward
the constitutional commander in chief.''
   The communique said all Cabinet members endorsed Manigat's
action, including Defense Minister Williams Regala, who was the
other military member with Namphy on the junta.

<HEAD>Britain Expels Israeli Diplomat, PLO Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain has ordered the expulsions of an Israeli
diplomat and a PLO official and expressed irritation with Israeli
spying after a Palestinian double agent was convicted of weapons
violations.
   The Foreign Office said Friday it was expelling Israeli attache
Arie Regev and the PLO's London press officer, Zaki al Hawa,
``because of activities incompatible with their diplomatic duties.''
   The phraseology is used as a euphemism for espionage. The
ministry gave no other details of their activities.
   It said they must leave the country by the end of June.
   Friday's order came a day after a British court convicted a
Palestinian on weapons charges. Prosecutors had accused him of
spying for Israel while he did favors for the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The ministry made it clear that Britain had expressed annoyance
that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had not kept Britain
informed of its operations here.
   Mossad's failure to do so cost Scotland Yard a chance to arrest
a PLO member linked to the murder of an Arab cartoonist in London
last summer.
   The ministry also disclosed that Israeli Ambassador Yehuda Avner
was told in October that a former member of his staff, attache
Jacob Barad, would not be allowed to return to Britain.
   Reports published today said Barad, who arrived in London in
1984 and left in the summer of 1987, was suspected of coordinating
the work of Mossad with Regev, who also arrived here in 1984.
   It is believed to be the first time that Israeli diplomats have
been declared persona non grata in Britain since diplomatic
relations were established after Israel was founded 40 years ago.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry spokesman regretted that
Britain ``has seen fit to take measures of the kind adopted. Israel
did not act against any British interests.''
   The PLO office said it was dismayed by the expulsion order on al
Hawa and contrasted its own ``constant respect for British law''
with Israel's ``flagrant disregard'' of it.
   The expulsions came a day after a 28-year-old Palestinian,
Ishmael Sowan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. He was
convicted in Old Bailey criminal court Wednesday of possessing
explosives, grenades and rifles.
   Prosecutors said he kept the weapons for Abder Mustapha, a PLO
member suspected of arranging the shooting death of Arab cartoonist
Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami. But Sowan was at the same time spying on
Mustapha for Mossad, the prosecution alleged.
   In its trial coverage, The Times of London said Mossad failed to
tell British authorities that Mustapha was in Britain. Britain had
issued an exclusion order against Mustapha and was unaware he had
returned.
   News reports said the exclusion order against Mustapha was
issued because of suspicion about his activities _ not evidence of
an offense.
   Sowan was arrested in Augustwhen police were investigating the
shooting of the cartoonist. However, he was not a murder suspect.
   Sowan testified that the weapons found in his house in the
eastern port city of Hull belonged to Mustapha. Police said
Mustapha fled to the Middle East after Al-Adhami was shot.
   The Times said Mustapha was linked to murders of three Israeli
vacationers on a yacht at Larnaca, Cyprus, in June 1986. He also
was wanted in connection with an attack on an Israeli El Al bus in
West Germany in 1970, the newspaper said.
   The British Foreign Office said it understood that al Hawa, 47,
who arrived here last year, was a member of Force 17, which
provides personal security for PLO leader Yasser Arafat and senior
officials overseas.
   However, it said there was no evidence the PLO office in London
was involved in operations the guerrilla movement was planning.
   The Times said today that the activities of intelligence agents
from friendly countries ``are usually tolerated'' in Britain and
that Mossad's work ``has until now been welcomed because the
Israelis are seen as being exceptionally effective against Arab
terrorism.''
   But another daily newspaper, the Independent, said Regev's
expulsion ``reflected mounting British criticism of Mossad's
activities'' in Britain.
   Mossad was alleged to have been involved in the attempted
abduction in London in 1984 of a former Nigerian Cabinet minister,
Umaru Dikko, who was wanted in Lagos for alleged corruption.
   The family of Mordechai Vanunu claimed the former Israeli
technician was lured from Britain by a Mossad agent and kidnapped
after disclosing his country's nuclear secrets to a British
newspaper.
   A month after Vanunu's disappearance in September 1986, Israel
acknowledged he was in custody in Israel. He was sentenced in March
to 18 years in prison for treason and espionage.

<TEXT>
   A human rights lawyer who
represented a top Communist Party official was assasinated today as
he swept his front yard near the U.S. Clark Air Base, police said.
   Police said gunmen casually approached Ramos Cura, 44, as he
worked in his front yard and shot him several times. The assailants
fled on foot.
   Cura was the 27th person killed in this city since last month
and the seventh in June, police records show. Most of the killings
have remained unsolved and residents have complained about the rash
of violence in Angeles, home of the U.S. 13th Air Force.
   The victim was a lawyer of jailed communist leader Rodolfo
Salas, allegedly a former chairman of the Communist Party of the
Philippines which has waged a 19-year insurgency against the
government.
   Cura was also the secretary of the Pampanga provincial chapter
of the leftwing nationalist organization BAYAN.
   Police said they had no suspects on the killing.
   In a related development, suspected communist rebels ambushed
and killed constabulary Sgt. Arcadio Dizon late Friday in
neighboring Tarlac province. A militiaman on board the same jeep
with Sgt. Dizon escaped unhurt, the military reported.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
backed by mortar fire, have captured a Vietnamese defense outpost
near the Thai-Cambodian border after three days of fighting, Thai
sources said today.
   The sources, who monitored the fighting from the key Thai border
town of Aranyaprathet, said the guerrillas first attacked
Vietnamese forces opposite the Thai village of Baan Phansuek on
Wednesday.
   The Vietnamese attempted to repulse the attackers with artillery
and mortar fire but were outnumbered by the Khmer Rouge who seized
the outpost Friday, the sources said.
   The fighting occured while Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach and his Thai counterpart Siddhi Savetsila met in Bangkok to
discuss ways to end the 9-year-old conflict in Cambodia. Both
expressed optimism that a political solution could be found.
Neither wants to see the Khmer Rouge return to power in Cambodia.
   The sources said the Vietnamese were moving artillery to a
hilltop near the scene of the fighting and might attempt to
recapture the outpost.
   Col. Chainarong Noonpakdee, deputy commander of the Burapa
(Eastern) Field Force said in a telephone interview that no
fighting was reported today. He said he could not confirm that the
Vietnamese position had fallen to the guerrillas.
   Some artillery and mortar rounds from the fighting landed inside
Thailand, forcing the evacuation of about 350 villagers living
along the frontier, the officer said.
   Chainarong said Thai troops guarding the border responded by
firing warning shots into Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge are the strongest of three Cambodian guerrilla
groups fighting Vietnamese forces who invaded Cambodia in late
1978. A Vietnamese offensive in late 1984 and early 1985 wiped out
the major guerrilla bases along the Thai-Cambodian border and the
three groups have since reverted to small unit, insurgency-style
warfare.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam invaded
it in late 1978. The ultra-leftist group killed millions of
Cambodians during its rule, pushing a radical brand of agrarian
communism.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted robber who doubled as a
street vendor and poet has been sentenced to hang for the murder of
reggae star Peter Tosh and two of his friends.
   A jury of eight women and four men took six minutes Friday to
convict Dennis Lobban, 33, on three counts of murder.
   Justice Carl Patterson then sentenced him to hang.
   Throughout the trial which began Monday, Lobban insisted he was
innocent. He claimed he was drinking with friends far from Tosh's
house the night of Sept. 11, 1987, when Tosh, radio disc jockey
Jeff Dixon and Wilton ``Doc'' Brown were gunned down during a
robbery at Tosh's home.
   Four others survived the attack.
   Lobban, a convicted felon with a long police record, was out on
parole when the murders were committed.
   Steve Russell, 26, of Kingston, who had been charged jointly
with Lobban, was freed on Thursday. Russell's lawyer argued
successfully that the prosecution failed to show Russell was
involved in the slayings.
   Russell claimed he only drove the killers to Tosh's home without
going inside or knowing they were going to kill Tosh.
   Lobban is a ``higgler,'' or street vendor, and a ``dub poet,''
who recites poetry to reggae music. He has been convicted of eight
previous felons, ranging from illegal possession of firearms to
armed robbery.
   Lobban was escorted from court by armed guards and taken to
prison to join 188 other people on death row.
   Any appeal would go to the Jamaican Court of Appeal. The final
court of appeal is the Privy Council in England.
   Tosh, 42 years old at the time of his death, was nominated for a
Grammy in 1985 for his album, ``Captured Live.''
   In 1963, Tosh, Bob Marley and Neville Livingstone formed the
group The Wailers, which catapulted reggae's easy rhythms from the
slums of Kingston onto the world stage.
   Born Winston Herbert MacIntosh, Tosh left The Wailers in 1973.
One later Tosh group was Word, Sound and Power.
   Outside Jamaica, Tosh was perhaps best known for his
collaboration with Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger on the
Smokey Robinson song, ``(You Got To) Walk and Don't Look Back,''
and for his hit, ``Legalize It,'' a plea for the legalization of
marijuana.

   Media magnate Rupert Murdoch has proposed
putting his Boston UHF television station in an independent trust
to meet a June 30 deadline that he comply with government rules
limiting ownership of newspaper and television stations in the same
city.
   Murdoch, who owns WFXT-TV and the Boston Herald had said he

avail himself of the trust option allowed by the Federal
Communications Commission as a method of complying with the
cross-ownership rule.
   Lawrence Kessler, general counsel of Murdoch's company, News
America Publishing Inc., said the trust was chosen because ``it
seemed a more appropriate thing to do right now. It lets us remain
the beneficiary of what we believe will be a valuable property.''
   Under terms of the trust agreement, Murdoch would relinquish
control of the station but would still receive profits from the
trust which he proposed be be managed by former Sen. Edward Brooke

   The Senate has passed a bill that experts

the human genetic pattern.
   The Biotechnology Competitiveness Act passed the Senate Friday
88-1, with Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., casting the lone
dissenting vote.
   Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology
Association, said the 88 to 1 vote ``shows the overwhelming support

   Although the bill doesn't authorize the start of any laboratory
research, it sets a framework for what experts believe may be a $3
billion project that could begin in two years.
   The bill's four major provisions establishes a 20-member
national policy board to review federal research support efforts
and to make recommendations on biotechnology issues, establishes an
advisory panel to develop a strategy needed for a project to map
and sequence the human genetic pattern, establishes a $10 million
biotechnology information center at the National Library of
Medicine and would reauthorize a biomedical ethics board that would
analyze the reports of the other two panels.

   President Joaquin
Balaguer has fired the country's top military official, replacing
him with a man once accused of plotting Balaguer's ouster.
   Interior Minister Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin, 60, was chosen
Friday to replace Lt. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, the armed forces
minister. Wessin y Wessin was an unsuccessful presidential
candidate in 1968 and 1982 elections.
   Rafael Marion-Landais, minister of commerce and industry, at the
center of a heated debate this week over food prices, was also
replaced Friday by businessman Juan Valerio Sanchez, president of
the Dominican Federation of Businessmen.
   Marion-Landais angered many Dominicans when he was asked in a
press conference what people should do in the face of rising food
prices and he replied, ``Those who can, should buy it.''
   The presidential decree reinstated Wessin y Wessin, who had
retired, into the army. Wessin y Wessin was interior minister in
1971 when Balaguer sent him into exile.
   No replacement was named immediately for Wessin y Wessin in the
ministry of interior, which is in charge of domestic security.
   The decree gave no explanation why Imbert Barrera, 66, had been
replace. He is the only surviving member of the group of 12 men who
in 1961 ambushed and assassinated dictator Rafael L. Trujillo.
   The national congress declared Imbert Barrera a national hero
and general-for-life in 1962 for his role in bringing an end to the
30-year-old dictatorship.
   Former President Juan Bosch, leader of the leftist Dominican
Liberation Party, has charged recently that the military was
plotting to carry out terrorist acts as a ruse for arresting
leftists, who would be blamed for the terrorism.
   Balaguer, 80, has been president of the Dominican Republic for
16 of the last 21 years. He was elected in 1986 to his fifth
presidential term after having been out of office for eight years.
   In 1963, Wessin y Wessin and other military officers
participated in an overthrow of Bosch that eventually led to a 1965
civil war, which a U.S. invasion put down. It was Wessin y Wessin
who led the fight against the rebels and asked the United States to
intervene.
   After the civil war, Wessin y Wessin was sent to Panama as a
military attache. In 1968, retired from the army, he ran
unsuccessfully for president as the candidate of a small,
conservative party that he founded.
   In a nationally televised live broadcast in 1971, Balaguer
accused Wessin y Wessin of conspiring with other officers to
overthrow the government. Balaguer sent him into exile in Spain.
   Wessin y Wessin returned in 1978, just 10 days after Balaguer
lost that year's presidential elections. Wessin y Wessin was a
presidential candidate again in 1982. He backed Balaguer's
successful campaign in 1986 and became interior minister. In recent
days he has called for Balaguer's reelection in 1990.

   President Jose Sarney fired the military
chief of staff after the general publicly criticized the civilian
government's economic policies.
   Air Force Gen. Paulo Roberto Camarinha, 65, was ousted Friday
after giving a nearly one-hour interview Thursday night to the
government news agency EBN.
   The announcement of the firing was made by Ronaldo Costa Couto,
Sarney's chief of staff. He refused to give a reason for the
dismissal and said only that a replacement would be named later.
   In Thursday's interview, Camarinha criticized the planning
minister and an economic program imposed by Sarney that froze the
salaries of civil servants to combat runaway inflation.
   ``Salaries are frozen and prices shoot up everyday. To deny this
is impossible,'' he said in the interview. ``All you have to do is
go to the supermarket, the malls. Shops are empty. If things are
like this now, what's going to happen in 1989?''
   Camarinha is one of six military ministers in the
civilian-controlled Cabinet of Sarney. He is the first military
official to be fired under Sarney, who took office in 1985 when the
armed forces voluntarily returned to the barracks after 21 years in
power.
   Camarinha, who has 44 years of service, is also the first
top-ranking military officer to be publicly critical of the Sarney
government. In the armed forces, he was highly regarded and very
popular because he always stood up for their rights.
   Rotated among the army, navy and air force, the position of
joint chief of staff is not considered the most important military
posts but it is one of the top six.
   Army Minister Gen. Leonidas Goncalves was in China and his
ministry refused to comment when contacted by telephone by The
Associated Press. Goncalves is one of Sarney's closest advisers.
   Sarney, who led the military-supported government party during
the armed forces' regime, was chosen by the outgoing military as
the running mate of the late Tancredo Neves, who died before taking
office.
   Sarney, who became president in his place, seldom makes
decisions of great magnitude without consulting the military first.
   There was no immediate comment from the other military
ministries.
   Camarinha criticized congress and judicial system officials who
earn up to the equivalent of $7,000 a month. He called them
``maharajas,'' a Portuguese term for corrupt officials.
   He also criticized Planning Minister Joao Batista de Abreu for
the country's galloping inflation, expected to reach 600 percent by
the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   A prominent historian said famed revolutionary
Leon Trotsky should be exonerated along with other leaders falsely
accused and purged in the early years of the Soviet state.
   ``We have to rehabilitate all those people who were repressed
and who were accused on false evidence, and all those accused must
be rehabilitated,'' Yuri Afanasyev said Friday. ``And in line with
those people is Trotsky.''
   Afanasyev, in one of the boldest proposals to date since leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev undertook his ``glasnost'' campaign for
greater openness, also called for publication in the Soviet Union
of Trotsky's banned works.
   Exonerating Trotsky of criminal charges would be another major
step toward the rehabilitation of early Soviet leaders who were
purged and killed by Kremlin leader Josef Stalin.
   Publishing Trotsky's work and revoking the criminal charges
against him would continue an intensifying campaign against the
legacy of Stalin, who died in 1953.
   It could also lead to reexamination of the key role that Trotsky
played in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, creating the Red Army and
leading the Communists to victory against counterrevolutionaries in
the ensuing Russian Civil War.
   That might lead Soviet historians to reevaluate the role played
by Vladmir I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, who relied
heavily on Trotsky during the early years of Bolshevik rule.
   The Soviets have already taken several steps in this direction,
even publishing an article mildly critical of Lenin.
   The journal Novy Mir reported this month that Lenin was
excessively harsh in abolishing all private property, establishing
labor camps, and heavily taxing peasants. The article said Lenin
later saw that he was wrong.
   Following Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin defeated Trotsky in a
power struggle, forcing him out of the Communist Party in 1927 and
out of the Soviet Union two years later.
   Trotsky was accused of leading an anti-Soviet plot and was
murdered in Mexico City in 1940, reportedly on Stalin's orders.
   Until last fall, Trotsky was a ``non-person'' in the Soviet
Union, his writings and works universally condemned.
   Asked whether the works of Trotsky and former Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev might be published soon, Afanasyev answered:
   ``I can speak on behalf on myself and think they should be
republished and accessible for all ... I think it's very strange
when professors and teachers try to criticize Trotsky while they
haven't read a single word by Trotsky,'' Afanasyev told a news
conference at the Foreign Ministry press center.
   Afanasyev said that exonerating Trotsky of criminal charges and
publishing his books would not constitute an endorsement of his
ideas, which are out of line with the more liberal policies of
Gorbachev.
   Trotsky, born Lev Bronstein, was the son of a prosperous Jewish
farmer. He helped direct the coup that brought the Bolsheviks to
power, then became commissar for foreign affairs and later war,
creating and commanding the Red Army.
   He is known as the main advocate of the ``Theory of Permanent
Revolution,'' which held that the Bolshevik Revolution was a
prelude to class uprisings throughout Europe.
   After the death of Lenin, Stalin rallied his forces under the
slogan of ``Socialism in One Country,'' arguing that a socialist
state could be created in the Soviet Union, despite the failure of
revolutions elsewhere in Europe.
   Trotsky also advocated raising capital for building up industry
at the expense of the peasants. Stalin, at that time, called for
leniency against the peasants, backing a policy authored by Nikolai
Bukharin and supported by the two other leading Bolsheviks, Lev
Kamenev and Gregory Zinoviev.
   Trotsky was feared by his rivals for his skills as an orator and
organizer, his popularity among youth and his support in the Red
Army.
   Following the defeat of Trotsky, Stalin switched tactics, and
together with Kamenev and Zinoviev, began forced collectivization
of agriculture from 1929 to 1932, causing a famine and costing the
lives of millions of peasants.
   Stalin later had Bukharin, Kamenev and Zinoviev tried, sentenced
and executed in the purges of 1936-37.
   Bukharin, whose ideas are similar to those advocated by
Gorbachev, was exonerated of criminal charges in February, as were
Kamenev and Zinoviev on Monday.
   The Soviet Supreme Court on Monday also exonerated Karl Radek
and Gregory Pyatakov, who were convicted in 1937 of plotting with
Trotsky against Stalin.
   The exoneration of Radek and Pyatakov raised the possibility
that Trotsky might receive similar treatment. None of those
exonerated would be fully rehabilitated until their party
membership was restored.
   Gorbachev, in a major speech Nov. 2, became the first Soviet
leader in decades to mention Trotsky publicly, but he condemned
Trotsky's call for world revolution.

   International drug smugglers linked to
Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega conspired to import more than
$1 billion worth of cocaine and marijuana into the United States, a
federal indictment charges.
   The 25-count indictment unsealed Friday at Lafayette police
headquarters accused 170 people of smuggling 500,000 pounds of
drugs, some of it through south Louisiana, and with plotting to
smuggle in at least another million pounds.
   The total value of the drugs involved was placed at more than $1
billion, and U.S. Attorney Joe Cage called it perhaps the largest
U.S. narcotic smuggling ring ever. He said the organization planned
to ``flood'' the United States with illicit drugs.
   ``Its sole motivation, greed and money, caused its scope and
influence to transcend local, national and international
boundaries,'' Cage said.
   Friday's charges were a spinoff from the same federal
investigation that resulted in the indictment of Noriega on charges
that he laundered U.S. drug money through Panamanian banks, said
lawyers involved in the case.
   The Louisiana indictments disclosed that that Noriega allegedly
laundered profits from the sale of marijuana shipped to a Louisiana
shipyard.
   Had Noriega not been indicted on drug charges in Florida, he
probably would have been here, said the attorney for the federal
task force that coordinated the multistate investigation.
   ``I can't speak for a grand jury but, in my opinion, there would
have been sufficient evidence for an indictment (of Noriega),''
said Judith Lombardino, lawyer for the federal Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Force.
   Also Friday, a federal grand jury in Denver indicted a purported
Colombian drug lord, Pablo Emilio Escobar-Gaviria, identified as a
principal in the Medellin drug cartel of Medellin, Colombia.
   The five-count indictment alleges that Escobar-Gaviria, 39, and
five others planned to ship up to 800 kilograms of cocaine a week
into the Denver area. Authorities estimated that amount of cocaine
could have a street value of up to $17 million.
   Escobar also is under federal indictment in Florida on charges
of conspiracy to import and distribute drugs, said U.S. Attorney
Michael J. Norton.
   Sixty-five of those charged in the 131-page Louisiana indictment
were identified as ``John Doe,'' and Cage would not say if the
indictment had connections with the Medellin Cartel, thought to be
responsible for much of the cocaine sold in the United States.
   Several arrests were made, but Cage refused to say how many. Nor
would he identify any of those indicted as ringleaders, saying each
played ``a vital role in the success of the organization.''
   The charges resulted from a 2{-year-old federal investigation
that stretched into Florida, North Carolina and Michigan, Cage said.
   About 500,000 pounds of marijuana was imported to and
distributed from Lafayette and several thousand pounds of cocaine
was flown to Shreveport, he said.
   The indictment also said 280,000 pounds of the marijuana entered
through the south Louisiana region known as Acadiana.
   The indictment said 250,000 pounds of Colombian marijuana was
seized on June 18, 1983, aboard a barge in the Vermilion Parish
community of Bancker. An additional 30,000 pounds of marijuana was
seized a few days later at a nearby house, Cage said.
   The indictment said the plan was to unload the drugs at the
Intracoastal Drydock and Shipbuilding Co., owned and operated by
the Faciane family of Abbeville. William E. Faciane and James C.
Faciane were among those indicted, Cage said.
   ``This organization schemed to flood this country and its people
with illegal drugs,'' he said. ``It is sophisticated,
well-orchestrated and rivals any multinational corporation.
   The information that led to the Louisiana indictments also led
to 82 federal indictments earlier in Florida, North Carolina and
Michigan, Cage said. Among those 82 was Noriega.

<HEAD>Tribal Rebels Reportedly Kidnap Five Traders Before Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>

   Tribal rebels kidnapped five businessmen
as the government prepared to re-open efforts to end an 11-year-old
bush war that has claimed 4,000 lives, military sources said today.
   The rebels, who are Buddhists from the Chakma tribe, abducted
the five traders at gunpoint Thursday and Friday in the Chittagong
Hill Tracts about 200 miles southeast of Dhaka, according to the
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Chakmas want autonomy for their ancestral homeland near the
Indian border and resent government efforts to send settlers to the
hill tracts. Most of the settlers are Bengali-speaking Moslems.
   The kidnapped traders, who were identified only as
Bengali-speakers, were abducted in the border towns of Dighinala
and Mahalchari in the Khagrachari district.
   The military sources, who were contacted in Khagrachari, said
the rebels had killed nearly 80 people in the district since
January. In addition, they have kidnapped more than 50 fishermen
and about 10 woodcutters in the district in the last three months.
   The Bangladeshi government has no figures on the numbers of
rebels killed, but Chakma leaders across the border in India claim
2,000 of their people have disappeared. In 1987, Amnesty
International said there were ``increasing reports of arbitrary
arrests, torture and extrajudicial executions'' of tribespeople by
Bangladeshi troops in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
   Meanwhile, state-run Radio Bangladesh said government officials
would meet Sunday with members of the Chittagong Hill Tracts'
People's Solidarity Association to renew efforts to end the bush
war. The association has been serving as a mediator in talks
between the government and the rebels.
   Peace talks broke off in April when the rebels refused to give
up their demands for autonomy and when the government refused to
let India supervise the repatriation of tribal refugees who fled
across the border to India.
   In the last two years, more than 50,000 tribespeople have fled
to the Indian state of Tripura to escape the fighting.
   The hill tracts have a population of about 600,000 tribespeople,
most of whom are Chakmas, and about 300,000 Moslem settlers.

   The Chinese government has told the United
States it would be willing to offer Cambodian guerrilla leader Pol
Pot and his top aides permanent asylum in an effort reach a
poltical settlement to end the nine-year conflict in the Southeast
Asian nation, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions that U.S.
sources said private statements by Chinese officials, as recently
as last week at an unnannounced meeting with the country's new
foreign minister Qian Qichen at the United Nations, have indicated
the shift in posture toward Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.
   The sources told the newpaper the Chinese, who have provided
military aid to the Khmer Rouge, have not discussed the specifics
of Pol Pot's removal from Cambodia, where in China he and his aides
would be settled or when the government in Beijing would halt its
aid to the guerrillas.
   The reported discusssions represent the first time the Chinese
have indicated they are ready to move away from their ``bleed
Vietnam'' campaign to accepting a political settlement in the
region.
   The issue of the Khmer Rouge, blamed for the deaths of 1 million
to 2 million Cambodians during their rule in Phnom Penh from 1975
to 1978, has been an obstacle to settlment of the war in Cambodia.
   U.S. officials said the Reagan administration has not made a
decision on a Soviet request to join it as an international
``guarantor'' of a Cambodia deal. But the Cambodian issue may be
the top agenda item when the six foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations meet with Secretary of State
George Shultz in Bangkok July 6-9 the ambassadors told the
newspaper.

   A scenic poster sent to thousands of
business leaders promoting Florida's sunny, sultry beaches wasn't
exactly picture perfect.
   The state Division of Economic Development's poster shows a pier
and sailboat and the kind of sunset found only in Florida. Er, make
that California.
   Turns out the picture used for Florida's ad campaign actually
was shot in Manhattan Beach, Calif.
   ``Obviously it's embarrassing,'' said division director Steve
Mayberry. ``We intended for this to be a Florida shot.''
   The mistake was noticed by a California newspaper reporter who
said he was getting phone calls about the poster. KCBS-TV in Los
Angeles tracked it down and made a video of the real pier in nearby
Manhattan Beach.
   ``It's the spitting image,'' CBS-Florida reporter Dick Kane said.
   The state saved several thousand dollars by using an advertising
agency's stock photo instead of hiring a photographer to shoot a
picture for the poster, Mayberry said.
   ``They changed account executives and somewhere in the process
we didn't make sure that this picture was taken in Florida,''
Mayberry said.
   The idea of the poster was to ``keep our name before these
corporate executives to let them know that one of the advantages we
have here in Florida is gorgeous weather and a gorgeous
lifestlyle,'' Mayberry said.

   She got a marriage proposal, printed on a banner that fluttered
behind a plane as it buzzed over the ceremony Thursday. It read,
``Kris. I love you. Please Marry Me! Den.''
   Miss Johnson, 18, sitting in the third row with her classmates,
said yes and flung herself into the arms of her boyfriend, Denny
Peters, 22, who bolted across the lawn to hug her during his aerial
proposal Thursday.
   Miss Johnson smothered him with kisses and yeses, much to the
delight of the crowd, which had been sitting solemnly during the
commencement speech but went wild with applause during the proposal.
   ``I wasn't romantic until I met her,'' said Peters, who paid
$200 for the plane message. ``She brings it out in me. The person
you love the most should know it the most, at least in the grandest

<HEAD>66 People Arrested For Trafficking In Teenage Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have broken a nationwide ring
trafficking in teenage girls, arresting 66 people involved in
kidnapping and selling more than 200 girls into slavery, an
official report said today.
   The girls, most of whom were abducted at train stations, were
raped before they were sold, the Peasants Daily said.
   Authorities were in the process of locating and freeing the
girls, the report said.
   They were tipped off in November 1987 when a 17-year-old girl
identified her abductor, but the report did not say when the
arrests were made.
   The ring was based in Zhengzhou, a transportation center in
Henan province, in central China, but operated throughout central,
southern and western China, covering more than 20 provinces, the
report said.
   Members of the well-organized operation were responsible for
specific tasks, including management, sales, communications and
abducting the ``goods,'' the paper said.
   The girls were given code names, depending on which part of the
country they came from, how they were abducted or their marital
status.
   Girls who were married were called ``white goods,'' those who
were single were referred to as ``yellow goods.''
   The girls were fooled into thinking their abductors would find
them a job or wanted them to be their adopted sisters or daughters,
the report said.
   A 15-year-old girl who ran away from home after fighting with
her parents, was picked up at the railroad station in Xian, Shanxi
province, raped and sold to Anhui province. She was later resold
for $730, it said.
   Two girls from Sichuan province, one 15 years old and the other
16, were on their way home after visiting relatives in Zhengzhou
when they were abducted at the Zhengzhou railway station. One was
sold for $810, the other for $946, the paper said.
   All three girls were severely beaten by their owners and
forbidden to leave the house.
   The report quoted an officer of the Zhengzhou Public Security
Bureau as saying that while the crimes were not the direct result
of China's reform policies, they were caused by economic reforms
that have forced peasants to leave the farm and forced workers out
of jobs.
   He also criticized the peasants who bought the girls for their
ignorance of the law. He said when authorities went to free a girl
in Shandong province, angry peasants tried to stop them, saying,
``We don't steal, we don't rob. We used our own money to buy a
girl. What's wrong with that?''

<HEAD>Bodies Go Unburied As Cemetery Workers Strike Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 bodies remain unburied during
the third week of a cemetery workers strike south of the city, and
some of the 17 funeral homes warned they soon may run out of
storage space for caskets.
   ``We have ample storage space for about a month,'' said Gene
Dessem, an embalmer at White Oaks Chapel in San Carlos. ``But soon
we might have to move to storing the bodies in warehouses.''
   Funeral homes are bearing an unfair burden, said Ivana Flynn,
administrator at Crippen and Flynn Funeral Home in Redwood City.
   ``It should be against the law,'' she said. ``Human bodies being
stuck somewhere, waiting to be buried. I don't think that's right.''
   Garden Chapel in South San Francisco is using a garage as a
temporary holding place for eight bodies awaiting burial.
   Richard Noftsger, the funeral home's manager, said the mortuary
is embalming all bodies that will not be immediately buried, even
if the family did not desire it.
   While mortuary workers said the biggest inconvenience would be
for families waiting to bury their loved ones, one mortuary
official said she believed leaving bodies unburied was a serious
health hazard.
   ``Especially in the summertime. Our refrigeration unit only can
fit one or two,'' said Ivana Flynn, administrator of Crippen and
Flynn Funeral Home in Redwood City.
   Mortuaries are using special embalming methods to preserve the
bodies for an extended period, Dessem said.
   The walkout centers on claims by the workers' union that under
current provisions, cemeteries can hire subcontractors for work
usually performed by union employees.
   About 150 union members responsible for burials, gardening and
general maintenance at 17 cemeteries walked off the job May 30, two
days after contract talks broke down. The three-year contract
expired in March.
   Talks were scheduled through the weekend, but picketers said
they would stay ``a whole year'' outside the cemetery gates if they
have to.
   At Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, management said they were
handling most of the routine grounds maintenance, such as mowing
grass. Managers at most of the other cemeteries declined to discuss
how they've been coping with the strike. Last week, members of the
Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendant Union Local 265 met with the
East Bay Interment Properties Association. Those talks ended June
11 and the union is now negotiating a separate contract with
another cemetery association, Associated Cemeteries, owners said.
   The East Bay Interment group includes cemeteries in Oakland,
Berkeley and El Cerrito. Associated Cemeteries represents
cemeteries primarily in Colma.
   During a 1985 strike by cemetery workers in the Bay Area, about
800 bodies went unburied.

   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, cleared of
criminal charges that he tried to hide a campaign loan, says he's
considering a new bid for the post he lost to a Senate impeachment
conviction.
   ``That one (the governorship) will come up in 1990 and yes,
that's certainly an option,'' Mecham told reporters Friday, adding
there also was ``always a chance'' of a campaign this year for U.S.
Senate or Congress.
   A jury on Thursday acquittted Mecham and his brother, Willard,
on criminal charges of concealing the $350,000 campaign loan.
   The 64-year-old Republican was removed from office April 4 when
the state Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts.
   Mecham told reporters after the verdict that he had no
vindictive feelings. But he accused Attorney General Bob Corbin of
abusing his office and vowed to support a petition drive to recall
the prosecutor.
   ``We went through eight months of misery'' after Corbin's
investigation of the campaign loan began last fall, Mecham said.
``Thank God those jurors could see through the accusations and get
to the facts.''
   The former governor also accused a Court of Appeals judge _ whom
he did not name _ of ruling on an appeal in his criminal case
despite having ``openly declared that I was dishonest and should be
in jail.''
   Mecham's attorney, Michael Scott, said a complaint might be
filed with the state Bar Association's judicial ethics committee.
   Willard Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, said
testifying before state grand juries was ``by far the most evil
experiences I have ever had. The perjury in this case was committed
by the state attorneys who prosecuted us.''
   Evan Mecham said he felt vindicated ``on the legal issues, but
justice in the political arena will take a little longer.''
   Mecham said his political action committee, Forward Arizona,
will work to elect a Legislature ``that represents the people, and
not the hidden power brokers.''
   He said the group will consider starting an alternative
newspaper to counter what he views as a biased Phoenix press. Plans
are in the works for two books, a TV movie and a feature film, he
said, joking that he would like to be portrayed by actor Clint
Eastwood.
   He said his legal defense cost about $550,000, almost half of
which has been contributed by supporters.
   During a news conference at his private office, Mecham was
jubilant while his brother often appeared on the verge of tears.
Afterward, Mecham cut a cake that said ``Truth Prevails _ Evan and
Willard.''
   Mecham was prosecuted for failing to itemize the $350,000
campaign loan from attorney-developer Barry Wolfson on either his
personal or campaign finance reports.
   The defense contended the loan was properly reported as part of
a $465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from Mecham, and that
the failure to itemize it was an innocent mistake by Willard Mecham.
   Mecham was acquitted of all six charges of perjury, willful
concealment and filing false documents. His brother was acquitted
of three similar counts.

<HEAD>Astronomers Reject Naming Uranian Moons After Challenger's Crew</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A panel of scientists has recommended naming
the moons of Uranus after the literary characters of William
Shakespeare and Alexander Pope rather than the crew killed when the
space shuttle Challenger exploded.
   ``We're following the tradition of naming the moons after
Shakespearean characters and characters from (Alexander Pope's)
`The Rape of the Lock,''' said U.S. Geological Survey planetary
geologist Hal Masursky, who chairs the International Astronomical
Union's planetary system nomenclature working group.
   ``It wasn't intended to be a slight'' to the thousands of
schoolchildren, citizens and officials who wrote letters and signed
petitions proposing naming the moons for the astronauts, Brian
Marsden, director of the IAU's Central Bureau for Astronomical
Telegrams, said Friday.
   He said seven asteroids were named for Challenger astronauts two
months after the shuttle exploded after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986. The
IAU also will name seven lunar craters for Francis Scobee, Michael
J. Smith, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory
Jarvis and teacher-astronaut Sharon Christa McAuliffe, he said.
   Uranus has 15 known moons, 10 of which were discovered in
December 1985 and January 1986 by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The
probe's triumphant Jan. 24, 1986, close encounter with Uranus was
overshadowed by the Challenger tragedy.
   Marsden said the IAU's executive committee decided in a private
meeting in San Diego last September to endorse the proposal by
Masursky's working group to name nine new moons for Shakespearean
characters _ Juliet, Puck, Bianca, Cordelia, Cressida, Desdemona,
Ophelia, Rosalind and Portia. The 10th will be named after Belinda,
whose lock of hair was stolen in ``The Rape of the Lock.''
   The IAU general assembly is certain to rubber-stamp the proposal
on the last day of its Aug. 2-11 meeting in Baltimore, Md., Marsden
said.
   ``Astronomers feel that even though the moons were discovered by
the United States, the satellites really are international,
therefore going along with tradition would have international
acceptance,'' Marsden said by phone from Cambridge, Mass.
   ``Naming features or moons is not the property of any one
country,'' Masursky said.
   Of Uranus' five previously known moons, Oberon, Titania and
Miranda are Shakespearean names, Umbriel is from Pope's poem, while
Ariel is a name found in both ``The Rape of the Lock'' and
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' Marsden said.
   The craters to be named for Challenger's crew measure 20 to 60
miles wide and are located ``in an enormous crater named Apollo on
the far side of the moon,'' Masursky said by phone from Flagstaff,
Ariz.

   A homemade grenade wounded four
British soldiers as scattered violence flared early today in
Northern Ireland.
   Police said the grenade exploded after hitting a military
vehicle traveling in a joint army-police patrol in Strabane, on the
province's western border.
   Four soldiers were taken to a hospital, but all were released
after treatment.
   An unidentified man later was arrested after three devices
similar to the so-called drogue grenades were found in a nearby
house, police said. Drogue grenades are homemade bombs designed to
penetrate the security forces' armored vehicles.
   In northern Belfast, rival gangs fought street battles with
rocks and gasoline bombs through the early hours, and clashed with
police who moved in to break up the disturbance. Police arrested
two people, but no injuries were reported.
   In the western sector of Belfast, soldiers fired plastic bullets
to disperse an attacking crowd of Irish nationalists, police said.
   The trouble followed an Irish Republican Army bombing Wednesday
night that killed six British soldiers after a charity footrace in
Lisburn, seven miles outside Belfast.
   British and Irish security forces were searching for the IRA
cache of devastating Czechoslovak explosive used in the attack.
   Security officials said the outlawed group used high-powered
Semtex plastic explosive _ made in Czechoslovakia and smuggled from
Libya _ in the 7-pound bomb to blow up the off-duty soldiers in
their military van.
   In London, meanwhile, two men from Northern Ireland were
convicted Friday of plotting an Irish Republican Army bombing
campaign in England.
   Patrick McLaughlin and Liam McCotter are to be sentenced Monday
and could receive terms of up to life in prison.
   They were arrested by agents of the Anti-Terrorist Squad in
February 1987 after nearly 200 pounds of explosives along with
detonators, timing devices, three rifles and ammunition were found.
   McLaughlin, 40, and McCotter, 25, both from Belfast, were found
were with arms caches sufficient for a ``sustained and prolonged''
terror campaign with at least 25 bombs, officials said.
   In the Netherlands, Dutch police stymied by the lack of any
solid lead have given up any hope of finding the IRA killers that
shot and bombed three British servicemen last month.
   In the weeks since the May 1 attacks, hundreds of witnesses were
interviewed, according to Dutch Natioanl Police spokesman Harry
Clabbers.
   ``We plowed our way through just about the whole lot but simply
got nowhere,'' Clabbers told The Associated Press.
   In last month's Dutch attacks, an IRA car bomb exploded under
the car of three Royal Air Force soldiers in the town of Nieuw
Bergen, 43 miles north of here.
   The bomb killed two soldiers and injured the third.
   About an hour later, an IRA gunman opened fire on a car with
three other British servicemen in this southern Dutch city, killing
one and injuring two.
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic to the south.

   Rival West German rowdies clashed
in Munich and English and German fans boozed, brawled, and beat up
motorists in Frankfurt on a second restive night during the
European Championships.
   Police said today more than 180 new arrests were made and
thousands of police were put on alert in Frankfurt.
   In Munich, rival West German rowdies mixed it up, while groups
of English fans in Frankfurt threw beer bottles and glasses in
random vandalism and bar fighting near the main train station.
   Mostly English rowdies in downtown Frankfurt attacked drivers of
two cars at red lights, slightly injuring both and damaging their
vehicles. Sixty-one fans were arrested, police said.
   In Munich, police said 120 West Germans, most of them drunk,
were arrested after brawling between rival groups of fans broke out
late Friday.
   English fans, on a self-proclaimed ``Invasion of Germany 1988,''
have descended on Frankfurt for today's match against the Soviet
Union in the two-week, West German-hosted European Soccer
Championships.
   Police on Friday said the body of a 29-year-old Irish soccer fan
was found floating in the Main River running through Frankfurt.
   There was no immediate indication of foul play in the death,
police said, and the victim apparently drowned while intoxicated.
The body was discovered on Thursday night.
   Soccer-related violence broke out in Munich on Friday, and
police put the blame on rival gangs of West German thugs.
   Munich police arrested 59 rowdies _ most of them West Germans _
for street brawling or for tearing up compartments on two trains
bringing fans to the Bavarian capital for the Friday night West
Germany-Spain soccer match.
   One of those arrested was from England, while most of the others
were West Germans, police said.
   Police in Munich also said 61 others including West German
``Skinheads'' had been rounded up without being charged to prevent
them from causing trouble near the city's train station.
   Small groups of English, West German and Italian rowdies got
into isolated scuffles near Frankfurt's main train station Friday
night, police said. About 200 beer-drinking English fans had been
milling about in the area since Friday afternoon.
   Late Friday night in Frankfurt, police charged at and dispersed
dozens of drunken English soccer fans near the train station,
officials said.
   ``They (the English) came out of a bar looking for trouble and
they got it,'' said Peter Staskiewecz, a Frankfurt police spokesman.
   The yelling and singing English fans were marching down a street
when they encountered the police, he said.
   Staskiewecz said at least three people were arrested in the
confrontation.
   Before dawn on Friday, English troublemakers tore up several
Frankfurt bars and attacked West Germans.
   Violence by English fans already has prompted England to
withdraw its application for readmission to European club soccer
tournaments next season.
   English clubs were banned after the 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy
in which 39 people, most of them Italians, were killed in violence
sparked by rampaging English soccer fans.
   In preparation for today's match, 1,400 officers were put on
alert in Frankfurt, and special squads patrolled the city.
   The expected troubles already have led many Frankfurt tavern
owners to announce they will close early over the weekend.
   ``This is a soccer-free area,'' said a sign taped up in one bar
window by an owner trying to keep drunken fans away.
   This year's soccer championships that started June 10 have led
to some of the most elaborate police and security preparations in
several years in West Germany.
   Nonetheless, the English fans have left behind a string of
arrests in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Cologne and Duesseldorf.
   Before dawn on Friday, roving bands of English soccer rowdies
smashed up bars and brawled with German tavern patrons in
Frankfurt's Sachsenhausen night-life district and near the main
railroad station.
   The English rowdies also overturned cars, hurled beer bottles at
passers-by and smashed store windows, according to police.
   At least 13 English soccer fans and a West German were arrested
during Friday's disturbances, Frankfurt police said.
   Several people were hurt in the Friday clashes in Frankfurt,
including three police officers, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms swirled through North Carolina, Virginia and Iowa
today, dumping much-needed rain on several areas, while another
storm system blasted Wyoming, Nevada and Utah with heavy winds and
large hail.
   In North Carolina, more than 2{ inches of rain fell between
Greensboro and Winston-Salem. At the airport near Greensboro, half
an inch of rain fell in 30 minutes. In Iowa, over an inch of rain
was recorded in Algona, Fort Dodge, and Kanawha.
   In Virginia, thunderstorms in Williamsburg brought 1\ inches of
rain Friday night and flooded some of the low-lying areas.
   Severe thunderstorms in Pulaski County in western Virginia
brought large hail that damaged cars, while wind gusts to over 50
mph knocked down trees.
   Thunderstorms also whipped up strong winds in western states.
Winds gusted to 59 mph in Great Falls, Mont.; to 53 mph at Trenton,
Utah; and to near 50 mph in Cody, Wyo. Further west, winds gusted
to nearly 60 mph at Carlin in northern Nevada.
   Skies were mostly clear this morning from the Great Lakes region
across the middle Mississippi Valley and central Plains to Texas,
as well as over northern Florida and much of California. Dense fog
hovered over portions of New England.
   Today's forecast called for widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Carolinas across the Gulf Coast states,
Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley to southeast Texas, with
most of the storms centered in North Carolina; and widely scattered
thunderstorms in Minnesota and over the mountains of the West, with
most of the storms in northern Arizona, Utah and eastern Nevada.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 70s from New England
across New York into the northern Great Lakes; in the 60s and 70s
over the Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; between
95 and 100 across western portions of the Great Plains; near 105
degrees in the Big Bend area of southwest Texas; between 100 to 110
in the desert Southwest; and in the 80s to mid-90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44 at
Oscoda, Mich., to 94 at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A drought that has dried up crops, pastures and rivers will
continue in the Midwest for at least another month, forecasters
warned, while crews today dredged the shallow Mississippi and Ohio
rivers in hopes of freeing 1,700 stranded barges.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended Friday across parts of Iowa,
Kansas, Arkansas, South Dakota, Montana and the lower Mississippi
Valley, as well as parts of the Southeast and the West.
   But the widely scattered rain had little impact.
   ``The drought continues, basically,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Lyle Alexander said today from Kansas City, Mo. ``The
heart of the Midwest will remain dry, the areas that are most
critical right now.''
   The weather service has predicted a continuation of the dry
weather through at least July 15, with the possibility of a 20
percent to 25 percent loss in corn yields compared with the 10
percent loss suffered to date.
   Northeastern Iowa needs 5 inches of rain to restore normal
growing conditions, and the rest of the state needs between 2 and 4
inches, Iowa State extension climatologist Elwynn Taylor said. Some
areas received up to an inch Friday, but most parts got less than a
quarter-inch, Alexander said.
   Early today, over an inch of rain fell in the north-central Iowa
communities of Algona, Fort Dodge and Kanawha.
   Iowa ordered irrigators and other heavy water users along the
Winnebago, English and Little Cedar rivers and a section of the
Cedar River to stop pumping water, with officials saying similar
bans are being considered to protect other low-flowing streams.
   Minnesota officials also suspended river-fed irrigation by 22
farmers along the Elk River, which has dropped so low that a
landowner reported hearing ``fish at night trying to flop their way
through the river.''
   Responding to the growing crisis, which could lead to higher
food prices, members of a congressional task force on the drought
met Friday with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng in
Washington.
   Lyng has said lawmakers should wait to learn more about the full
extent of the damage before they write legislation to aid farmers.
Six senators planned to tour the sun-scorched wheat lands of
Montana and the Dakotas this weekend.
   USDA officials reiterated that much of the wheat crop in those
states already is severely damaged, but that an inch or so of rain
once a week for the rest of the growing season could save the
Midwest's corn and soybean fields.
   ``Our guess is, right now if we got rain in the next eight days
yields for corn and soybeans would be off by 20 percent,'' Indiana
Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz said Friday on a visit to a dairy farm north
of Evansville.
   ``If we don't get rain and we get into the dry season, yields
could be off 40 to 50 percent,'' he said.
   Hundreds of barges sat idle Friday on the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers due to low water levels. Officials said Sunday would be the
earliest that safe travel could resume.
   The Mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in 1872.
   About 1,000 barges were halted on the Mississippi near
Greenville, Miss., waiting for dredges to clear a channel, while
nearly 700 barges were stuck on the Ohio awaiting dredging near
Mound City, Ill., authorities said, adding that tow boat owners
were losing about $10,000 a day.
   Dredging crews worked around the clock to dig channels for the
barges, which carried grain, chemicals, coal and oil.
   In Kentucky, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson declared a statewide
water-shortage watch Friday, urging all citizens to voluntarily
conserve water. It was believed to be the first such watch ever
issued by a Kentucky governor.
   Residents of Chillicothe in northwest Missouri planned to take
to the streets Sunday to perform a rain dance in an attempt to
spare area crops from the drought. But the weather service offered
little encouragement.
   ``I would rule out any rain on Sunday,'' said meteorologist Ed
Ferguson, also in Kansas City. ``Let's hope I'm wrong. I'd love to
join in.''

<HEAD>British-Israeli Relations Suffer Over Secret Agent</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Britain-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's expulsion of an Israeli diplomat has
put another crease in British-Israeli relations already torn by the
controversy over Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu.
   The current rift came over revelations that Israel's Mossad
secret service mounted a covert intelligence operation in England
using a Palestinian double agent. British prosecutors said he spied
on another Palestinian wanted in connection with terrorist acts.
   The Mossad carried out the operation without informing British
authorities of its activities or that the wanted man, Abder Rahmane
Mustafa, was living in Britain.
   The British foreign office announced Friday it was expelling
Israeli diplomat Arie Regev ``because of activities incompatible
with his diplomatic duties.'' It gave no further explanation.
   Britain also expelled Zaki Al Hawa, a press officer at the
Palestine Liberation Organization's London office, also without
providing a reason.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing ``regret
that Her Majesty's government has seen fit to take the measure of
expelling an Israeli diplomat. Israel did not act against any
British interests.''
   Two years ago, British officials were angered over the
disappearance from London of Vanunu, a former technician at
Israel's nuclear plant in the southern town of Dimona. Vanunu, who
has since been convicted in Israel of espionage and treason,
provided the information for a three-page report by the Sunday
Times of London on the Jewish state's nuclear arsenal.
   Although Israel has never officially admitted it, reports
indicate that the Mossad was responsible for Vananu's disappearance
and subsequent abduction to Israel. He was reportedly lured to Rome
by a woman employed by the Mossad, then drugged and flown to Israel.
   The latest disclosures about the Mossad were made during the
trial of the double-agent, Ismail Hassan Sowan, sentenced Thursday
to 11 years in prison for possessing explosives and firearms.
   Sowan kept the weapons for Mustapha, who is suspected of
involvement in a series of terrorist actions, including the killing
in London of Arab cartoonist Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami. The Times of
London said an international arrest warrant had been issued for
Mustapha.
   The current furor is the latest in relations between Israel and
Britain, which have been turbulent since even before the founding
of Israel.
   Jewish underground groups forces forced Britain, then the U.N.
mandatory power, to leave Palestine. Britain abstained in the U.N.
vote which led to Israel's establishment in 1948 and trained
Jordan's army, which fought Israel during the 1948 Middle East War.
   Relations warmed in the 1950s. In 1956, Israel, France and
Britain formed an alliance to attack Egypt, after then-President
Gamel Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal.
   Britain imposed an arms embargo on Israel at the outbreak of the
1967 Middle East War.
   Relations had again warmed over the past few years because of
the reportedly close ties between Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded today in this capital
of an ethnically troubled province near the Austrian border. The
blasts broke windows but injured no one, police said.
   The blasts came the day after Parliament gave final approval to
a new agreement granting more autonomy and other benefits to the
German-speaking residents of Alto Adige, or South Tyrol, in
northern Italy. The region was part of Austria until the end of
World War I.
   Police said the first bomb exploded before dawn in front of the
courthouse, and the second a few minutes later on a street in an
Italian-speaking neighborhood. Authorities said both were hidden in
trash cans.
   On May 17, four bombs exploded in this city before a meeting in
Vienna where Austria approved the agreement. There were no
casualties from those explosions.
   Police blamed them on German-speaking extremists who want
self-determination for the region. There was no immediate word on
who may have planted the bombs that went off today, though police
noted that one bomb went off in the Italian-speaking area.
   Austria has long championed rights of German-speaking residents
in the area. Terrorist attacks in the 1960s led to an agreement
between Italy and Austria establishing the rights and privileges of
ethnic groups.

   Murder charges could be filed against Stella
Nickell, who was sentenced to 90 years in prison for the
``exceptional callousness and cruelty'' of putting cyanide in
pain-relief capsules that killed her husband and a stranger two
years ago.
   King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said he had waited until the
sentencing Friday to start a review of whether state murder charges
would be filed against Mrs. Nickell.
   Maleng said state laws against double jeopardy are stricter than
the U.S. Constitution's protection, but it was possible the state
murder law and federal anti-product tampering statute differ enough
to allow prosecution.
   At the sentencing, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer harshly
criticized Mrs. Nickell for the severity of her crimes.
   ``The jury has found the defendant guilty of appalling crimes,''
said Dwyer, who recommended Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn
not be eligible for parole for at least 30 years.
   It will not be the first time behind bars for Mrs. Nickell. She
spent six months in jail after she violated probation in Orange
County, Calif., on a 1971 conviction for check fraud.
   Then known as Stella Strong, she also was convicted of child
beating in Southern California in 1969. It could not be determined
immediately what sentence she received.
   The victim of the beating was her daughter, Cindy Hamilton, now
28, who was the key witness in Mrs. Nickell's product-tampering
trial.
   Mrs. Nickell, the first person brought to trial under a federal
law dealing with death by product tampering, appeared pale and
unsmiling Friday, but did not otherwise respond when Dwyer
sentenced her. She made no statement in court.
   Her attorney, Thomas Hillier, told Dwyer she maintains her
innocence and would appeal her conviction.
   ``It must be said that these are crimes of exceptional
callousness and cruelty,'' Dwyer said, noting that poisoned
capsules had been left on store shelves and could easily have lead
to other deaths.
   Mrs. Nickell, convicted May 9, received 90-year terms on each of
two counts of product tampering, which killed her husband, Bruce
Nickell, and Susan Katherine Snow, also of Auburn.
   She also was sentenced to 10-year terms on each of three
tampering counts for poisoning bottles of Extra-Strength Excedrin
and Anacin found in the Nickell home and on the shelves of area
stores.
   All terms were to run concurrently. In addition, Dwyer levied a
mandatory $250 minimum fine and said any of Mrs. Nickell's assets
should be used to compensate her victims, especially Mrs. Snow's
family.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida, the prosecutor in the
case, said Mrs. Nickell was indigent and the compensation issue was
``academic.''
   Prosecutors had requested a 230-year sentence, with a minimum 67
years before parole eligibility, saying entire families could have
died because of the tampering.
   Prosecutors alleged Mrs. Nickell killed her husband because she
was tired of him and wanted to collect $176,000 in life insurance.
They said Mrs. Snow, who had no connection with the couple, was an
innocent victim of a plot to make Nickell's death appear the work
of a random killer.
   The deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and caused
Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers Co. to recall its
non-prescription capsule medicines.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are proposing new
regulations that would impose fines and other penalties on
hospitals that turn away emergency room patients for fear they
can't afford to pay.
   A letter sent to hospital administrators states that when a
patient comes to an emergency room, the hospital must offer
``appropriate medical screening examinations to all individuals
with emergency medical conditions and all women in active labor.''
   ``They may either stabilize the condition or provide a medically
appropriate transfer to another facility when indicated, unless the
patient or their legal representative refuses treatment or
transfer,'' it says.
   The letter was sent by Health and Humans Services Inspector
General Richard P. Kusserow, Medicare administrator William L.
Roper and Office for Civil Rights Director Audrey F. Morton.
   The proposed new rules were published this week in the Federal
Register and will become law after a period of public comment.
   The letter warns that violating the law by refusing to accept
emergency room patients can result in penalties of up to $50,000,
civil lawsuits under state laws, and suspension or exclusion from
the Medicare program.
   The rules cover all patients, not just those on Medicare.
   Congress enacted legislation in 1986 to guard against instances
in which hospitals were turning away women in labor and other
patients in need of immediate care because they did not have money
or insurance to pay for medical services.

<HEAD>Costa Rican Fishermen Arrive on Land After Five Months Adrift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Costa Rican fishermen kept from going crazy
during five months adrift in a 30-foot boat by fishing, praying and
remembering their families back home, one of them says.
   ``We tried to keep ourselves busy, and that helped a lot,''
Gerardo Obregon Obando, captain of the fishing boat Cairo III, said
Friday. ``We were grateful no one took a knife and tried to kill
somebody.''
   ``We fished, we prayed, we put our faith in God. We never gave
up hope.''
   A Japanese tuna boat spotted Obando and his crew 700 miles
southeast of here Wednesday and brought them to Oahu on Friday.
Obando said the Cairo III set out Jan. 19 from Puntarenas, Costa
Rica, for an eight-day fishing trip, but was driven from land by a
storm and ran out of gas before it could reach port.
   The boat and its crew drifted 3,600 miles across the Pacific
Ocean, according to Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Crawley.
   Obando, 33, the only crewman who agreed to be interviewed, said
the five collected rainwater and caught enough food to stay healthy.
   ``We lived on sharks, fish _ even little fish _ and whatever
else got near the boat,'' Obando said through an interpreter. ``We
had containers which we had ready all the time to catch rainwater.''
   Dr. Martha Hauk of the Coast Guard, who examined the men before
they left the Kinei Maru 128, said she was surprised to find them
in near-perfect health.
   ``They just look so good it's amazing,'' she said.
   Doctors at Tripler Army Medical Center also examined the men and
said the five were in good shape and none would be hospitalized,
said hospital spokesman George Vidis. Two of them were treated for
mild dehydration and one was treated for an abscessed tooth, he
said.
   Obando said the storm struck Jan. 24 while the boat was three or
four hours from shore.
   The storm, which Obando said lasted more than two weeks, knocked
out the Cairo III's radio and the vessel's motor failed in rough
seas. The boat ran out of fuel while trying to reach land after the
storm broke.
   Supplies ran out after eight days at sea, Obando said. They
never went hungry, but they went one or two days without water.
``We were so thirsty we were licking the sides of the containers,''
he said.
   The crew fashioned a small, makeshift sail that helped them move
with the current, Obando said.
   Hilda Richardson, the Costa Rican consul in Hawaii, said the men
would spend tonight in a hotel and probably be flown home Sunday.
   Mrs. Richardson said she had informed families in Costa Rica
that the fishermen had been found. She said the man hadn't been
able to speak with their families Friday, but probably would be
able to telephone them before leaving Honolulu.
   Tatsuo Oyama, captain of the Kinei Maru 128, said a lookout
spotted the Cairo III with the men waving on its deck. The men were
rescued, but the boat was left adrift.
   The fishermen were identified as Obando, George Fernandez
Castillo, 22, Pastor Lopez Rojas, 30, Joel Omar Gonzalez, 27, and
Juan Cernas Bolivar, 47.
   Obando said he and his crew, all from Puntarenas, would return
to fishing but first would spend time with their families.

   Uniform steel tests could prevent fractures in
thousands of aging oil storage tanks from causing spills similar to
one in Pennsylvania this year that contaminated the water supply in
three states, a government report said.
   ``The absence of steel toughness standards until 1963 and the
failure to comply with today's standards when rebuilding tanks
means that thousands of tanks in existence today could be
susceptible to a brittle fracture like this one,'' Rep. Doug
Walgren, D-Pa., said Friday.
   Walgren requested the investigation by the Commerce Department's
National Bureau of Standards after the Jan. 2 collapse of an
Ashland Petroleum Co. tank near Pittsburgh.
   The Ashland tank split open as it was being filled with 3.8
million gallons of oil, pouring an estimated 713,000 gallons into
the Monongahela and Ohio rivers. The spill forced communities in
Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to close their drinking water
intakes, leaving about 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents without
tap water for almost a week.
   The report confirmed Ashland's statements earlier this year that
the spill resulted from a dime-sized flaw in the nearly 50-year-old
steel wall of the 4-million-gallon container. The wall was
assembled in 1940, dismantled and reconstructed at the company's
Floreffe Terminal south of Pittsburgh in 1986, the company noted.
   Walgren said Ashland Oil, by using old steel in reconstructing
the tank, avoided industry standards in effect when the storage
facility was erected in 1986.
   ``The report demonstrates that we must not only question the
safety of most tanks in the United States, but we must also develop
new testing techniques to assess the quality of existing tanks,''
he said.
   If the steel is tough enough, the report said, ``normal
spill-control measures will confine the spread of the contents, and
the tank can be repaired _ all without catastrophic consequences.''
   The Ashland tank did not meet current, nationally recognized
standards for fracture toughness and the welds in the tanks, while
not contributing to the split, did not conform to current standards
and only served to make the metal around the flaw more brittle, the
report said.
   Safety concerns regarding the older tanks currently in use can
be alleviated if there is documentation indicating the steel meets
``sufficient toughness provisions,'' the report said.
   For those tanks lacking ``sufficient toughness,'' the bureau
suggested remedial actions, including installing special crack
``arresters,'' converting the tank to a higher temperature use or
retiring the tank.
   The report also stressed the need for standard testing and
evaluation procedures to assess the fracture safety of tanks made
from inadequately documented steel.

<HEAD>Murdoch Executive Says Remarks About Network's Closure Taken Out
Of Context</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finance director of Rupert Murdoch's
media empire says his statement that the company would shut down
the Fox television network if it continues to lose money was taken
out of context.
   News Corp. executive Richard Sarazen said Thursday at a meeting
of securities analysts in New York that Fox was losing $80 million
annually.
   ``If it doesn't improve dramatically in the next six months,
we'll close it down,'' the financial newspaper Investor's Daily
quoted Sarazen as saying.
   On Friday, Sarazen said his remarks had been taken out of
context and no timetable for success has been delivered to Fox
executives, according to a statement given to Los Angeles Fox
affiliate KTTV by Brad Turrel, vice president of publicity for Fox
Broadcasting Corp.
   Billed as the nation's ``fourth network,'' Fox was created in
1986 to compete with NBC, ABC, and CBS.
   Its Sunday lineup, including ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' and
``It's Gary Shandling's Show,'' has been doing relatively well in
the ratings, but Saturday night's programs have lagged behind.
   According to Sarazen, assurances that Saturday night ratings
would climb have cost the network money as advertisers receive free
rebroadcasts of commercials to reach promised audience numbers.
   Sarazen said News Corp. expected to lose about $50 million a
year in starting the venture, the report said. Fox has 125
affiliate stations.
   The executive said the company would hold onto the Fox
television stations regardless of what happens to the network. He
said News Corp. would consider turning the network into a
syndicator of programming, focusing largely on reruns of shows with
a smattering of original movies or series.

   The first of 6,000 people evacuated
from neighborhoods choked by a chlorine gas cloud began returning
to their homes today after a chemical fire at a supply plant was
brought under control.
   At least 125 people were treated overnight for injuries from the
gas cloud, but none was admitted, hospital supervisors said. In
addition, 13 firefighters were treated and released for exposure to
fumes or chemical burns.
   Two high schools and a hospital were turned into shelters for
the evacuees, among them scores of nursing home residents and some
800 Methodists attending an annual weekend meeting at Springfield
College, Fire Department spokesman Giorgio Placanico said.
   ``I don't really believe it happened, even though I'm trained as
a chemist and know the dangers of chlorine,'' said Elizabeth Lurie,
55, of Leominster, as she waited to return to the dormitory room
she left just before midnight Friday.
   Fire officials said the gas cloud was still hanging over a small
section of the evacuated area today and it would be hours before
some residents could return to their homes. The fire was brought
under control at 3:15 a.m.
   Police wearing gas masks patrolled the area.
   The fire that spawned the chlorine gas cloud was one of two at
the three-story Advanced Laboratories plant Friday.
   Investigators believed the two fires were unrelated, but arson
has not been ruled out, Fire Commissioner Anthony Pellegrino said.
   A police cruiser making a routine drive through the area
reported the fire about 11 p.m., Placanico said.
   At least 100 firefighters, some wearing oxygen tanks and gas
masks, worked to extinguish the blaze.
   People were evacuated in buses from neighborhoods near the fire.
About half of those evacuated went to the three shelters, while the
others fled to the homes of relatives or friends.
   The cloud of chlorine gas had a radius of at least a half mile,
officials said.
   The first fire began shortly after 10 a.m., when rain from an
early morning thunderstorm apparently blew through an open window
onto chlorine dust and into a chlorine hopper at the plant,
sparking a chemical reaction, Sullivan said.
   Firefighters using soda ash quickly extinguished the flames, but
as the fumes began to spread in the hot, muggy air, authorities
evacuated all homes, businesses and schools within a quarter mile
of the plant as a precautionary measure, he said. Residents were
allowed to return two hours later, before being evacuated again
Friday night.

   A gunman shot and slightly wounded Premier
Turgut Ozal in the right hand as the leader addressed delegates at
his party's convention. At least 20 others were injured.
   The gunman was hit in the arm by return fire from Ozal's
bodyguards and then arrested. Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said
16 other people were wounded by gunfire and four were trampled in
the panic after the attack.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengiz Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
through Ozal's right thumb and exited from the palm. The wound
required three stitches and the premier was in good condition, he
said.
   State television showed a picture of the gunmen at a hospital
and asked anyone who knew him to come forward and identify him to
police.
   The wounded include Labor Minister Imren Aykut, who suffered
scratches on her face, and one Motherland Party member of
Parliament, Beduk said. Two of the wounded required surgery but
were in satisfactory condition, he said.
   It was not immediately clear if the gunfire that hit some of the
wounded came from police or the gunman.
   A police official at the scene, who requested anonymity, said
the first bullet fired by the gunman hit the microphone in front of
Ozal and the second one hit his right thumb.
   Ozal took cover immediately behind the lectern when he heard the
shots, Anatolia said. Delegates and others inside the Ataturk
convention hall also took cover, it said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli said the captured gunman gave
two different names to police and was insisting he acted alone. He
said the gunman first said his name was Hayati Ipek, then changed
this to Kartal, which means eagle in Turkish.
   Despite his injury, Ozal returned to the floor to continue his
speech.
   ``No one can take away the life given by God except God
himself,'' Ozal said.
   The delegates gave him a long standing ovation after this
statement.
   The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, but their
identities were not released.
   Later today, the delegates were expected to re-elect Ozal as
party chairman. There were no other candidates running against him.
   Ozal returned Wednesday from a historic three-day vist to
Greece, the first Turkish premier to visit its traditionally
hostile neighbor in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from his talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they wanted to continue their dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus.
   Cyprus has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot sectors since Turkey invaded in 1974 after an
Athens-inspired coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   In March 1987, Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war over
oil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed.
   On Thursday, a court sentenced a Greek chemist to four months in
jail for throwing a tomato at Ozal's car on the last day of his
visit to Greece. The chemist said he was angry about Ozal's visit.
   In today's speech to the delegates, Ozal emphasized the
importance of political stability, saying the last decade, marred
by terrorism and an economic crisis, was a lost decade for Turkey.
   Ozal defended his record and recent economic austerity measures.
He said he was not interested in short-term designs and was looking
ahead to the year 2000.
   He was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The 61-year-old premier conceded that Turkey suffers from 75
percent inflation but pledged to halve the inflation rate within a
year.

   Former Defense Minister V.P. Singh
boosted his chances of opposing Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in
national elections by taking a commanding lead today in a
parliamentary election.
   With 70.5 percent of the ballots counted from Thursday's special
election in the Allahabad district, Singh had 54 percent to 24
percent for his nearest challenger, singer and film writer Sunil
Shastri.
   Shastri, son of the late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, was
the candidate of Gandhi's Congress Party. Singh ran as an
independent with the backing of several opposition parties.
   By early evening today, the 56-year-old Singh had 163,058 of the
300,000 votes counted. Shastri, 38, had 71,868. The rest were
divided among 66 other candidates.
   Gandhi was quoted by Indian news agency reporters as saying that
the election results were not unexpected.
   ``The ruling party gets it in its neck'' in off-year elections,
Gandhi was quoted as saying. ``The Congress is satisfied over the
outcome of the polls as it has come at a difficult time.''
   About 850,000 people were eligible to vote, but election workers
estimated only about 50 percent turned out.
   The Allahabad contest was one of seven special parliamentary
elections conducted Thursday. By this morning, the Congress Party
had captured one seat and opposition parties had two.
   Votes were still being counted in three other constituencies,
including Allahabad. In the seventh district, in Haryana state, the
count has not begun because of reports of ballot-stuffing.
   In state legislative elections also conducted Thursday, the
Congress Party took five seats and opposition parties won five.
Vote-counting was stayed in an 11th contest in Haryana state
because of the ballot-stuffing charges.
   The contest in Allahabad, 360 miles southeast of New Delhi,
provided the first voter test of Singh's ability to oppose Prime
Minister Gandhi for the leadership of the nation.
   Under its constitution, India must conduct national elections no
later than January 1990.
   Singh, who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, was a
member of Gandhi's Congress Party until last summer when he broke
with the prime minister and quit the Cabinet over the government's
hesitation to investigate corruption.
   As defense minister, Singh wanted to look into allegations that
kickbacks were paid to purchase Bofors artillery guns from Sweden
and submarines from West Germany.
   According to Indian press reports, the kickbacks were paid to
government officials and friends of Gandhi. Gandhi himself was
never accused of wrongdoing, and a parliamentary report later said
it had uncovered no irregularities.

   Authorities began house-to-house searches
and stepped up checkpoints on roadways today after three of eight
escapees from the Kentucky State Penitentiary were captured near
the maximum-security prison.
   Leo Spurling, 30, and Floyd Cook, 35, were apprehended about
7:30 a.m. today near Eddyville, about two mines north of the
penitentiary, prison spokesman Don Sapienza said.
   Robert G. Sherman, 30, was captured Friday afternoon in the same
area.
   Spurling, a convicted murderer, and Cook, a convicted rapist,
were captured after authorities on foot and in cars, boats and
airplanes searched the area.
   Meanwhile, a prosecutor who sent one of the men to prison for
murder was given extra protection, and authorities reported they
found a broken hacksaw blade in a prison toilet.
   Sherman, in handcuffs, greeted prison officials upon his return
with a broad smile. He was wearing dirty black sweatpants and gray
socks but no shirt, and his heavily tatooed back was full of
scratches. A prison guard carried Sherman's boots.
   Sherman was serving 15 years for robbery, escape, wanton
endangerment and promoting contraband.
   The warden said Sherman appeared embarrassed when told he was
the first escapee caught.
   Probation and parole officers in the escapees' hometowns were
asked to check with inmates' families, relatives and acquaintances
to see if they knew of their whereabouts, Seabold said.
   Prison spokesman Barry Banister said that until confirmed
sightings were received, authorities were operating on the premise
that the escapees were still in the vicinity of the prison.
   The eight prisoners escaped early Thursday morning after they
sawed through cell doors and a barred window. Prison guards were
diverted by a fire that had been set on the floor below. The
prisoners were housed in isolation cells reserved for the
penitentiary's troublemakers.
   Prison spokesman Bobby Waller said the window almost certainly
had been broken for some time to allow prisoners access to the
outer bars. Prison officials were investigating why guards had not
reported the broken window earlier, Waller said.
   The century-old prison remained under a lockdown Friday, with
the other 770 prisoners allowed out of their cells only for meals.
   Reporters on Friday were given their first look at the No. 3
cellhouse, from which the prisoners escaped.
   Seventeen of the 160 cell doors were disabled in the escape,
said Jerry Merrick, the prison's chief engineer.
   Authorities found a 2- to 3-inch piece of a hacksaw in one of
the escapee's toilets Thursday, and an attempt had been made to
flush it, Waller said.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that they used a hacksaw blade in
order to cut out,'' Waller said Friday.
   Meanwhile, ``extra security measures'' were put into effect for
Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney Ernest Jasmin, said his
first assistant, John W. Stewart. He declined to detail the
measures, and said they were ``nothing to suggest we're afraid, but
better safe than sorry.''
   Jasmin prosecuted Leo C. Spurling, one of four convicted murders
among the escapees. He received a life sentence.

   Catholics in central Vietnam have been
told not to celebrate the Vatican's canonization Sunday of
Vietnamese martyrs, which Hanoi has condemned as politically
motivated, Vietnam's official Radio Hanoi said.
   Pope John Paul II is to preside over the canonization of 117
martyrs, the largest in church history, at St. Peter's Basilica in
the Vatican. Thousands of Vietnamese, many of whom fled their
communist homeland, are expected to attend and Hanoi fears it will
become a widely publicized anti-communist rally.
   The radio said Thursday that Bishop Huynh Dong Cat of Qui Nhon
diocese in central Nghia Binh province sent a June 11 letter to
priests and lay followers instructing them not to mark the occasion.
   It said Cat wrote the letter a day after the the provincial
people's committee, or government, ``invited'' him for a meeting
and outlined the official stand on the issue.
   A text of the broadcast was obtained from a Western embassy in
Bangkok today.
   The broadcast said the letter noted that Sunday also is the day
the government of South Vietnam had celebrated its army. Communists
defeated the South Vietnam government in April 1975 and reunified
Vietnam.
   The Vatican has said the timing of the ceremony is coincidental.
   The letter continued: ``On that day, you brothers and sisters
can go to churches as usual. However, you should not organize
canonization masses, hoist banners, make decorations and hold
meetings or engage in any illegal activities at your churches that
could be exploited by bad elements to disrupt public order and
security.''
   Refugees and others said that since 1975, Vietnam has closed
seminaries and taken other steps to systematically repress
Catholicism in the largely Buddhist nation. But new Vietnamese
leadership has taken steps over the past two years to allow more
religious freedom.

   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be

   The official said the president also praised Ozal for his

   Reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appeared on
Iranian television Saturday, two days after reports surfaced that
the 87-year-old Iranian leader was dead.
   Khomeini was shown at a meeting of volunteer guards at the
Jamaran mosque, near his home in northern Tehran.
   The television report showed Khomeini sitting to one side of a
podium as Ali Mohammed Rahmani, head of the volunteer guards,
discussed the United States' impending $1.9 billion arms sale to
Kuwait and other issues.
   At the end of the meeting, Khomeini got slowly out of his chair
and lifted his right hand to acknowledge the cheers of the guards.
He did not speak and appeared weak, but he moved without
assistance. The broadcast was monitored in Nicosia.
   A British television station reported Thursday that an exiled
Iranian writer in Paris thought Khomeini was dead because of
unusual movements of officials in Tehran and because international
phone lines had been shut off.
   Oil prices jumped sharply on New York financial markets in late
trading Thursday in response to rumors that Khomeini had died.
   The Iranian embassy in Paris immediately denied the report.
Khomeini's rare appearance Saturday, also reported by Tehran Radio,
apparently was organized to undermine the rumors.
   A spokesman for the Iranian resistance, in a telephone interview
from Washington, said the Iranian government had orchestrated the
rumors of Khomeini's death to distract people from Iran's recent
setbacks in the nearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.

   An escaped convict shot and wounded
Premier Turgut Ozal on Saturday, police said, moments after Ozal
urged his country to reject violence. Twenty-one people, including
the gunman, were injured when police opened fire and the crowd
stampeded.
   Ozal, 61, was shot in the right hand and slightly wounded as he
gave the opening speech at the convention of his governing
Motherland Party.
   ``We have a more civilized atmosphere now. People of different
views can now talk to each other instead of fighting or drawing
their guns,'' Ozal said before the first shot struck the
microphone. A second bullet hit Ozal.
   Police fired at the assailant and hit him in the arm.
   Scores of people ran screaming as shots rang out. Sixteen
suffered bullet wounds, and four were bruised in the stampede.
   Prosecutor Cemal Ozer, who interviewed the gunman in a hospital,
identified him as Kartal Demirag, 32, and said he escaped from the
Mugla prison in western Turkey six months ago.
   Ankara governor Saffet Arikan Beduk said Demirag had just begun
serving a 10-year sentence for attempted murder when he fled the
low-security prison.
   Earlier, The Associated Press erroneously quoted Ozer as saying
Demirag was serving time for murder.
   Authorities had not established a motive for the attack, Ozer
said.
   Turkish news agencies reported responsibility claims from the
outlawed Kurdish Labor Party and another group called The
Revolutionary Officers Organization.
   None of the claims could be confirmed independently.
   The Kurdish Labor Party is fighting for an independent Marxist
state in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey. About one-fifth
of Turkey's 52 million people are ethnic Kurds.
   The assassination attempt occurred three days after Ozal
returned from a historic visit to Greece, Turkey's longtime enemy.
   Police said Demirag, a schoolteacher, stayed in a hotel near the
convention hall under the name of Hayati Ipek on Friday night.
Beduk said police were investigating Demirag's possible political
affiliations.
   Police took into custody about 50 people, many of whom helped
decorate the convention hall, to determine whether any smuggled
Demirag's weapon into the building, Turkish news agencies reported.
   Police and witnesses said Demirag was standing a few yards from
the lectern in a group of news photographers when he fired. Beduk
said Demirag's gun jammed after he shot twice at Ozal.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli, a physician, quickly wrapped
a white cloth around Ozal's wound.
   As blood seeped through the bandage, Ozal returned to the
lectern and declared, ``No one can take away the life given by God
except God himself!''
   The crowd jumped to its feet and applauded.
   Ozal ducked behind the lectern when he heard the shots, the
Anatolia news agency said.
   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at
him twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told the
agency.
   Ozal's doctor, Cengis Aslan, told reporters a bullet entered
Ozal's hand through the right thumb and exited from the palm.
   The premier received three stitches and returned to the
convention hall three hours after the 12:15 p.m. attack. Later,
delegates re-elected Ozal chairman of the party. There were no
other candidates.
   Ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The Motherland Party was founded six months before elections in
November 1983 that restored civilian rule in Turkey.
   In general elections seven months ago, Ozal's party received 290
of the seats in the 450-seat legislature.
   But in recent months, Ozal's popularity waned because of
inflation, which is running at 75 percent. Recent public opinion
polls have showed support for him at 25 percent, down from the 36
percent of votes he received in the elections.
   In his speech Saturday, Ozal defended austerity measures put in
place to battle inflation. He pledged to cut inflation in half
within a year.
   The attack on Ozal came minutes after he stressed the importance
of political stability. He said that the last 10 years _ in which
political terrorism claimed 5,000 lives and prompted military
intervention in 1980 _ were a lost decade for Turkey.
   Beduk said that of the 16 bystanders wounded by gunfire, two
required surgery but were in satisfactory condition. Police didn't
say if they were hit by police gunfire.
   Ozal returned to Turkey on Wednesday from a three-day visit to
Greece, the first by a Turkish premier in 36 years.
   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emerged
from the talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but both
leaders said they were resolved to continue the dialogue.
   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, including
the Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus. In March 1987, Greece and
Turkey came to the brink of war over oil-drilling rights in the
Aegean seabed.
   One of the first messages of regret about Saturday's attack came
from Papandreou. In a telegram, the Greek leader said, ``I hope you
will continue your government's creative work and the no-war course
we initiated in our countries' bilateral relations with new energy
and health.''
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who is to pay a state visit
to Turkey next month, expressed ``deep shock'' at the attempt on
Ozal's life.
   ``Your calmness and fortitude in continuing your speech to the
Motherland Party congress was admirable,'' Gandhi said in a
statement issued in New Delhi.

   City officials are investigating why it took
paramedics at least 40 minutes to reach a man who collapsed, and
later died, after an endurance test for would-be firefighters.
   The grueling test, which was to have been taken by 28,000 people
seeking jobs as firefighters, has been halted indefinitely while
officials try to determine what caused Freddy Padilla to die and
seven others to become ill.
   Padilla, 24, collapsed June 11 after completing the seven-minute
test; he died seven hours after arriving at St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Medical Center. It was unclear whether a faster response by the
Emergency Medical Service might have saved his life.
   According to Magda Gandasegui, a spokeswoman for the city
Personnel Department, Padilla finished the test about 12:30 p.m. He
apparently reported feeling ill and was looked at by a fire
lieutenant, trained as an emergency medical technician, who took
his pulse and checked his breathing, she said.
   Records show that the lieutenant called EMS at 12:40 p.m. and
asked for an ambulance, according to EMS spokeswoman Donna Osso.
She said a crew arrived at 12:53 p.m. but told the EMS dispatcher
that it could not find the patient; the assignment was canceled as
unfounded.
   The record also shows that at 1:07 p.m. the lieutenant called
EMS again to ask where the ambulance was, Ms. Osso said. This time
the lieutenant told the EMS commander to send the ambulance to an
entrance to the building on West 58th Street and to ``use the
elevator entrance.''
   The EMS commander relayed the message to the EMS dispatcher, but
did not mention the elevator entrance. The dispatcher sent the same
crew.
   At 1:20 p.m., Ms. Osso said, the ambulance crew called the
dispatcher to say that they still could not find the patient.
   Sometime after that, the crew reached Padilla, who was conscious
and talking when they arrived, she said, adding there was no record
of exactly when the crew found him.
   Twenty minutes after the crew reached him, Padilla was taken to
the hospital, where he died shortly before 9 p.m., according to
Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner.
   Autopsy results were inconclusive and further tests were needed
to determine the cause of death, Ms. Borakove said.
   The other seven firefighter candidates who became ill after the
test were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt, where three were admitted
and two remained hospitalized in good condition Saturday, according
to hospital spokeswoman Judy Murphy.
   Ms. Murphy said the patients were treated for mild-to-moderate
kidney disorders, caused by physical exertion.
   The department began testing May 31 and was scheduled to finish
in July. More than 5,000 candidates have finished the test, Ms.
Gandasegui said.
   Candidates are required to sign a statement certifying that they
are in good physical condition, but are not required to have a
physical exam before taking the test.
   During the test, would-be firefighters, wearing 40 pounds of
gear, scale walls, carry a 145-pound dummy, break down a door and
drag 57 pounds of hose.
   ``It is not unusual for people to feel wobbly or vomit after
taking the test,'' Ms. Gandasegui said.

   Israeli troops opened fire Saturday at
protesters throwing firebombs in the occupied Gaza Strip and killed
a 17-year-old Palestinian and wounded two other Arabs.
   In the West Bank, seven Palestinians with gunshot wounds _
including a 16-year-old boy _ were admitted to Al Ittihad Hospital
in the town of Nablus, a hospital official said.
   He told The Associated Press the Palestinians were wounded
Saturday when Israeli troops shot at them during clashes in Nablus
and the nearby village of Burka. The boy, a resident of the Balata
refugee camp, was hit in the lungs and listed in critical
condition, the official said. He gave no other details.
   Saturday's unrest came after the pro-Iranian fundamentalist
group, Islamic Jihad, called on Palestinians to strike and hold
demonstrations to mark the hanging of three Arabs on June 18, 1930.
   The three were hanged by British authorities, who controlled
what was then known as Palestine. They were accused of involvement
in the massacre of a group of Jews near the Wailing Wall in
Jerusalem.
   In the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians
burned tires and attacked Israeli troops with rocks and firebombs,
an Arab reporter and Israeli radio said.
   A military spokesman said the troops opened fire, killing
17-year-old Khaled Al Haj Yussuf with a shot to the chest. Two
other Arabs were wounded, he said.
   The death brought to 210 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab uprising broke out on Dec. 8. Two Israelis _ a soldier and
a teen-age girl _ have died in the violence.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police arrested 19 Palestinians after
the protesters took over two main streets in the commercial
district, pelting Israeli vehicles with rocks, burning tires and
smashing the windows of a police van, police spokesman Rafi Levy
said. The violence was the first in Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods
in four months.
   Protesters also threw rocks at an army lookout post atop the
Damascus Gate, one of the northern entrances to the old, walled
city.
   A senior city official told the AP the riot was organized by
Palestinian agitators from the Gaza Strip as a part of the Islamic
Jihad's memorial day protest.
   Jerusalem was rocked by widespread demonstrations in January and
February.
   Saturday's firebombings were the latest in a mounting series of
such attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.
   The army has initiated a series of measures to curb the attacks:
   _Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin gave soldiers and civilians
permission to shoot on sight at firebomb-throwers.
   _Last week, a military court sentenced to 10 years in jail a
Palestinian convicted of throwing a firebomb at Israeli soldiers.
   _On Thursday and Friday, the army demolished the homes of seven
alleged firebomb throwers.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of Israeli forces in the West
Bank, told Israel radio the firebomb attacks presented a
``complicated problem with no simple or immediate solution because
any child can prepare a firebomb with very primitive means that can
easily be found in the home.''
   He warned that Palestinians may escalate their rebellion by
resorting to firearms and explosives in the next phase of the
uprising.

   Marketing seeds planted by Florists' Transworld
Delivery Association during the last five years are beginning to
bloom with an increasing number of men getting flowers for Father's
Day.
   ``It's not that unusual these days to have people coming in the
store to buy flowers for Father's Day, whereas a couple of years
ago I might have lifted an eyebrow if someone asked about flowers
for dad,'' said John Adamo of Conner Park Florists in Detroit.
   Over the past five years, flowers-by-wire orders for Father's
Day have more than doubled from about 25,200 to 55,200, said Henry
Knitter, group director of corporate services for FTD, based at
Southfield, Mich.
   The association has spent approximately $100 million on
advertising since 1983, 20 percent of that promoting the idea of
giving flowers to men, Knitter said.
   FTD says commercials featuring Merlin Olsen, a former pro
football player turned actor, are part of the reason for the rise
in popularity of flowers on Father's Day. Olsen has been the FTD
spokesman since 1983.
   ``He (Olsen) has a macho image, yet also comes across as a
gentle giant,'' Knitter said.
   ``Flowers are just another alternative as dad gets a little
older and it seems like he has everything,'' Adamo said.
   Despite a gain in acceptance, many potential Father's Day flower
buyers still are concerned that they will hurt a man's macho psyche
by giving him flowers, florists said.
   ``We're doing a lot of `manly' looking designs, like red
carnations,'' said Mary Griffin of Greenhaus Florists in Traverse
City.
   Red was the most popular floral color for dad, while orchids
were the least suggested gift idea, florists said.
   But despite the growing popularity of sending a daffodil or two
to dad, Father's Day has a long way to go before challenging
Mother's Day, florists said. Knitter said sales on Mother's Day
outnumber those on Fathers's Day by a 16-to-1 margin.
   ``There's absolutely no comparison,'' Knitter said. ``Mother's
Day is the biggest day of the year for florists.''

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas recorded their
first major urban victory Saturday by capturing a provincial
capital in southeastern Afghanistan that had been abandoned by
Soviet forces, the guerrillas said.
   Reports reaching Islamabad through the Afghan News Agency said
Afghan government troops surrendered to guerrillas in the garrison
city of Kalat, about 220 miles south of Kabul, Afghanistan's
capital.
   The news agency is operated by Hezb-i-Islami rebels.
   It claimed the pro-Soviet government troops suffered heavy
losses, but it made no mention of guerrilla casualties.
   The agency claimed guerrillas staged a successful rocket attack
on a radar post near Kalat before the collapse of the city.
   ``At the beginning they (Soviet and Afghan troops) were
everywhere. We had to attack one place, then another,'' Abdul
Hamed, a commander with Syed Ahmed Gailani's National Islamic Front
of Afghanistan, was quoted as saying. ``Now they are all together.
We can fight them very strongly.''
   Soviet forces abandoned Zabul province this month, leaving the
defense of Kalat and other posts along the strategic
Kandahar-Ghazni road to government troops.
   Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, has been under
siege by guerrillas for the past three weeks. The guerrillas are
supported by the United States, China and Pakistan.
   Kalat was the first major city taken by the guerrillas since the
hit-and-run war against the government and Soviet troops began in
1979.
   On April 14, the Soviet Union signed documents in Geneva
agreeing to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops over a nine-month
period, beginning May 15 and ending Feb. 15, 1989. The withdrawal
began on schedule.
   Soviet troops intervened in December 1979.

<HEAD>Bus Drivers Protest Proposed Jail Term For Traffic Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bus service in most of the nation was
disrupted Saturday as drivers continued a strike to protest a
proposed jail term of 25 years for anyone convicted of killing
people in traffic accidents.
   The strike, which started Friday, was called by the Bangladesh
Road Transport Workers Federation.
   Federation leader Salahuddin Ahmed said about 30,000 buses,
minibuses and three-wheeled motorscooter taxis stayed off the
streets. An unknown number of freight-hauling trucks also were
idled.
   The strike was sparked by a bill introduced in Parliament two
weeks ago seeking a penalty of 25 years in jail for causing a
traffic death. The current penalty is five years.
   An average of two people are killed every day in traffic
accidents in Bangladesh, an impoverished nation where most people
cannot afford their own cars and even bus fares are beyond the
means of many people.
   Ahmed said the strikers also were protesting what he called
attempts by supporters of the governing Jatiya Party to extort
money from transport workers.
   The extortion allegation was denied by Abdul Khaleque, a Jatiya
member of Parliament who operates a trucking business. ``The
government party has nothing to do with the hoodlums fighting over
extortion money,'' he said.
   On Friday, at least 30 people were injured in Dhaka during
clashes between rival transport workers, police said. The
antagonists used small, homemade bombs, guns and machetes.
   The independent Azad newspaper said police arrested more than
100 strikers for violence. Police refused to comment on the report.

   A man shot to death in a Manhattan dance club
was an associate of reputed mob boss John Gotti and apparently was
trying to extort money from one of the club owners when he was
killed, it was reported Saturday.
   Anthony Mascuzzio often was seen with Gotti, reputed to be the
Gambino crime family leader, and had a long arrest record that
included charges of gambling and robbery, according to local
newspapers.
   Police sources said Mascuzzio, 43, allegedly was shaking down
one of the owners of the Bedrox discotheque on West 49th Street and
hitting the man on the head when he was shot early Friday.
   The co-owner, David Fisher, 43, was arrested later the same day
at Bellevue Hospital, where he was being treated for head wounds
allegedly caused by pistol-whipping, authorities said. He was
charged with second-degree murder.
   A police spokesman, Officer Joseph Gallagher, said police had
recovered a second .38-caliber revolver near the crime scene, with
five cartridges expended. Earlier, police had found a .38-caliber
revolver near Mascuzzio's body, with one spent shell.

   The GCC is the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council alliance,
which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates.
   Gulf Air is owned by Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Abu Dhabi, the
largest of the seven emirates in the U.A.E.
   The agreement is aimed at providing in-flight food worldwide for
Moslem passengers, who are not supposed to eat pork. Moslems also
are supposed to eat meat or poultry only if slaughtered while
Koranic verses are being chanted.
   The Marriott Corp. is based in Bethesda, Md.

<HEAD>United Technologies Again Drawn Into Defense Probe</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf, The latest, with company
comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after United Technologies was
investigated for its Pentagon dealings, the giant defense
contractor again finds itself in the middle of a probe involving
allegations of fraud and bribery.
   This time, the focus is on United Technologies' hiring of Melvyn
Paisley, a former top Navy official who resigned in April, 1987,
and began working as a consultant.
   United Technologies was among the major defense contractors who
quickly signed up. Paisley had knowledge and access, two of
Washington's most prized commodities.
   The latest investigation comes at a time when United
Technologies, the nation's eighth-largest defense contractor, has
regained status as a hot property. Drexel Burnham Lambert said
earlier this year that United Technologies ``will be the best stock
to own in the aerospace-defense group in 1988.''
   Asked to comment on the investigation, Larry Bingaman, a
spokesman for United Technologies, said Saturday: ``We're
cooperating fully with the investigation. Because the investigation
is ongoing, we can't comment further.''
   Based in Hartford, Conn., United Technologies is a conglomerate
built during the 15-year reign of the acquisition-minded Harry Gray.
   When Gray took over in 1972, the company was known as United
Aircraft Products Inc., and it was chiefly known for Pratt &
Whitney, one of the nation's prime builders of jet engines, and
Sikorsky, which produces helicopters.
   In 1981, Gray, then chairman and chief executive officer, hired
Alexander Haig as the company's president, a move that seemed
logical given the firm's status as a major Pentagon supplier and
Haig's background as the former commander of NATO and a top
national security official during the previous Republican
presidencies.
   Haig didn't last long, leaving only a year after he began.
   Attempts to reach Haig and Gray were unsuccessful. Neither man
returned calls to his office.
   Gray stepped down 18 months ago and was succeeded by Robert F.
Daniell, who began a series of layoffs and sales of some
businesses, moves designed to improve productivity. Daniels'
actions have won him praise on Wall Street.
   United Technologies' sales rose to $17.2 billion last year,
compared to $15.7 billion in 1986; profits zoomed from $73 million
in 1986 to $592 million last year. Earnings per share also rocketed
up, from 54 cents in 1986 to $4.52 in 1987.
   Part of the overhaul involved Pratt & Whitney, which was
reorganized in an effort to try to reclaim a larger share of the
market in its long-running fight against General Electric, the
nation's other major builder of aircraft engines.
   That competition is fought on two major battlefields _
commercial sales and military contracts.
   Last October, Japan Air Lines picked General Electric over P&W
for a purchase of new engines and P&W officials admitted the sale
was lost because of P&W problems in providing timely support for
older-model engines.
   The same problem had caused P&W headaches three years ago in its
dealings with the Air Force, long the largest customer for P&W
engines.
   Pratt & Whitney had been the sole source for engines for the
F-15 and F-16 jets, the service's top-of-the-line fighters, but
there were numerous complaints from the service that the company
was too slow to fix problems.
   Eventually, the Air Force turned to General Electric and has
given GE about half its engine business the past three years.
   In 1986, the Justice Department ended a four-year investigation
into charges that P&W had charged $22 million worth of questionable
billings to the Pentagon from 1979 to 1984.
   The allegedly excessive billings covered country club
memberships, political contributions, private planes, professional
football tickets, and even Halloween costumes.
   But federal prosecutors decided against bringing charges because
they said the government regulations were so vague and complicated
that it couldn't be determined which P&W expenses were reimbursable.
   The firm eventually turned the tables on GE on the Navy's
F-A-18, the plane designed to be the service's top fighter-bomber
for the rest of the century.
   GE had been providing engines for the F-A-18, but P&W, at the
Navy's request, built a prototype engine to compete for the
business and was eventually approved by the Navy as a second
contractor.
   In the past years, P&W has won $316 million worth of contracts
to build engines for the F-A-18.
   At the same time, P&W also moved in as a second builder of
engines for the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor jet being developed for
the Marines and the Navy. GE had originally been the sole source
for V-22 engines.
   During the time the decisions were made on those two Navy
planes, Paisley was a top official of the service. He was the
assistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering and
systems.
   When he left the Navy, Paisley was hired by United Technologies
chiefly as a consultant on P&W's efforts to sell the 404 engine for
the F-A-18 and the engine for the V-22, according to sources who
declined to be identified.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, under scrutiny by
the House ethics committee, told a a prayer breakfast gathering
Saturday to support democracy by buying American and paying taxes.
   ``We say how bad it is, this trade deficit, but how often do we
wake up in the morning and look at our Swiss watch and turn on our
Sony, then go to work and talk about the trade deficit?'' the Texas
Democrat said.
   Mayor Tom Bradley, a friend and political ally of Wright,
invited the speaker to give the keynote address at the annual
Mayor's Prayer Breakfast.
   ``We come not to judge political leaders, but to pray for them
so they can make the right decisions, not the politically expedient
ones,'' Bradley said.
   Wright was shielded by aides after the speech and would not
answer reporters' questions.
   The House committee on standards of official conduct voted
unanimously June 11 to look into six areas in which Wright
allegedly used his position to benefit himself and certain
associates financially.
   The ethics accusations against Wright involve a book publishing
deal in which he received 55 percent of the royalties from a
paperback published by a friend who did work on Wright's campaigns.
He is also being investigated for possibly lobbying on behalf of
oil companies in which he may have had an interest and for
pressuring federal officials on behalf of Texas bankers.
   Wright has repeatedly said he is innocent.
   Actor Dean Jones, who presided over the breakfast, asked the
group to include Wright in their prayers.
   ``I want all of those who will pray at least once a week for one
year for the honorable Jim Wright to raise your hand,'' Jones said.
   Most of the audience of 1,900 responded.
   Wright urged the group to support the principle of paying taxes.
   ``How many of us have wanted all the services of government and
not wanted to pay taxes for them?'' Wright said.
   The audience responded with cries of ``amen'' and ``hallelujah.''
   Wright read passages from the Bible and expounded on forgiveness.
   ``It's hard to be forgiven. It tears down our defense system. If
someone forgives you ... you lose your pride,'' he said.
   As an example, Wright cited Jose Napolean Duarte, the terminally
ill president of El Salvador, which has been torn by eight years of
civil war.
   ``He called upon the enemies of that country and said, `I'll
grant you amnesty ... and amnesty means I forgive you,''' Wright
said of Duarte, who was recently diagnosed as having cancer.

<HEAD>Greece Blocks EEC Farm Deal, Compromise Sought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece on Friday blocked a farm-price
compromise that took European Economic Community ministers three
months to reach but officials said hopes remained that a solution
could still be found.
   The austere farm package calls for price freezes or cuts to keep
the EEC's 1988-89 farm budget within a $33.5 billion ceiling
imposed by EEC leaders at a summit last February.
   Officials said the Greek agricultural minister, Yannis Potakis,
threatened to veto the package that had been accepted by his 11 EEC
partners if Ignaz Kiechle, the West German delegate and the
meeting's chairman, put it to a vote.
   Potakis claimed a price boost for Greek farmers would not cost
the EEC budget as much as calculated and asked for higher prices
for Greek farmers.
   The EEC commission that drafted the farm budget acknowledged its
calculations might not be correct but said it could not change the
entire price scheme to which 11 countries agreed. It said other
members would ask for additional changes and thus undermine the
package.
   A new meeting may be called while the commission studies
possible concessions to Greece.
   The agriculture ministers began their meeting last Monday.
Throughout the negotiations the commission made concessions to
various demands by agreeing to a gradual dismantling of a complex
system of taxes on exports of farm produce from countries with
weaker currencies.
   Kiechle could call for another farm ministers meeting before his
six-month term as chairman expires on June 30, officials said.

<HEAD>Investigators Display Cache From Red Brigades Hideout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Saturday displayed arms,
ammunition and money seized during a raid on a Red Brigade hideout
and said the items may provide answers in four killings and an
armored car robbery.
   Prosecutors said ballistics tests could determine if nine
suspects, accused of being Red Brigade members, used the weapons to
kill former U.S. diplomat Leaman R. Hunt, Italian Sen. Roberto
Ruffilli, economist Ezio Tarantelli and former Florence Mayor Lando
Conti.
   An anti-terrorist squad of the carabinieri, Italy's elite
paramilitary police, discovered the hideout Wednesday after a
two-year investigation.
   Five men and four women were arrested after the raid on charges
of illegal possession of weapons and participating in an armed
band, a blanket charge often used against terrorists.
   The Red Brigades dominated Italy in the 1970s with kidnappings
and assassinations, culminating in the 1978 murder of former Prime
Minister Aldo Moro.
   In the apartment in this northern city, authorities found a
scorpion submachine gun, two other automatic weapons, a pistol, a
shotgun, documents related to killings claimed by the Red Brigades,
and $46,000 in cash.
   Police also found a gray hat similar to those worn by Italian
postmen and large decals with the blue and yellow emblem of the
Italian postal service.
   The Red Brigade terrorists who killed Sen. Roberto Ruffilli on
April 16 in Forli, a small town near Bologna, were disguised as
mailmen and drove a van with a postal emblem.
   Ruffilli was a Christian Democrat and close friend and adviser
of Premier Ciriaco De Mita.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said investigators believe the
submachine gun found in the apartment was the same one used to kill
Ruffilli, Tarantelli and Conti because the Red Brigades were
thought to use one of the same type.
   The Red Brigades claimed responsibility for all three killings.
   Tarantelli, who was shot to death in Rome in March 1985, was a
leading official of the Christian Democrat-dominated labor union
CISL and had been a member of the government commission that
drafted a plan to reduce Italian workers' automatic wage increases.
   Conti, who was killed in February 1986 in Florence, was a
consultant for a company that produced radar and other military
electronic equipment. He had been accused in left-wing pamphlets of
``exporting war.''
   The Red Brigades also claimed responsibility for the February
1984 murder of Hunt, a career diplomat in Rome.
   Col. Luigi Nobili, commander of Milan's carabinieri, said
investigators believe one of the other weapons found in the
apartment may have been used to kill Hunt.

   Faithful members of the Mormon church have
toiled in this remote Mississippi River town for a quarter century
to patch together broken reminders of their tumultuous history.
   The estimated $20 million restoration project in Nauvoo is
nearing completion. The church announced earlier this month it
would spend about $750,000 on one more major undertaking:
restoration of the old jail in nearby Carthage where church founder
Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed in 1844.
   The jail is one of the most sacred spots for 6.5 million members
of the Mormon faith worldwide. Its restoration begins as the church
prepares for the 150th anniversary next year of its followers
settlement in Illinois.
   ``My orders are to make the jail the most beautiful site in
Carthage,'' said Jim Taylor, who manages the Nauvoo restoration
site. ``This is where Joseph Smith sealed his testimony _ he never
denied it. And it's a sacred spot for our church.
   ``When that project is done, the restoration of Nauvoo will be
over, for the most part.''
   Taylor, 63, is an electrical engineer, a lawyer and recently
retired president of Utah Power and Light, a company with $3
billion in assets and $1 billion in annual revenue.
   Taylor also is fairly typical of the people who come to Nauvoo
each year to live and work on a labor of love: the restoration of a
town that was envisioned as the home of the Mormon church.
   ``We are trying to tell the story of the life of Joseph Smith
here and acquaint people with our church,'' Taylor said. ``People
come here for the historical experience of seeing a town as it
looked in 1839. And they learn that we really aren't any different
from them.
   ``For Mormons, it's a special place. We encourage all Mormons to
come to Nauvoo and feel the spirit of the place. They can see the
sacrifices made by their parents and grandparents. And they can
actually see where Joseph Smith and the others walked and talked,
lived and died.''
   About 100,000 visitors a year travel to Nauvoo and find an
impressive assortment of restored brick and log homes, shops and
other buildings in the town of about 1,100 residents 200 miles
north of St. Louis. About 40,000 people a year also visit the jail
at Carthage, 23 miles southeast of Nauvoo.
   Other townfolk have followed the Mormons' lead and have restored
a number of hotels, shops and businesses in the business district.
Nauvoo offers quaint bed-and-breakfast inns, historic old hotels
and novelty shops.
   Modern visitors' centers offer displays of Mormon history,
artifacts and films on the town and its link to Smith, Brigham
Young and the church.
   The Mormon settlement is on 1,000 acres in the ``flats'' below
Nauvoo's main business district and was swamp land when Smith and
his congregation arrived in 1839. The land was drained and each
resident was given an acre for a house, barn and a few animals.
   Within a few years, a city of 15,000 sprang from the swamp,
rivaling Chicago as the largest city in Illinois, and construction
of a huge, limestone temple began on a bluff overlooking the town.
   However, the friction with non-believers that forced Smith out
of Palmyra, N.Y.; Kirtland, Ohio; and Independence, Mo., dogged the
settlers into Illinois.
   Church members clashed with non-believers, who rejected Smith's
claims that he had spoken with God, been visited by angels and was
a prophet. The conflict eventually led to Smith's death at the
hands of a mob that shot him and his brother to death on June 27,
1844, in the Carthage jail.
   Brigham Young assumed the leadership of the church _ officially
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints _ and two years
later led a mass exodus from Nauvoo, taking church followers west
to their eventual settlement in Salt Lake City.

   A man who says he has difficulty with
small words like ``it'' won an adult spelling bee Saturday when he
correctly spelled ``mythopoeia.''
   ``A piece of cake,'' said 40-year-old John Marron, whose prowess
in the corporate-sponsored contest earned him and his wife a trip
to the Caribbean island of Curacao.
   Marron, a family counselor at the Association for the
Advancement of Mental Health in Princeton, said he was taught well
by nuns at a Catholic grammar school in Davenport, Iowa.
   ``We learned the phonetics of spelling,'' he said. He didn't
come across mythopoeia _ creating a myth _ until later in life,
perhaps at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore or John F. Kennedy
University in Orinda, Calif., he said.
   The New Jersey offices of the Olsten Corp., a Westbury,
N.Y.-based company that provides temporary employees, sponsored the
bee to highlight its concern about literacy in the workplace. The
company touted the adult contest as the first of its kind in the
nation.
   Marron savored his victory over 29 other finalists at the
Meadowlands Hilton and recalled the disappointment of a second
grade spelling contest.
   ``I went out on `accommodate,''' he said.
   But this time, Marron survived eight rounds and a tense
spell-off with runner-up Tim Peach, 24, of Fort Lee.
   ``I really don't have too much trouble spelling,'' Marron said.
``It's those little words like `it' that can really stump me.''
   Unlike many contestants, Marron said he did not study for the
bee but relied on his memory and several years of studying Latin,
Spanish and French to help with etymology.
   Peach, an actuarial at Kwasha Lipton in Fort Lee, lost by
misspelling `viridescent,' which means slightly green. He said he
borrowed some books by William F. Buckley from his boss to prepare
for the bee.
   ``I skimmed them for big words and there were a lot of them,''
he said.
   Peach said he expected to put the second place prize of a $2,000
scholarship toward his fiancee's education at a music school in New
York City.
   Saturday's finalists survived a first-round written phase June
11 involving representatives from about 80 corporations across the
state, many of whom had won in-house spelling bees.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush on Saturday
accused Democrat Michael Dukakis of being soft on criminals for
supporting a Massachusetts program letting inmates, including
murderers, out of prison on weekends.
   ``What did the Democratic governor of Massachusetts think he was
doing when he let convicted first-degree murderers out on weekend
passes?'' said Bush, the all but certain Republican presidential
nominee. ``Even after one of the criminals brutally raped a woman
and stabbed her fiance, why didn't he admit his mistake?''
   Bush, who was touring the drought-damaged Midwest, issued his
sharpest attack so far on Dukakis over the prison furlough issue.
   ``I think Gov. Dukakis owes the people of the United States an
explanation for why he supported this outrageous program,'' Bush
told the Illinois State Republican Convention.
   Bush told his audience that at least one woman was raped as a
result of the prison furlough program.
   ``Eight months later he was still defending his program,'' Bush
said of his Democratic rival for the White House. ``And only when
the Massachusetts Legislature voted by an overwhelming majority to
abolish the program for murders did he finally give in.''
   In April Dukakis signed a bill banning furloughs for
first-degree murders. The bill was prompted by a public outcry over
the rape, which occurred last year in Maryland.
   ``We don't let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent
people,'' Bush said.
   The Dukakis campaign accused Bush of misrepresenting the facts.
   ``George Bush should know better,'' Dukakis press secretary
Dayton Duncan said while traveling with the candidate in Texas.
``He should check the record of Ronald Reagan as (California)
governor, the federal system in his own administration and of 22
states with Republican governors before he makes more wild
accusations about furlough systems.''
   Bush, accompanied by Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng and
Illinois Gov. James Thompson, visited a drought-stricken farm,
where corn plants were parched and little more than ankle-high.
   ``We need two inches of rain before two weeks. This corn is
hurting,'' the farmer, Raymond Poe, told Bush.
   The vice president, in his shirtsleeves, sat on a bale of hay
and discussed the drought with a group of local farmers.
   ``I've learned how serious this problem is of drought and the
kind of suffering it can cause in the farm community,'' Bush said.
   But he didn't hold out much in the way of federal help.
   ``There are serious budget restraints on what the federal
government can do,'' he said.
   The vice president insisted that his farm visit _ added to the
schedule at the last minute _ was not politically motivated.
   ``That's absolutely absurd,'' he said. ``We've got a national
problem and I'm the vice president of the United States. When
agricultural America is hurting, of course we care.''
   Lyng, meanwhile, said that while the drought was clearly a
serious problem for U.S. farmers, ``a drought in an election year
is worse than a drought in a non-election year.''
   ``People overreact,'' Lyng told a group of reporters at Andrews
Air Force Base near Washington as he prepared to board Air Force
Two with Bush for the flight to Illinois.
   ``With people running for office, you get a sense of added
urgency,'' Lyng said.
   The agriculture secretary said he did not mean to imply the
drought was not a major one. ``It's a real drought,'' he said.
   Asked what measures the government might take to aid farmers,
Lyng said, ``We've tried about all we think we can do in terms of
emergency steps _ except money. And it's too early to consider
that.''
   ``What you really need is rain, and there's no way you can bring
that,'' he said.
   Thompson, speaking with reporters, said ``farmers aren't
stupid'' and wouldn't blame the drought on politicians.
   ``Farmers have coped with drought, hail, tornadoes, too much
rain, insects for years and years and years,'' Thompson said. ``The
Reagan-Bush administration has done more than any other
administration in the history of the United States to help
farmers.''
   Meanwhile, Bush told the Illinois GOP convention that ``we're
involved in a close election and unity is important.''
   He said that Republicans were more unified now than ever before.
   The vice president also repeated his call for beefing up the war
on drugs, and added a new twist.
   ``Because trade in drugs is like terrorism, we must expand our
covert activities to fight it,'' Bush said.
   Asked later what he meant by ``covert activities,'' Bush said:
``If you discuss it, it's not covert. Just let it stand. If there's
going to be a war, let's fight the war using every aspect we have.''
   Bush was also attending two fund-raising events in Chicago
before returning to Washington late Saturday.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There was little relief for drought areas Saturday with wet
weather extending from the Northeast into the South and rain only
scattered over the dry upper Midwest.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, the heaviest rain was
0.20 of an inch at Corpus Christi, Texas, and no other official
stations recorded over a tenth of an inch, the National Weather
Service said.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from around New York's Long Island
southwestward through the central and southern Appalachians into
parts of the lower Mississippi Valley.
   The strongest storms developed across parts of eastern Tennessee
into western parts of North and South Carolina. Hail the diameter
of dimes was reported at Horse Shoe, N.C.
   Thunderstorms also rumbled across the Florida Keys.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered over parts of
southern Texas.
   Showers moved from eastern parts of Iowa into south-central
Wisconsin and showers and thunderstorms were scattered across
eastern North Dakota into northwestern Minnesota.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms moved across parts of the
desert Southwest. A storm system anchored over the Pacific Ocean
southwest of San Diego whipped up wind gusting to 35 mph across the
mountains of southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 102 at Garden City, Kan. The low
Saturday morning was 38 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms were
forecast from the upper Great Lakes into northern parts of the
middle Mississippi Valley, and across the western side of the
central Rockies. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were
forecast from the southern Appalachians into the central Gulf Coast
and Florida.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the central and southern
California coast; between 100 and 105 across the central Plains
from south-central Nebraska into central and western Kansas, and in
the valleys of northern and central California; between 100 and 110
across the desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much of
the rest of the nation.

   Czechoslovak police detained at least 12
people and ordered 33 Westerners to leave the country after raiding
an unofficial peace seminar in Prague Saturday, an emigre
publication reported.
   The nationalities of the foreigners expelled were not given.
   More than 50 people had gathered in the Prague apartment of Jan
Urban despite warnings by police not to hold such meetings,
according to the London-based Palach Press.
   It said the police raid came after the participants signed a
statement condemning the disruptions by police of two peace
meetings Friday. The statement also supported a proposal by the
Czechoslovak human rights group Charter 77 to set up a ``European
Peace Parliament'' of non-governmental organizations.
   Police confiscated all of the documents and detained up to 12 of
the Czechoslovak participants, Palach Press said.
   It said 33 Westerners from at least 16 nations who were at the
meeting were ordered to leave Czechsolovakia immediately.
   Twenty people were detained Friday when police disrupted
meetings at two different apartments, the Palach Press said. All
were released after being told not to hold similar meetings,
according to the report.
   A third meeting dealing with conscientious objectors and
alternatives to military service was held Friday without police
intervention, Palach Press said.

   Police beat and detained members of several
political groups who demonstrated Saturday in support of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, a witness reported.
   Yuri Mityunov, a member of the Democratic Union, a group that
proclaims itself an alternative to the Communist Party, said as
many as 10 people were attacked by police and taken away after the
hour-long rally by a few hundred demonstrators outside the office
of the government newspaper Izvestia.
   ``At the end of the demonstration, the police began to beat
demonstrators and some people were arrested,'' Mityunov said in a
telephone interview.
   He said he could not determine exactly how many were detained or
what happened to them.
   He said the demonstrators, members of four unofficial political
groups that support ``perestroika,'' or Gorbachev's program of
reforms in certain segments of society, were told by police their
demonstration was illegal because it was not registered with Moscow
city authorities.
   Demonstrators carried signs saying, ``Gorbachev we are with
you,'' Mityunov reported. He also said they protested special
privileges for top Communist Party officials and demanded a
political system based on the law.
   The demonstrators included members of the groups Perestroika 88,
Democratic Perestroika, Civil Dignity and Community, according to
Mityunov.

   Armed gang members shot up a
graduation party, wounding five teen-agers, and one man was slain
in gang violence elsewhere in the Los Angeles area, police said
Saturday.
   Six alleged gang members were arrested after shots were fired
into a car in Hollywood, authorities said.
   Growing gang violence in Los Angeles and parts of Los Angeles
County has led police to conduct weekend-long sweeps that have
resulted in hundreds of arrests.
   Teen-agers at a dance in a garage in this southern Los Angeles
County community were attacked late Friday, Lt. Rob Mickelson said.
   Two men apparently went into the party and got into an argument
that ended with the shooting, he said. Two boys, ages 17 and 15,
and three 17-year-old girls suffered minor wounds, he said.
   A description of the getaway car led to two arrests, and an
AK-47 rifle and a semi-automatic handgun were seized, he said.
   A Los Angeles man was shot to death and another wounded early
Saturday in a gang-related attack at a dance attended by rival
gangs in the county's Vermont area, said sheriff's Deputy Roxanna
Schuchman.
   A fight had broken out outside a social club between two men,
one of whom pulled a gun and fired several shots, Ms. Schuchman
said.
   Six alleged gang members were arrested in Hollywood early
Saturday after they allegedly fired five shots into a car, whose
occupant was unhurt, police said.

<HEAD>Exclusive Male Club In Washington Will Start Accepting Women
Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exclusive, all-male Cosmos Club, breaking
with its 110-year history, voted overwhelmingly Saturday to accept
women as members, its president announced.
   Tedson J. Meyers, the club's president, told a news conference
that the club membership voted almost unanimously _ ``about 98
percent, as best as the eye can tell'' _ to begin accepting the
names of women for nomination. He said shortly after the vote, the
names of four women were submitted.
   ``This is truly an exciting period for the club,'' said Meyers,
while standing outside the club's mansion on Embassy Row on
Massachusetts Avenue.
   The club, whose members once included Supreme Court Justices
Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis D. Brandeis, twice before _ in 1973
and 1975 _ rejected petitions by members to permit women into the
club which was founded by geologist John Wesley Powell in 1878.
This time, however, the club's leadership _ its officers and board
of management _ made the proposal.
   ``We, the officers, are amazed, surprised and delighted by the
outcome,'' said Meyers, a lawyer and former member of the City
Council in Washington. ``We knew there was a changing mood among
the membership, but did not know it would be so overwhelming.''
   He said on a standing vote, only 14 of the 800 members attending
voted against the admission of women. ``We stopped counting when we
got to 700,'' Meyers said.
   Last fall, the Washington Human Rights Office ruled that ``there
is probable cause to believe'' that the club's men-only policy
violates the city's anti-discrimination law. The office was ready
to order public hearings on the case, which could have resulted in
the loss of all city licenses and permits, if the all-male policy
had continued.
   Meyers said although the legal issues confronting the club ``may
have been a catalyst, the great majority of members do not believe
that the membership policy of this club is a legal issue. Rather
the issues are ethical and moral. They related to social changes
members individually could accept or ignore as they prefer.
   ``The question for us has never been whether the club may remain
a club for men, but rather whether it should remain a club for
men,'' he said. ``Such a question should be resolved, not in the
courthouse but in the clubhouse. For us it has, and we are proud of
that.''
   Meyers said the club has a limit of 2,500 residential and
nonresidential members who pay $900 a year and $450 a year,
respectively, in dues. There is also a category for senior and
emeritus members, for which there is no limit on the numbers.
   Meyers said the club has between 3,000 to 3,100 members, down
several hundred in recent years. There are 350 vacancies within the
2,500 authorized slots, but he said the limit could be raised if
the members choose to do so.
   Women candidates will have to qualify in one of the three
categories that men do _ to be recognized in science, literature or
the arts, well-cultivated in any any of those areas or
distinguished in a learned profession or public service.
   ``I believe we all know women who can qualify,'' said Meyers.
``As a matter of fact, I have one and am just waiting for her to
fill out the necessary forms.''
   Up until now, female guests of members, as well as wives and
widows of members and former members, were allowed to dine in the
downstairs dining rooms. But women were not allowed in the
second-floor members dining room, except on Thursday and Friday
evenings and weekends.
   A person must be nominated by a member _ the club does not
recruit, nor can a candidate apply uninvited _ be co-sponsored by
another member and have four supporters to be eligible.

   Vice President George Bush launched a sharp attack Saturday
against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whom he accused of
coddling criminals by allowing some convicts out of prison on
weekends.
   The likely nominees of the Republican and Democratic parties
spent the day working to shore up support in parts of the country
where each is considered weakest: Dukakis in the South and Bush in
the Midwest.
   ``We don't let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent
people,'' Bush said at the Illinois Republican convention in
Springfield.
   ``Even after one of the criminals brutally raped a woman and
stabbed her fiance, why didn't he (Dukakis) admit his mistake?''
Bush said.
   Bush's attack Saturday came three weeks after a strategy session
during which the vice president's campaign indicated Dukakis would
be confronted directly on domestic issues and his management record
as governor of Massachusetts.
   Reaction from the Dukakis campaign came quickly on Saturday.
   ``George Bush should know better,'' Dukakis press secretary
Dayton Duncan said while traveling with the candidate in Texas.
``He should check the record of Ronald Reagan as (California)
governor, the federal system in his own administration and of 22
states with Republican governors before he makes more wild
accusations about furlough systems.''
   Dukakis last April signed a law banning weekend passes for
prisoners convicted of murder, reversing his administration's
policy of supporting the program which began in 1972.
   That ban was passed by the state Legislature after a convicted
murderer, who escaped while on a weekend pass, raped a woman in
Maryland last year.
   ``Eight months later he was still defending his program,'' Bush
said. ``And only when the Massachusetts Legislature voted by an
overwhelming majority to abolish the program for murders did he
finally give in.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was in Texas Saturday, where he attended the
funeral of Willie Velasquez, founder of the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project, which led drives to register
Hispanics to vote.
   Velasquez ``was a nuts-and-bolts political leader but his
commitment went deeper than that _ to the very soul of this country
to the very heart of our democratic system,'' Dukakis said in
Spanish in his eulogy delivered and the funeral Mass in San
Antonio. ``His goal was not to change the faces of those we elect
to public service but to improve the quality of public service
itself.''
   After the funeral, Dukakis was heading for Houston to address
the Texas Democratic convention, where the last of the state's 211
national convention delegates were being picked.
   Dukakis, who won the state's primary on March 8, held but a
narrow lead in delegates over Jesse Jackson. Dukakis had 81
delegates, while Jackson had 70 and another 60 were uncommitted,
according to The Associated Press delegate count.
   In a speech to the Texas Democrats, Dukakis looked ahead to the
November election, saying, ``If anyone tells you that we can't win
in the South, or that we can't win in the West, or that we can't
win in the great state of Texas, don't you believe it.
   ``You tell them that we're going to win.''
   The vice president was touring drought damage in Illinois with
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng on Saturday.
   Meanwhile, Democrat Jesse Jackson walked into the parched
cornfield of an Illinois Republican and prayed for rain on Saturday.
   ``I think he ought to have some influence on what happens in the
next few years,'' farmer Dan Mau, a registered Republican, said
after Jackson prayed in his field.
   Jackson later told delegates to the Illinois Democratic
convention that there should be a national moratorium on farm
foreclosures.
   ``No one should lose his land because of this drought,'' Jackson
said.
   Before leaving Washington aboard Air Force Two, Lyng said that
reaction to the drought has been exaggerated because this is an
election year.
   ``A drought in an election year is worse than a drought in a
non-election year,'' Lyng said. ``People overreact.''
   Nevertheless, Lyng said the drought is real.
   ``We've tried about all we think we can do in terms of emergency
steps _ except money,'' Lyng said. ``And it's too early to consider
that.''

   Anti-racism concerts in three continents began
Saturday night with a message from President Francois Mitterrand
saying there was still work to be done in the fight for liberty,
equality and fraternity.
   The New York-Paris-Dakar concerts were organized by SOS-Racism,
France's largest anti-racist group.
   ``Music takes nourishment from all cultures ... all colors,''
Mitterrand said in a message to the Paris concert held on the
city's eastern outskirts at Vincennes. ``You are together tonight
because there is still work to be done in the fight for liberty,
equality and fraternity.''
   The Vincennes concert started at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) and was to
last till dawn.
   Concerts also were being held at the Demba Diop stadium in
Dakar, Senegal, and at the Apollo Theater in New York. Television
tapes showed excerpts at each concert of the other performances.
   Harlem Desir, president of SOS-Racism, flew to Dakar Friday in
the private jet of Senegalese President Abdou Diouf to be present
for the Dakar concert where Zaire's Kanda Bongo Man and Jamaica's
the Wailers were among the performers.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Harley-Davidson Owners Rumble Into Milwaukee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was a homecoming for Harley-Davidsons
Saturday, and thousands of bikers came to party, swap stories and
share what they say is a special bond among ``hog'' owners.
   ``This is going to sound crazy, but I just kept patting my bike
all the way here, saying, `You're coming home,'' said Chuck Dungan,
a mechanic from Kansas City, Mo.
   Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson Inc., the country's only
motorcycle maker, called on bikers from across the United States
and Canada to come celebrate its 85th anniversary and raise money
to fight muscular dystrophy.
   By late Saturday afternoon, officials estimated 11,000 bikers
had arrived for the weekend event, which is expected to attract at
least 20,000 riders.
   Dungan said owners of hogs, as Harley-Davidsons are called,
share a bond with each other and the company.
   ``It just kind of gives you goose bumps,'' he said of the
gathering.
   ``If you ride a Harley, you've got an infinite home in
Milwaukee,'' said Bob Bunton, from Lakeland, Fla.
   At Waukesha County Technical College, bikers turned a parking
lot into a sea of black and red metal with glistening chrome.
   The riders included middle-age men with scruffy beards and
leather jackets, and couples toting 35 millimeter cameras. The vast
majority wore black T-shirts bearing the Harley-Davidson name.
   Dennis Hamon of Lake Tahoe, Calif., said his bike's transmission
once broke in Iowa, and another Harley-Davidson owner lent him new
equipment.
   ``Man, there's something about Harleys,'' he said. ``There's
more than a machine. Anytime you pull into a town and you see
Harleys, you know you have something in common.''
   Ruby Lovett, 59, of Worcester Mass., suffered a broken arm in
Syracuse, N.Y., but that didn't stop her and her husband from
completing their journey.
   ``I just had to go on,'' she said.
   One rider who sat quietly among the crowd was Pat Harley, whose
grandfather, William S. Harley, was one of the company's founders.
   ``I was riding before I could walk,'' Harley said.
   Harley sat on his bike, which had a sidecar that carried a
wheelchair. He said he was paralyzed in an accident over two
decades ago, but that didn't dent his enthusiasm.
   ``Just because you can't hold your bike up doesn't mean you
can't ride,'' he said.
   Most bikers gathered at the college or at another designated
spot in Kenosha County. Then they rode into Milwaukee's lakefront
and the festival grounds in groups of 50 to 100, watched by
hundreds of spectators who gathered at overpasses along the highway.
   Bikers gave a $10 donation to muscular dystrophy to get into the
weekend festival, which features music and carnival games, and
others were admitted for a donation of $14.
   Meanwhile, the nation's oldest motorcycle race was expected to
attract as many as 50,000 bikers to central New Hampshire over the
weekend.
   By late afternoon, about 25,000 bikers were in Weirs Beach, a
popular amusement area in Laconia in the state's Lakes Region, said
police Capt. Robert Babineau. Thousands of spectators and
motorcyclists packed Bryar Motorsport Park, where the Loudon
Classic and other motorcycle races were held.
   Babineau reported about 130 arrests in Weirs Beach, mostly for
disorderly conduct and motor vehicle violations. Numerous accidents
also were reported, all of them minor.

   Eritrean rebels on Saturday claimed 810
government soldiers were killed in a three-day battle at a major
military outpost in Eritrea province in northern Ethiopia.
   They also said 1,240 soldiers were wounded in the fight for the
garrison headquarters near the town of Keren, 55 miles northeast of
the Eritrean administrative capital of Asmara.
   That would be near a main highway used to transport relief aid
to drought victims.
   The rebels' clandestine radio station Voice of the Broad Masses
of Eritrea said in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi the offensive
was mounted by guerrillas of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
last Tuesday and ended Thursday when the soldiers abandoned their
positions. It did not give any casualties for the rebels who are
fighting for an independent Eritrea.
   Foreign aid workers distributing relief supplies to hundreds of
thousands of drought victims in Eritrea were recently evacuated
from the north on orders of the Marxist government. It said
supplies were going to the rebels.
   There was no indpendent confirmation of the rebels' claim.
Government officials in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, were
not available for comment.
   Foreign observers say both sides in the 27-year-old civil war
frequently exaggerate their claims of victories.
   The secessionist rebels said their troops also captured 388
weapons, six radio sets and a large amount of ammunition.

<HEAD>Opposition Leaders Criticize Appointment of New Defense Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on
Saturday criticized the reinstatement in the army of Interior
Minister Elias Wessin y Wessin and his designation as defense
minister by President Joaquin Balaguer.
   Balaguer reinstated Gen. Wessin y Wessin, a man once accused of
plotting Balaguer's ouster, on Friday after firing Defense Minister
Lt. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera.
   Wessin y Wessin, 60, an unsuccessful candidate in the 1968 and
1982 presidential elections, was interior minister in 1971 when
Balaguer sent him into exile, accusing him of planning to overthrow
the government. He returned in 1978 and in 1986 backed Balaguer's
successful campaign and later was named interior minister.
   Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, head of the opposition Dominican
Revolutionary Party, called Wessin y Wessin's designation
``inconvenient, inopportune and a violation of the constitution of
the republic.''
   ``That post should be held by army officers who are first in
line in the military hierarchy, not by an active politician with a
controversial past in Dominican politics, especially at the level
of the armed forces,'' Pena Gomez said.
   The general secretary of the Dominican Communist Party, Narciso
Isa Conde, said the appointment of Wessin y Wessin was done to
please the United States. He said that after being outside of the
armed forces for more than 20 years Wessin y Wessin assumed his new
position ``without any kind of leadership'' in the military.
   Wessin y Wessin is the third defense minister designated by
Balaguer in the 23 months.
   Barrera, 66, is the only surviving member of the group of 12 men
who in 1961 ambused and assasinated dictator Rafael L. Trujillo.
Congress declared him a national hero and general-for-life in 1962
for bringing an end to 30 years of dictatorship.
   In a decree released late Friday Balaguer designated Barrera as
a general inspector at the service of the president and praised his
``high merits and notable services to his country, which have
contributed to strengthen the nation's institutions.''
   In 1963, Wessin y Wessin and other military officers
participated in the overthrow of leftist President Juan Bosch that
eventually led to the 1965 civil war. Wessin y Wessin led the fight
and asked the United States to intervene.
   After the war Wessin y Wessin was sent to Panama as a military
attache and he retired from the army in 1968.

<HEAD>Cooperation Stressed, But Agricultural Subsidies May Disrupt
Summit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs final 2 grafs with 6 new grafs to include information on
British position on farm subsidies</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World leaders went out of their way to stress
international cooperation Saturday on the eve of the seven-nation
economic summit, but a contentious fight over agricultural
subsidies threatened to disrupt the hoped-for tranquility.
   The 14th annual meeting between the world's largest industrial
countries _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada _ was being held under the tightest
security ever seen in Canada's largest city.
   A 3,000-member security force was deployed around the
Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center where the government leaders
will begin meeting Sunday, protected by 15-foot-high chain link
security fences.
   In his weekly radio address, broadcast from the Oval Office,
President Reagan looked back to his first economic summit, also in
Canada. He said there had been changes for the better in the world
economy in the intervening seven years.
   ``We have led the world toward a remarkable consensus that
economic freedom, not state planning and intervention, holds the
key to growth and development,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said the Toronto summit would be a chance to assure that
this ``great venture to progress continues'' through doing more to
support economic coordination among the major countries and by
removing remaining trade barriers.
   This year's summit is expected to be a low-key gathering, in
part because President Reagan is a lame-duck with only seven months
left in office but also because the economy is doing surprisingly
well, especially in light of the fears of a global recession that
were widespread immediately following the October stock market
crash.
   Growth in most of the major countries has accelerated this year,
driving down unemployment rates to the lowest levels of this decade.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is hoping his
position as the summit host will give him a political boost at
home, said Saturday that it would be wrong to dismiss the summit as
a do-nothing affair just because no major initiatives are expected.
   ``The coordination and cooperation economically that emanates
from the summits is a very major contribution towards world
growth,'' Mulroney said during a visit to the rooms where the
nearly 3,000 journalists from 50 countries were setting up shop.
   ``What would we have done last October in the light of the
market meltdowns without the Group of Seven,'' Mulroney asked,
referring to the seven summit nations. ``The G-7 was able to step
in and send signals of confidence to markets around the world.''
   Reagan, who is attending his eighth and final economic summit,
will be the last world leader to arrive on Sunday.
   The president said Saturday that efforts to stop illegal drug
trafficking and rebuild the economies of Afghanistan and the
Philippines also would be on the agenda for the summit as would his
proposal, first made last year at the Venice summit, to end farm
subsidies by the end of the century.
   But Reagan's farm proposal has drawn support from few of the
other leaders, with Japan, West Germany and France raising some of
the strongest objections.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned in a speech to the
Canadian Parliament earlier in the week that leaders must not move
too quickly on the farm question, and Jacques Delors, who
represents the European Economic Community at the summit,
complained that the U.S. position on farm subsidies threatened to
``spoil the atmosphere'' of the talks.
   In an interview Saturday, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III
acknowledged that the United States was facing intense opposition
on the farm question and any breakthrough would be
``extraordinarily difficult.'' But he said the United States hopes
at least to get commitment that the problem will be a prime topic
for discussion during the current round of trade liberalization
talks.
   Baker said the United States believed it had agreement going
into the meetings for a final summit communique that would say the
$150 billion major countries spend annually on farm subsidies was
the ``foremost trade problem in the world'' and the countries hoped
to make progress in solving the problem at a midterm review of the
trade talks to be held in Montreal in December.
   ``We want to move the ball down the field a little bit, or at
least we don't want to be thrown for a loss,'' Baker said in an
interview on the Cable News Network show ``Evans & Novak.''
   A British official, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did not
think the elimination of all subsidies by the year 2000 was
practical, but she did believe the level of subsidies needed to be
trimmed.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher is definitely pushing for action so as to assure
farm subsidy disarmament rather than farm subsidy armament,'' the
official said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, the leader with the longest tenure among the
summit leaders, arrived at mid-afternoon Saturday followed an hour
later by Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, who is attending his
first summit.
   Mrs. Thatcher was made an honorary ``bencher,'' or senior lawyer
of the Law Society of Upper Canada.
   De Mita was taken immediately from the airport to an
enthusiastic welcome in the Italian section of Toronto, a city
which is home to 500,000 expatriate Italians and likes to boast
that it is the largest Italian community outside of Italy.
   ``I have the feeling I never left Italy when I look around
now,'' De Mita said in Italian to a crowd which needed no
translation.

   A Church of England envoy and an Iranian
official met Saturday in Tehran to discuss how to secure the
release of foreign hostages held in Lebanon, according to the
Iranian news media.
   Four British legislators are to arrive Sunday in Tehran, the
Iranian capital, on a similar mission.
   Iranian radio and television reports monitored in Nicosia said
the representative of Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury and
head of the Church of England, met with Mehdi Karrubi, deputy
speaker of Parliament.
   The envoy brought a letter from Runcie that ``expressed hope
that efforts for the release of Iranian and British hostages in
Lebanon will be fruitful,'' Tehran radio said.
   It did not name the representative, but in London the
archbishop's public affairs office said Friday that John Lyttle was
in Tehran representing Runcie. The statement said no further
information would be released until the visit ended.
   Tehran radio said Runcie's letter was addressed to Hashemi
Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, and called for
better relations between London and Tehran. It said the letter also
condemned Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the war with Iran. Iran
and Iraq have been fighting since September 1980.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency issued a report
denying a Church of England statement on Friday that said four
members of the British Parliament had been invited by Iran to
discuss improving ties.
   The agency quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying the British legislators ``had intimated an interest in
visiting Tehran and their offer simply has been accepted by Iran.''
   The lawmakers in the mission, expected to last three days, are
Cyril Townsend and Robert Hicks of the governing Conservative
Party, Thomas Clarke of the Labor Party and Lord Tordoff of the
Social Liberal Democrats.
   Eve Keatley, a spokeswoman for the Church of England, said
Friday the four were not going to negotiate the release of hostages
but to find ways to improve relations that might lead to such a
release.
   In London the Foreign Office stressed the British government was
not sponsoring the trip, which was organized through Runcie's
office.
   Eighteen Westerners, including nine Americans and three Britons,
have disappeared in Lebanon and it is believed most were kidnapped
by pro-Iranian militants.
   Terry Waite, the 49-year-old foreign affairs advisor to Runcie,
disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, during his fifth mission to
seek the release of foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
   The other missing Britons are John McCarthy, 31, a television
journalist, and Alec Collett, 64, a New York-based journalist.
   An Islamic extremist organization has claimed Collett was killed
but there has been no proof that he is dead.
   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In addition, the Iranian Embassy in Beirut said 17-19 Iranians
were believed to be held hostage in Lebanon.
   Diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran were reduced to
caretaker status a year ago but improved when the countries agreed
during talks in London last week to compensate each other for
damages to their diplomatic offices.
   The Iranian Embassy in London caught fire when British commandos
stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege. British diplomatic
buildings and the British Embassy in Iran were damaged by mobs in
1978, 1979, and 1980.

<HEAD>FBI Reportedly Made Four Probes Into Opponents of Central American
Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI conducted at least four investigations of
opponents of the Reagan Administration's Central American polices,
according to documents disclosed by a newspaper Saturday.
   The FBI investigated critics of Reagan administration policies
in Nicaragua in one probe and groups planning or staging
demonstrations against U.S. policy in Nicaragua in another, The
Boston Globe reported.
   The agency also conducted two investigations into opponents of
U.S. policies in El Salvador, the newspaper said. The probes were
captioned ``Salvadoran Leftist Activities in the United States''
and ``International Terrorism Investigation re: Leftist Guerrilla
Activities in El Salvador,'' the newspaper reported.
   The Globe said it obtained the documents under the Freedom of
Information Act.
   The FBI also conducted a separate investigation into members of
TecNica, a group that sends engineers to Nicaragua to work on small
scale development projects, the newspaper reported.
   Benjamin Linder, a 27-year-old American engineer who was killed
last year by contra forces, was working with a group affiliated
with TecNica.
   A House subcommittee last year looked into the possibility that
the FBI's interviews of TecNica volunteers returning from Nicaragua
amounted to an unwarranted investigation of the group.
   In addition to the investigations reported by The Globe, two
congressional committees and FBI Director William Sessions are
investigating the bureau's conduct in its probe of the Committee in
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
   The Globe asked the Center for Constitutional Rights, a public
interest lawyers group based in New York City, to analyze the
documents.
   David Lerner, a group lawyer, said the documents indicated that
the FBI's activity was even more widespread than previously
believed.
   ``The FBI's surveillance of opponents of all the Reagan's
Central America policies is pervasive. Anyone active in opposing
U.S. policy in all of Central America seems to have been a
target,'' the newspaper quoted Lerner as saying.
   But FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer denied that the bureau's
investigations are politically motivated.
   ``We don't go after people because of politics. We go after
people we suspect of committing a violation of U.S. law,'' the
paper quoted Schnitzer as saying.
   Ann Mari Buitrago of the Center for Constitutional Rights was
quoted as saying it is impossible to determine the number or extent
of the various FBI investigations because most of the documents
have been blacked out.
   One of the two Nicaraguan documents is captioned ``Nicaraguan
Terrorist Matters: International Terrorism _ Nicaragua,'' the
newspaper reported. It contains a report on a 1986 demonstration in
Chicago by Pledge of Resistance, a group that began protesting the
administration's pro-contra policies around 1985.
   In 1985, after being questioned by Congress, former FBI Director
William Webster admitted that FBI agents interviewed more than 100
U.S. citizens who had visited Nicaragua, as well as their friends,
landlords and employees, in some cases.
   Webster said then that some of those interviews may have been
requested by the CIA or the National Security Council.
   The FBI has maintained that its interviews were prompted by
counterintelligence concerns, such as fears that travelers may have
been asked by Nicaraguan officials to obtain information or spy on
the United States.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Saturday she'll do some ``vigorous batting'' at the seven-nation
economic summit, and aides said it will include pushing for ``farm
subsidy disarmament'' and debt relief for the poorest African
countries.
   At a ceremony in the paneled library of Toronto's Osgoode Hall
within hours of her arrival, Mrs. Thatcher was made an honorary
``bencher,'' or senior lawyer, of the Law Society of Upper Canada.
   Addressing the black-gowned members of the society, the
profession's governing body in the province of Ontario, Mrs.
Thatcher noted that the summit opening Sunday coincided with an
cricket match between Canadian graduates of Britain's ancient
Oxford and Cambridge universities.
   ``It won't be the only match in town,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``I
intend to do some fairly vigorous batting myself on a different
pitch.''
   Earlier, the British spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said
Mrs. Thatcher hoped the three-day summit would provide impetus for
farm subsidy reform at the December mid-term review in Montreal of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which regulates
international trade.
   Britain is seeking ``farm subsidy disarmament rather than farm
subsidy armament,'' said the Thatcher spokesman.
   ``I don't think we would regard the elimination of all subsidies
by the year 2000 as a practical solution but we ought to be moving
in that direction,'' said the spokesman.
   The United States wants all farm subsidies eliminated by that
date. But West European countries and Japan envisage only reducing
the subsidies.
   The spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher, as well as Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, would also be pushing for joint action on
relieving the debt burden of the poorest African countries.
   ``There should be a fairly specific agreement on African debt in
particular. We're looking for a firm commitment for action,'' he
said.
   Earlier, some Ontario lawyers protested granting Mrs. Thatcher
the ``bencher'' award, citing her refusal to impose tough sanctions
on South Africa.
   Clayton Ruby, one of the ``benchers'' who protested, said,
``This is a leader whose principal accomplishment has been to
frustrate Canada's attempts to end apartheid.''
   Laura Legge, acting head of the 191-year-old society, said only
three of the 44 ``benchers'' had protested, adding: ``Margaret
Thatcher, regardless of one's politics, is a woman who has been
highly successful.''
   In a her acceptance speech, Mrs. Thatcher said the right to live
under the rule of law will be the test of the Soviet Union's policy
of glasnost or openness.
   ``That will be the key test of whether the changes we are seeing
in the Communist societies are a true step toward democracy,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher is the 13th honorary ``bencher'' in the society's
history. They include Elizabeth, mother of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth II, and former Canadian Governor General Roland Michener.
   Britain is a major South African trading partner. Mrs. Thatcher
has refused to impose embargoes, saying they would hurt the black
majority most, encourage white resistance to change and cost jobs
in Britain and South Africa.
   Canada, which had scant economic ties with South Africa, has
been a leading proponent of tough measures by the Commonwealth, the
48-nation association of Britain and its former colonies.
   Earlier, Canadian officials and fur trappers lauded a British
decision not to insist fur coats carry warnings that the animals
may have been cruelly trapped.
   The government proposal, drawn up under pressure from
animal-rights activists, would have made retailers and
manufacturers put the labels in wild fox and lynx coats, but not in
minks.
   ``It is an especially Canadian victory _ kids, teachers,
parliamentarians got behind the trappers and native people and
brought political pressure to the highest level in Britain,'' said
Canadian Fur Institute spokesman Kirk Smith in an interview with
Toronto's Globe and Mail.
   The fur industry employs 100,000 Canadians, about half of them
native Indians and Inuit, and is worth more than $400 million a
year.
   Mrs. Thatcher appeared likely to discuss with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney a lucrative $10 billion contract to sell
Canada 10-12 nuclear-powered submarines, which France is also
trying to win. Mulroney is also hosting French President Francois
Mitterrand at the summit.
   Britain is seeking to sell the Canadians its Trafalgar-class
submarine, built with U.S. technology.
   Under an Anglo-American agreement, Britain must get U.S.
permission to pass on the technology to a third country. President
Reagan said last month he would not object, but Congress still must
give its approval.
   France would sell Canada its smaller, and cheaper, Rubis
Amethyste submarine, built entirely with French technology.

   Capt. James O. Houghton, commanding
officer of the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, has
died as a result of an automobile accident, police said. He was 45.
   Houghton was killed Thursday night when his car collided head-on
with a speeding car that veered into his lane, said Florida Highway
Patrol officer Venus North.
   Houghton did important research into the human body's reaction
to gravitational forces tolerance in high performance aircraft in
the early 1980s, according to Lt. Cmdr. Tom Fleischman.
   Houghton had commanded the laboratory at Pensacola Naval Air
Station since June 1985, and beginning July 1 was to take a new job
overseeing medical research and development at the Naval Medical
Command in Washington, D.C.
   Born in Littlefield, Texas, Houghton graduated from Union
College in Nebraska and earned his medical degree at Loma Linda
University in California. He interned at the Philadelphia Naval
Hospital in 1969 and was designated a naval flight surgeon the
following year.
   He served with the First and Third Marine Air Wings in Santa
Ana, Calif.; Da Nang, Vietnam; and Futenma, Okinawa, and had been
senior medical officer aboard the USS Oriskany and the USS Midway.
   Houghton conducted research in acceleration physiology at the
Naval Air Development Center in Warminister, Pa. He also worked as
a special assistant for aerospace medicine at the Naval Air Systems
Command in Washington, D.C.
   Funeral arrangements for Houghton, who was single, were not
immediately released by the Navy. He is survived by three brothers
and three sisters.

<HEAD>Reformers Say New Young Politburo Can Enact Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two advocates of reform, in interviews
published Saturday, said Hungary's new communist leaders can bring
about change because they are younger and not responsible for years
of stagnation.
   The new Communist Party Politburo has a ``striking generation
difference'' from the one headed by Janos Kadar, replaced as party
leader after 32 years in power, said Imre Pozsgay.
   Pozsgay was appointed to the Politburo at last month's national
party conference.
   He has called for dialogues with independent political groups
and in the intervew said more pluralism should accompany economic
reforms.
   ``That pluralism exists in socialism (communist society) is .. .
an indisputable fact of life,'' he said in an interview with the
Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag.
   Reszo Nyers, also elected to the Politburo last month, said in
an interview with the government newspaper Magyar Hirlap that it
was of ``serious political importance,'' that people ``enter or
re-enter the leadership who carry no direct responsibility for the
economic policy and general policy of the past 10-15 years.''
   Nyers the planner of Hungary's economic reforms in the late
1960s, was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparently
pushing too hard for more changes.
   Eight elderly Politburo members, including Kadar, 76, were swept
from power at the party conference, reducing the average age of the
11-member ruling body to 52.
   The interviews were published two days after police broke up a
demonstration in Budapest by Hungarians calling for the
rehabilitation of Imre Nagy, the leader during the 1956 revolt.
Nagy and many of his associates were executed in 1958. Soviet
troops put down the uprising.
   Pozsgay and Nyers did not mention the revolt in the interviews,
but Pozsgay said Hungarian history had to be reviewed factually all
the way back to 1945. The premier and new Communist Party leader,
Karoly Grosz, said last week he would appoint Pozsgay to head a
special committee to review Hungary's history of the past 15 to 20
years and take a long-term look at the coming 20 years.
   In a related development, Magyar Hirlap reported Saturday that
authorities had assured organizers of the Thursday demonstration
that there would be no interference as long as the protesters were
not anti-regime.
   The article was the first detailed official account of events
dealing with the Nagy demonstration.
   Magyar Hirlap said authorities had contacted organizers in
advance and told them no steps would be taken to disturb ``their
expression of their respect toward the dead.''
   The newspaper said a memorial event at a Budapest cemetery where
Nagy is believed to be buried was held ``without any disturbance of
public order'' by some 400 people.
   But it said 15 people were detained during the afternoon
demonstration in downtown Budapest and were released by 10 p.m.
   Witnesses had reported, however, that some 400 peopled moved on
to the Hungarian television building where they were dispersed by
riot police with truncheons.

   When 18-year-old Joely Kragh leaves home
for college this fall, she'll pack what she calls an unexpected but
reassuring high school graduation present: a .38-caliber pistol.
   ``I was shocked at first. I hadn't expected it,'' Ms. Kragh said
Friday of the gift from her parents.
   She likes the idea of having a handgun in her sports car while
she drives 250 miles alone on the freeways between Fresno and the
University of California at Irvine, where she plans to study
biological sciences.
   ``It's more reassuring to know it's there. It's like having a
security blanket,'' she added.
   Her mother, Geri Kragh, said she first thought of buying a
handgun for her oldest daughter after seeing a television talk show
program on date-rape, murders and violence on college campuses. The
stories were similar to what Mrs. Kragh, who attends Fresno State
University, reads in the campus newspaper.
   ``I just want her to have the option to have the protection if
she wants it,'' Mrs. Kragh said.
   Her daughter plans to attend self-defense classes in college.
But at 5-feet-2-inches tall and weighing about 90 pounds, she's
doubtful she could wrestle off a large attacker.
   ``I originally kind of approached it as a joke and in fact
didn't tell my husband until the night we bought it,'' Mrs. Kragh
recalled. Larry Kragh, a former reserve sheriff's deputy, mulled
over the idea as the couple sat in the car outside a sports store.
   ``The more he thought about it, the more he thought it would be
a good idea,'' Mrs. Kragh said.
   ``I didn't think my dad would go for it,'' Ms. Kragh said as she
prepared for a post-graduation vacation cruise in the Carribean.
She graduated from Hoover High School on Tuesday.
   She has completed a gun safety class, where she said she was by
far the youngest person at the firing range.
   The gun is registered, and she plans to carry it unloaded and in
a container to avoid the need for the license required for carrying
concealed weapons, Mrs. Kragh said.
   Obtaining such a license is extremely difficult, and applicants
have to state a reason, said Fresno Police Lt. Lynn Button. ``It
has to be a good and sound reason for personal safety,'' Button
said.

   Mozambique's anti-Marxist rebels on
Saturday claimed that government and Zimbabwean troops fired on
civilians waiting for Red Cross aid, killing 17 people and wounding
65.
   According to a statement issued in Lisbon by the Mozambican
National Resistance, the attack took place Tuesday in the town of
Molima 17 miles from the city of Chemba. It said the attack was
witnessed by eight Red Cross staff members.
   The statement signed by the rebels' Lisbon spokesman Manuel
Frank also said that on June 8 there was a similar attack on
civilians who were waiting at a rural Red Cross outpost for medical
and food supplies. It gave no further details.
   Zimbabwe has troops in Mozambique helping the government battle
the guerrillas.
   Both Zimbabwe and Mozambique claim South Africa is helping the
rebels. South Africa has denied the allegations.

   With the sounds of Delta Blues in the air, more
than 1,000 transplanted Mississippians gathered for a down-home
fish fry and picnic in Central Park Saturday.
   Four propane cookers fried up 150 pounds of catfish fillets and
thousands of hush puppies for the Ninth Annual Way Up North in
Mississippi Picnic.
   ``It's a slice of what's very common in Mississippi every
weekend _ people having outdoor parties,'' said Tim James, who
moved to New York 10 years ago from Columbus, Miss. ``If the
buildings weren't here, it could be somebody's farm.''
   ``Primarily it's a fun thing,'' said Mississippi Lt. Gov. Brad
Dye, as he ate catfish and bragged about its freshness.
   Mississippi exported about 2 million pounds of pond-raised,
grain-fed catfish last year. And catfish farming in the Delta is
the fastest growing industry in the state, said Jeff Giachelli,
director of marketing for the state Department of Agriculture.
   Most people came for the camaraderie and brought their own box
lunches to spread out on blankets under the trees as they listened
to Roosevelt ``Booby'' Barnes play his slide guitar.
   But Eleanor Roberts of Manhattan, who has no connection wih
Mississippi, said unabashedly that she came for the free catfish,
courtesy of Country Skillet Catfish Company of Isola, and hush
puppies, donated by the Mississippi Hush Puppy Company.
   ``It's like a cross between a perch and a butterfish, very
sweet,'' said Ms. Roberts who fretted that there might not be any
left by the time she got to the head of the long line.
   In addition to the food, there were the universities, all trying
to outdo each other in giving away the best souvenirs _ football
schedules, embossed pencils, bumper stickers, fans and lapel pins.
   The University of Mississippi table was set up next to
Mississippi State's.
   ``Up here we sort of mix together and put aside the feelings of
combat,'' said Charles Weatherly of Ripley, Miss., a former
president of the MSU alumni association. ``We are coming together
to promote the state.''
   At the Mississippi University for Women's table, alumnae spoke
about the admission of men early this decade after a man went all
the way to the Supreme Court to get into ``the W's'' nursing school.
   How many men now attend the W?
   ``Too many,'' replied Kay Cobb, former president of the alumnae
association.
   There were not many black people at the picnic, but those who
attended had good things to say about the state.
   ``If the state was like it is now when I finished college
(Alcorn State 1935) I'd have stayed there,'' said Walter Harbour of
Queens, who was born in Indianola, Miss., 78 years ago.
   Lionel Hampton, the jazz musician, who called himself an adopted
Mississippian, said he was the first black on the campus of Ole
Miss back in 1950, although he was performing, not studying.
   ``I never got such ovation, before or since,'' Hampton said.
   In a brief ceremony, the Mississippi Society of New York, which
organized the picnic, and the Mississippi Printing Co. of
Greenwood, which helped pay for it, presented a $5,000 check to New
York's Parks Commissioner Henry Stern.
   Stern noted that the Mississippi picnic was such a good idea
that it is being copied by Louisiana, which has scheduled a picnic
in the park July 16.

   English rowdies rampaged through
a bar late Saturday and police arrested about two dozen more German
and British soccer fans in Frankfurt in a third straight night of
disturbances.
   Police reported about 300 English and German hoodlums, including
16 right-wing extremists, were arrested or placed under preventive
detention in three cities in the latest round of clashes and
vandalism by soccer fans.
   Police rounded up about two dozen English and German soccer fans
Saturday night several hours after the Soviet Union's 3-1 soccer
victory over England.
   Following the match, hundreds of police patrolled Frankfurt's
main train station where disturbances had broken out late Friday.
   Some English rowdies were arrested after they ransacked a bar
where they had been drinking, according to police.
   They said groups of Germans were picked up for public
drunkenness and because it appeared they were preparing to attack
English soccer fans.
   Frankfurt police Saturday afternoon said that in addition to 88
arrests late Friday and early Saturday, 12 other brawling fans had
been arrested just before the game between England and the Soviets.
   ``I don't know if they were English or German. We had a mix of
both before,'' police spokesman Manfred Fuellhardt said in a
telephone interview.
   In Gelsenkirchen, 50 known West German troublemakers were taken
into temporary custody as a preventive measure before the start of
the Netherlands-Ireland soccer match, according to officials.
   The Dutch won the game 1-0 and no incidents were reported.
   Frankfurt police spokesman Kurt Kraus said 16 right-wing
extremists arrested in Frankfurt early Saturday ``are members of
the notorious Eagle Front fan club.'' The Eagle Front is a group of
young fans who often have tatoos of neo-Nazi emblems.
   Dozens of those arrested were English fans on their
self-proclaimed ``Invasion of Germany 1988.'' Many of the fans were
infuriated that their team already had been eliminated from the
championships even before the match with the Soviets.
   The violence surrounding the European soccer championships
already has led to more than 700 arrests in five German cities and
forced cancellation of the English clubs' bid to rejoin European
tournament play next season.
   In the Bavarian capital of Munich, police arrested 120 fans, all
West German except for one English fan, for brawls that broke out
as the host team beat Spain 2-0 Friday in Olympic Stadium.
   Late Friday night, groups of English, West German and Italian
rowdies got into isolated scuffles near the train station, police
said.
   Police charged at and dispersed dozens of the drunken fans,
officials said.
   ``They (the English) came out of a bar looking for trouble and
they got it,'' said Peter Staskiewecz, another police spokesman.
   The English were arrested for throwing beer bottles, brawling
with tavern patrons and attacking two motorists at red lights near
the train station, Frankfurt police said. The drivers were slightly
injured and their cars damaged, police said.
   The brawls have forced many Frankfurt residents to stay away
from areas near the main train station and the Sachsenhausen
district.
   ``English Fans Fight their Way through Sachsenhausen,'' said the
front-page headline in Saturday's editions of the Frankfurter Neue
Presse daily.
   Police on Friday said the body of a 29-year-old Irish soccer fan
was found floating in the Main River running through Frankfurt.
   Police said the victim apparently drowned while intoxicated and
that there was no indication of foul play. The body was discovered
Thursday night.
   The soccer-related clashes broke out shortly after the two-week
European championships started on June 10. Most of those arrested
have been released after spending the night in jail.
   The violence by English fans already has prompted England to
withdraw its application for readmission to European club soccer
tournaments next season.
   English clubs were banned after the 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy
in Belgium in which 39 people, most of them Italians, were killed
in violence sparked by rampaging English soccer fans.

   Michael Dukakis, expressing growing confidence
about his chances to win the presidency, told Texas Democrats
Saturday to ignore predictions he can't carry the South. ``Vamos a
ganar,'' he told them. ``We're going to win.''
   Dukakis brought Texas Democratic Convention delegates to their
feet Saturday, cheering, first in Spanish, then in English, ``We're
going to win.''
   In a speech to the convention, Dukakis said, ``If anyone tells
that we can't win in the South, or that we can't win in the West,
or that we can't win in the great state of Texas, don't you believe
it.
   ``You tell them that we're going to win.''
   Texas is the adopted home state of Republican George Bush, but
Dukakis refuses to concede the state to the vice president.
   One order of business at the state convention was to complete
allocation of delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
   Dukakis edged Jesse Jackson in the Texas primary on March 8, but
in a separate system of caucuses in Texas, Jackson gained ground.
According to The Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis could
expect support from 76 Texas delegates, while 71 would back
Jackson. Another 64 were uncommitted, including delegates
previously pledged to Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   However, those figures could shift as the delegate selection
moves through its final stages.
   Gore planned to ask his delegates to switch to Dukakis on Monday.
   One of Dukakis' strengths in Texas is his support in the
Hispanic community, stemming in part from his fluent Spanish.
   Before he flew to the Democratic convention he was in San
Antonio where he delivered a eulogy at the funeral of William
Velasquez, founder of the Southwest Voter Registration and
Education Project, an organization credited with getting hundreds
of thousands of Hispanics registered to vote.
   Velasquez, who died of cancer on Wednesday, had planned to
introduce Dukakis to the state convention.
   ``He was our friend,'' Dukakis told mourners who packed St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church. ``We learned from him, we were
inspired by him, we will never forget him.''
   Shifting to Spanish, Dukakis said, ``Willie was a nuts-and-bolts
political leader, but his commitment went deeper than that _ to the
very soul of this country, to the very heart of our democratic
system. ... His goal was not to change the faces of those we elect
to public service, but to improve the quality of public service
itself.''
   In his speech to the Houston convention, Dukakis recalled the
1960 presidential election when Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy
picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate.
   ``Today, as in 1960, we're in a battle for the economic future
of America and now, as then, the old ways simply will not do.''
   He ridiculed Bush's criticism of his Harvard ties, saying,
``Some people say this election is about where we went to college.
I say it's about whether our children will have the chance to go to
college.''
   Dukakis said the Democrats were the party of working Americans,
of families, of progress, of strength and of the future.
   ``We're going to win because we're America's party,'' he said.
   From Texas, Dukakis flew to Montgomery, Ala., for a meeting with
former Gov. George C. Wallace.
   After a brief session at Wallace's suburban Montgomery home, the
two men spoke with reporters in front of the house.
   ``I appreciate him coming to Alabama,'' said the former
governor, who is hard of hearing and uses a wheelchair.
   Dukakis shook hands with Wallace and promised, ``I'll be back,
I'll be back.''
   The Massachusetts governor then attended a rally at a hotel in
downtown Montgomery.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Opposition leaders said Saturday
they were puzzled by President Leslie Manigat's abrupt dismissal of
his military chief, but they applauded the demonstration of
civilian authority over the armed forces.
   There were reports that the fired military commander, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, was under house arrest.
   Namphy was president of the three-man junta that ruled Haiti
from the time dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in 1986
until Manigat was sworn in Feb. 7 following an election in January.
   A close associate of Namphy said the general is under house
arrest at his home in Bon Repos, 15 miles north of Port-au_Prince.
   The associate, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
told The Associated Press that ``some close friends went to see him
(Namphy) today. They were turned back. Nobody is allowed in or out.
The house is heavily guarded.''
   Youths chanting, ``Down with Manigat, long live the army!'' put
up tire barracades Friday night on the main east-west highway at
Petit Goave, about 30 miles west of the capital of Port-au-Prince.
   Soldiers dismantled the barricades Saturday and arrested one of
about 20 youths who began demonstrating in the town, Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
   Several rounds of gunfire were heard early Saturday from the
army barracks of Petionville, a suburb of the capital. Radio Haiti
Inter reported an explosion near the Champ de Mars Plaza, adjacent
to the presidential palace.
   There was no other information immediately available on the
gunshots or explosion.
   Businesses opened as usual in the capital, and streets were calm.
   ``Who knows what is really happening?'' asked Rev. Antoine
Adrien, a Roman Catholic priest and co-leader of the civic group
Honor and Respect for the Constitution.
   ``We were told Wednesday that the army and the executive were on
the best of terms, and now this bombshell,'' he said. ``We can only
rejoice if ... the military has submitted to civilian authority.''
   A presidential communique Friday night said Manigat had retired
Namphy and two other members of the general staff, Brig. Gens. Carl
Michel Nicolas and Wilthan Lherisson. Manigat promoted Col. Morton
Gousse to general and named him provisional military commander.
   The communique said the generals had defied Manigat's decision
Wednesday to rescind an order by Namphy transferring and retiring
several high-ranking officers.
   Among those Namphy attempted to transfer was Col. Jean-Claude
Paul, who was indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a
grand jury in Miami.
   Manigat, apparently siding with Paul, said the order was
unconstitutional because it was done without consulting him.
   ``The dismissal of Namphy seems to have enforced Manigat's
authority,'' said Sylvio Claude, leader of the opposition Christian
Democratic Party. ``But, politically, we must wait and see whether
Manigat can control the army he has apparently betrayed.''
   Paul commands the 700-man Dessalines Barracks, whose soldiers
were blamed for widespread violence against voters that left more
than 30 people dead and forced cancellation of independently
administered general elections Nov. 29.
   Manigat was declared the winner of Jan. 17 elections organized
by the junta. Manigat was considered the army's candidate in the
election.
   ``It is too soon to say whether there has been a reinforcement
of civilian authority over the military because in any case Manigat
must still make concessions to certain sectors of the army,'' said
Victor Benoit, co-leader of the leftist Congress of Democratic
Forces.
   It was unclear why Namphy ordered the transfer and whether the
order represented a power struggle within the army or was linked to
the U.S. charges against Paul, who has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``The Reagan administration asked Namphy to get rid of Paul. But
Manigat, it seems, has gotten rid of Namphy,'' Claude said.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Gerard Latortue called the removal ``a
strictly internal matter.''

<HEAD>Congressman: Cuba Intelligence Compromised</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government is re-evaluating two decades
worth of intelligence obtained from Cuba after discovering that
many sources were double agents working for the Communist
government there, a congressman said Saturday.
   ``A large number of our intelligence activities (in Cuba)
involved individuals who apparently were double agents over the
past 20 years,'' U.S. Rep. Dan Mica, chairman of the House
International Operations Subcommittee, told The Associated Press in
an interview.
   ``There is great concern.''
   Mica said the government also is investigating romantic
encounters between Marine guards at the U.S. Interests Section in
Havana and Cuban women, but he added that guards probably didn't
betray U.S. secrets.
   The congressman also disclosed that an investigation of U.S.
embassies in other East bloc countries indicated there may have
been as many as 500 attempts to use women to entice Marine guards
into compromising security.
   Mica said a Cuban defector raised the claims that U.S.
intelligence in Cuba had been undermined. He declined to identify
the defector or give other details.
   ``As we were starting to check it, the scope just became
astounding,'' Mica said. ``There is now in process a major review
of what did we get the last 20 years, who did we get it from, what
did we do with it, did it have an effect on foreign policy, did we
advise our military and our allies improperly.''
   Mica said the Central Intelligence Agency, the Naval
Investigative Service, State Department intelligence and the
General Accounting Office have been investigating Cuban
intelligence for several months.
   ``We're still trying to assess the damage,'' Mica said.
   Congressional investigators haven't publicized the probes, but
Mica said he agreed to discuss them following disclosures last week
that four Marine guards at the Interests Section in Havana
fraternized with Cuban women.
   Mica was in Tampa for a political forum sponsored by the Florida
Education Association-United, where he appeared with three other
Democrats who are seeking the party's nomination to run for the
U.S. Senate.
   Mica, who went to Moscow to look into Soviet bugging of the U.S.
Embassy and the sex-for-secrets scandal involving U.S. Marine
guards there last year, said he pushed then for a probe of embassy
security in other unfriendly nations.
   ``We discovered what appeared to be a pattern and practice of
Soviet bloc countries targeting Marine guards. Some 500 cases
around the world came to our attention that never had had the
appropriate follow-up,'' Mica said.
   The State Department and the Marines have played down the report
of 500 cases of possible wrongdoing since the Moscow investigation
led to only two convictions, one on minor counts. The Marines said
many of the reported infractions were minor, such as curfew
violations and telephone misuse.
   The five-term congressman said he hopes to visit the American
diplomatic mission in Havana in the next week or two. The United
States does not have full diplomatic relations with Cuba, but the
two countries exchanged interest sections that carry out diplomatic
and immigration functions.
   Mica said there are 23 American staff members at the mission and
about 90 Cuban nationals employed for clerical and other support
services.
   ``The way it's structured, it's very difficult to do the
appropriate work in any kind of minimal intelligence-gathering
without secure areas being entered by Cuban nationals,'' said Mica.
   The State Department plans to set up an annex in South Miami to
handle visas and other clerical functions and allow a reduction in
the number of foreign nationals in the Havana mission and U.S.
embassies in other Latin American nations, Mica said.

<HEAD>Ortega Says Economic Reforms Necessary to Defend Revolution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday
defended economic reforms enacted by his government last week and
said the measures were necessary to strengthen the leftist
revolution.
   Facing a sometimes hostile audience of 1,000 people in an open
meeting, Ortega insisted his reforms were based in ``an economy of
a socialist nature.''
   The government on Wednesday devalued the cordoba, Nicaragua's
currency, nearly doubled gasoline prices and enacted a general pay
raise of 30 percent.
   Ortega last week said the government would lift wage and price
controls in hopes of stimulating productivity.
   Two unions controlled by the opposition Socialist Party on
Friday demanded 600 percent wage hikes to keep up with inflation
and the primary school teachers guild said it also will pursue a
salary increase.
   Explaining the measures to the crowd, Ortega said ``the greatest
problem is provoked by Yankee aggression.''
   The United States has maintained a three-year-old economic
embargo against Nicaragua and supported a more than six-year rebel
insurgency against the leftist Sandinista regime. The Reagan
administration recently has been discussing new military aid to the
rebels, known as Contras.
   The Nicaraguan government estimates the civil war has caused $3
billion in damage to the economy.
   Several people attending the meeting, one in a series the
government terms ``Face the People,'' complained the 30 percent
general pay raise failed to make up for rising food costs prompted
by the reforms.
   ``The problem here is hunger and nothing else,'' a health worker
told the president.
   Ortega called on his audience to mount ``a great
political-ideological effort'' to ensure the success of the
measures.
   ``We are convinced that we are going to surmount this historical
moment and will have better conditions to attend to all of the
demands of Nicaraguan workers,'' Ortega said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said Saturday that NATO and the Warsaw Pact should both
strive toward eliminating their capacities to launch surprise
attacks on each other.
   Speaking in an interview on the West German radio station
Deutsche Welle, Genscher said the Warsaw Pact must be prepared to
``undertake asymmetrical disarmament steps'' because of its
advantage over NATO in tanks and other conventional forces.
   ``Conventional imbalances make up the central problem for
European security,'' Genscher said.
   But he suggested NATO itself should also be prepared to make
sacrifices.
   ``It is crucial that we now concentrate on creating conventional
forces stability and ... on eliminating both sides' capabilities
for surprise attacks,'' Genscher said.
   Genscher's remarks came a week after he praised a new Soviet
proposal for a three-stage plan to reduce NATO's and the Warsaw
Pact's conventional forces. Some U.S. officials see the proposal as
Soviet propaganda move.

<TEXT>
   The Japanese government announced Saturday, on
the eve of the seven-nation economic summit here, that it is
absolving 17 of the poorest Third World countries of $1 billion in
debt over the next five years.
   The initiative followed an announcement June 14 that Japan was
more than doubling its overseas development aid to at least $50
billion in the next five years.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, chief cabinet councillor on external
affairs, told a briefing that Japan has extended $5.5 billion in
development loans over the past decade to the 17 countries
involved, which are mostly in Africa but also include Burma and
Bangladesh.
   He said because of legal constraints, Japan is not writing off
the loans.
   But over the next five years, the $1 billion due in capital and
interest repayments will be waived. The sum is part of the $50
billion package.
   Kunihiro said the decision does not preclude giving additional
aid to the poor nations.
   Japan has been criticized for apportioning less of its gross
national product in foreign aid than other major industrialized
countries.
   But Kunihiro said Japan had increased its assistance to $7.5
billion last year, compared with $8.6 billion in aid provided by
the United States, and added: ``If we increase our (aid) at this
rate for the next one or two years, it may soon be higher than the
United States.''
   Kunihiro did not provide a list of the 17 countries.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Toxic Waste Dumped at Bangkok Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Saturday that the
capital's river port has been used for years as an international
garbage dump for toxic waste.
   The English-language daily ``The Nation'' said thousands of
unclaimed, falsely-marked containers of toxic waste believed to
have been shipped from Singapore were being kept at Kloeng Toey
port.
   Tests done by the National Environment Board revealed the tanks
contained toxic chemical waste that could not be buried for fear it
would contaminate groundwater and not decompose for 20 or 30 years,
the Bangkok-based newspaper said.
   Port officials, the Industry Ministry and the National
Environment Board were searching for ways to dispose of the
unclaimed barrels, the newspaper said.
   Thai government officials could not immediately be reached for
comment Saturday.
   The Nation said fears were aroused after toxic waste began
leaking out of 360 tanks that were delivered at the port about four
years ago. Port authorities then alerted the National Enviroment
Board.
   The newspaper quoted port authorities as saying that in the
past, toxic waste was sent back to Singapore if the exporter's name
and the Thai receiver's address were known.
   Metal and plastic tanks labeled as liquid fertilizer or chemical
substances had been arriving regularly at Klong Toey port from
Singapore since 1978, the newspaper said.
   All cargo unloaded at the dock is supposed to be picked up
withing 75 days. If no one claims it the port can confiscate and
auction it off. Thai law restricts the opening of arriving cargo by
port officials.
   The Nation quoted Singapore's Counsellor Toh Hock Ghim as saying
his embassy had never been informed of the problem and that no Thai
authorities had ever asked help in tracking down the consigners of
the shipments.

   Jesse Jackson stood in a Republican's
cornfield and prayed for rain Saturday.
   ``We call upon you because we know that you have the power to
bring forth sunshine and bring forth the rain,'' Jackson prayed in
a drought-stricken cornfield on Dan Mau's 1,400-acre farm in nearby
Chatham.
   Mau, a registered Republican, said he had not decided whom he
would support for president but added that Jackson, a Democrat,
made a good impression.
   ``I think he ought to have some influence on what happens in the
next few years,'' he said.
   Later, Jackson related his farm visit to the audience of more
than 1,000 people at the Illinois Democratic convention at Sangamon
State University and declared there should be a national moratorium
on farm foreclosures.
   ``No one should lose his land because of this drought,'' Jackson
said before leading a group prayer for rain and peace.
   Although Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has garnered more
than enough delegates to be the party's nominee, Jackson urged
those gathered Saturday to endorse his presidential candidacy
instead.
   ``There is somebody running from Massachusetts with platitudes,
and there is somebody from Illinois running with ideas,'' said
Jackson, who has a home in Chicago and founded the Chicago-based
civil rights group, Operation PUSH.
   ``I stood with you to make a better and stronger Illinois ...
you didn't meet me through some commercial,'' said Jackson, who
disclosed that he is inviting Polish Solidarity Union founder Lech
Walesa and South African anti-apartheid activist Winnie Mandela to
the Democratic National Convention.
   State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced immediately afterward
that he would vote for Jackson on the first ballot at the national
convention in Atlanta next month.
   Cosentino had been a delegate for Sen. Paul Simon, but was
released along with other Simon delegates to vote as he wishes in
Atlanta after the senator from Illinois dropped out.
   ``As long as he decided to get out of the race, I'm not going to
turn my back on another man from Illinois,'' Cosentino said.
   Cosentino said Jackson deserves to be supported for president or
vice president.
   Jackson, in a news conference with reporters at the convention,
refused to say whether he wants to be named as Dukakis' running
mate.
   ``My constituents _ nearly seven million voters _ has earned
consideration,'' he said.
   Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer introduced Jackson as one of the
nation's strongest Democrats.
   ``He earned the right to be whatever he wants to be _ president,
vice president, whatever,'' Sawyer said.
   State Democrats were meeting in Springfield to adopt a platform,
name three candidates for University of Illinois trustee positions,
and nominate electors for the Electoral College.
   Later, Jackson attended a gathering in a park in Philadelphia to
celebrate black heritage.
   ``We're going to the White House,'' he told the group. ``Michael
Dukakis has never lived in public housing, so he probably couldn't
adjust...I want to go back to living in public housing. I want to
live in the White House.''

   A batch of rock 'n' roll memorabilia featuring
Elvis Presley's underpants and Michael Jackson's stage hat fetched
more than half a million dollars at auction Saturday.
   A lot of Presley's personal items, including a pair of
Munsingwear maroon nylon underpants, an electric razor, hairbrush
and black socks, went for $605, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's, the auctioneer.
   A Gibson model J-200 guitar Presley used in the late 1950s and
early '60s sold for $27,500, the top price paid at the auction, Ms.
Stewart said.
   Jackson's autographed fedora was sold for $4,125.
   About 30 bidders and more than 300 spectators gathered to see
226 lots of memorabilia sold for a total of $533,477, Ms. Stewart
said. The T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS
Research received $127,600 of the proceeds, she said.
   Top-priced items included a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
used by Jimi Hendrix that sold for $15,400; Hendrix's silk Neru
jacket with handpainted eyes, face and other psychedelic details
that went for $13,200, and a gold ring of Presley's that attracted
a top bid of $14,300, she said.
   The Elvis Presley Museum in Nashville spent $9,900 for an
autographed bustier worn by Madonna in her music video for ``Gonna
Dress You Up In My Love,'' she said.
   Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics for ``I Want You'' went for
$8,800, a John Lennon gray wool suit fetched $3,300 and one of
Lennon's guitar straps sold for $8,250, she said.
   A pair of high-top white and gray leather sneakers autographed
by Jam Master J and Joseph ``Run'' Simmons of Run DMC sold for
$1,870, she said.
   The sneakers, which brought four times the projected price, were
purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe of New York.
   Hard Rock America, which stocks its 10 restaurants with rock
memorabilia, paid $137,973 for 49 lots, Ms. Stewart said.
   Other items auctioned included a group of Avalon Ballroom
concert posters featuring groups such as Canned Heat, Iron
Butterfly, The Doors and Jefferson Airplane that went for $3,850,
and a set of Huey Lewis' golf clubs that sold for $2,475, Ms.
Stewart said.

<HEAD>Reports: Lehman May Have Warned Target Of Probe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Defense Probe Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. may
have tipped off a friend that he was a target in the federal
investigation of alleged widespread fraud and corruption in Defense
Department procurement, according to published reports.
   The Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post reported in their
Sunday editions that federal investigations are pursuing
information that Lehman may have warned Melvyn R. Paisley, former
assistant Navy secretary who later became a successful defense
consultant, that his telephones were being tapped in a massive
probe of defense contracting fraud.
   The Post quoted law enforcement sources as saying that questions
about Lehman focus on whether he may have obstructed justice by
warning Paisley that his activities might be the subject of a
federal investigation.
   The Times, however, quoted sources as saying the information is
``nothing close'' to strong enough at this point for considering
charges against Lehman.
   The Times cited an unidentified source as saying the alleged
warning, signs of which came to agents through a wiretap, took
place before Lehman left office in April, 1987. But the Post quoted
one source as saying the alleged warning occurred after both men
had left government service.
   Henry E. Hudson, U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., who is
coordinating the investigation, responded with a terse ``no
comment'' when asked by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, whether
Lehman was a target of the fast-developing federal inquiry by the
FBI, believed to be the largest in the nation's defense contracting
history.
   The Times said Lehman, at his McLean, Va., home, refused
Saturday to answer questions about the probe, saying: ``It would be
inappropriate of me to comment on an ongoing investigation.'' He
said he would break his silence ``after the investigation is
completed.''
   Lehman and Paisley have been close associates for years. As an
official of the Boeing Co., Paisley hired Lehman as a consultant
nearly a decade ago. Lehman then recruited Paisley to become
assistant Navy secretary in 1981, and he served as Navy research
chief until 1987.
   Law enforcement sources have identified Paisley as a central
figure in the probe of Pentagon contracting. His home and office
were searched Tuesday. Sources familiar with the investigation have
said authorities bugged his consulting office and tapped his
telephone.
   The nationwide federal investigation, which involves private
defense consultants, Pentagon officials and defense contractors,
was made public last Tuesday as agents searched 38 offices and
homes in an effort to find evidence of bribes and gratuities paid
for disclosure of confidential contracting information. The
information allegedly gave recipients a competitive edge in
submitting bids for contracts.

<HEAD>School Where Recruit Drowned To Reopen Next Week With New Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy Rescue Swimmer School at
Pensacola, Fla., which was closed after a recruit drowned in March,
will reopen Monday with new instructors and safety guidelines, a
congressional aide said Saturday.
   John Fink, an aide to Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., said the Navy
would announce the reopening Monday.
   Navy officials in Pensacola did not return telephone calls
Saturday.
   The Navy closed the school March 29 after an investigation into
the March 2 drowning of Lee Mirecki, of Appleton, showed Mirecki
had been held underwater in the school's training pool.
   A medical examiner testified at a hearing earlier this month
that Mirecki, 19, died from heart failure caused by the ``sheer
terror'' of being held underwater against his will.
   Five instructors face possible court-martial on charges of
involuntary manslaughter in Mirecki's death, and the officer in
charge of the school faces court-martial for dereliction of duty.
   Fink said one of the school's new guidelines will prohibit
instructors from physically handling students in the water.
Instead, students will practice rescue techniques and combat skills
on each other while instructors supervise, he said.
   Fink said the reopening announcement originally was scheduled
for Friday but was delayed because of a question about the wording
of one new guideline.
   The announcement planned for Friday stated that ``unauthorized
exercises such as `sharks and daisies' will be prohibited,'' Fink
said. He said he asked Lt. Cmdr. Michael McGuire, a congressional
liaison officer, about the phrasing because it was the Navy's first
known reference to an exercise being unauthorized.
   After consulting his superiors, McGuire said the announcement
would be withheld until Monday, Fink said.
   According to testimony at the hearing, Mirecki died during a
``sharks and daisies'' exercise in which students swim face down
while instructors roam the side of the pool, periodically jumping
on students to simulate attacks by potential drowning victims.
Rescue students are expected to free themselves from the attacker.
   The new guidelines also will address how to handle requests to
drop a class, Fink said.
   Testimony at the hearing revealed that Mirecki screamed the
letters DOR, which stand for ``drop on request,'' but instructors
forced him back into the pool to continue the exercise.
   Under the school's rules, he should have been permitted to drop
the class, officials said.
   Meanwhile, The Appleton-Post Crescent reported Saturday that two
sources, who requested anonymity, said a recommendation on whether
to court-martial the six men charged in Mirecki's death has been
delivered to Rear Adm. David Morris. He has 120 days to dismiss the
charges, discipline the six or order military trials.
   The newspaper said a decision is expected in July.

<TEXT>
   USAir has filed suit against its 4,000 flight
attendants and their union, claiming their refusal to work overtime
during the Memorial Day weekend cost the airline $1.1 million in
canceled flights and other costs.
   ``The reason we filed was so this illegal job action would not
be repeated,'' USAir spokesman David Shipley said Friday. ``We have
the Fourth of July holiday coming up.''
   USAir claims the job action violated the federal Railway Labor
Act. Officials of the Association of Flight Attendants said they
did nothing wrong and said the union's contract with USAir
maintains flight attendants do not have to work more than 85 hours
a month.
   The suit, filed recently in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh,
asks the court to prohibit the employees from repeating the recent
action. It also seeks $1.1 million in damages.
   The airline said it was forced to cancel 179 flights,
inconveniencing about 10,000 passengers. It said it lost about $1
million in revenue and paid $100,000 to accommodate passengers
affected by the cancellations and to pay flight crews who already
had been scheduled for work.

<HEAD>Man Released From Cuban Prison Awaits Trial in Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent five years in a
Cuban prison after being convicted of air piracy was released and
flown to Florida, where he now awaits trial for the same crime.
   Fidel Castro's government had sentenced Robert Patrick Richter
to 20 years in prison. The early release was credited to the
efforts of Richter's father, prominent Chicago-area businessman
John Richter, who also arranged for a twin-engine private plane to
fly his son from Cuba to Miami.
   Robert Richter, 31, was arrested Wednesday by the FBI as he
stepped off the plane. A federal magistrate in Fort Lauderdale
released him on bond Friday.
   Richter's father and the FBI declined to discuss how the deal
was struck with Cuban authorities. But the FBI said the U.S.
government was not involved in the negotiations.
   ``This is not an everyday common occurence,'' said FBI agent
Gene Frey. ``I'm happy that he's back.''
   Richter allegedly boarded an Air Florida jetliner at Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on July 7, 1983, and
used a phony bomb to force the plane's crew to take him to Cuba,
the FBI said.
   Richter, who often had spoken of his interest in communism and
Cuba, arrived there at an inopportune time. Less than 24 hours
earlier, the U.S. government said it received word from Castro's
government that Cuba would crack down on hijackers and that any sky
pirates landing on the island could expect 50 years in prison.
   Looking gaunt and pale when he appeared before U.S. Magistrate
Lurana Snow, Richter pleaded innocent to a charge of air piracy
contained in a 1987 indictment. He was accompanied by his father,
who posted a $250,000 personal surety bond and promised that his
son would work in one of his businesses while awaiting trial.
   After his release, Richter refused to talk about conditions in
Cuban prison and would say only that he was ``very happy to be
back'' in the United States.
   ``The hijacking was a great mistake, a bad error in judgment
that we will explain to the court at a later date,'' said Richter's
attorney, Edward Swan. Swan said he would ask for a psychiatric
evaluation of Richter.

<HEAD>House That Was a Steal May Turn Big Profit, Authorities Say</HEAD>

   A salesman accused of faking documents
to buy an $855,000 home in this exclusive community without making
a down payment or any monthly payments stands to make $500,000 from
its sale, authorities say.
   John Williams, 30, faces felony counts of using bogus tax
returns, income statements and identification to acquire a mortgage
to buy the home, but a prosecutor says Williams is the legal owner.
   ``If it is in his name, I personally don't see any reason why he
can't sell it,'' District Attorney Paul Wendler said.
   Williams, who makes $800 a month, has yet to make one of the
$6,500 monthly payments on the four-bedroom house on five acres
with swimming pool, spa, marble floors and a grand view of the
southern San Francisco Bay. The house recently was reappraised at
$1.3 million.
   The mortgage holder, World Savings and Loan Association, is
foreclosing, but if the sale for $1.2 million goes through before
foreclosure Williams could pocket a cool half-million-dollar profit.
   Williams' alleged scam was discovered in April when he reported
the theft of $5,400 worth of electronics equipment from the house.
San Mateo County Sheriff's Department investigators say he came in
the next day reporting that another $90,000 worth of items had also
been stolen, including $80,000 in clothing.
   ``That's when I got suspicious,'' said detective Bill Cody, who
then discovered Williams had phony income tax returns and W-2 forms
identifying him as a consultant with a yearly income of up to
$550,000.

<TEXT>
   About 350 people gathered outside Amelia
Earhart's hometown Saturday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of
the flight that made her the first woman to fly across the Atlantic.
   The 99s, an honorary society of female pilots founded by
Earhart, sponsored the celebration at the International Forest of
Friendship's Memory Lane.
   Earhart's sister, Muriel Earhart Morrissey, 87, of Boston,
attended the ceremonies, as did Russ Brinkley, of Harrisburg, Pa.,
a journalist who wrote the first story on Earhart before her
trans-Atlantic flight June 18, 1928.
   Earhart, who was 29 when she made her famous flight, departed
from Boston with two male co-pilots and landed in Carthmenshire,
South Wales, making the trip in 22 hours.
   She disappeared while attempting to fly around the world with
her navigator, Fred Noonan, on July 2, 1937, in the Pacific. No
trace of the pair or Earhart's plane was found, and she is
officially considered lost at sea.
   The 992 on Saturday also honored 45 people who have contributed
to aviation development, including actor James Stewart, retail
magnate Sam Walton, automaker Henry Ford, Adm. Wesley McDonald and
women aviators Opal McClung, Sophia Payton and Jo Eddleman.

<HEAD>FAA Reportedly Won't Consider Limit On Flights Per Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has refused
to consider reducing the number of flights at O'Hare International
Airport despite repeated requests by federal safety officials who
fear traffic overloads, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The clash of positions was underscored in a May 31 letter from
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board to the
head of the FAA, the Chicago Tribune reported.
   The newspaper said NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett told FAA chief T.
Allan McArtor in the letter that the board considered the FAA's
position on O'Hare's traffic volume ``unacceptable.''
   The letter preceded the safety board's announcement June 8 of an
investigation into a sharp rise in controller error at O'Hare. Air
traffic controllers have made 20 mistakes so far this year,
allowing planes to fly too close to each other, compared with just
12 in all of 1987.
   Investigators, who concluded their on-site work last week, are
looking to see if work overload played any role in the recent
incidents.
   ``I think things are in the embryonic stage as to what the
evaluation is,'' said Michael Benson, a board spokesman in
Washington. ``There is no way to tell where it is going. I haven't
heard of any (single cause) that has jumped out and said, `Fix
me.'''
   The NTSB can only make suggestions; it has no enforcement power.
   In the past, the NTSB has urged FAA officials to re-examine the
limit of 155 flights per hour at O'Hare to see if it is too high,
but the agency has declined to do so, the Tribune reported.
   Burnett questioned the limit last March during a congressional
hearing in Chicago on problems at O'Hare. He said it may be
overloading air traffic controllers.
   ``There is a tendency to take shortcuts, to not follow standard
procedures that slow down operations,'' Burnett said. ``They are
pushing too hard to do what is being asked of them.''
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Sunday editions that
the lagging capacity of the nation's airports could paralyze air
traffic within five years without a national commitment to a
building project on the scale of the program that built the
interstate highway system.

   An earthquake struck the northern Gulf of
California on Saturday, but Red Cross and local authorities said
they had no reports of damage or casualties.
   David Novelo, a spokesman with the National Seismological
Institute said the quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale at its
epicenter in Ometepec Bay at the northern tip of the Gulf of
California, 1,300 miles northwest of Mexico City or about 100 miles
south of Calexico, Calif.
   Novelo earlier reported the quake measured 6.0.
   The temblor occurred at 4:52 p.m. local time (6:52 p.m. EDT).
   Don Finley, a spokesman in Washington for the U.S. Geological
Survey, said the agency's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo.,
measured the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter
scale.
   The quake ``lasted about three or four seconds'' in Ciudad
Obregon in Sonora state, said Froylan Campos, a reporter with the
Tribuna del Yaqui newspaper.
   Alejandra Garcia, a Red Cross official in Ciudad Obregon, said
there were no reports of injuries or damages in the city, located
about 1,170 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   The quake was not felt in the border city of Mexicali, capital
of Baja California state, said Alberto Carrillo, a Red Cross
official in Mexicali.
   ``Absolutely nothing was felt or reported'' in the peninsular
state of Baja California Sur, said Julio Cesar Saucedo, press
officer for the state government in La Paz.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by the motion of the ground. Every
increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale can cause
severe damage.
   The quake that killed at least 9,500 people in Mexico City on
Sept. 19, 1985 measured 8.1 on the Richter scale.

   A newborn pygmy sperm whale that beached
itself near Patrick Air Force Base died Friday at Sea World marine
park in Orlando, park officials said.
   The 2-foot calf, orphaned when its mother died in the surf, had
been cared for by animal handlers at Sea World since late Tuesday.
But they had not expected him to survive since most whales only
seek land when they are in extreme difficulty.
   The animal apparently died from a combination of factors, said
Sea World research biologist Dan Odell. The results of a necropsy
to determine the cause of death are not expected for several weeks,
he said.
   The cause of death of the 10-foot mother whale also has not been
determined.

<TEXT>
   Two men from Northern Ireland were convicted
Friday of plotting an Irish Republican Army bombing campaign in
England.
   Patrick McLaughlin and Liam McCotter are to be sentenced Monday
and could receive terms of up to life in prison.
   They were arrested by agents of the Anti-Terrorist Squad in
February 1987 after nearly 200 pounds of explosives along with
detonators, timing devices, three rifles and ammunition were found.
   The explosives and weapons were hidden in plastic garbage cans
in the Macclesfield and Delamere forests south of Manchester in
northern England.
   Prosecuting attorneys said police also found maps of Manchester
and London in the Manchester apartment the two men shared.
   The court was told that McLaughlin, 40, and McCotter, 25, both
from Belfast, were kept under surveillance for four days as they
transferred the weapons from a trawler off the Welsh coast into the
forests.
   Full details of the operation were not revealed at the trial.
Prosecutor Roy Amlot told the jury that the Anti-Terrorist Squad
had ``the wider public interest to consider'' and could not release
information that might jeopardize future operations.
   ``Intelligence for the Anti-Terrorist Squad and police in this
country generally is critical. It might prevent another bombing
campaign,'' he said.
   Amlot said the contents of the arms caches was sufficient for a
``sustained and prolonged'' terror campaign with at least 25 bombs.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is battling to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland. The IRA
is outlawed in both Britain and Ireland.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, responding to attacks by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., levelled from Tennessee and Florida that Dukakis is a
``Teddy Kennedy liberal'' who is soft on crime: ``They send some
guy from Arizona to Florida who doesn't know beans from brown
bread.''
   
   SEN. SAM NUNN of Georgia, asked if he would accept a spot on the
presidential ticket with Dukakis if invited: ``I think it's very
presumptuous to sort of set up a hypothetical example of what one
would do if one were offered something that one is not seeking and
one is discouraging.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, on allegations of widespread bribery and corruption
at the Pentagon: ``Corruption anywhere in government is bad enough,
but these people, should the allegations prove true, were not just
stealing money from the Treasury, they were stealing from our
national defense and undermining our national security.''

<TEXT>
   A band of British hippies heading for an annual
festival of modern-day Druids invaded the ancient Stonehenge
monument and scuffled with police who tried to keep them away.
   Nine vehicles drove through a perimeter fence Friday night and
then, with police in pursuit, the occupants jumped out and ran
across the open land around the giant stones.
   Police said they made about 30 arrests for alleged criminal
damage and public order offenses.
   ``A number of them did resist arrest and they put up a very
fierce struggle which had to be curtailed,'' said assistant chief
constable James Hogarth.
   The hippies' annual convoy, heading for a traditional ceremony
by white-robed modern-day Druids on the first day of summer next
Tuesday, had been monitored by police as it drove through Wiltshire
county.
   Police said they warned the convoy not to stop at Stonehenge but
some vehicles suddenly turned off the road and smashed a hole in
the fence.
   Stonehenge, 85 miles west of London, is a state-protected
monument of the government-funded English Heritage. The
organization bars hippies from the annual summer ceremony because
they allegedly damaged the turf and the stones in past years.
   On the first day of summer, the sun rises over one of the stones
creating an avenue of shadow within the monument, underpinning a
belief that the prehistoric stone circle, dating from about 1800
B.C., was built for a religious or ceremonial purpose.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese court has sentenced seven officials,
including two local Communist Party leaders, to prison terms for
neglect of duty in a disastrous forest fire last year that claimed
193 lives.
   The seven were given prison terms ranging from two to five years
by a court in northeast China's Heilongjiang province following a
five-day trial. Four others received prison terms of three to seven
years for causing the Heilongjiang fire which raged for more than a
month in May and June last year.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said today that Zhuang Xueyi,
director of a local forestry bureau, received a three-year prison
term for failing to evacuate forest farm workers, resulting in 43
deaths.
   Also getting a three-year term Friday was Li Yongqing, former
deputy secretary of the Mohe County Communist Party Committee, who
ignored orders to clear out the site of a burned area, leading to
further damage when high winds revived the fire.
   Another local party official was imprisoned for three years for
fleeing in a car with his wife and son, leaving behind 1,000 people
at a threatened forest farm.
   The deputy chief of a fire-fighting section received four years
in jail for ordering three fire engines to protect his house when
fire theatened an oil depot and a grain warehouse nearby.
   Two others were found guilty of hiring unqualified workers who
caused fires by operating machinery without supervision.
   The fire ravaged more than 2.5 million acres of Daxinganling
Forest near the Sino-Soviet border. The Forestry Miniser, Yang
Zhong, and his deputy, Dong Zhiyong, were dismissed for mismanaging
the fire-fighting efforts.

<HEAD>Study Says EPA Skimps On Cleanup Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study agency is criticizing
the Environmental Protection Agency for trying to save money by not
choosing permanent cleanup methods often enough at the worst toxic
waste sites.
   ``Technical evidence confirms that all too frequently, Superfund
is not working environmentally the way the law directs it to,''
said the report by the Office of Technology Assessment.
   The report was prepared to coincide with a hearing Monday by the
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. It was released in advance and an embargo requested by
OTA was broken Friday.
   The report examined EPA's compliance with 1986 amendments that
require the agency to prefer permanent remedies designed to reduce
the ``toxicity, mobility or volume'' of the waste, and to analyze
the risk of failure if waste is to be put or left in the ground
untreated.
   Treatment methods might be incineration of soil or turning the
contaminated soil into a glassy solid.
   The amendments were adopted because of congressional concern
that EPA, trying to stretch its funds, too often was applying
``Band-Aid'' solutions or was moving waste from a Superfund site to
a hazardous waste landfill that was likely to become such a site.
   ``Impermanent remedies, which provide less protection than
permanent ones and do not assuredly meet cleanup goals, are often
selected purely because they are cheaper in the short run; in the
long run they are very likely to be more expensive,'' the report
said.
   ``Permanence may be claimed even when technical factors suggest
a high probability of failure,'' it said.
   The authors examined 104 cleanup decisions that fell under the
1986 requirements and selected 10 they said were representative.
   Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator in charge of the
Superfund program which provides money to clean up sites requiring
quick attention, said the study was ``a very superficial look at
the program.''
   ``I wouldn't mind if they didn't try to draw such sweeping
conclusions ...,'' Porter said. ``I disagree with the
extrapolations they make.''
   Porter said treatment technologies were possible in 87 of the
104 cases, and were selected in 67 instances. ``We're not getting
enough credit.''
   The law also requires EPA to chose ``cost-effective'' remedies
and to consider preferences of states and communities involved.
   ``They continually pressure us to be consistent but I keep
telling them the communities aren't consistent, the states aren't
consistent and the problems aren't consistent,'' Porter said.
   States pay 10 percent of federal cleanup costs, ``and states
tell us, `I'm not going to pay 10 percent of $80 million,''' Porter
said. ``Whether people like or don't like a technology (like
incineration) varies from place to place.''

<TEXT>
   Priests who fall in love and marry say they
should not have to give up their priestly duties, especially since
there is such a critical shortage of clergy in the Roman Catholic
Church.
   ``They haven't been able to accept us. ... What I'd like to see
them do is to begin to open the doors,'' said Carl Hemmer, a former
Jesuit from Fairfax, Va.
   Frank Bonnike, a founder of the Corps of Reserve Priests United
for Service, said married priests feel ``that women and marriage
and family and children have enhanced our ability to minister.''
   ``We have two calls: the call to priestly work and the call to
marriage. We can be faithful to both,'' he said Friday as the group
opened its first national conference.
   About 10 percent of U.S. parishes have no full-time priest,
according to the group, which said the figure is more than 40
percent worldwide. Fewer young men are entering seminaries, and
celibacy is cited in surveys as an important reason.
   Terrance A. Sweeney, whose 1986 survey of U.S. bishops showed
that nearly a quarter favored optional celibacy for priests, called
the church's policy against marriage for priests ``contrary to God
and human nature.''
   ``It's a scandal that the church proclaims the dignity of the
human person and human rights to the world, but within her own
walls and her canon laws ... forbids this fundamental human
right,'' he said.
   Since the 12th century, the Catholic church has demanded priests
take a vow of celibacy, maintaining that unmarried clergymen are
better able to devote themselves to God and the priesthood.
   Priests who marry are forbidden to say Mass or have a parish but
are allowed to perform some sacraments in an emergency. The church
terms them ``former priests,'' although once a priest is ordained
he is considered a priest for life.
   The priests' group says there are between 15,000 and 17,000
married priests in the United States. The National Conference of
Catholic Bishops said it had no official figures and declined
further comment Friday.
   Women who marry priests have their own difficulties, said Pamela
Sweeney, who has been married to Terrance Sweeney for seven months.
   ``I really went through a very soul-searching period. I didn't
know whether I should feel ashamed and guilty and dirty to fall in
love with this man,'' she said. ``I have been called every name in
the book _ seductress and temptress and the devil. It's very
painful.''
   She feels women are not to blame for taking men away from the
priesthood but rather, ``it's that the church is preventing them
from functioning.''
   ``Priests do fall in love, and no law that imposes celibacy can
say that those emotions are not going to take place,'' she said.

   Betty, Jughead and Reggie are safe at home
in Riverdale, but Archie and Veronica have lost their foam rubber
heads, which presumably are loose somewhere in San Francisco.
   ``We were horrified. We can't feel very comfortable with
somebody running around with Veronica's head, doing God knows
what,'' David Silberkleit, vice president of marketing or Archie
Comic Publications, creator of the cartoon characters.
   ``There's an inherent liablity in that these heads are wandering
around the streets of San Francisco. A person could do weird things
with these heads,'' he fretted.
   The Mamaroneck, N.Y.,-based company is offering a $500 reward
for information leading to the safe return of the two giant foam
rubber heads of Archie Andrews and Veronica Lodge, worth an
estimated $2,000 each.
   The heads apparently disappeared from the St. Francis-Westin
Hotel in San Francisco about two weeks ago. They were in town for a
performance at an annual newspaper comic strip awards.
   Fortunately, there were two Archie heads and Betty is filling in
for Veronica at scheduled appearances.
   ``For once in Betty's life she has Archie all to herself,''
Silberkleit said.

   A jury has awarded a transsexual $4,500
to pay for new surgery to repair problems caused by a sex-change
operation in 1979.
   A Jackson County Circuit Court jury on Friday awarded the money
to Davina Gabriel, 34, who claimed the doctor who performed the
surgery was negligent. Jurors voted 9-3 in favor of the plaintiff,
who had sought $430,000.
   The suit filed against Dr. Robert Coleman, a plastic surgeon who
performed the two-stage operation.
   It claimed the manufactured vagina inserted during the operation
was too small for intercourse. The suit said the surgeon failed to
warn his patient of that possibility, resulting in depression and
four suicide attempts.
   In closing statements Thursday, James H. Ensz, the defense
lawyer, said the suit was filed against Coleman to get money.
   ``A person wanted to punish a doctor and by obvious inference
wanted to make a lot of money,'' Ensz said. ``But money is not
going to make this person feel any better about herself. What Dr.
Coleman has done is performed a good surgery. Unfortunately, the
plaintiff can't accept it, won't accept it.''
   Cathleen Connealy, a lawyer for the plaintiff, called Coleman
arrogant and insensitive.
   ``He decided her complaints were all in her head. He is
responsible for her severe psychological deterioration ... and the
emotional hell she has lived,'' she said.

<HEAD>US Overtures To Japan Hint At Potential Summit Victory For Reagan</HEAD>

   As leaders of the world's largest industrialized
democracies began assembling today for their annual economic summit
meeting, U.S. overtures to Japan for a free trade agreement hinted
at a potential final triumph for President Reagan.
   Already on the summit agenda was a U.S. joust with the Europeans
over agriculture subsidies. The U.S. delegation, probably joined by
Canada, will seek an end to all agricultural subsidies, but the
idea is meeting stiff resistance from France and West Germany.
   Embarking on negotiations with Japan for a free trade agreement
would overshadow any move on subsidies. More than one-third _ $59.8
billion _ of America's 1987 trade deficit of $170.3 billion
represented the edge Japan has in trade with the United States.
   Critics contend this could be sharply reduced if the two
partners opened their markets to each other without protectionist
devices. Reagan has made the seven economic summits he has attended
since 1981 a test of his free enterprise policy, and he has
invariably triumphed.
   While there is no current discussion over such a treaty, U.S.
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said Friday in Washington
that a free trade agreement ``would be something that the United
States would be pleased to consider if it were something that the
government of Japan wanted to consider.''
   As Baker made the comments in a television interview with
foreign journalists, Secretary of State George P. Shultz made
tentative plans to meet here next week with Japanese Foreign
Minister Sosuke Uno.
   The trade imbalance was bound to be on the agenda for Shultz, an
ardent free-trader who has kept a careful eye on the robust yen.
   The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, the first to arrive,
pledged in a speech Friday at Toronto University that ``we will use
all means at our disposal to promote stable, non-inflationary world
economic growth. We will resolutely combat protectionism of any
kind.''
   As he received an honorary degree, Kohl said the industrialized
countries would have to find ways to avoid overproducing food.
   The summit host, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, visited
the convention center where the summit will open on Sunday to tell
reporters he hoped it would be ``a world-class event.''
   He said Reagan, who will be making his final summit appearance,
had been ``a good friend and valued ally'' and that future summits
would be ``much poorer'' without him.
   With countries around the world spending $150 to $200 billion on
farm subsidies, Mulroney said, ``It is very important that all of
us, including Japan, recognize that these subsidies to agriculture
are trade-distorting in nature (and) eventually protectionist.''
   The Canadian added: ``They cost treasuries more money than any
of us can legitimately afford and ultimately they're very harmful
to the farmers.''
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived late Friday
after a one-day stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, while
Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Ciriaco De Mita of
Italy were scheduled to fly in today.
   Reagan and French President Francois Mitterrand are due on
Sunday, just before the opening bell.

   Six senators are touring the sun-scorched
wheat lands of Montana and the Dakotas this weekend to help them
come up with recommendations for federal assistance to
drought-stricken growers.
   ``I'm hopeful that the trip will give us a better handle on how
severe the devastation is in these specific locations,'' Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said Friday.
   He told a House-Senate task force convened to assess the problem
that he wanted to ``see firsthand how the drought has affected
wheat and forage land.''
   Task force members said there was no time to lose in producing a
blueprint for combating drought-related financial and food-supply
problems.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, also on hand, has been
saying it is too early to start pushing a drought-aid bill but that
lawmakers should be prepared to act once the full extent of the
damage is clear.
   Lawmakers plan to unveil a few initial recommendations next
Wednesday.
   It remains unclear just how much damage the drought will cause.
USDA authorities still say an inch or so of rain once a week for
the rest of the growing season could bring back Midwest corn and
soybeans.
   Peril to wheat in Montana and the Dakotas is greater, and cattle
growers in several states are searching for feed to replace hay
that has withered under the blazing sun.
   Lawmakers from the afflicted wheat states already are calling
the drought the worst since the dust bowl era and warning that much
of their crop will now be lost even if the skies open up.
   Farmers complain that the drought could crimp their income
potential in two ways.
   Forecasts of a smaller harvest have driven up crop prices, which
in turn has decreased the size of income-support payments some
farmers receive.
   That is because the amount of the farmer's payment is the
difference between the market price of the crop and higher ``target
prices'' that are set by Congress and adjusted annually by the
secretary of agriculture.
   As the market price creeps closer and closer to the target
price, the amount of the payment automatically shrinks. At the same
time, the crop itself is wilting under the blazing sun, making it
impossible for the farmer to take advantage of the higher market
price.
   The scenario grows darker for the farmer who has received a
portion of the income-support payment in advance, used the money to
patch a barn roof or buy new machinery and now may be required to
return part to the government.
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., told the task force it would
``come ultimately to a problem of income security for farmers and a
question of how deficiency (income support) payments will be made.''
   ``The drought task force will work to give farmers a degree of
income safety even in the midst of a drought that extends for
several weeks,'' he said. Lugar said about two-thirds of Indiana's
corn and soybeans is rated in poor condition.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, called for bipartisan action in cooperation with the
administration ``to make sure that the federal government responds
to the catastrophe that many American farmers today face.''
   He said the task force goals should be to assess the drought's
impact on trade and food prices and to formulate an aid package for
farmers.
   ``We have to have a battle plan before too long,'' said Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark. He said the panel must not neglect the health
effects ``a long-protracted heat wave has on the rural elderly.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., declared that it was time for the
federal government to join with local governments and the private
sector in providing irrigation assistance to farmers.
   Some use of the federal crop insurance program to aid
drought-stricken farmers was suggested by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
and Thad Cochran, R-Miss.
   The sign-up deadline for the crop insurance program has long
since expired and in many cases the crops already have begun
growing. But the lawmakers said there still might be a way.

   Special road passes and extra gas rations are
being issued while mule trains and tractor caravans stand poised to
quench Beijing's voracious summer appetite for watermelons.
   Beijing area farmers this year will produce 660 million pounds
of watermelon for the capital's 10 million people, up 20 percent
from 1987, the official China Daily quoted Beijing Vice Mayor Huang
Chao as saying.
   Huang said the city will bring in another 110 million pounds
from other provinces to ward off any possibility of last-minute
shortages.
   The report said the peak for Beijing's annual summertime craving
for watermelons will come on July 10, when fruit stands, peddler
carts and food stores will be weighed down with about 44 million
pounds of the fruit.
   To cope with transport problems, 23 streets have been designated
as routes for out-of-town trucks carrying watermelons from July 1
to Nov. 15. Tractors and mule-drawn carts, normally banned from
city streets, will be allowed to haul in their crop between 8 p.m.
and 4 a.m. from June 25 to Aug. 5.
   Watermelons, or ``western melons,'' in Chinese, are grown
throughout northern and western China. Tradition has it that the
sweetest hail from the hot, dry climes of western Gansu province
near the Dunhuang caves.
   Chinese have elevated the act of choosing a melon for ripeness
and taste to an art form and often spend several minutes handling,
shaking and listening to and smelling the melons before they make a
purchase.
   The China Daily, in a 1982 ode to what Chinese call the ``king
of melons,'' said it ``is used traditionally as a preventive tonic
against sunstroke and heat exhaustion ... (and) it is good for
chronic diseases like high blood pressure, pyelitis, hepatitis and
cholecystitis.''
   The Chinese take their watermelon so seriously that last year
two men were sentenced to life imprisonment for leading 100 vendors
in the theft of 55,000 pounds of watermelon from a Beijing train
depot.
   The taste for watermelon has created other social problems. Last
summer Beijing sanitation workers had to dispose of about 50,000
tons of rinds. In Shanghai, China's largest city, about 1,000
people were treated in hospitals during one summer month after
tripping on discarded rinds.

   A District of Columbia woman who was
convicted of kidnapping an ailing 3-week-old baby from a hospital
room last summer was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison.
   Linda Faye Stancil, 34, was sentenced by Prince George's County
Circuit Judge G.R. Hovey Johnson to 30 years in prison, but 15
years of the sentence were suspended.
   A jury last month convicted her of kidnapping, false
imprisonment and child abduction in the disappearance of Jeremiah
Thate, who was taken from the Prince George's County Hospital
Center in June 1987.
   The baby, the child of Theresa and Robert Thate then of
Hyattsville, Md., was discovered two months later in a Washington
apartment when a District of Columbia fireman noticed a baby he
suspected was Jeremiah when he responded to a fire in the woman's
building.
   Stancil took the baby after suffering a miscarriage and,
according to testimony at her trial, was pregnant at the time of
the abduction but did not know it.
   Ms. Stancil said tearfully prior to her sentencing that ``I
didn't want to hurt (anybody). I did it out of love.''
   Ms. Stancil's attorney, E. Allen Shepherd, said her conviction
will be appealed.

   Columnist Carl T. Rowan says race isn't the
issue in the controversy over his shooting of a white teen-age
intruder at his home, but black activists and other members of the
public aren't so sure.
   ``Anybody who is threatening my family becomes my enemy,''
Rowan, who is black, said on a syndicated television show being
aired today. ``I don't care if he is black, white, blue or green.''
   Since the shooting, attention has focused on Rowan's use of a
gun that was not properly registered according to District of
Columbia law, and talk has centered on whether Rowan would be
charged with a gun violation.
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified law enforcement
sources, reported in today's editions that District of Columbia
police on Friday requested an arrest warrant charging Rowan with
unlawful possession of a handgun, but that the U.S. attorney's
office intervened because its investigation was not concluded.
   Because police charges of unlawful entry against two teen-agers
caught at Rowan's home were withdrawn pending further investigation
by the U.S. attorney, some members of the public have presumed the
youths are off the hook. And, that has stirred public reaction.
   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson suggested to
editors of the Post on Thursday that the intruders, because they
are white and from the affluent suburb of Chevy Chase, Md., are
presumed innocent.
   District of Columbia Councilmember Jim Nathanson, who represents
the area in which Rowan lives, said, ``I agree that there is a
racial issue in terms of those kids, but it's also a class thing.''
   Radio station WOL call-in host Ben Dudley said he received 35 or
40 calls Thursday supporting Rowan's action from his predominantly
black, working class audience.
   ``It's getting a lot of attention because a wealthy black man
shot a white teen-ager,'' said Dudley. ``All of those people were
very supportive of Mr. Rowan's right to support his property.''
   ``In much of the black community, the reaction is one of anger
and disgust,'' said Calvin Rolark, a longtime community activist.
``Whoever heard of someone breaking onto someone's property at 2
a.m. and having charges against them dropped immediately?''
   The U.S. attorney's office would not comment Friday on the
status of its investigation. A source in the U.S. attorney's
office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the federal
prosecutor could renew the charges or press lesser or more serious
charges.
   When Rowan was asked about the racial aspects of the shooting
during the ``Inside Washington'' television talk show, he said:
   ``I can understand why there is some anger in the black
community, but I don't want to get into a position of whipping up
racial frenzy over this case. This is a simple matter of a husband
and a head of a household doing what he had to do, regardless of
who's out there.''
   The television program, syndicated by Post-Newsweek Stations
Inc., is scheudled to be broadcast starting today at various times
around the country.
   Rowan, using a gun belonging to his son, a former FBI agent,
shot 18-year-old Ben Smith in the wrist when Smith confronted him
at his door.
   Authorities said Smith had been swimming uninvited in Rowan's
pool and the commotion awakened Rowan. Smith's companion Laura
Bachman, 19, of Bethesda, Md., also was arrested but charges
against her were also dropped. Other teen-agers allegedly in the
group got away.

autobiography, and promises it won't be boring.

Marcos home-in-exile here.
   ``I have lived a full life, richly and totally lived, through
great glory and grandeur and now humility and deprivation,'' said
the wife of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The Marcoses were deposed from their homeland in February 1986,
but have been allowed to live in Hawaii by the U.S. government.
   ``Like the life of the Marcoses, the book will not be dull,''
she said Thursday.
   The book is being written with Jack Cox, president of Jack Cox
Productions in Abilene, Texas. Cox, who said he was introduced to
Mrs. Marcos by a friend, expects the book to be in stores by
January.
   Mrs. Marcos and Cox wouldn't disclose what advance payment, if
any, she will receive.
   Mrs. Marcos also said Thursday that her daughter, Imee Manotoc
Marcos, is two months pregnant. Ms. Marcos, who has two children,
is living somewhere in North Africa, said Mrs. Marcos, who declined
to specify the country.

   Elizabeth, N.J., Chemical Control Corp., $7.4 million.
   Unproven solidification (chemical fixation) technology was
selected to treat in situ (in-place) highly contaminated subsurface
soil, which previous removal actions had left below the water table
and covered up with gravel. No treatability study was used. The
cost of incineration was overestimated. The cleanup will leave
untreated contamination onsite.

   Tulsa County, Okla., Compass Industries, $12 million.
   Capping (containment) of waste was chosen over incineration.
Capping was called a cost-effective, permanent cleanup even though
it does not provide permanent protection comparable to
incineration. No commitment was made to treat contaminated
groundwater.

   Kansas City, Mo., Conservation Chemical Co., $21 million.
   Capping of the site and a hydraulic containment system to pump
and treat some contaminated groundwater were chosen over excavating
and treating contaminated soil and buried wastes, which was
recommended in an EPA study and by the state. Water treatment
cannot remove all the diverse contaminants at the site. The (record
of decision) said that no estimate could be made for the duration
of the cleanup.

   Crystal City, Texas, Crystal City Airport, $1.6 million.
   Excavation of contaminated soils and wastes (which were buried
in a previous removal action) and their disposal in an unlined
landfill with a cap over it were selected over incineration. No
treatability study supported the conclusion that the selected
remedy is permanent on the basis of the adsorption of diverse
contaminants to site soil. Major failure modes for the landfill
were not examined.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Uniontown, Ohio, Industrial Excess Landfill, $2 million.
   Providing alternate water to houses that have or are likely to
have contaminated wells was a satisfactory interim remedial action.
However, actions to address the source of contamination and to stop
and treat contaminated groundwater are long overdue.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Reading, Ohio, Pristine Inc., $22 million.
   In situ (in-place) vitrification (glassification) was developed
originally for radioactive soils, but its use for chemically
contaminated sites is still unproven. In situ vitrification was
selected _ without treatability test results _ chiefly because its
estimated cost was about half that of onsite incineration. But the
estimated cost for incineration is probably high by a factor of
two. Incineration offers more certainty and probably would cost no
more than the chosen remedy. Groundwater will be pumped and treated
by air stripping and carbon adsorption.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Edison Township, N.J., Renora Inc., $1.4 million.
   The selected remedy makes use of offsite landfilling for soils
contaminated with PCBs. Also, biological treatment was selected for

and for contaminated groundwater, but no treatability study
supported its selection.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Tulsa County, Okla., Sand Springs Petrochemical Complex, $45

   EPA originally said that solidification technology was
ineffective for the high organic content wastes and that onsite
incineration was effective. EPA then reversed itself and selected
solidification for most of the cleanup, which the responsible party
had claimed effective based on its treatability study. Incineration
is to be used if solidification technology is not successfully
demonstrated or fails after solidified material is landfilled on
the floodplain site, but criteria for failure are unspecified.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Harrison, Wis., Schmalz Dump Site, $800,000.
   A simple compacted earth cover over the soil contaminated with

treatment was rejected, although this was a textbook example of
appropriate use of the technology. Voluntary well abandonment and
monitoring was chosen over pumping and treating contaminated
groundwater.

<TEXT>
   Tacoma, Wash., Tacoma Tar Pits, $3.4 million.
   No treatability study results supported the selection of

<TEXT>
   Norway has agreed to remove 14,000 tons of
U.S. trash from Guinea which the west African nation charged was
toxic, officials said.
   A Norwegian ship, the 27,000-ton ``Banja,'' will arrive at the
island of Kassa near Conakry on Sunday to begin the 12-day job of
loading the waste, said Tom Erik Klaveness, spokesman of the
Klaveness shipping group on Friday.
   Klaveness said the waste was from slag-ash the incinerators of
Philadelphia. The ash can be used to produce light concrete for
construction material.
   ``The slag-ash was not `dumped' in Guinea. It was a regular
import by a Guinean company named SIAG,'' Klaveness said.
   He said a Norwegian company has applied to import the waste to
Norway. ``We view such an initiative with great interest,''
Klaveness said.
   Guinean authorities arrested Klaveness' representative Sigmund
Stroemme two weeks ago and charged him as an accomplice in the
illegal import of toxic waste.
   Stroemme was assigned to Conakry to run the local firm Ginomar,
which exports bauxite and is owned by both Guinea and the Klaveness
group.
   Stroemme also is Norway's honorary consul general in Conakry,
but he has no diplomatic status or immunity. Norway's ambassador to
the Ivory Coast, Kjell Oestrem, was dispatched to try and get
Stroemme released.
   Bjoern Skogmo, the Foreign Ministry's acting spokesman,
confirmed Klaveness has arranged to take the waste from Guinea.
   ``The ship will arrive Sunday. We now sincerely hope that
Stroemme will be released quickly,'' Skogmo said.

<HEAD>Bush Promises Action In Fraud Case; Dukakis Pledging Drive Against
Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL C. CRAFT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, heading to Illinois to see what the
drought is doing to farmers and to address state Republicans, is
vowing anyone convicted in the Pentagon fraud case will feel ``the
full force of the law'' if Bush wins the White House. Democratic
presidential nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis, touching prime Southern
bases, promises a no-surrender fight against drugs.
   ``I will not tolerate lawlessness _ in the Pentagon, in the
streets or in the Congress,'' Bush said in Washington Friday about
allegations of corruption in Pentagon procurement programs.
   ``The public should know that a Bush administration will see to
it that any and all charges are aggressively prosecuted and that
the full force of the law is applied to anyone convicted,'' Bush
added.
   The defense probe concerns the alleged sale of confidential
Pentagon information to military contractors through their paid
consultants.
   Bush, the all-but-certain GOP presidential nominee, planned to
stop by a drought-hit farm today and speak at the Republican state
convention in Springfield, Ill. Bush won the Illinois primary March
15.
   Meanwhile, Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor who has been on a
campaign march through the South, arranged to attend the funeral of
Hispanic leader Willie Velasquez today in San Antonio, Texas, and
then to address the Democratic state convention in Houston.
   Dukakis, the Texas primary winner March 8, had been scheduled to
be introduced at the convention by Velasquez, who died Wednesday.
Velasquez is credited with registering thousands of Hispanic voters.
   Jesse Jackson planned to speak today to the Illinois Democratic
Convention in Springfield and then go to an extended black family
reunion in Philadelphia.
   Dukakis went to Mississippi on Friday to propose setting up a
National Alliance Against Drugs, to be headed by the president,
aimed at producing ``drug-free schools in every community in
America in the 1990s.''
   ``Nobody is going to tell me we have to run up the white flag of
surrender on this issue,'' he told the Mississippi Municipal
Association convention in Biloxi.
   ``There's a sense that things are out of control'' in the effort
to deal with the nation's drug situation, he said, and ``our
citizens can't walk down the street and buy a bottle of milk
without being in fear of their lives.''
   In other political developments Friday:
   _Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said he has informed the Dukakis campaign
that he is not interested in becoming the Democratic vice
presidential nominee. However, Nunn stopped short of saying he
would refuse to accept the nomination if offered to him by Dukakis.
   ``I think it's very presumptuous to sort of set up a
hypothetical example of what one would do if one were offered
something that one is not seeking and one is discouraging,'' Nunn
said. ``So I haven't gone to the extent of making a Sherman-like
statement. I feel it's kind of presumptuous and at this stage
unnecessary.''
   _Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter, said in Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho, that Bush should at least consider a woman as a
running mate.
   Despite her statement, she said, she would not press the issue
with Bush. ``I didn't impose my opinion on Ronald Reagan in 1980,
so I don't think I ought to impose my opinion on George Bush in
1988,'' she said.
   _Dukakis was endorsed by Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, who said
that ``in a decade that has sanctified selfishness ... Mike Dukakis
has reminded us of our interdependence and our responsibility to
each other.''
   _Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson urged conservative
Minnesota Republicans who had backed his unsuccessful presidential
candidacy to support Bush in November.
   Robertson said: ``It matters whether the man in the White House
is a mediocre liberal who returns us to the policies of Jimmy
Carter, or a distinguished conservative who builds upon the
foundation of a great Republican, Ronald Reagan.''

   A delegation of lawmakers will go to Iran this
weekend at that country's invitation to explore ways of freeing
British hostages held in Lebanon.
   However, an official of the Church of England, which organized
the trip, said Friday that the four legislators would not conduct
formal negotiations for the release of the men, apparently held by
pro-Iranian kidnappers.
   During the four-day visit to the Iranian capital of Tehran,
beginning Sunday, the legislators will meet high-ranking Iranian
officials.
   The four lawmakers in the mission are Cyril Townsend and Robert
Hicks of the governing Conservative Party, Thomas Clarke of the
Labor Party and Lord Tordoff of the Social Liberal Democrats.
   Clarke said the invitation had come from Parliament speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran were reduced to
caretaker status a year ago but showed signs of improving when the
countries agreed during talks in London last week to compensate
each other for damages to their diplomatic offices.
   The Iranian Embassy building at London's Princes Gate caught
fire when British commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage
siege. British diplomatic buildings and the British Embassy in Iran
were damaged by mobs in 1978, 1979, and 1980.
   
   The British Foreign Office said the lawmakers' trip was
privately organized. ``We have been informed but not consulted,''
said an official there who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The group is not going to negotiate for the return of
hostages,'' said Eve Keatley, a spokeswoman for Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, the spiritual leader of the Church of
England, also known as the Anglican Church.
   ``It is a fact-finding mission to find ways to improve relations
with Iran which could lead to the freeing of Terry Waite and the
other British hostages,'' she said.
   Waite, 49, Runcie's personal envoy, disappeared in Beirut 17
months ago while on his fifth mission to try to win the release of
Westerners abducted in Lebanon.
   Most of the 18 missing foreigners are believed to be held
captive by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed
militant Shiite Moslem faction.
   Nine of the missing are Americans, including the longest-held
hostage, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Other Britons who were kidnapped are John McCarthy, 31, a
television journalist abducted April 17, 1986, as he drove to
Beirut Airport to fly home; and Alec Collett, 64, a New York-based
journalist who disappeared March 25, 1985, while on assignment for
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.
   An Islamic extremist organization claimed Collett had been
killed, but his body has not been found and there has been no proof
that he is dead.
   Brian Keenan, 36, born in the British province of Northern
Ireland but holding a Republic of Ireland passport, was abducted
April 11, 1986. He was walking at the time to the American
University of Beirut, where he worked as an English teacher.
   The mother and sisters of Keenan appealed Friday to the
kidnappers to declare their demands for his release. The appeal,
published in the An-Nahar newspaper said, ``We are poor people, but
are willing to do everything we can to help Brian.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has stressed her determination
not to pay ransom to the captors of Britons. Waite, who had helped
free three American hostages in Lebanon, left instructions
forbidding any ransom payment if he was kidnapped.
   Mrs. Keatley said the Anglican church has ``repeatedly made it
clear we are not prepared to be party to any deal which would
indicate in any way that hostage-taking pays dividends.''

<TEXT>
   The White House AIDS commission's final
report, made up of two crucial sections stitched together at the
end of a marathon session, calls on President Reagan to designate a
single government official to head the national fight against the
epidemic.
   The-13 member panel spent two days going over the nearly 600
specific recommendations in the 269-page report word-by-word, but
wound up making no major changes from two draft versions issued
earlier this month.
   However, the decision to stick with a call for federal
legislation to prohibit discrimination against people infected with
the deadly virus barely survived a final, formal vote.
   Although all commissioners expressed support for the sentiment
during informal discussions last week, when the final vote was
taken, only seven of the 12 present backed the proposal being
pushed strongly by retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, the panel
chairman.
   He told reporters later it ``would have made it very difficult
for us to feel we had done a good job'' if that provision had been
lost.
   Watkins has said repeatedly that strong anti-discrimination
legislation lies at the heart of many other things that need to be
done to combat the epidemic, such as more widespread testing.
   ``Comprehensive federal anti-discrimination legislation which
prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the
public and private sectors, including employment, housing, public
accommodations, and participation in government programs, should be
enacted,'' says the recommendation that survived the narrow vote.
``All persons with symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV infection should
be clearly included as persons with disabilities who are covered by
their anti-discrimination protections of this legislation.''
   It was several hours after the key anti-discrimination vote _
shortly before midnight _ before the panel finally agreed on its
recommendations for administrative changes and the wording of an
executive summary that highlights what the commission viewed as its
major recommendations.
   Neither had been available previously in draft form.
   The summary notes that ``we are a long way from all the
answers'' despite what it called an unprecedented research effort
to find a cure or vaccine for the disease.
   ``The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic will be a
challenging factor in American life for years to come and should be
a concern to all Americans,'' said the opening line of the final
report. ``Recent estimates suggest that almost 500,000 Americans
will have died or progressed to later stages of the disease by
1992.''
   The final chapter _ ``Guidance For the Future'' _ was a
compromise blending several more specific options into general
recommendations. Although Watkins had considerable success in
seeing most of his recommendations adopted, the commission
specifically rejected his original suggestion to invest sweeping
new powers in the surgeon general's office.
   The version to be delivered to the White House next Friday will
simply say: ``Commissioners believe that some special management
oversight entity is needed at this early juncture in the epidemic
to see that an action plan to carry out the strategy is
aggressively followed.''
   The report said the president should quickly ``appoint a
continuing external oversight committee ... to provide an ongoing
evaluation of the nation's response to the epidemic.''
   And it said he should ``clearly establish the chain of command
from the Cabinet to all affected units of the federal government,
with a single designated official to manage implementation of this
report and related activities within the existing structure.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. No one is
known to have recovered from AIDS, which most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected people. Its chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users.
   As of June 13, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,896 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 36,480 have died since June 1981, according
to the federal Centers for Disease Control.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels have issued a call for a
90-day cease-fire and direct talks with the government to end more
than 25 years of civil warfare.
   There was no indication on Friday that the civilian government
of President Vinicio Cerezo will accept the rebels' latest call to
renew peace talks. The first round ever held in 27 years of war
took place last October in Madrid, Spain, without visible results.
   The influential military, which held direct control of the
government until permitting Cerezo's inauguration in January 1986,
opposes more talks.
   A scheduled meeting between the rebels and a national
reconciliation commission was canceled after a failed military coup
in May.
   The text of the letter from the commanders of the rebel
coalition Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union to the head of
the reconciliation commission was published in the daily newspapers
El Grafico and Prensa Libre Friday.
   The letter accuses the government of defying a regional peace
plan signed by Cerezo and the presidents of four other Central
American nations last year. The accord calls for negotiations to
end the region's civil wars, of which Guatemala's is the longest.
   The rebel union's statement says the army has secretly
intensified the war in a bid for all-out victory.
   The rebel commanders propose direct, high-level talks with the
government during a cease-fire that would begin on July 1. The
talks would focus on human rights guarantees and on a schedule for
``dismantling the instruments of control of the population that now
exist.''
   Human rights groups accuse the military of committing massive
violations in a bloody anti-guerrilla campaign that began in the
late 1970s. The violence has diminished, but selective killings and
disappearances are still reported.
   In the letter, the guerrillas also set out their conditions for
a political solution to Guatemala's conflict. They said the
government must recognize the historical causes of the conflict,
demonstrate a desire to end the war and recognize the rebel union
as a party to any negotiated settlement.

   Hollywood animator Chuck Jones, the creator
of the popular cartoon character Wile E. Coyote, says current
Saturday morning cartoon fare is ``TV mush that attempts to pass
for animation.''
   ``It's illustrated radio,'' said Jones, 75. ``You can turn off
the picture and know what's going on because they have to describe
it to you.
   ``Good acting will survive on its own. That's the essence of
good cartoons. You can turn off the sound and watch the pictures,''
Jones said Friday.
   ``The quality of the new stuff is flat. Some of these old
cartoons are 50 years old and still being shown. That's good
quality,'' said Jones, in Lincoln for the Animation Festival at the
Sheldon Film Theater.
   Jones also created Pepe le Pew and collaborated in the creation
of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig during his years at Warner
Brothers Studio. He won three Oscars and hundreds of other awards
and honors for some 300 movies.

   Country-western singer Mickey Gilley is
temporarily leaving the stage for a courtroom, where he is suing
his former business partner and accountant for allegedly defrauding
him of $8.2 million.
   As a result of the trial, expected to last three weeks, Gilley
says he's likely to miss five or six performances.
   Gilley is suing Sherwood Cryer and accountant Gerard Willrich
for allegedly cheating him over the past 17 years.
   According to the suit, Cryer was Gilley's manager from 1971 to
1984 but still represents himself as such. The singer also accuses
Cryer of failing to pay him half the profits from the Houston-area
club named after Gilley and for merchandise that carries the
Gilley's name.
   Cryer responded that the claims were filed too late to collect
damages, that no written contracts existed for many of the
transactions and that Gilley silently consented to Cryer's actions.
   ``I'm an entertainer,'' Gilley said Thursday outside the
courtroom. ``I'm not real good at standing and testifying.''

   After a three-year marriage, Bruce
Springsteen and his wife, actress Julianne Phillips, have split,
Miss Phillips' publicist says.
   ``Yes. I'd rather not comment on it. You can say it's been
confirmed,'' Molly Madden, Miss Phillips' spokeswoman, said Friday.
She said neither Springsteen nor Miss Phillips has filed for
divorce.
   Springsteen, 38, the working-class kid who rose from the bar
bands of Asbury Park, N.J., to become one of the world's most
popular rock stars, is in Europe with his ``Tunnel of Love''
concert tour.
   Miss Phillips, 28, is filming ``Fletch II'' with comedian Chevy
Chase, Ms. Madden said.
   The couple met backstage in Los Angeles during his ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' concert tour in 1984. They were married in a private,
midnight ceremony in a church near her family's home in Lake
Oswego, Ore., on May 13, 1985.

   U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy greeted each
new graduate of the nation's oldest school for the hearing and
visually disabled after urging increased federal funding for
programs for the blind and deaf.
   ``Thanks for remembering us,'' said Mark Belair, a new graduate

   Kennedy, D-Mass., lauded the 19 graduates Friday.
   ``Our nation has prospered by recognizing the contributions that
physically and mentally challenged individuals can make,'' said
Kennedy, whose 26-year-old son, Edward Kennedy Jr., lost a leg in
1973 due to bone cancer.
   ``We have much to learn from those once thought incapable of
independent living or achievement. Their examples inspire us all to
try harder to eliminate the barriers,'' he said.

   The songwriters who penned ``Jailhouse
Rock'' and ``Hound Dog'' are suing a restaurant for playing the
tunes without permission.
   Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, whose songs produced hits for
Elvis Presley, alleged in a federal lawsuit Thursday that owners of
Big Top Pizza Palace have caused them irreparable harm by piping
the songs over the restaurant's loudspeakers without authorization.
   A co-plaintiff is Sheb Wooley, who wrote the song ``The Purple
People Eater.''
   The lawsuit, which seeks damages of up to $10,000 for each of
the plaintiffs, alleges the restaurant owners ignored repeated
letters and visits from representatives of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, which licenses the songs.
   Owners of the restaurant could not be reached for comment Friday.
   Attorney Nancy Mays, who represents the songwriters, said it is
a standard procedure for restaurants or nightclubs to arrange for
licensing through ASCAP or Broadcast Music Inc., which represent
composers.

   The legal eagle for rock 'n' roller Jerry
Lee Lewis knows the show must go on.
   The rock pioneer was about to give a rooftop concert at the
historic Peabody Hotel on Friday for the Tennessee Bar Association
when a member of the audience decided to conduct a little
unfinished business.
   Attorney Frank Clayton of Nashville tried to seize Lewis' $5,000
payment for the performance. Clayton represents Oklahoma nightclub
owner George Cunningham, who won a suit against Lewis in 1978 for
$483,645 after the flamboyant entertainer failed to appear for a
concert at The Whiskey River Club. Lewis never repaid the advance
fee he received.
   When Clayton learned that Lewis' band was to receive the fee
instead of the entertainer, he tried to serve Lewis with a court
order allowing him to collect the $483,645 award.
   But Lewis' attorney, Jim Sanderson, accepted the suit himself,
preventing Lewis from getting the writ before the show and possibly
ruining Lewis' mood for the performance.

   The chance to swim with a pod of
dolphins and even hop a ride on a passing dorsal fin has tourists
lining up at attractions in the Florida Keys, but some
environmental activists worry the animals will be exploited.
   Three attractions and a resort in the Keys charge as much as $50
each to tourists who have been on waiting lists for more than a
month to take their 15-minute ``dolphin encounter.''
   ``Where else are you able to get up close and feel the dolphin's
skin and experience its gentleness and the way it uses its
echo-location systems?'' said Mike Wood, curator of Theater of the
Seas ocean park in Islamorada. ``People leave here with a whole new
appreciation for these animals. It's a tremendous educational
experience.''
   Stormy and Genie, the attraction's two 7-foot-long Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins, have splashed along with 12 swimmers every day
for the past year. They appear to relish the human contact _
nuzzling kisses on the cheeks of young women, wagging their
powerful tails to stand in the water and ``dance,'' and even flying
out of the water to turn somersaults above swimmers' heads.
   The dolphins chirp and click after each task until the trainer
has rewarded them with fish. The wide-eyed tourists come away with
spectacular photographs and a few minutes they'll never forget.
   ``This is something I've wanted to do my whole life and now I
can say I've done it,'' Alan Larosee of North Providence, R.I.,
said as he climbed out of the oceanside, landlocked lagoon.
   But the environmental group Greenpeace is not as enthusiastic.
   It views any public display of dolphins for profit as
exploitative and is calling for government regulation of swim
programs.
   ``The dolphin swims in the Keys have been very popular and
that's been encouraging several big resorts around the country to
think about capturing dolphins for a program of their own,'' said
Lesley Scheele of the Fort Lauderdale chapter of Greenpeace.
   ``Our concern is that this could escalate to the point where
everybody trying to lure a tourist is applying to capture dolphins
for a swim program,'' she said. ``This could end up putting a major
strain on wild populations.''
   Dolphins have been a protected species since 1972 under the
Marine Mammal Protection Act, which allows for the tightly
controlled capture of dolphins for public display.
   But the law doesn't specifically address ``dolphin encounters''
or how they should be operated.
   ``I've seen some places where they dump 10 people in the water
and they're all grabbing at one dolphin _ all the animal wants to
do is get away,'' said Chip Hershaw, a trainer at the non-profit
Dolphin Research Center on Grassy Key, which has operated a swim
program for three years.
   ``There's a right way and and wrong way to go about it,'' he
said.
   Theater of the Seas, Dolphin Research Center and Dolphins Plus
in Key Largo are the only places that have been granted federal
display permits along with special experimental permits to run the
swim programs, while Hawk's Cay Resort operates dolphin swims with
only a display permit, said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the
National Marine Fisheries Service in Washington, D.C.
   The regulatory agency has conducted public hearings on the issue
here and in Washington and has appointed an expert panel to come up
with a set of dolphin encounter guidelines, Gorman said.
   Until those rules are issued, expected by mid-summer, the
fisheries service has ordered a moratorium on any more dolphin swim
programs. That has delayed plans by a Hyatt Hotel in Hawaii to
capture six dolphins for swims with guests, Gorman said.
   ``Ideally, we'd like to see the dolphin swims restricted to only
non-profit research facilities, places where there's a real
educational mission,'' said Ms. Scheele of Greenpeace. ``Anytime
profit is the main motive there's a possibility of abuse.''
   The group has also recommended that any swim facility be set up
to allow dolphins to come and go from the wild freely and not be
forced to interact with humans, said Bo Bricklemyer, a Greenpeace
attorney in Washington.
   There may also be health risks when humans swim with dolphins,
Ms. Scheele said, since it is not known exactly what is causing a
virus that has killed hundreds of dolphins in the last year along
the East Coast. She said there has been no proof that dolphins and
humans have exchanged such viruses.
   Wood of Theater of the Seas agrees there should be some
regulation, but he feels many checks are already in place to
protect dolphins and said for-profit attractions can help in that
effort.
   ``The whole idea that we're out to rape the oceans of all the
dolphins is incredibly misleading,'' he said. ``The federal
government nowadays makes it a long, arduous and expensive process
just to get the approval to capture a dolphin _ there's no way the
law would allow a big run on dolphins.''
   Federal law allows fewer than 100 dolphins to be taken for
scientific or public display purposes every year, yet as many as
12,500 dolphins are allowed to be ``incidentally'' killed in nets
in the commercial harvests of tuna and other fish, Gorman said.
   ``The number of dolphins that could ever be taken for swim
programs is a drop in the bucket,'' Wood said. ``Greenpeace has
their priorities way out of line here. It's programs like ours that
create the awareness to save the dolphins that are really
endangered.
   ``We're not getting rich off the dolphin swim program either,''
he said. ``If we wanted to get rich we could run this like a ride
at Disney World. We would never allow that to happen.''

   Two hundred years ago Tuesday, the federal
Constitution became the supreme law of the United States when,
after months of bickering, New Hampshire cast the ninth and
deciding vote to ratify.
   The decision ``laid the top stone to the grand FEDERAL EDIFICE,
and happily raised the NINTH pillar,'' rejoiced the New Hampshire
Gazette, based in the Federalist stronghold of Portsmouth. The 13
states had decided at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia
that nine votes were needed to ratify.
   At a party the following week, nine candles were lit in each
window of the Portsmouth Statehouse and a band played.
   ``Language is too poor to describe the universal joy that glowed
in every countenance,'' the Gazette reported.
   But, if the wealthy traders and military elite of the seacoast
celebrated the establishment of a stronger national government, the
less-educated anti-Federalists in the central parts of the state
grudgingly accepted their defeat in the 57-47 ratification vote.
   ``It is adopted,'' said Joshua Atherton of Exeter, key spokesman
of the anti-Federalists, who initially commanded a majority. ``Let
us try it.''
   The vote capped a bitter debate between Federalists, who argued
that a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull
the country out of a recession, and their opponents, who believed
the Constitution laid the groundwork for the kind of tyrannical
central government they fought in the Revolution.
   In February 1788, New Hampshire had held a constitutional
convention in which Atherton had the votes needed to reject the
document. Had Federalists not scrambled to adjourn the Exeter
meeting, New Hampshire might have earned the distinction of being
the first state to reject the Constitution.
   ``With Rhode Island's rejection following, two in a row, it just
could have blunted the whole process,'' said Dartmouth historian
Jere Daniell.
   Atherton, a Harvard-educated lawyer who had been a British
loyalist in the early years of the war, argued that the
Constitution threatened the state power and personal liberties. He
also argued fervently against a federal judiciary.
   When he rose to speak, he whipped a cape around him, struck
dramatic postures and ``naturally made himself obnoxious to
supporters of the Constitution,'' wrote Charles Bell in ``The Bench
and Bar of New Hampshire.''
   John Quincy Adams, who came up from Massachusetts for the
debates, found Atherton ``a miserable speaker and a worse
reasoner.''
   Others found Atherton more compelling, including abolitionists
who later credited him with strong opposition to the section of the
Constitution that allowed slavery.
   Religion was another potent issue. Some in New Hampshire thought
federal law should mirror their state's requirement _ until 1877 _
that officeholders provide proof of Protestant affiliation.
   The proposed two- and six-year federal legislative terms also
frightened anti-Federalists who saw the state's one-year terms as
more reasonable.
   Thirty-eight delegates arrived at the convention with binding
orders from their towns to reject the Constitution.
   But such Federalists as John Langdon, an international trader
who represented the state at the Constitutional Convention; John
Sullivan, a former general and president of New Hampshire, and
Samuel Livermore, a Superior Court chief justice, had strong
personal and political skills.
   Newspapers were inundated with Federalist articles, emphasizing
the inefficiency of interstate trade, devastating unemployment and
the inability to defend frontier areas under the Articles of
Confederation.
   Several capitalized on Atherton's Tory past, accusing him of
``wishing to prevent the adoption of a system only because it will
put it out of the power of Britain to subjugate us.''
   Federalist politicking was aided by the momentum of eight states
_ Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland and South Carolina _ standing behind the
document.
   ``Eight States have already adopted it, and should we but make
the ninth, would it not be much to our credit?'' asked a letter in
the Gazette.
   The race to cast the decisive vote was with Virginia, which also
was meeting in June, in Richmond.
   When delegates gathered in Concord's Old North Meeting House on
June 18, 1788, Federalist leaders knew they had the numbers to win.
They wanted a speedy vote, but Atherton stalled, arguing that only
with a 12-item addendum of rights should the Constitution pass.
   To ratify it without requiring a bill of rights, he said, was
``to surrender our all, and then ask our new Masters if they will
be so gracious as to return to us some, or any part of, our most
important rights and privileges.''
   The ploy failed, and the convention moved for a vote on
accepting the Constitution unconditionally _ though with a
recommendation of future passage of the Bill of Rights.
   The final vote on June 21 approved the Constitution by a margin
of 10, surprising even the most optimistic pro-Constitution
strategists.
   Convention Secretary John Calfe recorded the time, 1 p.m., in
case Virginia disputed it, and a letter was dispatched to Richmond.
   Five days later, before the letter arrived, Virginia became the

   The commuter train zips along at
50 miles an hour. On top of a car a young man stands up and waves
his arms like a bird in flight.
   The slightest slip could mean a fatal fall; the slightest jolt
could mean contact with a 3,000-volt electrical wire overhead.
   Nevertheless, Paulo Evaristo, 15, and hundreds of other youths
from Rio de Janeiro's poor outlying suburbs risk their lives every
day showing off their skills in what is known as train surfing.
   Some 150 train surfers were killed last year, 40 in the first
five months of this year.
   The government company that runs the commuter trains has had to
pay the equivalent of $700,000 in claims filed by the survivors of
youths killed or by youths who have been injured. More than 400
young men were injured in 1987, some permanently paralyzed.
   ``These people are seeking new thrills, but in my opinion
they're suicidal,'' said Helio Barros, spokesman for the railroad.
He added that efforts to discourage the train surfers have failed.
   ``With the money we spent on claims, we could have repaired 10
trains,'' he said. He added that the railroad is trying to persuade
judges not to validate claims in cases of train-surfing accidents.
   ``I've been doing this since I was 13,'' said Paulo Evaristo.
``You get a feeling of freedom that is greater than any fear.''
   Paulo Evaristo is a grade-school dropout and works as a
messenger. He declined to give his last name in an interview.
   Train surfers come from poor neighborhoods, and some Brazilian
newspapers have speculated the young people are trying to emulate
the sea surfers at wealthy beachfront districts, such as Copacabana
and Ipanema. The newspaper accounts also have suggested the surfers
ride train roofs because they can't afford the 15-cruzado (8-cent)
fare, or that there's no room in the crowded trains, which
transport 1.2 million passengers daily.
   But Barros, the railroad spokesman, dismissed all these
arguments.
   ``It's strictly for the fun,'' he said. ``In the first place,
you have to pay the fare to get inside the train stations. And even
when it's not rush hour and there are plenty of seats, you still
see these kids on top of the cars.''
   The train company has assigned 200 guards a day to try to stop
train surfers. But the guards are not enough to cover the commuter
system's 450 miles of track and 110 stations.
   When they do arrest a train surfer, the penalty is a fine
equivalent to $1 and a lecture from a government psychologist.
   ``The purpose is not to jail these people,'' Barros said. ``It
is to save their lives.''
   Chief Fernando Rodrigues de Almeida of the police precinct of
the Engenho Novo neighborhood ordered 11 train surfers jailed
without bail on charges of obstructing railroad traffic.
   But a judge ruled that train surfing was not a crime, but rather
an act of ``self-injury,'' similar to attempted suicide, and not
dealt with in the Brazilian legal code.
   The judge reprimanded the chief for abuse of authority.
   ``We're not crazy, and we're not bums either,'' said train
surfer Luiz Claudio, 18, an apprentice lathe operator who makes $70
a month, slightly more than the minimum wage. ``We're just looking
for a little fun, to pass the time during the train ride.''
   Elizabeth, 19, a maid, who like Luiz Claudio would not tell her
last name, said she sometimes rides on top of the commuter trains
because the atmosphere inside the cars is ``violent,'' with
frequent muggings. But she added, ``It's a lot of fun, too.''
   Barros, the railroad spokesman, said train surfers have always
been a problem, but the practice reached an all-time high last year.
   He added that the suburb of Nilopolis has a ``Train Surfers
Association'' with three tests for membership: 1) Ride hanging from
the outside of a window or door. 2) Climb up a car in motion and
lie on the roof. 3) Stand on the roof of a moving car.
   The founder of the association, known as Rambo, was killed when
he fell from a train.
   Another member of the group who was killed had a membership card
in his pocket.
   It said, ``Evanil dos Santos passed his test and is authorized
to hang from trains.''

<HEAD>Spinal Cord Research: Tackling a Cure for Paralysis</HEAD>

   EDITORS' NOTE _ Marc Buoniconti, paralyzed while making a tackle
in a 1985 football game, is suing his alma mater, The Citadel, for
negligence in letting him play with a sore neck. As his trial
enters its second week in Charleston, S.C., researchers seek a cure
that would free Buoniconti and hundreds of thousands of others from
their wheelchairs.

   For 20 years, Barth Green struggled
with his frustration, doctoring crushed and twisted spinal cords
while knowing paralysis was permanent and irreversible.
   Spinal cord injuries doomed active, healthy people to spend the
rest of their lives in wheelchairs. In the worst cases, they can't
out of bed, pull on socks or underwear, brush their teeth, comb
their hair, lift a forkful of food to their mouths or scratch an
itch.
   But Green made a lousy fatalist.
   In 1985, he founded the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis,
dedicated to reversing one of the most catastrophic conditions in
medicine by solving the mystery of one of the most complex
structures in biology. Today it is the country's largest and most
comprehensive spinal cord research unit.
   ``No one's ever had the guts to say we want to cure paralysis,
(but) I'm committed to eliminating wheelchairs. It's a world war
against paralysis,'' said Green, a neurosurgeon.
   ``Our philosophy is to approach it like the Manhattan Project to
split atoms to stop Hitler, or the Apollo Project to put a man on
the moon in the space race.''
   In an era when miracle drugs, transplant surgery, laser beams
and artificial body parts have made medicine seem capable of
solving almost anything, paralysis remains stubbornly unconquered.
   Researchers have made progress toward regenerating nerves in
animals' spinal cords with transplants of cells from fetuses,
electrical pulses and genetic engineering.
   But some say the challenge may be tougher than building atomic
bombs or space ships.
   ``Those were engineering problems with a general consensus it
could be done. Those guys had blueprints. We don't have any
blueprints,'' said Dr. Walter Levy, a researcher at the Miami
Project.
   ``We're in the Wright brothers stage. What's required is a space
shuttle,'' said Dr. Michael Kliot, a neurosurgeon at Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. ``There's a ray of hope.
But we're very, very far away from curing spinal cord injuries.''
   An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 people in the United States are
paralyzed as a result of injuries, according to the Department of
Health and Human Services; an additional 10,000 to 15,000 people
are hurt each year. No agency keeps precise count.
   Auto accidents account for about half the paralysis cases. Other
causes are dives, falls, and accidents with guns and knives or
while playing sports.
   The average age of victims is 19.
   Marc Buoniconti, son of former All-Pro football linebacker Nick
Buoniconti of the Miami Dolphins, was 19 when his neck broke and
crushed his spinal cord as he made a head-first tackle, paralyzing
him from the neck down Oct. 26, 1985.
   ``I knew I broke my neck right away,'' said Buoniconti, who had
played football since he was a 75-pound 7-year-old. ``My right arm
flopped to the turf. I couldn't move. I couldn't get my breath
back. I couldn't talk.
   ``In one second, I went from the best shape of my life to the
worst,'' Buoniconti said. ``I was taking my last steps doing my
favorite thing. It was on a football field, the place I love the
most.''
   Now, from his wheelchair at home in this Miami suburb, the
21-year-old Buoniconti is tackling paralysis as national spokesman
for the Miami Project. The project's logo is a four-frame sequence
of a stick figure standing up out of a wheelchair, matching the
can-do grit of Buoniconti's personalized license plate that reads
``I'LL WALK.''
   ``It's not a question of `if.' That's not in our vocabulary.
It's a question of when,'' said Steve Towle, the project's
executive director and a former Dolphins linebacker. ``I've seen
what it takes to win. It can be done. It will be done.''
   The spinal cord, encased in the bony armor of the spinal column,
is as wide as a thumb and has the consistency of jellied candy.

<HEAD>Group to Open Runaway Shelter in Small City With Big Problem</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David was sleeping on the streets and
working as a prostitute; the 16-year-old's parents had left him
behind when they moved from Alaska.
   Geanne, also 16, got pregnant and ran away from her Athabascan
Indian village. In Anchorage, she turned to prostitution and was
often beaten by her pimp. She died of a drug overdose.
   There are others, enough to give this city of 230,000 residents
one of the nation's highest per-capita rates of runaway and
homeless youths. At least 1,200 teen-agers are reported as runaways
each year in Anchorage, more than three times the number for
comparable cities, a 1986 municipal study found.
   ``We are not a large city, yet we have a very large problem,''
said Marj Hall, director of the Alaska Juvenile Crime Commission,
where David's and Geanne's cases are on file. Confidentiality
restrictions prevented use of their last names.
   The statistics, and the troubled young faces behind them,
grabbed the attention of Covenant House, a nonprofit group that
until now focused on running shelters in larger cities such as New
York and Houston.
   This summer in Anchorage, Covenant House is turning a beat-up
old YMCA building into a 40-bed shelter where runaways can sort out
their lives and perhaps avoid the dead-end world of life on the
street.
   Covenant House's arrival is lauded by local social workers
frustrated by a lack of long-term care for runaways. But some warn
the shelter, expected to open in October, is no panacea.
   They say Anchorage's runaways are part of a greater malaise
arising from Alaska's frontier demographics _ a young, transient
population isolated from stabilizing family and community ties in
the lower 48 states.
   ``Kids don't have the extended family network here,'' Hall said.
``If they get into trouble, they can't go to Uncle Charlie who
they've known since they were a pup.''
   A boom-bust economy contributes to social instability, as does
the cultural upheaval besetting Alaska's 14-percent native
population.
   The result: Alaska consistently places at or near the top of the
charts in per-capita rates of drug and alcohol abuse, rape, child
abuse, divorce, suicide, assault and domestic violence.
   Trouble at home gives some Alaska youths good reason to run. But
once on the street, they face bigger trouble as easy targets for
drug-pushers, pimps and sexual exploiters.
   In the early 1980s, when North Slope oil revenues swelled state
budgets, officials increased funding for social programs, but
social workers say little went toward helping runaway kids. Today,
Anchorage has only 10 beds available for runaways, and now that the
oil boom has busted, government money is hard to come by.
   Enter Covenant House, the group started 19 years ago in New York
City when the Rev. Bruce Ritter, a Franciscan priest, started
letting street kids sleep on his apartment floor. Today, Covenant
House runs shelters in six cities and provides food, clothing,
medical care and counseling to more than 20,000 youths a year.
   Covenant House officials are asked why they're opening shop in
Anchorage when other, larger cities have bigger and more visible
runaway populations.
   ``We were invited,'' answered Brenda Moscarella, the Alaska
project manager. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Anchorage raised
enough money to buy the building and told Ritter it was his if
Covenant House would open a shelter. Ritter took the bait.
   The future Covenant House Alaska is now a ``bombshell of a
building,'' said Fred Ali, the Alaska program's executive director.
In the next few months, workers will transform it into a homey
shelter with bedrooms upstairs and a dining hall, clinic, lounge
and chapel downstairs.
   Ali has begun the search for a 40-member staff of doctors,
child-care workers, cooks and counselors. Operating costs are
expected to run just over $1 million a year, most of which will
come from Covenant House's national fundraising efforts.
   Though the organization has strong religious ties, runaways are
not proselytized, Moscarella said. ``God is one more father figure,
and they ran away from that,'' she said.
   Covenant House Alaska may differ a little from the group's other
operations. Ali said he's looking for staff comfortable with
Alaska's native culture, and Moscarella said the usual 9:30 p.m.
curfew may have to be extended in summer, when even toddlers stay
out to play under the late-night sun.
   But the blend of love and discipline that distinguishes other
Covenant House shelters will apply here, Moscarella said. No
weapons, drugs or violence will be allowed, and kids will have to
do chores and adhere to progress plans mapped out by counselors.
   The goals of those plans may be returning teen-agers home,
helping them land jobs, or sending them to drug counseling.
Nationwide, Covenant House claims a 35 percent success rate in
meeting those goals, Moscarella said.
   Some dispute that success, saying Covenant House actually
encourages runaways.
   ``I don't think it will help,'' said Allen, 17, a runaway and
former drug-pusher who now helps the Alaska Juvenile Crime
Commission counsel youths on the street. ``It's going to make kids
more likely to run away because they'll know they have some place
to stay.''
   And the police who handle runaway reports say many Anchorage
runaways are not in great danger. Investigator Ronald Emmons said
at least 90 percent fit into the ``spoiled brat'' or ``free
spirit'' category _ rebellious kids who run because they're told to
take out the garbage or vacuum the carpet.
   These manipulators generally return home after wearing out their
welcome at friends' houses, and Covenant House may not get through
to them, Emmons said. ``To them, it might just mean a picnic for 30
days,'' he said.
   But Ali and Moscarella said Covenant House is hard-headed enough
to deal with manipulators, and open-minded enough to take all
comers, spoiled brat or not.
   ``That kid may start off as a spoiled brat,'' Ali said. ``But
those kids are at risk just like anybody else. There is child
prostitution in this town, and there are kids running drugs. The
street's not a safe place to be.''

<HEAD>Economy Healthy at Mid-Year, But Inflation Looms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite sometimes conflicting signals, the U.S.
economy appears healthy through the first six months of 1988.
   The manufacturing sector has rebounded. The merchandise trade
deficit has been pared significantly. Even the stock market has
showed occasional signs of strength.
   ``The trend to growth is definitely there,'' Pierre Ellis,
senior economist with the Boston Co. Economic Advisors Inc.,
observed this past week.
   Most economists on Wall Street and inside corporate America now
agree that economic growth should continue apace, at least through
the presidential election season.
   But for the aging economic expansion, now in its sixth year, it
may be a march into the woods, not out.
   While the chills from last October's stock market crash have
dissipated somewhat, worries about inflation persist as the economy
grows strong enough to put pressure on dwindling factory capacity.
   Observers say interest rates could be pushed upward even before
the November election, and wild cards like the drought could force
the Federal Reserve to play its hand and tighten credit.
   ``We are not home free,'' said David Jones, an economist with
the investment firm Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. in New York.
   Statistics released this past week show an economy drawing its
equilibrium from a combination of strong production and sluggish
consumption.
   Operating rates at American factories rose in May to 82.9
percent, the highest level in more than eight years. Industrial
production also rose during the month, and the merchandise trade
deficit sank in April to its lowest point since December 1984.
   Such a revival might be inflationary were it not for retail
sales, which grew a lackluster 0.1 percent in May, extending a long
slump. While that persistent sluggishness concerns retailers, it is
good news to economists, who say the economy could well boil over
if consumers spend too freely.
   In the textbook view, much is right with the current scenario.
The locomotive of growth is manufacturing, not consumption. Capital
spending by business is up; consumer spending is down. Businesses
are producing at peak levels, but sales are not so frantic that
demand is outstripping supply and driving prices sky-high.
   ``It is the best kind of growth you can get,'' said Jones,
noting the contrast with the early stages of the expansion when
consumers were on a buying spree and snapping up lots of imports.
   ``The danger this year was too much consumer spending, not too
little,'' he said.
   If spending picks up, the pressure on the Fed to tighten credit
will likewise increase. The Fed has already made three small moves
to snug the credit lines in the last three months, and Ellis said
his firm predicts the central bank may have to act again before the
end of the year.
   Other factors affecting the inflation picture appear mixed: Oil
prices have been soft, but the federal budget deficit remains
naggingly high and the drought scorching America's farm belt could
push food prices markedly higher later this year.
   ``Any indication of inflation puts pressure on the Fed,'' Ellis
said.
   The nation's manufacturers are nevertheless encouraged by this
interlude of steady growth, however long it may last.
   Lynn Michaelis, chief economist for Weyerhaeuser Co., the lumber
and paper giant, said the economy's performance has vindicated
those who predicted better times despite the scare of Black Monday
in the stock market.
   ``The evidence proved the real dynamics (of the economy) were
stronger than the market indicated,'' said Michaelis.
   Despite a soft housing market in the United States, Weyerhaeuser
is selling more of its products abroad, thanks to the dollar's
recent stability.
   The company is part of the broad revival of American industry,
now showing up in government statistics. Manufacturing
corporations' after-tax profits averaged 6.3 cents per dollar of
sales in the first three months of 1988, up 43 percent from the
fourth quarter, according to numbers released this past week.
   But even the most fortunate manufacturers are moving ahead
conservatively. Boeing Co., for instance, with several
multibillion-dollar plane orders under its belt sees hurdles yet to
clear, said its chief of research, William McDonald Wallace.
   As the pressure builds on interest rates, manufacturers will
feel the pinch along with consumers, Wallace said.
   ``The rate of return on new investment has to pay,'' he said.
``It may be harder to justify new capacity.''

<HEAD>A Roller-Coaster Ride For The Credit Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates plunged and soared this past week
in roller-coaster fashion, and running the controls was the nemesis
of all bondholders: inflation.
   For the first half of the week, the mood had been downright
exhilarating. Bond prices registered one of their biggest gains of
the year _ rising around $20 per $1,000 face amount _ while yields
hit two-month lows on reports that substantial progress was being
made in lowering the nation's trade gap.
   But it was easy come, easy go. Nearly all those profits were
lost by the end of the week, and interest rates edged up past the 9
percent level again, amid concerns that overseas central banks were
seeking a tighter clamp on credit to keep their economies from
overheating.
   Runaway economic growth can lead to inflation, which erodes the
value of fixed-income securities like bonds and notes.
   Bond analysts and traders said they couldn't recall a more
volatile period in recent months than this past week.
   ``It seems like a lifetime really when you think about what's
taken place,'' said Marshall B. Front, an economist at Stein Roe &
Farnham in Chicago. ``This has been a roller coaster of a week.''
   Hardest hit by the rise and fall of bond prices and rates were
those who had stayed out of the market, despite a steady price gain
since Memorial Day, but decided it was time to invest after
Tuesday's positive trade data.
   The report by the Commerce Department said the merchandise trade
deficit shrank unexpectedly to $9.89 billion, the lowest point
since December 1984. Most encouraging to bondholders was the fact
the improvement came from a decline in imports rather than a rise
in exports, indicating that the inflation was under control.
   ``A lot of people who had first gotten into the market in any
significant way on Tuesday were just demolished. They had
instantaneous losses,'' Elliott Platt, an economist for Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said, noting the losses were
felt by institutional and individual investors alike.
   ``It was very disparaging to market psychology.''
   Behind the selloff were reports out of West Germany that the
central Bundesbank would raise a key interest rate amid growing
concern about better-than-expected economic growth in that country
and recent weakness in the mark against the dollar.
   Analysts said bond traders were worried that Japan and Britain
also would raise their rates to keep inflation in check, and that
the Federal Reserve would have to follow suit to remain
competitive. However, in Washington, the Fed indicated it was not
making any significant policy changes right now.
   Adding another negative tone to the credit markets this past
week was a government report showing the nation's factories, mines
and utilities operated at 82.9 percent of capacity in May, higher
than at any time in the past eight years. That indicated that the
manufacturing sector was heating up.
   The Midwest drought also exacerbated inflation fears as
agriculture futures soared in price, although to a lesser degree
than other factors, analysts said. ``When the drought first
happened the market was saying, `Uh, oh. It's inflation,''' Platt
said. ``The market now is beginning to distinguish between
inflation in agricultural prices and basic commodities such as base
metals.''
   Besides, he said, the markets realize there's little that could
be done to prod Mother Nature. ``A change in monetary policy isn't
going to bring rain.''

<HEAD>Higher Food Prices Foreseen But Runaway Inflation Unlikely</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD summarizing
weekly price trends.</NOTE>

   Consumers will begin feeling the Midwestern drought in the form
of higher food prices before the year is out, but even severe crop
losses wouldn't have a large impact on the overall inflation rate,
economists say.
   Irreversible damage already done to oat, wheat and corn crops
will add a half to a full percentage point to food inflation this
year and help push food prices up 5 percent to 8 percent in 1989,
according to a variety of private and government experts.
   But food purchased in grocery stores comprises less than 10
percent of the variables in the Consumer Price Index, the
government's broadest measure of household inflation. So even a 10
percent increase in food prices, which is considered unlikely,
would raise the CPI by only 1 percentage point.
   Food inflation ``could get up into the double-digit range (next
year) under extreme conditions, but even then, I don't think this
would lead to a round of rapid inflation increases,'' said Terry
Francl, an economist with the American Farm Bureau in Park Ridge,
Ill.
   As for this year, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the President's
Council of Economic Advisers, said on Thursday that a rise in food
prices over the next six months would be offset by lower prices for
other CPI components. Sprinkel said he wasn't changing his
prediction for an overall 1988 inflation rate of 4 percent.
   And in the near term, beginning as early as next month,
consumers likely will see a sharp drop in meat prices as livestock
producers sell off portions of their herds because of the high cost
of feed grains and the scarcity of good grazing land.
   The biggest unknown, of course, is how long the drought will
last. The National Weather Service has predicted a continuation of
the unusually warm, dry Midwestern weather pattern through at least
July 15, raising the possibility of a 20-25 percent loss in corn
yields as opposed to the 10 percent loss sustained to date.
   Soybeans plants, which are both hardier and later-planted than
corn, can hold out for a while longer, experts say. Spring wheat
crops have sustained heavy damage but yields of winter wheat, which
accounts for about 75 percent of all U.S. wheat, have been better
than expected in some states where the harvest is under way.
   Futures traders on Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis
commodities exchanges have been betting on a long dry spell and
bidding up prices for future delivery of grains and soybeans. On
the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures have risen about 40
percent since May 1 while soybeans have advanced about 35 percent,
and cash prices have followed suit.
   Ewen Wilson, the Agriculture Department's assistant secretary
for economics, said consumers probably would see the earliest price
increases in vegetable oils, then in cereal products.
   In fact, Kraft Inc. raised prices for margarine, salad dressings
and mayonnaise by 5 percent to 10 percent in January and February,
and Kellogg Co. has raised its cereal prices by 5 percent on two
occasions since the beginning of the year. Company spokesmen said
higher commodity prices were a factor in those decisions.
   But Wilson and others said the price that food processors pay
for raw commodities represents only about 30 percent of the retail
price of the final products. Labor, packaging, marketing,
processing costs and transportation comprise the bulk of food costs.
   ``I feel some of the consumer food companies are using the
drought as a profit-making situation for themselves,'' said Larry
Rus, a spokesman for the St. Louis-based National Corn Growers
Association.
   Livestock consume almost half of the corn and nearly all of the
soybean meal produced in the United States.
   So the most significant increases in food prices will not appear
until next year, when meat supplies tighten as a result of the
drought-related slaughter this year of animals _ especially cattle
_ that would otherwise have been kept for breeding, analysts said.
   ``The net result this year: abundant beef supplies through the
summer and fall, more than anyone expected and, in 1989, a serious
shortage,'' said Chuck Levitt, a cattle market analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Experts say abundant stockpiles will ensure against a physical
shortage of grains and soybeans even if this year's yields are
extremely small.
   And the higher prices could encourage a sharp increase in
plantings next year and may bring into production some of the 60
million acres idled this year under government price-support
programs, said Raymond Daniel, an economist with the Wefa Group
Inc., a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``We could flood the market with food by the fall of 1989,''
Daniel said. ``American agriculture has the ability to rebound
dramatically. Those are the nice things we should be reminded of.''

<HEAD>Last Words On The Summer Rally _ The Season Hasn't Started Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Has Wall Street's so-called ``summer rally''
lost its sizzle, or are stock prices merely simmering before the
heat gets turned up?
   The Dow Jones industrial average has climbed some 200 points
since May 31, and this week alone the key index set two,
consecutive post-crash highs before tumbling on fears of higher
interest rates.
   But before assessing just what impact these events may have on
what has been dubbed a summer rally, astute market watchers note
that the sultry season hasn't even begun.
   ``It's not summer yet,'' said Ronald Daino, a technical analyst
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., noting the season officially
gets under way on Tuesday.
   Depending on how things go, Daino said these recent events
``could be looked back upon as part of an initial summer rally.''
   But he's not entirely convinced that is inevitable.
   ``We still feel it requires some confirmation on whether the
market will move higher,'' Daino said.
   ``The potential is there, but I'd just like some additional
confirmation before putting both feet in the water,'' he said,
pointing to the drought's effect on commodity prices and the credit
markets as areas of concern.
   Plunging bond prices obliterated the 32-point gain the Dow
posted in back-to-back sessions this week that pushed the key
average to two post-crash highs.
   Those who expected the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to
remain solidly above 2,100 and use that mark as a springboard for a
further advance saw those plans evaporate in one brief session.
   Rumors out of Europe that West Germany and even possibly Japan
are considering hiking interest rates ignited fears that the
Federal Reserve might be forced to follow suit to support the
dollar.
   The news deflated the bond market, and ripple effects spread to
equities.
   But analysts shrugged it off, saying the stock market was
overdue for a selloff, that it needed a breather and that the
overall trend is ``constructive.''
   Over the week, the Dow rose 2.31 points to 2,104.02. Friday's
volume of 343.92 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,
attributed to moves to capture dividends and the quarterly
``triple-witching hour,'' was the busiest session this year and the
fifth heaviest ever. Volume averaged 201.64 million shares a day.
   The NYSE composite index was off 0.05 at 152.84; the NASDAQ
composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 0.67 to
386.92; and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell
3.63 to 305.70.
   Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, cautioned that he is both
``amazed and chagrined at how quickly pessimism has turned to
optimism about everything.''
   A better-than-expected trade deficit report, which heartened
investors because both imports and exports had declined in April,
should have been tempered with caution over factory utilization,
which edged up beyond expectations in May, Goldman said.
   The implication is that booming business could result in
shortages of some goods and price increases to compensate.
   Still, investors hot to perpetuate the ``summer'' rally are
tossing off concerns about an overheated economy.
   ``Everybody is looking up as far as the stock market is
concerned,'' Goldman said. ``That's a sign the market is
over-bought and over-believed and that we're getting into a
high-risk area.''
   Goldman noted that optimism breeds declines in the market while
pessimism is fodder for rallies.

   Here are some commodity price trends for the past week:
   Grain and soybean futures advanced sharply on the Chicago Board

   The contract for July delivery of wheat settled Friday at $3.81{
a bushel compared with $3.73} a week earlier; July corn soared to
$3.09{ a bushel from $2.57}; July oats rallied to $2.98 a bushel
from $2.60; and July soybeans rocketed to $9.71{ a bushel from

   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle for June delivery fell to 70.22 cents a pound from
72.32 cents; August feeder cattle plunged to 71.80 cents a pound
from 75.25 cents; June hogs slipped to 49.80 cents a pound from
51.15 cents; and frozen pork bellies plummeted to 43.10 cents a
pound from 50.07 cents.

New York.
   Gold rose to $458.30 a troy ounce from $453.30; silver bounded
to $7.255 a troy ounce from $7.015.
   Energy futures had a mixed week on the New York Mercantile

   Oil prices closed lower as buyers left the
market and a negative atmosphere settled in.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, finished 21 cents
lower Friday at $16.45 per 42-gallon barrel. On Thursday, the July
contract rose 13 cents amid rumors that Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini had died.
   The near-term contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline slipped
0.22 cent a gallon to close at 49.97 cents, and home heating oil
declined 0.48 cent to finish at 43.64 cents a gallon.
   The market had a bearish tone and seemed to be in search of a
trading range, said Richard Redoglia, a trader for Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures. He predicted that range would fall below $17.20 for
crude, and could even dip below $16 a barrel.
   Technical buying from early in the week had dried up, he said.
   There's ``probably no reason to be an aggressive buyer,''
Redoglia said. ``People will look at rallies as opportunities to
sell in the short term.''

<HEAD>Single-Family Home Building Hits Three-Year Low as Interest Rates
Rise</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has reported a surprising drop in May home
building, while the ongoing drought keeps pressure on commodities
prices.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that apartment and house
building plunged 12.2 percent last month as single-family home
construction slumped to the lowest level in more than three years.
   Economists, who were surprised by the steepness of the nose
dive, blamed rising interest rates and high home prices,
particularly in the Northeast section of the country where
construction starts fell 22.3 percent.
   Housing activity is closely watched because it often is a
harbinger of the direction of the economy as a whole. However,
analysts cautioned against overreacting to one month's report and
said they expected at least a modest rebound this summer.
   The report had little effect on the stock market, where the Dow
Jones industrial average of 30 stocks rose 9.78 points to 2,104.02.
Trading of nearly 344 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, heaviest of the year, was attributed to dividend plays
and technical factors associated with ``triple witching hour''
expiration of futures and options contracts.
   Inflation fears continued to plague the credit markets, where
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond edged above 9 percent.
   The biggest moves in the financial markets were again in the
commodities pits, where soybean futures prices soared to 11-year
highs on the Chicago Board of Trade and corn futures advanced the
daily limit for the fourth consecutive session in anticipation of
more dry weather and deeper crop losses. Lumber prices tumbled in
reaction to the disappointing report on housing starts.
   The Commerce Department's report said the May decline dragged
overall housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.38 million units, compared with a rate of 1.58 million
units in April.
   Single-family construction dropped 9.2 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 988,000 after dipping 7.2 percent in April.
   Multifamily building starts, a volatile category, dropped 18.9
percent to a rate of 396,000 units in May, bouncing off a 36.7
percent increase a month earlier.
   Apartment building has been in the doldrums for more than a year
because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax law that made
investment in rental housing less profitable.
   It was the most precipitous drop in total housing construction
since December's 15.8 percent fall and the lowest level in activity
since January.
   Construction of single-family units have not been lower since
August 1984, when units were begun at a 967,000 annual rate.
   ``Mortgage interest rates were rising pretty quickly during the
month of May and that rise may have scared a lot of builders into
pulling back,'' said Richard W. Peach, deputy chief economist of
the Mortgage Bankers of America.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., rates on
30-year, fixed rate mortgages climbed from an average of 10.05
percent early in April to 10.58 percent late in May. The averages
do not include add-on fees known as points.
   Rates have eased so far this month, averaging 10.35 percent this
week. However, most economists are predicting rising rates through
the end of the year.

   Texaco Inc. officials say they're confident
they have won their proxy war against Carl C. Icahn. But the wily
financier, who is also the oil giant's biggest shareholder, says he
thinks it could go either way.
   Top executives of the nation's third-largest oil company and
Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco's 243 million outstanding
shares, were speaking after the company's annual meeting here
Friday.
   Icahn's pursuit of five of Texaco's 14 board seats has been
closely watched by shareholders and the investment community,
mainly because he has vowed to use those seats _ if he wins _ to
pressure the company to put his $60-a-share, $12.4 billion buyout
offer before the shareholders.
   The victor will not be known for weeks, however, because it will
take that long to sort through and tabulate the ballots.
   ``Our advisors tell us the likely outcome of the vote is that we
win,'' said James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president. Asked about the
margin of victory, he replied: ``We think it is substantial.''
   Icahn was a little more cautious, saying he thought the outcome
would hang on a block of shares controlled by the New York
investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts Co.
   Kohlberg Kravis has not made public how much of its original 12
million-share stake it voted, or which way.
   ``If it went with us, we definitely win,'' Icahn said. ``If they
abstained, I believe we win. But if it went against us, we
definitely lose.''
   Wall Street appeared to be betting on management. It sent
Texaco's stock $1.50 lower to close at $48 a share Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Final ballots were cast after Icahn and top Texaco officials
made their final pitches during the annual meeting, which was held
in a packed hotel ballroom.
   Speaking at his own lectern set off to the side, the takeover
specialist criticized Texaco's management for refusing to let
shareholders vote on his offer for the Texaco shares he does not
already own.
   ``If we're elected, what we will do is keep our offer out
there,'' he said. ``Why should you not be allowed to decide? Simply
because management does not want to take the risk of losing its
position, its prerogatives.''
   At $60 a share, Icahn's bid puts a $14.6 billion value on the
company. Adding the $1.2 billion he paid for his stake to the $12.4
billion he is offering for the shares he does not own, the $13.6
billion total would amount to the largest buyout in corporate
history.
   The crowd, estimated at slightly more than 1,000, generally
favored management. Texaco has many employees in the Tulsa area, a
fact that did not go unnoticed by its mayor, Rodger A. Randle, who
rose to praise the company during a question-and-answer session.
   Many shareholders sported buttons featuring the familiar Texaco
star. Some went one better, dressing in various combinations of red
and white, the corporate colors.
   Another indication of the crowd's attitude came early in the
meeting, after Icahn protested when Texaco Chairman Alfred C.
DeCrane Jr. interrupted him to say he had exceeded his time limit
for speaking.
   ``A manifestation of the inflexibility that has caused Texaco
its problems,'' Icahn sniffed _ drawing mixed boos and cheers.
   Kinnear, speaking for the company's slate of directors, touted
the ``spectacular progress'' it had made over the last 18 months,
during which Texaco emerged in April from a year under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
   The keystone of its reorganization plan was a $3 billion payment
to Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit resulting from Texaco's 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co. after Pennzoil had made earlier moves
to acquire Getty.
   The plan includes sales of $5 billion of marginally profitable
assets and a $1.7 billion distribution to shareholders.
   ``Our plan ... is based on the building of value, both today and
for the future,'' Kinnear said, charging that the Icahn group's
true intention ``is that they be designated as the brokers for the
breakup and sale of this company's assets.''
   Several shareholders expressed skepticism about Icahn's
intentions, even though the offer does propose about $10 more per
share than Texaco's stock has been trading for recently.
   ``If you turned (the company) over to Mr. Icahn, it would be
like giving your Stradivarius to a gorilla,'' said Bill Lenz,
referring to the prized antique violins made by the craftsman of
the same name.
   Several Texaco distributors and wholesalers also spoke, calling
for support of management while noting that Icahn's actions had
harmed their businesses.
   ``Some of my dealers are looking for another supplier (and)
heating oil accounts are questioning whether I'll be able to supply
heating oil this winter, said Carlos R. Leffler, a Pennsylvania
distributor.
   But it was not all clear sailing for management.
   Reflecting a palpable current of shareholder unhappiness, Bill
Collallas, a shareholder from Cherry Hill, N.J., criticized the
comany's ``shoddy and incompetent management'' over the past four
years.
   ``You're demeaning my intelligence by refusing my right to vote
on Mr. Icahn's proposal. And I resent it,'' he told Kinnear and
DeCrane.
