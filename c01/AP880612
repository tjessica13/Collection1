<HEAD>Army Called In To Help Control Blaze; Damage Estimated At $90
Million</HEAD>

   A fire in the country's
largest shopping center burned for a second day Sunday with losses
rising to $90 million and the army ordered to help control the
blaze.
   Lt. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, armed forces minister, ordered
soldiers to join the firemen immediately after visiting the Plaza
Naco shopping center, located in the capital's upper class Naco
district, Saturday evening.
   The police also helped firemen keep the blaze from spreading to
neighboring buildings.
   Fire Department spokesman Buenaventura Torres said Sunday that
the fire was under control, but that the dense smoke and lack of
water and equipment such as oxygen masks and protective clothing
hindered firemen's efforts.
   Some firemen fainted and suffered cuts and bruises, but no other
injuries were reported.
   The fire, one of the largest recorded in this nation of 6.5
million, began early Saturday morning and destroyed most of the
more than 100 shops, movie theaters, offices, banks and restaurants
in the mall.
   Firemen said the blaze was caused by faulty wiring in an
auxiliary power plant turned on during a power failure.
   Shopping center administrators and shop owners estimated damage
at about $90 million.

   Bertha Shefton closed her eyes and
shuddered as she relived the moment.
   The 80-year-old widow owed $103.44 on her water bill, and city
utility truck No. 986 had just arrived at her small, white stucco
bungalow to cut off the water.
   Doing without water would be hard enough for a frail old woman
in the suffocating subtropical heat and humidity of south Florida,
but Mrs. Shefton also cares for a granddaughter who has lost her
left leg to diabetes and must undergo kidney dialysis three times a
week.
   ``I tried to explain that somebody had stolen my Social Security
check and that I'd pay the bill as soon as my next check came in,''
Mrs. Shefton told a visiting reporter. ``They told me they were
only doing their job.
   ``It was plain to see those boys didn't want to do it. They said
they were real sorry, but it was still awful to watch them drive
away and know our water had been cut off.''
   But what the crew did next has made the four men local heroes
and brought in donations that should make Mrs. Shefton secure for a
long time: they drove back, turned the water on and scraped up
enough cash to pay her bill.
   ``When the word got out about what happened, a local plumbing
contractor volunteered to pay Mrs. Shefton's water bill for a year.
Another local company is paying her electric bills,'' said Benny
Scott, who supervises city water department crews.
   Scott and the three members of the city's celebrated utility
crew _ Joe Johnson, Mark Craddock and Lyn Roberts _ visited Mrs.
Shefton one recent steamy afternoon. They stopped by to say hello
and see how she was faring.
   ``These are my friends,'' Mrs. Shefton said, giving Scott a hug.
``These fellows are my heroes, they're the ones who started the
wheels turning for me.''
   The wheels began turning Mrs. Shefton's way almost immediately
after the utility truck pulled away from the curb in front of her
house on April 14.
   ``We decided we just couldn't leave her like that,'' Johnson
said. ``It was the middle of the month, and that meant it would be
more than two weeks before the old lady's next check would arrive.
It was plain that she and her granddaughter really needed help.''
   Cutting off water service in such a climate makes people
desperate, the crew members said.
   ``Some of them get real nasty and threaten to shoot you or sic
their dogs on you,'' said Roberts. ``Others get down and beg you
not to do it, which only makes it worse.''
   Mrs. Shefton had merely asked for enough time to fill her
bathtub and a few pots and pans with water before service was shut
off.
   ``It really touched me,'' Johnson said.
   So the crew members called their office on the truck radio and
found out how much Mrs. Shefton owed. Then they began pulling money
out of their pockets.
   ``Joe and I each put up $15 and Willie Hargrett, our foreman,
pitched in $20,'' Roberts said. ``Some other fellows at the office
also contributed a few dollars, and Benny Scott put up the
remaining $33.44.''
   Craddock put in a dollar.
   ``But that was every penny he had,'' said Roberts. ``It was a
gift from his heart.''
   News media soon picked up the story.
   ``Since then we've gotten dozens of calls and letters from all
over the place,'' Scott said. ``People from as far away as
California have sent money and checks for Mrs. Shefton; a local guy
even stopped by and gave us a check for the $103.44 we had put up.''
   Scott said he has turned over all the contributions, including
the $103.44 check, to Mrs. Shefton's church, where a fund has been
set up for her.
   ``So far, we've received more than $700,'' the Rev. Otis Sample,
pastor of the Mt. Calvary Baptist Church, said recently. ``We'll
use the money to help her pay her bills.''
   Mrs. Shefton lost her husband, Izell, a year ago, and she and
her granddaughter, Mercideen Pugh, 37, live on a monthly income of
$952.
   Mrs. Shefton, a former domestic worker who cleaned the homes of
Pompano Beach's more affluent families for 40 years, said she
doesn't know what to make of all the help and support she has
received.
   ``It's wonderful, but don't forget that it all started with
these boys here,'' she said, pointing to Johnson, Roberts, Craddock
and Scott.
   ``We were happy to do it,'' replied Scott, who said he, too, is
somewhat flabbergasted by all the attention, including letters of
commendation from the mayor.
   ``We didn't have no idea it would turn out like this,'' he said.
``We were just trying to help a nice old lady out of a jam.''

<TEXT>
   At the end, she was alone, hiding from the
world she'd shattered that day in wild gunfire. Outside, the tears
and trauma had just begun. Inside, Laurie Dann shot one last time
and her torment was over.
   No one saw her place the .32-caliber revolver in her mouth or
heard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of terror.
   Three weeks after she killed a young boy at Hubbard Woods
Elementary School and ended her life in the house where she had
held police at bay, authorities are still trying to piece together
the puzzle of Laurie Dann's life.
   ``We want to answer the question why,'' said Winnetka Police Lt.
Joseph Sumner. ``What made it happen? How did it happen? We owe
that to the citizens and the community. We owe it to the families
of victims. If you put yourself in their spot, you'd want to know
why.
   ``It's very possible she may have taken that to the grave with
her,'' he added. ``We can hopefully come down with a position of
`This is probably why.'
   Laurie Dann's road to tragedy was lined with signs of trouble
ahead, most posted in the last two years.
   In that time, she was divorced, forced out of an apartment and
charged with shoplifting. She lied about her name, age and
occupation; she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student.
   She was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hang-up or
threatening phone calls to her ex-husband, his family and others.
She was charged once, but the case was dropped due to insufficient
evidence.
   Students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat under
seat cushions, wore knit gloves when she ate, ran her shower for
hours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where she
was called ``psycho'' and ``elevator lady.''
   ``She was definitely a very, very confused woman,'' Sumner said.
   Dangerous, too, her ex-husband and others feared. But even as
they were contacting the FBI, prosecutors and police, several North
Shore families were unwittingly hiring Dann as a babysitter.
   Two days before the May 20 tragedy, Arizona prosecutors were
ready to charge Dann with making threatening phone calls to a
former boyfriend. Illinois authorities were working a similar case.
The FBI was closing in, too.
   They moved too late. By then, Dann had killed 8-year-old
Nicholas Corwin. She shot five other children at the school and a
20-year-old man who tried to disarm her when she burst into his
family's house. She barricaded herself there and committed suicide.
   ``I don't see why this had to happen and get this far,'' Susan
Taylor, her former sister-in law, said on ABC's ``Nightline.''
Taylor said Dann called her hundreds of times, saying things like
```Susie, Susie, Susie, you are going to die.'''
   Dann, police say, left behind a trail of poison: 31 packets of
juice and other foods, 29 of them contaminated with arsenic or
lead, sent to her ex-husband, psychiatrist, families she worked
for, two Northwestern University fraternity houses and others.
   Police believe she may once have known someone at the frat
houses but don't know why she directed her poison at acquaintances,
her gun at strangers.
   It wasn't the only paradox in Dann's life.
   Children she tended adored her, but adults came to fear her.
   She was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes, but she
left rotting meat behind in one apartment with urine-stained floors.
   Still, some say they detected no hint of growing fury.
   ``She really was a pleasant ... quiet person. ... She wasn't
this ghoulish person all her life,'' said Peter Solber, one
attorney who represented her in divorce proceedings. ``She wasn't
the monster she turned out to be.''
   For most of her 30 years, Laurie Dann lived an unremarkable life.
   Laurie Wasserman, who had an older brother, Mark, graduated from
prestigious New Trier East High School. Her father, a successful
accountant, and mother live in Glencoe on the North Shore, where
$500,000 mansions, private beaches along Lake Michigan and
three-car garages are not uncommon.
   In high school ``she was really quiet, kind of withdrawn. She
held her head low,'' said ex-classmate Margie Guiarelli. ``There
was always kind of a wall in-between. ... She never really gave you
eye contact. She was nervous when she talked to you.''
   She took classes at four universities _ Drake, Arizona,
Northwestern and Wisconsin-Madison _ over six years. At Arizona,
she majored in home economics but did not graduate after four
years. Later, she took courses in acting, dance and playwriting.
   At Arizona, Dann pledged Alpha Delta Pi sorority, where sisters
remembered her as introverted and recalled how she would make
several dates for one night, then cancel all but one.
   ``I just perceived her to be a sweet little girl,'' Denise
Shimer Janes, a former chapter president, told The Arizona Star.
   For two years, Dann dated a premed student at Arizona, who later
claimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls. His identity
has not been made public.
   However, the man's friend, Louis Spivack, an Arizona prosecutor
who double-dated with them, remembers Dann as ``aloof, perhaps a
little unfriendly, possessive'' but exhibiting no especially
strange behavior.
   In 1982, two years after returning to the Chicago area, she
married Russell Dann, who worked in his family's insurance firm.
   Solber said his client, who was 5-foot-3, described herself and
her husband as both ``little and cute. (She said) they looked like
brother and sister. That was her perception.''
   The Danns bought a $275,000 home, but the marriage crumbled by
1986. She saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage.
   Their parting was bitter. Dann, who had taken a marksmanship
course in her college days, bought a .357-caliber Magnum, saying
she needed it for protection. A worried Russell Dann alerted
police, who contacted her parents. Wasserman told officers the gun
would be locked in a safety deposit box.
   The .357 was one of three guns she carried into the school.
   Dann also accused her husband of assault, breaking into their
home and setting it on fire, charges never substantiated.
   Russell Dann, in turn, asserted she sneaked into his apartment
as he slept Sept. 30, 1986, and stabbed him in the chest with an
ice pick. He said he never saw his assailant and later claimed his
ex-wife had admitted to the attack.
   But Russell failed a lie detector test and refused to take a
second, while Laurie passed, said Michael Waller, assistant Lake
County state's attorney.

   Police found packaging for an ice pick in the house the Danns
had shared, but Waller said no fingerprints were on the pick
itself. Waller also said reports indicated the doctor and nurse who
treated Russell at the hospital noted the wound could have been
self-inflicted.
   No charges were filed. ``There was just no case there,'' Waller
said.
   According to divorce records, Dann was to receive a lump sum of
$125,000 and $1,250 monthly for three years.
   After the shootings, Russell Dann appeared on ``Nightline'' at
his request and phoned a radio talk show to urge tougher gun
control. Since then, he has declined further comment.
   He did acknowledge to The Associated Press, however, that ``some
people think I was the bad guy.''
   Laurie Dann's life began unraveling faster and faster in 1986.
   That summer, she dated John Childs, whose mother, Alexandra,
lived near her parents. She was ``very pretty ... very preppy ...
but very shy,'' Mrs. Childs said, and had unusual habits: she
washed her hands often and touched things only with a napkin.
   She said her son ``noticed too many problems. ... She'd be very
friendly, then it would be, `Don't touch me, don't touch me.'''
   That fall, Spivack said his friend, now a doctor, began getting
harassing calls he believed were from Dann _ six years after their
breakup.
   Spivack said Dann somehow obtained the doctor's unlisted number;
the FBI said she knew where the doctor was working. Spivack said
the calls stopped in 1987 after an attorney wrote a letter to her
parents' home.
   Last summer, Dann's father intervened when Northwestern
University officials, reacting to repeated harassment complaints,
including reports she left raw meat under lounge cushions, moved to
evict her. She left the graduate student apartment she was
subletting.
   Dann then posted notices in local groceries, seeking babysitting
jobs. Many families said she had a terrific rapport with children,
but Wasserman twice made restitution to employer families after his
daughter was suspected of stealing food or clothes, police say.
   In January, Dann moved to The Towers in Madison, Wis., a
dormitory one block off the University of Wisconsin campus. Most
residents were freshmen, more than a decade younger than Dann.
   Her suitemate said Dann told her she was a journalism student
from Northwestern, but she never carried books or attended classes.
Dann explained to dorm neighbors she wore gloves when she ate
because she was allergic or sensitive to metal objects.
   The suitemate, who asked not to be identified, said after
several incidents she became uncomfortable and moved out.
   Other residents say Dann avoided sidewalk cracks, watched TV all
day and rode the elevators for hours, carrying a note pad. Student
Brian Soifer said he heard she wept once when some guys teased her
on the elevator.
   ``Everybody told stories about her,'' he said. ``She must have
known people were pointing at her and talking about her.''
   ``She just looked like she was lost,'' said resident Scott
Tzinberg.
   Amid mounting harassment complaints, meanwhile, the
investigations continued.
   Waller said December phone records showed that 55 pre-dawn calls
lasting a minute or less were made in 4{ hours from the Wasserman
home.
   In March, Dann reportedly stopped seeing her psychiatrist, who
had prescribed lithium carbonate to treat depression. She was also
taking an experimental drug called clomipramine, used for
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
   That month, a woman who had known the Danns when they were
married and had received hundreds of hang-up calls since 1986
picked up her phone to hear: `You are going to die.' The woman, who
asked that her name not be used, suspected Dann in all the calls.
   On March 14, Dann was arrested in Madison, accused of stealing
four wigs and other items, said Capt. Jeff Frye. He said Dann
initially gave police a fake name and a Michigan address. Once she
gave her real name, she still gave phony information on her student
status and address, he said.
   On May 9, Spivack said his friend answered the phone and heard a
female voice say ``she would come out and stab them and make it
look like his wife had done it.'' The FBI was given a
tape-recording of the call.
   The night of May 15, Frye said Dann was found in a dormitory
trash room curled in a fetal position, wrapped in a plastic bag and
dripping with sweat.
   When police arrived, however, she was asleep in her room. Aware
of the Arizona investigation, the FBI was called. They arrived the
next morning. She was gone.
   After the shooting, police searched her belongings and found a
picture of her with her ex-husband, scraps of paper with names,
rough drafts of threatening notes to the Arizona doctor, supportive
letters from her parents, four catalog cards from a library
referring to books on poisoning, a list of words including
``schools'' and ``both,'' and a white smock she apparently took
from a hospital where she'd been treated as an outpatient, said FBI
agent Kent Miller in Madison.
   Miller said Dann was suspected of stealing arsenic and other
chemicals from a hospital lab in March.
   Plans in Arizona to seek an indictment May 18 were delayed to
coordinate legal action with other states.
   Two days later, Laurie Dann, wearing a University of Arizona
Medical Center shirt with a skeleton on it, reached the end of her
road to tragedy.
   ``I feel very frustrated,'' Spivack said. ``We were within a few
days of averting this. We ran out of time.''

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside the beltway that circles
Washington, House Speaker Jim Wright is the target of a barrage of
charges of ethical misconduct. But inside Loop 820 that circles
Fort Worth, his home district, it's business as usual.
   Aides in Wright's Texas office aren't hearing complaints about
the congressman, they say, just the usual requests from
constituents seeking help with Social Security checks or a passport.
   And local Republican leaders say the charges alone won't hurt
the powerful Democrat.
   ``Where there's a lot of smoke you ought to at least look for
the fire, but I don't think the smoke is going to cause him
problems,'' said Jim Ryan, GOP chairman in Tarrant County.
   Ryan said the ethics investigation ``may plow him under, or
vindicate him and make him a hero.''
   The House Ethics Committee voted unanimously Friday to
investigate charges lodged by Wright's political enemy, Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and Common Cause, a non-profit group that monitors
government ethics.
   They allege that Wright lobbied on behalf of oil interests in a
case in which he had a financial stake, that he received unusually
high royalties for a book he wrote that was published in 1985 by a
longtime associate and campaign contractor, that he used a Capitol
Hill staffer and office funds to help draft the book, and that he
used a Fort Worth condominium, owned by the family of a business
partner, without having to pay a monthly rent.
   Larry Shannon, who directs Wright's district office, said
Thursday the office has received 12 telephone calls in the past two
weeks concerning the salvo of charges fired Gingrich.
   Of those 12, two were negative, while the rest were encouraging,
similar to comments Shannon said he received while making rounds in
the conservative 12th District that stretches over the northern
two-thirds of Tarrant County.
   The district, about 30 miles west of Dallas, is known for its
rowdy frontier image, exemplified by its Fort Worth Stockyards
tourist attraction.
   But the city's collar has whitened with high-technology
industries such as Tandy Corp., Bell Helicopter and General
Dynamics.
   Local Democrats say their Republican counterparts have little to
complain about because Wright has been an effective congressman for
the district.
   Since his arrival in Congress in 1955, Wright has been a
prodigious provider of federal dollars for Fort Worth, especially
in the form of defense contracts, and he has one of the most
politically safe districts in the nation. He faces no Republican
opponent in the November election.
   ``He is a supporter of his friends, even his Republican
friends,'' said Frank Barron, a longtime Tarrant County Democrat.
   Wright and other Democrats say the charges are part of a GOP
plot to embarrass Wright and the party before the Democratic
National Convention next month in Atlanta and to take pressure off
Vice President George Bush and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
Wright has been named chairman of the convention.
   Shannon said that when he was eating at a restaurant a man
approached him and said: ``They're picking on that boy of ours up
there, aren't they? You tell them to leave him alone.''
   Recently, constituent John Ridgeway went to Wright's Fort Worth
office to see if the staff could help him find a certain kind of
government stamp for his son's stamp collection. Ridgeway, 39, said
the ethics charges don't bother him.
   ``I read the newspapers every day, but the fact is I don't think
we could have a better person up there. He's done a lot for the
area,'' he said.
   Ridgeway dismissed the ethics charges as based on politics.
``Every four years someone up there has to start slinging mud,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Vermont First In Nation To Enact Subsidy For Farmers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On a small dairy farm tucked under the Canadian
border, the ``For Sale'' sign has come down. Vermonters, worried
that the small farmer might become an endangered species, hope it
is the beginning of a trend.
   What prompted Gary Jacobs to change his mind and stay on his
100-cow farm was the promise of $5,000 cash this year from the
state.
   Most of Vermont's 2,700 farmers are eligible for the subsidy
under the first such program ever enacted by a state. Farmers have
until Wednesday to apply; a maximum of $5,000 will be paid each
farmer.
   The subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such a
large role in the heritage of one of the nation's most rural states
would soon vanish from the landscape.
   The fear was well-founded: 10 percent of Vermont's 3,000 farms
went out of business in the past two years.
   ``It's viewed as being rather revolutionary,'' said Vermont
Agriculture Commissioner Ronald Allbee of the new program. ``It's
viewed as, `I can't believe Vermont did it.'''
   ``I think this is a ray of sunlight to all the dairy farmers in
the state of Vermont,'' said Ronald Morrissette of East Randolph,
the first to sign up for the subsidy.
   The problem facing dairy farmers was simple: The price of milk
was falling; costs were rising. Between 1981 and 1987, the price
farmers received for their milk declined, in real dollars, from
$13.90 to $12.43 per hundred pounds of milk. More than 40 percent
of the farms in the state were operating below the break-even point.
   The culprit was a federal policy designed to reduce a milk
surplus in the West. The policy, farmers said, was ruining dairy
farms in New England, where there was a shortage of milk.
   As 1988 began, Vermont farmers endured another reduction in the
federal price support, the price the federal ensures farmers for
their milk, and faced the prospect of more cuts. The state decided
to step in.
   At first Gov. Madeleine Kunin opposed the one-year $7.5 million
program as bad fiscal policy that wouldn't give farmers the
long-term help they needed.
   But lawmakers and citizens groups _ seeing state coffers
overflowing from a strong economy _ rallied around the subsidy,
concerned that the loss of farmers and farmland would change the
face of Vermont and remove land treasured for hunting, fishing,
trapping and sightseeing.
   ``They're the custodians of the countryside,'' state Sen.
Francis Howrigan, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
said of the farmers.
   The subsidy program will pay farmers 50 cents for every hundred
pounds of milk they produce up to 1 million pounds, which is more
than the average farm produces. It's available to farmers who
receive at least half their gross income from farming, make less
than $32,000 a year, and belong to a milk cooperative or an
11-state dairy cartel that's trying to win a higher milk price for
Northeast farmers.
   The program faces a legal challenge from a group of farmers who
say the program discriminates against those few who do not belong
to co-ops.
   The Legislature this year also enacted some long-term help for
farmers that will give them big breaks on their property taxes in
future years. The state will pay up to approximately 90 percent of
farmers' local property taxes if they agree to continue farming.
   The tax program covers all non-dairy farmers this year; next
year, when the dairy subsidy is eliminated, it will apply to dairy
farmers.
   But lawmakers and farmers say the state cannot afford to
continue its $7.5 million subsidy and that the true solution can
come only from the Congress.
   ``It's the finger in a dike that is getting an ever-wider
fissure,'' said New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner Stephen
Taylor. ``I think we're in a dire situation, and I don't think the
state of Vermont has the resources to carry that farmer for a long
period of time.''
   Jacobs expects to triple the value of his $5,000 payment from
the state by using it to grow feed, one of his rapidly rising
expenses.
   ``It's going to make a difference, and it gives you a chance,''
he said, surveying the corn field that lies in the shadow of Jay
Peak, a popular ski area. ``It may turn around.''

   Stephen Cox is off to see the Munchkins, the
wonderful Munchkins of Oz. But he has no Yellow Brick Road to
follow in his search for the little people who greeted Dorothy in
the 1939 film ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``It may not be easy to find some of them,'' said the writer.
``I know there are some still living, but they've sort of fallen
into the woodwork.''
   Cox is writing a book about the little people who sang and
danced with the young Judy Garland in the musical based on L. Frank
Baum's magical tale of good and bad witches, a bumbling wizard and
Dorothy's lovable friends, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion.
   Cox's book, ``Oz Remembered: Memoirs of the Munchkins,'' will be
published by E.P. Dutton of New York and released next year to
coincide with the 50th anniversary of the MGM movie classic.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are
fascinated by the Munchkins,'' said Jeanne Martinet, a Dutton
editor.
   So far, Cox has located about 30 of the 124 people who played
Munchkinland villagers and soldiers. He has spent days poring over
telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but
old address books and faded sign-in sheets from long-ago lunches on
the movie's set.
   ``I figure it's about time to give them some credit,'' Cox said,
adding that the movie credits gave them little mention. ``All it
said was `The Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.' Their scene lasts
about 10 minutes, but I think it's the most enchanting part of the
whole movie.''
   For Margaret Pellegrini, being a Munchkin meant a chance to meet
movie stars and other people of her size.
   She was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now, she
said recently from her home in Glendale, Ariz. ``Meeting up with
all the little people, because I hadn't been around very many
little people _ it was just a great experience.''
   ``I didn't think it would be so popular. Of course, I was
excited about it and I was thinking, `Oh boy, I'm going to
Hollywood.'''
   ``A lot of the Munchkins think: A book on the Munchkins? Is that
really going to sell?'' Cox said. ``They don't realize how popular
they are.''
   Most of the men and women who played the Munchkins were
recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by Leo Singer
and Major Doyle. But many of them had never acted before and some
were from Europe and didn't speak English, Cox said.
   A few of them went on in show business, but most eventually
settled into other jobs, he said.
   Mickey Carroll of St. Louis, now 69, continued acting for a
time, then returned home to the family business selling grave
monuments. Parnell St. Aubin opened a tavern in Chicago called the
Midget's Club and walked along the bar serving drinks. Meinhardt
Raabe went on to portray Little Oscar for Oscar Mayer lunchmeats
and made promotional appearances around the country.
   They're all proud of their parts in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Cox
said. ``They're proud of being a part of one of the best motion
pictures ever made. A new generation discovers `The Wizard of Oz'
every year.''
   But for all the fond memories of working with Miss Garland and
the other stars, there were problems, Cox said.
   Pellegrini recalled heavy, elaborate costumes and layers of
makeup. Lewis Croft of Idaho Falls, Idaho, remembered how it
smarted when the plastic ``skin'' that made the men look bald was
ripped off like a piece of tape at the end of each day.
   Cox said he has heard a story about one Munchkin _ an actor
nicknamed ``The Count'' and well-known for his drinking _ who
visited the bathroom one day and wound up falling into the toilet
and being stuck there for 45 minutes.
   ``Some of the little people are telling tall tales,'' he said.
``But some of it's good for legends.''

   Gov. Mario Cuomo has a $900 million problem,
California Gov. George Deukmejian's is $2 billion and Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' just grew to more than $400
million in Massachusetts.
   State budget deficits are sweeping the nation as a result of
what almost everyone thought was a good idea _ federal tax reform
that has resulted in a slump in capital gains tax collections.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin announced last week that he would
have to pare as much as $60 million from his budget proposal
because of a one-shot ``revenue slump'' brought on by
lower-than-expected tax collections.
   Connecticut budget chief Anthony Milano warned state agencies
last week that sluggish revenue collections could mean the state
will start its new fiscal year July 1 with a deficit.
   In Pennsylvania, state officials say that total revenues are up
but that taxes on sales of personal investments, also known as
capital gains, are down about 8 percent.
   There are indications that other states that rely heavily on
personal income taxes for revenue may have similar problems as the
year goes on, said Dall Forsythe, Cuomo's budget director.
   Cuomo has even proposed cutting funding for the state's Council
on Children and Families, which is run by his wife, Matilda.
   Most states reaped tax revenue windfalls from 1986 when
investors rushed to take advantage of tax breaks that the new
federal rules were designed to erase when they took effect Jan. 1,
1987.
   Then the tax changes sent taxpayers running to their accountants
for help in reducing their taxes, and the taking of capital gains
slowed, reducing capital gains tax revenues.
   In some states, such as Pennsylvania, budget officials lowered
their revenue estimates forthis year in anticipation of a possible
shortfall.
   The Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry complained
that Gov. Robert Casey's administration was not liberal enough in
estimating the benefits of federal tax reform.
   ``We had a discussion with the Pennsylvania Chamber on how much
of a windfall we would get and we said, `None,''' said Karl Ross,
Casey's deputy secretary for policy and analysis. ``That's what we
budgeted for and that's what's happening.''
   The fiscal problems are causing political headaches for Dukakis
and Deukmejian.
   Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, based his
campaign on his abilities as a manager. He must now cut his budget
because his numbers were wrong.
   Republican Deukmejian, who has been mentioned as a possible
running mate for George Bush, had proposed $800 million in revenue
raisers to help close his budget gap, estimated at about $1 billion
this year and $1 billion next year. But he withdrew the proposal,
angry at reporters for calling it a tax increase.
   Democrat Cuomo doesn't have to run for re-election until 1990
and has been quick to propose some politically unpopular spending
cuts.
   Cuomo said last week that the shortfall could present a good
lesson for this year's presidential campaign by demonstrating the
different approaches for dealing with it.
   ``The deficit he has is just the right size,'' Cuomo said of
Dukakis. ``I think this is a break for Dukakis. He will now show
you how he handles a deficit. He will do it swiftly, cleanly,
effectively.''
   Massachusetts' Democrat-controlled Legislature has tentatively
passed a $40 million cigarette tax hike and a revision of state tax
law to conform it to federal law that would increase personal
income taxes by $70 million this year. Dukakis is not yet committed
to the cigarette tax.
   There have also been cursory discussions of other ``sin taxes''
on liquor and entertainment to close Massachusetts' $400 million
shortfall.
   Dukakis already has ordered that $233 million in spending be
postponed, that state employment be frozen and that agencies
prepare for possible personnel cuts through attrition.
Massachusetts' total budget is about $11 billion.
   Cuomo last week proposed $406 million in program cuts and
cost-savings from the $44.2 billion-plus budget the Legislature
adopted less than two months ago. He also wants to make use of a
$650 million fund that, ironically, was created with the 1986 tax
windfall and set aside for low-income housing and highway projects.
   Cuomo has, among other things, ordered a hiring freeze for state
agencies and proposed increasing tuition for out-of-state students
at New York's public colleges. He's called for the elimination of
the State Police's six-horse mounted patrol, a favorite at fairs
throughout New York.
   Cuomo has refused to call for tax increases or even a delay of
tax cuts enacted last year, even though at the time he suggested
the cuts might be too generous.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claim Victories as 10th Rainy Season Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas fighting in
Cambodia said in a broadcast available Sunday that they killed or
wounded nearly 3,000 Vietnamese soldiers during May.
   The claim contradicted earlier pronouncements by Hanoi, which
said fighting had died down and it could therefore begin
withdrawing troops.
   The clandestine Khmer Rouge radio said 2,821 Vietnamese soldiers
had been killed or wounded during the first month of the 10th rainy
season of the war. It said Hanoi's administrative networks had been
dismantled in 537 villages, 11 communes and one township.
   Past rainy seasons have usually favored the guerrillas, who are
fighting the mechanized, conventional forces Vietnam has maintained
in Cambodia since its late 1978 invasion.
   ``They lack both fighting forces and food supplies, and their
aggressor soldiers are increasingly demoralized,'' said the
broadcast, made available in Bangkok. ``In sum, the Vietnamese have
failed and are a complete impasse.''
   Vietnam, however, has announced that a greatly improved security
situation in Cambodia would allow it to pull 50,000 troops out of
Cambodia over the next seven months. The partial withdrawal may
begin late this month.
   Western analysts, who are generally skeptical of Khmer Rouge
claims, say there has been a sharp drop in fighting in Cambodia in
recent months. They speculated that the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrilla groups may be stockpiling weapons and positioning
themselves for a big push when Hanoi's forces are scaled down.
   The Khmer Rouge, ousted from power by the Vietnamese, are allied
to two non-communist groups in a loose coalition.

   Mississippi state troopers and social
workers Saturday were still seeking dozens of youngsters who fled a
Baptist boarding school moments before authorities investigating
allegations of abuse could take them into state custody.
   Sixty-four residents of the Bethel Home for Children in
Lucedale, about 100 miles to the southeast, were taken to the
Mississippi State Hospital here. Most arrived Friday night, while
others arrived at the psychiatric hospital Saturday.
   Some of the children, ages 8 through 17, were found in private
homes, restaurants and along the streets of Lucedale.
   Most of the 120 to 160 students at the school had fled Friday
before state social workers arrived to carry out a court order
assigning the state temporary custody of the children.
   The whereabouts of the remaining children was not known
Saturday, and state welfare officials said they might be in hiding.
   The home's operator, The Rev. Herman Fountain, said Saturday he
is sheltering four or five youngsters who fled. He also said in a
telephone interview from Lucedale that he had taken a new teen-age
boy into the Bethel Home on Saturday and would continue to take any
children dropped off by parents, the Biloxi Sun-Herald reported in
its Sunday editions.
   ``I've still got a few soldiers left, and I'm trying to work
back to what it was before,'' Fountain said.
   The judge who issued the order said there was reason to suspect
physical and mental abuse of students. Complaints by former
residents of the home ranged from severe beatings to forced labor.
   Some children received excessive corporal punishment and no
medical care and were harassed by other children at the home, state
Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said Saturday.
   As to any new residents taken in by Fountain, Brittain said the
state would await orders from the judge, Robert Oswald of
Pascagoula.
   Oswald said he wouldn't indicate how he'll deal with the
development until Monday, when a court hearing is scheduled in the
case.
   Fountain, 38, said in the interview that he became a minister
after God saved him from heroin addiction in New York City in 1972
and that he opened the Bethel Home for children in 1979.
   He denied telling the children to run away from the home when
welfare officials arrived.
   ``The children are in here mainly for runaways, stealing,
homosexuality. We have little girls who are whores,'' Fountain
said, adding that strict discipline is required for such youths.
   ``The parents have lost control. Kids today are such
manipulators. Such cons. Especially a child from a divorce. They've
learned how to manipulate their parents,'' he said.
   By Saturday evening, Brittain said he had released 10 children
to their parents. He said he expected to keep interviewing parents
Saturday and Sunday; by Monday, he said he hoped to arrange the
return of almost all the children.
   Eric Parker, 16, was among the students who screamed angrily at
Welfare Department workers and state troopers when they arrived
Friday.
   ``You have no right,'' he yelled. ``I want to be here with my
people. I don't want to be with all the rest of you people who hate
the truth. You better check yourself and make sure you are not
burning on the way to hell.''
   The home is on the grounds of Bethel Baptist Church, which is
not affiliated with any formal group.
   Authorities are not sure how many students were at the home
because they have not seen its records and were not been able to
contact Fountain since Friday, Brittain said.
   The missing children might have been moved secretly to another
location by Fountain, he said.
   ``We have a suspicion in that direction, but don't like to make
a confirmation one way or another until we are sure,'' Brittain
said.
   Brittain said he had met with parents or more than a dozen
children but did not return children to some who refused to answer
questions.
   ``We indicated to them that until they did, they had better make
some other arrangements for their children,'' Brittain said.
   State officials said they hoped that the children would be
released to their parents or guardians as soon as possible.
Officials telephoned parents and guardians and set up a special
line for them.
   Hospital officials reported handling calls from parents as far
away as Oregon and New Hampshire.
   ``We started getting calls just after lunch (Friday),'' said
spokeswoman Wynona Winfield. ``Yes, you can say it's been busy.
Busy, busy.''
   Oswald ruled Friday afternoon that he was turning over custody
of the residents to the state. The independent Baptist boarding
school has come under fire several times since 1980.
   A physician testified during a hearing into the welfare of one
child who ran away from the home that during a 19-month stay at
Bethel the child did not receive medical treatment for an eye
condition that could have left him blind.
   Doctors at the state hospital helped conduct medical
examinations of the children but would not comment on their
condition, Winfield said.
   A court hearing is set for Monday in the case.
   The state hospital was chosen to house the children because of
readily available living space, food services, recreational
facilities and medical and crisis intervention services, Brittain
said.
   The children will have no contact with patients, officials said.
Boys slept Friday night on mattresses in the gymnasium, while the
girls stayed in a vacant dormitory.
   Minutes after Oswald issued his order at 11 a.m. Friday, state
Welfare Department personnel arrived at the home. The youths
apparently were alerted about the court order and most had fled.
   ``I didn't tell those kids to run,'' Fountain said Friday.
   Fountain had been jailed for two days for refusing to give
officials a list of residents. He was released Friday without
providing the information when he agreed to an orderly transfer of
the children to state custody.
   Brittain said he didn't know what action, if any, would be taken
against Fountain.

   Opponents of a law that made Islam the
state religion closed stores and halted traffic in the capital
Sunday as they began an eight-hour nationwide strike.
   However, the monsoon rain kept police and protesters out of the
streets of Dhaka.
   The country's mainstream opposition called the strike to condemn
the law passed Tuesday by the 300-seat Parliament and signed into
law by President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   Foes of the law had led torchlight parades through Dhaka on
Saturday.
   The government tightened security in the capital and other
cities in preparation for the strike Sunday. Riot police in trucks
followed several small protest parades Saturday evening, but did
not interfere.
   Among those who called the eight-hour general strike are three
major opposition political alliances.
   At least 30 people have been injured and 35 vehicles damaged in
repeated clashes with police since Parliament approved the bill.
   ``We have several thousand police on constant duty in Dhaka and
elsewhere. We are going to deploy more for tomorrow,'' a Home
Ministry source told The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Ershad attacked those organizing the strike.
   ``They have called this hartal (strike) against Allah, his
prophet and his religion,'' Ershad told Moslems at a Dhaka mosque
after Friday prayers.
   He denied charges that the bill was aimed at perpetuating his
rule, which began with a bloodless coup by the former army general
in 1982.
   ``None can rule unless Allah wishes it,'' Ershad said.
   The measure amends the nation's constitution by inserting the
sentence: ``The religion of the republic is Islam, but other
religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.''
   Opponents of the bill, mostly opposition politicians, women,
students and members of the minority Christian, Hindu and Buddhist
religions, say they fear it will lead to imposition of harsh
Islamic rule based on the Koran.
   More than 85 percent of the country's 105 million people are
Moslems. But the government denies it plans to change the nation's
British-based civil law.

   Hundreds of U.S. and Mexican firefighters
on Sunday battled fires that burned thousands of acres of brush and
timber on both sides of the border and raced across an Apache
Indian reservation, officials said.
   A forest fire that started in Mexico charred 6,000 acres, about
3,500 on the U.S. side of the border near Nicksville, and damaged
two structures in a park picnic area, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Jim Payne in Phoenix.
   The blaze, which Payne called ``a raging monster out of
control,'' also had threatened ranch homes in the Coronado National
Monument, about 50 miles south of Tucson, before they were saved by
crews who started backfires.
   Nearly 200 miles north, a second fire that was sparked by
lightning Friday in logging slash on a reservation near Cibecue had
covered more than 500 acres of timber and brush by early Sunday,
Payne said.
   South of the border, the largest fire _ more than 10,000 acres _
had been burning for more than a week in the Sierra Pinta Mountains
of Mexico's Sonora state, Payne said. Four U.S. forest officials
crossed the border to serve as advisers in fighting the blaze.
   The fire near Nicksville was burning mostly on state and federal
land in the national monument and the Coronado National Forest at
elevations above 7,000 feet, he said. Authorities were unsure what
started the blaze.
   The blaze damaged a restroom and a ramada, the Western version
of a gazebo, in a picnic area within the national monument area,
Payne said.
   About 300 firefighters battled the blaze on the U.S. side
Saturday, said Coronado National Forest spokesman Dennis
Brandolino, but another 500 to 700 firefighters were expected
Sunday from New Mexico, Idaho and nearby states. Mexican
firefighters were battling the flames on their side of the border.
   Three planes made a dozen runs to drop about 30,000 gallons of
fire retardant on the border blaze, said Joe Perea, the fire's
air-service coordinator from Moutainair, N.M.
   Intermittent high winds whipped the Cibecue fire, where about
280 firefighters were on the line Saturday night, said
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest spokesman Ken Palmrose.
   The blaze at the 6,000-foot level was burning ``heavy pine, fir
and some (scrub) oak in the canyon bottoms,'' eating away at
chaparral and other types of brush on the ridges, Palmrose said.
   The fire was being managed by an ``interagency overhead team''
with representatives from the federal Forest and Park services and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with consultation from the White
River Apache Tribe, Palmrose said.

   A high Iranian official denied reports
that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was terminally ill, Iran's
official news agency said Sunday.
   Iran's Interior Minister Ali-Akbar Mohtashemi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying he met the national leader
last week. He said the revolutionary patriarch ``is now in perfect
shape'' in the broadcast monitored in Nicosia.
   Khomeini, 87, has been reported to be in frail health since he
suffered a heart attack two years ago. There have also been
unconfirmed reports that he has cancer.
   Mohtashemi called the latest report ``a Zionist scheme to cheer
up Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his demoralized army.'' Iran
and Iraq have been waging war for nearly eight years.
   The U.S. CBS television network reported Thursday that
intelligence reports indicated that Khomeini ``may now be very
close to death.''

   Police fired tear gas to drive back
students who tried to storm the government party's headquarters
Sunday during the funeral of a radical who committed ritual suicide.
   Hundreds of riot police firing volleys of tear gas pushed back
waves of charging students who sought to reach the offices of the
Democratic Justice Party. The screaming students hurled hundreds of
firebombs, and streets were covered with blazing gasoline as
running clashes flared across the center of the city.
   ``Down with the military fascists,'' radical students yelled,
and they hurled rocks and firebombs at police in Seoul's main
shopping district. Protesters destroyed a police truck with
firebombs.
   But riot police quickly pushed protesters back and chased them
through the city for several miles. Radicals hurled rocks at the
Japanese Embassy's information office and smashed windows.
   The fighting broke out during a funeral procession by about
10,000 radical students and sympathizers for Park Rae-chun, who
died Monday after setting fire to himself in an anti-government
protest. It was the third ritual suicide by a radical student since
May 15.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent radical student
protests during the past month. Thousands of students trying to
reach North Korea for talks on reuniting the divided Korean
peninsula battled riot police in major street clashes Friday.
   Some marchers shouted ``Yankee go home'' Sunday, but the protest
was less anti-American than others in recent days. Instead, it was
directed mainly at the government of President Roh Tae-woo.

   Prolific writer Louis L'Amour, whose popular
novels recreated the Old West of gunfighters and lawmen, cattle
rustlers and horse thieves, has died of lung cancer, relatives
said. He was 80.
   L'Amour died Friday night in his Los Angeles home, said his
wife, Kathy.
   President Reagan praised L'Amour in 1983 for ``having brought
the West to the people of the East and to people everywhere.''
   The author penned 101 books, nearly all of them Westerns,
including ``Hondo,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' ``The Iron
Marshal,'' ``The Quick and the Dead,'' ``Sackett's Land,'' ``Down
the Long Hills,'' and ``Ride the Dark Trail.''
   Several, including ``How the West Was Won,'' were made into
motion pictures, Mrs. L'Amour said.
   Reagan presented L'Amour in 1984 with the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. The previous year, L'Amour received a National Gold Medal,
awarded by Congress.
   Born in Jamestown, N.D., in 1908, L'Amour quit school and left
home when he was 15, working as a prize fighter, tugboat deckhand,

   A DC-9 jetliner carrying at least
21 people crashed Sunday while trying to land at a fogbound airport
in northeastern Argentina, authorities said. There were no
immediate reports of survivors.
   According to the government news agency Telam, at least 15
passengers and a crew of six were on board the Austral airlines
jet, which left Buenos Aires' airport at 7 a.m. and stopped at the
northern river port of Resistencia.
   Local news and radio reports said the plane then headed north
and crashed at 9:50 a.m. into a plantation three miles short of the
Posadas airport while trying to land there in heavy fog.
   Posadas, the capital of Misiones Province, is 700 miles
northeast of Buenos Aires and across the Parana River from the
Paraguayan city of Encarnacion.
   There were unconfirmed reports the jetliner was on fire moments
before it crashed. Firefighters who rushed to the scene in the
semi-tropical north of Argentina said it appeared unlikely there
were any survivors, Telam said.
   Austral is a private carrier purchased last year from the state
that competes with the government carrier Aerolineas Argentinas on
domestic routes across Argentina, the world's eighth-largest
country geographically.

<HEAD>Summit Impact on Nicaragua: Zero</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent Soviet-American summit, widely seen
as dealing a telling blow to the Cold War, appears to have had no
impact on the continuing struggle between the two countries over
Nicaragua.
   Just a week after President Reagan bade a warm farewell to
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow, peace talks in Nicaragua
broke down and once again there is talk of renewing U.S. military
aid to the Contra rebels.
   Although the administration has made no decisions, officials
seem to be laying the groundwork for a new aid request now that the
negotiations between the Soviet-backed Sandinistas and the Contras
have collapsed, at least for the time being.
   The experience at the summit suggests Washington and Moscow are
able to move ahead on such issues as arms control, human rights and
bilateral issues, but mutual suspicions continue to run high in the
so-called ``low intensity conflicts'' in the Third World. Such
conflicts continue in Central America, southern Africa, the Middle
East, the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams acknowledged in an
interview Friday that whatever progress Reagan and Gorbachev have
made on other issues during their summit meetings, U.S. concerns
about Kremlin policy in Nicaragua remain unchanged.
   ``The Soviet Union has not shown any restraint in shipment of
arms to Sandinistas,'' Abrams said. Estimates of Soviet military
deliveries to the Nicaraguan government range between $250 million
and $500 million since five Central American presidents signed a
regional peace plan 10 months ago, he said.
   Abrams rejected out of hand a Soviet proposal to end military
deliveries to the Sandinistas provided the United States terminates
such shipments to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
   He said this would make Moscow and Washington coequal in an area
of vital interest to the United States and of no historic interest
to the Kremlin
   If the United States ceases aiding its allies in Central
America, ``how are they to resist Cuban subversion?'' he asked.
   The Kremlin view is that the United States, by aiding the
Nicaraguan rebels starting just months after Reagan took office in
1981, bears the major responsibility for the death and destruction
in Nicaragua since then.
   Abrams had had little to say on Nicaragua after Congress
rejected on Feb. 3 Reagan's last request for military aid for the
Contras. But after the peace talks broke down last Thursday, he
sounded like his old combative self again, accusing the Sandinistas
of engaging in bad faith.
   ``It's important to be clear on what happened,'' Abrams said.
The rebels wanted the Sandinistas to turn ``vague promises'' of
democracy for Nicaragua into a firm timetable. But the only firm
timetable the Sandinistas wanted to discuss was the one in which
the rebels would be required to turn in their arms as part of a
final settlement, he said.
   ``When the time came for the Sandinistas to make serious
commitments, it was over,'' he said.
   That view was not shared by Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega, head of the Sandinista delegation, who said Thursday the
Contras held ``irrational positions'' and maintained an
``anti-negotiation attitude against the peace.''
   As for the prospect for a new Contra aid request, the
administration is expected to discuss that issue this coming week.
On Capitol Hill, the main protagonists on past Contra aid votes
already are staking out positions along familiar lines.
   ``I encourage the White House to move now ... and send up an aid
package for a vote before the July recess,'' said Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y.
   Said Rep. David Bonior, R-Mich., ``This is no time to be talking
of military aid.''

<HEAD>A Massive Call-in Campaign Ties Up a Congressman's Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a month, the telephones in the office of
Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., have been tied up by members of an
anti-pornography group who have been urged to phone him and keep
calling ``till you get through.''
   Constituents have been unable to reach Hughes, the House
speaker's staff has had to send a page to contact him and even an
exasperated Hughes has been kept from reaching his secretary when
he's away from the office.
   About 10,000 calls and nearly 20,000 letters have arrived in a
campaign orchestrated by the American Family Association, of
Tupelo, Miss., which told its members that an anti-pornography bill
would die in a subcommittee chaired by Hughes.
   ``Perhaps you believe that a congressional office looks like
Home Shopping Network, with dozens of operators sitting before
computer terminals, ready and able to take messages,'' the
congressman wrote the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, the group's executive
director, on May 23, complaining about the tactic, and calling it
needless.
   Hughes, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime,
said the bill is very much alive, and will have a second hearing on
Thursday. Any delays have been caused by the diversion of staffers
from the bill to work on the letters and phone calls, he said.
   Callers to Hughes' office are now greeted by a recorded message
from the seven-term congressman that is on two answering machines.
The machines were paid for by members of Hughes' staff, who decided
the crisis could not wait for House officials to buy the devices.
   After advising callers on other matters to dial another number,
Hughes tells those interested in the pornography bill:
   ``You can be certain that I and the other 200 sponsors of this
important measure will do all we can to see that it becomes law in
a timely fashion.
   ``Thank you for calling. There's no need to leave a message.
Your call is being counted automatically.''
   Hughes said in the interview, and in letters to House colleagues
and Wildmon, that the family association fed its members inaccurate
information, including an allegation that pornographers are
twisting arms of lawmakers to kill the bill.
   But the most inaccurate message, Hughes said, is that the Child
Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 is dying in the
House Judiciary subcommittee on crime.
   ``We're in the hearing process,'' Hughes said. ``Wildmon
demanded we abandon that process and pass the bill with no
amendments.''
   Hughes said that some provisions in the bill raise ``sensitive
First Amendment concerns.''
   Noting the 11-year-old association's letter asks for donations,
Hughes said the money appeal may be the real message the group
wants to convey.
   The legislation encompasses a number of recommendations from the
Reagan administration's Commission on Pornography.
   Some of its provisions would allow government seizure of money
and property derived from violation of pornography and obscenity
laws; use of wiretaps in obscenity investigations; prohibition of
obscenity in cable television programming; and creation of a new
crime of receiving or possessing obscenity with the intent to
transfer.
   Wildmon told his followers in early May that the legislation
``is about to die'' in Hughes' committee, and urged supporters,
``If his phone is busy, keep calling till you get through.''
   The letter said pornographers are ``spending a lot of money,
twisting a lot of arms and pressuring a lot of congressmen,'' and
asked, ``If you can help defray these unexpected costs, I'd be
grateful. You can use the enclosed envelope.''
   Wildmon said in an interview that he regrets the inconvenience
suffered by Hughes' staff, but contended he only wrote the letter
after the crime subcommittee staff refused to tell him about plans
for the bill.
   Hughes replied that he doubted that allegation, since the staff
fields such routine inquiries all the time.
   Asked what evidence he had that the bill would die in committee,
Wildmon said, ``I was told by a number of people who knew what they
were talking about.'' Asked who they were he replied, ``No
comment.'' He also declined to say how he knew pornographers were
pressuring lawmakers.
   Wildmon denied that the purpose of his letter was to raise
money, commenting, ``It cost me $79,000 to send the letter. To
date, we raised $42,000. If I'm going to raise funds by losing
$37,000 I'm going to be out of business in a hurry.
   ``It was a two-page letter and there were three sentences of an
apology, saying I've got expenses to meet.''
   Wildmon said the group had 330,000 supporters, a number based on
the 170,000 ministers and 160,000 others who receive the group's
publications. The American Family Association, Wildmon said, is a
group that ``promotes things that would enhance the family'' and
has taken positions against pornography, abortion, and some
broadcast entertainment shows.

<HEAD>Gromyko: Roman Catholic Church Free To Expand in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Andrei A. Gromyko said in remarks
published Sunday that the government will not stand in the way of
the expansion of the Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet Union.
   ``Of course we aren't making any attempts to encroach on the
rights of the Catholic church,'' Gromyko was quoted as saying in
the Communist Party newspaper Pravda. ``And likewise, we are not
trying to encroach on the rights of Catholics living in the Soviet
Union.''
   Gromyko make the comments Saturday during the celebration of
Christianity's arrival 1,000 years ago in what is now the Soviet
Union. The communist Soviet government is officially atheist.
   Gromyko's comments followed a question by Cardinal Johannes
Willebrands on the possibility of organizing Catholic churches not
only in the Soviet Union's Baltic republics, where a recognized
church exists in Lithuania, but also in other parts of the Soviet
Union where there are large Catholic communities.
   Willebrands, who heads the Vatican's secretariat for Christian
Unity, is a member of the largest Vatican delegation ever to visit
the Soviet Union. He was among several foreign dignitaries in
Moscow for the church millennium who were invited to a Kremlin
meeting with Gromyko.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said large Catholic
communities exist in the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan. Those
republics have no fully recognized Catholic churches, and the
Vatican wants the right to appoint bishops there, Navarro said.
   Pravda's report of Willebrands' question, taken from a Tass
dispatch, omitted the cardinal's specific references to the
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan, reflecting the Kremlin's
sensitivity on the issue.
   Gromyko said Catholic churches could be opened outside the
Baltic states if local authorities agree.
   ``In the future, we will give the necessary attention to the
wishes of Soviet Catholics regardless of where they live,'' the
78-year-old president was quoted as saying.
   Willebrands met Friday with clergy of the underground Ukrainian
Catholic Church, which Josef V. Stalin ordered absorbed into the
Russian Orthodox Church in 1946.
   Ukrainian clerics say there are 3 million to 4 million Ukrainian
Catholics in the Soviet Union. Pope John Paul II said in a letter
in April to Ukrainian Catholics that their church should be fully
recognized.
   The state-supported Russian Orthodox Church bitterly opposes
recognition of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, claiming it was
formed only as a result of a forced split in the Orthodox Church at
the end of the 16th century.
   The issue was discussed June 7-9 at an unofficial seminar on
religious problems in the Soviet Union. Over the weekend, religious
activists released a resolution they adopted at the meeting that
called for the Russian Orthodox Church to legalize the Ukrainian
church and other underground churches.
   The leader of the Vatican delegation in Moscow, Cardinal
Agostino Casaroli, met Sunday with Konstantin Kharchev, head of the
government's Council for Religious Affairs. Navarro said they
discussed ``different questions regarding the relations between the
Catholic church and Soviet government,'' but he would not give
details of the talk.

   Mozambican rebels shot and killed a

newspaper said Sunday.
   The attack was the second cross-border raid by Mozambique
National Resistance geurrillas into Zimbabwe's Mount Darwin area in
four weeks, said the Sunday Mail, which is published in Harare by
the state-owned Mass Media Trust.
   It said the incident happened several days ago and was confirmed
by Harare police Saturday. Police identified the dead as Mativenga
Nyarugwe and her 4-year-old son, Karorado.
   The right-wing Mozambique National Resistance, also known by its
Portuguese acronym RENAMO, has been fighting since 1977 to topple
Mozambique's Marxist government. RENAMO rebels have have mounted
numerous raids into Zimbabwe during the past year, mainly to steal
food and supplies.

   Waves of students yelling
``Revolution!'' and hurling firebombs tried to storm the
headquarters of the governing party Sunday during a funeral march
for a radical who committed ritual suicide.
   Thousands of riot police firing volleys of tear gas fought off
attacking students and pursued them in running clashes through the
center of Seoul. Protesters showered police with exploding
firebombs that covered streets with blazing gasoline.
   Hundreds of people out for walks choked and cried with pain when
they were caught in clouds of stinging tear gas.
   ``Down with the military fascists!'' and ``Revolution of the
masses!'' the radicals screamed as they broke up sidewalk paving
stones to hurl at police.
   The violence began when 10,000 students and sympathizers marched
through the city with the coffin of Park Rae-chun, who died June 6
after setting himself on fire. It was the third protest suicide by
radical students since May 15.
   Marchers armed with firebombs, rocks and clubs tried to attack
the headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party during
the march but were blocked by riot police in combat fatigues and
black helmets.
   Protesters set fire to a police truck with firebombs and damaged
the information office of the Japanese Embassy with rocks. A number
of police and students were hurt and some protesters were arrested,
but no figures were available.
   Police reported the first death from the unrest. A riot trooper
died Sunday after being injured in fighting the day before in the
central city of Taejon.
   The wave of student protests is the nation's worst political
violence since anti-government riots in June 1987.
   But unlike last summer, where pro-democracy demonstrators
enjoyed wide support from the masses, the radical students
demonstrating now represent a small minority. Most South Koreans do
not support their demands for reunification of communist North
Korea with the pro-Western South and the withdrawal from the South
of 42,000 U.S. troops.
   Marchers shouted ``Yankee go home!'' on Sunday, but the protest
was less anti-American than other recent demonstrations. Marchers
yelled slogans as they passed the U.S. Information Service
building, but there were no incidents beyond one man hurling a
soft-drink can.
   Students wore red headbands with anti-government slogans and
beat drums and gongs as they marched through the city. The coffin,
covered in yellow flowers, was carried by bearers in traditional
white mourning clothes.
   The dead student belonged to a faction seeking creation of a
revolutionary government.
   Marchers began arming themselves with firebombs from a truck
loaded with the weapons as the procession continued after a rally
in front of City Hall. Students wielding clubs, rocks and firebombs
went to Democratic Justice Party headquarters where riot police
blocked the street.
   They attacked police, who fired volleys of tear gas. Armored
vans with multiple tear gas launchers blasted protesters. Hundreds
of riot police waiting in sidestreets poured out and quickly routed
the attackers.
   Students at one point seized a highway overpass, but special
police martial arts squads hurling tear gas grenades attacked and
dispersed them.
   The protest was aimed mainly at the government of President Roh
Tae-woo. Radical leaders denounced the government as a dictatorship
and called for creation of a peoples' republic.
   ``We are here to fight for liberation of the masses,'' said one
leader.
   The radical students have rejected democratic reforms made by
the Roh government in recent months, insisting the government is a
front for dictatorial military rule.
   They say the presence of the American troops, stationed here
under a mutual defense pact, encourages military rule.
   Some people watching the march expressed bewilderment and anger.
   An elderly man, who yelled that students were not patriots,
tried to attack marchers.
   ``Why do these young people do this? What does it say about our
country,'' one middle-aged man said.

   A farmer lying in wait for a gang of
robbers hurled a spear from his hideout and accidentally killed one
of his two wives, police said Sunday.
   Joseph Sikuku heard noises from where he hid outside his village
of Indangalaisa on Friday night, thought it was a gang that had
robbed his neighbors and tossed the spear, police said.
   His wife, Paustsina Nambutie, was hidden in some bushes nearby
and was fatally wounded.
   Police said they were hunting the eight-man gang that had robbed
four families in the village early that evening.
   Sikuku, fearing he might become a victim of the gang, woke his
two wives and their children and told them to hide in a nearby
cornfield, police said.
   He took cover armed with a spear. He realized he had killed his
wife when he left his hideout to inspect the body of his victim,
police said.

   Passengers using unauthorized electric heaters
caused a fire that swept through a Soviet cruise ship and killed 11
people, a Soviet investigation has concluded.
   The official Tass news agency said a Soviet Ministry of Merchant
Marine commission had traced the source of last month's fire in
Japan's Osaka Bay.
   ``The fire was due to passengers in cabin 346 using household
electric heaters contrary to regulations,'' Tass quoted commission
chairman Oleg Savin as saying.
   In its dispatch Friday, Tass did not say whether the passengers
who set up the heaters aboard the 4,870-ton Priamurye were among
the dead or whether legal action was being considered. But it said
a prosecutor's office was conducting its own probe, indicating
legal action is likely.
   Japanese investigators said shortly after the May 17-18 fire
that it may have been caused by a cigarette in a passenger cabin.

<TEXT>
   ``When I become president there are no more
impossible dreams.''
   It was a refrain Jesse Jackson repeated often in his travels
across the nation. He often seemed to marvel at how the
illegitimate son of a poor black teen-ager had ended up the
political toast of adoring crowds from Beverly Hills to West
Memphis, Ark., protected by a pack of Secret Service agents and
trailed by a busload of cameras and reporters.
   Even if he didn't become president, Jackson said his
presidential campaign showed how far blacks had come since the days
when they were relegated to the back of the bus.
   Nobody really knew how Jackson would be received in his second
Democratic presidential bid, and he angrily objected to the ``but
he can't win'' tag that often followed his name in news reports.
When the curtain fell on the primary season last Tuesday, he had
collected nearly 7 million votes, some 29 percent of the total.
   That was more than double his 1984 total and a second place
finish out of an original field of seven Democrats.
   He won the vote in Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Virginia,
District of Columbia, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, South
Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Some states where he won more than 20 percent of the vote had
black populations of less than 1 percent, thus accomplishing one of
Jackson's key goals this year _ adding white votes to his core
constituency of blacks.
   Jackson delights in belittling the skeptics and pundits who
speculated he couldn't do that.
   On the campaign trail, he often told the story of a white
supporter who came up to him in Beaumont, Texas. The man recalled
he had seen Jackson 20 years earlier at a civil rights
demonstration. He was on the other side, wearing the robes of the
Ku Klux Klan.
   The man said he was voting for Jackson in 1988.
   There were other such dramatic stories along the campaign trail
as Jackson crisscrossed the country courting blue collar workers,
farmers, women, gays, Hispanics and other minority groups with his
message of ``economic common ground.''
   Today, Jackson claims the legacy of his campaign is in the
creation of a coalition forged against ``ancient barriers'' of
race, religion, sex. He says he will make it a permanent political
force beyond the election.
   Officially, he launched his 1988 campaign last October. In
reality, he had never really stopped campaigning after 1984,
continuing to travel the country dazzling audiences with his
oratorical skills.
   His campaign kickoff in a rural Iowa hamlet was part of his
concerted 1988 effort to attract hard pressed farmers along with
others who had suffered in the Reagan years.
   The other centerpiece of his campaign was a promise to put a
stop to drugs and guns in the streets of America.
   The drug issue quickly became one of the most consistent crowd
pleasers in Jackson's stump speech. Soon others in the race were
also hitting the drug theme.
   Jackson's speeches were often as motivational as political in
orientation.
   ``I want something government can't give you,'' he told a rally
last week. ``I want you to feel better about yourself, lift your
spirits.
   ``Just because it rains you don't have to drown,'' was a vintage
Jackson line.
   Jackson's trademark was crowds numbering in the thousands.
   His penchant for wading into the throng to shake hands and pick
up babies contributed to another trademark, a schedule that
invariably ran hours behind schedule.
   It was a non-traditional candidacy _ that of a black Baptist
minister who had never held any governmental post. His views were
on the far left of his party in a year when Democrats were moving
toward centrist positions.
   But Jackson made it a point from the beginning to stake out a
more conciliatory posture than his rebel stance of 1984, when he
alienated many Democrats by attacks on his own party.
   He brought in advisers with longtime party credentials, and in
contrast to 1984 spent time meeting with congressional and state
level Democratic leaders.
   He made friends like the popular Texas agriculture commissioner,
Jim Hightower. He found some enemies, like the outspoken mayor of
New York City, Ed Koch, who made himself the voice of the
anti-Jackson Jewish vote.
   In the numerous debates held by the seven Democratic contenders,
Jackson invariably seized the chance to lend levity to the events.
   The others scrapped among themselves, generally leaving him out
of the fray. That gave Jackson the chance to appear the peacemaker,
bringing the focus back to attacking Republicans.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson has been good for the party,'' said Bert
Lance, the Georgia businessman who was in President Carter's inner
circle and became an adviser to Jackson.
   Other Democrats began to look on Jackson as more than a fringe
candidate when he swept several states in the 20-state Super
Tuesday primaries on March 8.
   After his respectable showings in other states, that set the
stage for his Michigan upset on March 26.
   But after the contest narrowed to just Jackson and Michael
Dukakis, he could no longer benefit from being the most famous
person in a pack of lesser knowns who were splitting the rest of
the vote.
   And some ghosts from 1984 refused to go away _ most notably the
antipathy toward him by Jewish voters who were offended that he had
called New York ``Hymietown'' and by his past association with
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his pro-Palestinian
positions.
   As the delegate margin slipped away from him, Jackson
increasingly sent a message that went beyond just the presidential
campaign.
   ``I will never surrender. Don't you surrender,'' he told his
audiences.
   Although the words came in the context of the presidential
campaign, Jackson clearly meant someting broader.
   ``What have I built? A coalition to change the course of our
nation for the better,'' he said. ``I've pushed back walls, I've
lifted ceilings.''

<HEAD>Student Gets Laugh During Encounter With Bill Cosby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>

   Lori Stoegbauer says the next time she meets
comedian Bill Cosby she'll know exactly what to say.
   ``Oh, my Bill,'' she said, repeating the line Cosby told her
after the two met at Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee last week.
   Stoegbauer, 22, a Marian College student, was returning from New
York on June 8 when a stewardess told her Cosby was on the airplane.
   Stoegbauer, a longtime Cosby fan, tracked down the comedian in
the airport and then screamed, ``Oh my God!''
   ``And then he just turned around and said, `God? I don't see God
anywhere. Who said that?''' Stoegbauer recalled. ``I said I did,
and he said, `Don't say, `Oh my God,' say, `Oh, my Bill.'''
   Stoegbauer said she recovered enough to shake Cosby's hand, take
his picture and tell him she had fourth-row seats for his show that
night at the Marcus Amphitheater in Milwaukee.
   That night at the show, Stoegbauer walked down an aisle right
below the stage. Because it was cool in the outdoor theater, she
was wearing two sweatshirts with the sleeves pulled down over her
hands. Her attire caught Cosby's attention again.
   ``He said, `Hey, you down there,''' Stoegbauer recalled. ``And I
said, `Who, me?' He said, `Yes, you. Come up here and show everyone
how you were just walking.'
   ``He was in the middle of this big stage, and he had two big
video screens on either side of him so everyone could see,'' she
added. ``I got up there and he imitated me and just stood there
laughing.''
   ``I asked him if he remembered me from the airport and he did,''
Stoegbauer said. ``I said, `Oh my God,' and he said, `No. Oh, my
Bill.' Then he said, `Thank you. You've been great.'''

<TEXT>
   The biblical fragrance of frankincense is on
the market again as Oman revives an ancient perfume industry that
flourished 3,000 years ago.
   The Oman Perfumery is opening new markets in the United States
and Europe for Amouage, Arabic for waves, a perfume based on
frankincense and myrrh.
   At about $375 an ounce, Amouage may be the world's most
expensive perfume.
   Frankincense, the gum from a desert shrub called boswellia
carterii, was prized in ancient times as a drug, a medicine and an
aromatic.
   Legend had it that frankincense trees were guarded by winged
serpents and that only an elite tribe could tap the bark for the
precious resin.
   Myrrh, the resin of a plant that looks like a small cactus
without the prickles, was once harvested in Dhofar province where,
legend has it, the three kings gathered before following the star
of Bethlehem to pay homage to Jesus.
   Amouage was developed in 1984 by the government-supported
perfumery, also known as the House of Amouage, and has been one of
Oman's major successes in its effort to diversify the country's
oil-based economy following the slump in oil prices.
   ``Amouage is the Rolls-Royce of perfumes,'' Khalifa al-Mukheini,
House of Amouage's marketing executive, told The Associated Press.
``It was created for people who don't have to ask the price.''
   It took four years for master perfumer Guy Robert, a Frenchman,
to develop the fragrance. He came up with three varieties that were
tested on men and women in the West and around the Middle East.
   A winning bouquet emerged, and the formula is a closely guarded
secret.
   What is known is that Amouage contains more than 100 natural
ingredients, including Dhofari frankincense and myrrh, Omani lime,
and Omani rose found on the 6,000-foot-high slopes of Green
Mountain.
   Added to these are exotic items including the honey-scented
tuberose, jasmine, blue chamomile, orris, vanilla, patchouli,
sandalwood, geranium and musk.
   The fragrance for men is decidedly musky. The women's is more
floral.
   Amouage has 50 major outlets in New York, London, Paris, Geneva
and the Persian Gulf, and despite its price, it appears to have a
growing clientele.
   It is sold in sterling silver flasks with 24-carat gold inlays.
But it also is sold in cellophane sachets at airport shops.
   The perfumery, on the outskirts of Muscat, Oman's capital,
declined to disclose dollar figures but said sales last year rose
by 16 percent over 1986.
   Officials anticipate another rise this year with a new marketing
drive into other parts of the United States, including Beverly
Hills.
   ``We'll soon be marketing a new brand of the exotic Arabian
perfume, to be sold in French-made crystal and at about 35 percent
the price of the Amouage in the silver flasks,'' al-Mukheini said.
   The government of Oman, a sultanate the size of Kansas on the
southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula, is giving guidance on
harvesting to frankincense growers and helping them find markets.
   There are no statistics on current frankincense production, but
there are an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 frankincense trees in
Dhofar.
   Three thousand years ago, the most sought after frankincense in
the world came from Dhofar, on the edge of the desolate Empty
Quarter.
   It was carried by camel train over the great caravan routes
across the Hadramut desert to Babylon, Egypt, Greece and Rome or
shipped in dhows to India and the Orient.
   About 3,000 tons are said to have been shipped annually during
the time of Christ.
   The Greek philospher Herodotus wrote that 2{ tons of
frankincense were burned every year in the Temple of Baal in
Babylon, now part of modern Iraq.
   A vertical incision is made in the bark of the tree, which can
range from 6 to 24 feet in height. The gum oozes from the tree and
hardens into translucent pearl-shaped drops.

<HEAD>Moderates Battling For Southern Baptist Comeback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Southern Baptists squared off Sunday
for another battle over control of the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, now firmly in the hands of the fundamentalist wing.
   As thousands of ``messengers'' gathered here for their annual
convention, some observers said the moderate camp might make a
comeback after nine years of defeat.
   ``It looks as if moderates could win in San Antonio,'' wrote
Daniel M. Allen, editor of the ``SBC Cause,'' urging the other side
to bring in voters to avert such an outcome.
   Convention business begins Tuesday after a day of preliminary
meetings and preaching. Up to 40,000 people are expected to attend
as representatives of the church's 14.7 million members.
   The conflict in the Southern Baptist Convention, as the
denomination is known, has intensified over the last year as
increased fundamentalist power drove various leaders out of office
and imposed tighter rules of belief.
   The struggle, fought largely over the issue of whether the Bible
is the literal truth, has stirred up bitter feelings and sharp
words.
   ``Clever men have stripped us of our rights,'' said John F.
Baugh, a Houston businessman and layman of the moderate camp.
Fundamentalism, he said, brings out an ``insatiable appetite for
power and demand for conformity.''
   ``It's time to stop this nonsense of barbarian attacks on that
which we hold dear.''
   A pro-fundamentalist former convention president, the Rev. James
T. Draper Jr. of Euless, Texas, said after a recent clash with a
moderate leader: ``It seems to be a situation of who can outmuscle
the other. They have given us no alternative.''
   A man in the middle, the Rev. Charles Fuller of Roanoke, Va.,
who for three years has headed a peace committee trying to calm the
turmoil, said the denomination is ``in a crisis of spirit.''
   The peace plan, he said, has been repeatedly violated and there
has been an ``acceleration of political activity'' by both sides
with partisan strategy meetings held in numerous states.
   At the center of the conflict is the denomination's powerful
presidency, which has the authority to appoint trustees who control
Southern Baptist agencies and institutions.
   Most of those boards now have fundamentalist majorities as a
result of the wing's nine years of presidential victories.
   The crucial decision at this week's meeting is election of a new
president. The two camps have rallied behind the expected opposing
nominees, and campaigns for them have rolled across the country.
   Backed by the fundamentalist wing is the Rev. Jerry Vines,
co-pastor of the 18,000-member First Baptist Church of
Jacksonville, Fla.
   The expected moderate nominee is the Rev. Richard Jackson of
Phoenix, Ariz., pastor of the North Phoenix Baptist Church, also
with 18,000 members.
   Both are fundamentalists in their views of the Bible, whose
interpretation has been at the crux of the struggle, but Jackson
doesn't favor imposing his view on institutional trustees, while
Vines does.
   ``I would not appoint anyone to any committee,'' Vines said,
``who did not endorse'' prescriptions laid down by the peace
committee.
   It insists the Bible is without error and on belief in its text
as literal truth _ that Adam and Eve were real people, that the
biblical miracles actually occurred, and that the Bible accurately
records history.
   Jackson said, ``I don't believe there ought to be a control
group,'' and that if he wins election, it would mean ``a change to
allow Baptists to be free again.''
   The winner will succeed the Rev. Adrian Rogers of Memphis,
Tenn., a fundamentalist standard-bearer who has held the post a
customary two years. His previous election in 1979 inaugurated the
fundamentalist tide.

<TEXT>
   The body of a young British spelunker
missing since August was found Sunday in a cave near Grenoble,
officials said.
   Alex Pritcher, 17, disappeared Aug. 7 after he became separated
from 20 other young cave explorers. All were from Manchester,
England.
   His companions reported him missing after he failed to appear at
a meeting point outside the cave.
   For more than a week, a team of 170 French rescue workers
searched inside and around the outside of the cave without finding
Pritcher.
   On Sunday, a team of first-aid workers training in cave rescues
discovered him at the bottom of a shaft near a network of chasms
known as the Shepherd's Pit, according to local police officials.
   The pit plunges to a depth of 3,765 feet. Authorities said
Pritcher probably died after being struck on the head and shoulders
by falling rocks.

<TEXT>
   Stephen Cox is off to see the Munchkins, the
wonderful Munchkins of Oz. But he has no Yellow Brick Road to
follow in his search for the little people who greeted Dorothy in
the 1939 film ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   ``It may not be easy to find some of them,'' said the writer.
``I know there are some still living, but they've sort of fallen
into the woodwork.''
   Cox is writing a book about the little people who sang and
danced with the young Judy Garland in the musical based on L. Frank
Baum's magical tale of good and bad witches, a bumbling wizard and
Dorothy's lovable friends, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion.
   Cox's book, ``Oz Remembered: Memoirs of the Munchkins,'' will be
published by E.P. Dutton of New York and released next year to
coincide with the 50th anniversary of the MGM movie classic.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are
fascinated by the Munchkins,'' said Jeanne Martinet, a Dutton
editor.
   So far, Cox has located about 30 of the 124 people who played
Munchkinland villagers and soldiers. He has spent days poring over
telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but
old address books and faded sign-in sheets from long-ago lunches on
the movie's set.
   ``I figure it's about time to give them some credit,'' Cox said,
adding that the movie credits gave them little mention. ``All it
said was `The Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.' Their scene lasts
about 10 minutes, but I think it's the most enchanting part of the
whole movie.''
   For Margaret Pellegrini, being a Munchkin meant a chance to meet
movie stars and other people of her size.
   She was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now, she
said recently from her home in Glendale, Ariz. ``Meeting up with
all the little people, because I hadn't been around very many
little people _ it was just a great experience.''
   ``I didn't think it would be so popular. Of course, I was
excited about it and I was thinking, `Oh boy, I'm going to
Hollywood.'''
   ``A lot of the Munchkins think: A book on the Munchkins? Is that
really going to sell?'' Cox said. ``They don't realize how popular
they are.''
   Most of the men and women who played the Munchkins were
recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by Leo Singer
and Major Doyle. But many of them had never acted before and some
were from Europe and didn't speak English, Cox said.
   A few of them went on in show business, but most eventually
settled into other jobs, he said.
   Mickey Carroll of St. Louis, now 69, continued acting for a
time, then returned home to the family business selling grave
monuments. Parnell St. Aubin opened a tavern in Chicago called the
Midget's Club and walked along the bar serving drinks. Meinhardt
Raabe went on to portray Little Oscar for Oscar Mayer lunchmeats
and made promotional appearances around the country.
   They're all proud of their parts in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' Cox
said. ``They're proud of being a part of one of the best motion
pictures ever made. A new generation discovers `The Wizard of Oz'
every year.''
   But for all the fond memories of working with Miss Garland and
the other stars, there were problems, Cox said.
   Pellegrini recalled heavy, elaborate costumes and layers of
makeup. Lewis Croft of Idaho Falls, Idaho, remembered how it
smarted when the plastic ``skin'' that made the men look bald was
ripped off like a piece of tape at the end of each day.
   Cox said he has heard a story about one Munchkin _ an actor
nicknamed ``The Count'' and well-known for his drinking _ who
visited the bathroom one day and wound up falling into the toilet
and being stuck there for 45 minutes.
   ``Some of the little people are telling tall tales,'' he said.
``But some of it's good for legends.''

<TEXT>
   Amid the cheers that greeted George Bush's speech
to a Republican gathering were sighs of relief from party activists
pleased that he finally took the offensive against Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   While the high command of the Bush presidential election
campaign pushed at the weekend conference for grass-roots work from
GOP regulars, party people from 16 states voiced new hope about the
vice president's prospects.
   Bush himself set last Thursday as an important turning point in
his campaign, using a speech in his adopted hometown of Houston to
lash out at the Dukakis record and the Massachusetts governor's
``out of the mainstream'' beliefs.
   Top Bush campaign aides said it always had been the plan that
Bush would turn his rhetorical guns on Dukakis _ but only at the
end of the primary and caucus season, when the identity of his fall
opponent was unmistakable.
   Bush said he thought Dukakis had ``pretty well shot his specific
bolts'' at him, and said, ``we're just beginning.''
   This proved heartening to Republicans who traveled to Denver for
the first of three unity conferences scheduled by the Republican
National Committee. Two more will be held in Cincinnati and Atlanta.
   ``I wanted to see Bush become his own man as soon as possible
because you've got to grab the initiative,'' said Bill Hughes, a
Bush campaign chairman from Vancouver, Wash. ``I was afraid that
Bush would wait until after the August convention to go and speak
out.''
   Hughes and other Republicans interviewed over the weekend agreed
that Bush still must overcome the obstacle of campaigning for
president while holding the office of vice president. And they said
he must be careful of moving too far away from President Reagan
because that could alienate people in his own party.
   ``I think it was critically important for him to start talking
about the facts about Michael Dukakis,'' said Barbara Campbell,
state GOP chairman in Montana. ``This was something I was really
pleased to see.''
   Several GOP figures said that Bush's early clinching of the
Republican Party nomination _ the late-April Pennsylvania primary
put him over the top _ had the effect of forcing the vice president
to the sidelines. They also said this caused Bush too often to be
on the defensive, to find himself questioned more on the Reagan
administration record than on his own plan for the nation's future.
   ``Our contest didn't last as long. We ended watching the Michael
Dukakis-Jesse Jackson show from the sidelines,'' said New Mexico's
Gov. Garrey Carruthers. ``I think that's cost him.''
   Carruthers said Bush would have to work especially hard in
western states where there was an absence of any genuine GOP
nomination competition late in the primary season.
   Punch Green, Bush's state campaign chairman in Oregon, said the
vice president's wide-ranging attacks on Dukakis' positions and his
record as governor will help ``make the contrast come out.''
   Not only that, he said, Bush seems far more comfortable making
speeches in which he couples explanations of his own positions with
criticisms of those held by Dukakis.
   ``I was just elated'' with Bush's speeches in Houston Thursday
and in Denver Friday, Green said. ``For the first time in a long
time, I heard a real campaign speech from my candidate.''
   Bush and his top campaign aides seemed buoyed by the
tub-thumping speeches of support given at this unity conference by
former GOP White House rivals Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and Alexander M.
Haig Jr.
   But the vice president's aides and the men who likely will be
Bush campaign surrogates also said the Republican ticket must work
hard to retain some of the Democratic and independent support that
Reagan enjoyed in 1980 and 1984.
   Richard Pinsky, who worked on Pat Robertson's campaign, said
that ``tens of thousands'' of Democrats crossed over to the GOP to
support Robertson.
   Pinsky said the party must work hard to keep these
``issue-driven'' voters in the Republican fold.
   Kemp, R-N.Y., said the Bush campaign must not write off any
region of the country or any group.
   And Bush pointedly reached out for Hispanic support, saying he
opposed a proposal to make English the official language and saying
he didn't feel people ought to be threatened by ``the growing
Hispanic-American population.''
   Francisco ``Joe'' Barrego of Denver, executive director of the
GOP's State Nationalities committee, said Bush is ``putting all his
affirmative actions out front.''
   ``I think he's doing the right thing right now,'' said Barrego,
whose organization speaks for people from Cuba, Czechoslovakia,
Latvia, Japan, Chinese and several other countries.

<HEAD>Palestinian Killed As Israelis Fight Fires Blamed on Arabs</HEAD>

   An Israeli bus driver shot and killed an
18-year-old Palestinian on Sunday after his passenger bus was
stoned, a hospital official said. Firefighters battled dozens of
blazes blamed on Arab arsonists.
   The army confirmed the stoning of the bus near the West Bank
town of Jericho and said an Arab man was reported dead. It said it
was investigating the circumstances of his death.
   In Hebron, stone-throwing protests broke out for a third day.
Near Tel Aviv, an Israeli man was seriously injured when he was hit
with a rock.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Mubarak Awad,
an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience, would likely be
deported by Monday after losing an appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.
   The court said Awad, who has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, did not
have a legal residence permit and was in Israel under an expired
visa in his American passport.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
Israeli civilian driver fired at assailants who stoned his
passenger bus as he drove past the Ein el-Sultan refugee camp near
Jericho.
   An official at Jericho Hospital said a camp resident, Saed
Mohammed El Hakak, died of wounds to the heart and back after he
was shot by the bus driver. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The death raised to 205 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
began Dec. 8. Two Israelis have died.
   Three more fires broke out Sunday, and Police Minister Chaim
Bar-Lev blamed Arab arsonists for brush and forest fires that have
destroyed at least 35,000 acres of trees and pastures since May.
   ``There is no doubt that it is part of the intefadeh (uprising)
and linked to what is happening in the territories and to Israeli
Arabs,'' Bar-Lev told Israel radio.
   The latest fires erupted in the Bar Giora Forest outside
Jerusalem, near an Israeli weather station outside Tel Aviv, and
near the Jerusalem suburb of Ramot. The radio said a Gaza teen-ager
was detained and confessed to setting the weather station fire.
   Bar-Lev said several Arab suspects have been detained, including
two Arab teen-agers who have confessed to setting some of the fires.
   A leaflet published by the underground leadership of the
uprising called on Arabs to ``destroy and burn all the enemies'
agricultural and industrial resources.''
   In Hebron, eight Palestinian teen-agers were treated for effects
of tear gas after a clash with soldiers at Al Hussein High School,
an official at the city's Alia Hospital said.
   The army confirmed there were riots at the high school but had
no further comment.
   Near Tel Aviv, 27-year-old Israeli Shimon Baranes was in a
cardiac intensive care unit at Assaf Harofe Hospital after being
hit by a rock on a road connecting the Tel Aviv suburbs of Nes
Ziona and Rishon Lezion, said police spokeswoman Orit Daka.
   Ms. Daka said police detained several Arab suspects. She
declined to elaborate. But Israeli radio said a 17-year-old
Palestinian confessed to the attack.
   The expulsion order against the Jerusalem-born Awad, 44, a U.S.
citizen, came despite repeated appeals against the move by U.S.
officials. Israeli officials claimed Awad encouraged violence in
the occupied territories.
   ``There is no reason why we shouldn't deport this man who is one
of the leaders of the intefadeh,'' said Shamir spokesman Yossi
Ahimeir. ``He (Awad) claims he is non-violent, but much violence
has resulted from his activities.''
   Awad's American-born wife, Nancy Nye, has denied Israeli charges
that her husband authored leaflets urging violence. But his ideas
for strikes and tax boycotts have been adopted by the uprising's
leaders.
   The government ordered Awad's deportation May 6. Awad appealed
to the Supreme Court, which upheld the government's decision June 5
but gave no specific date for his expulsion.

<TEXT>
   Leading newspapers Sunday carried a stern
government call for tighter discipline and more ideological
indoctrination among students following a week of political
agitation at Beijing University.
   ``Our college students should uphold the (Communist) party
leadership, uphold socialism,'' the official party newspaper, the
People's Daily, admonished in a front-page article.
   Beijing University authorities tore down dozens of posters
students had put up in the past week. The posters demanded
democracy, an end to government bureaucracy and corruption, and
better living conditions.
   Putting up anonymous posters is against university rules.
   The unrest was triggered by the slaying June 2 of Chai Qingfeng,
a 22-year-old physics student who died in an off-campus brawl.
   University officials allowed students to set up a small shrine
to Chai in a room used for staff meetings. Dozens of paper flower
wreaths lined the small space, but the messages were non-political,
expressing sorrow over Chai's death.
   Students said they were not sure when they would be allowed to
hold a memorial service for Chai.
   The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poor
living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects after
graduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals.
   Thousands of students last week protested Chai's death by taking
to the streets and calling for a pro-democracy march to central
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Police sealed off the square to keep
protesters away.
   The students said Chai was beaten to death by ``hooligans'' when
he was buying liquor at a store, and they put up posters angrily
demanding speedy punishment of the unemployed local youths who had
allegedly killed him.
   The demonstration was the largest since massive pro-democracy
rallies in December 1986 and January 1987.
   Hundreds of students also gathered on the campus of Beijing
University for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be
learned from the incident.
   The People's Daily said the State Education Commission met
Friday and ordered that ``those who have violated school
regulations should be dealt with quickly and severely,'' but it did
not say what steps would be taken.
   Without specifically mentioning the unrest at Beijing
University, the commission said that a few students ``cannot tell
right from wrong with regard to some political principles and even
openly spread reactionary views.''
   The newspaper called for increased ideological education and
better school administration to maintain order.
   ``Any words or actions that impair party leadership, discipline,
stability and unity also obstruct the reforms and are against the
basic interests of the people of the whole country,'' the newspaper
quoted the education commission as saying.
   The commission's message also was carried by the Xinhua News
Agency, and most national newspapers published the Xinhua report.
   With the school year almost at an end, the extent of any
discipline may not become clear until a new semester starts in
September.
   At the university, campus bulletin boards that until Saturday
were plastered with dozens of posters criticizing the government
were almost bare, with only a few notices for music recitals and
graduate school exam preparation. The few students reading the
notices said they thought the political unrest was over.
   The government made it clear last week that it would not permit
a repeat of the massive student pro-democracy marches of 1986-87.
That winter, thousands of students in Beijing and other major
cities took to the streets to demand Western-style political
reforms to match the country's economic reforms.
   Conservatives in the leadership ousted Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang for failing to halt the student protests quickly enough.
   This time, authorities moved decisively. Within 48 hours of
Chai's slaying, police tried to defuse tensions by arresting six
suspects.

   House Speaker Jim Wright denied Sunday that he
had violated House conflict-of-interest rules in his financial
dealings and declared ``I am extremely confident'' of being cleared.
   ``I'm haven't done anything dishonest or illegal,'' said the
Texas Democrat. ``I'm convinced I haven't violated any rules of the
House.''
   Wright's comments came during back-to-back appearances on
CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' and ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   They were part of his response to an announcement Friday by the
House ethics committee that it was beginning a preliminary inquiry
into the allegations. Wright held a two-hour news conference Friday
to deny the allegations and he repeated many of those statements on
Sunday.
   Wright called the charges ``a partisan political ploy'' raised
by Republicans seeking to deflect Democratic charges of ethical
violations by current and former members of the Reagan
administration.
   ``It's a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan
ploy,'' Wright said on the CBS program.
   The committee's inquiry was originally suggested by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., but the panel said its investigation would range
beyond the scope proposed by Gingrich.
   Next month, Wright will preside next month over the Democratic
National Convention and he said Sunday that he doesn't expect the
ethics investigation to have any effect on that role.
   Asked on the CBS show if he would give up that chairmanship,
Wright said, ``I don't expect to.''
   Asked if his running the convention would hurt the Democrats,
Wright answered, ``There is no cloud over my head, no sir. ... I've
done nothing unethical, nothing illegal, nothing violative of the
rules of the House.''
   Wright declined to say if he thought the investigation should be
handled by an independent counsel, rather than the ethics committee
in the Democratic-controlled House.
   ``I'm not trying to tell the committee how to conduct its
inquiry,'' Wright said.
   Asked if he wanted the investigation done by the committee or an
independent counsel, Wright answered, ``I don't have a preference.''
   But he continued, ``I want it resolved and I want it resolved as
quickly as possible'' and he pledged full cooperation.
   Wright defended his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' from
which he received a 55 percent royalty totaling about $55,000.
Questions have been raised about whether that royalty percentage is
higher than is normally paid.
   ``There was nothing wrong with the contract,'' Wright said,
later adding, ``I think it's a good book.''
   Asked about reports that his friends were buying the books as a
way to give financial support to Wright, he answered, ``I didn't
sell these books'' to friends.
   ``Royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity _ Mrs.
Wright and me,'' he said.
   The ethics committee is investigating whether Wright used one of
his staff members to work on the book at taxpayer expense, whether
the royalty amounts were excessive, and whether they were paid in
return for Wright giving some of his campaign business to William
Carlos Moore, the publisher.
   Moore served more than four months in federal prison after
pleading guilty in 1975 to income tax evasion charges. Wright had
written a letter to the federal court on Moore's behalf.
   ``It may have been poor judgment'' to write the letter, said
Wright, although he defended his long friendship with Moore and
said, ``I'm not ashamed of that.''
   ``Sure, I've made mistakes of judgment, but I haven't done
anything dishonest or illegal,'' Wright said.

<HEAD>Opposition Calls Strike, Protests Law Making Islam State Religion</HEAD>

   Police clashed Sunday with
demonstrators protesting a constitutional amendment that made Islam
the state religion. Authorities said 50 people suffered minor
injuries.
   The demonstrations coincided with a one-day strike called to
protest the new law, passed Tuesday by Parliament and signed into
law by President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.
   Police and witnesses said about 20 vehicles, most of them
state-owned buses, were damaged by the demonstrators and that two
bicycle rickshaws were set ablaze. They said 30 people were
arrested.
   Police said there was no major violence and that groups of
protesters were small because of heavy rains.
   Most of the injuries occurred when police with wooden sticks
charged demonstrators outside Dhaka University, near Dhaka College
and at a ferry terminal in nearby Sadarghat, witnesses said.
   The strike, which was called by 20 major opposition parties to
protest the legislation, closed down most shops and private
businesses. Government offices remained open, but attendance was
reported as poor.
   The strike disrupted transportation, including inter-city bus
service, and delayed flights from Dhaka's airport.
   The United News of India news agency said several trains were
stalled when protesters blocked tracks.
   Reports from other cities, including Chittagong in the south and
Sylhet in the north, indicated widespread compliance with the
strike, which ended at dusk.
   Rashed Khan Menon, leader of a five-party leftist opposition
alliance, said the adherence to the strike indicated that ``the
people have rejected the law making Islam the state religion.''
   The opposition parties claim the new law is illegal because it
was passed by a Parliament dominated by Ershad, whose party won a
majority in a 1986 election the opposition contends was rigged. The
20 major opposition parties have no vote in Parliament since they
boycotted elections last March, saying that fair polling could not
be held under Ershad, a former army general who took power in a
bloodless 1982 coup.
;aiting on a Union City street corner for a bus to
New York City, said the presidential campaign has not been
interesting, especially since neither Gov. Thomas H. Kean nor Sen.
Bill Bradley have taken an active role.
   ``They can still be vice president and that would make this a
better election,'' she said.
   On the famed Boardwalk in Atlantic City, tourists seemed to
favor Dukakis, but many stressed that they were ``settling'' only
because they dislike Bush.
   ``He seems as if he's been in the background for the past eight
years, and he hasn't done very much,'' said Ken Stout, who was
taking time out from a Communication Workers of America union
convention.
   ``The only other candidate I might have supported has been
involved in scandals,'' he said. ``I liked Gary Hart _ his
appearance, his charisma.''
   Another Hart fan was found waiting for a train in Newark. Tim
Morin, 21, of Sea Bright, said Hart ``would have made a good
president. I don't care what he does in his private life.''
   Looking realistically at the potential ticket, Morin said he was
satisfied with the Republican and Democratic choices, but ``I like
Dukakis best.''
   Back on the Boardwalk, Stout said the only way Bush could win
``is if he comes up with a strong running mate.''
   Nick Pomponio, a 36-year-old computer technician from Gloucester
Township, said he would like to see Jackson as Dukakis' running
mate.
   ``I think it would be a big boost for minorities,'' he said.
``He (Jackson) seems like he can handle the vice presidential job
and Dukakis seems like he would be a good president.''
   Pedro Rivera disagrees. The Camden resident said he doubts he
will even vote in the general election in November.
   ``I don't think Jesse will be in the running,'' he said.
   Lillian Lazar of Philadelphia looked patriotic dressed in red,
white and blue. But her sentiments over the likely presidential
candidates were largely disappointment.
   ``They're both lousy,'' she said. ``Dukakis is too weak; he's
another Jimmy Carter. And Bush is a big mouth. I don't like his
tactics, and I think he lies. I think he knows more about the
Contra situation but he says he doesn't.''
   Two rare Bush supporters turned up among the Boardwalk's morning
relaxation crowd.
   ``The government now is run by Republicans and it's good so
far,'' said John Ciarlone of Trenton, with his wife, Catherine,
nodding in assent next to him. ``Dukakis is not a strong leader.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Say Contras Attack; Farmers Praise Calm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS COLINAS, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Sandinista army patrols said
Nicaraguan rebels attacked their troops in separate incidents in
the north, and one officer said the insurgents yelled that they had
orders to break a truce.
   A rebel spokesman in Miami who identified himself only as
Joaquin said Saturday night he had no reports of the attacks or
that the cease-fire had ended. ``If they attack our positions, we
have to return fire,'' he said.
   A fragile truce was declared March 21, the start of face-to-face
talks between the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras and the
Soviet-supported government troops.
   But a series of talks, the latest ending on Thursday, made
little headway in ending the civil war that has killed more than
26,000 people.
   The 60-day cease-fire was to end May 31, but the two sides
extended it by tacit agreement, each saying it would initiate no
``offensive'' action against the other but would take defense
action if necessary.
   Second Lt. Julio Cesar Rizo, the commander of a group of
Sandinista soldiers, said Contra rebels ambushed a small unit of
his troops early Saturday in Jinotega province, about 160 miles
northeast of the capital, Managua.
   Rizo said there were no injuries. ``They just started
shooting,'' he said.
   Earlier Saturday, Lt. Ronald Dorado reported heavy fighting
Friday farther north, in Las Colinas.
   ``We sent a message with a farmer to the Contras saying we
wanted to talk,'' said Dorado. ``They responded with rifle fire.''
   Dorado said that during the half hour of fighting, the Contras
yelled to him that ``they had orders to break the truce.'' He said
the government troops suffered no injuries but that one Contra died
and three suffered wounds.
   Residents heard the gunfire but called it minor compared to
fighting in the region before the cease-fire.
   The truce has given many in battle-scarred northern Nicaragua a
chance to resume duties they had abandoned in fear.
   ``It used to be terrible,'' said Griselva Torres, 48. ``There
were bombings, missiles, mortars and shooting all the time.''
   Nearby, around the village of La Rica, several bullet-pocked
homes sat abandoned. Weeds and vines grew over the shells of houses.
   ``Thank God there's a truce,'' Mrs. Torres said.
   La Rica became a ghost town a few years ago because of heavy
fighting. But Nicaraguans have moved back, and a hilltop Sandinista
military base now guards the town.
   Julio Cesar Lago said he had moved away from La Rica but
returned in April, about a month after the cease-fire was signed,
to plant corn before the May rains.
   ``It's calm now, but it was bad,'' he said.
   Dario Rugama, a 40-year-old farmer living in nearby Quebrada
Grande, said the truce has brought peace and freedom of movement to
the region.
   ``We just want to work and live in peace,'' he said. ``Now
there's sort of peace.''

<HEAD>Nome Real Estate Agent Is Dauntless Promoter Of Alaska-Siberia
Connections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, James Stimpfle would
stand on the beach in Nome and release balloons to float across the
Bering Strait, hoping to help thaw a Cold War ban on travel between
Alaska and Siberia.
   People laughed and called him crazy.
   But on Monday, Stimpfle will take off on a flight to Siberia,
accompanied by 80 politicians, Eskimos and reporters, crossing a
border that has been closed for 40 years.
   ``There was a lot of skepticism at first,'' Stimpfle recalled
Thursday from Nome, in a telephone interview often interrupted by
calls from the Alaska governor's office and others helping to plan
Monday's ``Friendship Flight'' to the Siberian city of Provideniya.
   ``There were a lot of people who thought it wouldn't happen in
our lifetime,'' Stimpfle said. ``There were a lot of people who
thought I was eccentric and questioned my loyalty and my
motivations.''
   The real estate agent says his motivations are simple: Two years
ago, at the start of Alaska's oil recession, business was slow and
he had time to think up ways of improving his own fortune and that
of Nome, a town of 3,700 people on Alaska's western coast.
   Stimpfle, 40, figured that if someone could pry open the
Alaska-Siberia border, closed in 1948 because of Cold War tensions,
then Nome could become an economic center for both sides of the
Bering Strait.
   He envisioned increased trade, joint economic ventures, and
tourist excursions by airplanes and cruise ships between Nome and
Siberia.
   He also saw opportunities for cultural exhange. His wife,
Bernadette, is a King Island Eskimo, and Stimpfle heard stories of
how Eskimos earlier this century took boats to Siberia to trade and
visit relatives.
   ``I heard tales of people wanting to go over there, and I
wondered why they weren't doing anything about it,'' Stimpfle said.
   He set out to do something.
   In addition to the balloons, he got a huge ``Peace'' sign in
Russian placed on Little Diomede Island, just three miles from the
Soviet island of Big Diomede in the Bering Strait.
   Stimpfle also fired letters off to American and Soviet leaders.
   ``I've probably written somewhere between 500 and 700 letters _
probably 5,000 to 6,000, including copies,'' he said. ``It was the
shotgun approach. I hit them at the very top, I hit them in the
middle, and I hit them at the bottom.''
   Gradually, Siberia fever began to catch on in Nome. Local radio
station KNOM started broadcasting a weekly update on Siberia-Alaska
events in Russian and English, later adding a Russian ``word of the
day.''
   Stimpfle also was aided by good timing: Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's policy of openness paved the way for improved
Alaska-Siberia relations.
   Last August, the Soviets allowed American swimmer Lynn Cox to
cross from Little Diomede to Big Diomede, and Siberian medical
researchers signed a joint research agreement with Alaskan
scientists in November.
   The biggest break came last fall, when Alaska Airlines jumped on
the ``Friendship Flight'' bandwagon, hoping to establish a regular
tourist route, he said. Government officials who brushed off a real
estate agent's letters about flights to Siberia began getting
similar letters from executives of a major corporation.
   ``As long as just one person was doing it, it never would have
reached this level of credibility,'' Stimpfle said.
   Stimpfle would like to see the whole Bering Sea border opened.
He would like to see more joint ventures in fishing,
telecommunications, and trade.
   Many who once scoffed at his dreams now give him the benefit of
the doubt.
   ``It was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream,''
said Lou Cancelmi, Alaska Airlines spokesman. ``I personally
wondered if this day would ever come.
   ``I don't think Jim Stimpfle ever thought for a moment that it
wouldn't, and that's what it takes to make something like this come
true.''

   Mobs stoned police cars and tried to
burn down a police station in Kashmir state Sunday in clashes that
injured 100 people, including 70 lawmen, the United News of India
said.
   A government increase in electricity rates has prompted three
straight days of protests in the northern state, the agency said.
   Thirty policemen were injured when a mob stoned their station
house in the state capital at Srinagar and attempted to burn it
down.
   Police fired warning shots and burst tear gas canisters in
several neighborhoods of the capital to break up crowds, UNI said.
   At one site, youths throwing firebombs set a billboard on fire.
A number of police cars were stoned, UNI said.
   At least 55 people were injured in clashes on Saturday. Three
people were killed in police firing and more than 30 others were
injured on Friday, the first day of violence. Many shops have been
shuttered since Friday.
   UNI said riot police were out on the streets to enforce an order
prohibiting the gathering of more than five people. Paramilitary
forces have been placed on alert, the news agency said.

<HEAD>Research Shows Drug Restores IQs of Children With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS drug can dramatically boost the
intelligence of youngsters whose brains are damaged by the AIDS
virus and even restores their ability to walk and talk, researchers
said Sunday.
   Damage to the brain is one of the earliest and most devastating
of the effects of the lethal virus in children. The research
suggests that the drug AZT can reverse these symptoms and
apparently bring virus-damaged brain cells back to health.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine
routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults,
it can slow the progression of AIDS but does not cure it.
   The latest research, directed by Dr. Philip A. Pizzo of the U.S.
National Cancer Institute, was presented at the Fourth
International Conference on AIDS.
   Pizzo's findings came unexpectedly during testing of a portable
pump to administer the drug to children. He found that youngsters'
IQ scores increased about 15 points, and many of the other severe
brain symptoms of the virus also went away.
   ``Everybody who looks at this data has to get excited,'' said
Dr. Daniel Hoth of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. ``We are all nervous by small numbers (of
patients studied), but the data itself is very exciting.''
   More than 7,000 people, most of them doctors and scientists,
from 138 countries gathered in Stockholm for the opening Sunday of
the fourzoZO-[64|x}zys, there were 25 deaths among patients
who got AZT alone, compared with 11 among people who got both drugs.
   AIDS damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Justice Department Considering Charges in CIA Stamp Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is considering whether
to file charges against nine CIA employees who two years ago made
thousands of dollars selling misprinted stamps the agency had
acquired for regular postage, a Justice Department spokesman said.
   After the stamp matter become public last September, some of the
stamps, known in the trade as ``CIA inverts,'' were sold by
collectors for as much as $50,000 each. It is not known exactly how
much the CIA employees received for the stamps, but it is known
that the stamps' value increased because of the scandal.
   One collector, John Reznikoff of Stamford, Conn., said last year
he bought 18 of them for nearly $1 million.
   The agency's public integrity section is looking into the
original sale of the stamps in 1986 by CIA employees, said
spokesman Tom Stewart, following a reported internal review of the
case by the CIA. Stewart said the integrity section deals ``in
bringing criminal charges, if necessary.''
   But Stewart indicated no action was imminent.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that the CIA had completed
an internal investigation of the nine employees involved in the
stamp sale and had turned over the matter to the Justice
Department. A CIA spokesman said last September that the agency
investigated and found no wrongdoing in the matter. The employees
replaced the stamps with stamps of equal face value, officials said.
   The stamps are a misprinted version of a $1 stamp that includes
a candlestick and the inscription: ``America's Light Fueled By
Truth and Reason.'' In the misprints, the candlestick is upside
down.
   Department officials are considering whether to bring charges of
theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the
employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 stamps, the Post said.
   Nine of the stamps were either kept by the employees or used in
CIA postage, one was worthless because it was torn, and 85 were
sold to a New Jersey dealer for thousands of dollars, according to
stamp experts.
   The CIA has not released the names of the employees involved.
Postal officials have said that 305 other stamps from the same
printed sheet were either destroyed by postal personnel, used as
postage or discovered and saved by collectors.

<TEXT>
   Bishops in southern Italy have
assailed a plan by NATO to transfer 72 U.S. F-16 fighter-bombers
from Spain to Italy.
   Bishops in Puglia and Calabria, the regions where the planes are
likely to be based, issued statements criticizing the government
for agreeing to accept the fighter wing, which Spain no longer
wants.
   Four Calabrian bishops issued a statement late last week which
they described as an ``ethical evaluation'' of the plan. ``Arms,
when they are a power game, are structures of sin,'' their
statement said.
   They said it would be ``ethically irritating'' if the F-16s are
based in Calabria ``as an economic solution to our long-standing
problems.''
   Earlier in the week, seven Puglian bishops said ``Puglia is
already paying a heavy price in servitude to programs of military
armament'' and the region ``could constitute a top priority
target'' if the planes are based there.
   Spain recently said the jets of the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing
must leave Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid. On June 4, the Italian
government agreed to accept the 72 jets subject to parliamentary
approval.

   Jesse Jackson said Sunday he is not claiming
that the Democrats should offer him the vice presidency ``because I
do not want to push Mike Dukakis to that point,'' but Jackson
reiterated that he deserves serious consideration for the No. 2 job.
   Jackson, runner-up to Michael Dukakis in the race for the
party's presidential nomination, appeared to back down from recent
statements in which he said he should be offered the vice
presidency because of his second-place finish.
   Asked if in his comments he was saying he should be offered the
nomination and then would decide whether to accept it, Jackson
said, ``No, I'm not saying that because I do not want to push Mike
Dukakis to that point. It's not necessary.''
   Jackson, interviewed from Chicago on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press,'' said he has not made a decision on whether he would accept
the vice presidency, but he added, ``I believe I've earned serious
consideration.''
   ``I brought to this campaign a broadened base, a moral tone and
my constituency represents the growth of the Democratic Party,
represents the future of the Democratic Party,'' he said. ``We won
nearly 7 million votes from every sector of the population. We've
earned serious consideration at every level of our party. That
includes the ticket.''
   Confusion over Jackson's position increased this past week when
a Cable News Network report on Thursday quoted Jackson as saying he
wants to be vice president.
   Jackson, asked to clarify the issue, said Friday, ``Let's leave
it at consideration.'' But on Saturday, Jackson said his experience
in foreign policy would strengthen a ticket with Dukakis.
   ``Dukakis says he wants a vice president with foreign policy
experience. Well ...,'' Jackson said, pausing to an ovation from a
Chicago crowd of about 1,200.
   Jackson also said he was not interested in a Cabinet post,
saying, ``an appointment position is also a disappointment
position. A vice presidential position is a constitutional position
from which you cannot be fired because you're elected by the
people.''
   Asked Sunday what was more important _ making history as the
first black on a party ticket or helping the Democrats regain the
White House _ Jackson said he was dedicated to a Democratic victory.
   ``Certainly my commitment is `A' to make America better, and
I've tried to do it every day and every way at great risk. It is to
see my party win,'' he said.
   But Jackson added that he doesn't believe recent polls that show
a Dukakis-Jackson ticket losing in November.
   Jackson later flew to Detroit where he attended the third game
of the National Basketball Association championship between the
Detroit Pistons and the Los Angeles Lakers.
   In the television interview, Jackson backed efforts by his
supporters, meeting in Michigan with other Democrats on the party
platform, to include a call for raising taxes on the rich in the
proposed plank.
   ``We ought to be candid with the American people,'' Jackson
said. ``There's no miraculous way of getting out of this budget
deficit. ... We certainly cannot come out just by collecting the
uncollected taxes of Reaganomics. We must collect some exempted
taxes of Reaganomics.''
   Jackson said President Reagan has given the Republicans ``a
party, now they must pay for the party.''
   The Democratic candidate also agreed with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, who criticized Dukakis for suggesting that the
United States move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
   ``Secretary Shultz is correct and every American president has
taken that position,'' Jackson said. ``Moving that embassy to
Jerusalem would not make Israel more secure and that's our concern
there. It would not be security for Israel, not justice for
Palestinians, not peace for both.''

   Members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and
their supporters will begin a month-long walk Monday to press their
claim for the return of a quarry that yields the red stone used to
make sacred Sioux pipes.
   The Yankton Sioux believe the site outside Pipestone, Minn.,
that is now the Pipestone National Monument was illegally taken
from them by the federal government more than 60 years ago, tribal
Chairman Stephen Cournoyer Jr. said.
   Tribal members also want to stop the use of the soft, red
pipestone to make so-called peace pipes and other items for sale to
tourists, he said.
   ``The sacredness of that pipe is no longer there when people are
using it for their gain. It wasn't intended to be exploited like
that,'' Cournoyer said. ``When everyody's got pipes and they don't
know what they were intended for, that's kind of sacrilegious.''
   The meandering walk will start at Green Grass on the Cheyenne
River Sioux Reservation in the central part of the state. Green
Grass is the home of Arvol Looking Horse, keeper of the original
sacred pipe of the Sioux tribes.
   Organizers said they expect about 100 people will start the
peaceful march, but the group should grow before the walkers reach
the quarry in southwestern Minnesota on July 15.
   Looking Horse said he became involved in the walk because he's
worried about the use of pipestone to make inappropriate items. The
pipe was given to the Sioux by the Great Spirit and smoking it is a
central part of their beliefs, said Looking Horse, who said he's
the 19th-generation keeper of the pipe.
   ``That's the blood of our people, the red pipestone,'' Looking
Horse said. ``Now there's a lot of misuse and abuse of the pipe at
Pipestone.''
   Looking Horse said people from as far away as California and New
York have called to say they plan to join in the walk. ``Because
there's a lot of people coming back to the old ways, like the young
people, I feel there's going to be a lot of people'' on the walk,
he said.
   Before Europeans arrived, pipes and other items made from the
stone were traded to many other tribes.
   The Yankton Sioux Tribal Council has passed a resolution asking
the federal government and the Pipestone Indian Shrine Association,
a non-profit organization that helps market items carved from the
stone, to give up the monument.
   The resolution says 1858 and 1892 treaties with the federal
government guaranteed the Yankton Sioux's ownership and use of the
quarry. The site was sold to the government in the late 1920s, but
the Yankton Sioux claim the sale was invalid because it was
negotiated by tribal members handpicked by federal officials.
   Vince Halvorson, superintendent of Pipestone National Monument,
said the Yankton Sioux were paid for the quarry area, which
includes a small stream, scenic low cliffs, a museum and a
protected area of prairie vegetation, and the monument was
established by Congress in 1937.
   ``The issue, as we see it, was settled in 1928 or 1929 when they
received payment,'' Halvorson said.
   However, Halvorson said he believes the Yankton Sioux have the
right to attempt to regain the quarry under the Indian Religious
Freedom Act.
   The pipestone, also known as catlinite for artist-explorer
George Catlin, is quarried only by Indians, who get permits and use
hand tools.
   Federal officials have no control over what items are made and
sold outside the monument, but only items that represent Indian
culture are sold at the monument, Halvorson said.
   Up to 90 people depend on the quarry to make a living, he said.
   However, Looking Horse said it's not proper for the sacred stone
to be used for a commercial purpose.
   ``Because this is sacred to us, we are doing all we can to
protect it,'' Looking Horse said. ``The only thing I want is to
stop the misuse of that pipestone.''

<DATELINE>VICKSBURG, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mighty Mississippi could hit record
low levels this summer because of the drought plaguing the Midwest
and northern Plains, and already has fallen enough in places to
ground barges, officials say.
   The river stood at just 8 feet on the Vicksburg gauge on May 28,
the second-lowest reading on record for that date. By Friday, it
had fallen to 3.8 feet, and it was expected to fall to 3 feet by
Monday and continue dropping.
   Monday's predicted reading would be the record low for this time
of year _ about 30 feet below normal. The lowest reading at
Vicksburg for any date was in the early 1930s when the river
dropped to minus 6.7 feet below the level considered as the zero
point.
   At Memphis, Tenn., the river could sink below the 7{-year-old
record of minus 7.3 feet by July 13, according to a 28-day forecast
released by the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center in Slidell,
La.
   ``The river is still very deep and dangerous, but this is a
record low,'' said Michael Logue, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers' Vicksburg District.
   In some areas, the river remains deeper than 100 feet, Logue
said. But many points along the boat traffic channel have fallen
below the minimum 9-foot depth needed for normal navigation.
   That means big problems for towboat operators who must lighten
cargoes and run the risk of equipment damage if they run aground.
   Robin Radlein of the National Weather Service River Forecasting
Center in Slidell, La., said it would take heavy rainfall over a
large part of the central United States to raise the river
appreciably. And that's not likely this time of year.
   ``The types of stages we're reporting now are similar to what
you'd normally get in late September, after a hot, dry summer,''
she said. ``And we've still got that ahead of us.''
   Normally, this would be the high water season, Logue said, but
the Vicksburg District expects to have to dredge soon near
Greenville to keep the channel open.
   ``It looks like it's going to be a major challenge this year to
maintain our navigation project,'' Logue said. ``I'm sure the
economic impact is in the millions of dollars already from people
having to carry shallow loads. It has an impact on the whole
central part of the country.''
   Steve Golding, owner of Ole Man River Towing Co. in Vicksburg,
said the drought has cut into his profits.
   Ole Man River is loading barges for a draft of 8.6 feet rather
than the normal 9.6 feet, ``and that last foot sometimes is your
only profit margin,'' Golding said. Current cargoes generally are
about 10 to 15 percent lighter, he said.
   The cost of pushing the load is the same or higher, because
trips take longer, Golding said. Maintenance costs are higher
because of problems with running aground, he said.
   Golding said the navigable channel is so narrow in places that
northbound tows must wait downstream for southbound towboats to
pass.
   Last weekend, 55 barges ran aground at Memphis, closing that
stretch of the river for two days while the tows were disassembled
and moved.
   Friday, the river was reopened from Cairo, Ill., to St. Louis
for the first time in two days after numerous tows ran aground. The
Red River, a Louisiana tributary of the Mississippi, is closed
indefinitely, with some boats stranded upstream.
   ``It makes for an unpredictable trip,'' Golding said. ``And it
puts a lot of stress on the pilots. Last week, we ran aground with
one barge and knocked a hole in the bottom. We also knocked a
rudder off one of our boats.''

   Looking for a good, reliable, used jail? Low
mileage? The folks at the Lake County Courthouse have just the
thing.
   Lake County is peddling its old jail, bragging that it's a real
creampuff with great maneuverability. Advertisements in national
law enforcement and government trade magazines tout its air
conditioning, sleek security glass and electronic door controls.
   But this slammer has been around the block. In fact, it's been
around the state, having started in Peoria before getting sent up
the river, literally, to Waukegan.
   Lake County bought it in 1985 for $101,000 from Peoria County to
alleviate an overcrowding problem. The entire jail _ all 20 cells _
was loaded on a barge and shipped up the Illinois River to the
Chicago River. From there, the jail traveled up the western shore
of Lake Michigan to Waukegan Harbor and its location on county
property near the new Lake County criminal justice center.
   The county is accepting sealed bids until the end of July.

   The Maufroy clan is celebrating a doubly
blessed event _ not only the birth of a child, but the first girl
born into the family in 140 years.
   Asleep in her mother's arms, little Ashley Renee Maufroy seemed
unaware of the fuss being made over her by doting relatives as they
snapped pictures and chatted excitedly at a recent family gathering.
   Ashley's great-grandfather, Rene Maufroy, 77, said his
grandfather had two sisters in the 1840s.
   ``That's the last time girls have been in the family and then
this one came along,'' he said. ``I'll say, she's quite welcomed.''
   The elder Maufroy doesn't remember how many sons his
great-grandfather had, but his grandfather had one. His father had
one son; he has two sons; and his son has three.
   The lucky day came on May 13, when Leon Maufroy Jr.'s wife,
Kristy, gave birth to their 8-pound-12-ounce girl at Waterman
Medical Center.
   Dr. Harry Ostrer, an assistant professor at the genetics
division of the University of Florida in Gainesville, said the
Maufroy family is a rare case.
   He said he could not determine why girls have been rare in the
family without studying the Maufroys' background. However, ``the
likelihood (of having so many boys) is extremely low,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alabama Charity Concert Draws Estimated 35,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT PAYNE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   June Jams are a thing of the future for
Alabama, says the country band's lead singer Randy Owen.
   The group's seventh annual charity concert Saturday drew 35,000,
and Owen said past problems won't deter the group from keeping the
concert a tradition.
   Saturday's attendance was far below the 61,000 people who showed
up in 1986, when Alabama was at the peak of its popularity. But
last year's June Jam was hit with heavy rain and paid attendance
fell to 20,000, leaving no money for charity.
   The first five June Jams raised $1.5 million.
   Because of last year's problems, Owen and other band members
fought rumors that this year's concert would not occur. Once plans
became final for Saturday's concert, the band members had to dispel
rumors that this would be the last.
   Owen said he is already making plans to mark the state's
homecoming celebration, Alabama Reunion, at June Jam VIII.
Festivities will include having the Alabama Symphony Orchestra join
the band on stage to sing its hit ``My Home's in Alabama.''
   Many entertainers joined Alabama for the daylong concert,
including the Charlie Daniels Band, Exile, K.T. Oslin, Carl
Perkins, the Bellamy Brothers, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Dan Seals,
Gary Morris and Ricky Van Shelton.
   Fans began lining up for the concert 12 days early. First in
line was Julie Hall, 19, of Bowling Green, Ky. Miss Hall, who has
seen the last four jams, said, ``I sacrifice my social life,
everything, for the two weeks.''
   At the concert site she lived out of her red Ford Escort, which
was packed with clothes, suntan lotion, and a boombox.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's interior minister on Sunday denied
a Western news report that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is dying of
cancer and said the leader is healthy.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted Ali Akbar Mohtashemi as saying that he met Khomeini several
days ago and that he is ``now in perfect shape.''
   Western analysts believe that a power struggle with Tehran's
fractious hierarchy will intensify as various factions seek to
seize control of the Islamic revolution after the 87-year-old
Khomeini dies.
   Mohtashemi said in an interview in Sunday's edition of the
English-language Tehran Times daily that the foreign media has been
claiming for years that Khomeini's health was failing.
   He charged that the latest report in the United States by the
CBS television network was ``a Zionist scheme to cheer up Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and his demoralized army.''
   Iran has been at war with Iraq since September 1980.
   CBS said on Thursday that intelligence reports indicated that
Khomeini ``may now be very close to death.'' It quoted the reports
as saying ``the Ayatollah's cancer has spread from his prostate to
his liver'' and that he ``may only have two or three months to
live.''
   Mohtashemi, a hard-liner linked with Shiite Moslem extremists
holding foreign hostages in Lebanon, said the report could be seen
as an Israeli-U.S. response to Khomeini's appointment of Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani as acting commander-in-chief of Iran's
armed forces.
   Khomeini named Rafsanjani, one of his closest aides, as military
chief in the wake of two battlefield defeats by Iraq in the nearly
8-year-old gulf war.
   Khomeini has long been reported to be in a frail condition since
he suffered a heart attack two years ago, touching off scores of
reports he was dead or dying.
   He was last seen in public May 13, when he briefly shuffled into
the street outside his heavily guarded home in the north Tehran
suburb of Jamaran to vote in parliamentary elections.
   Khomeini held the post of comander-in-chief under Iran's
revolutionary constitution and had only relinquished it once before
since 1979, when he appointed President Abdolhassan Bani Sadr in
1980. Bani Sadr fled Iran a year later, hounded by radicals who
considered him too liberal.
   Khomeini's apppointment of Rafsanjani rekindled speculation that
the aging patriarch's condition was deteriorating. Khomeini has
appeared fragile and slow-moving in his few recent public
appearances broadcast by Iran's state-run television, also
monitored in Nicosia.
   Speculation that Khomeini was ailing heightened Friday after
IRNA reported that Rafsanjani and President Ali Khamenei had
visited Khomeini's designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri, in the holy city of Qom, 100 miles south of Tehran, on
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The agency said the men discussed ``various current issues''
with Montazeri. But it did not elaborate or give any indication
that the meetings were linked to Khomeini's health.
   Rafsanjani and Khamenei are rivals in the power struggle under
way within the Tehran hierarchy over who will run the country in
the post-Khomeini era.
   Although Khomeini has designated Montazeri, 65, his successor,
the high-ranking cleric lacks Khomeini's power base.
   He also has been opposed by several leading figures, including
Rafsanjani, long considered the most powerful figure in Iran after
Khomeini.
   When the patriatch appointed Rafsanjani as military leader, he
said he had acted at the urging of Khamenei, chairman of the
Supreme Defense Council.
   But most analysts believe that Khomeini said that to avoid
publicly humiliating Khamenei, whose power has been eroded in
recent months, and deepening the political divisions in Iran.

<HEAD>Poll: Majority Would Oppose Third Reagan Term</HEAD>

   A substantial majority of Americans say they
would not vote for Ronald Reagan, winner of two landslide
presidential elections, if he could seek a third term, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Most Republicans in the national poll supported Reagan for
another term. But Democrats and independents, whose support was
critical to his 1980 and 1984 victories, said overwhelmingly they
would not back him again.
   The decline in Reagan's support outside his own party could
impede his ability to draw non-Republicans to Vice President George
Bush, who has locked up the 1988 GOP presidential nomination. Bush
needs outside votes to win.
   In another finding, three-quarters of the 1,204 respondents said
a vice presidential candidate's race or sex did not matter to them.
However, some independents and Republicans were less likely to
support a black, and some Republicans were less likely to support a
woman.
   The survey also found that Americans overwhelmingly would not
want to be president, and a plurality would not want their child to
have the job. Still, 59 percent thought it possible their child
could be president.
   In 1984, Reagan won 25 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of
independent voters. But in the survey, just 13 percent of Democrats
and 27 percent of independents said they would vote for him for a
third term.
   Presidents are limited by constitutional amendment to two
four-year terms in office, and roughly 65 percent each of
Republicans, Democrats and independents favored maintaining that
limit.
   But if Reagan could run again, 60 percent of Republicans said
they would vote for him, while 85 percent of Democrats and 67
percent of independents said they would not. The total was 32
percent for Reagan, 64 percent against.
   Majorities of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike
opposed a third Reagan term. Women and poorer Americans were more
likely to object.
   On vice presidential candidates, 75 percent said it would not
matter to them if a ticket's second slot were filled by a black or
a woman.
   Still, 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely
to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president, compared with
4 percent who would be more likely to back it. The division was
wider among Republicans, while there was no measurable split among
Democrats.
   No potential candidate was specified in the survey. Black civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson, second-place finisher for the
Democratic nomination for president, has said he should be
considered for the vice presidential slot.
   With a woman for vice president, 20 percent of Republicans said
they would be less likely to support the ticket, compared with 6
percent more likely. There was no such reluctance among Democrats
or independents.
   Again, no potential candidate was specified. There have been
suggestions that Bush select a woman running mate to shore up his
support among women.
   Overall, 10 percent of the respondents said they would be more
likely to support a woman for vice president, and 14 percent said
less likely. That split came within the margin of sampling error of
three points.
   Given a black vice presidential candidate, 6 percent overall
said they would be more likely to lend their support, 18 percent
less likely.
   More than six in 10 said it would not matter to them if a
candidate for president were a black or a woman. Five percent said
they would be more likely to support a black for president, 27
percent less likely. Ten percent said they would be more likely to
back a woman, 25 percent less likely.
   Asked if they would want the job of president, 89 percent said
no. Forty-six percent said they would not want their child to grow
up to be president, while 41 percent would.
   But 89 percent said it matters who gets the job.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204
adults across the nation. Media General Inc., a communications
company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune

<HEAD>Government Launches Ad Campaign Promoting Local Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two days after banning calls
for election boycotts, the government Sunday launched an
advertising campaign to promote participation in municipal
elections scheduled for October.
   Full-page newspaper ads urged South Africans to ``let your vote
speak for you'' in the nationwide elections Oct. 26.
   ``Vote for a better life for yourself and those who are dear to
you,'' said another ad. ``Let the people of South Africa be heard.''
   It will be the first time South Africans of all races go to the
polls on the same day. They will be voting for more than 7,000
seats on municipal councils in their racially segregated
communities.
   Most anti-apartheid organizations in South Africa, as well as
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, oppose
black participation in any elections until the black majority is
granted full political rights at the national level.
   The black ANC movement is fighting the government's policy of
apartheid, which establishes a racially segregated society in which
the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The government, while describing itself as ``pro-democracy,''
says it will never accept a one-person, one-vote system that would
allow the blacks to overrule the 5 million whites.
   On Friday, when it extended a national state of emergency for a
third year, the government imposed a new regulation outlawing calls
for boycotts of elections, except by a registered political party
competing in an election.
   The far-right Conservative Party, which opposes even limited
concessions to blacks, charged that the $2.3 million ad campaign
constitutes use of taxpayers' money to spread propaganda on behalf
of President P.W. Botha's National Party.
   A confidential outline of the ad campaign, disclosed by a
Conservative Party leader who obtained a copy, said the
government's public credibility was not good. An advertising agency
suggested in the document that animated cartoon characters be used
in television ads to promote voting, because direct communication
from the government might be ``unacceptable to the public.''
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe defended the campaign
last week, saying it was not partisan.
   ``It is pro-democracy and anti-revolutionary, for which we do
not apologize,'' he said.
   The ads published Sunday exhorted voters to ``vote for the
candidate who will best look after your interests.''
   The white municipal elections will provide the Conservative
Party with another chance to gain strength at the expense of the
National Party. The Conservatives won three parliamentary
by-elections earlier this year, and they predict a sweep of local
elections in towns and small cities throughout Transvaal province
in the north, where more than half of South Africa's whites live.
   The key question in the black municipal elections is whether the
government can prevent disruptions by militants and persuade a
significant number of candidates to participate, despite the
likelihood that these will be depicted as apologists for the
government.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan told Parliament last month that
``radicals and revolutionaries ... regard the elections as a prime
target for disruption and intimidation.''
   ``It is my duty and your duty to ensure that these elections are
a success,'' he told lawmakers.

   Police detained a Japanese teen-ager Sunday
after a dismantled rifle, a pellet gun, several dummy hand grenades
and explosives were found in his luggage at Philadelphia
International Airport, authorities said.
   Police evacuated one of the five terminals after the 18-year-old
college student tried to check in at the last minute for the early
morning Northwest Airlines Flight 7 to Tokyo via Minneapolis and
Los Angeles, said Detective Warren Rosen.
   When the youth's baggage was examined, the rifle and grenades
were found along with the pellet gun, carbon dioxide cartridges,
fireworks and flares, police Capt. Stanley Puchalski said. Also
found was explosive black powder and some unspecified ammunition
that police were checking to see if it was live, he said.
   Bomb squad officers were called to the terminal, and by late
morning it was operating normally, Puchalski said.
   ``All this stuff was concealed in one way or another in his
luggage,'' said bomb squad Sgt. Bob Garrison.
   The youth, whose name was not released, was identified only as a
student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who was traveling
under a Japanese passport.
   He was held at the airport while FBI agents, who assumed
jurisdiction over the case, interviewed the youth, Puchalski said.
No charges were immediately filed.
   The FBI would not comment when asked if the student had any
links to Yu Kikumara, a Japanese national with links to the
terrorist Japanese Red Army, arrested in April on a New Jersey
highway with explosives.

   Gunmen in passing cars killed a
Roman Catholic man Sunday near a church in north Belfast and shot
another Catholic man in the back in west Belfast, police said.
   Police said they could not immediately link the two attacks.
   Friends identified the man killed in north Belfast as William
Totten, 46.
   He was about to get into a car outside his sister's house when
he was shot by attackers in another car that drove up alongside,
police said. The house was near a church, and dozens of people
attending Mass witnessed the attack.
   At least one of the bullets hit Totten in the head. He was given
first aid by some of the churchgoers but died almost instantly.
   Police appealed to the dozens of men, women and children who
witnessed the slaying to come forward.
   Totten was a driver with the Northern Ireland Department of
Environment and lived with his two brothers in west Belfast.
   Police said a 23-year-old Catholic man waiting for a ride in
west Belfast was shot in the back by assailants in a passing car.
   The man, who was not identified, was taken to the Royal Victoria
Hospital, where his condition was described as ``not serious.''
   In a third incident, police said six policemen were slightly
injured Sunday when a drunken mob of about 600 Protestants hurled
bricks, bottles and stones at them in the town of Armagh.
   Five people were arrested and a police officer fired a single
shot into the air to quell the trouble.
   Security forces said the shootings appeared to have been carried
out by Protestant extremists fighting the Catholic Irish Republican
Army.
   The killing was the 31st this year in Northern Ireland's
sectarian war, in which the outlawed IRA is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the neighboring Catholic
Irish Republic.
   The two killings bring the official death toll since 1969 in the
province to 2,649.

   Police guarding a site where European
toxic waste was secretly dumped withdrew after chemists confirmed
the material was poisonous, the News Agency of Nigeria said Sunday.
   Assistant police inspector Aminu Malumfashi said they left the
site in Bendel state for their own safety, the agency said. They
had sealed off the area to keep the public away.
   The military government announced Saturday that preliminary
tests of waste show the substances to be poisonous. Scientists
urged that all people who visited the area undergo medical tests.
   The waste, which included radioactive material, was dumped near
the town of Koko, 150 miles southeast of Lagos.
   The dumping episode, the latest in a series of alleged efforts
by European and American companies to dump hazardous waste in West
Africa, has strained relations between Nigeria and Italy.
   Nigeria has recalled its ambassador to Rome and demanded that an
Italian ship remove the waste, which had been imported by an
Italian company working for 10 European firms.
   Italy has said it is cooperating in an investigation.
   Norway, whose honorary consul general in Guinea was arrested for
complicity in the dumping of waste there, said the waste would be
returned to Norway.
   On May 31, five Congolese, including three senior government
officials, were charged with plotting to secretly import toxic
waste for dumping there.

<TEXT>
   A longtime friend of House Speaker Jim
Wright says he paid Wright $6,000 for copies of his books as a
legal way to get around federal limits on campaign contributions.
   Fort Worth developer S. Gene Payte, who has known Wright since
he entered Congress in 1955, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he
bought 1,000 copies of the book to ``show my appreciation.''
   Federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to
$1,000 for each election.
   Payte said knew about the limit but wanted to find a way to
boost Wright's income, the Star-Telegram reported Sunday.
   ``If I wanted to help Jim and wanted to give him some money, I
couldn't do it,'' he said. ``But I could buy his books.''
   Payte also said he wrote letters to nearly 50 Fort Worth
businessmen urging them each to buy $1,000 worth of the books, but
did not know if they followed up on the request. He would not name
them.
   The House Ethics Committee decided last week to conduct a
inquiry to determine if Wright has violated rules on ethics and
conflicts of interest.
   One aspect of the inquiry will be the publication arrangements
for his 1984 book ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Fort Worth orthodontist Gene Wood, another longtime Wright
friend, said he paid $1,000 to publisher William Carlos Moore after
Moore told him he was trying to put together a group of about 20
people to finance republication of the book last year.
   ``I paid to have some republished and a big box (of books) was
sent to me,'' Wood said. He added that he had already given Wright
the maximum $1,000 in campaign contributions.
   Wright has acknowledged that some supporters bought large
numbers of books, but said it wasn't an attempt to get around
contribution limits.
   ``I think that's a mistake,'' Wright said. ``I don't think
anybody really thought that.''
   Wright instead said, ``I'm glad they thought enough of the
book.''
   Meanwhile, another longtime Fort Worth friend of Wright said he
was present when Wright asked a congressional aide if he would
``sacrifice a couple of weekends'' to work on the book.
   Ben Procter, professor of history at Texas Christian University,
located in Fort Worth, recalled the request in a sworn statement
Wright provided the ethics committee Friday.
   One charge the committee will investigate is whether Wright paid
the aide, Matthew Cossolotto, $2,000 in public money to help
compile the book.
   The House ethics manual says congressional employees may not be
paid from public funds to perform personal or campaign activities
on behalf of a congressman.

<HEAD>Alligator Attack Heats Up Turf War Between Man And Beast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Santiago used to sit back and chuckle when
an alligator ventured onto the lawn of his lakefront home, but now
he says he'll blast any gator foolish enough to crawl within pistol
range.
   For Santiago and other waterfront residents in Florida, the
alligator's image has changed dramatically from an amusing visitor
to a deadly menace _ a change prompted by the recent fatal
alligator attack on a 4-year-old girl in the Gulf Coast community
of Englewood.
   Erin Glover was walking a dog with two playmates in the
ankle-deep water of a pond June 4 when a 10{ foot-long bull gator
lunged from the water and snapped the child in its jaws, dragging
her underwater to her death.
   For Santiago, the turf war between man and beast heats up
whenever he broils a couple of steaks on his charcoal grill in the
Dade County neighborhood, wafting an aroma that one 6-foot
``neighborhood'' gator finds irresistible.
   ``He crawls up the bank right into our back yard and sits there
with his back arched _ just staring,'' said Santiago, a 67-year-old
Cuban exile who moved in last year. ``The last time I went and got
my gun, but he saw me coming and ran away.''
   ``We're seeing a lot of panic out there,'' said Lt. Dick
Lawrence of the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.
   In the week following Erin's death, game officials in the
state's five regional offices were swamped with 849 complaints from
residents wanting alligators removed _ about five times the normal
load.
   ``I try to calm them down but they won't take `no' for an
answer,'' said Lawrence, who supervises the nuisance-alligator
program in 10 south Florida counties. ``Some say if we don't come
out there and destroy the gator in their neighborhood, they're
going to do it themselves,''
   Game officials last week received a report that a hysterical
woman living near the fatal attack ``bashed a 3-foot gator's head
in.''
   ``It made her feel a little bit better, but it didn't accomplish
anything,'' said Lt. Jim Farrior of the game commisson, adding that
alligators that small eat only minnows and frogs, not people.
   About 80 percent of the complaints result in a permit issued to
destroy the gator, said Lt. Mitchell Brown in Lakeland. Last year,
3,853 alligators were killed, he said.
   ``Our main concerns are with a gator that's been fed,'' said Lt.
Jim Huffstodt, a game commission spokesman in West Palm Beach.
``People think it's real cute to treat the gator like a pet and
give it a name and toss it scraps of food and marshmallows.
   ``Over time, the gator loses its fear of people and begins to
associate people with food _ that's setting the stage for a
tragedy,'' Huffstodt said. He added that any bold action toward
humans, pets or livestock is enough to order a gator destroyed.
   That job is turned over to state-licensed trappers, a select
group of experts allowed to kill alligators and profit from the
armored underbelly skin and the bland-tasting meat.
   But the fact is, the odds of getting attacked by a gator in
Florida are about the same as getting struck by lightning, game
officials say.
   The latest death marks the sixth documented gator killing along
with 95 unprovoked attacks in Florida since 1948, according to game
commission statistics.
   ``These are the consequences we face as a growing state where
people choose to crowd their houses onto the alligator's native
habitat,'' said Bernie Yokel of the Florida Audubon Society in
Maitland. ``We sometimes forget the gator was here first.''
   Biologists estimate there are anywhere from 1 million to 6
million gators in Florida, nesting in swamps and marshes and even
winding their way through drainage tunnels into freshwater pockets
of sprawling urban areas.
   In September, the state will lift a 1962 hunting ban and open a
tightly controlled month-long season with a strict kill limit of
3,000 gators, a number not expected to make a dent in the huge
population.
   But homeowner Santiago says he still feels a cold shiver of fear
whenever he hears the gator's low bellow in the night.
   Santiago has forbidden his nine young grandchildren from playing
near the water when they visit; he has ordered a chain-link fence
built around his home and he has called on game officials to remove
his problem gator.
   ``I couldn't live with myself,'' he said, ``if anything happened
to one of my grandchildren.''

<HEAD>Slovenians Demand Release Of Jailed Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people in Slovenia, the
nation's most liberal republic, have demanded the release of two
journalists arrested after reporting the armed forces planned a
coup in Slovenia.
   Yugoslav President Raif Dizdarevic said an army tribunal's probe
of Janez Jansa and David Tasic will be completed soon, a newspaper
in Ljubljana, the capital of the western republic, reported
Saturday.
   The Delo newspaper said Dizdarevic assured Slovenian President
Janez Stanovnik during a meeting in Belgrade on Thursday that ``the
public would be informed fully as soon as the procedure is over.''
   An army sergeant-major also was arrested, apparently on
suspicion of providing Jansa with a secret document whose contents
were not disclosed.
   More than 7,000 people in Slovenia have signed a petition for
the release of the three men and the arrests have led to a wave of
protests in the republic.
   More than 200 Communist Party cells, companies and trade union
organizations are reported to have donated money into a special
defense fund.
   The two well-known reporters were arrested in Ljubljana on
suspicion of revealing military secrets. Both journalists have
written numerous articles criticizing the military. Jansa was taken
into custody May 31 and Tasic was arrested five days later.
   The coup reports were denied by the Yugoslav government, but
copies of documents purported to be the minutes of a military
advisory body's session and alleging that such a plan existed, have
been widely circulated in Slovenia.
   All three men were being held in a military prison in the
Slovenian capital while the investigation is handled by the army's
judicial branch.
   Except for two brief communiques by the army prosecutor, the
military has not revealed any details about the charges.
   Jansa and Tasic were denied civilian defense attorneys, a highly
unusual procedure in Yugoslavia and were held incommunicado until
Thursday when family members were allowed to visit them.
   Slovenia has long been more liberal than the rest of Yugoslavia
and an irritant to Yugoslavia's communist establishment. Mladina, a
youth weekly in the republic, has often criticized the army and
advocated such liberal causes as conscientious objectors,
homosexuals and the environment.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Seek to Broaden Appeal Among Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The two presidential contenders sought Sunday to broaden their
appeal among blacks, with Republican George Bush urging a strong
civil rights agenda and Democrat Michael Dukakis meeting with black
mayors and promising a tough policy in the war on drugs.
   Dukakis, in a speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Salt
Lake City, lashed out at the Reagan administration's anti-drug
programs, criticizing the president's cuts in the Coast Guard
budget and federal aid to state and local police in light of his
tough rhetoric on the issue.
   ``What we have today is chaos,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got to
back up what we say with what we do.''
   The Massachusetts governor also met with Democratic mayors and
held a private session with a smaller group of black mayors.
   The likely Democratic nominee called for tougher drug laws and
stringent sentencing guidelines, but he stopped short of urging
capital punishment for drug dealers. Bush has criticized Dukakis
for failing to endorse the death penalty for major drug traffickers.
   The vice president, meanwhile, delivered the commencement
address at a predominantly black college in Wilberforce, Ohio,
where he told the 275 graduates of Central State University that
the nation needs a ``positive civil rights agenda.''
   Bush added that the policy must go beyond that to ``knock down
the walls of indifference and other barriers that result in
economic exclusion.''
   The certain GOP nominee, responding to reporters' questions,
said he would work ``to broaden the base of our party, talk on the
issues that I think transcend black, white, American issues that
are out there and are going to appeal.''
   Bush, who celebrated his 64th birthday, received an honorary
Doctor of Laws degree from the college. The award was announced
last year, but Bush was unable to receive it until Sunday, said Ed
Chamness, a spokesman for the university.
   In his speech, Bush told the graduates they made it though
college despite ``poverty, broken homes, inadequate schools and the
social challenges or threat of drugs and violence.''
   Dukakis, focusing on the drug issue in his speech to the
nation's mayors, said that the war on drugs can be won, ``but we
have to recognize that it is a war, a war of wills, a war of
values, a war of confidence and courage and strength.''
   Dukakis promised that if elected he would increase federal law
enforcement staffs and federal aid to state and local police. He
did not provide specifics.
   He also said he would issue an executive order prohibiting the
payment of CIA or other government funds to suspected drug dealers,
a reference to alleged payments to Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug
peddler who is poisoning our society and killing our children,''
Dukakis said.
   Jesse Jackson, runner-up to Dukakis in the presidential
nomination sweepstakes, appeared to back down from claims that the
Democrats should offer him the vice presidency based on his
second-place showing.
   Asked if in his recent comments he was saying he should be
offered the nomination and then would decide whether to accept it,
Jackson said, ``No, I'm not saying that because I do not want to
push Mike Dukakis to that point. It's not necessary.''
   Jackson, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said he has
not made a decision on whether he would accept the vice presidency,
but added, ``I believe I've earned serious consideration.''
   Jackson backed efforts by his supporters, meeting in Michigan
with other Democrats on the party platform, to include a call for
raising taxes on the rich in the proposed plank.
   ``We ought to be candid with the American people,'' Jackson
said. ``There's no miraculous way of getting out of this budget
deficit. ... We certainly cannot come out just by collecting the
uncollected taxes of Reaganomics. We must collect some exempted
taxes of Reaganomics.''
   Jackson said that President Reagan has given the Republicans ``a
party, now they must pay for the party.''
   The Democrats, winding up their weekend meeting, sidestepped the
question of the federal deficit and whether to call for higher
taxes on the rich.
   The party regulars did agree to brand South Africa a terrorist
state, called for the appointment of a federal drug czar, adoption
of the Equal Rights Amendment, an end to homelessness, expansion of
AIDS research and providing advance notice of plant closings.
   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.
William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panels' chair,
following the three-day meeting on Mackinac Island.

<TEXT>
   City officials have learned the answer to
the question on their promotional T-shirts: ``Where the heck's
Decatur?''
   There's a Decatur almost everywhere, from Alaska to Mississippi
_ 28 at last count.
   And the smaller Decaturs have accepted the challenge of the
largest to collect food for the poor and put themselves on the map.
   Local organizers created ``Cans Across The Country'' to see
which Decatur could collect the most food and provide it to hungry
people in each of the communities. The goal is one can of food for
each resident _ a potential of about 200,000 cans.
   ``The real winners will be the recipients of the food,'' said
Ann Lewellen of The Decatur Advantage, an organization that
promotes the Illinois city of about 94,000 residents.
   ``But every Decatur that participates will be a winner because a
grass-roots movement with volunteers working for a common good
generates a spirit of unity. That makes a community stronger,'' she
said.
   Ms. Lewellen initially identified nine other cities of Decatur
and two Decatur counties, and Mayor Gary Anderson mailed a white
glove to each to begin the competition Memorial Day weekend.
   The official T-shirt of the contest has a United States map on
the front. The question mark in ``Where the heck's Decatur?'' rests
in Illinois.
   But, as word of the contest spread across the country, Illinois
officials realized their count of 12 Decaturs was short.
   ``This little town of Decatur in New York called,'' said Ms.
Lewellen. ``Decatur townships surfaced. There's even one in San
Juan County, Wash., population 20, except in the summer when it's
100. Many of them don't even have a zip code.''
   Her count rose to 25. The Decatur Herald & Review did some
additional research and identified 28 Decaturs.
   ``I'm not sure we're through finding Decaturs yet,'' said the
mayor. ``But, the more the merrier.''
   All are welcome in the contest, which has has been divided into
three divisions based on population. There are no prizes, said the
mayor, ``just satisfaction and pride.''
   Officials from all the Decaturs will be invited to the opening
ceremony of Decatur Celebration here Aug. 5. The winners will be
announced then, although some Decatur officials figure they have
victory wrapped up.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind,'' said Mayor Bobby Wilson of
Decatur, Texas. ``We've never been beaten at anything. I'll be
there to pick up my first-place trophy and to bring y'all some
chili and jalapeno peppers.''
   The mayor of Decatur, Ga., promised Anderson a consolation prize
of a pinto bean-and-peanut butter sandwich, and Mayor Bill Dukes of
Decatur, Ala., said schoolchildren brought 7,000 cans of food in
just one day, and ``we're going to beat Decatur, Ill.''
   Anderson said the contest will increase public awareness about
all of the Decaturs _ communities named for Commodore Stephen
Irving Decatur, a patriot and U.S. Navy hero in the War of 1812.

<TEXT>
   A special commission created by Gov. Mario
Cuomo called Sunday for cuts in federal spending, consideration of
tax increases and a longer school year to deal with what it says is
the country's economic crisis.
   The Cuomo Commission on Trade and Competitiveness said the
nation's leaders should consider a freeze on military spending;
taxing Social Security benefits of wealthier Americans; and a
reduction of farm subsidies that benefit large producers.
   The commission also recommmended higher taxes for luxury items
and consideration of a $10-per-barrel oil import fee and the
imposition of a value-added tax on goods and services. The
commission said that, if adopted, both the oil import fee and the
value-added tax should be structured to insulate the poor.
   ``The commission believes that future fiscal policy must be
based on a combination of reduced spending and increased revenue,''
said the 259-page report from the 20-member task force that
included businessmen, labor leaders and economists.
   The Cuomo Commission Report is being published as a paperback by
Simon and Schuster and will be available in book stores as early as
Monday, said Cuomo spokeswoman Anne Crowley.
   Cuomo, once considered a potential 1988 Democratic presidential
candidate, has been pushing economic reform for months. In addition
to creating the Cuomo Commission in January 1987, the New York
governor led the drive for the National Economic Commission, which
was approved by President Reagan in December.
   The commission, which is due to report after the November
election, is headed by former Democratic Party Chairman Robert
Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis, a former U.S. secretary of
transportation. Other members include Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
and New York financier Felix Rohatyn.
   The national commission is to prepare recommendations on the
national deficit, trade imbalance, Third World debt and
productivity _ the same issues dealt with by the Cuomo Commission.
   ``The word `crisis' has been cheapened by too frequent use, but
no other word so well describes America's present situation,'' the
Cuomo Commission concluded. ``Either America will implement reforms
that strengthen the international trading system and make the
nation more competitive at home or it risks a long, slow national
decline.''
   The major problems facing the nation on the economic front are
the trade deficit and the federal deficit, according to the
commission.
   The commission said the United States must improve its
production capabilities, in part through greater employee
participation; work to improve living conditions and create new
markets in the Third World by, among other things, helping
restructure debt payments for developing nations; and stabilize the
international monetary system.
   Repairing roads and bridges was given a high priority by the
group as was giving the nation's youth the tools with which to
compete.
   ``We need a longer school year,'' said the commission.
``Japanese students attend school 240 days a year, European
students, on average, 220 days. In the U.S., the average school
year is 180 days. ... The shorter school year clearly places
American students at an educational disadvantage.''

<TEXT>
   The seizure of nearly 5,100 counterfeit designer
watches from two dozen Waikiki vendors is the largest seizure of
its kind in U.S. history, a federal official said.
   U.S. marshals and state sheriff's deputies armed with a federal
warrant raided the shops Friday, said Jim Propotnick, chief deputy
U.S. marshal in Honolulu.
   ``We just hit the mother lode,'' said Propotnick. ``We ended up
making the largest seizure of this type _ wristwatches _ that has
been done.''
   The warrant was requested by watchmakers Rolex, Gucci and Piaget
and was issued secretly Thursday by visiting U.S. District Judge
Laughlin Waters.
   Bill Ellis, a private detective hired by the manufactuers, said
the watches' movements were made in Japan and assembled in Hong
Kong.
   A Rolex watch which normally sells for $11,500 was being sold in
counterfeit version in Waikiki for $70 to $300, or as low as $25
for wholesale orders, Ellis said.

Martin said the designation would help preserve the trail and

   A businessman has set a world record for
the fastest takeoff and climb to 10,000 feet in a private aircraft.
   Dan Hanna took a 23-year-old Lear jet from ``ground zero'' at
Hillsboro Airport to 10,000 feet in one minute and 13 seconds,
knocking five seconds off the old climbing record.
   The flight Friday was witnessed by Moya Lear, widow of Bill
Lear, the airplane's creator. ``It's particularly neat that it was
done with a 23-year-old plane,'' she said. ``It's still the best
plane in the air.''
   Hanna, of Portland, had been scheduled to make the record
attempt Saturday morning, but decided to try it Friday evening
because he felt the heavier and cooler night air would give the
Lear 23 maximum thrust.
   Hank Beaird, who in October 1963 was the first pilot to test the
Lear 23, timed the flight as a representative of the Federation
Aeronautique Internationale.

<HEAD>US Officer: Speedboat Raid Off Saudi Coast A ``Surprise''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-owned supertanker anchored off
Bahrain on Sunday after an Iranian gunboat attack that apparently
caught U.S. military officials in the Persian Gulf by surprise.
   The 258,979-ton Esso Demetia, which flies the British flag, was
about 45 miles off the Saudi Arabian coast when it was ambushed by
two or three armed speedboats just before dusk Saturday.
   Iranian attacks in that area are extremely rare and perhaps
unprecedented, said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The attack ignited several fires aboard the supertanker but
caused no casualties, said gulf-based shipping executives, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The nearest American warship, the guided missile frigate
Halyburton, was 45 miles away, and it would have taken it 1{ hours
to reach the stricken ship.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth, said that by the time
the 3,600-ton frigate met the tanker heading for ``humanitarian
assistance,'' the Esso Demetia was sailing toward Bahrain under its
own power, had the fires under control and did not request help.
   Goforth said U.S. officials would not speculate further on the
attack on the Arab side of the gulf, far from Iran and the
customary haunts of its Revolutionary Guard raiders.
   The supertanker was originally reported to be British-owned, but
Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit on Sunday said it was
U.S.-owned, but it didn't know the firm.
   Senior U.S. officers have said Iran appeared to be testing U.S.
forces following April 18 clashes in which six of Iran's naval
craft were sunk or disabled.
   A U.S. officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the
daylight raid on the Esso Demetia was ``a surprise, not something
anyone was really looking for.''
   ``It's probably supposed to prove they can hit a ship anywhere
they want to,'' he said.
   Available records show that there have been no ship attacks by
Iran in the waters immediately north of Bahrain and east of Saudia
Arabia for several years.
   Iraq and Iran have been fighting since 1980.
   The Esso Demetia attack was one of two raids on ships in four
hours Saturday.
   A Filipino crewman was killed and two others wounded in the
earlier raid on the 11,744-ton West German container ship
Dhaulagiri in the Strait of Hormuz, 350 miles to the southeast.
   Shipping executives said the raids were apparently in
retaliation for Iraqi air strikes on Iran's oil shipping. Iraq
claimed attacks Thursday and Friday but only the first was verified
independently.
   Under recently expanded ``rules of engagement,'' U.S. warships
may respond to requests for help from ships under attack in
international waters, regardless of what flag they fly. American
ships cannot help vessels carrying war-related or contraband cargo.
   Previously, U.S. warships could defend only U.S.-flagged vessels.
   Since the tougher policy went into effect May 3, Iran has
carried out six gunboat attacks, all far enough from patrolling
U.S. warships that they could not intervene.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted a military communique as saying Iraqi jets shot down an
Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter over the gulf Saturday.
   But Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency denied that.

<DATELINE>METROPOLIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space-age cartoon heroes will never
threaten the place of Superman in the heart of this southern
Illinois community, which is celebrating the 50th birthday of its
hometown boy.
   ``He's an adopted son, so to speak,'' Mayor Richard Corzine said
Sunday. ``This is about the 10th annual Superman Celebration. He's
one of the big highlights for the town.''
   Almost 20,000 people gathered over the weekend in Metropolis for
a Superhero birthday party, contests for Superboys, Supergirls and
Superdogs, a mock bank robbery and a Superman baseball tournament,
Corzine said.
   Superman arrived on earth from the planet Krypton in Action
Comics in February 1938. His alter ego was Clark Kent, who worked
at the fictional Daily Planet in the imaginary city of Metropolis.
   The real Metropolis realized during tough economic times in the
early 1970s that it was the only U.S. city with the name of
Superman's home, so it claimed the Man of Steel for its own.
   Billboards tout the adopted son on Route 45 at both ends of
town; the water tower bears a picture of Superman; a statue of him
stands overlooking the main street; the Chamber of Commerce has a
telephone booth where kids can talk to him; and the local newspaper
is named The Metropolis Planet.
   But Superman, or at least the man who's playing him this year,
is not a mild-mannered reporter. He's a service manager for the
local Chevrolet dealer who acknowledges that donning the Superman
outfit is ``a little bit like going outside in your underwear.''
   ``It's the kids that make it worthwhile,'' said Mike Boyd, whose
6-foot-5 inch, 230-pound frame fits the comic book image. Boyd, in
his second year of playing Superman, said Sunday he had signed
about 500 autographs.
   ``A lot of grandmothers are asking for pictures,'' he said.
``They want a picture taken and an autograph to send to grandkids
somewhere.''
   Boyd stepped out of a police-escorted limousine Thursday night
to kick off the celebration in this peaceful Ohio River town of
7,200, which rolled out a 5-foot-by-3-foot cake _ enough to supply
a piece for every celebrant.

   An estimated 150,000 people will
develop AIDS this year, doubling the number of estimated AIDS cases
worldwide since the epidemic began, the World Health Organization
said Sunday.
   ``AIDS is changing the world,'' said Jonathan Mann, director of
the World Health Organization's AIDS program. ``It has become a key
part of the history of our time.''
   He spoke at the opening session of the Fourth International
Conference on AIDS in Stockholm.
   The number of AIDS cases officially reported to the World Health
Organization stood at 75,392 on Jan. 12 and 96,433 as of June 1.
The number of actual cases is estimated to be 200,000, Mann said.
   Although AIDS was not identified until 1981, the origins of the
epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s.
   ``A virus spread across the world, and we didn't even know it
existed,'' Mann said. ``It is _ or should be _ shocking to our
modern pride that such a global expansion could occur without even
being detected.''
   Mann said the five years after 1981 marked a period of
extraordinary discovery, in which the ways in which AIDS spread
were identified, the virus was isolated and an AIDS antibody test
was developed.
   Lars Kallings, chairman of the AIDS conference, said the meeting
allowed scientists to assemble their findings, like the pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle, into a large picture of the AIDS epidemic.
   ``I'm afraid that the picture in its entirety will be
frightening,'' he said.
   Mann described the three distinct patterns of AIDS spread that
make up the worldwide epidemic. Pattern I, he said, is that seen in
the United States and Western Europe, where the disease appeared
first in homosexuals and bisexuals.
   Heterosexual transmission is growing in those areas, the virus
is spreading rapidly among drug abusers through their shared
needles, but blood supplies have now been made safe by screening
for the virus.
   Pattern II, Mann said, characterizes Africa and parts of Latin
America and the Caribbean, where the AIDS spread has been
predominantly among heterosexuals.
   Pattern III refers to the delayed spread of AIDS in Eastern
Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and most countries in Asia
and the Pacific.
   Only 1 percent of the AIDS cases reported to the World Health
Organization come from Pattern III countries, Mann said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins Monday In Pittsburgh For Heidnik Murder
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection was sscheduled to begin
Monday in Pittsburgh for the murder trial of a man charged with
torturing and raping six women, killing two of them, and whose
freezer contained human body parts.
   Gary Heidnik, who is white, is accused of keeping black women
chained in the basement of his row house where, survivors have
testified, he dug screwdrivers into their ears, raped them almost
every day and fed them dog food.
   Six jurors had been chosen in Philadelphia when Common Pleas
Judge Lynne M. Abraham agreed to a defense request to move jury
selection out of town. Those six jurors were dismissed. State Chief
Justice Robert N.C. Nix chose Allegheny County for jury selection;
those chosen will be sequestered for the trial in Philadelphia.
   The judge ordered the change of jury selection because Heidnik,
44, had his lawyer tell the court he didn't believe he would get a
fair shake from Philadelphians.
   Heidnik has a history of mistreating women, and was confined to
maximum-security mental hospital after a 1978 conviction for
kidnapping a retarded person he was charged with raping. Heidnik
told a judge he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
   Defense attorney A. Charles Peruto Jr. has said Heidnik, an Army
veteran with a psychiatric disability, was a subject of Army LSD
experiments in the mid-1960s that aggravated his schizophrenia. The
Army says there is nothing in Heidnik's records showing that, but
Peruto has said he has documents to back up his claim in court.
   Peruto and the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Charles
Gallagher, have been barred by a judge from making any public
comments on the case, at least until the jury is chosen.
   Heidnik, self-styled minister of a church he created and
operated in his home, also turned out to be a financial whiz,
turning $35,000 into a stock portfolio worth more than $500,000 in
10 years.
   Heidnik was arrested in March 1987 after a woman told police she
had escaped from him.
   Police said they found three other women, aged 18 to 24 and
naked from the waist down, chained in the basement, two to a pipe
and the other in a water-filled pit. When they were released they
ran into the street crying ``Free at last.''
   In a freezer were 24 pounds of human limbs with other body parts
in a kitchen refrigerator, police said. The woman who said she
escaped later led detectives to a remote forest area in southern
New Jersey, where they found the body of Debbi Johnson, 23.
   Authorities said Ms. Johnson was electrocuted while standing in
the water-filled pit when the defendant allegedly touched electric
wires to her chains.
   Heidnik also is accused of killing Sandra Lindsay, 24. She died
while hanging for days by one hand shackled to a basement pipe,
authorities said.
   District Attorney Ronald Castille said after Heidnik's arrest
that the reason it took so long to arrest him was that, despite
complaints from neighbors, police had no probable cause.
   ``We can't go walking into people's houses,'' said Police
Inspector James Gallagher. ``We can't just go kicking in doors and
running in.''
   In 1986 Heidnik's estranged wife obtained an order prohibiting
him from ``physically striking, harrassing or threatening'' her.
The document, filed in Family Court, said Heidnik regularly picked
up ``black handicapped women for the purpose of having sex with
them.''
   When neighbors complained in February 1987, a month before his
arrest, about a smell coming from his home Heidnik told police that
a pot of meat had burned.
   ``It's just amazing to me that this could have gone on as long
as it did in the city without someone picking it up,'' said Karen
Kulp, executive director of Women Organized Against Rape.

<HEAD>Dukakis Takes Humorous Jabs At Bush And Himself At Press Roast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated ress Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis responded with a bit of
mimicry when he received a mock congratulatory telegram from
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, at a press roast.
   ``Thank you, Dan,'' said the straight-faced recipient.
   Dan? Yes, Dan, as in CBS anchorman Dan Rather, who had an
infamous interview with Dukakis' Republican opponent, George Bush.
And ``Dan'' as in the name Bush repeatedly used to refer to his
interviewer, Ted Koppel, on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program last
week.
   It was a night of lampoons Saturday as Dukakis was honored by
the Boston Press Photographers Association. The Massachusetts
governor poked fun at his chief rival, selection of a running mate
and even himself.
   Dukakis told the gathering he took a break that afternoon to go
``to a Harvard boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow,'' a
tounge-in-cheek jibe at Bush's characterization of Dukakis as an
elitist.
   He joked about picking a vice president, pointing a finger down
the head table at Steve Nelson, a former linebacker for the New
England Patriots football team.
   ``He knows something about defense and I'm interested in
conventional defense,'' Dukakis told his receptive _ and laughing _
audience. ``I've been thinking about Nelson.''
   The unusually festive Dukakis, who rarely tries to be funny,
accepted the barbs as well as dishing them out.
   Master of ceremonies Bob Warren presented him with a cardboard
presidential seal with a likeness of a cod in place of the bald
eagle.
   He laughed again when another seal was attached to the podium;
the sign said the official seal of ``The Next President of the
United States.''
   And he roared when Warren presented him with catalogs and a
shopping bag from one of Washington's pricier shops, telling
Dukakis they were for his wife, Kitty, whose penchant for finer
clothing contrasts sharply with her husband's love of
bargain-basement suits.
   ``We know you don't shop,'' said Warren.
   The host told Dukakis he had the Boston press to thank for
helping him develop ``that fine-tuned media style the rest of the
nation now finds so riveting and charasmatic.''
   For the sake of fairness, Warren noted Bush's attacks on
Dukakis' suburban upbringing and fired back:
   ``Kennebunkport isn't exactly tent city, you know,'' a reference
to the vice president's sprawling oceanside summer compound in
Maine.

<TEXT>
   Debbie Buchanan was working her regular
shift as a bartender at the Snick-Snack Tap when her dream turned
to reality _ she won a piece of a $35 million lottery jackpot, the
second largest in state history.
   ``I was just sitting at the bar, comparing my tickets against
the number, when I said, `I got three, I got four, I got, five, I
got six,''' Ms. Buchanan, 28, said after the Saturday night Lotto
drawing.
   Earlier in the day, Ms. Buchanan had bought $10 worth of Lotto
tickets along with Tony Godinez, 23, her boyfriend's brother, in
this west Chicago suburb.
   Godinez, a laid-off construction worker and father of two, said
Sunday that it didn't take long for news of his good fortune to get
around.
   ``I've had a lot of phone calls. They say, `Hey, Tony, you
remember me from school, don't you?' I say, `No, goodbye.'''
   The ticket purchased by Ms. Buchanan and Godinez was one of
three winning tickets in the Lotto drawing, which had a guaranteed
grand prize for a single winner of $35 million, paid in the form of
an annuity over 20 years.
   Since the grand prize money will be divided among three winners,
officials won't know until Monday how large an annuity each third
of the jackpot will buy, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem.
   They also won't be able to confirm the winners until Monday,
each of whom faced odds of 12.9 million-to-1 in picking the six
winning numbers, Ms. Rem said.
   The other winning tickets _ which matched the numbers 2, 4, 9,
31, 42 and 45 _ were bought in the south Chicago suburb of Steger
and in Rockford, she said.
   The $35 million Illinois jackpot is second only to the $40
million Lotto jackpot won by Mike Wittkowski on Sept. 1, 1984.
   Ms. Buchanan said Sunday she had not had time to think about
what she would do with her winnings, other than ``get my mom a
(new) house.'' The daughter is single, lives at home with her
mother and two brothers, and has worked at the Snick-Snack for
about two years.
   ``This bar is one big family. We all know each other, so when we
found out that me and Tony had won, it was like the whole family
had won,'' she said.
   ``I haven't been able to sit down and think about what I'm going
to do with the money,'' Godinez said.
   As for the reaction of his brother, Armando Godinez, whom Ms.
Buchanan has been seeing, Tony Godinez quipped, ``What else is he
going to say but, `Let's get married?' If he's smart, that's what
he'll say.''
   Kidding aside, Tony Godinez said he won't have to work any more
part-time construction jobs ``to put food on the table'' for his
wife and youngsters, Eric, 3, and Jacqueline, 16 months.
   ``We joke a little, we pray to God a little, and we thank him
for what he's given us,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms produced violent weather, but also brought
much-needed rain, over the drought-stricken northern Plains on
Sunday. There were record high temperatures in Michigan and record
lows in the South.
   Thunderstorms developed along a cold front and extended from
eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota across central
South Dakota.
   Thunderstorms produced wind gusts to 60 mph at Mobridge, S.D.,
and gusts to 62 mph at Jamestown, N.D. High wind downed a tree and
damaged a roof at Tappen, N.D., the National Weather Service said.
   Mobridge got 1.47 inches of rain during the six hours up to 2
p.m. EDT and Jamestown got 0.80 of an inch.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms continued across extreme
southern Florida and isolated showers were over the rest of the
Gulf Coast. Miami got 1.62 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2
p.m.
   A few showers spread over the Northwest.
   Ahead of the cold front, highs were in the 80s and lower 90s
across much of the nation east of the Rockies. In northern
Michigan, Marquette hit a record 88 and Alpena hit a record 91.
   But the South had another day of record and record-tying lows,
including 40 at Asheville, N.C., tie; 39 at Batesville, Ark., tie;
45 at Bristol, Tenn.; 44 at Calico Rock, Ark.; 51 at Chattanooga,
Tenn., tie; 50 at El Dorado, Ark.; 53 at Huntsville, Ala.; 52 at
Jackson, Miss., tie; 47 at Knoxville, Tenn., tie; 48 at Mena, Ark.,
tie; 50 at Meridian, Miss.; 54 at Monroe, La.; 50 at Paducah, Ky.,
tie; 48 at Pinson, Ala., tie; and 53 at Shreveport, La.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Helena, Mont., to 95 at Tucson, Ariz. The low for the
day was 30 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern and central Rockies to the northwestern half of
Minnesota, and across the southern half of Florida. Widely
scattered showers were forecast over northern Maine.
   Highs remaining below 80 were predicted from the coast of
Washington through Montana and Wyoming into western sections of the
Dakotas, including highs only in the 60s and upper 50s in Montana
and northwestern Wyoming; in the upper 70s in northern Maine; in
the 90s or above 100 in the valleys and deserts of the Southwest;
and mostly be in the 80s and low 90s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Convicted rapist Lawrence Singleton, who
hacked off the arms of his teen-age victim, apparently has chosen
to settle in the Tampa area but may have violated a state law,
authorities say.
   Free after parole in California, Singleton was issued his
driver's license last week and listed a permanent address at a home
in northwest Hillsborough County, said sheriff's Col. Cal Henderson.
   ``I don't know anything about it,'' the home's owner told The
Tampa Tribune Sunday. The newspaper did not identify the homeowner
and officials do not know if he is related to Singleton.
   Local officials of the state Department of Highway Safety and
Motor Vehicles alerted the sheriff's office that Singleton received
a driver's license, Henderson said.
   Authorities say Singleton appears to have violated a state law
that requires felons to register with the local sheriff or the
state Department of Law Enforcement within 48 hours of arrival in a
county.
   Two detectives have been assigned to locate Singleton and cite
him for failing to register, Henderson said.
   Singleton, who was reared in Tampa, has been trailed by
controversy since his release from prison.
   Outraged Californians mounted campaigns when their communites
were mentioned as possible homes during his yearlong parole. He
spent weeks being shuttled among apartments and motels along the
California coast and wound up in a mobile home on the grounds of
San Quentin Prison until the parole expired.
   The 60-year-old former merchant seaman can travel as he pleases
after serving eight years of a 14-year sentence and the year's
probation.
   His parole ended in April and days later he came to Florida to
visit his sister's home.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker and
chopping her arms off. He left her for dead along a roadside in
1978, but she recovered and moved to a new home in the Pacific
Northwest.

<TEXT>
   The estate of a cancer victim who worked
around asbestos is suing a tobacco company, charging that it failed
to warn people the two substances are a dangerous combination.
   The case of John Ray Gunsalus vs. American Tobacco Co. is
believed to be the first to come to trial linking tobacco and
asbestos, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday.
   Gunsalus, who smoked two packs of Pall Malls daily, worked at
shipyard jobs that left him covered with asbestos, jurors were told
last week. He died last year at age 55 after smoking since age 11.
   In 1985, the surgeon general reported that people who work near
asbestos are five times as likely to get lung cancer as people who
do not come in contact with the substance. Smokers are 10 times
more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers. But people who
work near asbestos and smoke are 50 times more likely to get cancer
than people who do neither, according to the report.
   Attorney Thomas F. Johnson, who is representing Gunsalus'
estate, told the eight-member jury during opening arguments Tuesday
that Gunsalus should have been told of the dangerous combination of
asbestos and cigarettes.
   The tobacco company should have issued special warnings about
the added dangers of smoking for people who work around asbestos,
according to the estate, which contends that Gunsalus never knew of
the danger.
   The estate originally sued about 12 asbestos companies, along
with American Tobacco, the maker of Pall Malls. Claims against nine
asbestos companies were dismissed and three were settled before the
trial began, according to court records.
   Lawyers would not discuss the terms of the settlements and U.S.
District Judge Norma L. Shapiro has ordered that jurors not be told
about the settlements.
   American Tobacco contends that it was Gunsalus' choice to smoke,
despite warnings from friends and relatives that cigarettes were
``cancer sticks.''
   ``He is the type of person on whom a warning would have made no
difference whatsoever,'' said Edward F. Mannino, the tobacco
company's attorney, in his opening arguments.
   Mannino argued that the cancer that killed Gunsalus was a rare
type not statistically related to cigarette smoking.
   The only period for which cigarette makers can be held liable,
according to federal court appeals decisions, is prior to 1966.
That year, health warnings began to be placed on cigarette packs.
   Gunsalus was diagnosed with cancer of the lung, liver and head
in 1985.
   Monday will be the first anniversary of Gunsalus' death at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia. His death
certificate listed the cause of death as a brain tumor, caused by
lung cancer, which led to a fatal drop in blood pressure.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential hopeful George
Bush, in an effort to broaden his support among blacks, on Sunday
urged the use of federal aid to assist minority businesses.
   ``I support strongly increased minority development efforts by
the federal government: We must bring black Americans and other
minorities into the free enterprise system, as we must into the
government,'' Bush said as he delivered the commencement address at
predominantly black Central State University.
   The vice president's pledge is a break with the Reagan
administration, which has opposed state and local programs that set
aside a portion of contracts for members of a particular race.
   The set-asides have been used by federal, state and local
governments as a way to remedy past racial discrimination against
minority businessmen.
   In his speech, Bush called for a ``a positive civil rights
agenda, one that protects the civil rights of every American,'' but
he said the policy must go beyond that to ``knock down the walls of
indifference and other barriers that result in economic exclusion.''
   The vice president told the 275 Central State graduates they
made it thrugh college despite ``poverty, broken homes, inadequate
schools, and the social challenges or threat of drugs and
violence.''
   He urged them to continue taking risks and become among those
Americans who create one million businesses a year.
   ``Risk-taking is the heartbeat of the American dream,'' he said,
and the resulting economic growth lets those just entering the job
market ``get a piece of the pie without taking it away from someone
who's already there.''
   Bush, responding to questions from reporters, said he would work
to ``broaden the base of our party, talk on the issues that I think
transcend black, white, American issues that are out there and are
going to appeal.''
   Bush, who celebrated his 64th birthday on Sunday, was awarded an
honorary Doctor of Laws degree. The award was announced last year,
but Bush was unable to receive until Sunday, said Ed Chamness, a
spokesman for the university.
   In honor of the vice president's birthday, a reporter presented
Bush with a t-shirt bearing a photo of embattled Attorney General
Edwin Meese III and the inscription, ``What, Me Worry?''
   But the vice president refused to show the shirt to reporters
during a tour of the neighboring National Afro-American museum
prior to the speech.
   Bush met privately with about 20 local dignitaries at the museum
and was presented with two paintings by Willis Bing Davis, a
Central State professor whose paintings are on display.
   Bush later flew to to Danville, Va., where he campaigned for
Republican congressional candidate Linda Arey.

<HEAD>White House Tennis Tourney Benefits Anti-Drug Cause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The score got mangled at times and George
Shultz's serve appeared to suffer from jet lag, but the action on
the White House tennis court Sunday was all for a good cause.
   Celebrities, tennis pros and administration officials gathered
for the annual White House tennis tournament to raise funds for
Nancy Reagan's anti-drug abuse fund.
   President Reagan and the first lady joined a crowd of corporate
sponsors and guests on the court, watching tennis stars Tracy
Austin, Vince Van Patten Jimmy Arias and Dennis Ralston compete in
a match that had no winners _ local sportscaster and umpire Glenn
Brenner got the numbers mixed up.
   The first couple also watched as Secretary of State Shultz and
GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf went down in defeat at the hands of
Treasury Secretary James Baker III and Wilhelm Wachtmeister, the
ambassador of Sweden.
   It was the fourth such tennis tournament, and it raised some
$500,000 for the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Fund.
   At the end of the tournament, Mrs. Reagan presented $50,000
checks to two anti-drug abuse groups, the Target Interactive
Project of Kansas City, Mo., and Wally's Club and Frontline Foster
Grandparents Program of Nashville, Tenn.
   ``Because of their work, the lives of many parents and children
will be much brighter, and America will be an even better place to
live,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

<HEAD>Police Make More Than 1,400 Arrests, Once-Plagued Suburb Lauded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An anti-gang police task force code-named
``The Hammer'' dropped down on the city's streets over the weekend,
making nearly 1,400 arrests and recovering drugs and firearms.
   Meanwhile, the suburban city of Paramount was cited by the
Washington-based National Civic League as one of 10 ``All-American
Cities'' for its efforts to defeat street gangs.
   The police sweep conducted Friday and Saturday nights throughout
the city resulted in issuance of hundreds of misdemeanor warrants,
seizures of small quantities of drugs and impoundment of several
automobiles, authorities said..
   Officers also gathered intelligence, filling out hundreds of
field identifications forms of suspected and known gang members for
future reference.
   The actions are major skirmishes in what Police Chief Daryl
Gates calls a war on ``the rotten little cowards,'' and followed
the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen
20 percent this year.
   The report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city this year
through the end of May, compared to 80 in the same period a year
ago.
   In all of Los Angeles County there have been 138 gang-related
killings this year. In 1987, gang slayings totaled 387 countywide.
   Authorities estimate there are as many as 70,000 gang members in
the city and Los Angeles County.
   Along with confiscations of rock or crack cocaine and the
hallucinogenic drug PCP, several weapons were confiscated,
including an AK-47 assault rifle, said Lt. Jim Tatreau.
   The city of Paramount, southeast of Los Angeles, was named
Saturday by the National Civic League.
   The citation noted that earlier, this decade, the suburb was
faced with urban problems and a high crime rate that put it on a
list of 14 cities around the country labeled ``disaster areas.''
   But since then, 2,900 youths have participated in an
``Alternative To Gang Membership'' program in six years, and only
15 were later identified by authorities as gang members.
   About 1,700 properties have been cleaned up by more than 980
volunteers who donated more than 4,800 hours of labor, while an
active civilian ``Neighborhood Watch'' program freed county
sheriff's deputies for more patrol duties.

<HEAD>Genscher Welcomes Soviet Arms Reduction Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher welcomes a Soviet suggestion on a conventional arms treaty
with the West but only as a starting point for future negotiations,
Genscher's spokesman said Sunday.
   ``This will have to be looked at very closely, but it does show
a new thinking in the Soviet Union,'' spokesman Juergen Chrobog
told The Associated Press.
   He was referring to remarks by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze last week in New York indicating the Warsaw Pact
alliance was ready to make cuts in its conventional forces that
would not have to be matched equally by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   At a conference on East-West security Saturday in Potsdam, East
Germany, Genscher said he greeted the apparent change in the
Kremlin's position.
   ``This speech in New York (by Shevardnadze) is welcomed because
now it has been clearly stated that everywhere there is an (Warsaw
Pact) advantage, asymmetrical cuts will have to be made,'' Genscher
said at the three-day conference that ended Saturday.
   ``This is very important for us in view of the superiority by
the Eastern side in large-scale equipment (such as tanks),'' he
added.
   Earlier in the Potsdam conference, other Soviet officials said
the Warsaw Pact was ready to make asymmetrical cuts in its tank
force, but they linked such reductions with elimination of NATO's
advantages in fighter aircraft and attack helicopters.
   Chrobog said Genscher was pleased with the Soviet statements on
conventional arms ``but these are matters which we have to analyze
further'' along with West Germany's NATO allies.
   During the Potsdam conference the Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Ivan Aboymov, outlined the latest Soviet proposals
calling for a three-stage reduction of conventional forces in
Europe.
   He said the first stage would be an elimination of force
imbalances between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, followed by a
reduction of 500,000 troops on each side and then restructuring the
remaining forces to give them a defensive rather than offensive
capability.

   A woman trapped in the collapse of a cave
from which two male companions escaped was found dead early Sunday,
and a fire official said dry weather may have contributed to the
collapse.
   Crews using shovels and backhoes found the body of Virginia
Green, 23, of Hugo, in the rubble of the cave in a sandstone cliff
near the Mississippi River on the city's southeast side.
   Recent dry weather may have contributed to Saturday night's
accident in Battle Creek Park, said District Fire Chief Warren
Cook, referring to the fine, powdery rubble of disintegrated
sandstone.
   Mike Bryant, 21, of St. Paul, said the three were sitting in the
cave listening to a tape player when the accident occurred.
   ``I was in the mouth of the cave. Sand started coming, and I
heard rumbling and started running,'' Bryant said from St.
Paul-Ramsey Medical Center. ``Something hit me in the head. My legs
were completely buried under sand and rock.''
   He said Green was deeper in the cave but that he was not sure
why she didn't run out.
   Bryant suffered an ankle injury. Kevin Sederstrom, 22, of St.
Paul, said he escaped without injury.

<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Product directions often seem simple.
``Press firmly'' is a typical instruction. But how firmly?
   Design engineers at Tufts University are researching ways to
make such orders more specific.
   They began after learning that owners of homes with a certain
kind of gas valve were asked to test them by pressing a knob firmly
without forcing it; with no more than those directions, the owners
were expected to determine whether their valves were defective and
possibly dangerous.
   ``The goal of the research is the ability to craft phrases that
will produce well-defined physical responses,'' said Professor John
G. Kreifeldt.
   A graduate student in design engineering at Tufts, Kodali V.N.
Rao, developed an experiment to see if product directions could be
made more simple.
   ``From nail polish to computers, cameras to hair sprays and
toasters to tanks, the designer needs to be well-informed about the
consequences resulting from use or misuse of the product,'' said
Rao. ``As designers, we have to decide that a switch should work
with a certain amount of force.''
   But how does one go about communicating that, he wondered.
   In his research, he asked about 240 people to squeeze a device
attached to a meter, either gently or hard.
   The results varied considerably. The instruction ``firm''
covered a range of two kilograms to 32 kilograms of force.
   The project's most surprising result: when the instructions were
changed to ``squeeze not very hard and not too gently,'' the test
participants were remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of the
participants applied 12.9 to 14.6 kilograms of force.
   Rao said that the word ``not'' in instructions causes people to
be more cautious about how much pressure they exert.
   ``Force is a perceivable thing that people can use through
experience,'' said Rao. ``One thing is sure: one-word instructions
don't convey enough information. If you say `Do this,' people tend
to get carried away by presuppositions, so it is important to give
users parameters.''

   A rolling earthquake shook this inland
area of Southern California on Sunday, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injury, authorities said.
   The quake also was felt in the cities of San Bernardino, Fontana
and Riverside, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``We thought someone had hit the building. We only got about two
or three calls on it,'' said dispatcher Teresa Paniagua at the
Fontana Police Department. None of the callers reported injuries or
damage, she said.
   The quake struck about 2:22 p.m. PDT, was centered about five
miles east-southeast of Ontario, and measured 3.4 on the Richter
scale, said Hall Daily, a spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The temblor was the second widely felt quake to hit Southern
California since Friday, when a shaker measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale hit 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles and was felt in much of
central and southern California.
   Daily said initial data indicated it was unlikely the Sunday
quake was related to the one which struck Friday.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area.

   Premier Karoly Grosz said in an

   ``I don't know what I will do with it upon returning home,'' he

   Grosz, who also is Hungarian Communist Party chief, said he will
visit Moscow at Mikhail Gorbachev's invitation and that his talks
with the Soviet leader will cover energy, raw material and
technology issues.
   Grosz made an indirect comment about a possible visit to
Romania, but gave no date or specifics and did not mention the
strained relations between the two Warsaw Pact allies and neighbors.
   Their relations have deteriorated with Hungary claiming that
Romania is depriving the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania
of their ethnic and cultural rights. Romania has rejected the
accusations.
   Hungary also has also protested the planned elimination by the
year 2000 of more than 7,000 Romanian villages, including thousands
inhabited mainly by members of the Hungarian minority.

   As many as 60 children may have eluded
social workers who rounded up and removed residents of a boarding
home under investigation for abuse, the state Welfare Department
chief said Sunday.
   But state Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain said he was
unsure how many children may have been left behind when students
from the Bethel Home for Children near Lucedale were removed Friday
by the workers armed with a court order.
   ``There are still a whole lot of kids out there wandering around
somewhere that were released through a totally inappropriate
manner,'' Brittain said at a Sunday news conference.
   He said 66 children had been taken into custody, including a
runaway brought to a state mental institution, early Sunday morning.
   The children were rounded up near the campus of the 28-acre
home, at restaurants and along roadways.
   Even as welfare workers continued trying to reunite some of the
youngsters with their familes, the Rev. Herman Fountain, the home's
operator, said he was sheltering four or five youngsters who fled
the home before the workers arrived.
   ``I've still got a few soldiers left, and I'm trying to work
back to what it was before,'' said Fountain, 38, who established
the fundamentalist Christian home 10 years ago as what he calls a
last refuge for troubled kids.
   Fountain says he is a former heroin addict, and his experiences
on the streets of New York City qualify him to work with such
children.
   Fountain's comments drew a tight-lipped response from the judge
who ordered the Welfare Department to remove children from the home
that has come under criticism intermittently since 1980.
   ``I'll deal with it, but I'll deal with it Monday,'' Chancery
Judge Robert Oswald said in a telephone interview from his home.
   A court hearing is set for Monday morning in Lucedale to decide
where the children taken from Bethel will be placed.
   Brittain said ``between 10 and 15'' children already had been
released to their parents.
   The commissioner said he was satisfied with the state's handling
of the situation and was not worried that some parents might want
to sue the state for removing the children.
   Oswald ruled Friday that children at Bethel _ who range in age
from 10 to 17 and are mostly from outside Mississippi _ were
subjected ``to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention
amounting to imprisonment.'' He ordered their immediate removal.
   Brittain, who supervised the children's removal from the home,
said Saturday that medical examinations of some children showed
excessive use of corporal punishment.
   As for the children who have returned to Bethel since Friday,
Brittain said, ``We'll work with the court on that and follow the
court's direction on that.''
   There have been estimates that 120 to 160 children were at the
home.
   Fountain refused to provide the court a list with names and
addresses of the children and their parents.
   Fountain vowed Saturday in a telephone interview from Lucedale
to continue to keep open Bethel's doors and said he had taken in
another resident, a teen-age boy, despite the judge's Friday order.
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't know how that court order
reads,'' he said.
   Charges that he enslaved and beat children are half-truths,
Fountain said. The children were brought to him precisely because
they needed strong discipline and hard work to set them on a
spiritual path.
   ``The parents have lost control. Kids today are such
manipulators. Such cons. Especially a child from a divorce. They've
learned how to manipulate their parents,'' the independent Baptist
minister said.
   ``The children are here mainly for runaways, stealing,
homosexuality. We have little girls who were whores,'' he said.
``They need a little discipline, a little bit of hard work. We give
them the Bible, not that trash they read, not rock 'n' roll. They
are going to do work when they are here.''
   Fountain believes the state welfare department is in conspiracy
against him, a conspiracy that runs so deep, those involved are
unaware. The conspiracy is based on the principles of humanism, an
anathema to his own fundamentalist beliefs and his advocacy of
separation between church and state, he claims.
   The conspiracy's aim, he said, is to set up licensing laws for
church-run homes, something he insists he will never submit to.

<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis on
Sunday called President Reagan's anti-drug programs ``chaos'' and
promised the nation's mayors a tough program to curb drug use and
trafficking that would include the possible use of military force.
   The Massachusetts governor, who has enough delegates to secure
the Democratic presidential nomination, called for stronger drug
laws and stringent sentencing guidelines, but stopped short of
endorsing capital punishment for major dealers, which apparent
Republican nominee George Bush supports.
   ``My friends, we can win the war against drugs,'' Dukakis said
in a speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, where he picked up
endorsements from more than 500 Democratic mayors.
   ``But we have to recognize that it is war _ a war of wills, a
war of values, a war of confidence and courage and strength,'' he
said in his speech to the mayors.
   Dukakis also reiterated his pledge to raise taxes only as a last
resort, and told the mayors he welcomed their suggestions on
potential running mates. ``A lot of people are going to be
considered,'' he told reporters prior to the speech.
   Dukakis touted a Massachusetts program that brings drug
education to students and teachers and involves police and local
celebrities, promising to establish a similar national program if
elected.
   He said a national program should have the goal of ridding the
nation's schools of drugs by the 1990s and guaranteeing immediate
treatment for addicts.
   ``Now some may say that goal is too ambitious, that we'll never
make it,'' Dukakis said. ``But if we don't set ambitious goals for
our young people and for our nation, how are we ever going to win
this war?''
   In a scathing indictment of Reagan's anti-drug effort, Dukakis
said the president has failed to back up his tough rhetoric and has
undermined the war on drugs by cutting the Coast Guard budget, by
slashing federal aid to state and local police, by failing to
appoint a federal drug Czar, and by dealing with suspected drug
runners _ particularly Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``What we have today is chaos,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got to
back up what we say with what we do.''
   Dukakis promised the mayors to beef up federal law enforcement
staffs and to increase federal aid to state and local police,
although he did not suggest a specific dollar amount when asked by
reporters.
   He also said, ``We've got to move the war against narcotics from
the bottom to the top of our foreign policy agenda.''
   Dukakis said that if elected he would issue an executive order
prohibiting the payment of CIA or other government funds to
suspected drug dealers.
   ``Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug
peddler who is poisoning our society and killing are children,''
Dukakis said.
   He also said he would use increased amounts of U.S. foreign aid
for crop eradication and other drug interdiction efforts, including
the protection of politicians, police and judges in drug-producing
countries whose lives are threatened by drug kingpins.
   The military should be prepared to assist in such efforts, said
Dukakis, who again did not provide specific dollar figures on the
foreign aid proposal.
   ``It will take tough, sustained and unrelenting enforcement, on
the ground, in the air and at sea _ at home and abroad,'' Dukakis
said. ``Enforcement which uses the military where appropriate and
necessary.''
   He also chided Reagan for not working with Latin American
leaders to oust Noriega, saying such cooperation was vital to
stopping the flow of cocaine and marijuana into the United States.
   After his speech, Dukakis met with Democratic mayors and later
was holding a private session with a smaller group of black mayors.
   He was returning to Boston Sunday night and was to meet Monday
with congressional leaders and law enforcement officials from
several states to discuss drug issues.

   Jessica McClure, whose three-day ordeal
at the bottom of an abandoned well captured international
attention, gave a wrestler a kiss that ``knocked him dead'' during
matches to raise funds for a boy with heart and lung problems.
   A crowd of about 500 cheered Saturday night as Jessica, 2, got
in one corner of a wrestling ring while 5-year-old Brennan Bolin,
who doctors said needs a heart-lung transplant, went to another
corner.
   Then a ``match'' was announced between wrestler Kevin Von Erich
and ``America's Sweetheart, Jessica McClure,'' and the crowd was
told it would see how Jessica could knock out the wrestling champ.
   The toddler kissed Von Erich, and he staggered and fell to the
mat.
   Jessica's appearance was to help raise medical expenses for
Brennan, who lives in Lancaster, a Dallas suburb.
   Money raised at the event had not been totaled Sunday, but Mayor
Walter Arnold estimated it brought the total raised for Brennan to
$55,000. ``We still need more money,'' he added, because surgery is
expected to cost about $650,000, with all but $125,000 covered by
insurance.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally In Scotland for Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen thousand people rallied Sunday
in support of Nelson Mandela, one day after the jailed black South
African leader's birthday was celebrated with a huge pop music
concert London.
   ``Our time has come,'' the Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid
activist, told the crowd at a Glasgow park.
   ``They have thrown us in prison, murdered us, assaulted us and
tried to intimidate us into silence so that you would forget,'' the
mixed-race church leader said to a standing ovation.
   The rally was the second part of the ``Freedom at 70 Campaign''
marking Mandela's 70th birthday July 18.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, has been
jailed in South Africa for 25 years. He was convicted in 1964 on
charges of sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government and
sentenced to life in prison.
   The ANC, outlawed in South Africa, is the largest black
guerrilla group fighting to overthrow that country's
white-dominated government of President P.W. Botha and dismantle
the system of apartheid.
   On Saturday, more than 70,000 fans jammed London's Wembley
Stadium for a 10-hour rock concert by top international pop stars,
whose music was interspersed with denunciations of apartheid, South
Africa's system of racial separation.
   It was the biggest charity rock concert since the 1985 ``Live
Aid'' famine-relief extravaganza. Because of its political message,
the British Broadcasting Corp. came under heavy criticism for
broadcasting the entire event. But the BBC said it regarded the
concert as a musical, not a political, program.
   Modeled on Live Aid's ``global jukebox'' to aid starving
Africans, the concert was beamed by radio and television to an
estimated 750 million people in 60 countries, including the United
States and the Soviet Union, organizers said.
   Among the 40 or so performers were Sting, George Michael,
Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, Joe Cocker, Whitney Houston, Phil
Collins, the Eurythmics, the Bee Gees, Wet Wet Wet and Dire Straits.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Hooligans Abroad: Britain Tries To Salvage Its Overseas Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The image of the British traveler, once a model of
courtesy and reserve, has apparently been given a black eye by a
new breed of bad-mannered Britons.
   So the government, worried about its hooligans abroad, has
launched a television advertising campaign aimed at salvaging the
stiff-upper-lip image of its citizens overseas.
   ``It is a fact that over the years, particularly where the
British are going in vast numbers on holidays, there are
problems,'' a Foreign Office spokesman explained Sunday.
   Those problems include Britons who wind up in trouble with the
local law as well as crimes committed against British tourists.
   ``Those figures have gone up enormously,'' the spokesman said
anonymously, in keeping with British practice.
   British sports fans following their teams to games on the
Continent have run into serious trouble with police. Because of
violence at soccer games, British soccer clubs have been barred
from European Cup competition since 1985.
   The Foreign Office decided to launch the summer advertising
campaign in two weeks to back up its leaflet called ``Get It Right
Before You Go.''
   It will urge travelers to take out proper insurance and remind
them to abide by the laws of their host country during their stay.
   Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar goes to Spain this week to
inspect arrangements being made to handle the annual flood of
British tourists to the Mediterranean beach resorts.

   An examination of dozens of untended
bodies found in a funeral home turned up at least one that dates
back to 1978, authorities said.
   The medical examiners office said Saturday that it had
identified 49 of 70 sets of remains discovered at the Howell
Morning Glory Chapel, which had the city contract for handling the
bodies of indigents. But Chief Medical Examiner Peter Lipkovic said
some may never be identified.
   ``There will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not
be able to identify them. One doesn't have a head or legs, so even
if we had a dental chart, what could we do?'' he said.
   The first two bodies were found during a routine state
inspection, and 42 more were found during last week, many of them
stacked in a closet, a police officer said. In addition, 26 boxes
containing cremated ashes were discovered.
   Bodies were identified through death certificates noting
Howell's funeral home, legible hospital bracelets, medical
examiner's toe tags, or medical appliances such as hip pins, said
Lipkovic.
   The oldest remains were identified through a 1978 death
certificate, Lipkovic said.
   Officials have not released the names of those identified and
have not contacted family members.
   The state Department of Professional Regulation suspended owner
Lewis Howell's license last week.
   Howell has said the bodies were being held because of procedural
problems with paperwork, not because of money problems.
   Howell was called Sunday for additional comment, but could not
be reached.
   Officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard
behind the funeral home, but Lipkovic doubts any bodies will be
found. ``With a free graveyard nearby, that wouldn't make sense,''
he said, referring to Hillside Cemetery, the city's burial grounds
for indigents.

   About 2,000 people rallied Sunday outside
the Gdansk apartment of Solidarity founder Lech Walesz and shouted
anti-government slogans.
   In Warsaw, police detained two men who were tossing leaflets and
demanding the release of jailed draft resisters, opposition
spokesman Marek Kosakowski reported.
   He said Gwido Zlatkes and Tomasz Gleb of the banned Freedom and
Peace organization climbed scaffolding on a main street near the
Royal Castle and threw some 1,500 leaflets to the crowd below.
   Kosakowski said many in the crowd, which he estimated to number
about 1,000, hooted and jeered police who tried to remove the two
from the scaffold.
   Zlatkes and Gleb climbed down about five minutes later and were
immediatelsy detained, according to Kosakowski.
   He said the leaflets listed 16 people as being imprisoned for
refusing mandatory military service, including Slawomir Dutkiewicz,
24. Freedom and Peace has said Dutkiewicz has been on a hunger
strike since being jailed seven months ago and is being force-fed
in prison.
   Walesa said in a telephone interview he was surprised by the
rally that developed after an outdoor Mass near his apartment in
the Baltic port city.
   The demonstrators marched to his apartment building shouting
``We want Lech, not Wojciech!'' and ``No freedom without
Solidarity!''
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski is the communist government's premier.
   Walesa said in the interview that he had not attended the Mass
and decided to address the crowd when many people shouted they
would boycott elections June 19 for municipal and provincial
councils.
   ``I said that the generals should know that was what people are
really thinking. I said that because we are not being noticed, we
should prepare ourselves for August in order to lead Poland into a
real road of reforms,'' Walesa said in the interview.
   Solidarity was chartered by the government as the first free
trade union in the Soviet bloc following nationwide strikes in
August 1981. It was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently
outlawed.
   Walesa joined in a strike May 2-10 at the Lenin shipyard in
Gdansk, where he works as an electrician.
   The strike ended without a settlement and Walesa said later that
unless authorities initiate a dialogue with Solidarity, Poland can
expect more strikes, probably in August.

   Terry Waite's family expressed optimism Sunday
that the church envoy will be freed by his Lebanese captors despite
a book claiming Oliver North planned to use him in a death plot
against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Libya reacted to the report by saying it revealed the ``real
ugly face'' of the Reagan administration and it accused the United
States of official terrorism.
   David Waite, brother of the Anglican Church envoy, called the
allegations in the book ``mischievous.''
   But he added: ``We are very optimistic about the eventual
outcome of Terry's situation. The big question is the timing of it.
   ``We are probably now in the most positive era we have ever been
in, as far as this situation is concerned. ... We just have to wait
and pray, as we have been doing all along, that we will eventually
see a good outcome.''
   The book, ``Best Laid Plans, The Inside Story of America's War
Against Terrorism,'' was written by David Martin, Pentagon
correspondent for CBS, and John Walcott, national security
correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.
   An excerpt printed in U.S. News & World Report alleged that
North, a former U.S. National Security Council aide, planned to ask
Terry Waite to go to Tripoli to meet Gadhafi in 1986 to seek help
in freeing hostages in Lebanon.
   The article alleged that Waite's visit would be timed to ensure
that Gadhafi was in his compound when the Americans launched their
bombing raid on the Libyan capital April 15, 1986. According to the
book, the idea was to increase the chances of Gadhafi being killed
in the raid.
   Libya's official Jana news agency, in a dispatch monitored in
London, said, ``The plot revealed today and the ones before it
which included American official terrorism and subversion represent
the style of smugglers and heads of gangsters.''
   It added: ``Every day the U.S. administration reveals its real
ugly face showing that America has become the official center of
the administration of terrorism and subversive plots, assassination
and aggression against other peoples in a manner never seen before
in contemporary political history.''
   The Reagan administration ordered the bombings of Tripoli and
Benghazi after accusing Gadhafi of supporting international
terrorism.
   David Waite said: ``I think it is mischievous of people to put
things like this (the alleged North plot) into books just to add a
bit of spice to them.
   ``They are talking about a person (Terry Waite) who is not in a
position at the moment to defend himself,'' he added.
   Waite said his brother always ``made it very clear he was not in
any way associated with anything underhand or sinister.
   ``He was and still is a humanitarian working for the Archbishop
of Canterbury as an envoy on properly humanitarian grounds.''
   Gadhafi was apparently unharmed in the bombing, although there
were rumors that the attack left him confused and disoriented.
Libyan officials reported that his 15-month old adopted daughter
was killed and two young sons were wounded.
   Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut in January 1987 while on a
mission to help win the release of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are being
held captive by Islamic extremists in Lebanon. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, has retired from the
military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from the
diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels from U.S. arms sales
to Iran. He was fired from his NSC job in November 1986, when the
diversion became public.

   A crowd of about 40 people, most of them
Irish-American, tossed copies of Golf Digest into Boston Harbor on
Sunday in a ``Tee party'' to protest slurs against the Irish
contained in a Digest article.
   The demonstration against the article, ``The Role of the Irish
at The Country Club,'' took place about seven miles from The
Country Club, site of the 1988 U.S. Open golf championship this
week.
   The article, by British writer Peter Dobereiner, enraged
Irish-Americans, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and Cardinal Bernard
Law, among others, for its depiction of Irish as lazy drunkards.
   The furor was intensified when The Boston Sunday Globe reprinted
the piece as an advertising supplement in some 250,000 copies of
the paper. When the controversy erupted late last week, the
newspaper issued an apology but said it was too late to withdraw
the special inserts.
   In addition, The Globe printed an apology on Page 3 of the
Sunday paper, and Golf Digest apologized in an advertisment in the
Globe sports section. Last week, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, president
of The New York Times Co., parent company of Golf Digest, sent
Flynn a written apology.
   The article quoted a fictitious member of the 106-year-old club
in the 1880s as saying, ``It's getting so you can't walk around
Boston without tripping over a drunken Kerryman. If we are to
preserve our way of life we must have somewhere to go on weekends .
.. with a high fence to keep the Irish out.''
   The article was apparently intended as humor and written
satirically from the perspective of a historical scholar. It
contained absurdities about the Irish role in building the country
club such as this:
   ``Of course they had to employ Irish laborers to do the heavy
work, but they employed an English construction superintendent who
contracted laryngitis from constantly shouting `Green side up!'
while the workers were sodding the golf course....''
   The protesters gathered Sunday on Castle Island, a peninsula off
the predominantly Irish-American neighborhood of South Boston, and
threw about 20 copies of Golf Digest into the harbor. They also
called for the United States Golf Association to ban Dobereiner
from the grounds of the Open.
   The magazines were later retrieved so as not to litter the
harbor.
   ``We have a right to expect that the Globe would not showcase an
article that was blatantly racist,'' said Kieran Staunton, Boston
editor of The Irish Voice, a weekly newspaper that first drew
attention to the article.
   Globe spokesman Richard Gulla said Sunday retrieving all copies
of the ad would have been impossible, because it was contained in a
section of the paper delivered a week in advance to retail stores
and distributors. Those sections are later sold along with the news
pages.
   An unspecified number of copies of the offending advertisement
were retrieved, he said.
   Only 250,000 of the Globe's 800,000 Sunday papers included the
article because Golf Digest wanted to reach a targeted audience,
Gulla said.

   A weakening 26-year-old woman awaiting a
life-saving liver transplant lived in a pickup truck with her
parents for five days before authorities finally moved them into
dormitory rooms Sunday.
   Pollie Smolenski, who is suffering from a rare liver disorder
called primary biliary cirrhosis, and her parents, Raymond and
Ersley Eldridge, said they are down to their last $150, nearly half
of which is needed for their drive home to Hallie, Ky.
   ``The truck was hot and, you know, there's not a lot of room in
there,'' Mrs. Smolenski said as she rested on a dormitory bunk at
the University of Pittsburgh. ``When it gets hot ... I just get
weaker and weaker.''
   The family lived in a camper atop their pickup in an empty
parking lot on the Pitt campus. They said they bathed with wet
sponges and used public toilets in nearby hospitals and dormitories.
   They said they moved into the truck Tuesday after Mrs. Smolenski
was discharged from Presbyterian-University Hospital, the world's
leading transplant center.
   Officials said the woman entered the hospital for evaluation May
17 and is awaiting a liver transplant.
   ``Her life's at stake here,'' said Mrs. Eldridge, 51. ``We can't
take her home again. It's too far. They don't want her more than 30
minutes away in case they get a liver for her. And we know no one
in this town.''
   Raymond Eldridge, 54, a disabled equipment operator, carried a
hospital beeper in his shirt pocket in case a donor is found.
   Mrs. Smolenski's husband, Daniel, recently returned home to take
care of their three young children. She said he is unemployed.
   Campus policeman Jesse Long said he called university officials
Sunday when temperatures rose to the mid-80s and the family said
their daughter was growing weaker in the heat.
   University officials put up the family, at least for one night,
in adjacent rooms of a dormitory.
   Mrs. Eldridge said social workers have been trying to find a
temporary apartment for the family.
   Liver transplant patients often wait months for donor organs to
become available.
   Hospital spokeswoman Jane Duffield said officials were unaware
the family lacked adequate housing. ``They had told us they had a
camper and they did not tell us they needed housing. We would have
done something,'' she said.
   Miss Duffield said the hospital will find a free apartment for
the family.

   Gold coins and uncorked bottles of
champagne were among the treasures from four shipwrecks, including
the Titanic's sister ship, sold at auction Sunday.
   Recovered items from the R.M.S. Republic, the Spanish galleon
Atocha, the ``Good Luck Wreck'' Regina and the Dutch trade ship
Geldermalsen were sold at the Museum of Yachting.
   About 500 people attended Sunday's auction to bid on such items
as the blue-and-white porcelain recovered from the Geldermalsen.
   Among the items from the Republic were cut glass decanters and
the helm wheel. The Titanic's sister ship, the Republic sank off
the coast of Nantucket, Mass., in 1909.
   On sale from the Regina were navigation lights and bottles of
champagne and scotch.
   About 300 bottles of liquor were brought up from the boat in
salvage operations last fall before cold weather halted the
operation. Workers said several thousand bottles remain underwater.
   The ship was dubbed the ``Good Luck Wreck'' because of the large
number of horseshoes found on board.

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists failed
to win a majority in Sunday's National Assembly elections and must
form a coalition or attempt to govern with a minority.
   With returns lacking only from territories in the Caribbean and
South Pacific, the Socialists and the conservative parties were in
a near dead heat, but only the Socialists were in a position to
form a governing coalition in the 577-seat assembly.
   At least 289 seats are needed for a majority.
   With nine districts still undecided, the Socialists won 272
seats and the Communists 26.
   The conservative Rally for the Republic won 126 seats, the
center-right Union for French Democracy 129 and minor rightists 14
for a total of 269.
   The extreme-right National Front won one seat. Its leader,
Jean-Marie Le Pen, was defeated in Marseille.
   Mitterrand could form a coalition with the Communists or try to
lure centrists away from the rightist camp.
   ``Francois Mitterrand does not have a majority, therefore we
won,'' declared Jacques Toubon, secretary-general of the Rally for
the Republic. ``The ball is in his camp. It is up to him to manage
his defeat.''
   But Pierre Mauroy, first secretary of the Socialist Party, said,
``The right is beaten. It will not win a majority of seats. Only
the Socialist Party is in a position to constitute a parliamentary
majority.''
   Georges Marchais, secretary-general of the Communist Party, said
it was out of the question that his party would participate in a
Socialist government. He said the Communists would support bills it
approved and fight ``everything that goes against its interests.''
   Jean Lecanuet, president of the Union for French Democracy, did
not say whether any of his centrist forces would be prepared to
participate in a coalition with the Socialists.
   ``Personally, I hope that the French get a government made up of
the best,'' he said. ``I wonder if the time has not come for
national union.''
   Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former center-right president, said
the results showed the French did not want one party to have all
the power.
   ``That is a good thing. They tried to say, `we want the two
halves of France to work together,''' he said
   Only 122 of the seats in the National Assembly, the most
powerful house of Parliament, were filled in the first round of the
election June 5.
   Sunday's runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate
won a majority the first time. A first round of voting also was
held for two seats from French Polynesia.
   Voter turnout was estimated at 71 percent, according to the
Interior Ministry.
   Since 1986, when the conservatives won control of the National
Assembly, Mitterrand has been forced into an uncomfortable
``cohabitation'' with the right.
   Following his re-election last month with a 54 percent of the
vote, Mitterrand dissolved the Assembly and called elections three
years early to win a majority.
   In the first round, the two main conservative parties won 77
seats, the Socialists 40, the minor rightist parties four and the
Communists one.
   Pre-election polls predicted a large Socialist majority in the
National Assembly, but the conservatives received more votes in
round one.
   The Socialists and Communists concluded a second-round agreement
in which both parties supported the leading leftist candidate in
each district and withdrew the weaker candidate to prevent
splitting the vote.
   Guy Hermier, a member of the Communist Party Politburo,
reiterated that Communist support for Socialist candidates in some
districts did not mean approval of Socialist policies.
   ``We will judge them by their acts,'' said Hermier.
   The two main conservative parties already backed a single
candidate. But in the few districts in which a far-right National
Front candidate was leading, the traditional rightist candidate
withdrew, and vice versa.
   The main conservative parties denied there was any deal with the

xenophobic.
   Mitterrand said recently that it was unhealthy for the country
to be run by one party alone, but his effort to open his government
to non-Socialists largely failed.
   Candidates on the right also spoke of ending the traditional

   A proposed major Presbyterian statement on
nuclear war was revised Sunday to say a Christian ``normally''
should support the government and nuclear deterrence is immoral
``as an end in inself.''
   A writing team working over the weekend on ``Christian Obedience
in a Nuclear Age'' made the changes, which a subcommittee then
adopted.
   The changes will be presented to a full committee Monday, and
the 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is
scheduled to take up the paper Tuesday.
   Also on the agenda when 630 delegates of the nation's largest
Presbyterian body return to work Monday are the election of a top
denominational officer and a host of other issues, including
pornography, Israel's treatment of Palestinians in occupied
territories and religious freedom.
   The subcommittee of 18 people, including lay, clergy, youth and
seminary advisory delegates, generally adopted the work of the
writing committee Sunday.
   The writing panel had been charged with making the paper's
policy statement and background agree with the revised
recommendations made by the subcommittee earlier.
   Those changes included removing language that would strengthen
corporate church support for tax resisters and other government
protesters and soften language declaring nuclear deterrence immoral.
   The changes shifted some words to play down discussion of tax
resistance and added language saying Christian obedience to civil
authority ``is normally the case.''
   A paragraph was also added recognizing military service as a
legitimate Christian response.
   The revised policy statement also retains condemnation of
nuclear war as immoral. But the original declaration of nuclear
deterrence as being immoral was altered to add the phrase ``as an
end in itself.''
   The proposed policy statement now says: ``The policy of nuclear
deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in itself rather
than an interim measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in
itself is not morally defensible. The work for peaceful
alternatives needs to be vigorously pursued.''
   Supporters of the initial paper said they expect the full
assembly Committee on Peacemaking and International Relations to
restore some of the original language.
   While opponents of the paper agreed that was possible,
``whatever they do to the document, it needs to be sent for
prayerful consideration'' by the church instead of adopted as a
policy, said John Boone, president of Presbyterians for Democracy
and Religious Freedom.
   A nominating committee's decision not to include an incumbent as
a candidate for a top denominational office caught the assembly by
surprise Saturday afternoon. There were indications commissioners
would face a contested election when they vote Tuesday.
   The Rev. James E. Andrews, 60, has been stated clerk or interim
co-stated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by
the reunion of the Northern and Southern branches of the
Presbyterian church. Previously, he held the same office in the
Presbyterian Church (U.S), the Southern church, for 10 years.
   The committee nominated Harriet Nelson, a popular former
moderator _ or chief spokesman _ for the $62,000-a-year job.
   Andrews has said his name will be placed in nomination from the
assembly floor when voting begins. In addition, the Rev. Charles E.
Hurst, a local church executive from Pompano Beach, Fla., will be
nominated from the floor.
   Other committee recommendations include a call for Israel to end
its 20-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with the
United States asked to stop sending aid which is used to subsidize
Israeli settlement of the territories.

   Willie B. and the other gorillas in a new ``rain
forest'' at Zoo Atlanta seemed to take it in stride when the
general public was admitted to the attraction for the first time.
   Thousands of people streamed into the Ford African Rain Forest
after a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday to strain for a look at
Willie B., the zoo's biggest star, in the lush open-air habitat
which replaced the cage he occupied for 27 years.
   The 450-pound gorilla, now about 30 years old, immediately came
to the edge of a restraining moat to strut for the crowd; once, he
ran down a grassy slope, drawing applause.
   On each side, across moats, two families of gorillas recently
brought to the zoo kept a greater distance from onlookers but
remained mostly in the open and not in their shelters.
   Zoo Director Terry Maple said the gorillas, while physically
separated, have interacted in the 2{ weeks they have been together.
   ``They're vocalizing, they're beating their chests, they're
moving this way and influencing the others,'' Maple said. ``The
behavior of animals is enhanced by the presence of others.''
   Zoo Business Manager Dennis Baker said a record for paid
attendance at the zoo was set Saturday, and broken Sunday. Sunday's
crowd was 11,860, with 10,893 paid, passing the mark of 8,522 set
Saturday, when there were also nearly 5,000 free admissions.
   The zoo's best attendance was 17,000 in 1986 when there was free
admission to celebrate Willie B.'s birthday, but the record paid
attendance before Saturday was about 7,400, Baker said.
   The four-acre, $4.5 million rain forest, boosted by $1 million
donated by the Ford Motor Co., is the centerpiece of a renovation
of the 99-year-old zoo, dubbed one of the 10 worst in the country
by the U.S. Humane Society only four years ago.
   Three gorilla families, including the two already present, are
being provided by the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at
Atlanta's Emory University.
   The exhibit includes an adjacent aviary, featuring birds from
the same areas of West Africa inhabited by the gorillas.
   It is the second of 10 habitats planned; a flamingo habitat
opened first. Next year, Maple said, the zoo will present an east
African savanna, featuring lions and elephants and including a pool
deep enough for an elephant to immerse itself.

<DATELINE>TRNAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 15,000 people packed inside
and around a church applauded Vatican demands Sunday that the
communist government permit more Roman Catholic bishops and priests.
   In the first ceremony of its kind since 1973, Vatican
representative Archbishop Francesco Colasuonno consecrated Jan
Sokol as a bishop and apostolic administrator of the archdiocese of
Trnava. The archdiocese is known as the ``Rome of Slovakia''
because of its many historic churches.
   In a 20-minute sermon interrupted at least two dozen times by
applause, Colasuonno called for bishops to fill the vacancies in
nine of the nation's 13 dioceses and more religious education.
   ``Religious life must regain its full rights in a secular
society,'' he said. ``Only if it has its rightful place can it
contribute to the progress and welfare of the citizens.''
   The Vatican emissary indicated Pope John Paul II wants much more
than the authorities' approval of the appointment of Sokol and of
two assistant bishops who were consecrated in Prague on Saturday.
   ``We hope that the negotiatons of the Holy See with all bodies .
.. will bring further results,'' said Colasuonno, speaking in
Slovak. Negotiations between the Vatican and government are
continuing.
   ``This work ... should not end with the appointment of bishops,
but should go much further,'' he said.
   After his consecration the 54-year-old Sokol said, ``I am sure
that this was the first step and that others will follow. The
vacant bishops' sees will soon be filled with good bishops
according to Jesus' heart.''
   There was light applause as the government representatives
entered the church for the ceremony. They sat unsmiling as
Colasuonno expressed the church's demands for more rights.
   ``Believers have the right to have well-prepared and educated
priests'' and orders of nuns and monks need more freedom to recruit
new members, the archbishop said.
   Czechoslovakia's Catholic primate, 88-year-old Cardinal
Frantisek Tomasek, has taken a tougher stand with communist
authorities in recent months.
   In January, he gave unprecedented backing to a petition
demanding religious freedom. Copies of the petitions have been
signed by an estimated 600,000 people in this country with a
population of 15.5 million.
   Tomasek presided at the consecration of the two assistant
bishops for his Prague archdiocese at Saturday's ceremony.
   After the ceremony several hundred people gathered outside
Tomasek's and chanted demands for more religious freedom.
   In Trnava, about 4,000 people were crowded into the church for
the ceremony Sunday and at least 11,000 gathered outside and
listened to the service carried by loudspeakers.
   Sokol was consecrated as a full bishop. But for the archdiocese
that is normally headed by an archbihop he officially serves as an
apostolic administrator.

   Fire gutted a residential apartment
complex for senior citizens Sunday in this southeastern Minnesota
town, but authorities searching the smoldering ruins believed
everyone was safe.
   Hastings Fire Chief Donald Latch said authorities believed all
residents of Oak Ridge Manor were accounted for. Firefighters
entered the burned-out three-story wood structure by midafternoon,
checking each room to see if anyone had been trapped.
   All residents, including some in wheelchairs, were believed to
have escaped, Latch said. ``If that's true, that's amazing,'' he
said.
   The fire's cause remained unknown, Latch said.
   The building had 106 units with 109 residents, said Jackie
Northard of the Red Cross disaster services team. About 40 to 50
people were evacuated from the building, the Dakota County
sheriff's office said.
   Mayor Lu Ann Stoffel said two or three buses took residents to
the hospital and a nursing home.
   Once they arrived, they were given lunch and offered medical
examinations, said Leslie Daley, a 75-year-old retired minister who
escaped the blaze.
   Since many residents had left with relatives for the weekend, it
was unknown how many were in the building when the blaze started.
   The Red Cross was providing food, clothing and housing, and
people volunteered their homes to the elderly residents, the mayor
said.

   Former soldiers loyal to deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos raided a military armory in a failed
attempt to free colleagues jailed for past coup attempts, the
military said.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
said the group got away with 24 automatic rifles in their Saturday
attack. Montano said they had intended to free Orlando Dulay, a
former army colonel, provincial governor and assemblyman who was
close to Marcos when he was president.
   Dulay has been jailed at suburban Camp Crame for more than a
year on charges he ordered the killing of several supporters of
President Corazon Aquino during the 1986 presidential election that
ended Marcos' 20-year reign.
   The military also announced that it filed murder and kidnapping
charges against a Swede, a West German and a Filipino of German
descent who were arrested in a rebel-infested area on Wednesday.
   They were accused of taking part in a raid by communist New
People's Army guerrillas on a town southeast of Manila in February.
Two people were killed and two soldiers were abducted in the raid.
   Also Saturday, a Swiss judge ruled that assets held by Marcos in
Switzerland must be returned to his homeland. No figures were
given, but the assets involved were believed to be a small part of
the $1 billion that Philippine officials believe Marcos channeled
into Swiss bank accounts before he fled to exile in Hawaii.
   Marcos, who was living in Honolulu, said Saturday that he was
leaving the possibility of an appeal to his lawyers.
   The raid occurred at Camp Crame, the constabulary's national
headquarters. Most of the 160 detainees there are soldiers accused
of common crimes, but at least 34 of them are accused of taking
part in coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   Montano said troops were prepared for the raid because of
intelligence reports earlier that ``Marcos loyalists'' would try to
free Dulay. He did not elaborate.
   He said the raiders broke into one office of the armory and
stole some weapons, then sped toward the jail compound in a van and
a car but were fired on by sentries who spotted them.
   The raiders immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief
gunfight by other soldiers near the camp's gym, Montano said.
   Lt. Col. Cris Maralit, a constabulary spokesman, said some of
the raiders were believed hit in the exchange, but no casualty
figures given.
   A few hours later, troops were placed on maximum alert
nationwide, but officials said the move was not related to the Camp
Crame incident.
   They said the alert was a routine measure to prevent disruption
of Sunday's celebration of the 90th anniversary of the declaration
of Philippine independence from Spain.
   Late Saturday, the army chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa,
described the Camp Crame incident as an isolated one meant to
embarrass the government two days before Mrs. Aquino departs for
visits to Switzerland and Italy.
   ``We would like to appeal to our people not to be disturbed by
what happened at Camp Crame,'' he told reporters. ``I am very
confident that our commanders who are tasked ... to protect public
safety will be able to do their job.''
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, chief of the military's Southern
Luzon Command, said in a telephone interview that murder and
kidnapping charges against two Europeans and a Filipino were filed
Friday before a civil court in Quezon province.
   He claimed his command had ``heavy evidence'' against the Rev.
Klaus Schmidt, 52, a West German Protestant minister; Stellan
Hermansson, 30, a Swede who says he is a free-lance journalist; and
Antonio Bosch, a Filipino businessman.
   Sweden's Young Communist League said Friday in Stockholm that
Hermansson was the organization's president. It said he arrived in
the Philippines on May 18 to gather information for lectures and
was to have returned to Sweden Saturday.
   Hermansson and the two others were being held at the command
headquarters in Lucena, 60 miles southeast of Manila.
   Col. Hernani Figueroa said the charges stem from a New People's
Army raid on the Quezon province town of San Francisco last
February in which two police officers were killed and two soldiers
abducted.
   The soldiers, who eventually escaped, identified Schmidt,
Hermansson and Bosch as being with the San Francisco raiders,
Figueroa said.
   Hermansson denied the charges, said Eha Arg, first secretary of
the Swedish embassy. He visited Hermansson on Saturday.
   ``He (Hermansson) denies the charges, because he was not in the
country in February,'' Ms. Arg said in a telephone interview.
   A West German embassy officer visited Schmidt but could not be
contacted for comment because the mission was closed on the weekend.
   The military has accused the three of helping train communist
guerrillas.

   President Corazon Aquino proclaimed a
decade of nationalism Sunday and urged Filipinos to be steadfast in
the struggle against ``forces at home and abroad'' who want to keep
the country poor and subservient.
   Mrs. Aquino made the remarks from a grandstand at the seaside
Rizal Park as she led the country in the observance of the 90th
anniversary of the declaration by Filipino revolutionaries of
independence from Spain.
   About 20,000 people stood under a light drizzle and cloudy skies
during the ceremonies, which included a two-hour parade.
   Less than a mile away, hundreds of riot police blocked about
4,000 leftists who tried to march to the U.S. Embassy. The
protesters burned an American flag, chanted anti-U.S. slogans and
demanded the closure of U.S. military bases in the country.
   Still farther away on a downtown Manila square about 5,000
supporters of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos held a peaceful
rally during which they attacked Mrs. Aquino's government and
demanded the return of their exiled leader.
   In the liberty town of Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, about
3,000 leftist protesters rallied outside the main gate of the U.S.
Clark Air Base. Police said the three-hour demonstration ended
peacefully.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Godspell' Opens at the Lamb's Theater</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventeen years after it first opened in New
York, ``Godspell'' has come home with its simplicity, good humor
and joyous sense of wonder intact.
   The production, which arrived Sunday at the Lamb's Theater, is
not so much a revival as a repolishing of the original material
while adding bits and pieces from today's follies and foibles to
bring it up to date. Ronald Reagan is here. So are Jim and Tammy
Bakker. Even Pee Wee Herman gets into the act, although he and the
other names from current events are not the essential part of the
story.
   The musical remains a carefully crafted piece of street theater
that seeks to instruct if not convert. The book, devised by
John-Michael Tebelak, follows the Gospel According to St. Matthew,
reinterpreting the live of Jesus as well as the parables he told.
   Tebelak's Jesus is a clown, a harlequin with a heart painted on
his forehead and a big red Superman ``S'' on his chest. He's a
teacher and his lessons come right from Matthew's version of the
Bible. He reinterprets many of the most famous parables such as the
prodigal son.
   That reinterpretation is accomplished through a series of
vaudeville turns directed with a sure sense of style and wit by Don
Scardino. There's low comedy, high camp and just about every type
of dumb joke in between. But the concoction works, primarily
because of Scardino's inventiveness and the exuberant score, most
of it written by Stephen Schwartz.
   ``Godspell'' remains the composer's most beguiling work.
Schwartz later went on to write such musicals as ``Pippin,'' ``The
Magic Show'' and ``The Baker's Wife,'' but it is in his first show
that he found the best inspiration. From an anthem like ``Prepare
Ye the Way of the Lord'' to an obvious uptempo show stopper like
``We Beseech Thee,'' Schwartz tailored his music to a young,
enthusiastic cast and still managed to produce one song, ``Day by
Day,'' which found a life outside the musical.
   It's been fashionable to dismiss ``Godspell'' for its naivete
and simple-mindedness, but this revival contains some surprising
moments of power, particularly at the end of the evening when Jesus
is betrayed by Judas.
   The scene is memorable for a fine bit of acting by Jeffrey
Steefel as the street version of the messiah and Robert McNeill as
his betrayer. But then the entire cast exudes a precision and
passion uncommon in most revivals. They are among some of the best
young musical comedy talent around.
   The others include Laura Dean, a bewitching seductress; Anne
Bobby, a sweet-faced singer; Trini Alvarado, a striking woman with
a low, sexy voice; Bill Damaschke, a goofy, likable performer;
Angel Jemmott, a fine comedian and a belter as well; Eddie Korbich,
a real song-and-dance hoofer; Mia Korf, who manages to make ``Day
by Day'' sound fresh, and Harold Perrineau, Jr., a sturdy soul
singer.
   The scenery by Allison Campbell is a generic street scene, while
the costumes by David C. Woolard are thrift-shop eccentric, making
up in color what they lack in high fashion.
   But this resurrection of ``Godspell'' has plenty of style, high
spirits and sense of fun, which make it impossible to resist. It
should win plenty of new converts.

   Hundreds of Canadians nationwide protested the
U.S.-Canada trade bill on Sunday by lighting candles, parading in
cars and stuffing phony ballot boxes with mock votes against the
agreement.
   Several groups of demonstrators in Ontario also rallied near
bridges and other border crossings at Niagara Falls, N.Y., Sault
Ste. Marie, Mich., and Duluth, Minn.
   Opponents of the Free Trade Agreement, which is to begin
relaxing trade barriers between the nations on Jan. 1, demanded
that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney call new elections for
Parliament before the bill goes into effect.
   ``We want a vote _ now,'' demonstrators chanted on Parliament
Hill in Ottawa.
   Trade bill opponents also shouted ``Lyin' Brian,'' a reference
to Mulroney's 1983 statements opposing free trade between the
nations.
   Protesters stuffed carboard boxes with mock ballots rejecting
what they called ``the sell-out of Canada.'' Elswhere,
demonstrators sang protest songs, paraded in cars and lit candles.
   Protests were reported in Edmonton, Alberta; St. John's,
Newfoundland; Victoria, Quebec; and numerous cities in Ontario.
   The protests Sunday were orchestrated by a coalition called the
Pro-Canada Network, a coalition of labor, social, women's, farm and
other groups. They say the bill will sell out Canada's economy,
culture and social programs.
   Mulroney and President Reagan signed the agreement Jan. 2. It
would eliminate tariffs and reduce other barriers in nearly every
facet of the $150 billion annual trading partnership.
   The changes would begin next year and be phased in during a
10-year period.
   The agreement, however, must be approved by Congress and
Parliament, and it faces staunch opposition from lawmakers in both
Washington and Ottawa.
   Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party controls 208 seats in
the 282-member House of Commons, but public opinion polls show
Canadians are sharply split on the agreement.
   Opposition stems from a variety of areas. Ontario grape growers,
for example, are upset because the agreement would eliminate an
automatic 65 percent markup on U.S.-made wine.
   Ontario, the industrial and financial giant of Canada's 10
provinces, has also seen strong opposition to the agreement.
   Liberal Lloyd Axworthy and New Democrat Steven Langdon both told
the Ottawa crowd Sunday they will continue attempts to block the
government's legislation in the Commons, where the bill is up for
second reading.
   ``We will make sure that Canadians get a full opportunity be
heard,'' said Axworthy.
   In Edmonton, Alberta, about 100 protestors gathered at city hall
and others picketed the homes of conservative ministers of
Parliament.

   Democrats agreed Sunday that their
platform must brand South Africa a terrorist state, but bickered
over whether to call for a freeze in Pentagon spending.
   Winding up a long weekend at this quaint resort, the Democrats'
platform drafting committee sidestepped the question of the federal
budget deficit and whether to call for higher taxes on the rich as
Jesse Jackson wants.
   The 16-member drafting committee left that and other issues that
separate the Michael Dukakis and Jackson camps for another day. It
took no votes, but will meet again sometime before the full
186-member Platform Committee convenes in Denver June 25-26.
   Before adjourning, the Democrats released working papers on 10
issues hashed out behind the scenes by the committee staff and
Dukakis and Jackson campaign officials. These briefs call for
appointment of a federal drug czar, adoption of the Equal Rights
Amendment, ending homelessness, expanding AIDS research, and
providing advance notice of plant closings.
   ``I found more areas of agreement that disagreement,'' Rep.
William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panels' chairman,
said after wrapping up the three-day meeting.
   Those who hoped for blood ``will find the floor is clean,'' said
Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief. But significant
gaps remained between the Dukakis and Jackson stances on taxes,
defense and foreign policy that could be fought out in Denver or on
the convention floor next month in Atlanta.
   There was no argument, though, over the Jackson campaign's
insistence that the platform denounce South Africa as a terrorist
state.
   Rep. Robert Matsui, a Dukakis backer from California, said, ``We
have no problem calling South Africa a terrorist state, but let's
go beyond that.''
   Madeleine Albright, Dukakis's foreign policy adviser, said the
Massachusetts governor favors passage of the tougher sanctions in
the Dellums-Wolpe bill that would give the secretary of state 60
days to decide whether to put South Africa on a list of terrorist
nations with Libya and Iran.
   Divisions among the platform drafters quickly resurfaced when
the discussion turned to freezing the Pentagon budget and whether
the United States should renounce any first use of nuclear weapons.
Two AFL-CIO leaders on the panel counseled against too dovish a
stance.
   Rachelle Horowitz, political director of the American Federation
of Teachers, said the Democrats must root out waste in the
Pentagon, but also ``honor our treaty obligations and defend
democratic institutions and our freedoms. I hope this platform will
call for a stable defense budget and not for any specific freezes
or cuts.''
   Leslie McLemore, a political science professor and Jackson
stalwart from Jackson State University in Mississippi, replied,
``The defense budget is not a sacred cow. I wish to see Congress
persons and commissioners and judges and everybody run on this
platform and feel comfortable with it, but we cannot dupe the
American people.''
   ``As Democrats, we owe the country a serious look at freezing
and cutting that defense budget and shifting those funds'' to
social programs, McLemore said. ``I really don't think we can get
out of the maze by saying to the American people that we'll deal
with it in the sweet by and by.''
   Matsui defended the notion of a stable defense budget, saying,
``You just can't say we're going to pull out of Korea or pull out
of Western Europe in the next 12 or 24 months.''
   And when McLemore urged the party to join the Roman Catholic
bishops in renouncing any intention of using nuclear weapons, James
B. Booe, the secretary-treasurer of the Communications Workers of
America, rose to the defense of deterrence.
   ``Over 40 years of negotiating with a lot of people ..., I'll
tell you I don't tell any adversary for sure I'm not going to do
anything. From a bargaining standpoint, from a diplomatic
standpoint, I want to keep them off balance,'' Booe said.
   Another Jackson delegate, Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga.,
lawyer, urged that the platform embrace Jackson's Middle East views
on self-determination for the Palestinians, but there was no reply
by the Dukakis forces.
   But Albright told reporters flatly that the platform will not
contain language that Jackson wants endorsing self-determination
for the Palestinian people.
   The working paper on defense and foreign policy, as well as one
on government and voting reforms, will be written later and
distributed to the drafting committee before its second meeting,
which Gray said may be held June 24 in Denver on the eve of the
full panel's session.
   Michael Barnes, Dukakis' chief platform representative, said,
``There are differences and the differences are important.'' But he
predicted, ``We are going to leave (Atlanta) united and determined
to win that election in November.''
   Barnes told reporters, ``We are not seeking floor fights.'' He
said Jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight on any
issue he chooses, but Dukakis will have a large enough majority to
prevail.

   More than 1.5 million people turned out Sunday
to watch the 30th Puerto Rican Day Parade, the city's
second-largest parade.
   More than 75 floats and 50 bands, some of which came from Puerto
Rico, participated in the parade, which proceeded up Fifth Avenue.
Some streets were closed to traffic for the afternoon. Police
reported no major problems.
   The parade, under a near cloudless sky and in warm temperatures,
drew many of the city's 1.1 million Puerto Ricans.
   It featured the theme ``Yes to school and no to drugs.''
   Entertainer Jose Feliciano said at the parade: ``I feel great to
support our people, but the most important thing of all is that I'm
proud to be a Puerto Rican American.''

   Michael Dukakis has a net worth of at least
$500,000 in property, investments and salary and is the potential
beneficiary of about $1 million controlled by trusts, according to
his financial disclosure forms and statements made by his
presidential campaign aides.
   But the Massachusetts governor, who once described himself as a
``man of few wants,'' lives in a duplex he bought 17 years ago for
$25,000, drives a 5-year-old Dodge, buys his clothes at a bargain
basement and generally vacations at the homes of friends or family.
   ``He and Mrs. Dukakis live comfortably, but I think frugality is

   A substantial majority of Americans say they
would not vote for Ronald Reagan, winner of two landslide
presidential elections, if he could seek a third term, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Most Republicans in the national poll supported Reagan for
another term. But Democrats and independents, whose support was
critical to his 1980 and 1984 victories, said overwhelmingly they
would not back him again.
   The decline in Reagan's support outside his own party could
impede his ability to draw non-Republicans to Vice President George
Bush, who has locked up the 1988 GOP presidential nomination. Bush
needs outside votes to win.

``Ride the Dark Trail.''
   A few hours before his death he was proofreading the manuscript

   An AIDS drug can dramatically boost the
intelligence of youngsters whose brains are damaged by the AIDS
virus and even restores their ability to walk and talk, researchers
said Sunday.
   Damage to the brain is one of the earliest and most devastating
of the effects of the lethal virus in children. The research
suggests that the drug AZT can reverse these symptoms and
apparently bring virus-damaged brain cells back to health.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine
routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults,
it can slow the progression of AIDS but does not cure it.

agitation at Beijing University.
   ``Our college students should uphold the (Communist) party
leadership, uphold socialism,'' the official party newspaper, the

   Beijing University authorities tore down dozens of posters
students had put up in the past week. The posters demanded
democracy, an end to government bureaucracy and corruption, and
better living conditions.
   Putting up anonymous posters is against university rules.

   On a small dairy farm tucked under the Canadian
border, the ``For Sale'' sign has come down. Vermonters, worried
that the small farmer might become an endangered species, hope it
is the beginning of a trend.
   What prompted Gary Jacobs to change his mind and stay on his
100-cow farm was the promise of $5,000 cash this year from the
state.
   Most of Vermont's 2,700 farmers are eligible for the subsidy
under the first such program ever enacted by a state. Farmers have
until Wednesday to apply; a maximum of $5,000 will be paid each
farmer.
   The subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such a
large role in the heritage of one of the nation's most rural states
would soon vanish from the landscape.

   It may look more like a coffee klatch
than researchers hard at work on a new product, but that's the
whole idea.
   The concept of group decision-making triggered by spontaneous
encounters is shaping the design of a $75 million research and
development center being built at Steelcase Inc., the world's
leading designer and manufacturer of office furniture.
   Not only does the new seven-story, pyramid-shaped building
represent a shift in Steelcase's own corporate culture; the company
also hopes to market the concept of group creativeness to its
customers.
   ``Buying new furniture and computers won't get people to be more
productive,'' company spokesman Peter Jeff said. ``Customers are
coming to us with a larger agenda. They want to understand how they
can work better and how their people can work better.
   ``But before we can be the office environment company for anyone
else, we have to be it for ourselves.''
   Though teamwork and spontaneous meetings are nothing new, it's
unusual for a company of Steelcase's size to tinker with success.
The 76-year-old company had about $1.5 billion in sales last year.
It controls about a quarter of the office furniture market,
according to Anne Fallucchi, editor and co-publisher of Facilities
Design and Management, a New York City-based trade magazine.
   The new Corporate Development Center is architecturally designed
to foster communication among all levels of the organization,
putting in practice the theory that spontaneous interaction is the
best catalyst for creativeness. About 400 of the 8,000 workers the
company employs in Grand Rapids will be moved into the building,
just south of its headquarters early next year.
   ``We're trying to provide as many opportunities as we can in
this building for people to run into one another,'' said Wayne D.
Veneklasen, organizational environmental psychologist for Steelcase.
   ``Research shows that 80 percent of professionals' ideas come
from face-to-face communication.''
   To encourage that kind of spontaneity, there are few barriers in
the building; escalators are used instead of elevators (``People
never talk on elevators,'' Veneklasen said); and four entrances to
the building feed into a central meeting place, or ``town square''
in the atrium.
   Using what designers have dubbed the ``cave and commons''
approach, each employee will have his or her own private space, or
``cave.'' But in the middle of a circle of caves will be the
group's commons area, also dubbed ``interaction nodes,'' for group
meetings. Each of these areas will be equipped with a coffee and
soft drink bar _ and a marker board for when the conversation turns
to product ideas.
   ``We know that people are going to talk about the stupid
neighbor's dog that kept them up all night long and they're going
to diagram football plays ... But they're also going to talk about
product ideas,'' Veneklasen said.
   ``If one product idea comes out of only one of those coffee
areas, they've paid for themselves for the life of the building,
given our manufacturing abilities,'' Veneklasen said.
   Executives will be in the directors' cluster, a ring of private
offices in the middle of the building. For the ``lone rangers,''
there will be small offices without telephones or other potential
distractions, Veneklasen said.
   There will be terraces with outdoor work areas and a fitness
trail. Prairie grass will replace the traditional grass and shrubs.
   The company will be structured not by departments, as it is now,
but by projects. All the people involved in a project, whether they
be in the engineering, marketing or design departments, will be
grouped together.
   ``At most companies, the process of developing a product is
usually linear, like a relay race where the person does his part
and passes it on to the next person,'' Veneklasen said.
   ``We're taking the rugby team approach. The designers, the
engineers, the manufacturing people, the marketing people and the
corporate communications people will ... pass the ball back and
forth, but all going in the same direction at the same time.''
   The 573,000-foot building will feature state-of-the-art
laboratories for perfecting the office environment, including
research on office acoustics, lighting and temperature control.
   Steelcase has said the center will serve as a springboard for
its future plans: to add 8,000 employees to its worldwide work
force of 17,500 by the turn of the century.
   It sees the consulting service as a natural extension of its
existing business, where single chairs carry price tags of up to
$900 and big orders for major companies can run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars. Jeff says Steelcase plans no extra charge
to customers for its logistical advice.
   Indeed, such consulting is fast becoming a popular addition to
the industry's sales pitch.
   ``It's not just a question of putting in a desk and a couple of
file cabinets anymore,'' said Simon De Groot, communications
director for National Office Products Association in Alexandria,
Va. ``The aim now is to create an environment that allows office
workers to take full advantage of new technology and be as
productive as possible.''
   But when it comes to advising clients, is Steelcase's open style
for everyone? Some researchers say the concept of group
creativeness, at the heart of Japanese industry, may not work in a
society where individualism is king.
   ``It's like changing somebody's religion,'' said William K.
Redmon, an assistant professor at Western Michigan who has been
studying how well U.S. companies are adjusting to Japanese work
practices.
   Even for Steelcase, the team approach may make some managers
uncomfortable.
   ``It's going to take time for everybody to get used to it,''
admitted Veneklasen.

<HEAD>Study Urges Mexico to Encourage Ties with U.S. Auto Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study commissioned by the Mexican government
says Mexico should strengthen its ties to the U.S. automobile
industry by making it easier to export cars assembled in Mexico and
by upgrading its auto parts industry, according to a report
published Sunday.
   The Detroit News, which obtained the study, said it notes that a
closer alliance between the two nations' auto industries might
develop only if Mexico distinguished itself from Japan, South Korea
and other nations competing in the market.
   The study, conducted by the consulting firm Booz-Allen &
Hamilton Inc., was commissioned last year by the Mexican government
and the Bank of Mexico as part of efforts to obtain World Bank
loans for industrial restructuring.
   ``The Mexican government must differentiate Mexico from other
countries (Brazil, Taiwan, Korea and Japan) in the eyes of the U.S.
Congress and the U.S. public stressing proximity, cultural ties,
common problems and the long period of constructive
relationships,'' the study said.
   ``If U.S. protectionism grows and Mexico is lumped together with
Japan and Korea in retaliatory U.S. trade legislation, all of the
recommendations in this report are moot,'' it said.
   The study estimated that salaried auto workers in Mexico are
paid 20 percent to 25 percent of what their U.S. counterparts
receive.
   The study argued that the lower costs were part of ``Mexican
economic advantages within a North American auto production system
(that) saves jobs for U.S. workers.''
   ``Without access to Mexico, to selectively provide low-cost
labor as part of the overall process, more vehicles ... and parts
would be obtained from Brazil and various Far East countries with
the consequent loss of both U.S. and Mexican jobs,'' the study said.
   Booz-Allen recommended that Mexico immediately upgrade its auto
parts-making industy, which accounted for more than half of that
nation's $900 million auto exports trade surplus in 1986.
   The study also called for easing regulations on companies
already assembling cars in Mexico to encourage more exports to the
U.S. It also recommended that Mexico establish a technical center
in Detroit to keep pace with technological developments.
   The Big Three U.S. automakers each have assembly, engine and
parts plants in Mexico. Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.
spokesmen said they were unaware of plans to increase investments
there. A Ford Motor Co. spokesman said company doesn't discuss
possible investments.
   Booz-Allen said Mexico would have to convince the United Auto
Workers union that an automotive alliance would benefit both
countries.
   But UAW Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens said the union
remained opposed to Mexican auto investments that he said exploited
workers there and caused the loss of U.S. jobs.
   ``If the Mexicans develop a more competitive industry, it will
mean the loss of more jobs,'' he told the News.

<HEAD>New Breed of Farmers Dealing Directly with Commodities Exchanges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPSHIRE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The successful farmer of the future may
be the one who pays the closest attention to the futures, say a new
breed of computerized farmers who deal directly with the nation's
commodities exchanges.
   Clyde Hagemann, 44, who grows soybeans and corn and fattens
feeder cattle on his family's 1,800-acre farm near this Kane County
community, is typical of the new breed.
   Although Hagemann wears a soiled cap from a fertilizer company,
he doesn't resort to the marketing strategies many other farmers in
his area still use. Instead of delivering his corn and beans to the
local elevator every year and selling them through a forward
contract, Hagemann sells his crops and cattle months in advance in
complex contracts directly on the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hagemann's computer and his constant electronic display of
commodity price quotes are as important to his farming as his
combine and his corn dryer.
   Experts say that by using the futures exchanges to market their
products, farmers can obtain price stability _ particularly in
volatile markets like the one being driven by the current drought _
along with marketing versatility, and they can maximize profits.
   Hagemann told the Chicago Tribune recently that he has been
dealing directly with the exchanges for 20 years, which makes him
something of a pioneer in the process, used by only 10 to 15
percent of the nation's farmers.
   Farm experts, commodities brokers and farm economy consultants
say farmers who learn the new marketing techniques have a definite
advantage over their more tradition-bound neighbors.
   ``The family farm is romantic history,'' says consultant Dan
Markey, who conducts marketing seminars for farmers throughout the
nation. ``Farmers must use modern business tools if they are to
survive, and that specifically includes the use of futures and
options.''
   Another farmer who hedges by selling and buying futures and
options contracts is Robert B. Johnson, 44, who operates a
3,000-acre corn, soybean and hog farm east of De Kalb. Johnson, who
studied the marketing techniques at a local junior college, says he
doesn't understand the attitude of other farmers who staged
demonstrations outside the Board of Trade some years back to
protest what they believed was price manipulation.
   ``The speculator does not set the price of the commodity; rather
the market sets the price,'' says Johnson.
   Nonetheless, Johnson and others advise them to make a serious
study of marketing techniques before attempting to use them.
   ``You cannot get too close to the market; particularly during
these times of extreme price volatility,'' warns computerized
Shabbona farmer Rob Mullins, 23. ``A lot of farmers come in here
and just watch the quotes as they come across the screen, when they
should be out watching their crops.''

   Striking United Auto Workers members approved a
contract Sunday with C&C Inc., the union's first such agreement
with the vehicle conversion company, officials said.
   Members of Local 4077, representing 651 employees at three
plants in Brighton, voted 303-80 to approve the three-year
contract, said Nancy Howard, the local's financial secretary and
treasurer.
   She said employees would begin reporting to work Monday morning.
   Negotiators reached tentative agreement on the contract early
Saturday, nearly three days after workers walked off their jobs
when talks bogged down. The UAW won the right to represent C&C
workers in December.
   The strike had halted conversion work on Ford Motor Co.'s
Mustang convertibles, Chrysler Corp. models for export to Europe
and four-wheel-drive chassis for General Motors Corp., officials
said.
   ``It's a contract that greatly improves working conditions at
the three plants,'' Eddie Fuson, acting plant chairman and a
bargaining committee member, said Sunday.
   The contract improves salary ranges of $4.50 to $10.50 an hour
to about $6.25 to $12.50 an hour and more for some skilled trades
workers, Fuson said.
   It also provides improved pension benefits and seniority rights,
he said.

dollar was strengthened following a weekend remark by U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson that there was room for
the U.S. currency to rise.
   Johnson, speaking to reporters last Saturday in West Germany,
said he thought ``there would be a certain tolerance for (the
dollar to rise).''
   The dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dollar
showed ``no major movements'' in early Tokyo trading because of
market holidays in Hong Kong and Sydney.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 151.66 points Friday, gained 59.59
points or 0.21 percent, in the first 15 minutes of trading, moving
to 27,979.95.

<HEAD>Texaco, Icahn Face Showdown Later This Week</HEAD>

   Texaco Inc. and its biggest shareholder, Carl C.
Icahn, may be headed for a showdown this week that could determine
the course of their acrimonious takeover dispute.
   Icahn is waging a proxy fight for five seats on the 14-member
Texaco board in an effort to pressure the oil giant to let
shareholders vote on his $60-a-share offer for the 85.2 percent of
Texaco stock that he does not already own.
   The bid values the entire company at $14.6 billion.
   The deadline for the proxy votes on the board seats is Friday
when Texaco plans to hold its annual shareholders meeting in Tulsa,
Okla.
   Texaco, which is based in White Plains, N.Y., has rejected
Icahn's buyout proposal, and has questioned his ability to finance
it.
   Wall Street has also been skeptical about the offer. Texaco
finished last week at $51.87{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   But Icahn has said he is so certain he could arrange the
financing that he says he would put $300 million in escrow for
payment to shareholders if he failed to arrange it by the date of
the shareholder vote on the offer.
   Meanwhile, a published report over the weekend said court
documents show an investment firm that has a large stake in Texaco
considered selling its stake and Icahn once tried to bring in
Canadian investor Marc Belzberg to buy it.
   The New York Times reported that the court papers indicate the
deal never took place, however, because the parties could not agree
on a price.
   The Times said its report on Saturday was based on documents
unsealed at the newspaper's request by Judge Gerard L. Goettel of
U.S. District Court in White Plains, who had earlier denied access
to depositions taken in suits between Icahn and Texaco related to
Icahn's takeover effort.
   The Times story said that Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman of
Bears, Stearns & Co., a brokerage house that bought stock for the
investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co., said in a
deposition that Icahn once considered selling his shares to the
buyout firm.
   The newspaper said Greenberg was acting as a go-between, and in
several proposed transactions, the buyer and seller were unaware of
each other's identities.
   It said Greenberg did not identify Belzberg in his deposition,
but that a Bears Stearns lawyer did later. It said the deposition
makes clear that Icahn and not Greenberg recruited Belzberg as a
potential buyer.
   The newspaper said Greenberg's deposition indicates the
transaction never took place because the parties could not agree on
a price.
   On Friday, Icahn said he was forming a new holding company to
act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a possible
hostile takeover bid for Texaco. He said the holding company
intended to raise up to $3.25 billion through an offering of stock
and debt securities.
   The Icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to the
holding company, including its 36.1 million shares of Texaco and
its interests in Trans World Airlines Inc. and ACF, a leasing
company.
   Icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the
Texaco board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he
would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding
company at yet to be determined terms.
