   Ethiopian guerrillas on Thursday claimed
they captured three garrison towns in northern Ethiopia, including
Korem, the site of a major government food relief station in the
drought-stricken region.
   The towns were taken Wednesday, according to Yemane Kidane, a
Tigrean Liberation People's Front official. He said nothing of
casualties.
   Yemane said a joint force of the People's Front and the newly
formed Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement took Korem, in Wollo
province, while People's Front forces simultaneously captured the
garrison towns of Amba Alage and Kasad Gudu in southern Tigre
province, Wollo's northern neighbor.
   The inaccessibility of Ethiopia's northern region makes
independent verification of government or rebel claims difficult.
   In Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, government spokesman Teklu
Tabor refused to comment. Western sources said they had heard no
reports of any of the towns falling.
   Widespread crop failures last year have left 1 million people in
need of emergency food aid in Wollo. Korem, 250 miles north of
Addis Ababa, has been a major government food distribution station.
Government relief workers there have been handing out one-month
rations to about 6,000 people a day.
   Fighting in Tigre and Ethiopia's northernmost province, Eritrea,
has crippled relief operations aimed at feeding an estimated 3.2
million drought victims in those provinces. There are 7 million
drought victims nationwide.
   Yemane said the rebel operation was aimed at thwarting a big
offensive President Mengistu Haile Mariam is preparing for Tigre.
The push started in Eritrea and stalled, said Yemane, repeating
claims made by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   The secessionist Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been
fighting for 27 years in Africa's longest civil war. The Tigrean
Liberation People's Front took up arms against the Addis Ababa
government in 1974 demanding greater autonomy.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies 14 years ago when he, with a
group of army officers, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie. The
government and the two rebel fronts all are Marxist.
   Yemane rejected Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's plea at the
summit in Addis Ababa of the Organization of African Unity that the
rebels make peace with the government.
   ``There will be no peace in Ethiopia unless Mengistu is
destroyed,'' Yemane said.

<HEAD>Report: Bush, Meese Met Secretly To Discuss AG's Legal Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush met privately with
Attorney General Edwin Meese III recently to discuss political
ramifications of the attorney general's ongoing legal problems,
according to a published report.
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources in Washington
and in Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush is vacationing, reported in
Saturday editions that the secret meeting took place at Meese's
request shortly before May 16.
   The newspaper said it could not be learned what Bush had told
Meese. Two Bush aides earlier this month called Meese a campaign
liability, but the vice president denied he had authorized the
statements.
   In the past, the vice president has declined to comment on
whether the embattled attorney general should step down, claiming
he didn't want to prejudge the case.
   Meese's financial dealings in several areas are under
investigation by independent counsel James C. McKay, who is
expected to issue a report in several weeks raising questions about
Meese's ethical conduct.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart, contacted in Kennebunkport about
the Post story, said: ``We have no comment on that.'' Hart said he
conferred with Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller, who decided that
the campaign should not respond to the story.

<HEAD>Veterinarian Uses Auto-Body Resin, Fiberglass To Patch Up Snapping
Turtle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinarian who used auto-body resin
and fiberglass cloth to patch up a wounded snapping turtle says his
22-pound patient is ``crawling around nicely.''
   A woman who found the turtle in a pool of blood off Route 28
corralled it into a box and brought it to George Messenger. The
snapper had been hit by a car on the highway, and by the time it
got to Messenger, it had lost a lot of blood and chunks of its
shell were missing.
   Despite Messenger's experience with exotic animals _ including a
cobra from which he removed a mouth tumor _ he had never worked on
a snapper before, let alone a 20-year-old equipped with jaws that
could nip off a finger.
   ``It was very challenging,'' the veterinarian said Thursday.
   After cleaning out the wound and covering it with gauze,
Messenger injected antibiotics into the turtle's tail to fend off
infection. Then he let the turtle rest for a couple days before
operating on Wednesday.
   After trimming away dead and damaged tissue, and using a saw to
cut off damaged bone and shell, Messenger used auto-body repair
resin and fiberglass cloth to repair the damaged shell.
   ``The prognosis is very good,'' Messenger said Thursday. ``He's
crawling around nicely.''
   Messenger said he will keep the turtle for a couple of weeks to
watch its recovery, then let it loose near to where it was found.
Meantime, he said, he will have to find food for it.
   ``I think I'm going to go out fishing,'' he said.

   Warren Buffett, a corporate takeover
specialist whose company holds a major stake in ABC television,
says he doesn't expect an award for his appearance as a bartender
in an episode of an ABC-TV soap opera.
   Buffett is joined in the scene for ``Loving'', scheduled to air
today, by the show's creator, Agnes Nixon, and Thomas Murphy,
chairman of apital Cities-ABC.
   ``They were wise. They didn't trust us with any dialogue,''
Buffett said Thursday.
   He said he has seen a tape of the show and wasn't too impressed
with his performance.
   ``For a town that produced Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando and Fred
Astaire, I'm a sad commentary, I'll tell you,'' he said.
   Buffett's Omaha-based company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is the
largest shareholder of Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which owns the
television network.
   The scene is set in a restaurant where Murphy plays a waiter and
Miss Nixon portrays a customer.
   During the scene, Buffett's bartender character and waiter
Murphy are summoned by a headwaiter to eject an unruly young woman
from the bar, Buffett said. None of the three cameo performers
spoke in the scene, he said.
   Buffett said he was invited to appear on ``Loving'' by Miss
Nixon, whom he met at a dinner party at the Winter Olympics in
Calgary.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega has
used detentions, beatings, threats and sexual harassment to
intimidate Panamanians and quell what appeared only a month ago to
be a rising wave of protest.
   Noriega doesn't have to resort to slayings or to arranging for
people to ``disappear,'' as has happened in some Latin American
dictatorships.
   Panamanians themselves are the first to admit they are
unaccustomed to violent abuse and are easily cowed by it.
   ``I took part in demonstrations until they detained me,'' said a
27-year-old lawyer, who asked not to be named for fear of
reprisals. She was released after a half hour, but not before being
insulted, threatened and fondled by policemen.
   ``We are not Nicaragua or El Salvador or Afghanistan. We don't
have violence in our blood,'' said Ivan Romero, secretary-general
of the opposition Christian Democratic Party.
   Romero was detained, interrogated and beaten May 5 when he
returned from the United States, where he had gone to take part in
a conference. He was expelled to Miami the next day and allowed to
return on Monday.
   ``There is a triumph of terror,'' he told The Associated Press
in an interview. ``The regime is waging psychological war, and it's
winning.''
   The Defense Forces, which includes police and armed forces and
is under Noriega's command, did not return repeated telephone calls
Thursday asking for a response to these allegations.
   Only three people have been killed in political violence since
the U.S.-backed opposition campaign to oust Noriega began 11 months
ago. There are no ``disappeared,'' the enigmatic status that
military regimes in South and Central America conferred on tens of
thousands of opponents in past decades.
   But there is a secret police, G-2, whose members have
demonstrated ruthlessness. The corps is informed by street spies
called ``toads'' whose pervasive infiltration of everyday life is
taken for granted.
   ``We're not fighters, but a folkloric people; beach, sun and
sea,'' said a young professional jailed and mistreated for a week
last month. ``I myself am that way. It's in our genes.''
   The man said he was suspected of opposition activity and taken
from his home after midnight by several agents to G-2 headquarters.
He was stripped and his wrists handcuffed behind his back.
   Asthmatic and frail, he was forced to stand under a cold shower
for half an hour, punched in the face and abdomen and beaten on the
legs with a rubber hose, he reported. Then he was beaten on the
toes with a blackjack, a pain he describes as ``terrible.''
   Still nude and handcuffed, as he was to remain for 15 hours, he
was thrown into a cell where he was told he would be raped by an
inmate.
   Panamanian rights activists say a sexual element to physical or
psychological abuse of detainees is common. They report that
arrested people are frequently threatened with rape or sodomy.
   The young man was not sexually abused, he said. But when he was
taken from the cell several hours later, he was blindfolded, his
mustache was burned with a lighter and the barrel of a revolver was
placed at his temple.
   ``They told me the cemetery was just down the road,'' he said.
   ``My life is the university, work and my girlfried,'' said the
man, who fears reprisal if his name appears in print. ``Those seven
days were like a parenthesis, a long nightmare.''
   ``The day after I got out, there was a (anti-government) march.
I did not even think about going,'' he said.
   ``Our security forces are more clever than the Argentines (of
the 1970s),'' said Alvin Weeden, a lawyer who in the past year has
represented dozens of people arrested on political charges. ``Fear
is stronger than cadavers. People get used to cadavers, but they
don't get used to fear.''
   He said that since a failed coup attempt in March, the
prevailing paranoia has spread to the Defense Forces. He said the
18 officers and soldiers under arrest in connection with the
attempt have been subjected to treatment as least as humiliating as
that given civilians.
   ``The officers know that if they cast a funny glance at Noriega
or one of his inner circle, they will be under surveillance
themselves,'' said Weeden.
   ``There's even more fear inside the armed forces than outside,''
he said.
   Except for the coup plotters, political detainees are rarely
held more than a few days or a week. Most are required to pay
between $150 and $350 for their freedom, though payments of up to
$10,000 have been reported.
   Opposition leaders and human rights activists call the payments
``ransoms.''
   Weeden thinks the lull in protest and street demonstrations is
passing, a valley to be followed by a surge.
   Romero said he came back to Panama even though his wife pleaded
with him by telephone not to.
   ``I'm showing my face and going ahead to help smash the
terror,'' he said.

   Mathias Rust, the West German aviator who a year
ago slipped across one of the world's most secure borders and
landed a plane at Red Square, remains jailed at Lefortovo Prison
with hopes fading for an early release.
   The dramatic May 28, 1987, flight shook the foundation of Soviet
security and oiled the way for the ouster of Defense Minister
Sergei L. Sokolov and Air Defense chief Alexander Koldunov, but
Soviet citizens still grin at the audacity of the young pilot and
his success in putting one over on the mighty Kremlin.
   Soviet jets scrambled when Rust crossed into restricted airspace
over the republic of Estonia, but the Soviet Air Defense forces
took no action to halt the flight.
   Then, with apparently no warning to security forces in the
nation's capital, the single-engine Cessna swept toward the heart
of Soviet power and buzzed Kremlin landmarks such as Lenin's tomb
and Spassky Tower.
   Rust, now 20, was sentenced Sept. 4 to four years at a
general-regime labor camp on charges of malicious mischief. By
mutual consent with the Soviet government, he is serving his time
at the infamous Lefortovo Prison in eastern Moscow, which in the
past contained American journalist Nicholas Daniloff and U2 pilot
Francis Gary Powers.
   A source close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Rust asked to remain at Lefortovo rather than transfer to a
less restrictive penal institution because the little-used KGB
facility is more easily accessible to his parents and West German
diplomats who are allowed to make regular visits.
   At Lefortovo, Rust has been allowed more visits than he is
officially entitled to. His parents, Karl-Heinz and Monika Rust,
and his 16-year-old brother Ingo, have visited Lefortovo at least
five times since June. Under Soviet corrections regulations,
prisoners are allowed one visit every three months.
   A representative of the West German Embassy is allowed to visit
once each month to bring mail, books and special foods to augment
the prison diet.
   Rust's appeal of his four-year sentence was turned down late
last year.
   The young amateur pilot from suburban Hamburg has issued a
personal request for clemency that does not require a formal reply.
To date, there has been no reply.
   Soviet officials have commented privately that Rust will likely
serve at least half of his term, to show that the Kremlin does not
take such stunts lightly and to discourage any similar incidents in
the future.
   Rust was accused during his two-day trial of endangering the
lives of thousands of airline passengers when he piloted his
borrowed Cessna 172-B from Helsinki, Finland through the flight
paths of foreign airliners headed for Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.
   Witnesses testified that he could have injured some of the
hundreds of pedestrians at Red Square on the cool, sunny evening
when he landed.
   Rust told the court he felt ``remorse and deep repentance'' and
never intended to endanger or insult anyone.
   Before landing in the square, Rust piloted his blue and white
craft at a low altitude through more than 500 miles of closely
guarded Soviet territory.
   The dramatic stunt was followed by a short-lived moment of glory
for Rust as tourists and Muscovites crowded around the plane that
came to a rest between St. Basil's Cathedral and the red-brick wall
surrounding the Kremlin. They asked for the pilot's autograph and
took his picture as he reclined against the fuselage before his
arrest.
   Less than 48 hours later, the ruling Politburo met in special
session and sent Sokolov into retirement and fired Koldunov for
negligence.

<HEAD>Walters Art Gallery Reopens After $6 Million Overhaul</HEAD>

   Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art
Gallery closed for a $6 million overhaul, Baltimore's Renaissance
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate
Henry Walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art
collections in the world.
   The renovation has created for Walters' precious jewels,
bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director Robert P.
Bergman calls a ``seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history.
   ``In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the
collection for the first time,'' Bergman said recently, pointing
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure
viewers. ``We direct people directly to the object through the
lighting.''
   The massive stone building with a marble-columned court
fashioned after the 17th-century Palazzo Balbi in Genoa, Italy, is
one of six comprehensive museums in the United States. Walters
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the
22,000-piece collection.
   The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and
poorly lighted rooms Bergman inherited when he left an art history
post at Harvard University and arrived here are gone. In their
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring
gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask;
polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden
for centuries.
   The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection
spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open
during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more
lie in storage.
   Walters, who made his fortune with the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad, left the collection _ along with a $3 million endowment _
to his native city ``for the benefit of the people.''
   The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving
14th-century Italian perspective paintings called ``View of an
Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school
of Cimabue, the first Raphael Madonna to come to America and one of
only 12 known paintings by Hugo Van Der Goes.
   Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and
light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights,
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces.
   Bergman jokingly calls the project a ``modest calling.''
   ``We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this
collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and
sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said.
   ``To do that was a special project. The building is a work of
art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark
structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as
ceaseless champion of his world-class museum.
   Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with $1 million
in city funds, $1 million in state funds and another $4 million in
contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the
money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches
original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble
columns for a consistent look.
   Going room to room, Bergman marvels at the miraculously
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for Marie
Antoinette; a collection of European porcelains considered second
only to the British royal collection at Windsor Castle; and some of
the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient
Egypt to art nouveau.
   The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a
French goldsmith's shop for Walters' delicate Faberge enamels, an
iris corsage ornament created by Tiffany and Co. and an ivory
orchid comb by Lalique.
   The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before Walters'
death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father,
who began the collection, had done.
   More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000
visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the
official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors
seasoned by a lifetime of trips.
   One after another, they stopped Bergman to thank him for
restoring the collection to splendor.
   ``Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right
thing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Professor's Dream Girl Plans To Move To Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 61-year-old college professor who fell in
love with a Scottish bank teller's machine-recorded voice soon will
get a chance to hear that voice live when the woman of his dreams
moves to his hometown.
   ``It sort of means reducing a fairy tale come true to reality,''
Dick Ferry said Thursday night. ``It could be losing some of its
magic to see her grocery shopping.''
   But actually, Ferry said, both he and his wife Carol are
delighted that Sally Masterson, a British radio talk-show host, has
accepted a job with a radio station in this central Illinois city
of about 94,000 residents.
   It's all because of a newspaper column Ferry wrote after he
heard a teller-machine recording with her voice.
   ``I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' Ferry
wrote in his Feb. 4 column for the Decatur Herald & Review
newspaper.
   ``My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money Network
station at First National Bank downtown,'' he said.
   Intrigued, the newspaper tracked down Ms. Masterson, 30, now a
talk-show host in London, and arranged for her to visit Decatur
last month. She and Ferry met _ with Mrs. Ferry, his wife of 25
years, looking on.
   Ms. Masterson, who is single, had made the teller-machine
recording three years ago in Scotland for NCR Corp. of Dayton,
Ohio, which makes automatic-teller products.
   ``I think he's smashing,'' she said, after meeting Ferry, an
education professor at Millikin University.
   For his part, Ferry said that what began as a romantic fling in
a newspaper column has become a friendship.
   ``I said I was in love with a voice _ and I was,'' Ferry said.
``But I'm in love with my wife. I would hope that Sally is a good
friend.
   ``I don't really expect her to stay in Decatur. I think her
voice is so impelling that she will get offers and offers.''
   Ms. Masterson told the Herald & Review earlier this week that
she has accepted a broadcast job with WDZ radio and will arrive
Sept. 5.
   David Webb, vice president and general manager of WDZ, said he
began talking with Ms. Masterson about the job soon after she made
a guest appearance during her April visit.
   He said Ms. Masterson will have a midday show Monday through
Friday, with the format still to be worked out.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's speech
to the National Assembly Thursday was a mixture of defiance,
nationalism and a brand of patriotic populism that has
characterized Panamanian military leadership for two decades.
   Noriega, under U.S. indictments on drug trafficking charges, had
been expected to give a status report on negotiations with the
United States to end the hostile face-off between the two countries.
   But he dealt little with the talks, which appear to have
collapsed, and concentrated instead on Panamanian sovereignty. The
general suggested that American politicians look to problems and
ethical issues at home before trying to solve them in Panama.
   Noriega also accused American presidential candidates of ``using
the Panamanian flag to win votes.''
   Here are some excepts from the speech and a question-and-answer
period that followed:
   ``Pardon the ignorance but we cannot understand how these rich
candidates in the United States don't use the flag to solve the
problems of the blacks in New York, of the poorer classes, of the
minorities, of those who have no heat, of the foreigners ... those
are pretty themes for democracies.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The theme of Panama is going to constitute a source of
propaganda for candidates who wish to hide their own problems, for
candidates who wish to bury files that weigh down on the backs of
that democracy.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``Panama is a quiet, respectful country. Here no American has
ever had a problem. He has not been kidnapped, he has not been
assassinated in the street, his embassy has not been burned as it
was burned in Honduras, so they should respect Panama.''
</TEXT>

   ``They invent great problems in small countries in order to

</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The Panamanian people are paying a very high cost for the bad
information and bad decisions of the United States of America. It
has converted a traditionally friendly country such as this one
into a country full of strong feelings and resentment.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``There was never a trick. There was never a lie. The lies came
from the United States. The trick never came from Panama nor from
the Defense Forces. We always spoke highly, clearly, concisely and
directly. There can be no negotiations ... because there must be
conversations ... respecting with dignity the sovereignty,
respecting the right of self-determination of Panamanians, the
suspension of economic aggression, the departure of troops beyond
those called for in the (Panama Canal Treaties), and respect for
the constitutional decision by the Panamanian parliament that
Manuel Solis Palma is the president of the republic.''

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
ended two-day's hospital treatment for chest pains Thursday, saying
he will ask U.S. officials to let him return to his homeland for
the funeral of his mother.
   ``I'd like to go home and preside over the funeral rites of my
mother,'' Marcos said from a wheelchair during a news conference
before he was discharged from St. Francis Medical Center.
   Marcos said his application for permission for him and his
family go to the Philippines and return to the Unites States at
will would be submitted Thursday or Friday at the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization office in Honolulu.
   When asked whether the application would be a request to return
permanently to the Philippines, Marcos replied, ``Well, what else?
I would like the ordinary rights of a citizen.''
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino, saying Marcos poses a
threat to national security, has repeatedly rejected his pleas to
return for the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who
died May 4 at age 95.
   Marcos said Mrs. Aquino should reconsider because, ``I've told
them I will not bother them ... but will hold back the people from
starting violence. She alone will not be able to hold them back.''
   INS Western Region Commissioner Harold Ezell said he favored
allowing Marcos to return, but said the final decision rests with
Mrs. Aquino.
   ``We believe there is a humanitarian aspect that has to be
considered,'' Ezell said. ``Whether or not you agree with
everything that's happened, there is still a factor that Ferdinand
Marcos is a human being who had a mother who has passed away.''
   Marcos is under ``a prevent departure notice,'' which means he
needs permission to leave the United States, said INS district
director William Craig.
   Marcos said he did not know how long it would take for the INS
and Philippine government to respond to his latest request. He said
no date has been set for the funeral.
   Marcos was accompanied by his wife, Imelda, several aides, a
nurse and his physician, Dr. Azucena Ignacio, who said Marcos would
be able to travel.
   Ignacio said Marcos' chest pains were caused by arthritis or
inflammation in the area of the left sixth rib. She said Marcos
improved dramatically by resting and was being treated with
painkillers.

   Muscovites give Mikhail S. Gorbachev strong
support for his overall program of change in their country, but
only about half say they have seen tangible benefits of his program
of economic change, a poll has found.
   Only 40 percent of participants in a poll conducted for The New
York Times and CBS News said they expected their families' standard
of living to improve in the next five years, according to the poll
published in Friday's Times.
   And 18 percent of 939 adults in Moscow households with
telephones predicted their standard of living would worsen, the
poll said. An estimated 84 percent of Moscow households have phones.
   The margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   The poll found strong support for Gorbachev's overall program,
with 78 percent supporting his domestic policies completely and 19
percent less than completely. The Times said they especially liked
his calls for greater democracy and openness.
   The newspaper said one of the poll's most striking findings was
that a sizable minority seemed prepared to question the monopoly of
the Communist Party. While 51 percent agreed that the one-party
system in their country promotes development of democracy, 28
percent said they disagreed, the poll found.
   It also said many wanted the liberalization that had begun to be
expanded to include competitive elections, private publishing and
tolerance of public demonstrations.
   The interviews in Moscow were conducted by The Institute of
Sociological Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on May 7,
8, 14 and 15.

<HEAD>Feds Threaten Discrimination Suit Over LA County Supervisors'
Districts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials plan to sue Los Angeles
County for violating the voting rights of racial minorities by
diluting their influence when county supervisors redrew district
boundaries in 1981, a source said Thursday.
   Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds informed
the county by letter last week that he authorized the Justice
Department to sue the county for allegedly discriminating against
minorities in the 1981 reapportionment, said the source, who is
familiar with the case but asked not to be identified.
   The Board of Supervisors must remap its five districts every
decade and to divide the population evenly among them. But the 1981
plan allegedly diluted the influence of Hispanics and other
minorities, the source added.
   County Counsel DeWitt Clinton was called for comment Thursday,
but didn't immediately return the call.
   There has not been a Hispanic supervisor in Los Angeles County's
138-year history. The county's only black supervisor, Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke, was appointed to the board in the 1970s and
subsequently lost a bid for election.
   According to the 1980 federal census, there were more than 2
million Hispanics and 943,000 blacks among the county's 7.5 million
residents. By 1985 there were 2.4 million Hispanics and 964,000
blacks, according to projections by the county Department of Health
Services.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed
Reynolds, who heads the Justice Department's civil rights division,
sent a letter to the county last week, but said she couldn't
comment on its contents.
   In voting rights cases, such letters are sent to allow the
target of a potential lawsuit to negotiate with the Justice
Department and ``avoid the cost and time of litigation, which
doesn't help anybody,'' she said by phone from Washington.
``However, if statutory violations cannot be resolved, then
certainly litigation is a real possibility.''
   Asked what kind of relief the government seeks in such cases,
Ms. Burstion-Wade replied: ``The relief would be to protect
minorities from disenfranchisement.''
   Raul Nunez, president of the Los Angeles County Chicano
Employees Association, said he understood the federal complaint
against the county would involve alleged discrimination against
Hispanics.
   ``We have always felt that the Latino community has been without
power in that they have been fragmented, and they have not been
able to exercise their voting ability,'' Nunez said.
   ``We are aware that county counsel has received a letter from
the Department of Justice,'' Deane Dana, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors, said in a statement. ``He is reviewing it and will be
advising the board. Until that process is complete, we will not
have any comment beyond that.''
   Bradford's letter first was revealed publicly in Thursday
editions of the Los Angeles Times, which cited anonymous sources.
   The Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit in 1985 that
forced the Los Angeles City Council to shift a district from the
San Fernando Valley to the city's largely Hispanic east side. The
suit led to the election to the City Council of former
Assemblywoman Gloria Molina.
   The Justice Department based its 1985 complaint on the 1965
Voting Rights Act, which prohibits redistricting that causes
minority residents to have ``less opportunity than other members
(of the community) to participate in the political process and to
elect representatives of their choice.''
   The lawsuit claimed that the city's 1982 plan splintered the
political influence of Hispanics by spreading them thinly over many
districts.

   Two flight instructors escaped serious
injury when they ejected and parachuted from a TA4J Skyhawk Navy
training jet that crashed and burned Thursday in a forest,
authorities said.
   Marine Capt. Thomas Henry Renken and Navy Lt. j.g. Timothy John
Roorda were picked up by a search helicopter and returned safely to
base, said Lt. j.g. Mary Chamberlin, spokeswoman for the Meridian
Naval Air Station in Mississippi.
   Roorda was being examined for a possible broken leg.
   Chamberlin said the jet, based at Meridian, Miss., was on a
routine training mission and crashed 11:45 a.m. Thursday in the
Scotch Wildlife Management area in southwest Alabama, 13 miles west
of Grove Hill.
   The crash sparked a wildfire near Alabama Highway 154 that was
fought by state forestry fire crews. Law-enforcement agencies
closed off the area pending an investigation of the crash by
military and federal authorities.
   There were no other injuries.

<HEAD>House Passes $1.1 Trillion Budget For 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving with unusual speed toward
final approval of a $1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989
fiscal year, thanks to a little bipartisan cooperation and a lot of
creative arithmetic.
   The House approved the spending plan by a 201-181 vote on
Thursday shortly after House-Senate negotiators reached agreement
on a compromise document after six weeks of haggling.
   The Senate is expected to give quick approval to the measure
after the chamber returns early next month from its Memorial Day
recess.
   The budget meets the spending ceilings for domestic, defense and
international affairs programs set at last fall's budget summit by
President Reagan and congressional leaders.
   It also obeys the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's $146
billion deficit target for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. If the
red ink grows beyond that level, the law calls for automatic
spending cuts to reduce the deficit to $136 billion.
   ``This, I believe, is a balanced approach,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   The numbers used in the document were shoehorned into the budget
summit and Gramm-Rudman limits by lawmakers intent on avoiding
fights over spending and taxes in an election year.
   The legislators used relatively rosy economic assumptions
produced by the White House, rather than more pessimistic
projections calculated by the Congressional Budget Office. As the
economy worsens, government spending grows and its revenue shrinks,
producing more red ink.
   In addition, when their numbers threatened to spill over the
budget summit's constraints, the lawmakers fiddled slightly with
the definitions of the spending categories they used, allowing them
to claim they had abided by their pact with the White House.
   Even with that craftiness, the budget might still surpass the
$146 billion limit set by Gramm-Rudman.
   The law requires a fresh look at the spending plan's projected
deficit in August, using updated readings of the economy's
performance.
   Rep. Delbert Latta, R-Ohio, said James Miller III, director of
the White House's Office of Management and Budget, had told him
Thursday that ``it would be a miracle'' if the automatic spending
cuts are avoided.
   Despite that warning, 26 Republicans joined 175 Democrats in
voting for the measure.
   Final congressional approval early next month would be unusually
quick. The legislators, however, already have upheld their annual
tradition of missing the April 15 deadline set in law for
completing the budget.
   The measure contains $299.5 billion in new defense spending,
$18.1 billion for international affairs and $148 billion for
domestic programs for 1989.
   The Pentagon's $8.1 billion increase over spending this year is
below the amount needed to keep pace with inflation.
   Education, health, social services and job training programs
would all be given enough money to match inflation increases. Some
other programs _ including AIDS research and treatment, anti-drug
initiatives, space and air traffic control _ would be boosted
enough to surpass the costs of inflation.
   The election-year measure would allow an additional $1.4 billion
in anti-drug spending later this year if Congress and the White
House decide that an emergency exists. The extra money would have
to be covered by spending reductions in other areas or by new
revenues.
   In legislation passed in December, $14 billion in new taxes for
fiscal 1989 already have been written into law. The budget approved
Thursday includes no other additional revenues.
   The two chambers had differences of about $1 billion _ small
ones in budget terms _ over how much money should be spent for
science, space and education.
   In their compromise, the lawmakers agreed to $13 billion for
space and science and $37.2 billion for education.
   They also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel
and federal civilian employees to take effect in January.
   The raise would apply to members of Congress, who already earn
$89,500 annually. If included in forthcoming appropriations bills,
members of Congress would earn $93,080 a year, a raise of $3,580.
   The budget does not require the president's signature, and is
used as a guideline by Congress as it passes the 13 appropriations
bills that actually provide money for federal spending.
   But this year, its value seems even more questionable than usual
because the two chambers have already begun work on their spending
measures.

<HEAD>Soviets Express Optimism That Global Ban May Soon Be Near</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet experts accused the United States
of undermining progress on a global chemical weapons ban, but still
expressed optimism that 20 years of talks would soon culminate in
an agreement.
   Leaders of the 13-member Soviet delegation told a news
conference that the talks sorely need a political initiative from
Soviet, American and British leaders.
   However, just days before Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President
Reagan get together in Moscow for their fourth summit, the Soviet
chemical weapons experts took a tough line against U.S. resumption
of chemical weapons production.
   ``Such steps undoubtedly run counter to the aims of a chemical
warfare convention,'' said Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet negotiator
at the 40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament, where the
chemical weapons ban talks have been taking place.
   The news conference Thursday ended the Soviets' three-day visit
here, the first time they have been at a chemical warfare facility
in Western Europe.
   Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, deputy commander of the Soviets'
chemical troops, said current U.S. production of binary weapons _
in which elements that are harmless on their own become lethal when
combined _ is dangerous, ``uncontrollable and unverifiable.''
   He said the U.S. decision to end an 18-year moratorium on
chemical weapons production last December raised Soviet suspicions
that America plans to supply binary weapons to its NATO allies.
   Still, Nazarkin appeared more optimistic than his British
counterpart at the Geneva talks, Ambassador Tessa Solesby, that a
verifiable agreement on the development, production and stockpiling
of chemical weapons can be reached soon.
   ``The international negotiations in Geneva have actually entered
the decisive stage of development ... We firmly believe that this
convention will be achievable soon,'' Nazarkin said.
   ``In order to overcome the differences that still remain,'' he
said, ``what we need is impetuses to solve the problems at a
political level, not a technical level.''
   But Solesby said getting Reagan, Gorbachev and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to give the negotiations a political
push will not solve the main problem of verification.
   ``It is not a matter of lack of political will. ... It's the
technical difficulties that remain,'' she said.
   The Soviets and their British hosts stressed the historic
significance of the three-day visit to Britain's Chemical Warfare
Defense Center at Porton Down in southwest England.
   But they disagreed on the size of the Soviet stockpile and the
wisdom of setting a timetable for reaching a final agreement.
   Nazarkin said ``the successful outcome of negotiations depends
on a time limit to settle and tackle all the unresolved problems.''
   Solesby said: ``We do not feel artificial time limits are
helpful.''
   Gorbachev said last year that the Soviet Union has a 50,000-ton
stockpile. Western estimates have put it at 300,000 tons.
   Nazarkin insisted the Soviets had not lied about the size of
their stockpile and said inspectors may see it as soon as an
agreement is signed. He accused the United States of inflating
their estimates to justify the start of binary weapons production.
   He said the Soviet stockpile was now at parity with the American
stockpile, which he also estimated at 50,000 tons.
   But Nazarkin expressed concern that U.S. binary weapons
production could change the balance. The Americans have not
disclosed the size of their stockpile but Western estimates put it
at 30,000 tons.
   Solesby said America started producing binary weapons to counter
Soviet production and replace its own aging stockpiles.
   During their visit to the 7,000-acre Porton Down facility, the
Soviets held wide-ranging talks with British experts and watched
British soldiers respond to a simulated enemy nerve gas attack.
   In July, a British delegation will visit the chemical warfare
facility at Shikhany in eastern Russia.
   Last October, specialists from the Geneva Conference visited
Shikhany, where they were shown chemical weapons which seemed to
date from the 1950s. The following month, Soviet inspectors visited
a U.S. Army chemical weapons disposal plant at Toole, Utah, where
they were shown techniques for destroying old gas munitions.

<HEAD>Data Shows Most Laid-Off Workers Did Not Have New Jobs Lined Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than three-fourths of the workers who
lost their jobs to plant closings or mass layoffs last year did not
have new jobs lined up when they went off their companies'
payrolls, according to new government data.
   Of the 406,887 victims of plant closings or large layoffs in 29
states in 1987, 78 percent, or 319,343, filed claims for
unemployment insurance benefits, the Labor Department said Thursday.
   The government tracked those people through state employment
offices and found that 85,548, or more than one-fourth of them,
exhausted their unemployment benefits _ an average $139 a week with
a 26-week maximum in most states _ before finding new work.
   The report was hailed by advocates of the 60-day advance notice
requirement that President Reagan cited as a major reason why he
vetoed the 1,000-page trade bill on Tuesday.
   ``With that kind of advance notice, many of these people would
have had an opportunity to seek new jobs while currently employed
and would likely not have had to draw unemployment insurance,''
said John Zaluskey, an economist for the AFL-CIO.
   The advance notice provision was approved by Congress after
surveys by the Labor Department and the General Accounting Office
showed that two of every three U.S. workers caught up in such
layoffs get no warning.
   The National Academy of Sciences said in a report last year that
the Reagan administration's reliance on ``voluntary'' notices is
``not providing workers with the ... `best practice' minimum of two
or three months to adjust successfully to job loss.''
   The academy estimated that advance layoff notices would reduce
by 25 percent the time a laid-off employee is out of work, saving
hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits.
   Reagan, however, said when he vetoed the trade bill that the
layoff notice requirements would ``cost jobs and damage our
economic growth.''
   Business groups supportive of the bill in general had urged
Reagan to veto the measure because of the layoff provision, which
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Richard Lesher called ``the
camel's nose under the tent'' in a broad union agenda for more
government control in the work place.
   The House on Tuesday immediately overrode Reagan's veto, with
Democrats rejoicing that Reagan had given them an issue for
rallying voters in the November election.
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis said Reagan
and Vice President George Bush ``don't understand that for working
families ... there is nothing more painful than losing a job.''
   The Senate, which passed the trade bill on a 63-36 vote that was
short of what would be needed to override Reagan's veto, was
expected to take up the measure again early next month.
   The report Thursday by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics was the first comprehensive examination of the mass
layoff phenomenon ever released by the government.
   Congress in 1983 ordered government statisticians to start
conducting the survey after the nation's unemployment rate soared
to 11.4 percent and the rolls of the unemployed grew to 12.5
million during the first two years of Reagan's administration.
   Since then, the jobless rate has dropped to 5.4 percent _ the
lowest since 1974 _ with fewer than 7 million people now out of
work in the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.
   Of the 29 states surveyed in 1987, two _ Texas and Wisconsin _
accounted for one-fourth of the total layoffs. Five other states _
Louisiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania _
accounted for another fourth.
   The 29 states were Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
   ``Slack'' or ``seasonal'' work was listed by employers in the
survey as accounting for about half of the layoffs. The other
biggest reasons cited for them by employers were completion of
contracts, 7 percent; business ownership changes, 4 percent; and
import competition, 2 percent.

   For the first time in its uniquely American
history, Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus is staging a
colossal three-ring assault on the land of sushi and sumo wrestling.
   ``We are coming to entertain you!'' boomed Jim Holst, the show's
associate producer and former ringmaster, at a Tokyo news
conference Thursday.
   Flanked by five clowns, two jungling acrobats and a hula-hoop
artist, he smiled and intoned, ``It is our hope and our interest
that you will smile and laugh, and hide your eyes in fear.''
   For 15 weeks starting in July, Japanese kids of all ages will be
dazzled by daring trapeze acts, animal tamers, 25 clowns, 16
elephants, 14 lions, and assorted camels, llamas, dogs and
chimpanzees under a big top.
   Coordinating trans-Pacific transportation for beasts, about 300
humans and 100 tractor-trailer loads of lighting and sound
equipment and supplies in the circus' first overseas trip are
enough to astound.
   Holst estimates Ringling Bros. spent at least $10 million for
the production.
   The big top goes up this summer in Sapporo, Tokyo and Osaka.
Organizers hope to attract as many as 1.2 million Japanese and
already are planning a 25-week run in Japan next year.
   ``We are not interested in the short-term profit,'' said Joseph
Gold, Ringling marketing supervisor. ``We want to build a
tradition. The Japanese public may have seen a circus before, but
they've never the `Greatest Show on Earth.'''
   Japanese got a sneak preview this week when Ringling's
promotional team unleased the clowns, jugglers, and hula-hoopist in
full costume on the streets and television airwaves of Tokyo.
   ``Humor is universal,'' said blue-haired Christopher Hudert,
whose nose was painted red. ``At first people are kind of
surprised. But they really like slapstick.''
   The ringmaster will continue to herald the acts in English,
hoping Japanese audiences will pay close attention to his arm as he
points to the various rings.
   Acts among the 130-member troop will include the Human
Cannonball and the Globe of Death, in which two men on motorcycles
race simultaneously inside a large chain-link ball, sometimes with
their wives standing in the middle.
   ``We don't know if what we're bringing will offend people,''
Gold acknowledged. ``Like today, (the Japanese sponsor) wanted to
take the clowns around to some newspapers. I said, why don't you
take four, and I'll take one with me.
   ``He said no _ in Japan, four is an unlucky number. It means
death,'' Gold said. He shrugged and raised his eyebrows. ``I didn't
know that.''
   Ticket prices will run $40 a head _ about the cost of a ticket
to a rock concert here _ compared with a maximum of $12 in the
United States.
   ``We cost maybe twice the price of a movie,'' Gold said. ``But
where else can you see 250 people and animals risking their lives?''

   Conventional wisdom says President Reagan and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will benefit politically by the Moscow summit.
But conventional wisdom isn't infallible.
   Consider the following:
   Reagan is enormously popular at home, but, as he prepares to
leave office, little of that support appears to be transferring to
Vice President George Bush.
   Gorbachev faces problems at home, but most stem from his
stumbling efforts to reform Soviet society. His rivals on the
ruling Politburo appear to agree on the need to improve relations
with the United States, reduce international tension and fix the
Soviet economy. It is the nature, speed and consequences of the fix
that divide them, say the experts.
   Open elections and reliable public opinion polls are still a
thing of the future in the Soviet Union, and instead Western
analysts will be watching a Communist Party conference at the end
of June to determine how much confidence Gorbachev inspires in his
countrymen.
   Numbers, if not answers, are easier to come by in the United
States. Opinion polls show Americans overwhelmingly back arms
control agreements, if they are negotiated carefully.
   A survey this month in the bipartisan Americans Talk Security
series said 77 percent of those polled backed the treaty to
eliminate medium-range missiles. The treaty, signed by Reagan and
Gorbachev at their Washington meeting last December, now appears
headed for Senate ratification in time for the Moscow summit.
   The survey said 82 percent backed a Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty to cut superpower strategic arsenals by half.
   Gorbachev and Reagan both say a START deal is possible by the
end of the year, but they remain divided over U.S. plans for a
missile defense system, verification issues, and limits on heavy
land-based missiles and air- and submarine-launched cruise missiles.
   Reagan's success in bargaining with the Soviets to date may
improve his treatment in history books, but it does not seem to
help Bush, who according to a CBS-New York Times poll last week was
trailing the probable Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis. The poll
gave Dukakis 49 percent to Bush's 39 percent. An ABC-Washington
Post poll this week gave Dukakis 53 percent and Bush 40 percent.
   One prominent Bush supporter, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said that
``the vice president is going to be running on a very powerful
peace and prosperity platform. But the American people have found
that so successful that they are looking at other issues. The very
success of the Republicans has bred a public nonchalance to the big
issues of our time.''
   Critics of the Republican administration attribute progress in
arms control to Gorbachev rather than to Reagan, who entered office
declaring that the Soviets had broken every treaty they had signed
with the United States.
   ``One of the calling cards of the Reagan administration is that
these people have brought the Soviets into line by setting out
tough policies and sticking to them,'' said Jack Mendelsohn, deputy
director of the Arms Control Association, a liberal Washington
group.
   ``But that's not what happened,'' said Mendelsohn. Gorbachev, he
said, changed because he decided it was in the best Soviet
interests.
   Opinion polls indicate broad support for Reagan's approach.
   The Americans Talk Security survey showed that 68 percent of
those polled favored caution in dealing with the Soviets, compared
with 28 percent who advocated seizing the opportunity presented by
Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev may be losing his fight to stack the June party
conference in his favor, said Walter Laqueur and Thanne Gustafson
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Of the 5,000 delegates to the conference, said Laqueur, 3,500
will be made up of government and party officials thought to oppose
Gorbachev's reform efforts, and most of the rest are being selected
to regional party organizations, many of them also hostile to
Gorbachev.
   ``The outlook is for a conservative membership,'' said
Gustafson. And that could stymie Gorbachev's perceived drive to win
a comfortable majority on the Central Committee, the policy-making
body which until now has put the brakes on his more radical ideas.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks Jurisdiction Over Chicago Futures Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
declaring its independence from the Reagan administration by
pushing its own proposals in the regulatory turf war that has
followed the October stock market crash.
   A sharply divided commission voted 3-2 to ask Congress for
jurisdiction over the stock index futures markets in Chicago, an
area now regulated by a sister agency, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   Members voting for the proposal noted that the SEC already
regulates the trading of stocks and stock options and said that it
was only logical that the SEC also oversee trading of futures
contracts based on stocks.
   The SEC has already lost on the issue in an interagency working
group formed to develop administration policy on market reform. The
panel, whose members represented the Treasury Department, Federal
Reserve Board, SEC and CFTC, issued a report last week calling for
no major legislative initiatives.
   Democrats in Congress reacted with dismay to the working group's
recommendations, which all but preclude the chances of a market
bill this year. Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, called them ``pitiful.''
   However, the SEC's move to stake out an independent position
pleased Democrats looking for a means to rekindle sentiment for
change.
   ``The SEC today distinguished itself from the do-nothing
strategists of the rest of this administration,'' said Rep. Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over the stock markets.
   ``The SEC has demonstrated intelligence, courage and common
sense,'' he said in a statement. Aides to Markey are drafting a
bill that would transfer jurisdiction of equity-related futures
from the commodity commission to the SEC.
   However, two members of the SEC do not want that authority.
Commission member Edward H. Fleischman argued that each commission
was best qualified to oversee the separate markets.
   ``We come from different backgrounds. ... We wear different
spectacles,'' he said.
   Commission member Joseph A. Grundfest said he agreed with the
goal of more consistent regulation, but said that seeking to take
over part of the commodity commission's jurisdiction would only
cause rancor and provoke a ``firestorm'' in Congress, where
separate committees oversee the two agencies.
   ``I think we could have and should have proceeded on the path of
cooperation. That could have gotten us a lot of what we wanted to
achieve. ... We have instead embarked on a path I would describe as
regulatory imperialism,'' he said.
   However, commission Chairman David S. Ruder said that SEC
control of stock and stock futures regulation flows logically from
the recommendations of an earlier presidential task force, composed
of members of the financial community. The so-called Brady task
force, headed by investment banker Nicholas F. Brady, said the
futures and stock markets are economically one.
   ``I think it's time we move to what I think is a rational way of
regulating that interlinked market,'' Ruder said. He was supported
by Commissioners Charles C. Cox and Aulana L. Peters.
   The SEC voted unanimously to offer four other recommendations to
Congress and decided to withhold one for futher discussion.
   In one, the SEC said it should have emergency power to call
trading halts, delay the opening of markets or close them early.
The commission would have to seek permission from the president of
the United States to continue a trading halt beyond 24 hours, and
the president would have the power to overturn any emergency action
by the SEC.
   If enacted, the emergency authority would reverse the current
arrangement, which requires the SEC to seek presidential permission
before calling a trading halt.
   The commission also asked for authority to require the reporting
of securities trades of larger than $5 million. That is intended to
make it easier for the agency to track index arbitrage, a form of
computer trading involving the simultaneous sale of large groups of
stocks and futures contracts.

   Here are highlights from the federal budget
for the 1989 fiscal year that the House approved Thursday by a
201-181 vote:
   _Overall spending: The government would get $1.232 trillion in
budget authority, which is the right to commit itself to that
amount of new spending programs. Of that, $1.099 trillion is for
outlays, the amount of money the government actually would spend
next year.
   _Revenues: $964 billion, including $14 billion in new taxes that
were enacted last December.
   _Deficit: The budget would create $135 billion in red ink. Under
the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, the maximum deficit allowable
for fiscal 1989 is $146 billion. Anything over that would trigger
automatic spending cuts in defense and many domstic programs.
   _Interest payments on the national debt: The government will
spend $152 billion this year paying interest on the $2.5 trillion
it currently owes.
   _Defense: $299.5 billion.
   _International affairs: $18.1 billion.
   _Science and space: $13 billion.
   _Environment: $15.8 billion.
   _Agriculture: $25.5 billion.
   _Transportation: $28.6 billion.
   _Education and job programs: $37.2 billion.
   _Health: $49.8 billion.
   _Medicare: $103.7 billion.
   _Social Security: $278.1 billion.
   _Veterans: $28.8 billion.
   _Justice: $8.9 billion.

<HEAD>Behind Arms Treaties Lie Difficulties In Monitoring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. intelligence satellites took months in 1983
to find a site in Siberia where the Soviets were building an early
warning radar system in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
   The incident illustrates the difficulties of monitoring arms
control deals, an issue at the heart of debate over the treaty
signed at the summit last December to eliminate medium-range
nuclear missiles.
   The discussion will become even more heated as the two sides
discuss a proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to slash longer
range arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Despite the unprecedented on-site inspection provisions of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force pact, to monitor it ``we are going
to rely about 95 percent on National Technical Means,'' or
satellites and listening stations, said former arms control
negotiator John Rhinelander.
   The task is complex, said the chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., because ``if you
are going to hide a missile, you are very unlikely to hide it in a
site where other side has the right of on-site inspection. You are
going to put it somewhere else where it is concealed.''
   On the question of test monitoring, a congressional scientific
study said Thursday that seismic technology is sensitive enough to
confidently monitor all but the smallest Soviet underground nuclear
tests.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are
expected to sign a pair of protocols designed to improve test
monitoring procedures.
   The study by the Office of Technology Assessment, an arm of
Congress, said ``seismology now provides a means to monitor
underground nuclear explosions down to low yields, even when
strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems.''
   But finding hidden missiles appears to be beyond the
capabilities of the two KH-11 photographic satellites the United
States is thought to have in orbit now.
   To fill the gap, Reagan on May 17 approved a compromise with
Boren, who had been seeking billions of dollars in additional money
over several years to boost the number and quality of U.S. spy
satellites.
   Soviet defectors, among them Alexei Myagov and Viktor Suvorov,
have said the Soviets track U.S. intelligence satellites and try to
fool them by covering up sensitive activities or by deploying dummy
armaments.
   And the Kremlin has made similar allegations about the United
States.
   In the 1970s, the Soviets were irked to find that U.S.
maintenance workers had covered Minutemen missile silos with tents,
blocking them from satellite inspection in violation of arms
control accords.
   ``The U.S. side said it was raining. Probably it was flooding,
because the tents stayed up for three months,'' said Valentin
Falin, a non-voting member of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee and frequent spokesman on U.S. relations.
   Falin, interviewed recently in Washington, cited the tent
incident as an example of the need for trust in verifying arms
control accords.
   Boren said the Soviets have ``little incentive to cheat'' on the
pact eliminating their 707 medium-range missiles, which are kept at
known sites.
   But, he said, ``when you get to START, where you are reducing
down by maybe 5,000 missiles, you have a much higher incentive to
cheat'' because of the difficulty in many kinds of weapons spread
across the Soviet Union.
   ``Our means are not adequate to cope with that kind of demand
without some substantial modernization and upgrading,'' Boren said
in an interview.
   The amount of the spending increase and the exact hardware
sought by Boren is classified, but he says, ``I am not just talking
numerically. I am talking qualitatively as well.''
   One likely improvement would be radar-imaging satellites, able
to peer through clouds and darkness.
   ``Remember our technical means are not just charged with
verifying arms control agreements,'' Boren said. ``We also have to
keep up with what is going on in around the world. We have other
needs,'' such as monitoring events in the Persian Gulf, keeping
track of conventional forces in Europe and around the globe, and
watching weapons tests.
   Former Intelligence Committee staff member Angelo Codevilla
argues that America needs more and better satellites to provide
targeting information on two new classes of Soviet mobile missiles,
the SS-24 and SS-25.
   ``What we have now is good for looking at places of known
interest with means that are themselves known and that have very
limited areas coverage,'' said Codevilla, now at the Hoover
Institute in California.
   In the 20 minutes it would take an ICBM to fly from America to
Russia, a mobile missile could be moved out of the intended blast
area.
   The United States, said Codevilla, needs to monitor Soviet
missile sites around the clock to be able to change the course of
missiles in flight.
   William Arkin of the Institute for Policy Analysis in
Washington, said that the overall product delivered by the
satellites ``is, in a nutshell, not very good.''
   The exchange of information between U.S. and Soviet negotiators
has produced far more information on Russian weapons systems than
intelligence collection, said Arkin.
   For example, before the exchange of data in the INF
negotiations, said Arkin, the Pentagon estimated the number of
SS-20s at 441 and the number of SS-23s at 20. Soviet data provided
last December put the figures at 405 SS-20s and 102 SS-23s,
including one battery never spotted by U.S. intelligence.

   The long Memorial Day weekend that begins today
may claim the lives of 380 to 480 people in traffic accidents, the
National Safety Council has estimated.
   The three-day holiday period begins at 6 p.m. today, local time,
and ends at midnight Monday for counting purposes.
   During last year's Memorial Day weekend, 416 people died in
traffic accidents, the Chicago-based council said Thursday.
   The worst Memorial Day traffic toll in the last quarter century
was recorded in 1968, when 629 people died. The lowest recorded
toll, in 1982, was 341.
   About 390 traffic deaths on U.S. roadways would be projected for
a non-holiday, three-day weekend this time of year, statistics
clerk Mary Johnston said Thursday.

<HEAD>Value Of Farm Exports To Reach Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New estimates by the Agriculture Department
put the value of U.S. agricultural exports at a four-year high of
$33.5 billion this fiscal year, up from $27.9 billion in 1986-87.
   Actual quantities of shipments may reach 145.5 million metric
tons, up from 129.2 million tons last year, the USDA said Thursday.
   Export values dropped to a decade low of $26.3 billion two years
ago but improved slightly to $27.9 billion in 1986-87. The tonnage
of shipments dropped to 109.5 million tons in 1985-86 before
recovering in 1986-87.
   Despite this year's gains, the current estimates are still far
below the record of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81
before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign
competition, a rising value of the U.S. dollar and other factors
triggered the slide.
   The new foreast also was up by $1 billion and 3 million tons
from USDA's previous estimate on Feb. 25.
   Officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal products,
horticultural products and soybeans. The boost in tonnage
``reflects improved prospects for wheat, feed ingredients and
soybeans,'' the report said.
   The value of animal products was boosted $600 million from the
February forecast to a record of $5.6 billion this year, due to
``stronger-than-expected demand for hides, red meats and animal
fats,'' the report said.
   ``Most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports
as the Export Enhancement Program and tighter competitor supplies
boost the U.S. share of world markets,'' the report said. ``Also,
higher prices are expected for grains, oilseeds and cotton.''
   Under the EEP arrangement, selected countries _ including the
Soviet Union and China _ have been getting wheat and other
designated commodities at prices subsidized by the U.S. government.
   Imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast
at a record $21 billion, up $500 million from the February
estimate. Last year's imports dropped slightly to $20.6 billion
from $20.9 billion in 1985-86, the previous high mark.
   But as a result of export values climbing more rapidly, the U.S.
agricultural trade balance _ the difference between exports and
imports _ is expected to rise sharply to $12.5 billion from $7.3
billion last year.
   However, the 1987-88 balance would still be far less than the
$19.1 billion edge U.S. farm exports had over imports in 1983-84.

   Ronald D. Plowman says he has no plans to
carry out a massive reorganization of the Agriculture Department's
primary science agency, the Agricultural Research Service.
   Plowman, who will collect an estimated $126,500 a year to head
up the agency, has been rumored as having been tabbed to revamp the
agency, including the pruning of a number of high-level jobs.
   But Plowman, who is head of the department of animal, dairy and
veterinary sciences at Utah State University, told The Associated
Press on Thursday that he has no such intentions.
   ``They've been reorganized to death,'' he said. ``We're going to
work with what we've got.''
   Plowman's USDA job appointment was announced on April 15 by
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng at a salary of $77,500 a year.
   It was subsequently disclosed, however, that Plowman _ who
retired from the USDA agency in 1984 after 27 years to go to work
for Utah State _ will be on loan from the university under a lawful
arrangement that will permit him to continue drawing his federal
retirement income, estimated at $35,000 a year. Additionally, he
will get $14,000 a year in per diem to help with relocation and the
higher costs of living in Washington.
   Technically, the university will pay Plowman's $77,500 salary as
head of the USDA agency, but the department then will reimburse
Utah State for that amount.
   However, if Plowman, 59, at some point in the future decides to
rejoin USDA permanently, he will have to give up his retirement
income, at least until retiring again from the federal government.

   A decision by the Agriculture Department to
loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production ``indicates the
United States intends to be a grain seller, not a grain storer,''
says the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers.
   Frank Johannsen, a Bayard, Neb., wheat farmer, referred in a
statement released Thursday to an earlier USDA announcement that
producers would be required to idle no more than 10 percent of
their wheat base acreage to qualify for 1989 program benefits. The
acreage set-aside was 27.5 percent for 1988.
   But Johannsen said the smaller land-idling requirement
``requires a continuing federal commitment'' to operate the Export
Enchancement Program, or EEP, which has helped reduce surplus U.S.
wheat stockpiles.
   Under EEP, selected foreign countries _ including the Soviet
Union and China _ have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at
subsidized prices.
   ``We intend to work closely with USDA and the Congress to see
that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and
that the past oversupply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur,'' he
said.
   ``For 50 years _ and often to its detriment _ the United States
has held virtually all the world's surplus grain,'' Johannsen
added. ``With the 1989 wheat program, we shift that burden to our
competitors.''

   Fourteen years ago Anna Rosnovsky and
her sister Elena Keiss-Kuna applied together to leave the Soviet
Union. Only one got out.
   The other's struggle for an emigration visa is a poignant symbol
of the human rights issue to be raised in the Moscow summit next
week.
   In separate interviews, the two sisters sounded the same note of
skepticism about the Soviet commitment to improve conditions for
Soviet Jews, despite sharply rising emigration figures.
   ``We are hostages. We are like goods for sale in the political
negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Mrs.
Keiss-Kuna, 46, said in an interview in Leningrad last month.
   ``Gorbachev sells human rights. But it is not cheap for him,''
said Mrs. Rosnovsky, 48, who brought her campaign on behalf of her
sister to Helsinki on Thursday.
   President Reagan is in Helsinki until Sunday to rest and prepare
for the summit. Mrs. Rosnovsky, an Israeli, came to the Finnish
capital as part of a delegation sponsored by the U.S. National
Conference on Soviet Jewry to draw public attention to the issue.
   Mrs. Keiss-Kuna's name is on a list, which includes as many as
300 Soviet Jews, that the United States want to bring to the
attention of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Mrs.
Rosnovsky, a violinist with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra.
   She showed a reporter a March 1 letter from Secretary of State
George P. Shultz in which Shultz pledged ``to persist in our
efforts to make the Soviets live up to their human rights
obligations.'' But he cautioned: ``I cannot offer you any specific
encouragement in the case of your family.''
   She said that on Monday her sister and another Leningrad
activist were stopped from boarding a train for Moscow, where they
were invited to meet Reagan along with several dozen other
``refuseniks,'' or Jews denied exit visas.
   Two Soviet officers ``followed her to the train and then took
her to the police (station)'' where she was detained for three
hours. ``Now they follow her all the time,'' said Mrs. Rosnovsky.
She said she spoke to her sister Wednesday by telephone.
   ``She's not a soldier. She's just a woman ... But she's
stubborn. She will fight,'' said Mrs. Rosnovsky.
   Last month 1,086 Jews left the Soviet Union, the highest monthly
figure in seven years. But it fell far short of the 1979 peak level
when about 4,000 departed every month.
   The Israeli government has said about 400,000 of the three
million Soviet Jews took initial steps toward emigration, but only
a few thousand followed through with formal visa requests.
   Mrs. Keiss-Kuna last month said she was denied permission to
leave because she worked as a radio engineer and could possess
sensitive knowledge. She calls the authorities' continued refusal
to let her leave ``absurd'' since she was fired from her job 13
years ago.
   Mrs. Keiss-Kuna asserted that the improvement in emigration was
part of Gorbachev's efforts to improve his image without changing
his repressive policies.
   ``He is very, very clever to get so much good publicity for such
little steps,'' she said. ``It is very easy to take a few steps
with Jewish people. everybody knows the support we have, so they
(the Soviets) made some steps and everybody applauded.'
   Mrs. Rosnovsky has been battling for her family every since she
left them behind in 1974.
   She said her father was allowed to leave in 1976 following the
intervention of Golda Meir, then retired as Israeli prime minister,
with contacts in the Socialist Internationale. Her mother spent
more than three years in a psychiatric prison, but was released a
few years ago and came to Israel.

   A West German surgeon believed to be the first
in the world to repair livers outside the body says the procedure
offers a temporary reprieve for victims of one of the bleakest
forms of cancer.
   ``It's the best possible retaliation (against cancer) for these
patients, and they are improved dramatically,'' said Dr. Rudolf
Pichlmayr of the University of Hannover Medical School.
   Pichlmayr said Thursday he has performed out-of-body liver
operations three times, including twice this month. There was no
other option for the patients, two women and a man suffering from
malignant liver tumors, he said.
   In each case, Pichlmayr removed the liver, worked on it for four
to five hours, then put it back in tumor-free.
   All three patients are doing well, although it's likely the
tumors will reappear, Pichlmayr said.
   ``It's the fate of all tumor patients. But we surgeons have to
do our utmost to take care'' of them, he said in a telephone
interview from West Germany.
   Pichlmayr said he is giving the patients time and perhaps a
chance for a longer life. He said he's also giving them hope.
   ``That's a very important reason,'' he said. ``We've improved
the quality of life very much.''
   Until Pichlmayr's efforts, so-called bench surgery had involved
only kidneys, a well-established procedure to correct vessel
problems or remove cysts and benign tumors. Kidneys are less
delicate than livers and a patient can do without them longer.
   ``It represents a very interesting and positive step,'' said the
University of Pittsburgh's Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the
world's first liver transplant in 1967.
   ``My hat's off to him. It's a monumental effort,'' said Dr. John
S. Najarian of the University of Minnesota.
   Najarian said he has transplanted donor livers into four
patients with cancerous liver tumors. Only one is still alive.
Unlike Pichlmayr's patients, there was no evidence the cancer had
spread at the time of surgery.
   ``You're just buying time,'' Najarian said.
   Liver cancer is among the more deadlier forms of the disease,
said Frank Mahaney, a spokesman for the National Cancer Institute.
If detected early, patients have a 10 percent to 30 percent chance
of surviving five years. If not, they have a mere 3 percent chance.
   Pichlmayr first performed out-of-body liver surgery Feb. 5 on a
40-year-old woman whose liver had more than doubled in weight
because of tumors.
   He considered transplanting a new liver into the woman, but
ruled it out because he believed her cancer had spread, and that it
would have been a waste of one of the scarce donor organs.
   Pichlmayr also decided against the conventional method of
removing the cancerous sections of the liver while it remained in
the body because of the tumor's size and central location.
   Pichlmayr, who described the procedure in a West German medical
journal in April, removed the woman's liver by cutting and clamping
its numerous vessels. He connected two main veins to a pump that
served as a bypass and kept the blood coursing though her body.
   After five hours and 19 minutes outside the body, the liver was
reinserted as a transplanted organ is. The woman has since returned
home, Pichlmayr said.
   ``She's gained weight again and at this moment she's very
healthy,'' he said. ``She was suffering extremely, and I think she
would not be alive now.''
   Pichlmayr performed the operation again May 6 on a 48-year-old
woman and May 11 on a 58-year-old man.
   ``The lady is at home, quite well,'' he said. ``The man is still
in the hospital, but is good.''
   Three days before his first out-of-body liver surgery, Pichlmayr
performed the world's first split-liver transplant, in which one
donor organ was divided and each half transplanted into separate
patients.

<HEAD>Noriega Says U.S. Ultimatum Forced Collapse In Talks On His
Removal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told a
packed National Assembly session that the United States'
take-it-or-leave-it attitude forced the collapse of talks about his
leaving power.
   ``The world must know that the conversation sustained with the
envoy of President Reagan broke down when he presented us with an
ultimatum in which Panama had to immediately accept his last
offer,'' Noriega said.
   ``I know it and I say so because I was there. (U.S. Secretary of
State) George Shultz wasn't there,'' Noriega said in his speech
Thursday to a cheering crowd in the 500-seat assembly chamber.
   Outside the chamber of the 67-member assembly, hundreds of
people listened to his words through a loudspeaker.
   Noriega, who commands Panama's 15,000-strong Defense Forces and
is his country's de facto leader, did not elaborate. Shultz on
Wednesday announced the breakdown of talks and blamed Noriega.
   The general said Thursday that Panama had accepted several U.S.
proposals, but added: ``Even this wasn't sufficient. The United
States desired an ultimatum.''
   In exchange for Noriega's stepping down, the Reagan
administration had offered to lift economic sanctions it imposed on
Panama after the general was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking
charges in February.
   It also offered to have the indictments dismissed.
   The White House still recognizes the presidency of Eric Arturo
Delvalle, whom the Noriega-dominated National Assembly deposed Feb.
26 after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   Noriega appeared before the assembly to answer questions about
what the government insists on calling ``conversations,'' not
negotiations, on a possible arrangement under which he would
relinquish power.
   Asked whether his resignation had been discussed, the general
replied: ``The commander doesn't abandon his ship in stormy
weather.''
   Noriega said Panama has become a pawn for U.S. political
candidates and charged them with ``using the flag of Panama in
whatever way is convenient for them.''
   He said some candidates want ``to bury files that weigh on their
shoulders,'' but did not explain.
   Vice President George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, has been accused of having detailed knowledge of Noriega's
alleged links to Colombian cocaine traffickers before the general
was indicted.
   Bush denies the allegations.
   Noriega on Thursday repeated his conditions for stepping down:
Extra troops sent to U.S. bases in Panama must be withdrawn and the
position of Manuel Solis Palma, who took over as president after
Delvalle's ouster, must be guaranteed.
   Earlier, Solis Palma told a women's organization that U.S.
negotiators told Noriega in March to be out of the country in 48
hours or face the consequences. When Noriega refused, Solis Palma
said, the Americans softened their manner. He did not elaborate on
what was meant by ``consequences.''
   Solis Palma said the final U.S. offer was to drop the drug
charges against Noriega in return for his giving up command of the
Defense Forces on Aug. 12 and leaving Panama in September.
   He said the United States also had promised to release $50
million in Panamanian assets frozen in American banks if a national
unity Cabinet was chosen that picked a president ``who could not be
Solis Palma.''
   Meanwhile, President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala offered to
mediate a solution to the impasse.
   Cerezo told reporters in Guatemala City on Thursday that Panama
is experiencing ``a radicalization against the United States that
is dangerous for the region and that moreover is causing grave
damages to the Panamanian nation.''
   He said he had spoken with U.S. and Panamanian officials on
``the possibility of a plan aimed at finding a space for dialogue
in Panama to consolidate a democratic process.''
   Cerezo met on Thursday with James Michel, the U.S. ambassador to
Guatemala. Cerezo also told reporters he recently held
conversations with Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of Panama's
opposition Christian Democrats.
   Arias Calderon said Thursday that the U.S. negotiators failed to
strike a deal with Noriega because of a growing division in the
Panamanian military of which the United States was not aware.
   ``Errors by the United States were not the only factor although
they were a factor,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecution Hits Unprecedented Tangle</HEAD>

   To convince a jury that the government
authorized his role in the Iran-Contra affair, businessman Richard
V. Secord may want to question Oliver L. North about his
congressional testimony on the subject.
   To show jurors that his direction of an aid program for the
Nicaragua Contras was sanctioned despite a congressional ban, North
may want to ask John M. Poindexter about his congressional
statements on the operation.
   Like his one-time business partner Secord, businessman Albert
Hakim may need to use North's testimony during a trial.
   Normally, a defendant can try to prove his innocence in a
criminal conspiracy trial by questioning a co-defendant about his
prior statements.
   But the Iran-Contra case has developed an apparently
unprecedented legal tangle that could make it impossible for the
defendants to exercise that right.
   The dilemma is so serious that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell said Thursday it may be impossible to prosecute the
defendants on the conspiracy charges that form the heart of the
case.
   The testimony of defendants North, a former National Security
Council staffer; Poindexter, the ex-national security adviser; and
Hakim was given to joint congressional committees under a grant of
limited immunity from prosecution.
   Secord, a retired Air Force office, did not testify under
immunity, but he has filed legal briefs contending the immunized
testimony of North could prove his innocence.
   The immunity grant to three defendants means independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh cannot use the immunized testimony against them,
and he would be precluded from using it against Secord if all four
are tried together.
   But left unclear Thursday was whether the defendants could
question each other about the congressional testimony.
   ``As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try the
conspiracy counts in the context'' of rules on immunity, Gesell
said. ``If you try them together you violate the immunities.''
   But Gesell added that trying the defendants separately ``makes a
conspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of the other's
testimony.''
   The judge said he did not want to conduct four separate trials
under a separation motion sought by the defense. ``Four individual
trials is ridiculous,'' he said.
   He added that he ``searched hard to find a case _ and I haven't
found one _ where it's fair to say that three of four defendants
have been broadly immunized by governmental action.''
   Gesell made no ruling on the immunity issue, but said he hoped
to resolve the matter and other defense motions by the end of June.
   The judge scheduled a closed hearing for June 13 to determine if
any lawyers for the State, Justice and Defense Departments, the
White House and CIA used the defendants' immunized testimony to
prepare officials for questioning by Walsh's grand jury.
   Gesell said he wanted to determine if any of the many government
officials Walsh intends to call as trial witnesses were influenced
by immunized statements made by the defendants.
   Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge representing Walsh,
said the immunity grants won't prevent a fair trial.
   If Secord wants to question North about his congressional
testimony, ``all General Secord has to do is ask Colonel North for
the same facts, and out it comes,'' Stern said.
   Defense lawyer Barry Simon argued that most of the witnesses
Walsh intends to call at trial were so influenced by the immunized
statements ``you can't unscramble from what the witnesses know now,
having seen, read and analyzed that testimony, from what they knew
before.''
   The four defendants are charged with conspiring to corrupt the
sale of U.S. arms to Iran by diverting profits to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua during a time when Congress banned U.S. military aid
to them.
   The four are also are charged with theft of government property
and wire fraud in connection with the alleged diversion.
   In addition, North and Poindexter are charged with making false
statements and obstructing investigations by Congress and Attorney
General Edwin Meese III into covert assistance given the Contras.

<HEAD>Government Scientists Plan Acid Rain Study in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government scientists are planning to spend a
month studying the skies over Illinois to learn how much effect
summer storms have on acid rain.
   The project, which will start on June 1 and continue for four
weeks, will use both radar and airborne measurements to see how
long and how far storms carry pollutants, said William J. Brennan
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``If you're going to get a handle on pollutants that are put
into the atmosphere and what their impact will be downwind, you
have to know what happens to them aloft,'' Brennan said Thursday.
   ``How much of the pollutants fall out within a 10- or 20- or
50-mile range of the source?'' he asked. ``How much of it gets
carried aloft and moved further along? What are the conditions that
cause it to either fall out early on or get carried along for some
distance? A scientist always has to know why.''
   Brennan said that the study being undertaken by his agency, the
Department of Energy, federal research laboratories, several
universities and the Illinois Water Survey will provide ``a body of
knowledge from which the policymakers can reach decisions on acid
rain.''
   During the four-week study based at Willard Field in Champaign,
Ill., one team of scientists will use flying laboratories to see
how storms redistribute pollutants, while another team will use a
new radar technique to observe the movement of pollution in the
troposphere, seven to 10 miles above the ground, Brennan said.
   He said a team from the oceanic and atmospheric administration's
Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., will be conducting a related
study to test two kinds of Doppler radars, one for monitoring
upper-level winds and the other for winds near the surface.
   At the same time, the Illinois Water Survey will use its
rainfall-collection network to determine how much pollution is
contained in rainfall from local storms.

<HEAD>EPA Adds 100 Counties To List That Might Need Pollution Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is telling more
suburbanites that urban air pollution could be spreading their way
and they might have to accept new controls.
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday designated more
than 100 additional counties that must be considered in drawing up
new plans to control air pollution, mostly in urban areas.
   Most of the counties are on the edges of 107 metropolitan and
rural areas already designated as failing to meet federal standards
for ozone, carbon monoxide or both.
   Not all the new counties are suburban. Nantucket County,
Massachusetts, an island 30 miles off Cape Cod, was added to the
list of those that must be considered when new carbon monoxide
control plans are drafted by the state.
   The counties were picked not because their air is polluted _ in
most of them there are no measurements _ but because census data
suggest they could be contributing to area-wide pollution, such as
through heavy auto commuting.
   Some counties will be dropped as planning goes forward, but
those that remain could find their industries facing additional
controls and their residents required to submit their cars for
pollution inspections.
   ``Clearly what I'm doing is not sufficient to deal with the
problem,'' EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told a news conference.
   Thomas said he was doing nothing that would pre-empt
congressional revisions to the Clean Air Act aimed at eventual
compliance with federal standards, something originally expected in
1977.
   He said, as he had before, he hoped Congress would tell him what
to do next. But if Congress does not act by Aug. 31, when an
eight-month prohibition on sanctions against recalcitrant areas
expires, Thomas said he will require states to come up with new
controls, as he outlined last November.
   EPA had planned to forbid construction of major new pollution
sources in 14 cities when Congress temporarily barred the action
last December.
   EPA lists 68 areas as failing to meet federal ozone standards
and 59 as not meeting carbon monoxide standards, with 20 not
meeting both. Thursday's decision adds 125 counties to the 225
counties in the ozone areas and 115 counties to the 96 counties in
the carbon monoxide areas. There is some overlap in the two lists
of counties.
   Thursday's designations came in expected formal notices to 44
state governors and the mayor of the District of Columbia that EPA
was disapproving air pollution control plans, or revoking previous
approvals, for the non-complying ozone and carbon monoxide areas.
   Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa and Vermont
have no non-complying areas and are not affected.
   States have 60 days to submit schedules to complete new plans,
which can take two years; to fulfill promises in old plans; to
begin new assessments of actual pollution as opposed to computer
estimates; and to add monitors where EPA says they're needed.

<HEAD>Rent Voucher Program to Be Extended to Rural Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some rural families will soon be able to take
advantage of a federal program that is helping 110,000 urban
residents pay their rent, sometimes with cash left over for the
renter.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce
announced Thursday that HUD's housing voucher program was being
extended into 50 public housing districts in 13 states.
   Initially, the program will aid only 2,178 rural families, but
officials say they hope it can be expanded to other housing
districts and states. HUD has asked for funding to issue an
additional 100,000 vouchers in fiscal 1989.
   The largest numbers of rural vouchers will be available in
Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan, according to Pierce's
announcement.
   James Schoenberger, deputy federal housing commissioner, said
areas in those states and in nine others were chosen because they
had public housing authorities that appear most ready to set up the
rural programs in cooperation with the Farmers Home Administration.
   The voucher program, which began as an experimental alternative
to public housing in 1984, became permanent under a law signed by
President Reagan earlier this year.
   Qualified low-income families may be given housing vouchers
worth the difference between 30 percent of their family income and
the local ``payment standard'' for adequate housing in the area
where they live. Officials said that HUD expects to be funding more
single-family dwellings in rural communities than it does in
cities, where most recipients live in apartments.
   The program contains what HUD officials call a ``shopping
incentive,'' allowing renters to rent whatever kind of housing they
want, rather than limiting them to public housing projects.
   ``We think it's a program with a great amount of sensitivity to
it,'' Schoenberger said.
   He said that the vouchers allow people to receive aid without
subjecting themselves to the social problems that often plague
public housing projects.
   In a typical situation under either the rural or urban programs:
   A family might be earning $10,000 a year, meaning that it would
be expected to pay 30 percent of its income or $3,000 in rent. If
HUD determines the ``payment standard'' for an adequate unit for
the family to be $5,000, the family would receive vouchers worth
$2,000 a year.
   Recipients then can decide whether they want to pay $5,000 and
use all of the voucher, stay in a $3,000 unit and use the
additional funds for other needs, or pay more than $5,000 to
further improve their lifestyle.
   In public housing, renters don't see any of the assistance given
by the government. Under the voucher program, an arrangement can be
made to return money to the renters if they can find a unit that
rents for less than the subsidy.
   Schoenberger said that there already may be a line of applicants
for the rural vouchers in some housing authorites, but in others,
there could be an ``opportunity to pretty much walk into the door
and take advantage of it.''
   Under the program, select Mississippi housing authorities will
assist 441 famlies; Kentucky, 422 families; Missouri, 380;
Michigan, 225; and Georgia, 130. New Hampshire, Vermont, Oklahoma
and Washington will each be allowed 100 vouchers, while Montana,
North Dakota and Idaho will each serve 50 rural families, and
Louisiana will help 30.

   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings said he
remains confident that a House subcommittee will refuse to
recommend that he be impeached on charges of conspiring to solicit
a bribe.
   On Thursday, at the end of five days of hearings before the
House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, Hastings said:
``I haven't heard anything new so far. These are old charges. They
all came up in my trial.''
   Asked how he would assess the hearings to date, Hastings
replied: ``Hastings five, Congress nothing.''
   The subcommittee hearings will continue next Wednesday.
   Hastings, who still sits on the federal bench in Miami, has been
accused by an investigative panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta of taking part in a bribery scheme with his
close friend, Washington lawyer William A. Borders.
   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe for
Hastings from two Miami racketeers, Frank and Tom Romano, in
exchange for a promise of lenient sentences. One year later, a
separate trial jury acquitted Hastings of conspiring with Borders
to solicit a bribe from the Romano brothers.
   Hastings is also charged with compromising an FBI investigation
into zoning code corruption in the Miami area in 1985.
   Earlier, FBI agent William J. Murphy Jr., who directed the
Hastings-Borders investigation, testified at Thursday's
subcommittee hearing
   that Hastings was a target from the beginning of the probe.
   Murphy also said that Hastings and Borders weren't illegally
lured into taking the bribe even though an undercover FBI agent
gave $120,000 to Borders before he was arrested on Oct. 9, 1981.
   Murphy said the FBI began the investigation after an informant,
William Dredge, had bragged that he controlled several judges,
including Hastings and another federal jurist who was not
identified.
   He said the undercover operation took place because ``we were
only trying to prove or disprove what (Dredge) said.''
   In answer to a question, Murphy said Hastings ``was a target
from the outset. His name was mentioned by Borders. We tried to
prove or disprove the allegation and it turned out to be true.''
   Rep. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., said that the FBI's undercover
operation appeared to him to be ``a classic, textbook entrapment.''
   Saying he was not an attorney, Murphy replied that he did not
believe it was entrapment. He said the operation ``was a tool to
respond to (Dredge's) allegations. If Borders didn't show up at the
meeting and didn't say the things he did, the case would have
stopped.
   ``The information we were trying to prove or disprove was that
Borders and Judge Hastings were going to do a crime,'' Murphy said.
``We didn't decide one day in the office to get Judge Hastings.''

<HEAD>Democrats Agree to Drop Contested Plan to Ban AIDS Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats pushing for expanded AIDS testing
and counseling say they had to drop a bitterly contested provision
protecting AIDS victims from discrimination to get their bill
moving.
   The bill, which provides $400 million next year and each of the
following two years for AIDS testing, won voice vote approval on
Thursday from the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee.
The measure now goes to the full Energy and Commerce Committee for
a vote, probably early next month. A similar bill is pending in a
Senate committee.
   The bill was welcomed by some in the gay community, even without
the ban on discrimination, because of its provisions for counseling
and confidentiality of test results. ``Even without the
non-discrimination provision, it's worth having,'' said Jeffrey
Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   Subcommittee chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said that the
anti-discrimination provision was dropped because ``unfortunately,
that policy is caught up in such controversy that we will not be
able to pursue it at this time,''
   Asked what went into the decision to drop it, an aide replied,
``Counting votes.''
   Waxman and Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said that they hoped they
could eventually win a ban on discrimination against AIDS victims
and carriers.
   The discrimination ban not only would protect AIDS victims, but
also encourage voluntary testing, Wyden said, because ``many
Americans will be reluctant to come forward for voluntary testing
if they are then open to blatant discrimination on the basis of the
results.''
   ``We've got to keep pushing. That's the one key missing part,''
he added.
   Wyden and Waxman said that federal laws and policies clearly
state that discrimination by the federal government and its
contractors is not allowed. But ``there are some real questions
about the private sector,'' Wyden said.
   The bill authorizes new and expanded testing programs run by
states, localities and private groups. Testing would have to be
voluntary and accompanied by counseling. Anonymous testing and use
of pseudonyms would be permitted to the extent possible under state
laws.
   Under the measure, health professionals or others who violated
confidentiality standards outlined in the bill, intentionally or
negligently, could be fined up to $10,000 for each offense.
   On its third and final day of deliberations Thursday, the
subcommittee agreed to an amendment saying that money in the bill
cannot be used for counseling ``that promotes or encourages,
directly, homosexual or unsafe heterosexual activity or intravenous
substance abuse.'' The amendment also says that counselors must
supply ``the most current scientific knowledge available ...
provided that any informational materials used are not obscene.''
   The amendment arose after conservatives in Congress complained
that the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, which receives
federal money, produced an educational comic book and videotape
that explicitly depicted homosexual acts.
   The panel also approved amendments requiring testing of people
convicted of intravenous drug use, prostitution or a crime related
to sexual assault, and making it a crime for a person to contribute
to a blood bank or have sexual relations if he knows he has AIDS or
carries the AIDS virus.
   Amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and
hospital patients were rejected. The subcommittee also refused to
require that public health authorities be given the names,
addresses and phone numbers of people who don't have AIDS but test
positive for the virus that causes it.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is transmitted
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring. There is no known cure for the disease, which damages
the body's immune system.

<HEAD>House Members Lash Out at `Zero Tolerance' Drug Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Customs Service blames
the public outcry over the new federal ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug
policy on wealthy Americans whose boats are being seized by the
government.
   Customs Commissioner William von Raab, in his first appearance
before Congress since the policy began, said Thursday that seizures
of vessels at sea after discoveries of miniscule amounts of illegal
drugs were affecting ``arrogant stock brokers and smooth lawyers
who think they're above the law.''
   Von Raab told members of the House Coast Guard and navigation
subcommittee that complaints were coming from ``rich people who
have a lot of pull with the media, who have a lot of pull with
Congress.''
   The policy, he said, ``is supported by the American people.''
   Joining von Raab was Admiral Paul A. Yost Jr., commandant of the
Coast Guard, who disputed lawmakers' complaints that his service
was squandering money from its already tight budget.
   Yost told the legislators that the arrests and seizures were
occurring only during routine patrols and inspections, saying, ``I
am not wasting resources in this policy.''
   Most members of the subcommittee, however, rejected the
officials' claims and insisted that zero tolerance was a case of an
overzealous government going too far.
   ``In the minds of the public, this is a government policy gone
awry,'' said Rep. Robert W. Davis of Michigan, the panel's ranking
Republican. ``It symbolizes unfairness.''
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., was one of
several lawmakers who complained that the seizure of fishing boats
after crewmen were found to have tiny amounts of drugs was
depriving innocent owners of a means to earn a living.
   ``Innocent persons are being hurt more than users,'' he said.
   Some members of the panel engaged von Raab in heated exchanges.
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, complained to the Customs official
about a small boat seized in Alaska after paraphernalia such as
rolling paper and rolling machines were discovered.
   Young said that such implements could be perfectly innocent and
told von Raab, ``You're not helping the cause here at all. In fact,
you're hurting it.''
   Under the policy, Customs and Coast Guard officers finding small
amounts of illegal drugs during searches conducted at sea have
begun arresting people and seizing boats.
   The new procedures have resulted in the temporary seizure of
such boats as the Atlantis II, owned by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts, after a crewman was
found to have a tiny amount of marijuana.
   In addition, the $2.5 million yacht Ark Royal and the Monkey
Business _ the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate
Gary Hart sailed on with model Donna Rice _ were seized after small
quantities of drugs were discovered.
   Under new guidelines issued late last week, authorities finding
small amounts of drugs on board vessels beyond the 12-mile limit
now are seizing boats only if they appear to be involved in
transporting drugs into the country.
   Some lawmakers defended the policy.
   Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif., conceded that zero tolerance needs
adjustments but said he believed the policy is sound.
   Rep. Bob Clement, D-Tenn., said, ``My constituents want a tough
policy, and that policy is that no amount of drugs is OK.''
   Von Raab said that the Customs Service has made 1,500 seizures _
mostly of automobiles crossing into the United States _ since zero
tolerance took effect. Yost said 44 boats have so far been seized,
13 of which have already been released.
   The Customs Service implemented the policy on March 21, and the
Coast Guard followed suit on April 11.

<HEAD>House GOP Rebuffed in Effort to Renew Military Aid to Contras</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Republicans staged a legislative ambush
in an attempt to renew military aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels,
but were rebuffed amid fears that such a move would upset delicate
negotiations in Managua.
   In a surprise move, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., sought Thursday to
amend an intelligence bill to permit President Reagan to dip into
the CIA's contingency fund to finance future covert military aid to
the rebels. The measure was defeated, 214-190.
   Since 1983, the law authorizing intelligence operations has
contained a prohibition on use of the spy agency's contingency fund
to buy weapons and other supplies for the Contras. The ban was
imposed after lawmakers became angered at the CIA's role in aiding
the Nicaraguan war.
   Hyde's amendment would have dropped the prohibition from the
law. At present, the rebels can receive only humanitarian aid _
food, clothing and medicine _ from the United States under a $17.7
million program approved by Congress earlier this year.
   Proponents of the move argued that things have gone badly for
the rebels since Congress voted earlier this year to end military
aid. The two sides are nearing the end of a two-month truce agreed
to during talks at Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   The Contra supporters said that the Nicaraguan government has
taken advantage of the cease-fire to weaken the rebels and has
failed to live up to promises made in a regional peace accord
reached last year. Instead, they argued, the Sandinistas have
harassed peaceful anti-government demonstrators, arrested labor
leaders and denied press freedom.
   Giving Reagan the power to resume covert military aid any time
after Oct. 1 would add pressure for the Managua regime to release
political prisoners, restore civil liberties and hold free
elections, supporters of the amendment argued.
   Opponents of the move noted that a new round of negotiations
between the two warring sides was taking place in Managua and said
that there was still hope that a lasting peace could be achieved.
   ``I cannot think of a more pernicious, ill-timed amendment,''
said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich. ``At the very minute that the
Contras, who have struggled for three weeks to put their own act
together, ... meet with the government of Nicaragua, an amendment
is offered to put the CIA back into this war.''
   In another attempt to pressure the Sandinistas, a group of
conservative lawmakers announced plans to seek new military aid for
the rebels if the Managua government fails to meet its obligations
under the peace accord by the time the formal truce ends on May 31.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., while declining to give precise figures,
said the package would include substantial military and
humanitarian aid, sufficient to last the Contras a year to 18
months.

<HEAD>Gore Would Bring Southern Strength To Democratic Ticket</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of occasional profiles of vice presidential
prospects.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. remains on the
list of possible Democratic candidates for the vice presidency
despite calling the job a ``political dead end'' when he was
seeking the No. 1 spot on the ticket.
   Gore's prospects of joining the ticket declined in the
estimation of some Democrats as a result of his attacks on both
Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis in the final weeks of his
presidential campaign.
   He would bring to the ticket, however, credentials as a
Southerner with proven popularity in the region.
   Gore ended his 1988 presidential hopes after the New York
primary in April, his campaign a failure outside of the region-wide
victories in the Super Tuesday primaries.
   At 40 the youngest of the potential vice presidential nominees,
Gore remains in the speculation in part because of those Southern
successes.
   Some observers contend that Dukakis, the likely Democratic
presidential nominee, needs a Southerner on the ticket if he is to
carry any states in the region that is often crucial to Democratic
electoral strategy. Other Southerners getting frequent mention are
Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Bob Graham of Florida and Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas.
   Gore insisted throughout his campaign that he had no interest in
the No. 2 job. He did not flatly rule it out, however.
   ``I have no interest in it _ might very well turn it down,
indeed, and probably would,'' he said once.
   ``I think Vice President Bush will demonstrate again this year
that it is a political dead end,'' Gore said.
   Gore met privately with Dukakis recently. Dukakis insists he is
not considering the selection of a running mate until he has
collected a majority of convention delegates.
   Gore has nearly 400 Democratic National Convention delegates. He
has asked them to remain committed to him, but he has been losing
delegates nearly daily to Dukakis.
   When his presidential hopes reached a stage of desperation, Gore
turned up his attacks on Dukakis and accused him of foreign-policy
blunders born of inexperience and lack of knowledge.
   He turned attacks on Jackson, too, on foreign policy _ and
blasted Dukakis as ``afraid to say a single word about Jesse
Jackson.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch backed Gore and picked up the
criticism of Jackson with a vengeance. Gore aides were dismayed by
Koch's attacks. Even Gore seemed to cringe, although he did not
take public issue with his newfound supporter.
   Gore is the son of a veteran Tennessee politician, Albert Gore
Sr., who spent 32 years in the House and Senate before losing his
seat in 1970, with his opposition to the Vietnam War an issue. Gore
Jr. enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam.
   He was born and educated in Washington, D.C., attending the
elite St. Albans prep school and then Harvard. His wife, Tipper,
was a high school sweetheart, and she has become well-known in her
own right for leading public crusades against violent and sexually
explicit lyrics in music aimed at young people.
   Gore worked as a newspaper reporter in Nashville, Tenn., and
entered both divinity school and law school, not completing either.
He quit law school after two years when the House seat his father
once held came open, and won election in 1976.
   He won election to the Senate in 1984, when Republican Howard
Baker declined to run again.
   Although he has a congressional voting record decidedly more
liberal than some of Tennessee's other members of Congress, Gore
positioned himself in the presidential race to the right of most
other Democratic contenders.

<HEAD>Latest ABC-Post Poll Gives Dukakis 13-Point Lead Over Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
front-runner, holds a 13-point lead over Republican nominee-to-be
George Bush, according to a poll published today.
   Dukakis leads Bush 53 percent to 40 percent, the survey by The
Washington Post and ABC News indicates.
   The poll also found that the vice president's unfavorability
rating is nearly four times as great as that of Dukakis. Bush is
viewed unfavorably by 37 percent and Dukakis by 10 percent, the
newspaper said.
   The Massachusetts governor is favorably rated by 67 percent of
those surveyed, to 50 percent for the vice president.
   The survey also indicated that the ``gender gap'' plays a part
in Dukakis' lead at this stage. Among women voters, Dukakis holds a
2-1 lead, 61 percent to 33 percent. Bush has the advantage among
male voters, but only of 4 percentage points, the newspaper said.
   The survey of 1,172 randomly selected registered voters
nationwide also suggested, however, that the support of both
candidates is ``soft'' and could easily shift between now and the
November election.
   Dukakis' edge over Bush widened when compared to a similar
Post-ABC poll conducted in March. In that survey, Dukakis had a
5-point lead. Several other polls conducted in recent weeks have
given Dukakis a double-digit lead.
   According to the Post, 57 percent of the Dukakis supporters said
they backed the Massachusetts governor largely because they don't
want Bush to become president. The Post noted that Bush has the
backing of most Reagan supporters, but said that Reagan's
disapproval rating stands at 46 percent.
   On specific issues, the Post-ABC survey indicated that Bush has
a 2-1 edge when the two are compared on the topic of national
defense, and scored a bit better than Dukakis on fighting inflation
and keeping taxes down. But on virtually all other issues, Dukakis
was ahead.
   The Democratic contender was seen as likely to do better at
keeping the United States out of war, helping the poor (by a large
margin), reducing the drug problem, protecting the Social Security
system and keeping unemployment down. Dukakis was also given an
edge in issues like providing leadership, reducing the threat of
nuclear war, bringing down the deficit and maintaining high ethical
and moral standards in his administration.
   The Dukakis camp has played down the recent favorable poll
results. The Bush campaign, however, has reacted to the surveys by
pointing out that the election is months away and the situation
could change dramatically once the two have secured their
respective parties' nominations and are campaigning directly
against one another.
   The telephone interviews for the survey were conducted from May
19 to May 26. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rates Highest In Northeast, Lowest Out West</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Heart Disease-List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you live in New York, your chances of dying
from a heart attack may be twice as great as in New Mexico,
according to a study that finds ``significant'' geographic
differences in heart-disease death rates.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
heart-disease rates were generally highest in concentrated,
urbanized areas of the Northeast or Midwest, while the West had the
lowest rates.
   ``We're talking about thousands of deaths difference between the
low states and the high states,'' said Dr. Patrick L. Remington, a
CDC researcher.
   Heart disease is the leading killer in the United States, taking
more lives each year than all other causes combined, according to
the American Heart Association. In 1985, 540,800 Americans died of
ischemic, or blocked-artery, heart disease _ most commonly heart
attacks, according to CDC statistics.
   Remington said the stress of urbanization itself is probably not
to blame for the high rates in the densely populated Northeast and
Midwest, but many people in those regions probably have lifestyles
that could lead to more heart attacks.
   ``Just living in a big city doesn't appear to be a risk
factor,'' he said. ``But more desk jobs, and greater reliance on
automobiles, all are part of a sedentary lifestyle that contributes
to greater risk of a heart attack.''
   He said lack of exercise contributes to weight gain, higher
cholesterol levels, stress and high blood pressure _ all factors in
heart disease.
   ``Lack of exercise can be directly connected to all these
factors,'' Remington said.
   Another likely cause of significant state-to-state
discrepancies, Remington said, is the prevalence of cigarette
smoking.
   ``These (Northeast and Midwest) states are the states that have
high rates of cigarette smoking,'' he said. ``And we do know that
cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of heart
disease. Most deaths from smoking are heart attacks _ not lung
cancer.''
   In contrast, ``the lowest rates of smoking are in the West,'' he
said.
   The five worst states for men and heart disease _ New York, New
Jersey, Rhode Island, Michigan and Ohio _ are all in the Northeast
or Midwest, where other states with the highest rates were
clustered, the CDC reported.
   The best rates are clustered near Chesapeake Bay and in the
West. The five lowest heart disease death rates for men were in the
District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Mexico, Maryland and Utah.
   Similar geographic patterns were shown for women, although males
historically suffer most from heart disease.
   New York had the nation's worst rate, with 320 out of every
100,000 men dying of ischemic heart disease in 1985. The national
average was 249 per 100,000; in New Mexico, the rate was 151.
   Remington said other possible causes for the geographic
disparities include cholesterol levels and differences in medical
care, for which no firm state-by-state data are available.
   Sociodemographic differences and population shifts also might
play a part, the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   However, heart disease death rates for all ages and geographic
areas have decreased in the last two decades, the CDC said, citing
previously reported research.
   Remington noted that much of the nation had similarly high heart
disease death rates in the 1950s, ``then California and the Western
states began declining. There's something about it. ... In certain
states, it started earlier.''

<HEAD>Another Justice Official Reportedly Leaving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another adviser to Attorney General Edwin
Meese III is about to leave his Justice Department post, according
to a published report. Meanwhile, a majority of people surveyed in
a new poll say they have a negative impression of the attorney
general.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper is talking with
private law firms and is expected to announce his resignation
before independent counsel James C. McKay issues a report on his
yearlong criminal investigation of Meese's financial dealings, The
Washington Post reported in Friday's editions. McKay is expected to
release his report within the next few weeks.
   Cooper played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to win
confirmation of Robert H. Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court and was
among a small group of trusted aides who helped Meese investigate
the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986.
   Two other top department officials, Deputy Attorney General
Arnold Burns and criminal division chief William Weld, quit
recently out of concern that Meese's continued tenure was hurting
the department's operations, morale and public image.
   The Post, which quoted unidentified sources, said that Cooper
did not return repeated telephone calls on Thursday seeking
comment. But the newspaper quoted Justice Department spokesman
Patrick Korten as saying that if Cooper were leaving, ``it would
scarcely be unusual at this point in the administration.''
   ``Take a look around at a dozen Cabinet agencies around town,
and you will find a number of presidential appointees have already
departed for the private sector,'' Korten said, adding that he had
``no knowledge of what Chuck's plans are.''
   Meese told a gathering of conservative congressmen on Wednesday
that McKay's report ``will clear him completely,'' said Rep. Cass
Ballenger, R-N.C., who attended the meeting.
   The report is expected to raise questions about Meese's ethical
behavior.
   Meanwhile, a Washington Post-ABC News Poll released Thursday
found that 51 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable
impression of Meese and only 9 percent had a favorable impression,
with 40 percent expressing no opinion.
   In addition, 38 percent said that he should resign, while 9
percent said he should not and 54 percent expressed no opinion on
the matter.
   The poll was based on telephone interviews conducted May 19 to
26 with 1,508 randomly selected adults. The margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Two Dead In Blast, Indian Government Bans Use Of Shrines By
Extremists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Indian laborers died today of
injuries suffered when a bomb went off in a crowded market in
Punjab, a northern Indian state racked by Sikh separatist violence.
   In another development, the federal government issued an
ordinance banning the use of temples and shrines for political
activity or the harboring of wanted criminals.
   President Ramaswami Venkataraman issued the ordinance on
Thursday, aimed at ending Sikh extremists' use of the Golden Temple
in Amritsar as a base for their separatist activities.
   The bomb, apparently hidden in a rickshaw, went off Thursday
night in the town of Phagwara in Karpurthala District, east of
Amritsar.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said 30 people were
injured, most of them laborers from nearby work camps. The news
agency said three of the victims were in serious condition at local
hospitals.
   It quoted police as saying the bombing was the work of the
Barbar Khalsa gang, one of a dozen Sikh extremist groups operating
in Punjab state. The news agency quoted District Police Chief
Swaran Singh as saying police raided a number of the radicals'
hideouts in a search for the bombers.
   Sikh radicals, who have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982, recently stepped up
attacks on Hindu migrant workers in Punjab.
   Government officials say that one-third of the estimated 700,000
Hindu migrants have fled to their homes in eastern India,
threatening to undermine Punjab's agricultural economy.
   The new ordinance was described by the Times of India newspaper
as ``the first step toward separation of religion from politics.''
   Legislation to make the rule permanent will be introduced in the
next session of Parliament, government officials said. Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's governing Congress Party has a majority in
both houses of Parliament, and the legislation is expected to be
enacted quickly.
   Violations will be punishable by imprisonment of up to five
years or a $770 fine.
   The ordinance was announced after the Sikh committee of elders
that governs the Golden Temple and other Sikh shrines said it could
not cooperate with police in keeping the sites free of extremists.
   Police and paramilitary troops have maintained a cordon around
the Golden Temple since May 9, when Sikh radicals inside the shrine
fired on police inspectors outside its walls.
   A siege ended May 18 with the surrender of the last of about 200
Sikh extremists and sympathizers from the shrine. Forty-six deaths
were reported during the confrontation, most of them Sikh militants.
   The Indian Express newspaper reported today that the government
has decided to go ahead with a plan to tear down scores of shops
and homes close to the shrine. The creation of a ``security
corridor'' would improve the ability of police to patrol around the
complex and prevent extremists from entering through numerous
alleys around it.
   Sikh militants have killed more than 1,170 people in Punjab this
year in hit-and-run attacks. Last year, 1,030 people died.
   Sikhs, whose religion was formed 500 years ago as an alternative
to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by
India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of
India's 800 million population but are a majority in Punjab.

   Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh may have fallen
on hard times, but reports that he is chauffeured to work in a
lowly Mercedes-Benz just aren't true, says a spokeswoman for the
Indian guru once famous for his Rolls Royce collection.
   ``We would never dream of asking Bhagwan to ride in a Mercedes.
Only a Rolls Royce will do,'' Ma Yoga Neelam, personal secretary to
Rajneesh, said in a statement issued here Thursday by his U.S.
press service.
   The guru makes the quarter-mile commute between his house and
the meditation hall at his Pune, India, ashram in a 1986
custom-built Rolls Royce Silver Spur equipped with a stereo,
videocassette recorder, color TV, refrigerator and bar, she said.
   The 21-foot limo has a silver exterior and walnut-inlaid doors
and matching mushroom-colored leather upholstery inside. However,
its standard lambswool carpet has been replaced with a synthetic
one because of the guru's allergies.
   Rajneesh, 56, who describes himself as the ``rich man's guru,''
moved to India in 1985 after pleading guilty to U.S. immigration
charges.
   During the 4{ years he headed a commune in central Oregon,
Rajneesh accumulated a fleet of more than 90 Rolls-Royces. They
were sold after the guru pleaded guilty to immigration fraud
charges and was deported and his commune disbanded.

   Maxine was shy and nervous, her legs
trembling as her brown eyes surveyed the crowded room.
   Then, the audience burst into applause as Bucks County
commissioners honored her on ``Maxine the Heroic Dog Day''
Wednesday in suburban Philadelphia.
   The 4-year-old, 91-pound, black-and-brown Doberman was not shy
in the early hours of March 28, when fire erupted in her family's
home in Quakertown.
   The dog, once an abused stray, ran back and forth through heavy
smoke to awaken two sleeping children and lead them to safety. She
was burned on the back and one paw in the process. Quakertown Fire
Chief Fred W. Guenst credited her with saving the lives of George
Roeder III, 14, and his sister Jessica, 12.
   Their parents, George Jr., 33, and Deborah, 30, were at work
when the fire broke out.
   ``Max woke us up. She was running back and forth and jumping up
on my bed, and she was whining and barking and pulling on me,'' the
boy said. ``I woke up and I saw the fire. My bed was on fire.''
   Maxine got Jessica up in a similar fashion and the children and
dog fled to safety.
   ``Without the dog, the children would have perished, there's no
doubt about it,'' Guenst said. ``The dog absolutely saved their
lives.''

   For 20 years, no regular classes were scheduled on Wednesdays,
and the class-free day became known as Wonderful Wednesday at the
Macon school.
   But wonders ceased this week, said Barry Jenkins, Mercer's dean
of student affairs.
   Last spring, Mercer's Council of Undergraduate Deans decided to
switch from the quarter to the semester system. In the process, the
council did away with the midweek break, which was intended to give
students a day to catch up on studies and pursue other academic
enrichment.
   School officials, however, felt the day off was not being used
wisely, and ``Wonderful Wednesday'' also restricted the college's
academic calendar.

<HEAD>Government Plans Talks On Northern Ireland; Protestant Given Life
Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
indicated it wants to talk with Northern Ireland's main political
parties about returning some local control to the province.
   Strife-torn Northern Ireland has been administered directly from
London since Britain suspended the provincial parliament there in
March 1972 because of sharp differences between the majority
Protestant and minority Roman Catholic communities.
   In Belfast, meanwhile, a deputy commander of an outlawed
Protestant paramilitary group was sentenced Thursday to three life
terms in prison after confessing to three murders and 41 other
terrorist crimes.
   Lord Justice MacDermott sentenced Denis McClean, 40, and said
the defendant had pleaded guilty to terrorist crimes that could
never have been proved if he had not confessed to police.
   In London, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom
King, said in a statement Thursday night that he would consider
further how progress might be made towards giving some power back
to Northern Ireland's provincial authorities.
   The announcement by King, the Cabinet member responsible for the
province, followed a series of separate talks in recent months
involving him and political leaders from Northern Ireland.
   Earlier Thursday, King met with the province's two main
Protestant politicians, James Molyneaux and the Rev. Ian Paisley.
   Molyneaux is leader of the Official Unionist Party. Paisley is
leader of the Democratic Unionist Party.
   The liberal British newspaper The Guardian said Molyneaux and
Paisley had agreed to talks with Northern Ireland's moderate
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party.
   The Guardian said however that it has yet to be seen whether the
Social Democratic and Labor Party wants to talk with the
Protestants.
   In Belfast Crown Court, Judge MacDermott said he believed
McClean, a leader of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force, had
confessed because he wanted to clear his conscience.
   In addition to the murders, the charges for which McClean was
convicted included manslaughter of a policewoman, six attempted
murders, bomb making, causing explosions and illegal possession of
guns.
   The prosecution said McClean's first victim was a 62-year-old
Protestant, William Wallace, who died during a gun and bomb attack
on a Belfast bar in 1973.
   McClean had admitted in a written confession to police that he
and two other men attacked the bar because it was owned by a Roman
Catholic.
   McClean's two other murder victims, killed in random attacks
against Catholic targets, were a 45-year-old taxi driver in 1984,
and a 30-year-old hospital chef last year. Both were Catholics.
   The policewoman died while on patrol in 1975 in a bomb attack at
a bar at the east coast resort of Bangor.

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother of 10 tending her garden, two
workers digging a canal and several children are among the most
recent victims of American cluster bombs dropped on Laos during the
Vietnam War.
   It's been 15 years since the last American sorties were flown
over this Southeast Asian nation, but the death toll continues to
mount, American relief workers say.
   Buried in the jungle of this land-locked nation, the
fruit-shaped bombs, each about the size of a tennis ball, still
maim and kill.
   Although total casualty figures have not been compiled, the
American Friends Service Committee and the Mennonite Central
Committee say hundreds have lost their lives or limbs to the
devices since the end of the war.
   Since January, American aid workers say, the bombs have killed
10 people and injured 12 others on Laos' Plain of Jars. In May,
five bombs were found by a joint U.S.-Laotian team searching for
the remains of Americans missing in action at a crash site in
Savannakhet province.
   Nicknamed ``guavas'' or ``oranges'' by U.S. troops or
``bombies'' by the Laotians, the anti-personnel devices were
dropped during the 1964-73 air war over Laos.
   Roger Rumpf of American Friends says the Laotian government has
not worked to clear the bombs.
   Rumpf said the once strategic Plain of Jars remains perhaps the
most dangerous zone and large tracts of land can be farmed only at
great risk.
   During the war, the United States dropped thousands of bombs on
the area, turning it into a moonscape. Laotians say two tons of
bombs fell for every human being on the plain.
   The area was a key communications and transport route between
Vietnam, Laos and Thailand and was used by Communist forces as a
supply route.
   The American Friends Service Committee and the Mennonite Central
Committee _ the only American aid organizations allowed into
communist Laos to date _ operate here on a small scale.
   Local officials reportedly are eager for outside help, but the
central Laotian government has rejected tentative offers for
official American assistance. The U.S. Congress for its part has
given the cold shoulder to such proposals for aid.
   Rumpf has spent five years in Laos since the 1975 communist
victory over the U.S.-backed Vientiane government. His group has
provided farmers with 20,000 shovels, said to be far safer than
hoes, which tend to set off the bombs on impact.
   The Mennonites have offered to supply Laotians with a
custom-built tractor with a special detonator for bomb-littered
fields but volunteers to drive the machine have been lacking.
   Now, the Mennonites are awaiting word from Vientiane authorities
on a program to set up bomb-clearing teams in each district of
Xiengkhouang province, where the Plain of Jars is located.
   The proposal was submitted a year ago.
   Rumpf said that with the passing of time the small bombs have
become especially dangerous. Monsoon rains and erosion have driven
some beneath the surface of fields while others ``float'' back up
to the topsoil.
   Villagers find the weapons a good source of income. The innards
of the bombs are sold to the Vietnamese as ball bearings for
bicyles, and casings are turned into wick lamps. The metal from
larger bombs is fashioned into household utensils.
   Statistics vary, but standard histories say more bomb tonnage
was dropped on Laos than on any country in history. Sometimes cited
is the figure 2 million tons _ more than the U.S. unleashed in all
of World War II.
   The Plain of Jars was ravaged, as were areas along the vital
communist supply route, the Ho Chi Minh trail, in southern Laos.
Few buildings were left standing, farm animals were killed by the
thousands and refugees swarmed from these regions.

   A coalition of black leaders is warning
Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis that the
``price'' for him to win black votes in the November general
election is his backing of ``stringent and comprehensive''
sanctions against South Africa.
   A 28-page report released by the coalition called for Dukakis to
support the sanctions as well as recognize the Marxist government
in Angola and to end aid to the South African-supported rebel group
UNITA in Angola.
   ``The Democratic Party can lose with our support, (but) they
cannot win without it,'' said Randall Robinson, head of the
anti-apartheid group TransAfrica, in making the announcement
Thursday. ``So all those who turned out in the black community for
the primary must turn out for Michael Dukakis if he has any chance
of the White House. There is a price for that turnout.''
   The report was authored and supported by the Congressional Black
Caucus, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social
Change, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the National Council of Negro Women and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.

   The governor's appearance, as a favorite-son president
candidate, may overshadow the only real business of the one-day

   The convention, which is being held in Boston for the first time

   A 1,500-pound bull terrorized residents
for over two hours, flipping a dog, charging cars and an air
conditioner and scattering backyard items before being shot and
killed, witnesses and police said.
   ``The animal was highly agitated. It was intense negotiations
from behind the car, I'll tell you that,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Greg
Wyble.
   The black-and-white Holstein, who jumped a fence for the second
time after it gored a cow to death about a week ago, went on a
rampage Wednesday.
   Susan Shelley said the bull chased her inside and then came
right up to her front door.
   ``He was pawing the ground and snorting. I was waiting for it to
plow through at any time,'' she said. ``I had six kids in the house
who were crying.''
   Ms. Shelley said the bull flipped a neighbor's dog through the
air but didn't hurt it.
   ``It scared the life out of everybody. There were people in
their houses with loaded guns. They didn't know what it would do
next,'' she said.
   The bull ripped through hedges, dented a car and a truck, tore
down clotheslines and scattered boats, barbecue grills and lawn
furniture, witnesses said.
   ``One of the neighbors told me the bull was looking at its
reflection in a sliding glass door. And when a nearby
air-conditioner compressor came on, he got startled and rammed the
air conditioner with his head,'' Wyble said.
   The bull also attacked a sheriff's patrol car, although no
damage was reported, Wyble said.
   Deputies used food to try to entice the animal into a nearby
pasture, and county animal control officers tried to corral the
bull for more than two hours to no avail, Wyble said.
   With the approval of Animal Control Division Director Dennis
Moore, a deputy fired four 12-gauge shotgun slugs into the animal's
head, killing it, Wyble said.
   Moore said the bull had earlier caused problems but had been
lured back into a fenced-in pasture. It jumped the fence again
before entering the residential area here west of Palm Beach and
was shot in the backyard of a home.
   ``We tried everything we could, but in the end it came down to a
matter of public safety,'' Moore said.
   The animal was owned by Jose Castillo, who neighbors said is out
of the country.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis is increasingly shifting the focus of his campaign to the
general election this fall, even though he's keeping up the
pretense that the party's nominating strugggle isn't over yet.
   ``We have not carried California in years,'' he told an
enthusiastic rally Thursday night as he wrapped up a quick, trip in
advance of the state's June 7 primary. ``But this is the year.
We're going to carry it.''
   Dukakis made his prediction of victory in the Republican bastion
of Orange County near Los Angeles _ going so far as to predict a
victory over Georeg Bush there as well as statewide. His aides said
they thought that was doubtful but said Dukakis decided to stop in
Orange County several weeks before the formal start of the fall
campaign in hopes of minimizing Bush's expected local victory and
thus make California easier to win.
   The Massachusetts governor was wrapping up a Western swing today
with stops in Albuquerque and Texas. The New Mexico visit was in
advance of the state's June 7 primary.
   But the decision to attend a barbeque in Austin, Texas, which
held its primary March 8, was made with the fall campaign in mind.
Dukakis was expected to receive the endorsements of several locally
prominent officials as he continues the process of unifying the
party for the general election campaign.
   Dukakis' manuevering comes as fresh public opinion polls
indcated he holds a substantial lead over the Republican vice
president.
   A Washington Post-ABC survery published in Friday's editions
reported the Massachusetts governor gaining the support of 53
percent of those polled to 40 percent for Bush.
   Dukakis dismissed the importance of the poll as he campaigned
through California on Thursday insisting, for the record, that he
still is concentrating on his final four primaries against
Democratic rival Jackson.
   ``It's not over yet,'' he said of his nominating struggle with
his sole remaining opponent, even though he is expected to wrap up
enough delegates on the final day of the primary season to clinch
the nomination.
   Dukakis used his time Thursday to depct himself as a
progressive, future oriented candidate.
   He stopped at a company-sponsored day care center in Palo Alto,
and issued a statement calling for expanded day care programs
nationally. He told employees of a high-tech medical firm that he
favors devoting a greater share of federal research and development
funds to civilian work.
   He also made a brief tour of a facility in Irvine where lasers
are developed for use in treatment of cancer and other disease, and
he and his wife Kitty used a laser beam to burn their names into a
honeydew melon.
   In between, at a news conference, he renewed his demand for a
``full explanation'' of links between the CIA and Panama's military
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on drug
charges in the United States.
   ``The vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether or not we
were paying Noriega, he said `I can't confirm or deny that.'''
   ``He's not running for press spokesman of the CIA,'' said
Dukakis. ``He's suppose to be running for president of the United
States.''
   He said Bush or President Reagan should explain any links betwen
the CIA and Noriega. ``Who are the people that were involved in
drug running and profit skimming and who was it in this
administration who thought that made sense.''

<HEAD>Fetal Heart Rates Slow After Very Vigorous Maternal Exercise,
Study Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exercise is good for pregnant women, but
one-third of the 45 expectant mothers who pushed themselves to the
limit in brief workouts slowed the heart rates of their unborn
babies, researchers say.
   Whether diminished heart rates hurt fetuses is unclear, but it
could deprive them of needed oxygen, researchers said in a study in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Milder exercise doesn't have the same effect, and the findings
suggest that higher exercise levels than currently recommended are
safe for pregnant women, said lead researcher Dr. Marshall W.
Carpenter.
   ``The study is encouraging that women can continue exercising
during pregnancy at levels reminiscent of that before pregnancy,''
he said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   ``On the other hand, I would caution women against exceeding 145
to 150 heartbeats a minute (for their own heart rate) because we
don't know what effect it has on the fetus.''
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
recommends that an expectant mother not exercise beyond a level
that raises her heart rate to 140 beats per minute, Carpenter said.
   But that recommendation was largely precautionary, and ``we can
give women a little more latitude than before,'' he said.
   The 45 women in the study were 4{ months to 7{ months pregnant,
and had an average age of 29.
   Fetal heart rates were measured at moderate and maximum exercise
levels by Carpenter, physiologist Stanley P. Sady, and other
researchers at Brown University.
   They found that maximum exercise _ when women peddled stationary
bicycles against increasing resistance until they were unwilling or
unable to continue _ produced brief episodes of slowed heart rates
in 15 fetuses.
   Two other fetuses experienced slowed heart rates linked to
moderate exercise, they said.
   The researchers believe any oxygen shortage was mild because
tests given the unborn babies 30 minutes after the initial
measurements were normal.
   The slowed heart rates did not appear to give rise to later
problems, the researchers said. Three of the 45 infants studied as
fetuses died within five weeks of birth, but of apparently
unrelated causes.
   Some of the study's subjects had exercised vigorously on a
regular basis before becoming pregnant and some had not, but that
did not appear to affect fetal heartbeats, the researchers said.
   Dr. Robert L. Jones, a researcher at Pennsylvania State
University College of Medicine in Hershey, said in a telephone
interview that the most important consideration is tailoring the
level of exercise to the individual.

   The Reagan administration's plans for
random drug testing of all federal prison employees have been put
on hold for three weeks more by a judge.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel on Thursday extended the
restraining order to June 16. The order had been sought in a
lawsuit by the American Federation of Government Employees, the
country's largest federal workers union.
   The testing was to have started last Monday. Weigel issued a
temporary restraining order May 20, saying constitutional problems
were raised by testing law-abiding employees not suspected of
wrongdoing.
   The delay has triggered a hiring freeze by the Bureau of
Prisons, said Justice Department lawyer Richard Lepley. Lepley,
noting that the agency has tested job applicants since 1984, asked
Weigel to exempt applicants from his order.
   The judge did not make an immediate decision.
   The program stems from President Reagan's 1986 order that
federal employees in sensitive jobs receive drug testing. The
prisons agency was one of the first agencies scheduled to begin
testing and the first to order random tests for all employees on
the theory that all hold sensitive jobs.
   The union, which claims 9,400 prison employees among its 750,000
members, contends in its suit that testing without suspicion of
drug use by an individual violates constitional standards for
unreasonable search.
   The suit also claims violations of federal laws forbidding
discrimination against the handicapped and requiring that employee
discipline be related to job performance.
   Union attorney Joe Goldberg said Thursday that the government's
safety justifications were a smokescreen. ``This program was not
designed for safety,'' Goldberg said.
   ``Testing was developed as a political reaction'' to
administration frustration at its inability to curb drug
importation, he said. ``Federal employees were an available
scapegoat.''
   Lepley acknowledged that testing does not directly measure
inability to do a job, but said it could reveal the potential for
abusing drugs, would discourage employees from using them and would
help keep drugs out of prisons.
   Prison employees have a reduced expectation of privacy, he said.
   In a separate suit, the union has challenged the entire drug
testing program, which would cover 345,000 employees in 40 agencies.
   Another suit was filed in the same court Thursday by an employee
group, the Overseas Education Association, challenging plans for
random drug testing of more than 9,600 teachers in schools run by
the Defense Department for U.S. military dependents in 20 countries.

   Lawmakers have agreed to put
aside a lengthy dispute over congressional election results and
allow the nation's single-chamber legislature to convene _ nearly a
month late.
   Legislators from the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance
and the governing Christian Democratic Party reached consensus
Thursday after three hours of negotiations in the National Assembly.
   The Alliance, known by its Spanish acronym Arena, contends it
won 31 seats in the 60-seat assembly in March 20 elections. The
Central Elections Council said Arena won 30 delegates, prompting
Arena party leaders to charge that the Christian Democrats stole
one through fraud.
   Arena's claim is pending before the Supreme Court.
   The council gave the Christian Democrats 23 seats and the small
National Conciliation Party seven seats.
   The National Assembly was to have been installed May 1.
   By Thursday night, only one legislator of the National
Conciliation Party supported the Arena-Christian Democrat
agreement. He indicated he would vote with Arena on most bills, in
effect giving the rightists a majority.

<HEAD>Government To Renovate Ancient Tibetan Palace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to renovate the ancient
palace of the Dalai Lama that overlooks the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa _ at an estimated cost of $8 million, an official newspaper
reported today.
   The China Daily said portions of the Potala Palace have been
cracked or damaged by worms over the centuries. It said more than
$1 million was spent on repairs in 1981, but that this was ``far
from enough.''
   The planned renovation will include repairs to 720 square feet
of frescoes, the report said.
   The vast Potala Palace, which now includes hundreds of rooms
stacked 13 stories high, was begun in the 7th century as a
pavilion. It was greatly enlarged in the 17th century.
   It includes living quarters for the Dalai Lama, Tibet's
traditional god-king, mausoleums of seven previous Dalai Lamas,
ceremonial halls, treasure store rooms, government offices, a
prison and a monastery.
   Since 1959, however, when the current Dalai Lama fled to India,
only a few monks have been allowed to remain in the Potala, and it
serves mainly as a museum for tourists.
   The Dalai Lama fled China during a failed uprising by thousands
of Tibetans against communist Chinese rule, imposed nine years
earlier.
   Most of the temples and religious sites in Tibet were destroyed
or badly damaged by radical bands of Red Guards during China's
Cultural Revolution from 1966-76.
   Tibetan activists claim Beijing is renovating the temples now to
lure more foreigners to Lhasa and profit from their tourist dollars.
   The activists have staged two large demonstrations over the past
year in Lhasa calling for an independent Tibet. Both were crushed
by Chinese authorities.

<HEAD>AZT Might Reduce Spread Of AIDS To Sexual Partners, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AZT could make AIDS patients less infectious
to their sexual partners, according to researchers who found high
levels of the virus-fighting drug in the semen of patients treated
with it.
   However, the University of Minnesota researchers caution in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association that larger and
more detailed studies are needed to determine if AZT can reduce the
risk of spreading the virus.
   ``Our worst scenario is that some patients taking AZT will
decide that they no longer need to follow existing (safer-sex)
recommendations,'' said Dr. Henry Balfour, a University of
Minnesota virologist and a member of the research team.
   Researchers are trying to learn whether the drug even lowers the
amount of AIDS virus in the semen, said study author Dr. Keith
Henry, who is with the St. Paul Health Department. If so, said
Henry, it raises the possibility that AZT could lower the risk of
virus transmission to sexual partners.
   Health experts strongly urge people who even suspect that they
may have the AIDS virus to forgo sexual intercourse, or at least to
use a condom to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.
   At best, AZT probably would reduce, rather than eliminate, the
risk of the virus spreading, and no one yet knows by how much,
Henry explained. The abstinence-or-condom recommendations are
expected to continue as the first line of defense regardless of
what further studies find, he added.
   Semen has been the primary means by which the AIDS virus has
been transmitted since the epidemic began in 1981. Infected blood
is the other major transmission route.
   AZT is not a cure for AIDS, but it's the only drug so far that
has shown a clear-cut ability to extend some AIDS patients' lives.
It is being taken by at least 25,000 people who have the AIDS
virus, Balfour said.
   The Minnesota study found that the level of AZT in six patients
was typically several times higher in their semen than in their
blood. These AZT levels would be enough to keep the virus from
multiplying in a test tube, but Balfour said the results might be
different in the body.
   In addition, the drug isn't designed to get rid of all the
virus, only to keep it from growing, he said.
   Three of the patients in the study have AIDS, and three others
were ill with less severe symptoms called ARC, or AIDS-related
complex.
   The study was the first major look at how AZT concentrates in
body fluids other than blood, the researchers said.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises To 131 With New Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from flooding in southeast China
rose to 131, including five people who died after a new rainstorm
in Guangdong province, official reports said today.
   The China News Service reported that 91 people were dead and
more than 650 injured in coastal Fujian province, up from the
previous toll of 82 dead and 436 injured.
   Fujian, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces were hit with heavy rains
May 19-21. Three people died in Jiangxi and 32 in Hunan. The China
News Service, in a report on Fujian, said floodwaters were
receeding.
   The Xinhua News Service said heavy rains fell Tuesday and
Wednesday in northern areas of Guangdong province, killing five
people, injuring more than 370 and leaving three missing.
   Government officials rushed to the region to help relocate 8,000
people from heavily flooded areas, Xinhua said.
   It said 12 inches of rain fell on one Guangdong county, Fugang,
during the two-day storm, causing 2,150 houses to collapse and
flooding 6,422 acres of farmland.
   The English-language China Daily said the rains damaged part of
the Beijing-Canton railway line in northern Guangdong. Rail service
was halted for about six hours early Wednesday until repairs were
made, it said.
   The China News Service described damage in Fujian as much more
devastating than previously estimated.
   It said nearly 100,000 homes collapsed and 823,745 acres of
farmland were flooded, wiping out the crops in more than half the
area.
   The news agency estimated direct economic losses in Fujian at
$53.8 million.
   The heavy rains that have hit China's east coast have not helped
drought-stricken inland provinces, especially those in
north-central China such as Gansu, where a drought has lasted
nearly two years.

   A top Soviet arms control official today called on
the United States to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut
long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of
compromise.
   Viktor Karpov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's arms
control department and a former chief negotiator at Geneva arms
talks, told the Tass news agency the United States had agreed to
compromise on several key issues, but then backed off.
   ``As soon as an issue reaches the American delegation in Geneva,
it gets stuck there,'' Karpov complained.
   He said that President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev agreed at their meeting in Washington last December to
abide by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   ``The Soviet side has received more than one assurance from
Washington that they are prepared to fulfill this condition, but
things haven't moved any further,'' Karpov said.
   The ABM treaty is a key hang-up in negotiations on a treaty to
cut arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles.
   Karpov also said the United States had not responded to Soviet
proposals on sea-launched missiles.
   ``We believe that no bans on restrictions may be allowed when it
comes to verification concerning this kind of missiles, but the
United States is not prepared for such an extensive verification
system,'' he said.
   ``There has been no specific proposals coming from them, only
excuses,'' Karpov said.
   He said the United States was not prepared to give up its
advantage in airborne cruise missiles.
   Karpov said the United States had effectively given notice that
it will not be ready to sign an agreement on strategic weapons at
the fourth summit meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev, next week
in Moscow.
   ``It will be essential to give precise instructions to the
delegations from the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. in Geneva to keep
working intensively to hammer out the issues remaining in the
problem of strategic offen arms as soon as possible,'' he said.

   Iranian troops were busy building new
fortifications east of this tiny frontier post after Iraq drove
them back into their own territory in a lightning attack east of
the port city of Basra.
   Reporters on a government-organized tour of the war front
Thursday saw the bodies of dozens of Iranian soldiers scattered on
this dusty plain along with their light weapons, rocket-propelled
grenade launchers and hand grenades.
   A field hospital built in a trench and well protected with
concrete walls was abandoned. Its equipment was scattered on the
floor along with more bodies of Iranian soldiers.
   Reporters were shown a small number of Iranian prisoners of war,
some in their mid-teens, others in their 60s. Iraqi officers would
not let reporters speak to them.
   From this border post 10 miles east of Basra, Iranian troops
were visible in the distance, hastily building new fortifications.
   The Iraqi officers said their forces, led by elite Presidential
Guards, routed the Iranians in a five-pronged offensive launched
Wednesday morning that lasted 10 hours.
   A senior officer, speaking on condition his name and rank not be
divulged, said Iraqi troops backed by tanks, artillery, jet
fighters and helicopter gunships retook 50 square miles of Iraqi
territory.
   The attack was spearheaded by tanks, part of Iraq's heavily
mechanized armed forces, and faced more lightly armed but sometimes
fanatical Iranian Revolutionary Guards and volunteers.
   The officer said those Iranian troops that weren't killed or
wounded ``fled to the other side of the border.''
   This observation post is where the Iranians pushed their troops
into Iraq in a January 1987 offensive that eventually petered out
just six miles from Basra. The southern city, Iraq's second
largest, is also its only sea port.
   Iranian army jeeps, trucks and ammunition stocks, some in good
shape, were abandoned by the Iranians along tracks they had built
to approach their main defense points.
   Western military analysts estimated that between 35,000 and
40,000 Iraqi troops took part in this week's offensive, but
reliable casualty estimates were not yet available.
   Reporters counted 400 Iranian prisoners of war being held here.
   The analysts say about 25,000 Iranians were believed killed in
the 1987 offensive and perhaps 10,000 Iraqis.
   Iraq has gone on the offensive recently after more than two
years of defensive tactics in the war, which began in September
1980. On April 18, Iraqi forces retook the Faw Peninsula, which had
been in Iranian hands since February 1986.

   Burt Reynolds built a special
chapel for his wedding last month to Loni Anderson and hired a
special caterer and a motorized stagecoach. But then he forgot
where he put the marriage license.
   ``He called us the day before the wedding and said he couldn't
seem to find it,'' said John Dunkle, Palm Beach County clerk of
courts. ``He wanted to know what to do.''
   Dunkle had personally delivered the marriage license application
to Reynolds at his Jupiter ranch March 2.
   The application is good for 60 days. Burt and Loni were married
on the 57th day. All Reynolds had to do was get the minister and
two witnesses to sign the license after the ceremony.
   That is, if he could find it.
   Dunkle told him a duplicate could be supplied. Marriage License
Supervisor Lynda Brown stayed in the office all day April 29, the
day of the wedding, waiting for Burt to call.
   ``I wanted to take the duplicate up there. I wanted to go to the
wedding,'' she said. ``My phone didn't ring the whole day.''
   Someone in Dunkle's office later sent Reynolds a duplicate. One
of Reynolds' assistants, Elaine Hall, is mailing it around so the
best man and another witness can sign it.
   Reynolds and Anderson are officially married, Dunkle said. They
just can't prove it.

   A twin-propeller Danish cargo plane
crashed and exploded near Hanover's airport, killing the pilot and
co-pilot, police said today.
   The Fokker 27 crashed late Thursday while approaching the
airport for a scheduled stop, police said. They said the pilot and
co-pilot, the only people abord, were apparently Danes.
   The airplane, on its way to Nuremberg from Billund, Denmark,
crashed in an uninhabited area about a mile from the airport and
exploded when it hit the ground, police said.
   Police said the crash is being investigated by local air
authorities who have not yet determined the cause.
   Further information was not immediately available.

   Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke will be back
on CBS in separate new series this fall, but ``Cagney & Lacey'' are
gone.
   Also canceled are ``Houston Knights,'' ``High Mountain
Rangers,'' ``Eisenhower & Lutz'' and ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney & Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said CBS
President Kim LeMasters. ``But the show had suffered the slings and
arrows. We felt it was time for it to go off before it got beaten
up more.''
   ``Cagney & Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   The critically praised series ``Frank's Place'' isn't in the
fall lineup, but LeMasters said it would return next season as soon
as there is a protected time period where it can stay put. ``Kate &
Allie'' and ``Jake and the Fatman'' are also being held until later
in the season.
   Taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was ``one of the
toughest decisions I had to make,'' said LeMasters. ``It's an
extraordinary show. But what it boiled down to was, would I put it
on the schedule to be bounced around, or would I take the heat and
hold it for an advantageous time period?''
   Other shows that were new in 1987 that did make the
second-season slate were ``Coming of Age,'' a mid-season
replacement, ``Wiseguy,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Tour of
Duty.''
   CBS has already announced that its new season will begin a month
late, in October, because of the strike by the Writers Guild of
America.
   When it does get underway, there will be new comedies from Mary
Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, who played husband and wife in the
popular 1960s sitcom ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' This time they'll
have separate shows, but they'll air back-to-back on Wednesdays.
   In her show, yet to be named, Moore will play a New York
divorcee. In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' Van Dyke plays a Broadway star
trying to help his more cerebral son, played by Van Dyke's
real-life son, Barry, keep a struggling theater group going.
   The network has added several new comedies to the schedule in an
effort to draw younger viewers. Among these is ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the hit movie of the same name. Patrick Cassidy and Melora
Hardin will play the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles.
   Candice Bergen will make her television series debut in ``Murphy
Brown,'' playing a big star from a popular network news show.
   Other news shows are:
   _``Close to Home,'' half-hour comedy starring James Naughton,
Royana Black, Mirian Flynn, Steve Vinovich and Bryan Cranston,
about a father and teen-age daughter (Naughton, Black) adjusting to
life with mom, who has left to ``discover'' herself.
   _``Almost Grown,'' one-hour drama about three decades in the
life of a marriage with emphasis on music, starring Tim Daly and
Eve Gordon as the couple who meet and marry in the '60s.
   _``Paradise,'' one-hour drama set in the 1890s starring Lee
Horsley as a gunfighter who inherits his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' one-hour drama starring Sam Robards as a journalism
teacher who returns to his old high school to teach television
reporting.
   ``Van Dyke,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``TV 101'' are the first series
from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new production company.
   CBS News was celebrating the retention of the all three hours of
prime-time news programming. It had been rumored last week that
either ``48 Hours'' or ``West 57th'' would have to go. ``60
Minutes'' is a top-10 show. But when the schedule was announced,
all three shows were in the lineup, in their same time periods.
LeMasters said the decision had nothing to do with the writers
strike _news show writers are in a different union _ and the shows
were retained strictly on the basis of merit.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``Mary Tyler Moore,'' ``The
Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knot's Landing.''
   Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``West 57th.''
   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''

   Muscovites polled on the eve of the summit
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev showed
a lingering mistrust of U.S. policies and found Reagan a puzzle,
according to a poll published today.
   Of the 939 Moscow adults surveyed this month for The New York
Times and CBS News, 52 percent said ``U.S. policies present a
threat to the security of the Soviet Union.'' Twenty-nine percent
said they did not.
   Residents of the Soviet capital find Reagan puzzling, according
to the telephone poll. More said their impressions were favorable
than unfavorable, 24 percent to 18 percent, but about half did not
venture an opinion.
   Gorbachev and Reagan are to meet next week in Moscow.
   The respondents were firmly behind Gorbachev's drive to improve
the Soviet Union. Seventy-eight percent supported his domestic
policies completely, and 19 percent less than completely.
   However, many of those surveyed reacted warily to telephone
questions from strangers in a country where historically a freely
expressed opinion could mean time in a Siberian labor camp, the
Times said. Others seemed to reply mechanically with responses they
deemed politically correct.
   The interviews were conducted by The Institute of Sociological
Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on May 7, 8, 14 and 15.
The margin of error for the poll was 4 percentage points, meaning
results could vary 4 points either way.
   Respondents especially liked Gorbachev's calls for greater
democracy and openness. Many said they wanted liberalization to
include competitive elections, private publishing and tolerance of
public demonstrations, the Times said.
   However, only about half said they have seen tangible benefits
from his program of economic reform.
   Only 40 percent said they expected their expected their
families' standard of living to improve in the next five years.
Eighteen percent predicted it would worsen.

<TEXT>
   South Africa's foreign minister criticized U.S.
sanctions against his country during an interview on American
television, but his apartheid opponent, Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
called for tougher steps.
   Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha and Tutu, the Noble Peace
Prize-winning Anglican prelate, were interviewed separately on
ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' show Thursday.
   Tutu criticized the United States for failing to take tougher
steps against South Africa to induce that country to abandon
apartheid, the policy of racial separation.
   ``We are saying, `Look, in South Africa, many of the things that
you hold dear are being treated with considerable disdain. Why
don't you do something that will indicate to the South African
government and to the victims that you actually do mean what you
say?''' Tutu said.
   Botha, meanwhile, claimed that ``in general, black South
Africans have more effective civil rights than black Americans.''
   ``You do not want to have a proper analysis of our dilemma,''
Botha said. ``You simply ascribe to us the worst motives. We appeal
to the black Americans to try to understand that in many instances
black South Africans enjoy better medical facilities, better
housing facilities, better education and greater prospects of
power-sharing than black Americans will ever enjoy.''
   Tutu said that despite the South African government's relaxation
or elimination of some apartheid policies, ``those steps have not
come about as a result of any significant conversion on their part.
... Political power still remains very firmly in the hands of the
white minority and until we deal with that problem we are playing
marbles.''
   Responding to a question about whether economic sanctions were
effective, he said, ``if in fact sanctions are as ineffective as we
are being led to believe, why are the South African government, the
private sector ... jumping around like scalded cats, as if they had
ants in their pants?''
   Botha argued that the sanctions and the withdrawal of some
industries ``mean robbing our black people of jobs, of sending
their families into starvation.''
   He claimed a poll had shown that 75 percent of his country's
blacks opposed sanctions. When asked why the government would not
allow blacks to express such views by allowing them to vote, Botha
denied that blacks are being denied political power.

   A U.S. immigration official says Ferdinand
Marcos should be allowed to return to the Philippines for his
mother's funeral, a remark that drew a rebuke from a Philippine
official.
   The deposed Philippine president reiterated his desire to return
to his homeland as he ended a two-day stay Thursday at St. Francis
Medical Center for treatment of chest pains.
   Harold Ezell, regional commissioner for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, met with Marcos' chief spokesman, Arturo
Aruiza, shortly afterward and said he thought Marcos should be
allowed to attend his mother's burial.
   ``Whether or not you agree with everything that's happened,
there is still a factor that Ferdinand Marcos is a human being who
had a mother who has passed away,'' Ezell said after accepting a
letter from Aruiza requesting approval for the return.
   ``The politics _ the government decisions _ sometimes have to be
weighed separately from that,'' he said.
   But, Ezell said, the final decision rests with Philippine
President Corazon Aquino. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos
back, calling him a national security risk.
   The Philippine consul general in Hawaii criticized Ezell.
   ``I thought his behavior was rather irregular,'' said Tomas
Gomez. ``He is a public official who is supposed to react to a
bureaucratic process; he didn't have to editorialize.''
   Ezell said he sympathized with Marcos' situation because Ezell's
father died about a year ago.
   Before his release from the hospital, Marcos told reporters that
Mrs. Aquino should back down from her claim that he poses a threat.
   ``I've told them I will not bother them ... but will hold back
the people from starting violence,'' Marcos said while seated in a
wheelchair.
   Marcos, 70, was accompanied by his wife, Imelda, several aides,
a nurse and his physician, Dr. Azucena Ignacio, who said Marcos was
fit to travel.
   Ignacio said arthritis or inflammation in the area of the left
sixth rib caused Marcos' chest pains. Marcos improved dramatically
with rest and was being treated with a painkiller, she said.
   Aruiza's letter contained a list of 71 people for whom Marcos
wants officials to grant permission to go to the Philippines for
the funeral of Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4 at age 95.
   William Craig, the INS district director, said the 71 also
requested permission to re-enter the United States if allowed to
travel to the Philippines.
   Marcos is under ``a prevent departure notice,'' which means he
needs permission to leave the United States, Craig said.
   Ezell and Craig said the letter would be forwarded to Washington
for consideration. Included in the list were Marcos, his wife, son
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and daughter Irene Araneta.
   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the United States would not consider any Marcos
trip without the approval of the Aquino government.
   According to the Philippine Department of Immigration and
Deportation, 16 of the 71 on the list are covered by a ``hold
order'' that prevents them from leaving the Philippines should they
return. They include Marcos, his wife and two children.

<HEAD>Man Who Shot Ailing Wife Sentenced To Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired farmer who admitted killing
his wife to end her suffering from Alzheimer's disease wept as he
asked a judge to place him in a nursing home instead of sending him
to prison.
   But the judge, apparently unmoved, on Thursday sentenced Oscar
Carlson, 78, to serve at least 28 months of a 43-month prison
sentence for the Feb. 29 shooting of his 71-year-old wife, Agnes,
in an Evansville nursing home.
   ``I haven't got many years left, maybe not many days, either,''
Carlson said before sentencing, his voice faltering. ``I hope you
will put me in a home, someplace where I can be of some good to
somebody.''
   Carlson told Douglas County District Judge Paul Ballard that he
was ``so sorry'' for what happened to his wife of 45 years.
   He was to begin serving his time at the Stillwater state prison
as soon as his transfer could be arranged from the Douglas County
jail, said defense attorney Michael Dolan.
   ``He's a frail old man placed in a system with violent people,''
said Dolan.
   However, Douglas County Attorney Ann Carrott said, ``Justice was
served by the fact he was imprisoned.''
   With good behavior, Carlson would be eligible for parole in 28
months.
   Carlson pleaded guilty several weeks ago to second-degree murder
after Ballard said he would consider a prison sentence of no more
than 43 months, or 28 months with good behavior. The agreement
departs from state sentencing guidelines, which call for an 18-year
sentence for second-degree murder.
   Ms. Carrott opposed even the 43-month sentence. Although she
said she felt compassion toward Carlson, she said she believes
sentencing guidelines should be followed.
   The prosecutor said defense attorneys did not confer with her on
the plea arrangement, and said sentencing Carlson to anything less
than 18 years would set a dangerous precedent.
   However, Carlson's other attorney, Thomas Reif, said, ``We're
talking about a man who's never even had a traffic ticket before
this. I do not think sending him to prison at his age would serve
society at all.''
   During a pre-sentence hearing, Carlson said he snapped when he
learned Feb. 28 that his wife had broken her hip and would have to
be hospitalized. The next day, he took an old pistol to the
Crestview Manor Nursing Home, and shot her four times.
   ``I just cracked up. I just couldn't take no more,'' Carlson
said.
   Relatives said the Carlson family was devastated by Mrs.
Carlson's death, but had forgiven Carlson.
   ``He's still our father and we understand it was hard on him,''
said Mildred Penuel of Fargo, N.D., Carlson's youngest daughter.
   Alzheimer's disease causes progressive memory loss and mental
degeneration.

<HEAD>Friend of Dann's Committed to Psychiatric Ward After Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female friend of Laurie Dann, who killed
one child and wounded six people during a shooting rampage, has
been charged with making harassing telephone calls similar to the
ones Dann was accused of, police said.
   Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of suburban Highwood was arrested at the
local convenience store where she worked and later surrendered a
.357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where she lived,
Winnetka Police Chief Herbert Timm said Thursday.
   Taylor was charged with threatening her former husband over the
telephone, Timm said. Before her death Friday, Dann had also been
accused of threatening her ex-husband.
   Taylor was arrested late Wednesday by a local-county task force
investigating Dann's background, Timm said. She was involuntarily
committed to a psychiatric unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago for treatment.
   ``We should let the psychiatrists examine her and then decide
what should be done,'' said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for Cook
County state's attorney's office.
   Last Friday, Dann started a small fire in a home, shot six
children at Hubbard Woods Elementary School, killing one, and then
shot and wounded a 20-year-old man at a nearby home. She then shot
and killed herself.
   At a news conference, Timm identified Taylor ``as a very close
friend of Laurie Dann.'' He said Taylor's ex-husband had warned
that ``she might be a threat to him, to herself and this
community.''
   ``It was extremely obvious that this was a serious situation. We
are concerned with the safety of the Taylor family. ... We wanted
to prevent another tragedy,'' Timm said.
   Dann and Taylor had been roommates about a year ago and also had
a distant family connection, said Assistant State's Attorney Randy
Stewart.
   Timm said there is no evidence that Taylor had any connection
with Dann's violent rampage or helped her make threatening calls.
   ``We are in the process of determining the extent of Ms.
Taylor's involvement with Laurie Dann,'' Timm said.
   In another development Thursday, an FBI official in Madison,
Wis., said Dann apparently acted alone in obtaining the poison she
used to lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she
sent or delivered to acquaintances before going on her Winnetka
shooting spree.
   ``Nobody else has surfaced as an accomplice based on the
investigation we did here,'' said Charles Steinmetz, supervisor of
the FBI's Madison office.
   Authorities are investigating whether Dann sent her former
husband, Russell Dann, an envelope containing fruit juice that was
found Wednesday at a Highland Park post office.
   Also Thursday, one of the children shot by Dann was released
from Evanston Hospital, and the most seriously injured victim,
8-year-old Lindsay Fisher, was upgraded to fair condition. Two
other children were in good condition at the hospital. Two other
shooting victims were in fair condition at Highland Park Hospital.
   Taylor was arrested on two outstanding warrants _ on a new
charge of threatening the life of her ex-husband, Scott Taylor, and
their children, who live with their father, and an old charge of
failing to appear on a drunken driving charge in Evanston, Timm
said.
   Taylor's ex-husband signed the complaint against her because he
was concerned about his family's safety and feared that Taylor
might harm herself, Winnetka Police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis said.

<HEAD>New Program Criticizes Militarism, Calls For Purge Of Bureaucrats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee says the Kremlin has in the past wrongly stressed
military over diplomatic solutions to world problems and that its
foreign policy is no longer dogmatic.
   A position paper approved by the 300-plus member body also
sharply criticizes the role the party has come to occupy in Soviet
society, saying bureaucrats are too often impeding the
effectiveness of government bodies.
   It proposes limiting party officials to two five-year terms,
with exceptions that could include Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and says
elections for party jobs should be by secret ballot with more than
one candidate.
   The report will serve as the foundation for an extraordinary
party conference that begins June 28, the first such gathering
since 1941. Its details were distributed Thursday by the official
Tass news agency.
   Approved Monday, it sets the agenda for a possible showdown
between reformers led by Gorbachev and conservatives resisting
change.
   The report says foreign policy before Gorbachev came to power
``trailed behind fundamental changes that occurred in the world and
missed chances to reduce tensions and enhance understanding among
nations.''
   Praising changes made by the Soviet leader, it said Kremlin
foreign policy now addresses problems of a world faced with nuclear
destruction while ``not imposing any conditions or dogmas on
anyone.''
   The new Soviet approach has led to a ``definite improvement'' in
relations with the United States, and a ``fresh discovery'' of the
Soviet Union in other countries, the Central Committee report says.
   ``In our bid for military-strategic parity we occassionally
failed to use opportunities available to attain security for our
nation by political means, and, as a result, allowed ourselves to
be lured into an arms race which could not but affect this
country's social and economic progress and its standing on the
international scene,'' the report says.
   On domestic policy, the program strongly reflects Gorbachev's
priorities for increasing citizen involvement in public affairs and
making individuals more accountable. Its passage shows that the man
who rose to party chief in March 1985 was able to muster the vital
support of the Central Committee.
   Gorbachev was named to present the party program at the meeting
next month at which 5,000 delegates will pass judgment on his
reforms.
   The program indicates the Communists still lay claim to being
the most important force in Soviet society and the only legal
political party. But it says Communist authorities have seriously
weakened local governing bodies and the party itself by seeking to
dominate nearly all aspects of life.
   ``The rights and powers of the representative bodies have been
curtailed and they remain under unwarranted tutelage from party
committees,'' the report says, with governing councils often left
to rubber-stamp decisions already made at higher levels.
   The result has ``sharpened many social development problems,''
the report said. ``It is vital to change this situation radically.''
   The report says changes must extend to the Supreme Soviet, the
nominal parliament which finished a three-day session in the
Kremlin on Thursday.
   Party documents call for an increase in the number of days the
governing councils work, urge that members be relieved of work
obligations to attend such sessions and that the meetings be open
to the public and the media.
   The report indicates that those who do not support Gorbachev's
reforms will be purged from the 19 million-member party.
   Gorbachev in January 1987 called on the party to implement
procedures to ensure that new blood is brought into the leadership,
but he ran into resistance.

<HEAD>Cardinal Renews Opposition To Euthanasia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin urged Roman Catholics
and non-Catholics to oppose efforts to legalize euthanasia, but
said opponents must work for alternatives for the incurably ill
such as hospices.
   ``As individuals and as a society, we have the positive
obligation to protect life,'' Bernardin said in a speech Thursday
to the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of
Chicago Hospitals and Clinics.
   ``We have the negative obligation not to destroy or injure human
life directly, especially the life of the innocent and vulnerable.''
   Bernardin suggested that funding for hospice programs in
hospitals or patients' homes could come from insurance or public
sources.
   ``In this way we can eliminate many of the legitimate concerns
that may motivate people to consider euthanasia, which otherwise
would be unacceptable to them and society,'' he said.
   The cardinal said his position against mercy killing does not
include keeping alive by extraordinary medical procedures or
machines ``those who should be allowed a natural death.''
   He said he was ``convinced that we are not morally obliged to do
everything that is technically possible'' to keep terminally ill
patients alive. ``In other words, there are cases where we would
not be obliged to provide nutrition and hydration.
   He said the challenge was to develop a public policy ``to
protect against an attitude that could erode respect for the
inviolable dignity of human life.''
   But such a policy should not create categories or priorities of
people ``whose lives no longer need be protected,'' he said.
   The cardinal said his remarks were prompted by the increased
public discussion of euthanasia following advances in medical
technology that can artificially prolong a patient's life.
   The issue has been widely debated since the Chicago-based
Journal of the American Medical Association published a letter in
January by an anonymous doctor describing the mercy killing of a
terminally ill cancer patient.
   ``The fear, then, of the pain and discomfort of a life prolonged
inappropriately has led to an erosion of the natural instinct to
preserve one's life,'' the cardinal said.
   ``In certain critical decisions involving living and dying, many
perceive that the focus of concern many no longer be the good of
the patient'' but what will best protect the doctor and hospital
from legal action, he said.

   NATO defense ministers today pledged to
renew efforts to share equitably in the costs of their common
defense. Congress has been complaining that the European allies are
not pulling their weight.
   ``We are determined ... in ensuring that each of us contributes
in the most effective and equitable fashion'' to NATO's joint
defense efforts, the ministers said in a statement at the end of
their two-day meeting here.
   They authorized NATO officials in Brussels to launch an in-depth
review of the responsibilities of the 16 member nations to
determine what changes, if any, must be made. The study is to be
completed by the end of the year.
   In their statement, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
the other North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense chiefs also
expressed support for President Reagan in his summit talks next
week in Moscow.
   The review of NATO's burden-sharing arrangement comes amid
increasingly harsh criticism from some U.S. lawmakers, criticism
the European allies counter by saying their contributions are being
grossly underestimated.
   ``The important thing about burden-sharing is that it not
degenerate to a finger-pointing exercise,'' Carlucci told reporters
after the meeting.
   He said all NATO nations are committed to maintaining their
defense spending and making better use of available funds.
   The ministers also asked Italy to host a U.S. jetfighter wing
that Spain wants off its soil within three years.
   ``All of us hope that the Italian government and parliament will
be able to accept'' the 72 nuclear-capable F-16 jetfighters, NATO
Secretary General Lord Carrington said. A favorable Italian
decision is expected soon.
   The planes, Carrington said, represent ``a considerable portion
of our strength in the southern region.'' They make up the U.S. Air
Force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, now based at the Torrejon air
base near Madrid.
   The Pentagon has said it will have to disband the unit unless a
final decision on moving the planes to another European base is
made by August.
   Carrington told reporters that hesitation by the allies in
arranging the transfer of the F-16s ``would have had the most
appalling effect'' on alliance relations and U.S. congressional
attitudes toward Europe.
   A decision on a specific Italian site for the planes is to be
made later.
   Carlucci estimated the cost of relocating the planes at about
$500 million.
   The United States, under an accord reached in January with
Spain, must remove its F-16s from the Torrejon base by 1991.
   U.S. officials were hopeful the decision to keep the F-16s in
Europe would help blunt congressional complaints the Europeans
don't pay enough for NATO.
   Washington spends 6.7 percent of its gross national product to
maintain the alliance, compared with a 3.3 percent average for the
Europeans.
   The European allies argue a comparison of money figures is
unfair because some of Europe's contributions to NATO are hard to
quantify.
   These include the fact that West Germany and other countries
suffer extensive environmental damage from the intense
concentration of troops and armaments on their soil.
   The Europeans have released figures showing that of NATO's
active duty forces, Europe provides 90 percent of the troops and
artillery, 80 percent of the tanks and jetfighters and two-thirds
of the major warships.
   The NATO defense ministers said they have found no evidence
Moscow is changing ``the doctrine and structure of Soviet forces.''
   The ministers said the Soviet Union continues to maintain
military forces in excess of its defensive needs.
   ``Soviet military expenditures are estimated to represent some
15 to 17 percent of its GNP. The continuing growth of Soviet
military capabilities provides a persuasive reminder of the need
for a credible defense'' on NATO's part, the ministers said in
their communique.
   Carlucci said, ``Despite their rhetoric, we have yet to see any
change'' in Soviet military outlays or in the composition of Soviet
forces.

<TEXT>
   The body of a reputed mobster was found in a
body bag floating in the Hackensack River, with two bullet holes
behind his ear and a credit card left behind to signal his
identity, authorities said.
   The body of John DiGilio, a flamboyant ex-boxer who was a friend
of heavyweight champions Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, was found in
the river by the New York suburb of Carlstadt on Thursday, said
Bergen County Prosecutor Larry McClure.
   ``Sometimes when you live by the sword, you die by the sword,''
said Jeff Bronster, a Justice Department attorney who prosecuted
DiGilio in a recent waterfront racketeering case.
   The corpse was decomposed beyond recognition, but DiGilio was
wearing the same clothes he had on when his wife reported him
missing May 7 and authorities were able to confirm his identity
through fingerprints, McClure said.
   After the 55-year-old Bayonne man was reported missing,
authorities said their sources indicated the reputed Genovese crime
family soldier had been the victim of gangland violence.
   The former longshoreman was a colorful figure who frequently
spoke with reporters, successfully acted as his own attorney in the
racketeering case, often invited his boxing friends to the
courtroom and filed a harassment suit against federal officials.
   Authorities believe that flamboyance may have prompted mob
colleagues unhappy with the attention to seek DiGilio's elimination.
   DiGilio was also to be sentenced on a state loan-sharking
conviction May 19.
   His body was found inside a zipped mortician's bag, with two
bullet holes behind the ear, state police said. A Visa card was
found between DiGilio's legs so that whoever recovered the body
would be able to identify it, said McClure.
   Mob experts have said it was likely DiGilio's death would be
made known to serve as a warning to others.
   Authorities alleged the former middleweight boxer controlled
loan sharking and labor rackets on the Hudson River waterfront, and
had extended his influence into Bergen County to the north.
   Last April, a jury acquitted him of extorting money from a
stevedore company on the Bayonne waterfront in exchange for labor
peace.
   DiGilio was convicted of loan sharking last October after
remaining free for 10 years through a series of delays, most of
them connected to claims of ill health and mental instability.
   He was cleared in 1986 of violating a probationary sentence for
his 1975 conviction for arranging the theft of his FBI file, his
only other conviction. He served nine months in jail for the file
theft.

   A ``little miracle'' who barely filled an
adult's hand when she was born 17 weeks premature last January
should be able to leave the hospital in about two weeks, doctors
say.
   Ashley Lynn Cunningham seems to have escaped the problems that
often plague premature babies, doctors said Thursday.
   Ashley, who weighed just 15{ ounces at birth, now weighs 3
pounds 15{ ounces and measures 16\ inches. She has color in her
cheeks, can hold her head up and cries frequently, although very
softly.
   When she was born, doctors were uncertain whether she would
survive more than a few days. Had things gone according to plan,
Ashley would have been born today.
   ``She's really a little miracle,'' said Deborah Blair, a nurse
in the neonatal intensive care unit at Children's Medical Center,
Ashley's home since birth.
   Ashley should go home in about two weeks, said Dr. Ronald E.
Hoekstra, a specialist on newborns at the hospital.
   The smallest premature infant to survive in the United States
weighed 15 ounces, according to Hoekstra.
   Although Ashley's eyes are not fully developed, doctors don't
believe she will have any problems with sight.
   She has not experienced any hemorrhaging in her brain, another
common problem with premature babies, and doesn't appear to have
any serious breathing difficulties, though she lived on a
respirator for 77 days. Her skin, thin at birth, has developed and
will protect her from infection, Hoekstra said.
   It appears she will live a normal, healthy life, although her
progress will be monitored by doctors periodically until she is 7,
Hoekstra said.
   Five years ago, Ashley probably would not have lived long enough
to go home, Hoekstra said. He said technological advances and
better-trained doctors have made it possible to treat infants such
as Ashley.
   Ashley's grandmother, Joan Cunningham, said she can't count the
prayers she and family members have said for Ashley in the past
four anxiety-filled months. Ashley's medical bills stand at about
$224,000, and will be covered by insurance, hospital officials said.

   An Alitalia jumbo jet carrying about 400
passengers from New York to Milan made an emergency landing in
western France today after a caller said a bomb had been placed
aboard the plane, police said.
   An Alitalia source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
seven people were slightly injured during the emergency evacuation
of the plane. No explosives were immediately found.
   The flight was over France when Alitalia officials in Milan
received the bomb threat. Within 20 minutes, Italian police had
contacted French authorities who instructed the plane to land. The
airliner touched down at 8:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT).
   The passengers, most of whom were American or Italian, were
expected to continue on another flight later today.

   HELSINKI, Finland (AP)_ President Reagan, emerging from
pre-summit isolation, today appealed to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to enter the Western ``House of Democracy'' by embracing
the values enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki agreement.
   Sounding the human rights theme he will stress in their talks in
Moscow, Reagan praised Gorbachev's ``glasnost'' and the openness
that has flourished in his three years at the Kremlin helm.
   But while dissidents are released from labor camps and books and
movies criticizing the communist system gain currency, the
president said, ``Soviet practice does not _ or does not yet _
measure up to Soviet commitment.''
   In the 1975 accord with 34 other nations, the Soviets pledged to
provide more liberty for their people and those in Eastern Europe.
And yet, 13 years later, Reagan said, the cases of divided families
and blocked marriages remain on the East-West agenda, while
Russians trying to emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and
arbitrary rulings.
   ``And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those
who wish to practice their religious beliefs?'' the president asked.
   Reagan spoke in a prepared speech to a Finnish audience in
Finlandia Hall, where the Helsinki Final Agreement was signed in
1975.
   He said he welcomed every sign that the Soviets and their allies
are ready to adopt Western values.
   ``The House of Democracy is a House whose doors are open to
all,'' Reagan said.
   As he spoke, Jewish groups gathered in the Finnish capital to
mount public pressure on Moscow in behalf of Sovie Jews waiting for
exit permits and those seeking wider latitude to teach and practice
their religion.
   A Friday evening Sabbath service was planned outside a Lutheran
church in an ecumencial display of unity.

   Before the speech, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, had lunch with
Finnish President Mauno Koivisto.
   As photographers spun into action, Mrs. Reagan plucked yellow
daisies from the luncheon flower arrangement. The president proudly
wore one as a boutonniere and Mrs. Reagan pinned one on Koivisto's
lapel.
   Reagan played down the significance of the Soviet decision to
cancel one of his meetings with Gorbachev. ``We only had four
meetings at our summit in Washington,'' he told reporters. ``We
have to recognize that their government has normal business that
has to be conducted and we have to schedule accordingly _ that's
what we did when the summit was in our town.''
   Asked if he thought there was anything more important than his
visit with the Soviet leader, Reagan said, ``I don't think there's
anything more important as far as I'm concerned, but they have
business to do.''
   The president, responding to questions about Soviets objections
to some of the people he planned on meeting with in Moscow,
responded simply, ``We do the best we can.''
   In other summit-related developments.
   _A top Soviet arms control official in Moscow called on the
United States to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut
long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of
compromise.
   Viktor Karpov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's arms
control department and a former chief negotiator at Geneva arms
talks, told the Tass news agency the United States had agreed to
compromise on several key issues, but then backed off.
   ``As soon as an issue reaches the American delegation in Geneva,
it gets stuck there,'' he complained.
   _ And an aide to Gorbachev charged that the United States is
violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to
Afghanistan's anti-communist Mujahedeen guerrillas.
   ``They are arming, quite openly, those who want to go on in
their civil war,'' said Yevgeny Primakov, who is head of the
Institute for the World Economy and has acted as a key adviser to
Gorbachev on Afghanistan.
   Before Reagan spoke, U.S. Jewish activists for Soviet Jews urged
the president to remind the Soviets that human rights were
indirectly linked to progress in arms control.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the National Council for Soviet
Jewry, said Jewish emigration is a ``test of whether arms
reductions can succeed.''
   Any agreement ``depends on trust and credibility,'' he told a
news conference. ``No one asks for direct linkage.''
   Abram called the improvement in Jewish emigration figures
``insignificant compared with those who wish to leave ... It's
smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned.''
   The council, an umbrella organization of U.S. Jewish groups
active for Soviet Jewry, brought a 50-member delegation to Helsinki
to draw attention to the issue.
   The 1975 Helsinki agreement signed by the United States, Canada
and 33 European nations including the Soviet Union initially was
viewed skeptically by American political conservatives because it
implicitly accepts East European boundaries set after World War II
in Moscow's favor.
   But in the years since, the Helsinki agreement has served as a
Western platform for chastising the Soviets for deficiencies on
human rights.
   Meanwhile, in Washington, the U.S. Senate today moved toward
ratification of the historic treaty that Reagan and Gorbachev
signed at their December summit eliminating medium range nuclear
missiles.
   Senate leaders said they had the votes to approve the pact.
White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr. was set to rush the
treaty to the president for a ceremonial exchange of the
ratification documents with Gorbachev.
   Human rights is one of Reagan's themes in his fourth summit with
Gorbachev. The president plans to meet Monday with Soviet activists
and refuseniks to underscore his concern.
   Word reached the presidential party Thursday that the Soviets
had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups
scheduled to meet with Reagan at the Danilov monastery on Monday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he did not know
which religious group the Soviets objected to. The meeting, said
Fitzwater, ``is still on as far as I know.''
   On the official level, the Soviets have shown no concern over
the meeting. At a press conference Thursday to discuss the summit,
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky said, ``The U.S.
president ... is certainly free to decide who of Soviet citizens he
finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of
the official events.''
   But, he added, ``This American move is hardly aimed at improving
mutual understanding between the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.''
   Refuseniks demonstrating in Moscow on Thursday said they want
human rights to figure prominently in the Reagan-Gorbachev meetings.
   A Leningrad refusenik, Roald ``Alec'' Zelichonok, said in a
telephone interview that KGB secret police has warned him against
accepting an invitation to meet Reagan on Monday.
   Zelichonok, who has been refused permission to emigrate for more
than 10 years, said he received a letter and telephone call Tuesday
from the U.S. Embassy inviting him to take part in the meeting with
Reagan.
   Shortly after the embassy phone call, he said, a KGB officer
telephoned and said ``in light of security measures around Moscow,
my departure for Moscow will not be permitted.''
   Reagan, in a pre-summit interview with West European
journalists, said he hopes to work out an agreement with Gorbachev
to give American psychiatrists access to Soviet mental hospitals.
   Human rights groups have charged dissidents are committed and
mistreated.
   Other advances in human rights at the summit were hinted by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in a meeting in
Geneva with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   American officials said they reforms would probably ease
restraints on religious practices and education.

   Following the collapse of its negotiating
effort, the Reagan administration is promoting a more active role
for the Central American democracies in encouraging Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender power.
   ``I think it's an excellent idea,'' said Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost, noting that several Central American countries
``have a tremendous storehouse of experience in the transition to
civilian democratic rule.''
   Armacost, the State Department's third-ranking official, spoke
Thursday evening on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' after a day
marked by high-level consultations in Washington and in a number of
Latin American capitals.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said earlier that
U.S. ambassadors from around the hemisphere were instructed to
sound out host governments on their ideas for negotiating a
solution in Panama.
   Panama was the subject of a senior level meeting Thursday at the
White House as well.
   A unilateral U.S. effort to negotiate Noriega out of power
failed on Wednesday when the Defense Forces commander and de facto
ruler backed out of a deal his representatives had negotiated with
State Department envoy Michael Kozak.
   During a photo session in Helsinki today with Finnish President
Mauno Henrik Koivisto, President Reagan indicated that he and his
advisers have reached no decisions about how to proceed on the
Panamanian problem.
   ``We have had no opportunity to consider where we go,'' he said
in response to reporters' questions.
   Reagan also side-stepped a question as to whether he would use
military force in Panama.
   ``I can't answer as to what might be the possibilities,'' Reagan
said, saying it would be wrong to talk about options.
   Pressed to respond to Abrams' refusal to rule out the use of
military force, Reagan said again, ``I won't comment on the
possibilities.''
   As part of a U.S. plan to restore democratic rule in Panama next
year, Noriega was to step down this August and go into temporary
exile. In return, federal drug smuggling indictments against him
were to be dismissed.
   Noriega's rejection of the plan ended the negotiations and
appeared to breathe new life into a Central American initiative in
which Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo apparently would play the
key role.
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan Sosa, who is allied with the
anti-Noriega forces, told reporters after a meeting with State
Department officials that diplomatic contacts had been made with
Cerezo after the collapse of the U.S. effort.
   Cerezo assumed power two years ago as the first elected civilian
president after more than 30 years of military or
military-dominated governments in Guatemala.
   His Washington ambassador, Oscar Padilla, told the ``NewsHour''
program that the ``Central American family'' should initiate an
effort to resolve the Panamanian crisis.
   Joining with Guatemala in any such effort would be the
governments of Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador, all
democracies with close links to the United States.
   The administration has resisted significant involvement by other
hemispheric governments in the Panama issue, but has now shifted
its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative.
   While Armacost indicated there would be a reduced U.S. role in
the future, he noted that the federal indictments against Noriega
imply continued American participation in any effort to reach a
settlement in Panama.
   Although Noriega has little overt support in Latin America,
hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the
administration's approach to the problem.
   One example of this was a meeting of 26 Latin American countries
two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the
U.S. economic sanctions against Panama.

   Libya's news agency claimed an American plane buzzed
a Libyan merchant ship in the Mediterranean near the Spanish coast.
The Pentagon said it knew of no such incident.
   The dispatch by the JANA news agency, monitored in Rome, said a
U.S. 6th Fleet plane flew low over the Libyan freighter Al-Jazair
Thursday afternoon when the ship was 62 miles from Cartagena, Spain.
   ``This provocative act threatens commercial navigation posing a
danger to commercial ships,'' JANA said.
   It added that Libya reserves the right to pursue the matter
before the appropriate international organizations.
   In Washington, Fred Hoffman, a Defense Department spokesman,
said late Thursday the Pentagon was unaware of the Libyan claim and
knew of no contacts involving a U.S. jet and Libyan merchant ship.

   A bomb exploded today outside the
unoccupied summer home of a leading Spanish conservative,
destroying the chalet but causing no injuries, police said.
   The explosion occurred at 4:40 a.m. at the two-story house
belonging to Manuel Fraga, a European Parliament deputy.
   The building is on the outskirts of this seaside town in La
Coruna province in the northwestern region of Galicia.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, police said.
Fraga's wife and family were in Madrid, where the politician has
lived for decades. Fraga's whereabouts were not immediately known.
   In 1977, Fraga, a native of the Galician town of Villalba,
founded the conservative Popular Alliance party, the largest
opposition party in the national Parliament. He resigned as
president 18 months ago.
   On May 21, the Galician branch of the party elected him as its
leader and named him its candidate for president of the region's
autonomous government in elections set for late next year.
   In June 1987 elections, Fraga won election to the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, France.
   Fraga served as tourism and information minister in the 1960s
and Spanish ambassador to Britain in the early 1970s during the
rule of Gen. Francisco Franco. He was also a minister in the first
government appointed by King Juan Carlos after the death of Gen.
Franco in 1975.

   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci said today he planned to meet with his Soviet counterpart
during the Moscow summit to discuss the superpowers' military
doctrines.
   Carlucci and Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov first met
on the topic in March in Bern, Switzerland, following indications
from Moscow that it was putting less emphasis on offensive military
firepower.
   Carlucci indicated that he had taken the initiative to arrange a
second meeting.
   ``He has agreed to such a meeting, and we will have further
discussions on this subject because we obviously want to learn as
much as we can about the Soviet doctrine,'' Carlucci told a news
conference after a two-day meeting of North Atlantic Treaty
Organization defense ministers.
   The NATO ministers said in a joint declaration that despite
Soviet statements indicating the East bloc wanted a less
confrontational relationship with the West, there was not yet
concrete evidence that Moscow had made changes in its military
structure.
   Carlucci was flying to The Hague, the Netherlands today for
talks with Dutch government officials before going to Moscow on
Sunday.

   A former firefighter has been sentenced
to 9{ years in prison for setting a string of fires that caused
$6.5 million damage at a school and two churches in Omak.
   Adrian Julius Howe, 23, had reported one of the fires, helped
set up barricades at another and was seen at three others, said
Okanogan County prosecutor Jack Burchard.
   Howe pleaded guilty to five counts of arson Thursday and
received the maximum sentence, nine years and eight months, from
Superior Court Judge James R. Thomas.
   He pleaded guilty to setting two fires in December at Omak North
Elementary School, which he had attended, and three blazes at two
churches in February.
   An arson charge stemming from a fire that caused $5,000 damage
to a church parsonage was dismissed.
   Burchard and Sheriff Jim Weed said there was no apparent motive
for the fires.
   The fires depleted the rural county's coffers, and county
commissioners have requested state help. A new school is expected
to be ready by fall 1989.
   Howe, a lumber mill employee on the Colville Indian Reservation
and former firefighter for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was
arrested Feb. 25.

<TEXT>
   Midnight was the switching hour for thousands of
suburban Illinois Bell customers whose telephone service went up in
flames on Mother's Day.
   At 11:59 p.m. Thursday, a technician punched a computer button
at the fire-damaged Hinsdale switching station, hooking up half of
Illinois Bell's 35,000 Hinsdale-area customers to a new digital
switching system.
   With that action, these customers should have normal service
again, 2{ weeks after the May 8 fire at the switching station, a
key part of the phone network for northern Illinois, Bell spokesman
Tim Bannon said Thursday.
   ``There might be some shakeout wrinkles, but these people should
have state-of-the-art telephone service,'' including clearer lines
and such options as call waiting and call forwarding previously
unavailable through the 20-year-old equipment at the station,
Bannon said.
   The new equipment, which normally takes 50 weeks to put into
service, was installed in just two weeks by about 250 Illinois Bell
employees working day and night, Bannon said.
   The rest of Illinois Bell's Hinsdale-area customers will
continue to have problems calling outside the area and getting
long-distance service until they can be connected to the new
equipment in early June, Bannon said.
   They remain hooked to the old equipment, which sustained smoke
and fire damage but has been kept operational as a stopgap measure.
   ``The system is getting better, but it is upsetting,'' said Ruth
Collins, of Burr Ridge, whose phone line was one of those on the
old equipment. ``You reach a point after a while where you are
grateful for anything.''
   The fire disrupted service for hundreds of thousands of
residents in Chicago's western suburbs and totally cut off the
35,000 customers for at least a week.
   Bannon said virtually all of the long-distance circuits and
special business lines transmitting computer data that had been
routed through the Hinsdale station had been restored, although it
would still take a few more days to correct some scattered problems.

   Riot police fired volleys of tear gas
and a special martial arts unit charged students today in the
harshest response to a demonstration in 10 days of of
anti-government protests.
   President Roh Tae-woo earlier today ordered a crackdown on
radical groups to safeguard the Olympic Games, which open in Seoul
in September.
   Riot squads moved in quickly when radical students and
dissidents attempted to march on City Hall. Police dispersed the
protesters with tear gas and chased them through the streets.
   Radical students hurled a few firebombs and rocks at police but
most ran when police charged. Police seized and dragged away dozens
of protesters. Some of the protesters were repeatedly punched and
kicked.
   ``Avenge the Kwangju massacre!'' and ``Down with the military
dictatorship!'' students screamed. They also shouted, ``Drive out
the Yankees!''
   The march was the latest to mark the anniversary of the 1980
civil uprising in Kwangju, during which about 200 people were
killed. Students accuse Roh of complicity in the government's
suppression of the 1980 protest.
   About 7,000 riot police with shields, truncheons and tear gas
rifles were deployed in the center of Seoul. Squads of riot police
stood guard on street corners as columns of police swept through
the street.
   The demonstrations also have been anti-American, with protesters
charging that the United States supports military rule in South
Korea and that it forces the partition of the Korean peninsula.
   Meanwhile, a radical student who set himself on fire died from
severe burns, a student committee announced today.
   The committee said Choi Duk-soo, 20, a law student at Dankook
University, will be be buried Monday in a ``Democratic People's
Funeral'' at a still undetermined site.
   Choi doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself
ablaze at a campus just south of Seoul on May 18, the anniversary
of the 1980 uprising.
   Classmates said Choi died Thursday at a Seoul hospital and that
the body was being kept in a student council building on the main
Dankook campus in Seoul.
   On May 15, another student stabbed himself and leaped from a
building in a ritual suicide demanding the release of political
prisoners and reunification of the Korean peninsula.
   The death triggered a series of violent anti-government
demonstrations.
   Roh said such protests imperil the security of the Olympic
Games, which open in Seoul in September.
   Roh's call for a crackdown on such groups came during a meeting
of top law-enforcement officials to review security in and around
the Korean peninsula.
   ``It is imperative that all possible measures be taken to
forestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups to guarantee
the safety of the Olympics and their successful staging,'' Roh told
the meeting.
   It was the first national security meeting Roh has called since
he took office on Feb. 25. Among those attending the meeting were
top military and police officials and several Cabinet ministers.
   Describing the coming months as ``the most dangerous'' since the
Korean War in the early 1950's, Roh warned that terrorist groups
may stage attacks well before the Games open Sept. 17.
   The president expressed concern that North Korea would try to
sabotage the Olympics, but said attention should also be paid to
``left-leaning domestic radicals'' bent on violence.

   Fire broke out early today in the engine
room of a British passenger ferry in the English Channel, but it
was quickly put out and no one was hurt, officials said.
   The 3,335-ton European Trader, carrying 85 passengers and crew,
was being towed to the French coast, according to its owners, P and
O European Ferries Ltd. It maintained power, however, with an
emergency generator.
   It was the second blaze this week aboard a British ferry plying
the channel between England and the Continent, the world's busiest
waterway.
   On Monday, one crewman died and another was seriously burned
when a fire started in the engine room of the 5,917-ton Seafreight
Freeway, owned by Sealink U.K. Ltd. The fire on the freight ferry
was blamed on a fractured fuel pipe.
   Both fires occurred as the ferries sailed between this southeast
England port and the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. It was outside
Zeebrugge that the British ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized
in March 1987, killing 193 people.
   P and O said the blaze in the engine room of the European Trader
started before dawn today, 20 miles northwest of Dunkirk, France.
Crewmen evacuated the engine room as it filled with smoke.
   Helicopters flew out carrying firefighters and rescue workers,
and tugs and a lifeboat were sent to the area. But the ship's
captain reported that the fire was smothered by an on-board
firefighting system activated when the crew evacuated the engine
room.
   There was no immediate indication what caused the blaze.
   The European Trader was the first vessel to break a continuing
strike on P and O's lucrative Dover-Calais route when it sailed to
the French port on May 14, the first such voyage for 15 weeks.
   Today, the ferry was carrying 44 passengers, 41 crewmen and 50
freight trucks from Zeebrugge to Dover, P and O said.

   Police today questioned a suspected Japanese Red
Army terrorist about the 1970 hijacking of a Japanese airliner to
North Korea, a police spokesman said.
   Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, also will be questioned about whether the
leftist terrorist group was planning any new terrorist action, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shibata, 16 years old in 1970, was one of nine suspected Red
Army members who hijacked a Japan Air Lines Boeing 727 to the North
Korean capital of Pyongyang. He was arrested in Tokyo on May 6.
   Authorities said they brought Shibata to Tokyo today in an
unusual helicopter airlift from his hometown in western Japan to
ensure his safety. He was taken to Tokyo's Metropolitan Police
Department, where questioning began.
   The Kobe Prosecutor's Office so far has charged him only with
using someone else's passport.
   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
prosecutors will determine whether to charge him in the hijacking.
The investigation also is looking into current Red Army activity,
he said.
   Two of the remaining seven hijackers declared in Pyongyang on
Tuesday that they were ready to return to Japan.
   ``We can't leave him (Shibata) alone in his present situation,''
declared Moriaki Wakabayashi, 41, in his first interview with
Japanese television.
   Police believe Shibata returned to Japan in April 1985 by an
unknown route from North Korea, and that another member of the
hijacking team died in Pyongyang of illness.
   Police have said Shibata worked part time in Tokyo and obtained
the phony passport in Yokohama in July 1986 using the name of a
Kobe man with Japanese and North Korean citizenship. The man
returned to North Korea in 1972 without disclaiming his Japanese
citizenship, they said.
   According to the Kobe Prosecutor's Office, Shibata would face up
to three years in prison if convicted of using a false passport. A
convicted hijacker not charged with murder in Japan is subject to a
maximum term of life in prison.
   Authorities said Shibata has refused to cooperate with police,
but that travel records show he went several times to Europe using
the other man's passport.
   The police spokesman said today that it was too early to say
whether Europe was being used as a Red Army base or whether North
Korea had aided the group in any way. Other police officials have
said Shibata could not have left North Korea without official
government permission.
   Osamu Maruoka, the Red Army's reputed No. 2 man who was arrested
in Japan last November, and Yu Kikumura, a suspected Red Army
member arrested in the United States in April for possessing
explosives, are both believed to have traveled in Europe before
their arrests.
   Following Maruoka's arrest, investigations showed he had
reserved a one-way ticket to travel last Decemer to Seoul, the site
of the 1988 Summer Olympics.
   Two more suspected Red Army members, Junzo Okudaira and Fusako
Shigenobu, the Red Army's alleged leader, are being sought by
police in Italy for suspected involvement in a car bomb attack in
Naples in April.
   The arrests and bombing have sparked speculation that the
long-dormant terrorist group is planning a comeback.

   A northeastern Indian state appealed for
food and other relief supplies after flooding killed 24 people and
drove thousands of people from their homes, an Indian newspaper
reported today.
   Flooding began earlier this week along the Brahmaputra River and
its tributaries in Assam state, the Indian Express said.
   It said Assam's chief minister, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, sought
food and other supplies for more than 100 relief camps set up to
house families driven from their homes.
   Heavy rainfall has hampered rescue operations, state-run All
India Radio reported. Runoff from melting snow in the Himalayas
also is swelling the river system.

   Two faculty members accused of offering A's
to students at California State University's Northridge campus in
exchange for selling $100 in raffle tickets have been notified they
will be fired, their attorney said.
   University officials declined comment Thursday on the case
against Pan-African studies Professor Eleazu S. Obinna and
instructor Willie J. Bellamy.
   Obinna, a 17-year member of the department, and Bellamy, a
first-year instructor, were accused by students of offering A's in
three African history and culture classes in exchange for selling
raffle tickets, the university said last month.
   The raffle money went to Obinna's nonprofit United Crusade
Foundation, which he founded in 1982, the university said.
   The university April 28 canceled the three independent studies
courses, with an enrollment of more than 180. Students had reported
that the courses required no classroom attendance and assigned no
course work.
   Francis E. Smith, the faculty members' lawyer, said Thursday the
letters alerted Obinna and Bellamy of the university's intent to
fire them.
   ``We intend to vigorously oppose any effort on the part of the
university to dismiss either Dr. Obinna or Professor Bellamy,''
Smith said.
   The Nigerian-born Obinna, 54, denied any wrongdoing last month
and said the charges were ``concocted by he administration.'' He
said he required 45 hours of course work and graded students on
participation in minority community affairs.
   Bellamy has declined comment.
   The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office announced
Tuesday it was conducting a separate investigation. Raffles are
illegal under state law.
   In addition, the state attorney general's office is
investigating whether donations to Obinna's foundation were
improperly diverted. City records show the foundation has spent
$120 for the needy since its inception.
   Obinna and Bellamy have seven days to request a hearing with an
examiner. It then would be up to the university president to decide
whether to uphold, modify or reject any discipline recommended by
the examiner.
   The Northridge campus is 25 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.

   Hundreds of Syrian troops moved into
Beirut's southern slums today to end a three-week bloodbath between
rival Shiite Moslem militias.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
Syrian-armed Amal militia stopped shooting as the deployment began.
   Syria's move was expected to increase pressure for the release
of 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, who are believed
to be held in the slums by Shiite factions linked to Hezbollah.
   Hours after Syria announced Thursday that its troops would move
in, gunmen ambushed a car carrying four Syrian generals. All four
escaped injury.
   About 900 soldiers wearing bulletproof vests over their combat
fatigues advanced on foot from Beirut's airport highway into the
Ghobeiri and Shiyah districts.
   A half-hour earlier, shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire
in the embattled slums resounded across Beirut. Police had no word
on what touched off the flareup, which occurred despite pledges by
both factions to observe a cease-fire.
   The Syrians advanced in three groups, each made up of 300
infantrymen carrying machine guns and shoulder-fired grenade
launchers. The first group was followed by 50 Lebanese policemen
carrying automatic rifles.
   The Syrians set up four or five checkpoints along a
disengagement line between the Amal-held Shiyah neighborhood and
Hezbollah-controlled Ghobeiri.
   Wailing women greeted the Syrians as they moved in by showering
them with rice in a traditional gesture of welcome.
   ``Animals, they're all animals, animals killing animals,'' a man
standing in front of his bomb-shattered house shouted in English
when he saw Western correspondents covering the Syrian advance.
   His house was seized by Hezbollah fighters during the final
phase of the savage street fighting that erupted May 6. Police say
296 people have been killed and 1,000 wounded in the turf war.
   There was no immediate word when the Syrians planned to send
tanks and other armor into the devastated districts to enforce the
cease-fire.
   Syria's military intelligence chief in Lebanon, Brig. Gen. Ghazi
Kenaan, said Syria would deploy 7,500 soldiers in the
16-square-mile slums, about 90 percent of which are controlled by
Hezbollah.
   Kenaan was one of four generals riding in a Mercedes 500 that
was hit by dozens of bullets as it traveled through Ghobeiri on
Thursday. Neither the generals nor their bodyguards were hurt, the
Syrians reported.
   The attack came just hours after Kenaan announced Syrian forces
would enter the slums today.
   Police said Hezbollah militiamen raked Kenaan's bulletproof dark
blue Mercedes with machine gun fire as it drove through Ghobieri.
   According to police, Hezbollah forces claimed they were not
notified that Kenaan's motorcade would be going through Ghobeiri,
although police said notification was made.
   Also in the car were Maj. Gen. Saeed Bairakdar, commander of
Syria's forces in Lebanon; Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, chief of
military intelligence for the Beirut area; and Brig Gen. Zuheir
Musattat.
   President Hafez Assad's Syrian government announced on Thursday
that a truce agreement has been reached with all parties concerned,
including Iran and Hezbollah, to end the carnage.
   ``Ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages and
Syria will spare no effort to secure their release, regardless of
their nationality,'' a Syrian official told The Associated Press in
Damascus.
   A source at the Syrian command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the deployment operation would be carried out in
two stages today and Saturday.
   The first involves the establishment of buffer zones in key
positions along the confrontation lines in the neighborhoods of
Shiyah, Ghobeiri, Mesharrafieh and Haret Hreik today, he said.
   The deployment in the rest of the slums would be completed on
Saturday, including Hezbollah's main strongholds of Bir el-Abed and
Hay Madi, the source added.
   The hostages are believed to be imprisoned in Hezbollah's Hay
Madi barracks.
   Both Amal and Hezbollah have said they would withdraw their
fighters once the Syrians move in and keep only political and
information offices.
   It was not clear whether the hostages were part of the truce
deal. But the Iranian assistant foreign minister, Ali Mohammed
Besharati, predicted last week that the hostage problem would be
solved after peace was restored in south Beirut.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, embroiled in civil
war for 13 years. Although an ally of Iran, it appears anxious that
Iran's brand of Islamic fundamentalism may be getting too much of a
foothold in Lebanon.

   A fire caused minor damage in a restaurant
being built adjacent to the most popular tourist attraction in the
nation's capital.
   The two-alarm fire began Thursday afternoon near the Air and
Space Museum sending heavy smoke into the air but it did not spread
to the popular museum where countless irreplaceable exhibits of
aviation and space history are on display.
   ``Seeing all that smoke coming out of it, it was a frightening
sight,'' said Madeleine Jacobs, a spokeswoman for the museum.
   She said, however, the fire wasn't as serious as it appeared and
visitors to the museum were not disturbed.
   ``Apparently a spark from a welder's torch ignited some paper
that was being used to line the windows,'' said Leo Givs of the
District of Columbia Fire Department. No injuries were reported.

   A House panel has approved a bill to limit the
amount of advertising that may be shown during children's
television programs.
   The House Commerce and Energy Committee on Thursday voted 39-3
to send the measure to the House floor, where it is expected to win
approval.
   The bill passed by the House committee would limit TV stations
to no more than 10{ minutes of commercials per hour during
children's shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during these
programs on weekdays.
   The measure is a bipartisan compromise stripped of earlier
proposals to prohibit programs called ``program-length
commercials'' that are built around toy manufacturers' products.
Senate legislation on children's TV would bar these programs.

   The Immigration and Naturalization Service acted Thursday
following an appeal last week by 42 members of Congress that it

   INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson said agency district directors

<HEAD>Cambodia Says Khmer Rouge Obstacle To Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government
urged the world today to respond to Vietnam's troop pullout by
taking steps to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power in
Cambodia.
   Vietnam said Thursday it would withdraw its 50,000 troops, or
what it said was half its force in Cambodia, between June and
December as part of its plan of a complete pullout by 1990. The
remaining troops are to be placed under the command of the
pro-Vietnamese government, it said.
   A statement issued by the Cambodian Foreign Ministry said today
that attempts to help the Khmer Rouge return to power created a
``very dangerous obstacle'' to holding peace talks with the three
Cambodian guerrilla groups that oppose Vietnam's occupation. The
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge is the largest and most powerful of
these groups.
   ``It is imperative to absolutely eliminate this obstacle at a
time when more than half the Vietnamese volunteer troops have
already been withdrawn from Cambodia,'' said the statement, which
was carried by the official Cambodian radio, monitored in Bangkok.
   It said the Khmer Rouge must be tried by the World Court and
also denied the use of sanctuaries in foreign territory.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 after a series of bloody
border clashes with the communist Khmer Rouge government, which
killed millions of people during its nearly four-year rule. Vietnam
installed a pro-Hanoi government.
   The radio of the Khmer Rouge dismissed Cambodia's statement as
propaganda and said it has never seen a single Vietnamese soldier
leave Cambodia. It urged the world to continue pressuring Hanoi to
withdraw all its forces unconditionally as demanded in annual
United Nations resolutions.
   The Cambodian government statement also said Vietnam's decision
to pull its troops in Cambodia 18 miles back from the Thai border
showed neighborly intentions that Thailand should match. Vietnamese
and Thai forces frequently have clashed along the border.
   Thailand said Vietnam's decision to pull out of Cambodia
resulted from Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda's talks last
week with leaders in Moscow.
   Thailand and its allies in the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations are trying to arrange informal talks in Indonesia among the
warring Cambodian factions, Vietnam and other concerned countries.
   Vietnam's official Radio Hanoi said Thursday the guerrillas and
their backers should agree to a political settlement because ``the
Cambodian issue will no longer exist after 1990,'' when the last
troops leave. The pro-Vietnamese government increasingly is able to
control the country by itself, said a text of the broadcast
obtained today.
   It said the key issue is to guarantee that the Khmer Rouge
doesn't return and that this is the responsibility of China, the
United States, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   Vietnam's withdrawal would be by far the largest of annual
pullouts Vietnam claims to have made since 1982. The previous
withdrawals had already reduced by half the force that was
originally in Cambodia, Hanoi says.

   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker, who won
wide praise for turning around a department reeling from corruption
and the MOVE disaster, says he is resigning after 2{ years to spend
more time with his family,
   ``Commissioner Tucker has brought integrity and pride to a
department in crisis,'' Mayor W. Wilson Goode said Thursday in
accepting the resignation. ``He has left his significant mark of
professionalism.''
   When Tucker, 48, a former Secret Service agent who spent two
decades guarding government figures, took over the 6,700-member
force in 1986, morale was poor and the department was held in low
esteem.
   It was just seven months after the May 1985 confrontation with
the radical group MOVE in which police dropped a bomb that set fire
to a neighborhood. Eleven people in the MOVE house died and 61
homes were destroyed.
   Morale also was suffering from the convictions of 34 officers,
including a deputy commissioner, accused of taking bribes from vice
figures.
   Tucker, the first outsider in more than 60 years to head the
department, took the post saying he would stay two to three years.
   ``It was a high honor and privilege to serve the city,'' Tucker
said Thursday. ``Our department has made progress. We have moved
forward together. It has been a team effort with the officers, the
city and the public.''
   Tucker said he wants to spend more time with his wife and two
children, who live in nearby Medford Lakes, N.J. He said the city's
residency requirements and the demands of the job allowed little
time with his family.
   He has been occupying a downtown apartment because of a law
requiring city residence for all employees. ``It personally took
its toll,'' he said.
   Tucker denied speculation that a budget shortfall for fiscal
1989 which might result in police layoffs played any role in his
resignation, which is effective June 10. Tucker has taken a job
with a bank in Philadelphia.
   The mayor said he would appoint a successor from within the
department. Among the leading candidates are the two deputy
commissioners, Robert Armstrong and Willie Williams.
   If appointed, Williams would be Philadelphia's first black
police commissioner.
   Tucker, who was a police officer in Rahway, N.J., before joining
the Secret Service in 1965, spent four years providing security for
President Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline, and her two children. He was
agent in charge of the Philadelphia office before resigning in 1985
for a job in private business.

   Three Iranian speedboats raided a Maltese
freighter today and left it burning in the Strait of Hormuz, then
fired at a press helicopter when it approached the site of the
attack, shipping executives said.
   Iran earlier claimed it killed or wounded 10,000 Iraqi troops in
land battles east of Basra.
   The press helicopter chartered by the American television
network CBS was not hit.
   Shipping executives had said a second ship was hit but later
retracted that report.
   The executives said the 18-member crew of the 18,000-ton Don
Miguel abandoned ship after the 8 a.m. attack. An Omani warship
sailing nearby rescued them.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
crew, all South Koreans, were transferred to a salvage tugboat of
the Dutch company Smit and appeared to have been unharmed.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English, who was aboard a
helicopter in the area, said a second Smit salvage tugboat was
battling the flames as they ravaged the freighter's stern.
   The executives said the Iranians fired at the helicopter
chartered by CBS when it tried to get close to the site of the
attack. But they said the four volleys of gunfire only hit the
water and did not damage the aircraft.
   It was the second Iranian raid in 12 hours and the fourth in 10
days.
   On May 3 Washington broadened the duties of the U.S. Navy in the
gulf, allowing American warships to intervene in attacks on
commercial ships, even if they are not sailing under the Stars and
Stripes.
   The executives said no American warships were believed to have
been in the vicinity of the Don Miguel when it was raided.
   All the recent Iranian attacks took place near the Iranian
offshore Larak oil terminal and all the ships were sailing to or
from Saudi Arabian ports.
   Iraqi jets raided Larak on May 14, hitting five tankers,
including the world's largest, the Seawise Giant.
   Iraq strikes Iran's oil facilities to pressure Tehran into
ending its 7{-year-old war with Iraq. Iran retaliates by attacking
neutral commercial shipping.
   In the land battle, Tehran radio late Thursday quoted a
statement by Iran's Revolutionary Guards saying that in the
fighting east of Basra, ``severe casualties were inflicted on the
enemy and more than 10,000 of them were killed or wounded.''
   It was the first time either side has reported any casualty
figures in this week's fighting, centered in the area between
Basra, a southern Iraqi city, and the Iranian border town of
Shalamcheh.
   Western military analysts say an estimated 35,000 to 40,000
Iraqi troops took part in the operation, retaking chunks of Iraqi
territory in the third military defeat for Iran since mid-May.
   Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said
Iranian forces were continuing to resist the Iraqis from new
positions.
   Earlier the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, admitted that Iranian forces ``had to retreat from parts of
the area they had captured earlier.''
   It said the Iranians were now in ``new positions'' but gave no
details, in one of Tehran's rare acknowledgements that it had
suffered a military setback.
   The radio also reported ``large numbers'' of volunteers were
dispatched to the front from 19 cities across Iran in the 24 hours
following the Iraqi offensive.
   On April 18, Iraq recaptured its Faw Peninsula, which had been
occupied by Iranian forces since early 1986. On the same day, U.S.
forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank or damaged six
Iranian warships in the gulf.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters,
arrived in Bahrain early today as part of a trip to the Middle East
for consultations on the Iraq-Iran war and the Palestinian problem.
   Walters already has visited Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq,
Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

   A former South African opposition

   Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, former head of the Progressive
Federal Party and an apartheid opponent, met with four ANC national
executive committee members, including information and publicity
head Thabo Mbeki.
   The same four met Thursday with an eight-member delegation from
South Africa's anti-apartheid National Democratic Movement.
   The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting the white-minority
government in South Africa. Outlawed in South Africa, it is based
in Lusaka, Zambia.
   After Thursday's meeting, the two sides said they sharply
disagreed about the use of violence to bring about reforms in their
homeland.
   Slabbert spoke briefly to reporters during a break in his
discussions with ANC officials at a Frankfurt hotel.
   ``It's an informal discussion on a wide range of topics,''
Slabbert said. ``We're just a group of concerned South Africans
talking.''
   Slabbert said that in the talks he had not tried to persuade the
ANC to ``change strategies'' and try to become involved in local
and national politics.
   The South African government has refused to lift its ban on the
ANC unless it renounces violence.
   Slabbert is director of planning and policy for the Institute
for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa, an anti-apartheid
think tank he helped found. He is widely viewed as his country's
most charismatic white anti-apartheid leader.
   Five members from the National Democratic Movement delegation
attended today's meeting, said Harald Pakendorf, a member of the
delegation.
   Wynand Malan, leader of the delegation and a parliamentary
member, was asked after the Thursday meeting if the two
anti-apartheid groups had discussed the use of violence.
   ``We voiced not only our position but our difference over that
strategy,'' Malan told reporters.
   ``We also got an explanation from (the African National
Congress) again as to the origin of the armed struggle. We can
understand from their perspective exactly what they are saying, but
from our position we are still fundamentally in disagreement to
it,'' Malan said.
   He said he wants to continue talks with the banned group to
resolve differences.
   In a joint statement, the two groups said: ``Common ground was
found in relation to the kind of South Africa we would like to
see.''
   ``However, there were important differences with respect to some
aspects of the strategy through which this could be achieved,'' the
statement continued.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Faculty of 14 Resigns When Told Jewish Teachers Must Be Faithful
to Christ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 13 teachers at a church-run nursery
school have resigned after its governing board announced that all
faculty members, Christians and Jews alike, must profess faith in
Jesus Christ or quit.
   Five teachers and about half of the 82 toddlers at the First
Presbyterian Church of Sherman Oaks are Jewish, school director
Wendy Cummings said. A 23-year school employee, Ms. Cummings also
turned in her resignation Thursday.
   ``I am a Presbyterian, but I cannot conduct a school where I
have to explain to children that their teacher has been fired
because she is Jewish,'' she said. ``I do not believe in what they
are doing.''
   The governing board of the church voted Tuesday to change the
school from a non-religious nursery school to a ministry of the
church that teaches Christian principles, said Joe Kelly, clerk of
the church's 21-member board.
   As part of that plan, all teachers working by September 1989
must ``profess the Christian faith as a condition of employment,''
he said.
   ``Those who teach Christian teaching should subscribe to those
teachings themselves,'' the Revs. John and Pamela Powell, pastors
of the church, said in a statement. ``Christian teaching is not
simply an academic matter but a matter of an entire world view.''
   Some of the Jewish teachers accused the church of anti-Semitism.
   ``We were devastated,'' said Marilyn Freitag, who has taught at
the school for 14 years. ``I take it as a personal assault. They're
saying they don't want the Jewish influence.''
   The Powells denied the church was being anti-Semitic.
   ``The school will continue to be open to children of all races.
We are only trying to reorganize the teachings of the school,''
Powell said. Jewish teachers could remain if they are ``confessing
Christians,'' he said.
   Officials of the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission
and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish civil
rights organization, said the policy appeared to be legal.
   Attorney Robert Olmos of the employment commission said hiring
practices by religious institutions were exempted from the 1964
Civil Rights Act.
   The resignations are effective June 15, the end of the academic
year.
   Actress Pat Klous of television's ``Love Boat,'' singer Debbie
Boone and former astronaut Gordon Cooper are among parents whose
children either attend or attended the school.
   Ms. Klous, who is not Jewish, said she would withdraw her child.
``I'm heartbroken,'' she said.
   ``I can't see supporting a school where I don't believe in what
they do,'' said Cooper, whose wife is a volunteer substitute.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar expects that a referendum can be held soon in the
disputed Western Sahara after 15 years of war, an aide said today.
   Perez de Cuellar made the assessment after meeting there today
with Mohamed Abdelaziz, president of what anti-Moroccan fighters
call the Saharawi Republic, said the aide, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The aide spoke in Addis Ababa, where African leaders attending
an Organization of African Unity summit went into a closed session
to discuss the issue.
   He said the U.N. chief ``expects to be able to hold a referendum
in Western Sahara within the next few months.'' Aides also said de
Cuellar was confident of resolving the war between Abdelaziz's
Polisario Front fighters and Morocco.
   The peace process accelerated with this month's resumption of
diplomatic relations between Morocco and Algeria, the Polisario
Front's main backer.
   ``Our contacts with the parties encourage us to believe that,
given their continued cooperation and political will, a peaceful
solution to the problem can be found,'' the aide said.
   Morocco annexed the mineral-rich Western Sahara, previously a
Spanish province, in 1979. Morocco broke with the Organization of
African Unity in 1984 when the 50-member body recognized the
rebels' Saharawi Republic as a full member state.

   Baton-wielding riot police
today arrested 245 black employees of a luxury hotel as they
demonstrated against a U.S. company that is canceling its contract
to manage the hotel.
   The Westin Hotels Co. of Seattle had managed the Carlton Hotel
for 15 years. It reportedly decided to pull out of South Africa
because of pressure from the anti-apartheid movement.
   Hotel guests, including a contingent of travel agents from North
America and Europe, looked on in amazement as police ordered the
chanting protesters to disperse, then moved in with batons to begin
the arrests.
   Police, who have authority to declare virtually any outdoor
gathering illegal, said 142 men and 103 women were arrested. The
workers were released several hours later after the hotel
management paid $50 fines for each worker. Payment of the fines
acknowledges guilt for the gathering.
   During the first arrests, some protesters were beaten and flung
into police vans. Other employees _ including cooks in chef's hats
and a doorman in top hat and tails _ voluntarily moved toward the
vehicles to be taken to police headquarters.
   Westin announced last month that it would withdraw on June 6 as
manager of the Carlton.
   Workers carried signs accusing Westin of exploitation and told
reporters that the firm should pay them severance bonuses as part
of its disinvestment.
   The Carlton, one of the two luxury hotels in central
Johannesburg, is owned by the property division of Anglo American
Corp., South Africa's largest conglomerate.
   Larry Macartney, the hotel's marketing director, He said the
workers' contracts were with the hotel owners, not with Westin, and
were not affected by the disinvestment. He said the management
wanted to meet with the workers to explain the situation and hear
complaints.
   Before the confrontation with police, the protesters _ including
maids, bellhops and waiters _ trotted around the block on which the
Carlton and an adjoining high-rise office building stand.
   Inside the hotel, white employees served breakfast in the
restaurant and made beds, while departing guests carried their own
luggage.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's
speech at Finlandia Hall on Friday:
   Thank you. Thank you all very much. Mr. President, Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Prime Minister, and ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by
saying thank you to our hosts, the Finnish government, the
Paasikivi Society and the League of Finnish-American Societies.
   It's a particular honor for me to come here today. This year,
the year of friendship, as Congress has proclaimed it, between the
United States and Finland; this year marks the 350th anniversary of
the arrival of the first Finns in America and the establishment of
a small Scandinavian colony near what is today Wilmington, Delaware
_ an ancient people in a new world.
   And that is the story not only of those Finns, but of all the
peoples who braved the seas to settle in and build my country, a
land of freedom for a nation of immigrants.
   Yes, they founded a new world. But as they crossed the oceans,
the mountains and the prairies, those who made America carried the
old world in their hearts _ the old customs, the family ties, and
most of all, the belief in God, a belief that gave them the moral
compass and ethical foundation by which they explored an uncharted
frontier and constructed a government and nation of, by and for the
people.
   And so although we Americans became a new people, we also remain
an ancient one, for we're guided by ancient and universal values,
values that Prime Minister Holkeri spoke of in Los Angeles this
February, when, after recalling Finland's internationally
recognized position of neutrality, he added that Finland is tied to
Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights. And let me
add here that for America, those ties are also the bonds of our
friendship.
   America respects Finland's neutrality. We support Finland's
independence. We honor Finland's courageous history. We value the
creative statesmanship that has been Finland's gift to world peace.
And in this soaring hall, which is the great architect Alvar Alto's
statement of hope for Finland's future, we reaffirm our hope and
faith that the friendship between our nations will be unending.
   We are gathered here today in this hall, because it was here,
almost thirteen years ago, that the 35 nations of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe signed the Helsinki Final Act, a
document that embodies the same ethical and moral principles and
the same hope for a future of peace that Finns and so many other
European immigrants gave America.
   The Final Act is a singular statement of hope. Its three baskets
touch on almost every aspect of East-West relations and taken
together form a kind of map through the wilderness of mutual
hostility to open fields of peace and to a common home of trust
among all of our sovereign nations, neutrals, nonaligned and
Alliance members alike. The Final Act sets new standards of conduct
for our nations and provided the mechanisms by which to apply those
standards.
   Yes, the Final Act goes beyond arms control, once the focus of
international dialogue. It reflects a truth that I have so often
noted: nations do not distrust each other because they are armed;
they are armed because they distrust each other. The Final Act
grapples with the full range of our underlying differences and
deals with East-West relations as an interrelated whole.
   It reflects the belief of all our countries that human rights
are less likely to be abused when a nation's security is less in
doubt, that economic relations can contribute to security, but
depend on the trust and confidence that come from increasing ties
between our peoples, increasing openness and increasing freedom,
and that there is no true international security without respect
for human rights.
   I can hardly improve on the words that President Koivisto used
in this hall two years ago when he recalled that security is more
than the protection of borders and social structures. It is
emphasized in the Final Act that individual persons who live in the
participating states have to feel in their own lives security which
is based on respect for fundamental human rights and basic freedoms.
   And beyond establishing these integrated standards, the Final
Act establishes a process for progress. It sets up a review
procedure to measure performance against standards and despite the
doubts of the critics, for the past 13 years, the signatory states
have mustered the political will to keep on working and making
progress. Let me say that it adds _ well, it seems particularly
appropriate to me that the Final Act is associated so closely with
this city and this country.
   More than any other diplomatic document, the Final Act speaks to
the yearning that Finland's long-time President, Urno Kekkonen,
spoke of more than a quarter century ago when he said in his words,
``It's the fervent hope of the Finnish people that barriers be
lowered all over Europe and that progress be made along the road of
European unity.'' And he added that this was, as he put it, ``for
the good of Europe and thus of humanity as a whole.''
   Well, those were visionary words. That vision inspired and
shaped the drafting of the Final Act and continues to guide us
today. Has the Final Act and what we call ``the Helsinki process''
worked or not? Many say it hasn't, but I believe it has.
   In the security field, I would point to the most recent fruit of
the process, the Stockholm document of Confidence and
Security-Building Measures in Europe. This agreement lays down the
rules by which our 35 states notify each other of upcoming military
activities in Europe, provides detailed information on these
activities in advance and lets the others know their plans for very
large military activities one or two years in advance and agrees
not to hold such maneuvers unless this notice is given, invites
observers to their larger military activities and permits on-site
inspections to make sure the agreement is honored.
   I'm happy to note that since our representatives shook hands to
seal this agreement a year and a half ago, all 35 states have, by
and large, honored both the letter and the spirit of the Stockholm
document. The Western and neutral and non-aligned states have set
strong example in providing full information about their military
activities. In April, Finland held its first military activity
subject to the Stockholm notification requirements and voluntarily
invited observers to it.
   The Soviet Union and its allies also have a generally good
record of implementation, though less forthcoming than the West.
Ten on-site inspections have been conducted so far, and more and
more states are exercising their right to make such inspections. I
can't help but believe that making inspections a matter of routine
business would improve openness and enhance confidence.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Dies After Receiving Jarvik Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old who doctors said was the youngest
recipient of a Jarvik-7 artificial heart died eight hours after it
was implanted as a stopgap measure until a donor heart could be
found.
   Eric Rutkowski died Thursday night after developing pulmonary
edema, or fluid in the lungs, said St. Luke's Hospital spokeswoman
Diane De La Santos.
   The seventh-grader had suffered since February from viral
myocarditis, which destroys the heart, De La Santos said. He was
admitted to the hospital May 17 for evaluation for a transplant,
but his condition deteriorated rapidly. The decision to implant the
Jarvik-7 came Wednesday after an urgent request to the national
network for a donor heart came up empty, De La Santos said.
   Rutkowsky was the youngest ever recipient of the artificial
heart, used initially as a permanent heart replacement but now
employed as a bridge to a transplant.
   Christopher Larson, 15, of Esdaile, Wis., received a Jarvik-7 in
1987 at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. He received a
donor heart a month later.
   St. Luke's is one of only 15 medical centers nationwide
permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use the
Jarvik-7.

<HEAD>Sikhs Kill Nine, Government Plans to Raze Houses Around Golden
Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists killed nine people in
the northern state of Punjab today. The government said it would
cut a 100-yard buffer zone around the Golden Temple to keep
militants out of Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   On Thursday, President Ramaswami Venkataraman issued an
ordinance making it illegal for temples and other religious sites
to be used for political purposes. It also would make harboring a
wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine.
   Home Minister Buta Singh, whose ministry is responsible for
internal security, said today the government would clear houses and
shops from around the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar.
   The actions were aimed at stemming the rising violence by Sikh
extremists, who have been waging a guerrilla war in Punjab since
1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, say they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   The latest killings raised to more than 1,180 the number of
deaths blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the
year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people died.
   The decision to cut a corridor around the walled shrine follows
a 10-day siege by police and paramilitary troops to drive Sikh
radicals from the temple.
   The siege ended May 18 with the surrender of the last of 200
Sikh extremists and sympathizers from the complex. At least 46
people were killed in the confrontation, most of them militants.
   The police continue to keep a cordon around the shrine, but
their security efforts are hampered because dozens of shops, houses
and narrow alleys beside the complex provide cover for militants
moving around in the area.
   P. Chidambaram, Singh's deputy, told the news conference that
about 700 families and 300 shops would be displaced. He said the
government would set up a resettlement program for those forced to
move.

<HEAD>HELSINKI: enhance confidence.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nor was Stockholm the end of the process. In Vienna, all 35
signatory states are considering how to strengthen the confidence
and security-building measures in the context of a balanced outcome
at the CSCE follow-up meeting that includes significant progress on
human rights.
   In the economic field, as in the security field, I believe there
has been progress, but of a different kind. Issues and negotiations
regarding security are not simple, but military technology makes
arms and armies resemble each other enough so that common measures
can be confidently applied. Economic relations, by contrast, are
bedeviled by differences in our systems. Perhaps increases in
non-strategic trade can contribute to better relations between East
and West.
   But it's difficult to relate the state-run economies of the East
to the essentially free market economies of the West. Perhaps some
of the changes underway in the state-run economies will equip them
better to deal with our businessmen and open new arenas for
cooperation. But our work on these issues over the years has
already made us understand that differences in systems are serious
obstacles to expansion of economic ties, and since understanding of
unpleasant realities is part of wisdom, that, too, is part of
progress.
   The changes taking place in the Eastern countries of the
continent go beyond changes in their economic systems and greater
openness in their military activities. Changes have also begun to
occur in the field of human rights as was called for in the Final
Act. The rest of us would like to see the changes that are being
announced actually registered in the law and practice of our
Eastern partners, and in the documents under negotiation in the
Vienna follow-up to the Helsinki Conference.
   Much has been said about the human rights and humanitarian
provisions in the Final Act, and the failure of the Eastern bloc to
honor them. Yet, for all the bleak winds that have swept the plains
of justice since that signing day in 1975, the Accords have taken
root in the conscience of humanity, and grown in moral and,
increasingly, in diplomatic authority. I believe that this is no
accident. It reflects an increasing realization that the agenda of
East-West relations must be comprehensive, that security and human
rights must be advanced together, or cannot truly be secured at all.
   But it also shows that the provisions in the Final Act reflect
standards that are truly universal in their scope. The Accords
embody a fundamental truth, a truth that gathers strength with each
passing season, and that will not be denied; a truth, that like the
first Finnish settlers in America, all our ancient peoples find
themselves today in a new world, and that, as those early settlers
discovered, the greatest creative and moral force in this new
world, the greatest hope for survival and success, for peace and
happiness, is human freedom.
   Yes, freedom, the right to speak, to print, the right to
worship, to travel, to assemble, the belief, the right to be
different, the right as the American philospher Henry David Thoreau
wrote, ``to step to the music of a different drummer.'' This is
freedom as most Europeans and Americans understand it, and freedom
as it is embodied in the universal Declaration of Human Rights,
and, yes, in the Helsinki Accords.
   And far more than the locomotive or the automobile, the airplane
or the rocket, more than radio, television, or the computer, this
concept of liberty is the most distinct, peculiar, and powerful
invention of the civilization we all share. Indeed, without this
freedom there would have been no mechanical inventions, for
inventions are eccentricities, the men and women who create them
are visionaries, just like artists and writers, they see what
others fail to see and trust their insights when others don't.
   The same freedom that permits literature and the arts to
flourish, the same freedom that allows one to attend church,
synagogue, or mosque without apprehension, that same freedom from
oppression and supervision is the freedom that has given us, the
peoples of Western Europe and North America, our dynamism, our
economic growth, and out inventiveness. Together with Japan and
Australia and many others, we have lived in this state of freedom,
this house of democracy, since the end of the Second World War. A
house of democracy is a house whose doors are open to all. Because
of it, because of the liberty and popular rule we've shared, today
we also share a prosperity more widely distributed and extensive, a
political order more tolerant and humane than has ever before been
known on earth.
   To see not simply the immediate, but the historic importance of
this, we should remember how far many of our nations have travelled
and how desolate the future of freedom and democracy once seemed.
   Much of this century, the totalitarian temptation in one form or
another has beckoned to mankind, also promising freedom, but of a
different kind than the one that we celebrate today. This concept
of liberty is, as the Czechoslovak writer Milan Kundera has put it,
``The age-old dream of a world where everybody would live in
harmony, united by a single common will and faith, without secrets
from one another, the freedom of imposed perfection.''
   Fifty, forty, even as recently as thirty years ago, the contest
between this utopian concept of freedom on one hand and the
democratic concept of freedom on the other seemed a close one.
   Promises of a perfect world lured many Western thinkers and
millions of others besides. And many believed in the confident
prediction of history's inevitable triump. Well, few do today. Just
as democratic freedom has proven itself incredibly fertile, fertile
not merely in a material sense, but also in the abundance it has
brought forth in the human spirit. So too, Utopianism has proven
brutal and barren.
   Albert Camus once predicted that, in his words, ``When
revolution in the name of power and of history becomes a murderous
and immoderate mechanism, a new rebellion is consecrated in the
name of moderation of life.'' Isn't this exactly what we see
happening across the mountains and plains of Europe, and even
beyond the Urals today?
   In Western Europe, support for Utopian ideologies, including
support among intellectuals, has all but collapsed. While in the
non-democratic countries, leaders grapple with the internal
contradictions of their system. And some ask how they can make that
system better and more productive. In a sense, the front line in
the competition of ideas that has played in Europe and America for
more than 70 years has shifted East. Once, it was the democracies
that doubted their own view of freedom and wondered whether utopian
systems might not be better. Today, the doubt is on the other side.
   In just two days, I will meet in Moscow with General Secretary
Gorbachev. It'll be our fourth set of face-to-face talks since
1985. The General Secretary and I have developed a broad agenda for
US-Soviet relations, an agenda that is linked directly to the
agenda of the Final Act. Yes, as does the Final Act, we will
discuss security issues, we will pursue progress in arms reduction
and negotiations across the board, and continue our exchanges on
regional issues.

   Seven tugboats this morning began
hauling a drilling platform to its home off the Louisiana coast
where, when erected, it will stand higher than the world's tallest
building.
   ``It looks smaller and smaller the farther away it gets,'' Pete
Arnold, installation superintendent for the unwieldy engineering
marvel, said as the launch got under way. ``My job's just
beginning.''
   The world's tallest offshore drilling platform, dubbed
Bullwinkle, weighs 50,000 tons and is 1,365 feet long.
   After its two drilling rigs are installed in the Gulf of Mexico,
it will weigh 78,000 tons and stand 1,615 feet high _ 161 feet
higher than the world's tallest building, Chicago's Sears Tower.
   ``It is kind of a letdown when you finally see it go out,''
Gordon Sterling, project manager for Shell Offshore Inc., said
Thursday while overseeing last-minute preparations.
   Sterling has been in charge of Bullwinkle during the three years
it has taken to build the platform.
   Shell estimates the total cost of the Bullwinkle project at $500
million. Half of that is for building and installing the platform
and preparing it for drilling, while the remainder will go toward
development drilling, permanent production facilities and a
pipeline to move the oil to shore, the company said.
   A steady stream of area residents stopped by the yard Thursday
night to take a final look at the huge drilling jacket, which
towers above the platform's 4{-acre base and is visible several
miles away in Corpus Christi. The jacket will hold the drilling
rigs.
   ``I came out to see it one last time,'' said Keith Waddle of
Corpus Christi, as Bullwinkle loomed in front of him.
   Workers expect to take about three days to pull the structure
about 380 miles to its destination, some 150 miles southwest of New
Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico. Installation will be completed in
about three months.
   Twenty-eight pilings for Bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into
the sea floor and secured with concrete. Bullwinkle is designed to
withstand at least a 72-foot hurricane wave, with the ability to
sway at least six feet without stress damage.
   Shell estimates that production will begin in the first quarter
of 1989, and will peak at 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 1991 and
90 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in 1992. It has an
estimated life span of 35 years, according to the company.
   The Bullwinkle project was conceived when oil fetched well above
$20 a barrel, Sterling said. But, he added, ``even today at $15
it's an economic (profitable) venture.''

<HEAD>HELSINKI: regional issues.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Yes, we will also discuss economic issues, although, as in the
Helsinki process, we have seen in recent years how much the
differences in our systems inhibit expanded ties and how difficult
it is to divorce economic relations from human rights and other
elements of that relationship.
   And, yes, as our countries did at Helsinki, we will take up
other bilateral areas as well, including scientific, cultural, and
people-to-people exchanges, where we've been hard at work
identifying new ways to cooperate. In this area in particular, I
believe we'll see some good results before the week is over.
   And like the Final Act, our agenda now includes human rights as
an integral component. We have developed our dialogue and put in
place new mechanisms for discussion.
   The General Secretary has spoken and forthrightly on the
problems confronting the Soviet Union. In his campaign to address
these shortcomings, he talks of glasnost and perestroika, openness
and restructuring, words that to our ears have a particularly
welcome sound. And since he began his campaign, things have
happened that all of us applaud. The list includes the release from
labor camps or exile of people like Andrei Sakharov, Irina
Ratushnaskaya, Anatoly Koryagin, Iosef Begun, and many other
prisoners of conscience; the publication of books like ``Dr.
Zhivago'' and ``Children of the Arbat''; the distribution of movies
like ``Repentance'' that are critical of aspects of the Soviet past
and present; allowing higher levels of emigration; greater
toleration of dissent; General Secretary Gorbachev's recent
statements on religious toleration; the beginning of Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   All this is new and good. But at the same time, there is another
list, defined not by us, but by the standards of the Helsinki Final
Act and the sovereign choice of all participants, including the
Soviet Union, to subscribe to it. We need look no further through
the Final Act to see where Soviet practice does not, or does not
yet, measure up to Soviet commitment.
   Thirteen years after the Final Act was signed, it's difficult to
understand why cases of divided families and blocked marriages
should remain on the East-West agenda, or why Soviet citizens who
wish to exercise their right to emigrate should be subject to
artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings.
   And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those
who wish to practice their religious beliefs? Over 300 men and
women whom the world sees as political prisoners have been
released. There remains no reason why the Soviet Union cannot
release all people still in jail for expression of political or
religious belief, or for organizing to monitor the Helsinki Act.
   The Soviets talk about a common European home, and define it
largely in terms of geography. But what is it that cements the
structure of clear purpose, that all our nations pledge themselves
to build by their signature of the Final Act? What is it but the
belief in alienable rights and dignity of every single human being?
What is it but a commitment to true pluralist democracy? What is it
but a dedication to the universally understood democratic concept
of liberty that evolved from the genius of European civilization?
This body of values, this is what marks, or should mark, the common
European home.
   Mr. Gorbachev has spoken of, in his words, ``the artificiality
and temporariness of the block-to-block confrontation and the
archaic nature of the Iron Curtain.'' Well, I join him in this
belief, and welcome every sign that the Soviets and their allies
are ready not only to embrace, but to put into practice, the values
that unify and indeed define contemporary Western European
civilization and its grateful American offspring.
   Some 30 years ago, another period of relative openness, the
Italian socialist Pietro Nenni, long a friend of the Soviet Union,
warned that it was wrong to think that the relaxation could be
permanent in, as he said, ``the absence of any system of judicial
guarantees.'' And he added that only democracy and liberty could
prevent reversal of the progress under way.
   There are a number of steps which, if taken, would help ensure
the deepening and institutionalization of promise and reforms.
First, the Soviet leaders could agree to tear down the Berlin Wall
and all barriers between Eastern and Western Europe. They could
join us in making Berlin itself an all-European center of
communications, meetings and travel. They could also give legal and
practical protection to free expression and worship.
   Let me interject here that at one time Moscow was known as the
city of the ``forty-forties,'' because there were 1,600 belfries in
the churches of the city. The world welcomed the return of some
churches to worship after many years, but there are still
relatively few functioning churches, and almost no bells.
   Mr. Gorbachev recently said, as he put it, ``believers are
Soviet people, workers, patriots, and they have the full right to
express their conviction with dignity.'' While I applaud Mr.
Gorbachev's statement, but a magnificent demonstration of good will
it would be for the Soviet leadership for church bells to ring out
again, not only in Moscow, but throughout the Soviet Union.
   But beyond these particular steps there is a deeper question:
How can the countries of the East not only grant but guarantee the
protection of rights? The thought and practice of centuries has
pointed out the way, as the French constitutional philosopher
Montesquieu wrote more than two hundred years ago, ``There is no
liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the other
powers of government.'' And, like the independence of the
judiciary, popular control over those who make the laws provides a
vital, practical guarantee of human rights. So does the secret
ballot. So the freedom of citizens to associate and act for
political purposes or for free collective bargaining.
   I know that for the Eastern countries such steps are difficult,
and some may say it's unrealistic to call for them. Some said in
1975 that the standards set forth in the Final Act were
unrealistic, that the comprehensive agenda it embodied was
unrealistic. Some said earlier in this decade that calling for
global elimination of an entire class of US and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles was unrealistic, but calling
for 50 percent reductions in US and Soviet strategic offensive arms
was unrealistic, that the Soviets would never withdraw from
Afghanistan.
   Well, is it realistic to pretend that rights are truly protected
when there are no effective safeguards against arbitrary rule? Is
it realistic when the Soviet leadership itself is calling for
glasnost and democratization to say that judicial guarantees, or
the independence of the judiciary, or popular control over those
who draft the laws, or freedom to associate for political purposes
are unrealistic?
   And finally, is it realisitic to say that peace is truly secure
when political systems are less than open?

   We believe that realism is on our side when we say that peace
and freedom can only be achieved together, but that they can indeed
be achieved together if we're prepared to drive toward that goal.
   So did the leaders who met in this room to sign the Final Act.
They were visionaries of the most practical kind.
   In shaping our policy toward the Soviet Union, in preparing for
my meetings with the General Secretary, I have taken their vision,
a shared vision subscribed to by East, West, and the proud neutral
and non-aligned countries of this continent, as my guide. I believe
the standard that the framers of the Final Act set, including the
concept of liberty it embodies, is a standard for all of us. We can
do no less than uphold it and try to see it turned, as the Soviets
say, into life itself.
   We, in the West, will remain firm in our values, strong and
vigilent in defense of our interests, ready to negotiate honestly
for results of mutual and universal benefit. One lesson we drew
again from the events leading up to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty was that in the world as it is today, peace truly
does depend on Western strength and resolve. It is a lesson we will
continue to heed. But we're also prepared to work with the Soviets
and their allies whenever they're ready to work with us.
   By strength we do not mean a diktat _ that is an imposed
settlement.
   We mean confident negotiation.
   The road ahead may be long, but not as long as our countries had
before them 44 years ago when Finland's great president J.K.
Paasikivi told a nation that had shown the world uncommon courage
in a harrowing time, ``A path rises up from the slope from the
floor of the valley. At times the ascent is gradual, at other times
it's steeper. But all the time one comes closer and closer to free
open spaces above which God's ever brighter sky can be seen. The
way up will be difficult, but every step will take us closer to
open vistas.''
   I believe that in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev and I can take another
step toward a brighter future and a safer world. And I believe that
for the sake of all our ancient peoples, this new world must be a
place both of democratic freedom and of peace. It must be a world
in which the spirit of the Helsinki Final Act guides all our
countries, like a great beacon of hope to all mankind for ages to
come.
   Thank you, and God bless you, and bear with me now: Hyvaa
menestysta Svomen kansalle (Good luck to the Finnish nation.)

   Rep. John Duncan, the ranking Republican

not seek a 13th term in Congress because he is suffering from
cancer.
   ``My heart says yes, but my doctors say no,'' the 69-year-old
congressman said in a statement.
   Duncan, the former mayor of Knoxville, was first elected to
Congress from Tennessee's 2nd District in 1964. He said he learned
he had prostate cancer in 1980.
   There had been speculation that Duncan's son Jimmy, a Knox
County Criminal Court judge, would run for the seat. The younger
Duncan's office said this morning that he would discuss his plans
later today.

   Israeli soldiers fired tear gas grenades at
Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip today, and a 3-year-old
girl who inhaled the gas died, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   The army command confirmed the child's death but said the cause
could not exactly be determined.
   Also today, two Palestinian teen-agers shot by Israeli soldiers
during clashes in the occupied West Bank died, hospital officials
and Israel radio said.
   The deaths bring to 198 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Arab uprising in the occupied territories began last Dec. 8.
Two Israelis also have died.
   In Gaza City, hundreds o Moslem worshipers waving outlawed
Palestinian flags and black flags of mourning marched from a mosque
to the home of Ahmad Wazir, the cousin of the slain PLO military
chief Khalil Wazir, an Arab reporter said.
   The PLO leader, better known as Abu Jihad, was assassinated last
month in Tunis, reportedly by Israeli commandos. Israeli soldiers
blocked Palestinians from attending a ceremony at the cousin's home
Wednesday.
   Israel radio reported demonstrations in the Jabaliya refugee
camp and the towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah in Gaza.
   On Thursday, an Arab assailant stabbed a Jewish teen-ager in the
back as he walked through the Moslem quarter of Jerusalem's Old
City.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek called the attack on the seminary student an
isolated incident, but he said the nearly 6-month-long Palestinian
uprising has raised tensions between the city's Arabs and Jews.
   In the Old City, thousands of Moslem worshipers dispersed
peacefully after Sabbath prayers today.
   Officials at Gaza City's Ahli Arab hospital said relatives
brought Dina Sawafiri, claiming she died of tear gas fired by
Israeli troops in the Zaytoona neighborhood. Hospital officials
said the girl's 24-year-old aunt, Sabbah Sawafiri, also was treated
for tear gas effects.
   A relative who spoke on condition of anonymity said a tear gas
grenade landed in front of the family's house.
   A doctor at the hospital said the causes of Dina's death could
not be determined because the family took the girl's body and
buried it. The army command confirmed the report.
   A 14-year-old youth died at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital of a
wound to his head suffered Wednesday during a protest in the West
Bank refugee camp of Jalazone, Israel radio and Arab reports said.
   The radio said the boy apparently was shot accidentally when he
peeked out of his house. Arab reports identified him as Amin Rajab
Abu Radaha.
   Iyad Ibrahim Zaid, 16, died at east Jerusalem's Makassed
Hospital of bullet wounds to his chest and back. He was wounded
early in February during a demonstration in the West Bank town of
Qalqiliya, hospital officials said.
   Chanoch Albeck, 16, suffered a punctured lung when he was
attacked Thursday as he walked through the city's perfume market.
Police said the assailant shouted ``God is great'' before plunging
a kitchen knife into Albeck's back.
   Albeck was in stable condition today. Police rounded up 27
suspects.
   It was the second attack on a Jewish civilian in Jerusalem since
Dec. 8.
   On Dec. 28, a resident of Kiryat Arba was slightly wounded when
he was stabbed in the Old City.
   Hours after Thursday's stabbing, a firebomb was hurled at a
paramilitary border police patrol in Arab east Jerusalem's A-Tur
neighborhood, Israel radio said. There were no injuries or damage.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said police strength in Jerusalem
would remain at 1,200 because ``it's impossible to have police on
every corner ... We are assuring everyone that the city is safe.
This could have happened anywhere.''
   Israel seized the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan and
the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel
annexed east Jerusalem but maintains military governments in the
territories.
   Kollek called the stabbing an isolated incident.
   ``This is a very sad case, but for the last six months, not one
Jew or Arab has been killed in the city,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   The mayor said the uprising has strained relations between
Jerusalem's 340,000 Jews and 130,000 Arabs.
   ``We are living in an atmosphere of tension,'' Kollek said.

   Two police officers who accepted a $183,000
Bentley convertible from heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson _
then were forced to return it when their bosses found out _ have
been suspended for 10 days.
   Port Authority Officers Dana Bratton, 34, and Steven Barnes, 37,
were suspended without pay Thursday after a departmental hearing.
   The pair were in their squad car May 8 when they saw a
fender-bender involving Tyson's silver Bentley Convertible near the
entrance to the Holland Tunnel.
   ``I've had nothing but bad luck and accidents with this car. You
guys take this car and keep it,'' the New York Post quoted Tyson as
telling the officers.
   The two took the car to a garage in Jersey City, N.J., where it
stayed until Monday when rumors reached a police commander,
authorities said. The car was returned.
   The officers pleaded guilty to accepting a gratuity, conduct
unbecoming an officer, being off their posts and failure to file a
report, according to Lynn Tierney, a PA spokesman.

<HEAD>Income Tax Credit Proposed To Improve Voter Turnout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Idaho income tax credit is being proposed
to spur more people to go to the polls in the wake of the worst
voter turnout for any statewide election.
   ``I think it's in the best interest of government,'' said Ada
County Clerk John Bastida, who came up with the idea for a $5 voter
tax credit.
   Unofficial turnout in Tuesday's primary was less than 25 percent
of Idaho's 520,000 registered voters. Initial checks showed turnout
running about 22 percent in the larger counties and 15 percent in
Ada, the state's largest.
   ``When 15 percent of the people are dictating to the other 85
percent who their leaders are going to be, I think that's bad,''
Bastida said. ``There ought to be something gained from the people
going to the polls instead of saying, `I don't care. They're all
crooks anyway.'''
   He said voters could be given a stamp when they cast their
ballots and then place it on their state tax returns to show they
qualified for the break.
   ``I think the Legislature ought to turn around and take a look
at it,'' Bastida said.

<TEXT>
   The mother of a 9-year-old girl who
lost her lower legs to frostbite last winter after being locked in
an unheated apartment was sentenced today to 14 years in prison for
felony child neglect.
   Lake County Superior Court Judge Richard W. Maroc also said he
will recommend treatment for Darlwin J. Britt's cocaine habit while
the 29-year-old woman is in prison.
   The sentence had been specified in the plea bargain that spared
the daughter, Darlwin Carlisle, from testifying against her mother
and dropped two charges against the woman, but Maroc had the option
of a shorter prison term.
   The offense carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
   Construction workers boarding up an abandoned Gary house Jan. 17
discovered the child alone an unheated apartment. Investigators
said the girl had been in the apartment nearly 10 days during a
spell of near-zero temperatures.
   Surgeons later amputated her gangrenous legs below the knee.
   On May 6, Britt pleaded guilty to felony neglect, but defense
attorney Daniel Toomey said today he wanted to take the case to
trial. He did not explain his reasons.
   However, Maroc told Britt: ``I think you are locked into the
plea. I think it's a good plea, a valid one under the law.'' Toomey
asked the woman if she still accepted the plea, and she said, ``I
don't want to go to trial.''
   Child welfare authorities placed Darlwin with her paternal
grandmother after her release from the hospital. She has been
fitted with artificial legs.
   ``She still holds affection for her mother even though she
doesn't want to live with her,'' said Lake County Prosecutor Jack
F. Crawford.

<TEXT>
   The rebel delegation to peace talks
today accused the Sandinista government of breaking a promise to
allow them to meet with domestic opposition groups in the capital.
   ``We came to Managua because the Sandinista government had
offered us free movement and that we would meet with the opposition
parties, but that didn't occur last night,'' said Bosco Matamoros,
spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   He said the rebel leaders had planned to meet Thursday night
with the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, which groups political
parties and other groups that oppose the Sandinistas.
   ``The Sandinista government told us that they would come here,
and they told them that we would go there,'' Matamoros said. ``So,
they were waiting for us there and we for them here, and there
wasn't a meeting. We're going to see if they (the Sandinistas)
fulfill that promise today.''
   Despite the shaky start to the peace talks, the two sides
resumed talking this morning for the third round of top-level
discussions in Managua to seek an end to the 6{-year war. This
round began on Thursday.
   The Sandinistas on Thursday rejected the Contras' offer to
disarm if Nicaragua embraces democracy.
   The Contras, as the rebels are known, demanded that the
government guarantee complete press freedom within five days and
abolish the military draft within 60.
   They also demanded that the Sandinistas ease their control over
the army and government and allow the rebels to resupply their
forces in the field.
   Manuel Espinoza, the presidential spokesman, on Thursday
described the plan as ``preposterous.''
   ``The Contra proposal is unrealistic and casts aside all that
has been done and agreed upon until now and makes new proposals,''
Espinoza said.
   ``With this proposal, they're acting as if they had won the war
and the Sandinistas had surrendered,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco.
   Tinoco said the government offered to discuss ``guarantees in
the electoral process, dates for municipal elections, reforms in
the electoral law, pluralistic representation in the electoral
council and guarantees and norms for the functioning of a mixed
economy.''
   Alfredo Cesar, chief of the rebel delegation, said the Contra
offer contained ``democratic changes the country should make at the
end of the war.''
   Cesar said the rebels were prepared to make a ``special effort
to achieve a definitive cease-fire.'' But he said the Contra
delegates were not optimistic about the outcome of the meeting and
said the government has not complied with a preliminary peace plan
agreed upon March 23 in Sapoa.
   At Sapoa, a Nicaraguan town near the border with Costa Rica, the
two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire and on the basis for
further talks to arrange a permanent truce.
   The cease-fire expires May 30, but President Daniel Ortega said
this week he would extend it for an additional 30 days.
   Rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not
break Ortega's unilateral extension of the cease-fire.
   Under what the rebels called a flexible timetable, they
indicated they would lay down their arms sometime before Christmas.
   ``It seems they are trying to bypass the Sapoa agreement,'' said
Bayardo Arce, vice coordinator of the political commitee of the
governing Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   In an interview, Arce said that Defense Minister Gen. Humberto
Ortega, head of the Nicaraguan delegation, told the Contra
delegates ``that the logical thing was to continue the discussions
under the Sapoa agreement.''
   The delegations are meeting under tight security at the Camino
Real Hotel. Contra representatives were permitted Thursday to leave
the hotel to visit relatives and political leaders.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Joao Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
attended as witnesses.

<TEXT>
   A Navy officer and the Marine enlisted man
she married show that ``an officer and a gentleman can be a
couple,'' their attorney said after a general dismissed
fraternization charges.
   Lt. Kathleen A. Mazure, 29, was cleared after a 4{-hour hearing
Tuesday before Maj. Gen. Gene Deegan, commander of the Marine Air
Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms.
   ``The case ... was about whether the love of country by a member
of the military could somehow automatically and in all
circumstances preclude the love of another, also a member of the
military,'' said Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California.
   Ms. Mazure and her husband, Scott Price, 24, who resigned from
the Marines, showed that ``an officer and a gentleman could be a
couple and that there was something sick and cockeyed about
declaring for all members of the military _ even for members of
different branches _ that love at first sight or anytime thereafter
was always to be a crime,'' Rosenbaum said Thursday.
   Price, of Eden, Texas, married Ms. Mazure on Nov. 28.
   Charges were brought Nov. 25, marking ``the first time in the
history of the United States ... that charges of fraternization
have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of
another branch of the service,'' Rosenbaum said, emphasizing that
the couple were not in the same chain of command.
   The charges had been recommended for court-martial. But on
Tuesday, Deegan held a hearing that resulted in dismissal of the
allegation, the attorney said.
   ``I love my husband. I love the Navy, and I don't see why the
two are not compatible,'' said Ms. Mazure, a dentist assigned to
Twentynine Palms. ``I hope that from out of this the fraternization
policy will become more defined.''
   Ms. Mazure said that she was stationed in Jacksonville, Fla.,

   A judge has decided a 67-year-old man
paralyzed in the crossfire of a crack cocaine shoot-out can't
testify in the case because his appearance could prejudice the jury.
   ``His speech therapist ... says he wants to testify, and I've
been over and talked to him, and he indicated to me he wants to
testify. I can't believe we can't put the victim on the stand,''
said Deputy District Attorney Michael Gaffey.
   Alameda County Superior Court Judge David Lee ruled Wednesday
after a hearing at the hospital bedside of Terry Brown, who is
paralyzed from the neck down and breathes with the help of a
respirator.
   Brown's appearance could jeopardize the defendants' right to a
fair trial, Lee said.
   ``The man was an innocent victim who stepped out of his house
and was shot _ he doesn't remember anything,'' said Ray Plumhoff,
an assistant public defender in the assault trial of Nate Porter,
20, and Johnny Lee Smith, 19.
   Porter and Smith are charged with assault in the June 30, 1987,
gunfight in which at least five men battled in the street outside
Brown's home.
   ``The only reason (te prosecutor) wanted to bring Mr. Brown in
was to prejudice the jury by showing how badly injured he was.''
   Brown was shot in the neck with an Uzi carbine as Porter's gang
shot it out with a rival gang led by Art Coleman, 21, who is
believed to have fired the shot that struck Brown, the prosecutor
said.
   Coleman was killed by three men who broke into his bedroom in
August 1987.
   Porter and Smith have been charged with the attack on Brown,
under the ``vicarious liability'' legal theory that says all
participants of a crime are equally responsible.

   George Bush, claiming the bracing
Maine air had invigorated him to step up his battle against
Democrat Michael Dukakis, declared today, ``I'm the underdog and I
like it.''
   ``He is the front-runner. He's been decreed that by poll after
poll,'' Bush told reporters in a news conference on the lawn of his
oceanside retreat.
   ``Do I worry about it? I don't worry about it. I like fighting
back,'' Bush said, brushing off recent polls suggesting Dukakis'
lead has been widening.
   He called for a resumption of collpased negotiations to remove
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega from power, though he had previously
expressed reservations about the talks. He said the talks should
also include other nations if possible.
   Bush branded as ``an outrageous lie'' what he said was a
reported suggestion by Noriega that the negotiations were meant to
help Bush's campaign.
   ``When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related,
indicted dictator, discount them. They are total lies,'' he said.
   Bush, with the pounding surf of the Atlantic to his back, also
said if elected he would personnally countermand any effort by the
Secret Service to close off the nearby waters to lobstermen as a
security precaution.
   ``That is absolutely absurd,'' he said. ``They will continue to
fish here and they will continue to be welcome.''
   As a sole lobster boat worked its pots in a cove several hundred
yards away, Bush said he would give up coming to his Maine retreat
rather than see the waters closed.
   Bush is here for a week of talks with advisers and prominent
Republicans. Among today's visitors were Govs. John McKernan of
Maine, John Sununu of New Hampshire and James Thompson of Illinois
as well as former Housing Secretary Carla Hills and former deputy
Treasury Secretary Richard Darman.
   Of the recent polls, Bush said, ``things aren't in focus yet. It
is May. The election is in November.''
   A Washington Post-ABC poll today reported that Dukakis had a
13-point lead over Bush _ and that among female voters, the
Massachusetts governor was ahead by a 60-30 margin.
   Bush conceded that the ``gender gap'' was a major concern. He
said it was at the top of today's discussion list, in fact.
   ``What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on
certain women's issues. One of them will be day care.''
   Bush promised to come out of his one-week break swinging.
   ``When I get up here I feel _ it's not feistiness _ but I feel
very relaxed about it. I don't feel troubled by somebody pointing
out I'm behind in the polls. ... I'm coming out of 10 points down
in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.''
   ``There's a little bit of a cholesterol rise, the frustration
level going up, in terms of sitting around and listening to (Jesse)
Jackson and Michael Dukakis dump all over me and the the
administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more combative,''
Bush said.
   One day earlier, Bush pollster Robert Teeter conceded that
Bush's ``gender gap'' seemed to be far worse than that ever faced
by President Reagan, who also had more support among men than women
voters.
   ``It's largely for institutional reasons. It's got more to do
with party than it does with candidates. But it did close in 1984
as we got close to the election, although it never closed
completely. There is an institutional and a party gender gap and
we're going to make a very strong effort to close it,'' Teeter said.
   Bush staff chief Craig Fuller said that the vice president would
focus on domestic affairs in sessions on Friday and Saturday and
would meet with economic advisers next Tuesday and Wednesday to
flesh out his fall campaign positions.
   Fuller said that Bush was not overly concerned about recent
polls that showed him falling behind Dukakis.
   ``There are some advantages to being the underdog and fighting
back,'' Fuller said.
   Campaigning in New Jersey on Thursday, Bush focused on the war
against drugs, calling for a requirement that government contracts
be awarded only to companies that have ``drug free'' programs for
their employes.
   Aides said that the proposal could involve some form of
mandatory drug testing for all companies doing busines with the
government, although details had not been worked out.
   Bush also called for an international drug ``strike force'' that
would seek out and destroy drug crops wherever they were found.
   And he said he would put ``a single military figure'' in charge
of coordinating U.S. participation in such an effort. Bush has said
that the overall anti-drug effort in his administration would be
headed by the vice president.

   Republican George Bush said today he is unperturbed by polls
that give likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis a double-digit
lead, adding that ``I like fighting back.'' The Massachusetts
governor, for his part, scoffed at Bush's drug proposals and asked
``Why haven't these been done in the past seven years?''
   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson made quick stops in New Mexico, one of
four states that will hold end-of-the-season primaries on June 7,
while Bush settled in for a week of strategy sessions at his summer
home in Maine.
   ``I don't feel troubled out by somebody pointing out I'm behind
in the polls,'' Bush told reporters. ``I'm coming out 10 points
down in these polls and I've got five months to fight back.''
   ``I like that position,'' he added, noting that he lost Iowa's
first-in-the-nation's caucuses in February but came back to clinch
the Republican nomination handily.
   Jackson, meanwhile, was wrapping up a 10-day stay in the West
today. Jackson has been campaigning hard in California, but polls
suggest he is running well behind Dukakis in the state, with its
big primary only 11 days away.
   There are 314 delegates are at stake in the California contest,
and primaries the same day in New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico
offer another 162 delegates. Dukakis hopes to clinch the Democratic
nomination in that round of races.
   Jackson, who has been focusing less on his slim chance of
winning the nomination and more on his efforts to influence the
Democratic platform, claimed credit on Thursday for bringing the
front-running Dukakis closer to his point of view on some issues.
   ``He is adjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson told a rally in San
Jose, Calif. Dukakis aides, though, say the governor is listening
to what Jackson has to say but not making any major changes in his
positions.
   ``We're not going to negotiate our basic stands,'' Dukakis
spokesman Leslie Dach said Thursday. ``You're not going to see any
kind of fundamental shifts.''
   Dukakis himself rarely makes mention of Jackson these days. He
reserves his disdain almost exclusively for the Reagan
administration, particularly Bush, who already has enough delegates
for the GOP nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor was campaigning in Palo Alto, Calif.,
on Thursday, hours after Bush called for the creation of an
international anti-drug strike force, a drug summit, and the denial
of government contracts to companies lacking anti-drug programs.
   The vice president's proposals, described by aides as a major
anti-drug initiative, came in a speech before he visited a
drug-rehabilitation center in Newark, N.J.
   Dukakis said that he wasn't impressed with the recommendations.
   ``The question is, why haven't these been done in the past seven
years? Isn't the vice president in charge of this effort?'' he
asked, referring to Bush's position as head of an anti-drug task
force.
   Bush arrived Thursday night at his vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he intends to spend a week conferring
with aides and Republican leaders. One topic certain to be
discussed is a string of recent polls indicating Bush is running
behind Dukakis.
   The latest such survey, by ABC News and The Washington Post,
gave Dukakis a 13-point advantage. According to the poll published
in today's editions of the Post, Dukakis leads Bush 53 percent to
40 percent.
   The survey also suggested that Bush is viewed unfavorably by
nearly four times as many people as Dukakis is _ by 37 percent,
compared with 10 percent in Dukakis' case.
   The Post-ABC survey also said that when voters were asked about
problems facing the country, Bush scored better on national
defense, but he trailed Dukakis on a dozen other issues, including
the fight against drugs.
   The survey, based on telephone interviews with 1,172 adults
between May 19 to May 26, had a margin of error of plus orminus 3
percentage points, the newspaper said.
   The vice president's pollster, Robert Teeter, said Thursday that
the Bush campaign was concerned about the recent polls, but said
findings in May don't necessarily point to trouble in November.
   ``You'd rather be ahead. But there surely is no feeling of
crisis or panic,'' Teeter said. ``We're a long way ahead of the
election.''
   Meanwhile, both Democrats continued to hammer away at what is
becoming a familiar campaign theme _ the administration's dealings
with Panama's military leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Jackson pointed to the ``disgraceful practice of negotiating
with drug dealers, which discredits our government and is beneath
our dignity.''
   And Dukakis said, ``I'm going to continue to insist on a full
explanation from the administration about what's going on'' with
Noriega.
   ``Are there links with the CIA? Who were the people that were
involved in drug-running and profit-skimming? And who was it in
this administration who thought that made sense?'' he asked.
   The Reagan administration has been trying for months to induce
Noriega to relinquish his post. The general is under U.S.
indictment on drug-trafficking charges, which the administration
had offered to drop to get him out of power.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was facing a problem at home that
Republicans hope will prove an embarrassment _ a $110 million tax
increase that is headed for his desk. Dukakis makes frequent
reference when campaigning to his reputation as a tax-cutting
governor.
   The tax package includes $70 million to tie the state income tax
to the federal code and $40 million from a cigarette tax, and is
aimed at helping alleviate budget problems. However, the governor
has insisted that the state budget can be balanced without the tax
proposal.

<TEXT>
   In five weeks, Iraq has dramatically
turned the tables on Iran with two major battlefield victories that
have aggravated Tehran's military and political troubles.
   The military defeats have badly jolted Iran, which was already
beset by economic woes, a political power struggle between radicals
and conservatives, and growing international isolation.
   ``There's a lot of confusion in Tehran now,'' said a Western
diplomatic source with contacts in the Iranian capital. ``But the
Iranians will not take this lying down. They'll retaliate.''
   ``They may be on the ropes, but they're not on their knees
yet,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The unexpectedly aggressive tactics of the Iraqis, who for the
last six years have been content to fight a static war behind their
formidable defense lines, appeared to catch the Iranians
flat-footed twice in just over a month.
   The Iraqi 3rd Army Corps, spearheaded by brigades of the elite
Presidential Guard, drove the Iranians out of marshlands east of
Iraq's southern port city of Basra on Wednesday. The 7th Corps,
again led by Presidential Guard units, recaptured the Faw peninsula
south of Basra in a 34-hour assault that ended April 18.
   For Iran, the loss of that territory was a major psychological
and political blow. Iraq took back the most significant gains Iran
had to show for 7{ years of war.
   Iraq also stole Iranian bargaining chips in any future peace
talks in the Persian Gulf war.
   Moreover, Tehran was suffering other military setbacks. The same
day the Faw battle ended, the U.S. Navy sank one of Iran's missile
frigates and a missile-attack craft and disabled another frigate
after destroying two of Iran's offshore oil platforms.
   The battles seriously damaged Iran's naval power. Tehran sought
to save face by staging big naval maneuvers.
   But Western sources said although Iran boasted that 55 vessels
took part in the maneuvers, only five modern warships and an aging
destroyer were assembled with small craft.
   ``They're clearly in no shape to take on the Americans again,
but the Revolutionary Guards in their armed speedboats remain a
menace,'' said a European naval specialist, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   However, it may well be too soon to consider these defeats a
turning point in the seemingly interminable gulf war.
   ``The Iraqis are clearly determined to reclaim their
territory,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, an analyst with the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. ``But
they don't seem to be interested in going across the border into
Iran again,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after weeks of border
skirmishes. The Iranians initially were overwhelmed but drove the
Iraqis back across the frontier by 1982.
   Afterward, the Iranians held the initiative in the ground war _
until last month.
   The sudden change in Iraqi strategy may stem from Baghdad's
frustration with the failure of the U. N. Security Council to
impose sanctions on Iran for not heeding a U.N. cease-fire
resolution passed in July.
   Iran has resisted international pressure to talk about peace,
despite its growing economic turmoil. Iraqi air raids on Iran's oil
industry, its economic lifeline, have taken their toll. Iran is now
importing unprecedented amounts of refined products, like kerosene
and jet fuel.
   Moreover, the slump in the value of the dollar, to which oil
prices are pegged, has cut revenues that Tehran needs to pay for
its war effort.
   Up to half of Tehran's 6 million people fled to the countryside
to escape Iraqi missiles that blasted a path of destruction across
the city from Feb. 29 to April 21.
   There are signs that Tehran's ability to wage war has been hurt.
The Iranians failed to launch an expected major offensive during
the winter, when bad weather favors Iran by neutralizing Iraq's
superior air power and armor.
   It was the first time in six years the Iranians failed to launch
a major winter push.

<HEAD>UN Relief Coordinator Sees War Delaying Refugee Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. official said Friday that continuing
warfare in Afghanistan could delay the return of more than 5
million war refugees.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the United Nations' relief
coordinator for Afghanistan, said he could not predict how many of
the refugees plan to return. Most are in Iran and Pakistan.
   ``It's common sense that people do not feel very encouraged to
go home if they know there is still fighting,'' Sadruddin told
reporters.
   But ``the one incentive which will encourage them to go home as
quickly as possible is that they love their country and feel very
homesick,'' he said.
   He said respecting last month's Geneva accords, which call for
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the safe and
voluntary return of refugees, was ``paramount'' for peace.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the Afghan
government fight a civil war with anti-communist guerrillas, and
they began pulling out of the country May 15. The guerrillas have
said they will continue fighting until the Afghan government falls.
   Sadruddin left Geneva on Friday for Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Iran, where he will talk with government leaders and refugee
experts on the relief and repatriation effort.
   It is his first trip to the region since U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar named him to oversee the refugee return.
   Perez de Cuellar will appeal in June for funds to launch the
program, said Sadruddin, a former U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   But ``if the conflict continues, it will be difficult to put the
structures into place,'' Sadruddin said. Land mines littering the
countryside after 10 years of civil war must be removed ``before
anyone can go back,'' he said.
   An internal U.N. document compiled last month predicted it would
cost about $130 million for 1 million refugees to return and $324
million for the return of 3 million refugees.
   About 2.4 million Afghans live in Iran, and another 3.1 million
live in Pakistan, according to U.N. figures.

   Fiji has agreed to supply 100 additional

   The additional troops will bring the number of Fijian forces

   A 10-year-old girl found two pieces of poisoned
chocolate on a roadside in southwestern Japan on Friday, the latest
in a series of poisoned candy incidents since September.
   Hideyoshi Bando, a spokesman for the Tokushima Prefectural
Police, said the child, who did not eat the candy, found it on her
way to school near the town of Itano. She reported it to a teacher,
who notified police.
   Bando said preliminary tests on the chocolate indicated the
presence of a highly poisonous acid.
   The incident was the second such case in two months in the
Tokushima region, 320 miles southwest of Tokyo. Three pieces of
poisoned chocolate were found April 3 in the grass near a religious
shrine in the area.
   Chocolates tainted with poison were first discovered in two
schools in neighboring Kagawa region on Sept. 8, 1987, and similar
incidents were reported the same month in at least three other
Tokushima schools.
   Police suspect the same person or group is responsible for the
string of incidents.

   The government will sell its

Friday.
   The black Tatra limousines, symbols of power and prestige in

   It did not say how many limousines would be put up for sale.
   Officials have ordered ministries and departments to reduce

   The government has already begun to put into place 30 percent
cuts that will affect 5,800 workers by the end of 1989, the

<TEXT>
   Movie buffs expecting to see a classic
film about British military hero Adm. Horatio Nelson instead got a
soft-porn flick about Nelson's love affair with an aristocrat.
   A spokeswoman for the Watershed Media Center said a mislabeled
film container caused the mix-up Thursday night.
   The center planned to show ``Lady Hamilton,'' the 1941 film
starring Vivian Leigh and Laurence Olivier that tells the story of
Nelson and his love affair.
   Center spokeswoman Sara Davies said ``Emma Hamilton,'' the
pornographic movie about the same subject, was mistakenly put in
the film can.
   About half the audience of 20 walked out when shots of a
half-naked woman appeared on screen.
   ``The film can was labeled `Lady Hamilton,' and we believe it
was a catalog error by the National Film Archives,'' said Ms.
Davies. ``The projection staff soon realized something was wrong
and stopped the film.''
   ``Lady Hamilton,'' also called ``That Hamilton Woman,'' was a
U.S.-made film designed to increase pro-British sentiment during
World War II. It was reportedly Winston Churchill's favorite movie.
   Ms. Davies said irate patrons received their money back along
with a free ticket to another show. The center showed ``Streetcar
Named Desire'' that night.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Urge Members To Join In AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mormon Church members should join in legal
and political efforts to stop the spread of AIDS, but the best
defense is obedience to the doctrine of chastity before marriage
and fidelity after, the faith's First Presidency said Friday.
   In a two-page statement, the three-member presidency praised
efforts to find a medical solution to AIDS, but reiterated church
teaching on sexual relations:
   ``The Lord has not left mankind without clear guidance on
matters that affect our happiness. That guidance is chastity before
marriage, total fidelity in marriage, abstinence from all
homosexual relations, avoidance of illegal drugs and reverence and
care for the body.''
   The First Presidency governs the 6.5 million-member Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its members are President Ezra
Taft Benson and counselors Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson.
   The statement quoted from an earlier sermon in which Hinckley
urged people to disdain ``carnal attractions that often result in
the tragedies that follow moral transgression.''
   The statement urged compassion for victims of the deadly disease
and said members should work through legal and political channels
to help combat it.

   President Reagan, in his first visit to the Soviet
capital, will see an enormous city of 12-lane boulevards dominated
in part by seven massive Stalin-era Baroque buildings. He will see
the city at its best: the lilacs are blooming, the weather is mild
and downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes.
   Arriving for the first time in the Soviet capital is at times
like taking a trip back in time. The electrical appliances seem
old-fashioned and traffic jams are rare, though smog has taken hold.
   Nearly 9 million people live here, yet the only time it seems
crowded is when people are queuing to buy food, perfume, and other
scarce consumer goods. Humans are dwarfed by immense buildings,
both the charmless, modern structures from the 1960s _ said to be
modeled on buildings Nikita Khrushchev saw and liked in New York
City _ and a variety of monuments to mother Russia's war heroes.
   Few of the cars are new, almost all are Soviet-made, and
taxicabs seem scarce, at least to the legion of visitors who
arrived this week to prepare for the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.
   Most Muscovites do not own cars, and so while Central Committee
and Politburo members are whisked into the Kremlin during the
morning rush hour and out again at dusk, millions of commuters use
the city's excellent subway or local bus and trolley systems.
   The Kremlin is not one big building, like the Pentagon for
example. Instead, it is a walled citadel of government buildings,
cathedrals, towers and arsenals dating back to the 14th Century.
``Alcatraz on the outside, Versailles on the inside,'' in the words
of one American.
   Some of the city's best known sites _ the red-and-white and
yellow-and-blue onion domes of St. Basil's Cathedral, cobblestoned
Red Square and the Bolshoi Theater _ sit just outside the Kremlin`s
red-brick wall.
   The words ``grim,'' ``drab,'' ``dreary,' and ``unkempt'' are
often used to describe Moscow, but the sunny skies _ the first in
10 months _ the sweet-smelling purple lilacs and the pre-summit
spruce-up helps overcome the feeling of grayness brought on in
large part by decades of listless architecture.
   ``It's not Paris, but it's a lot prettier that it was two months
ago,'' said Richard Gilbert, an American Embassy spokesman.
   Soldiers, in their gray tunics and green hats, are shining the
huge swinging metal doors on government buildings.
   Women on hands and knees are planting begonias in front of the
Kremlin wall, workers are mowing the grass sprinkled with yellow
dandelions and plasterers are touching up the Union of Writers'
Club, where Reagan will visit. A three-man team is painting the
flagpoles of the Pushkin Museum.
   Residents seem excited about the upcoming Reagan visit.
   At the Hotel Rossiya, home to many of the American journalists
and officials working at the summit, the local employees _ not
widely known for wasting pleasantries _ are going out of their way
to be helpful.
   The dezhurni, Russian ``key ladies'' who are posted day and
night on each hotel floor _ smile when you turn in the key after
leaving the room. Service may be slow, but this week at least it is
service with a smile.
   ``Service is impossible here,'' said George Black, a businessman
from Basking Ridge, N.J., who has dealt with the Soviets in his
advertising business. ``There's no motivation, that's the
problem,'' he said.
   Black and his wife, Ruth, say they have deep affection for the
Soviet people. ``When you get to know them, they are very nice,''
he said. For Americans, the language barrier is a real problem, he
said, because the Soviets may seem rude when they are really just
embarrassed at not being able to communicate.
   While Soviet bureaucrats and law enforcement officials generally
wear a dour expression, young people were smiling as they strolled
in the May sunshine along the broad sidewalks of Kalinin Prospekt,
Moscow's ``Fifth Avenue,'' where behind the glass shop windows are
a paltry number of fashions and consumer products.
   Moscow has little street crime, no doubt partly a result of the
omnipresence of police. There are so many uniformed officers that
they sometimes seem to be watching one another.
   The Moscow militia says none of Moscow's 60 banks has been
robbed in 20 years.
   The hotels have plenty of food on hand for the summit,
attracting large numbers of Soviets who filled their bellies, and
in some cases their pockets, with such rarities as tomatoes,
sausages and cheese _ items that the locals say have not been seen
for weeks in most stores.
   The beriozkas, special hotel shops which accept only Western
currency, are freshly stocked for the summit, and foreign residents
of the city have been seen carting cases of wine to their waiting
cars _ a basic precaution in a society where such commodities may
not reappear for months.
   Renee Fisher, a teacher from Tampa, Fla., said her biggest
disappointment on her trip to the Soviet Union is that the
facilities are ``dirty and unhygienic.'' But that hardly affected
her trip, she said.
   ``The people are so nice and they love Americans,'' she said.

   A medical examiner under investigation
for supplementing his income selling bones from the dead for up to
$425 a body had the approval of his superiors, the county's chief
administrator says.
   ``Unless we are given some new information that it legally
should not continue, then it will,'' said Tom Vickers, head of the
Bexar County commission.
   County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Vincent DiMaio said Thursday
he earned about $50,000 since 1983 removing bones for the
non-profit Bone Bank Foundation of San Antonio, which used them in
transplants.
   Prosecutors are examining whether he violated the law in
removing the bones in county facilities or on county time, said
Assistant District Attorney Nelson ``Skip'' Atwell.
   ``We will talk to him and the county auditor and then we'll sit
down and evaluate the thing and see if it's a commissioner's court
issue, or something we should be involved in or something nobody
should be involved in,'' Atwell said.
   DiMaio, who was among several pathologists who exhumed Lee
Harvey Oswald's body in Dallas for reexamination in 1981, said he
has charged between $175 and $425 per body for removing bones from
corpses sent to the Medical Examiner's Office.
   A gunshot wound expert who also supplements his $92,000-a-year
salary by testifying at civil and criminal trials, DiMaio said that
he had county approval and that consent forms were obtained from
survivors.
   ``I charged for my time, on my own time, not on the county's
time,'' he said. ``They may be able to change their minds, but they
can't ever say they weren't informed.''
   Vickers said that the county commissioners in 1983 agreed to let
DiMaio do work for the Bone Bank Foundation and decided the county
would bill the foundation $25 per case for use of the facilities,
Vickers said.
   ``It was all above board,'' Vickers said. ``As far as I can
tell, he didn't try to hide anything. His statement was given in
open court, in front of attorneys and auditors.''
   DiMaio likened his role to a physician removing a heart from an
accident victim for use in another transplant. ``Everyone is paid
for their services,'' he said.
   At the foundation, the bones are cleaned and chopped into pieces
and freeze-dried for use in transplants, mostly for back, dental or
reconstructive surgery.

   Authorities seized 9.4 pounds of heroin and
arrested five men from Hong Kong in the second-largest heroin bust
in Japan, police said Friday.
   The heroin, with an estimated street value of $3 million, was
discovered in two suitcases when four of the men arrived at Tokyo's
Narita airport, a National Police Agency drug enforcement officer
said.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said four of
the men were arrested Sunday. A fifth man, believed to be the
leader of the group, arrived at the airport Monday and was arrested.
   All five had entered Japan several times since July and were
targeted by customs agents as possible drug smugglers, he said.
   Japan's largest heroin-smuggling case was broken in December
1985, when 10.1 pounds were confiscated, the officer said. Last
year, a total of 10.6 pounds of the drug was seized, he said.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson told Indian leaders today that Indians have been ignored by
the government and ``it's not too much to ask for a summit with the
American Indian leadership.''
   Jackson spoke to the Indian group at the All Indian Pueblo
Council today, one day after telling a separate audience that the
American public deserves a full-scale congressional investigation
of U.S. dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   The U.S. government should ``not negotiate with drug dealers,''
Jackson said Thursday.
   Vice President George Bush and President Reagan have been plea
bargaining with Noriega, Jackson said.
   ``We need and deserve a full-scale congressional
investigation,'' he said. ``So far, we've heard one side of the
story ... they've been trying to smoke him out, buy him out, the
deal being (Noriega's) silence.''
   He told the Indians today that they should not surrender their
values.
   Jackson hearkened back to the beginning of his Rainbow Coalition
and called for people to work together.
   ``Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos, ranchers on
ranches, Indians on reservations. ... There's a tendency of these
people to be abandoned by law,'' he said. ``The real challenge is
to begin to pull together our various backgrounds and find common
ground ... to turn to each other and not on each other.''
   On Thursday, Jackson spoke to the National Federation of
Democratic Women as the group opened its annual convention here,
and he lamented what he said were inequities women face in society.
   ``Half our nation is female. Half of our poor children live in a
house run by poor women where there is no man,'' he said. ``Women
make 65 cents on a dollar to what a man makes. ...
   ``Your self-respect is not negotiable,'' he said. ``You've
earned the right to expect ERA (the Equal Rights Amendment) to be
in the (Democratic Party) platform.''
   Dukakis was to speak to the women's group later today.
   Jackson also talked of the government's need to stop the flow of
drugs into the United States.
   ``Drugs affect our family. Drugs affect our children in schools.
Drugs affect the safety of our streets,'' he said. ``Drugs are the
No. 1 threat to our national security.''
   Jackson, in the final weeks of campaigning for his party's
nomination, made several campaign appearances in California earlier
in the day.
   The obviously tired and hoarse candidate also criticized a small
movement in the United States that wants to make English the
official language of the country in a reference to the upcoming
summit between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Reagan is going to meet with Gorbachev this week in Moscow,''
he said. ``It's the right thing to do. It's a step in the right
direction. ... I hope our translator does not speak English only.''
   Jackson's visit to New Mexico was the second this month.
   Polls indicate Jackson is running far behind Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for the June 7 primary.
   Dukakis has 1,700 delegates for the nomination, while Jackson
has 983 according to the Associated Press. Another 443 delegates
still are uncommitted, and a candidate needs at least 2,081 to win
the nomination.
   New Mexico will have 28 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta this summer.

   Academy Award winners Shirley MacLaine, Sally
Field and Olympia Dukakis will come to terms with life, death and
marriage in a small Southern town in the movie version of ``Steel
Magnolias.''
   The film, based on the acclaimed off-Broadway play about six
women in a small Louisiana town, also will star Dolly Parton and
Daryl Hannah, the movie's producer, Ray Stark, said. One of the six
major female roles is yet to be cast.
   Shooting is to begin July 12 in Natchitoches, La., and should be
completed by early September, said Stark.
   ``Herb Ross (who will direct) and I have put together what I
think is the most exciting ensemble cast since George Cukor did
`The Women''' in 1939, Stark said.
   That cast included Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Rosalind
Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Marjorie Main and Hedda
Hopper.
   ``Steel Magnolias''' focuses on life at a small-town beauty shop
owned by Ms. Parton's character.

   His new movie, ``Her Alibi,'' is to begin shooting June 27 in
Baltimore, though it's set in New York and Connecticut.
   Location crews won't reveal much about the Marty Elfand movie,

weeks of shooting, said Drew Friedman, international account

   Except for a few establishing shots in New York, much of the
movie will be filmed in Maryland, he said.
   ``If we just waited for every Baltimore script to come down the

Friedman.

   Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson are
officially married. They just can't prove it.
   Reynolds built a special chapel for the April 29 wedding, and
hired a special caterer and a motorized stagecoach. But he forgot
where he put the marriage license.
   ``He called us the day before the wedding and said he couldn't
seem to find it,'' said John Dunkle, Palm Beach County clerk of
courts. ``He wanted to know what to do.''
   Dunkle had delivered the license application to Reynolds at his
Jupiter ranch March 2.
   The application is good for 60 days. Burt and Loni were married
on the 57th day. All Reynolds had to do was get the minister and
two witnesses to sign the license after the ceremony.
   Someone in Dunkle's office later sent Reynolds a duplicate. One
of Reynolds' assistants, Elaine Hall, is mailing it around so the
witnesses can sign it.

   A visitor who regularly waddles into the garden at
No. 10 Downing St. won't leave without a swim and a drink in the
future if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has her way.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Friday she plans to build a pond for a duck
from a nearby park that has turned up at the back door of her
official residence and laid some eggs.
   Mrs. Thatcher, whose cat-in-residence died last week after 14
years as the No. 10 mouser, told patients at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire, northeast of London, of her plans.
   ``We are going to have a little bit of water put in, because we
have a duck that comes across from St. James's Park and lays her
eggs,'' said the prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the visitor never met up with Wilberforce,
the cat who served four prime ministers after straying into Downing
Street in 1973. Wilberforce, who retired to the countryside a year
ago, died at the age of 15.
   A Downing Street spokeswoman, who was not identified in keeping
with British custom, said she didn't have any further details about
a duck, but said, ``they do fly in from time to time.''

   Randy Owen, lead singer of Alabama, is
tired of hearing people say the group's seventh annual charity
bash, June Jam, will be its last.
   ``I don't know how all of that got started. But none of its
true,'' he said.
   Owen said the concerts ``will continue as long as the people of
the state of Alabama _ from the governor's office on down to the
people in Fort Payne who volunteer to work with us every year _
want it to go on.''
   June Jam VII is scheduled June 11 on a field behind Fort Payne
High School in the band's hometown. Artists scheduled to appear
with Alabama include K.T. Oslin, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Carl
Perkins, Mel McDaniel, Ricky Van Shelton, Gary Morris, Exile,
Restless Heart, Dan Seals, Charlie Daniels Band, Eddy Raven and the
Shooters.
   The June Jam festivities begin June 9, when Owen and band member
Teddy Gentry will play in a charity softball game with former
Atlanta Braves pitchers Phil Niekro and Rick Camp. The next day
there will be a benefit golf tournament with former New Orleans
quarterback Kenny Stabler, Auburn University football Coach Pat
Dye, and University of Alabama at Birmingham basketball Coach Gene
Bartow.
   The first five June Jams raised huge sums for charities, with
attendance peaking at 60,000 in 1986. Last year, the concert was
hit with heavy rains, attendance fell to 20,000, and there was
nothing left after expenses to give to charity.

   Hoping to buy time for victims of one of the
bleakest forms of cancer, a West German surgeon is repairing livers
outside the body, a procedure believed to be the first of its kind.
   ``I think it may help some patients for whom we couldn't do
anything else,'' said Dr. Rudolf Pichlmayr of the University of
Hannover Medical School.
   Pichlmayr said that he has removed, repaired and replaced livers
three times, including twice this month. Malignant liver tumors
left no choice, he said. The repairs took four to five hours.
   The patients, two women and a man, were doing well, Pichlmayr
said Thursday by telephone from West Germany.
   ``They are improved dramatically,'' he said. ``I'm afraid those
patients might get a reoccurrence of the disease. But I feel the
justification to do it because it's the best possible retaliation''
against cancer.
   He said that because of the nature of liver cancer, the patients
would probably eventually develop new tumors, either in the liver
or elsewhere, but the operation at least will prolong their lives.
   Previously, such bench surgery was limited to the
well-established repair of blood vessels or the removal of cysts
and tumors in kidneys, which are less delicate and less vital to
sustaining life than the liver.
   ``It's a very intriguing development,'' said liver transplant
pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh.
   ``I can see how it might be a significant advance, although we
really must wait and see,'' he said.
   ``My hat's off to him. It's a monumental effort,'' said liver
transplant surgeon Dr. John S. Najarian of the University of
Minnesota. He has tried liver transplants on four liver cancer
patients, only one of whom is still alive.
   Liver cancer is among the deadlier forms of the disease, said
National Cancer Institute spokesman Frank Mahaney. Early detection
gives patients a 10 percent to 30 percent chance of surviving for
five years. Late detection leaves a mere 3 percent chance.
   Pichlmayr performed the first operation Feb. 5 to remove cancer
that more than doubled the weight of a 40-year-old woman's liver.
   The woman has since returned home.
   He said a transplant might have wasted a valuable donor organ
because the cancer had spread beyond her liver, and he avoided
traditional in-body repairs because of the tumor's size and central
location.
   As he removed the organ, Pichlmayr installed a pump that kept
blood flowing through the two main explosed blood vessels. Outside
the body, the liver was cooled with ice water and flushed
periodically with a special fluid to keep it fresh.
   Pichlmayr described the procedure in a West German medical
journal in April.
   ``She's gained weight again, and at this moment she's very
healthy,'' he said. ``She was suffering extremely, and I think she
would not be alive now.''
   Pichlmayr performed liver bench surgery again May 6 on a
48-year-old woman and May 11 on a 58-year-old man.
   ``The lady is at home, quite well,'' he said. ``The man is still
in the hospital, but is good.''
   Also this year, Pichlmayr did the world's first split-liver
transplant, dividing one liver and implanting the halves into two
patients.

   A burglar used three aliases to stay out of jail
and one step ahead of the law, police said.
   Three times, using different names, Anthony Dearill Eiland
pleaded guilty to burglary, and each time was placed on probation.
   Investigators said they caught up with Eiland, as he's now known
by police, after eight months when they jailed a man named Joe
Smith last week and matched his fingerprints with three other sets
on file.
   Police said Eiland may have taken advantage of a backlog of
paperwork.
   Incomplete computer records used to research Eiland's burglary
cases at the district attorney's office alternately omitted Social
Security numbers and fingerprint ID numbers, said Norman Kinne,
first assistant district attorney.
   ``Unless you knew the names,'' he said, ``you wouldn't hit on

   The suspect was being held on more than $50,000 bail on charges
including burglary, violating probation, an evading arrest and an
investigative charge of failure to identify himself.

<HEAD>Sikhs Kill Seven; Security Corridor To Be Built Around Golden
Temple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh terrorists killed seven people
Friday in Punjab state, and two people died of injuries suffered in
an earlier bomb blast. The government announced plans to shut off
the Golden Temple to militant Sikhs.
   Home Minister Buta Singh, whose ministry is responsible for
internal security, told reporters the government would carve out a
100-yard corridor around the temple complex to try to keep
extremists from using the shrine as a hideout.
   The office of President Ramaswami Venkataraman announced that
India's 30-year-old Arms Act had been amended to provide stringent
punishment for the use of outlawed firearms.
   Under the amendment, a person convicted of possessing prohibited
arms such as rocket launchers could be sentenced to life in prison.
The government says Sikh extremists are bringing these more
sophisticated arms in from Pakistan.
   Previously, the maximum sentence was three years in prison.
   The moves came one day after the president issued an ordinance
making it illegal for temples and other religious sites to be used
for political purposes. The ordinance also would make harboring a
wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine.
   Two of the people who died Friday were Hindu laborers injured
Thursday when a bomb went off in a crowded market in the town of
Phagwara, in Kapurthala District east of Amritsar.
   The bombing was blamed on the Barbar Kalsa gang, one of a dozen
Sikh extremist groups operating in Punjab.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks on migrant workers.
Police believe the extremists are trying to drive Hindu laborers
out of the state and undercut its agricultural economy.
   Seven other deaths were reported Friday, including a Sikh father
and son shot to death by Sikh gunmen in Amritsar District, the
United News of India reported. There were no details on the other
slayings.
   The latest killings raised to more than 1,180 the number of
deaths blamed on Sikh extremists in Punjab since the start of the
year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people died.
   Most victims of Sikh violence have been Hindus, but moderate
Sikhs are also targeted by the militants who have been fighting
since 1982 for a separate nation in Punjab.
   Singh said houses and shops around the Golden Temple, Sikhism's
holiest shrine, would be razed to make way for the security
corridor. He said construction would begin soon, but he didn't give
a date.
   P. Chidambaram, Singh's deputy, said about 700 families and 300
shops would be displaced but that the government would set up a
resettlement program for those forced to move.
   The decision to build the corridor follows a 10-day siege by
police and paramilitary troops to drive Sikh radicals from the
temple. The stand-off ended May 18 when the last of about 200 Sikh
extremists and sympathizers inside the temple surrendered.
   At least 46 people were killed in the confrontation, most of
them militants.
   Police still patrol around the shrine, but security efforts are
hampered because scores of shops, houses and narrow alleys abutting
the complex provide cover for militants moving around the area.
   Singh, a Sikh himself, was asked if there was a political
solution to the situation. He responded: ``Do you think these
terrorists have any political aims other than their declared goal
of Khalistan? If that is the thing, then we don't have a political
solution.''
   Khalistan is the name that Sikhs envision for their nation.
Sikhs are a religious minority in India and claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus. They form the
majority in Punjab state.

   A shopping cart exploded into flames when
a customer unwittingly placed a tin can of fuel next to a car
battery, injuring the man and forcing the store's evacuation,
workers said.
   Ronald Sweeney on Thursday had placed a tin of Coleman fuel,
used in camping stoves and lanterns.
   The tin touched both posts of the battery, igniting the fuel,
said Kevin Bolin, a department manager.
   The flames set fire to some paper and cloth items in the cart,
Bolin said.
   ``When I got there, it was a big ball of flames,'' said stock
clerk Kelly Hamilton.
   Automatic sprinklers were activated and employees helped put out
the blaze with fire extinguishers as customers were hustled from
the building.
   Sweeney was treated at Owensboro-Daviess County Hospital for
burns to an arm and an ear and was released, a nursing supervisor
said.

   There's no free lunch at Uncle Bob's
Diner. In fact there's no lunch at all _ no sunny side up, no
french fries with gravy, no coffee.
   The only food on Jerry Berta's menu nourishes the soul.
   All that's cooking in the kitchen of what is now ``The Diner
Store'' are other diners _ only smaller.
   Berta, a 37-year-old sculptor, has been creating ceramic diners
for 12 years _ from art-deco salt-and-pepper shakers to diners
eight inches high and 15 inches long, with working neon signs.
   The diner-within-a-diner has fascinated Berta for years. But the
chance to set up his gallery in Uncle Bob's Diner, believed to be
Michigan's last remaining diner when it closed 15 years ago, was
more than he had hoped for.
   ``People all over knew about Uncle Bob's,'' Berta said Thursday.
``I had a guy from Madison, Wis., write to me, saying he'd spent
every night for four years in the '50s at this place.''
   Berta came across the 41-year-old, abandoned diner in Flint in
1986, bought it for $2,000 and had mobile home transporters move it
125 miles to the tiny town of Rockford, north of Grand Rapids,
where he's lived with his artist-wife for 15 years.
   He has spent the last year working on the 53-by-32-foot eatery
to restore its original pink formica ceilings, porcelain enamel
exterior and stainless steel sunburst patterns.
   ``It looks just the same as in 1947, when it was built,'' Berta
says, swiveling on one of the diner's original stools.
   While the gallery doesn't open for business until June 15, the
opening reception is Friday. All told, the project has cost him
about $50,000.
   ``It sounds real crazy, but it's going to be great making diners
in a diner,'' says Berta, sporting a tuxedo with bright-red bowtie
and high-top sneakers to match.
   ``Lots of times people are intimidated when they walk into a
gallery,'' he says. ``People are going to feel real comfortable
when they walk in here.''
   The kitchen will be his studio, and the counters and shelves
where miniature boxes of cereal undoubtedly sat years ago will be
the showplace for his art, which ranges from $60 to about $1,000.
   Inside some of the diners are tiny Coca-Cola signs and ceramic
utensils and food on counter tops.
   Berta said he became intrigued with creating his own
interpretations of the nearly extinct eateries after designing tiny
ceramic rooms.
   ``I did a diner one day and it was my favorite, so I just kept
going,'' he says.
   Berta and his wife, Madeline Kaczmarczyk, who creates ceramic
teapot sculptures and also will exhibit her work at the gallery, do
the majority of their business at art fairs and exhibits across the
country.
   And while they don't know how strong business will be in this
relatively conservative region in southwest Michigan, the two
Detroit natives hope to draw potential customers from as far away
as their hometown and Chicago.

<HEAD>Najib Chooses New Prime Minister As Soviets Withdraw</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One word for Najib cq</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib chose a new prime
minister from outside his governing party in an effort to widen his
support base as Soviet troops withdraw, leaving the government to
face Moslem guerrillas alone.
   However, the president's choice, 62-year-old Mohammad Hasan
Sharq, has been closely associated with the party. He has been a
deputy prime minister in Najib's government for the past 11 months.
   His promotion, announced late Thursday by official Kabul radio,
must be approved by the National Assembly, which is expected to
convene in a few days. Confirmation is virtually certain because
the body is controlled by Najib's People's Democratic Party and
allied groups.
   Sharq was entrusted with primary responsibility for repatriating
an estimated 5 million refugees _ one-third of the country's
population _ who have fled since Soviet troops entered Afghanistan
in 1979 to help the government in its war with the guerrillas.
   He would replace Prime Minister Sultan Ali Keshtmand, a ranking
member of the governing party since its founding in 1965.
Keshtmand, 52, was appointed to the post in 1981 by Najib's
predecessor, Babrak Karmal. Keshtmand was named secretary of the
central committee of the governing party.
   Najib has repeatedly professed a desire to bring more non-party
men into his government as Moscow withdraws its troop.
   However, the test of whether such a declaration will have real
basis or be primarily cosmetic may come when Sharq's Cabinet is
named.
   ``If they simply move to reshuffle the furniture, it's not going
to be significant,'' a Western diplomat said Friday.
   Most of the current 34 Cabinet members are either members of the
party or closely tied to it. The exact breakdown is unknown because
of the shadowy nature of Afghan politics.
   Najib's declarations of plans to broaden his government has not
ended guerrilla attacks.
   From their bases in Pakistan, the guerrillas have announced they
captured at least a dozen Afghan army border posts since April 15,
when the Soviet Union agreed to start pulling out its troops.
   Under the withdrawal agreement, the more than 10,000 Kremlin
soldiers in Afghanistan are to leave by next February. Moscow says
9,000 already have crossed the Amu Darya River into the Soviet
Union since the withdrawal began May 15.
   Najib's choice of Sharq as prime minister also appeared to
lessen the chances of former King Zahir Shah returning to Kabul to
preside over any transition from the present Soviet-style socialist
government to a more broadly-based government.
   The restoration of the king, in a role ranging from figurehead
to active player, has been a topic of speculation in both Eastern
and Western diplomatic circles since the Kremlin decided to end its
military intervention.
   Sharq was Cabinet chief of staff when Mohammad Daoud, a cousin
of the former king, served as prime minister from 1953 to 1963.
However, during that decade, the king exercised little power.
   Daoud resigned in 1963 at Zahir Shah's behest and then overthrew
him in 1973.

   Dartmouth College has doubled the number of
incoming top freshman students by flying in many of them for a VIP
tour of the campus, the school said Friday.
   Of the 201 top high school seniors targeted under the
Presidential Scholars program, 63 have picked Dartmouth _ double
its enrollment of top scholars last year, spokesman Alex Huppe said.
   Dartmouth also expects a record number of women in its freshman
class of 1,100. Applications from women were up 13 percent over
last year and this fall's class is expected to be 44 percent women,
up from 38 percent last year, Huppe said.
   The percentage of minority freshman will increase by 2 percent
to just more than 20 percent, the school said.

<TEXT>
   An ex-convict tricked a lawyer into sending
him a resume then assumed the attorney's identity, collecting
thousands of dollars in legal fees and defending a man in court
before disappearing, authorities said.
   James Klaver was out of prison awaiting retrial in a rape case
when he began impersonating Richard Keffler, a real-life lawyer in
Texas who also practices in Florida, Seminole County authorities
said.
   Klaver had all the credentials of a lawyer, including an ID card
from the Florida Bar and numerous law books.
   He collected more than $3,000 in retainer fees from clients and
appeared before Orange County Circuit Judge Ted Coleman on April
18, representing a drug user.
   Coleman said Wednesday he had been suspicious about Klaver but
didn't say anything at the time.
   ``I thought he was the defendant,'' said the judge. ``I guess to
judges, lawyers are like pornography _ we don't know what it is,
but we know it when we see it.''
   The case eventually was reassigned to a real lawyer, with the
client pleading guilty to cocaine possession.
   Investigators said Klaver, who was released from prison in
December when his conviction and 60-year rape sentence were
overturned, had called Keffler in March.
   Keffler said Klaver claimed to be a business owner planning to
expand into Texas. He said the man wanted him to handle the firm's
legal matters. Keffler sent Klaver his resume.
   Within weeks, Klaver was pretending to be Keffler, police said.
   Seminole County sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Human and Deputy Robin
Yolton said Klaver moved into an office also used by attorney
Angela Blakeley after telling her he was being placed on a list of
lawyers available for court-appointed work.
   Klaver began taking cases and accepting fees.
   ``He appeared legitimate,'' said Ms. Blakeley. ``All his
references checked out.''
   Officials discovered the ruse after a man charged with writing
bad checks complained that his lawyer had abandoned him after
collecting a $200 retainer.
   Investigators have asked the state attorney's office to file
charges of forgery, obtaining property by false impersonation and
theft against Klaver.
   A spokesman for the Florida Bar, Jerry Butterfield, said the bar
may have to tighten controls on its ID cards, possibly adding
photographs.
   Ms. Blakeley said that when Klaver disappeared, he took more
than $10,000 in law books and computer equipment, including all her
business records, and collected about $10,000 from her own clients.
   He fled in a car he bought under the name and credit rating of
Keffler, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Five old trucks and buses, driven by U.S.
veterans, left the capital Friday as part of the nationwide
``Veterans Peace Convoy'' bearing food, medical supplies, clothing
and toys for the children of Nicaragua.
   The contingent will merge June 5 in Austin, Texas, with several
other conveys that originated in northern cities a week ago. Then
the entire group, involving 50 vehicles and 100 drivers, will begin
the drive through Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras to Nicaragua.
   Robert Livesay, a Dorchester, Mass., veteran who hatched the
project and heads the group that started in Boston, said a total of
about 40 tons of humanitarian aid will be delivered by the convoy
to private relief agencies in Nicaragua.
   ``This is a people-to-people project to feed children, not a
government one to feed war,'' Livesay said.
   The veterans' drive also is designed to promote the larger ``Let
Nicaragua Live'' program, under which various peace groups plan to
send 4,200 tons of oats to Nicaragua via container ships this year.
   The various legs of the convoy will pass through 40 states, with
stops in 90 cities, Livesay said. Other groups started in Seattle;,
Missoula, Mont.; Minneapolis; Dayton, Cleveland and Cincinnati,
Ohio, and Portland, Ore.
   Among the donated supplies driven by the veterans are hospital
equipment, powdered milk, and oral rehydration salts to help battle
diarrhea, the No. 1 cause of death among Nicaraguan infants. The
trucks also will carry stuffed animals and baseball equipment for
the children.
   Livesay said he got the idea for the drive during a trip to
northern Nicaragua last fall on behalf of the Veterans for Peace.
   When another veteran mentioned the possibility of a U.S.
invasion aimed at Nicaragua's leftist government, he said,
``Something clicked. I said he ought to invade this place ourselves
with a convoy of real humanitarian aid.''
   Livesay said, ``The kids were saw were malnourished, with
discolored hair and distended stomachs, without clothes. The war
had really begun to destroy the ability of the people in the
countryside to produce.''
   ``I saw the situation developing the same way it did in
Vietnam,'' said Livesay, who worked for the Air Force security
branch in Vietnam and Thailand in the 1960s. ``I couldn't believe
that after 20 years, we just hadn't learned our lesson.''
   He said the relief materials will be handed over to
non-governmental social service agencies in Nicaragua, including
the Institute of John XXIII and the Red Cross.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch had five non-cancerous
lesions removed from his face Friday morning.
   He said three were caused by exposure to the sun and the other
two were from an inherited condition.
   ``They are common and benign lesions,'' Koch said.
   He said he visited a dermatologist, Richard Green, who gave him
a local anesthetic and removed the lesions in about 20 minutes.
   He said no further medical treatment is required and that he has
been placed under no restrictions.
   He said he was advised to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.
   ``I have always believed it is a good idea to follow doctor's
orders. But as we begin what promises to be a beautiful and bright
Memorial Day weekend, it may not be easy to do,'' he said.

   President Reagan said Friday that he
and his advisers have not had a chance to discuss new American
moves in the drive to pressure Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega out of power.
   ``We have had no opportunity to consider where we go'' from
here, Reagan said in response to questions about Noriega's
insistence that he intends to reamain in charge in Panama.
   Reagan was questioned as he appeared at a picture-taking session
with Finland's President Mauno Henrik Koivisto at the presidential
palace on the second day of his pre-Moscow summit rest spot.
   Reagan also side-stepped a question as to whether he would use
military force in Panama.
   ``I can't answer as to what might be the possibilities,'' he
said. Reagan said ``it would be wrong'' to talk about options.
   Pressed to respond to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams' refusal to rule out the use of military force, Reagan said
again, ``I won't comment on the possibilities.''

<HEAD>Best Advice for Drugs in Pregnancy: Ask A Doctor
^With AM-Accutane Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The best way to avoid harmful drugs during
pregnancy is to refrain from all medications, except those
specifically approved by your doctor for use during your pregnancy,
medical authorities say.
   In addition, consumers can learn about pregnancy-related risks
of a drug by asking a pharmacist to see the labeling, or by
checking the pharmacist's copy of the Physicians' Desk Reference.
   Here is a partial list of drugs other than Accutane that experts
recommend avoiding during pregnancy, or which should be taken only
with approval of a physician:
   - Aspirin.
   - Blood-thinning drugs derived from a substance called coumarin.
They are taken for heart-related disorders.
   - Cancer drugs that are cytotoxic, which means they kill cells.
   - Drugs containing any male or female hormone such as estrogens,
progesterone or anabolic steroids.
   - Some anticonvulsants; a physician can prescribe lower-risk
ones.
   - Cough syrup with a large percentage of alcohol.
   - Minor tranquilizers such as Valium or Librium.
   - Etretinate, used for severe psoriasis.
   - Vitamins A or B. In large doses they are linked to birth
defects.

<HEAD>Air Force Decides Against Suspending Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force announced today it would
continue to allow Eastern Airlines the right to carry military
passengers but said it would closely watch the carrier after
inspectors reported ``performance deficiences.''
   The Military Airlift Command said Eastern was the subject of a
``commercial carrier survey'' in March. Air Force inspectors said
they found ``performance deficiencies which, if not corrected,
could affect the safety of the half-million DOD (Department of
Defense) personnel who annually fly on Eastern aircraft.''
   The airline handled about $87 million worth of military travel
business in fiscal 1987.
   The decision to extend Eastern's right to handle military
business was made by the Commercial Airlift Review Board, a panel
created in the aftermath of the December 1985 crash of a chartered
Arrow Air DC-8 that left 248 soldiers dead.
   Eastern was told April 11 that suspension proceedings were being
started.
   Officials of the airline met with the Air Force on April 25 and
convinced the service they were addressing the problems, Lt. Col.
Nick Lacey, chief of the Air Carrier Survey Office, said today.
   ``They went out of their way to address these as serious
concerns,'' Lacey told a reporter. The Air Force ended up extending
Eastern's right to carry military passengers but also decided to
continue in-flight survey observations, he said.
   ``The book is still open,'' Lacey added.
   Lacey said the Air Force survey team expressed concern about
pilot turnover, poor morale among both air crew and maintenance
personnel, antagonism between management and employees and the
level of manning for certain operations. The military inspectors
also questioned whether Eastern was doing enough to audit and
oversee contractors providing maintenance service, Lacey said.
   Eastern is a unit of Texas Air Corp. that is locked in bitter
dispute with employee unions. Last month, the airline was the focus
of an unusally broad safety investigation by the Federal Aviation
Administration that involved inspections of all of its airplanes.
   Corporate officers of Eastern maintain most of the complaints
about airline operation can be traced to disaffected union workers
and that the carrier is not scrimping when it comes to safety.
   ``They (the Air Force) did have some questions concerning
airline safety and maintenance,'' said Paula Musto, an Eastern
spokeswoman in Miami. ``But we reviewed everything with them and we
think we satisfied their questions. We welcome any inspections,
observations or whatever.''

   The two competing delegate lists that emerged
from last weekend's fractured Georgia Republican Party convention
overlap by 30 names _ 15 delegates and 15 alternates.
   Both sides this week released their lists of delegates after the
convention, which was sharply divided between party regulars, most
of whom support Vice President George Bush for president, and party
dissidents.
   Georgia's final 48-member delegation to the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans is expected to be decided by a court
battle, an appeal to the Republican National Committee, and
possibly an appeal to the full convention.
   All of the state's delegates must vote for Bush at the August
convention because the vice president swept the state's March 8
primary.

   Charles Cooper, head of the Justice
Department's Office of Legal Counsel, today became the latest aide
of Attorney General Edwin Meese III to hand in his resignation.
   Cooper said in a letter to Meese that he will leave the
department July 8 and he said in an interview that he doesn't have
a job.
   ``I'm just at the beginning of this process'' of trying to find
work with a private law firm ``rather than at the end,'' Cooper
said.
   But the resignation is ``wholly unrelated to the controversy of
today,'' Cooper's letter said in a reference to Meese's legal
troubles and a recent series of departures by key aides at the
Justice Department.
   Meese wrote a letter back to Cooper thanking him for ``your
loyalty, support and special vote of confidence.''
   ``Some will be tempted to characterize my resignation in ways
that suit their purposes,'' Cooper said in his letter.
   But he said that ``I hasten to stress that in leaving the
Department, I am carrying through with plans formed in a calmer
time and based on a host of personal and professional
considerations.'' Cooper said he had long planned to leave the
department this summer to enter private law practice.
   While the head of the legal counsel's office has remained loyal
to Meese, Justice Department sources said Cooper had serious doubts
about remaining at the Justice Department two months ago, following
the abrupt resignations of Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and
criminal division chief William Weld.
   Cooper's announcement comes several weeks before independent
counsel James McKay is to issue a report on his year-old criminal
investigation of the attorney general which is expected to raise
questions about Meese's ethical conduct.
   ``I am acutely aware ... that this is a time of controversy for
you and for the Department, and thus is not the most opportune
moment for members of the Department's leadership to be
departing,'' said Cooper.
   His letter praised Meese for promoting a strict interpretation
of the Constitution, a restoration of authority to the states and
the principle of nondiscrimination.
   Meese has criticized the courts for not adhering to the intent
of the framers of the Constitution. He has argued in favor of
federalism, a more equitable balance of power between the state and
federal governments. The attorney general has constantly criticized
racial quotas in hiring and promotion as well as the widespread use
of affirmative action goals and timetables.
   Cooper, who has been at the department almost seven years, is
resigning at a time when polls show that a majority of the general
public has an unfavorable view of Meese, whose involvement with
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. has placed the attorney general under
constant criticism for more than a year.
   A Washington Post-ABC New Poll released Thursday found that 51
percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable impression of Meese,
while only 9 percent had a favorable impression and 40 percent
expressed no opinion.
   In addition, 38 percent said he should resign, while 9 percent
said he should not. The poll surveyed 1,508 Americans by phone and
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Cooper, who played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to
win a Supreme Court seat for Robert H. Bork, has been negotiating
with several law firms for some time, said sources at the Justice
Department, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Cooper is the latest Justice Department official to announce his
departure in an exodus which began March 29 with the protest
resignations of Burns and Weld. Burns and Weld quit out of concern
that Meese's refusal to resign was hurting the Justice Department's
operations, morale and public image.
   Cooper recently traveled to Panama to participate in
negotiations with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and
Cooper was among a handful of political advisers chosen by Meese to
conduct a weekend inquiry in November 1986 into the
administration's secret arms sales to Iran. The inquiry uncovered
the diversion of some of the arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan
rebels, triggering the Iran-Contra affair.
   There has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections
of the Justice Department in the past two months.
   Five of Burns' deputies left following his resignation,
virtually emptying the No. 2 office in the department, and two of
Weld's aides quit when he did.
   Last week, Meese's chief spokesman Terry Eastland disclosed the
attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously
enough. The head of Meese's speechwriting unit resigned within
hours of Eastland's disclosure.
   It took Meese nearly two months to find replacements for the
posts vacated by Burns and Weld. Burns' successor, Utah trial
lawyer Harold Christensen, will fill the slot on an acting basis,
pending completion of the Senate confirmation process. Weld's
replacement, Edwards S.G. Dennis Jr., the U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia, also will serve on an acting basis.

   Another member of the Federal Energy

with two vacancies and only one sitting member with a regular
appointment.
   Commissioner Anthony Sousa, 60, whose second four-year term
would have expired in October, will leave the commission July 31 to
become U.S. bankruptcy trustee for northern and eastern California
and Nevada, based in San Francisco, the commission announced Friday.
   Two of the three remaining members, Chairman Martha Hesse and
Charles Stalon, are holdovers. Their terms expired last October,
and unless successors are confirmed earlier, they must leave this
coming October. President Reagan has renominated Ms. Hesse as
chairman, but the Senate Energy Committee has not acted on the
nomination.
   The term of Charles Trabandt also expires in October. The fifth
member, Charles Naeve, resigned last month.
   Sousa is a former vice president and general counsel of the
Hawaiian Telephone Co. and a former counsel and administrative law
judge at the California Public Utilities Commission.
   Bankruptcy trustees work under the supervision of bankruptcy
judges in administering bankruptcy cases.

<HEAD>Two Waive Hearings In Lottery Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two city men charged with using a bogus
lottery ticket to claim a $15.2 million jackpot waived preliminary
hearings Friday and were scheduled to appear for arraignment in
July.
   Henry Arthur Rich, 33, a computer troubleshooter for a company
that helps run the lottery, is charged with using his expertise to
identify an unclaimed jackpot and forge a winning ticket.
   Officials allege Rich provided Mark S. Herbst, also 33, with the
bogus ticket and the two planned to split the winnings. Charges
were leveled against the men May 3, less than a week after Herbst
traded in the ticket for the first installment of the July 15,
1987, jackpot, $469,989.
   The two men appeared briefly in the chambers of District Justice
Bob Yanich. After the men waived the hearings, Yanich scheduled
arraignments in Dauphin County Court for July 7.
   Rich remains free on a $50,000 bond. Herbst was returned to
Dauphin County jail, although his bond has been reduced from
$50,000 to $25,000, Yanich said.
   Authorities have charged Rich with two counts of theft, one
count of conspiracy, one count of tampering with records, one count
of forgery and one count of unlawful use of a computer. Herbst is
charged with two theft counts, one conspiracy count and one forgery
count.
   If convicted, Herbst would face up to 31 years in prison and
$70,000 in fines. Rich would face 40 years in prison and up to
$90,000 in fines.
   Herbst told lottery officials he had been using the ticket as a
bookmark.

<HEAD>Physical Education Professionals Say Kids Need to Shape Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools should revamp physical education programs
to help the nation's out-of-shape young people become fitter and
learn to exercise regularly, a fitness expert said Friday.
   ``We've got an alarming problem with the deteriorating state of
fitness in American kids,'' said Donald F. Haydon, executive
director of the American Health and Fitness Foundation. ``There's
no question that our kids are far more sedentary than 20 years
ago.''
   The Austin-based foundation _ which recently completed a fitness
survey of 20,000 schoolchildren, primarily in Texas _ presented its
study at the American College of Sports Medicine annual convention.
   Haydon, former director of the Texas Governor's Commission on
Fitness, said his group has developed a pilot program, called Fit
Youth Today, to encourage young people to improve cardiovascular
fitness through regular exercise.
   The program was tested last fall in 17 Texas school districts.
This spring, it is being used by a number of districts throughout
the country, he said.
   Previous fitness programs simply tested students once annually
through programs such as the one sponsored by the President's
Physical Fitness Council. But the FYT program includes an
eight-week training program of running and calisthenics, followed
by a four-part test.
   Haydon said that of the 20,000 students participating in last
fall's study, 29 percent reached the program's fitness standards
after the eight-week regimen.
   Part of the problem is that schools emphasize prowess at the
expense of general fitness, said William G. Squires, an associate
professor of biology and physcial education at Texas Lutheran
College in Seguin.
   The researchers also said parents should take an active role in
encouraging their children to pursue physical fitness.
   ``Parents check their kids' math homework, but how many parents
actually pay attention to the fitness levels of their kids?''
Squires asked.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS last 2 grafs with 4 grafs of explanation from Reynolds'
deputy that criminal division didn't look at GOP's possible

wanting to influence the election.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's civil rights chief
leveled a scathing attack against Congress for exempting itself
from civil rights laws and denied that he lied to senators last
year about a Louisiana voter challenge case involving the
Republican Party.
   ``It is almost laughable to sit here and listen to these grand
protestations by members of Congress about this administration's
civil rights record,'' William Bradford Reynolds told the Senate
Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
   Referring to frequent complaints from liberals that the Reagan
administration is trying to turn back the clock on civil rights,
Reynolds said, ``This chamber has not seen fit in over 200 years to
reach out and even once wind the civil rights clock that watches in
forced silence over its activities.''
   Congress has exempted itself from a myriad of civil rights laws
dealing with discrimination in employment and other areas.
   Senate Judiciary Committee members did not respond directly to
Reynolds' comments, but Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., strongly
criticized Reynolds for adopting a confrontational approach to
dealing with civil rights issues.
   Kennedy cited a Feb. 22 memo circulated in the Justice
Department in which Reynolds said that ``we must polarize the
debate'' in the waning months of the administration on issues
ranging from AIDS to capital punishment to prison conditions.
   ``When it comes to civil rights under the Reagan administration,
Reynolds is the name and polarization is the game,'' Kennedy said.
   When Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., questioned whether polarizing the
debate was ``prudent,'' Reynolds replied that ``I stole a page from
your own book'' and said Kennedy had been confrontational as well.
   Reynolds is counselor to Attorney General Edwin Meese III as
well as assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights
division.
   Another judiciary committee member, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, accused Reynolds of lying last year and of rejecting
subordinates' advice to launch an FBI investigation into a
Republican Party voter registration challenge in Louisiana.
   Metzenbaum disclosed memos by Reynolds' civil rights division
subordinates urging that the FBI look into possible criminal
violations of the Voting Rights Act in connection with a GOP voter
registration challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in
Louisiana in 1986.
   One memo to Reynolds, dated Oct. 7, 1986, from an attorney in
the voting section, Rebecca Wertz, said that if the voter
registration challenge were to be found to be a conspiracy to
disenfranchise black voters, that would be a criminal violation of
the Voting Rights Act. She noted that it is a crime punishable by
up to five years in prison to deprive anybody of a right under the
voting act.
   In March 1987, Reynolds told the committee that it was the
conclusion of ``everybody who looked at the matter'' from the
division's voting section that ``there was no ... violation of the
Voting Rights Act that would allow us to go in and prosecute.''
   ``You misstated the facts; you lied to the committee,''
Metzenbaum told Reynolds, who responded that Metzenbaum was stating
``half-truths.''
   Reynolds said that another part of the Justice Department, the
criminal division, was consulted on the matter and concluded that
no criminal investigation was warranted. However, after the
hearing, one of Reynolds' deputies, Jim Turner, said that the
criminal division reviewed whether blacks were fraudulently
registered, but did not review whether the GOP's challenge to the
voters might have violated the law.
   Reynolds and Turner insisted that subordinates in the civil
rights division ended up agreeing that no FBI probe was needed.
   Since the case involved the Republican Party, ``I wanted to be
darn sure I wasn't going to do something they would question us
about later,'' Reynolds said.
   After the hearing, Turner said that the decision not to launch
an FBI probe before the election was made out of concern that the
existence of an FBI investigation might influence the outcome of
the election.

<TEXT>
   Riot police kicked and clubbed
anti-government protesters Friday and fired tear gas grenades after
President Roh Tae-woo ordered that all measures be taken to crush
violent demonstrations.
   Roh, presiding over a meeting of the National Security Council,
said the dissident protests threaten the safety of the Olympic
Games, which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   As part of tightened security preceding the Games, a Cabinet
minister ordered police to maintain surveillance on foreigners
spending long periods of time in South Korea without a definite
purpose.
   In downtown Seoul, angry passers-by shouted ``Shame!'' as some
of an estimated 7,000 riot police fired tear gas and repeatedly
charged about 3,000 radical students.
   Police chased protesters into subways and tossed tear gas
grenades at passers-by who protested. Several officers lifted a
protesting businessman in a blue suit above their heads and carried
him away.
   Police broke up an attempted sit-in at City Hall and an attempt
by about 500 students to march toward the U.S. Information Service
library. They arrested dozens of students, beating and kicking many
of the protesters and hitting them with clubs as they were dragged
away.
   There were no reports of injuries, and police did not give an
overall arrest figure.
   Some students hurled firebombs and rocks at police, but most
just chanted anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!''
and ``Drive out the Yankees!'' they yelled.
   Radical students claim the United States supports military rule
in South Korea and enforces partition of the Korean peninsula,
divided since 1945. The protesters demand the expulsion of the
42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   Protesters have attacked U.S. diplomatic buildings during the
protests, including the U.S. Embassy. No Americans have been hurt.
   Protesters have also demanded that South Korea and North Korea
serve as co-hosts of the Olympics as a move toward reunification of
the two countries.
   Roh called the radicals a threat to the safety of the Games and
said, ``It is imperative that all possible measures be taken to
forestall acts of violence by domestic radical groups.''
   Roh also warned that North Korea ``may stage any kind of
adventure and provocation to mar the success of the Games.''
   Home Minister Lee Choon-koo, who is in charge of the nation's
135,000 police, ordered the watch on certain foreigners to prevent
infiltration by terrorists at the Olympics.
   The government inaugurated a 13,000-member police Security Task
Force to guard Olympic athletes and facilities. Members were
selected for martial arts and foreign language skills.
   Police also distributed 5,000 leaflets nationwide with portraits
of seven people suspected in the hijacking in 1970 of a Japanese
jetliner to North Korea by the terrorist Red Army group.
   One person suspected in the hijacking, Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, was
arrested in Tokyo after returning from North Korea on a false
passport, police said.
   In Tokyo, a police spokesman said officers were questioning
Shibata to try to determine if the Red Army planned any renewed
terrorist action.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 5,000 people marched
peacefully to mark the anniversary of the end of a 1980
anti-government uprising in which at least 191 people died.
   A memorial service was held in Kwangju, about 165 miles south of
Seoul. Afterward, marchers, with a coffin bearing pictures of the
dead, walked through the city.
   Radicals claim Roh, an army general at the time, helped direct
the police action.

   A jury has been selected for former Gov.
Evan Mecham's trial on charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Eight jurors and four alternates seated Thursday were sworn in
today in Maricopa County Superior Court.
   Opening statements are set for Thursday, one day after the
defense will ask the Arizona Supreme Court to send the charges back
to a grand jury for reconsideration.
   Mecham's lawyers contend prosecutors misused the grand jury
process in seeking the indictment.
   Mecham, 63, is charged with six felony counts of perjury,
willful concealment and filing false documents and faces up to 22
years in prison if convicted on all counts.
   His brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, Willard Mecham, faces
three similar counts and up to 9{ years in prison.
   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office April 4 when the
Senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment charges.
   He also was impeached for failing to disclose the $350,000 loan
from Tempe developer Barry Wolfson, but the Senate did not hear
that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial.
   The jurors were chosen from a pool of 99 who filled out long
questionnaires aimed at ferreting out bias. Thirty-seven of them
were questioned in court this week to create the 24-member pool
from which the jury was selected.

<TEXT>
   By shuffling the summit schedule and
questioning delegations set to meet with President Reagan, Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is sending an unmistakeable signal that
he intends to seize the initiative during the pair's Moscow
face-off.
   The challenge facing Reagan as he awaits the start of the summit
Sunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter it
to compete with the Soviet leader.
   The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talks
opening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of the
people who hoped to meet with Reagan.
   One of two summit sessions scheduled for Monday was scrubbed,
although the time allotted for the two leaders to meet _ 6 hours _
was maintained.
   The Soviets gave no specific explanation, saying an ``internal
function'' required the cancellation.
   The White House, puzzled at first, decided to describe the
decision as ``mutual'' and not make a fuss.
   Moreover, Gorbachev will take the unprecedented step of holding
a news conference next Wednesday, the day before the summit ends,
according to an official Soviet source who spoke only on condition
he not be identified.
   Never before has a general secretary of the Soviet Communist
Party met formally with reporters on home territory, the source
said.
   Meanwhile, a Leningrad ``refusenik,'' Roald Zelichenok, said in
a telephone interview that KGB secret police had warned him against
accepting an invitation to meet Reagan on Monday.
   The Jewish dissident, who has been refused permission to
emigrate to Israel for more than 10 years, said he was told ``in
light of security measures'' around Moscow, he would not be
permitted to leave Leningrad.
   There were reports, too, that some of the church officials due
to meet Reagan at the Danilov monastery also were being kept away.
   The White House said Thursday that everyone invited to attend
both gatherings would be there.
   And in Moscow, officials showed no concern over the meetings and
sought to minimize their impact.
   Vladimir F. Petrovsky said ``the U.S. President ... is certainly
free to decide who of Soviet citizens he finds interesting and
useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events.''
   But, he added, ``this American move is hardly aimed at improving
mutual understanding between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.''
   Reagan has arranged for Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House
chief of staff, to make a flight to Helsinki with the text of the
treaty the two leaders signed last December in Washington to
abolish land-based nuclear ballistic and cruise missiles in the
range of 300 to 3,4000 miles. The Senate is in the final stages of
ratifying the pact.
   If the Senate acts in time, Baker on Saturday will bring the
instruments of ratification with him to Helsinki. They will be
presented in ceremonial exchange with Gorbachev. Reagan intends to
use the occasion to extol the agreement _ his only dent in the
nuclear arms race in 7{ years in office.
   Gorbachev clearly has another agenda in mind for the summit, one
that does not focus on human rights _ or even arms control.
   With negotiations stymied on a bigger treaty to reduce
long-range nuclear weapons, Gorbachev is looking elsewhere to give
the summit some substance. His sights are focused on regional
hotspots, and he has begun to make his moves.
   The first, of course, was completing an agreement in Geneva to
withdraw the Soviet troops that have occupied Afghanistan since
1979.
   The second was the word passed by Vietnam, a Soviet ally, that
it would withdraw 50,000 soldiers from Cambodia. Gorbachev's third
move, which could come at the summit or directly afterward, is the
prospective withdrawal of 50,000 to 100,000 Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe.
   These bold initiatives are bound to win Gorbachev points for
peace around the world. And they could put Reagan on the defensive
in Moscow.
   Two years ago, at the Iceland summit, Reagan was forced to
respond to Gorbachev's arms control initiatives.
   This time, the president may have to adjust his script to the
Soviet leader's oneupsmanship on the ground.

   Cattle producers and cattle and beef importers
voted overwhelmingly to support a $1-per-head marketing checkoff to
finance a national beef promotion and research program, the
Agriculture Department said today.
   Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles said that about 79 percent
of the 256,505 valid ballots cast in the May 10 referendum, or
202,408, favored the program, while 21 percent, or 54,097, were
opposed.
   Only a simple majority of those voting was needed for approval.
   The program is paid for by a fee of $1 per head on all domestic
and imported cattle and an equivalent fee on beef imports. It was
established under federal legislation approved in 1985 and began
operations on Oct. 1, 1986.
   The law required that a referendum be held to determine whether
producers and importers wanted to continue the program.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will hold a

   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Gorbachev's news conference would be on Wednesday, the same day

   A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that no general secretary
has held a general news conference in the Soviet capital in the

   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, who did not want to be

would be made public at a later date.
   On Thursday, Nikolai Shishlin, deputy head of the Central
Committee's information department, was asked at a news conference

<TEXT>
   A woman who apparently set up
housekeeping in David Letterman's house while he was out of town
and took his sports car for a spin has been re-arrested after
returning to his home, authorities said today.
   A woman identified variously as Margaret or Mary Ray, 36, of no
known address, was charged with burglary Thursday night, police
said. The arrest came a day after she was released by New Jersey
authorities because Letterman said he didn't want her prosected.
   Authorities said the woman initially identified herself as
Margaret Ray, but then said she referred to herself as Mary Ray.
New Canaan police said today they had documentation that the
woman's name is Margaret M. Ray.
   Letterman, host of NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman,''
was not home at the time Thursday, police said.
   Ray was jailed on $15,000 bail, said police Capt. Michael
Angelastro.
   Ms. Ray was first arrested Sunday at the Lincoln Tunnel on a
charge of receiving stolen property as she was driving into New
York from New Jersey with a 3-year-old passenger. She didn't have
the $3 toll, authorities said.
   ``I'm Mrs. David Letterman and this is David Jr.,'' Ms. Ray was
reported by authorities to have told the toll collector. ``Don't
you think David Letterman is good for the toll?''
   The 1988 Porsche was registered to Letterman, who was contacted
and said the woman was not his wife and did not have permission to
drive his car, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   Sgt. Harold Pipher of the Port Authority Police said Letterman,
a bachelor, said he didn't know the woman.
   Sgt. Paul Wadleigh at the Hudson County Jail said earlier today
that the stolen property charge had been dropped and that Ms. Ray
had been released.
   After her first arrest, New Canaan police discovered that
someone had broken a living room window to enter Letterman's modest
three-bedroom home, Angelastro said.
   Ms. Ray appeared to have moved into the house with the child and
lived there for the last couple of days, Angelastro said.
   But Sgt. Robert Cole said Thursday that Letterman didn't want
Ms. Ray prosecuted, apparently because ``he doesn't want the
attention this might attract.''
   An NBC spokesman in New York said Thursday that Letterman had no

<TEXT>
   State-paid lawyers for Florida's death
row inmates say they can no longer defend their clients because
they are out of money and have asked the state Supreme Court to
halt all executions or have counties pay up.
   Five men are scheduled for execution between June 22 and July 8,
but their lawyers don't have money to travel to hearings or summon
expert witnesses, Larry Spalding, director of the Office of Capital
Collateral Representative, said Thursday.
   He accused Gov. Bob Martinez of signing death warrants on
``sheer whim'' to keep the pressure on defense lawyers. Spalding
blamed his money woes on an unprecedented number of pending death
warrants and being forced to move his office to more expensive
quarters when the Tallahassee municipal government took over its
former building.
   Spalding on Thursday asked Florida's high court to halt all
executions or order counties where the convicts were sentenced to
pay their legal costs.
   The court scheduled oral arguments on the request for June 7.
   Martinez has signed 20 warrants since the beginning of the year,
almost as many as in all of 1987. Only one execution, however, has
been carried out so far this year, that of Willie Jasper Darden on
March 15.
   Joe Spicola, the governor's general counsel, responded that
Spalding's inability to handle his agency's budget is a perfect
example of why Martinez has ordered a criminal investigation of the
office.
   The governor earlier this year directed the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement to examine the agency's handling of funds and
allegations that witnesses used by the its lawyers may have
committed perjury.
   Spicola said he cannot understand Spalding's budget problems
because his budget was increased from $800,000 in the last budget
year to $1.4 million for the year ending June 30.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Phantom of the Opera'' is losing its
leading lady, Sarah Brightman, on June 4, one month earlier than
expected and one day before the Tonys are awarded.
   Miss Brightman, who was to have stayed with the lavish British
musical until the beginning of July, has a concert engagement at
the end of June with the Berlin Philharmonic, Philip Rinaldi, a
spokesman for the show, said Friday. She will appear with the
orchestra in an evening of music by her husband Andrew Lloyd
Webber, the man who also wrote ``Phantom.''
   The $8 million musical, Broadway's biggest hit in years, was
almost scuttled when Actors Equity denied permission for Miss
Brightman to appear in the New York production. The actors union
later changed its mind, allowing her to perform for six months.
   Miss Brightman will be replaced on June 6 by Patti Cohenour, who
already plays the role of Christine, the young opera singer, for
two performances each week. Michael Crawford, Miss Brightman's
co-star, will remain with the musical through Oct. 8, Rinaldi said.

<HEAD>Unsolicited Donations Pour in To Repair Vandalism to Vietnam
Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $60,000 has been raised to repair
scratches made by vandals on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, thanks
to the efforts of veterans organizations and radio stations
nationwide, a fund-raising official said Friday.
   ``People have been exceedingly generous,'' Jan Scruggs, founder
and president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said.
   Scruggs, whose struggle to get the memorial built will be
portrayed Sunday in the NBC-TV movie ``To Heal A Nation,'' said he
was surprised that so many people were interested in contributing
money to repair the memorial, which has become the most heavily
visited monument in Washington since it was dedicated six years ago.
   The National Park Service on May 2 said it had discovered 8-inch
scratches, including one resembling a swastika, on two of the
memorial's 140 polished granite panels. Scratches also were found
later on a third panel on the 493-foot wall, which contains the
names of those killed in the Southeast Asian war.
   Scruggs said neither the fund nor the Park Service solicited
contributions. Instead, the money, which he called ``gratifying,''
was raised by groups and individuals who decided on their own to
make donations following news accounts of the vandalism _ the first
ever reported at the memorial.
   A Vermont granite expert has been studying ways to remove the
scratches from the polished granite, Scruggs said. The cost of
repairs was not yet known.
   In the meantime, a stone expert has been hired to make temporary
repairs by filling the scratch marks with synthetic resin that
matches the mirror-like surface of the panels, according to Park
Service spokesman Earle Kittleman.
   ``After the repairs are made, we will use the extra money to buy
more granite so we will have panels ready to make replacements if
the need arises,'' Scruggs said.
   Officials at the Park Service and the veterans fund still are
hoping to find out who vandalized the memorial. U.S. Park Police
have been patrolling around the clock since the damage was
revealed, Kittleman said.
   On Monday, the Park Service and the fund will hold their
traditional Memorial Day ceremony at the memorial, with speeches
military music and a wreath laying.

   Dick Ferry no longer will have to use the
bank's automatic teller machine to hear the voice of his Scottish
dream girl _ he can just turn on the radio.
   Sally Masterson is trading her London talk-show for a job at WDZ
in this central Illinois city of about 94,000.
   ``The ... amazing thing is that we can't go anywhere without
people asking us about her,'' said Ferry, 61, who wrote a column
about his infatuation with her voice. ``People have taken her to
their hearts and I think they feel a lot of pride in her coming
here.''
   Ferry's column about the taped voice on a Decatur bank's
automatic teller, which Ms. Masterson had recorded, appeared Feb. 4
in the Decatur Herald & Review.
   The newspaper tracked down Ms. Masterson, 30, and brought her to
Decatur in April to meet Ferry and his wife and tour the city.
   ``I think he's smashing,'' she said.
   ``I thought she was charming,'' Mrs. Ferry said, and her
husband, an education professor at Millikin University, agreed.
   Ms. Masterson told the Herald & Review earlier this week that
she has accepted a broadcast job with WDZ radio and will arrive
Sept. 5.
   David Webb, vice president and general manager of WDZ and WDZQ
said Ms. Masterson will have a midday show Monday through Friday,
with the format still to be worked out.
   ``It could be losing some of its magic to see her grocery
shopping,'' Ferry joked about Ms. Masterson's intended move.
   ``I said I was in love with a voice, and I was,'' he added.
``But, I'm in love with my wife. I would hope that Sally is a good
friend.''

   Jo Manolidis had been struggling for
two weeks to get AT&T to replace her telephone when 21 bright red
numbers arrived in three cases at the door.
   Ms. Manolidis, owner of Jo's Beauty Salon, said she was glad to
finally have her phone service back and a red unit was exactly what
she wanted, but 21 seemed a bit excessive.
   ``The girls at work called and said, `Do you know you have 21
phones here and they all are red?''' she said Thursday.
   The saga began when Ms. Manolidis was told by AT&T on May 6 she
could pick up a replacement for her leased phone at a local outlet.
   That outlet, however, was out of the model she wanted, so she
ordered one. It never came. So while visiting Omaha on Saturday,
she picked up a new red telephone.
   When she plugged in the new telephone at her salon Monday, the
line was dead. She called AT&T to report the faulty telephone and
was told they would have one to her by Friday.
   Ms. Manolidis said she needed one sooner than that and was told
that would mean an extra charge for an emergency delivery. She
objected but was forced to hang up before the controversy could be
resolved.
   The next day the 21 red telephones arrived via overnight mail.
Accompanying instructions asked her to send back the faulty
telephone she'd picked up in Omaha.
   An AT&T official said Thursday she didn't know what caused the
mistake. She guessed it was probably a typing error.

<TEXT>
   Dogs will keep their tails and chickens
may fly the coop under a law passed Friday to improve the lives of
domestic animals.
   The Ministry of Agriculture said the law, drafted by the
governing Social Democrats, would allow animals ``to behave
naturally.''
   The bill, which takes effect July 1, mandates a minimum living
space for chikens, fur animals and pigs. It also says calves should
stay with their mothers for not less than two months before being
sold.
   The bill was prompted by an animal rights campaign led by Astrid
Lindgren, the author of children's books who created the character
Pippi Longstocking.
   Within 10 years, farmers will have to release chickens from
cages and allow them to roam outside. The law makes Sweden the
second country in the world after Norway, to ban the cropping of
dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons.
   A parliamentary committee also asked the government to oversee
the labeling of cosmetics so that products tested on animals are
marked as such. It said moves should be taken to ban such testing.
   Parliament rejected language that would make it illegal to keep
cows in stalls all year but said farmers must give the animals a
chance to go outside during the summer.
   The bill also calls for the licensing of riding schools and
farms for fur animals.

<TEXT>
   When radio personality Casey Kasem and
his wife, Jean, sent out invitations to a $1,000-a-person
fund-raiser for Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, they didn't
expect such an explosive reaction.
   The invitations to the ``Rainbow Roundup'' at Spago restaurant
June 5 were delivered by private delivery service this week in
burlap-wrapped gift boxes that contained chocolates and a miniature
cowboy boot.
   But some people feared the suspicious brown packages left on
their doorstep at night were letter bombs, the Glendale News-Press
reported.
   Maha Youness, 17, balked when a man at her front gate intercom
asked her to pick up the package delivered to her parent's home at
9 p.m. Monday. Home alone, she called police.
   Glendale police also were suspicious of the package and called
in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Bomb Squad. After an
inspection, the package was deemed safe.
   Some celebrities had similar reactions, said Mrs. Kasem, who was
married eight years ago to Kasem in a ceremony performed by
Jackson, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Singer Barry White and his wife, Glodean, cleared a room in
their house, she said. Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd was
also reportedly shaken. And actress Isabel Sanford of ``The
Jeffersons'' was also upset by the invite, Mrs. Kasem said.
   ``I had no idea that I would be scaring everyone, or that
(officials) would be called out to defuse my invitations,'' she
said.

<HEAD>92 Percent Of Kindergartners Pass First-Grade Readiness Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Results of a controversial first-grade readiness
test administered to 90,434 Georgia kindergartners last month show
that 92 percent passed, education officials said Friday.
   The test, criticized by some as being too stressful for
5-year-olds and 6-year-olds, is required under the Quality Basic
Education Act, enacted in 1985.
   This year, for the first time, passing the test is generally a
prerequisite for entering the first grade. The rules give districts
the opportunity to make exceptions for children who fail if the
teacher believes they should be promoted.
   ``The passing rate on this test is pretty much what we
anticipated,'' said Stan Bernknopf, director of assessment for the
state Department of Education. State officials had estimated that
90 percent would pass the test.
   The test instrument was the California Achievement Test.
Possible scores ranged from 187 to 602, with the pass-fail cutoff
set at 443 and the average for Georgia students at about 532.
   State School Superintendent Werner Rogers said Georgia
kindergartners scored above the national average in all three areas
of the test, with 79 percent exceeding the national average for
math, 75 percent for visual recognition and 73 percent in sound
recognition.
   Children are asked such things as to count the number of items
in a picture and tell what item in a picture doesn't fit in with
the others.
   While 7,396 students did not meet the cutoff score, that doesn't
necessarily mean they won't be promoted to first grade, Rogers said.
   If a child's teacher believes he or she is ready for first-grade
work but the test score falls below the cutoff point, the child
will be reassessed, he said.
   Georgia is the only state to administer a paper-and-pencil test
to kindergartners as a condition for promotion, and some early
childhood experts have argued that standardized tests are too
stressful for young children.
   But Bernknopf said that he ``never thought it was stressful at
all.''
   ``When kids are taking a test and they know it's for real, they
do a little better,'' he said.
   John Vaughn, director of guidance counseling and testing for
Fulton County, said the test may not be a good diagnostic tool if
so many pupils earned a passing score.
   ``I'd like to have all them pass, but the nature of testing is,
if it is valid ..., there would be a higher percent not passing,''
he said.

   Commuters set fire to one train, threw

failures delayed service, a railroad official said.
   Hundreds of riot troopers took about four hours to disperse the
angry commuters. Two policemen were slightly injured and no one was
arrested, the Sao Paulo state police said.
   A spokeswoman for the commuter train service said at least 1,000
commuters to Sao Paulo were in the three stations, but she had no
estimates on how many joined the rock-throwing mobs.
   Nine railroad cars of one train were ``totally destroyed by
fire, and the same number of cars of another train were partially
damaged by rocks thrown by the mobs,'' spokeswoman Edith Villas
Boas said.
   She said mechanical failures caused delays for several hours.
   About 400,000 mainly low-income workers use the commuter service
daily.

   Secretary of State George Shultz
attended a Sabbath dinner Friday night with American, Russian and
Finnish Jews and served notice that the human rights issue would
have ``pride of place'' in President Reagan's summit talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev next week.
   ``We can't see for the life of us why people shouldn't be
allowed to live their lives the way they want to live them,'' said
Shultz, who was warmly applauded when he entered the meeting room
in the Jewish community center here.
   Morris B. Abram, president of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, told Shultz that his unwavering support for Soviet Jews
would be one of his legacies as secretary of state.
   ``What a difference you have made,'' said Abram, an Atlanta
lawyer who once marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Reagan is scheduled to meet Monday with a group of Jewish
``refuseniks'' whom the Soviets have denied permission to emigrate
to Israel.
   Jerry Strober, a spokesman for the Soviet Jewry conference, said
Soviet authorities had detained several would-be participants in
the meeting with Reagan, including two in Leningrad and a few
others in Kiev and other cities.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Soviet authorities
had been asked about the reports of detainees. But he said the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow had received assurances from the Soviets that
they will not block ``refuseniks'' and dissidents from attending
the meeting.
   ``The event is on as scheduled and the people we wanted there
will be there,'' Fitzwater said.
   As Shultz entered the hall at the Jewish community center, the
60 guests burst into song, chanting ``Shalom Alechem'' (Peace Unto
You) in Hebrew.
   Among the participants were Lev Elbert, a former dissident who
lives in Israel, and Anna Roznovsky, who became first violinist
with the Tel Aviv Philharmonic after she received her exit permit.
   There are 1,000 Jews in Finland, out of a population of 4.5
million. It is one of a handful of countries that refused to turn
Jews over to the Nazis for extermination in World War II.
   ``There are those who say we are so few we are not a minority
but a curiosity,'' said Gideon Boloyovsky, president of the
Helsinki Jewish community.
   Shultz said he came to the dinner because ``there are people we
care about who have problems.''
   He said there had been improvements in the Soviet Union but the
struggle will continue. ``We will never stop, we will never give
up,'' Shultz said.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded in a park Friday in
an attempt by Sinhalese nationalists to assassinate Prime Minister
Ranasinghe Premadasa and two other government officials, police
said.
   Premadasa and the other ministers were not hurt in the blast,
said Gamini Gunewardene, deputy inspector general of police. The
bombs detonated prematurely about 200 yards from where the men were
chairing an outdoor public meeting, he said.
   Police found a third bomb and defused it, Gunewardene said.
   ``It was a clear attempt to assassinate the ministers,''
Gunewardene told The Associated Press by telephone from the town of
Muwara Eliya, where the explosions occured.
   Muwara Eliya is in central Sri Lanka, about 55 miles northeast
of Colombo.
   The officials had gone there to campaign for next Thursday's
provincial elections. It wasn't known how many people were at the
meeting. Police said it was ``well attended.''
   Gunewardene said two critically injured Sinhalese men were found
at the bomb site. The men were believed to be carrying the bombs
toward the meeting when they went off.
   Gunewardene said the injured men were being treated and would be
interrogated later.
   Both were believed to belong to the nationalist Sinhalese
People's Liberation Front, Gunewardene said.
   The front is opposed to the peace accord signed last July to end
the nearly five-year Tamil separatist war in the north and east of
the island.
   The front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 290
politicians and government workers since the agreement was signed
July 29 by President Junius R. Jayewardene and Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Many members of the island's majority Sinhalese community
contend that the pact makes too many concessions to the minority
Tamils.
   The other ministers at the meeting were Lands Minister Gamini
Dissanayake and Rural Industries Minister Sayuramoorthy Thondaman.
Dissanayake has been mentioned as a possible successor to
Jayewardene.
   The prime minister's office in Colombo refused to comment on the
incident.
   In Colombo, police arrested a Sinhalese man after he was found
carrying a long knife on a visit to a minister's home.
   The man, who was not identified by name, was arrested when he
tried to meet Transport and Moslem Affairs Minister M.H. Mohamed at
his Colombo residence.
   Sinhalese, who are Buddhists, account for 75 percent of the
island's 16 million population.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent. They claim
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the
government and the army.
   The accord has failed to bring peace because the most powerful
of the Tamil separatist groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, has rejected it.
   India, which has a large Tamil population of its own, has sent
more than 50,000 troops to the island to try to put down the
Tigers' rebellion.

   The owner of an electronics company has
pleaded guilty to conspiring to ship military radios to Iran.
   Bernard Bowitz agreed to the plea in an arrangement with the
U.S. attorney's office Thursday.
   A 1985 federal indictment charged that Bowitz Electronics USA
promised to sell up to 6,000 radios to Iran through two Iranian
agents operating out of Spain.
   The radios were the type used by the U.S. Army, Marines and NATO.
   Bowitz also pleaded guilty on behalf of his company to a charge
of planning to illegally export $300,000 in listening devices to
Indonesia.
   His wife, Rachel, agreed to plead guilty to illegal possession
of a machine gun and to a charge of planning the illegal export of
radios to Jordan.
   The couple and their company face potential fines and
restitution payments of at least $4.6 million, according to court
documents. The crimes also carry maximum five-year prison terms,
but the government stipulated that prison sentences be suspended.
   Under the plea bargain, Bowitz has agreed to leave the United
States within six months of his sentencing, scheduled June 29.

<HEAD>`Don't Drink the Water,' Schools Tell Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Students in a rural Alabama school district and in eight Boston
schools were told, ``Don't drink the water,'' after potentially
hazardous matter was found in their drinking supplies.
   The order to stop using the water at Snow Hill School, about 40
miles southwest of Montgomery, Ala., came Thursday on the last day
of class. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management, which
tested the water earlier this month, found that its coliform
bacteria count was more than 25 times the level considered
potentially dangerous.
   Coliform bacteria are normally found in animals' colon; in water
supplies, they indicate contamination by fecal matter. Continued
high exposure to the bacteria make a person more susceptible to
digestive disorders, said Catherine Lamar, a spokeswoman for the
environmental agency.
   In Boston, the problem was excessive amounts of lead, discovered
in the water supplies of eight public schools in a television
station's survey. The report prompted testing at all city schools
over the Memorial Day weekend, said John Stobierski of the state
Department of Public Health.
   ``These schools that have high levels of lead or those that we
don't have results for will be on bottled water when schools reopen
on Tuesday, after the holiday,'' Stobierski said.
   The drinking water at Snow Hill School was ``as bad as you can
get,'' said Joe Power, chief of the ADEM's public water supply
branch. ``It's like drinking untreated water from a creek or
river.''
   Power said samples taken by his agency May 16 showed the water
to be contaminated at more than 25 times the potentially dangerous
level of coliform bacteria. School systems in the state are
supposed to test their water monthly and report bacterial levels to
the state, and the agency stepped in when it failed to receive the
reports from the district.
   He said students at Snow Hill have been drinking well water
contaminated at more than seven times the danger level since
January, when the school reopened after being shut for 15 years.
   The 347 students were switched to Snow Hill from a school in
Pine Hill after state officials ordered the county not to use the
Pine Hill school, which was plagued by leakage of raw sewage and
other problems. A fire destroyed the main campus building at Pine
Hill last fall.
   Power said stomach aches, viruses or other illness contracted by
students since January possibly could have been caused by the
drinking water.
   The district's superintendent, Odell Tumblin, said she does not
believe the problem is as serious as ADEM indicates.
   ``That water is clear and pure and a lot of families in the area
have been using the same well for years,'' she said. ``I don't see
how the water system got poisoned just because the students got
there.''
   A new high school is being built in Camden, but school officials
plan to use Snow Hill at least another year.
   Boston's WNEV-TV had water samples from 24 elementary schools
analyzed and discovered that 10, including two private schools, had
lead levels exceeding federal standards.
   Stobierski said the tainted water was unlikely to cause acute
lead poisoning, but said scientists still don't fully understand
the chronic effects of low-level lead poisoning.

   An adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said Friday that the United States is violating a peace accord by
continuing to ship arms to Afghanistan's anti-communist Mujahedeen
guerrillas.
   ``They are arming, quite openly, those who want to go on in
their civil war,'' said Yevgeny Primakov, who has advised Gorbachev
on arranging the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   Primakov, head of the Institute of the World Economy and
International Relations, did not specify when the United States
sent its most recent arms shipment to the Mujahedeen.
   No did he say whether continued U.S. shipments might halt
withdrawal of the estimated 105,500 Soviet troops who are still in
Afghanistan.
   ``This means that the United States will jeopardize the
situation,'' Primakov told a news conference for reporters covering
next week's summit talks between Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   ``It means they will push Pakistan into a corner,'' he said.
``It destroys the Geneva accords.''
   (In Washington, State Department spokesman Ben Justesen said in
response to Primakov's charges:
   (``The turnover of large amounts of military supplies
constitutes a continuation of military aid. The Soviets should take
their military equipment out with them. We will watch Soviet
actions in this area carefully and will follow symmetry in making
our decisions.''
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of staff of the Soviet armed
forces, told reporters Thursday that 9,500 of his troops have left
Afghanistan since the pullout began May 15.
   Under the peace accord, the Soviet withdrawal is supposed to be
completed by early 1989.
   Primakov's charge appeared to be part of a pattern of protests
aimed at pressuring Pakistan and the United States to stop aiding
the Mujahedeen.
   On Thursday, the Afghan government lodged its fourth protest
with a U.N. observer mission, accusing Pakistan of continuing to
channel arms to the guerrillas.
   The guerrillas have said they will continue to fight the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul and will ignore the Geneva
accords signed by Pakistan and the Kabul regime.
   The United States and Soviet Union agreed to act as guarantors
of the agreement. In an exchange of letters, each side agreed to
stop arming its allies in Afghanistan if the other followed suit.
   The letters, which have not been made public, also are reported
to have specified that if either side continued to arm its Afghan
ally, the other would provide a commensurate level of weapons to
its side.
   Moscow has halted its arms shipments, Western diplomats say, but
is leaving Soviet military bases and massive arms supplies to the
Kabul government as its forces pull out.
   The United States has been supplying the Mujahedeen with an
estimated $500 million annually in arms and military supplies
channeled through Pakistan.
   About 2.5 million Afghans have fled to Pakistan since the
Soviets invaded Afganistan in December 1979, and the Mujahedeen
operate out of basis on Pakistani soil.
   China and Saudi Arabia also have supplied arms to the Mujahedeen
but have not signed the Geneva accords.
   An additional 1.5 million Afghan refugees are living in Iran,
which is supporting Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla groups.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Divided On Reimposing Martial Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old-guard lawmakers from the governing
Nationalist Party called for the return of martial law Friday after
violent protests that injured hundreds of people, but their younger
colleagues denounced the idea.
   Martial law was lifted in July after 38 years in force. Last
Friday and Saturday, riot police and demonstrators battled in
Taipei for 18 hours, and there has been talk the government might
bring back martial law.
   More than 200 people reportedly were injured and 96 protesters
were detained in the riots, which broke out after a farmers' rights
demonstration. The violence was the worst on this island since
1947, when native Taiwanese staged an uprising against Nationalist
forces who had arrived from the Chinese mainland.
   A group of 75 legislators issued a statement calling the recent
rioting ``a bloody incident unprecedented in 40 years.'' They urged
the government to partially reimpose martial law because the nation
had reached ``the moment of life and death.''
   The statement said violent protests threatened national security
and Taiwan's economic development.
   Most members of the Legislative Yuan who signed the statement
were elected on mainland China shortly before 1949, when they and
the rest of the Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing
a civil war to the Communists.
   The Nationalist government claims to be the rightful ruler of
all China.
   A group of 27 lawmakers comprised mostly of Nationalist
legislators elected in Taiwan issued a statement opposed to a
return to martial law and said it would drive ``the vehicle of
democracy backward.''
   The rioting was a temporary disorder and the government should
not easily give up its achievement in democracy, the statement said.
   Since the lifting of martial law, under which demonstrations
were banned, protests have been held almost daily by dissidents and
other groups pressing a wide variety of political and economic
demands.
   Newspapers reported Thursday that members of the party's
policy-making Central Standing Committee held heated discussions at
a weekly meeting Wednesday about whether the government should
reimpose martial law.
   Taipei police, meanwhile, turned down an application by a
farmer's group to march in Taipei on Tuesday, claiming the
organization violated demonstration laws during previous protests.
   Lin Feng-hsi, spokesman of the group, said the farmers wanted to
march to apologize to Taipei residents for last week's violent
protest.
   Also Friday, the Nationalist Party announced that three sons of
the late President Chiang Ching-kuo were elected delegates to the
Nationalist Party congress this summer.
   Chiang, who died in January, was the son of Chiang Kai-shek, who
led the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949. He was the main architect
of the recent policies of easing the Nationalists' authoritarian
grip on Taiwan and allowing unofficial contacts with China.

<TEXT>
   A 300-mile carpet of algae along the
southern coast of Norway and Sweden has killed tons of salmon and
rainbow trout, a Norweigan newspaper reported Friday.
   The single-cell algae has killed all marine life down to a depth
of 26 feet in some parts of Skagerrak Strait between Denmark and
Norway and in the Kattegat belt between Denmark and Sweden, the
Oslo daily Aftenposten said.
   Denmark, alarmed by weather reports showing the algae could be
blown to its shores, dispatched a research boat Friday to track the
growth.
   ``I've never experienced anything like it. The situation is
highly dramatic,'' Arne Nielsen, head of the Sea Pollution
Laboratory of Denmark's Environment Ministry, said Friday.
   Nielsen blamed nitrates and phosphorus washed into the sea from
farms.
   Authorities say the algae is not harmful to humans, but it turns
to slime on the gills of fish and chokes them to death.
   The algae growth extends about 310 miles along the southwest
coast of Sweden from Goteborg to the oil center of Stavanger,
Norway.
   Wild fish such as herring and flounder have not been as hard hit
as the trout and salmon grown by Norwegian farmers in seaside pens,
experts said. Those farmers have been advised by marine biologists
to slaughter their fish.
   Some major fish farms in western Norway have started to tow
their nets away from coastal areas into Norway's deep, cool fiords
to avoid the algae threat.
   Marine biologist Einar Dahl said it could take weeks or months
for the algae to disappear, according to the newspaper.
   He said the algae has always been present in the North Sea but
never in such quantities.

<TEXT>
   A 31-year veteran undercover officer whose
testimony helped convict an officer of the scandal-ridden 77th
Precinct has been arrested on drug charges, authorities said.
   Detective Eugene Poulson, 56, of Queens, who had spent the last
13 years in the Internal Affairs Division investigating corrupt
cops, was himself arrested by IAD investigators Thursday, IAD Chief
Daniel Sullivan said.
   ``He was a very dedicated and good performer,'' the chief said.
``I'm shocked and saddened that he would give up his 30 years of
police service and his pension for this brief encounter.''
   In 1987, Poulson had posed as a cocaine dealer during an
investigation of police corruption at the 77th Precinct, which
resulted in the indictment of 13 officers. Videotapes of Poulson
offering an officer a $500 payoff for protection helped convict the
officer.
   A unidentified woman arrested in April on drug charges told
narcotics officers Poulson had introduced her to drugs four years
ago, Sullivan said. The woman contacted Poulson and he agreed to
meet her Thursday night at a house police had wired for sound.
   Investigators said Poulson possessed slightly less than an
eighth of an ounce of cocaine that he was going to give to the
woman. ``There were indications he had been using drugs recently,''
Sullivan said.
   The detective refused to take a drug test on the advice of his
attorney. There were no indications that Poulson had been dealing
cocaine, or that he had obtained the narcotic from police seizures,
the chief added.
   Poulson was charged with one count of drug possession and two
counts of drug possession with intent to sell. The maximum penalty
for the last two counts is a prison term of up to 25 years.
   Poulson earned about $50,000 a year. Under police regulations,
he was eligible to retire with a pension worth two-thirds of his
annual salary after 30 years.

   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev received encouragement from on high Friday for their
summit talks next week.
   ``We as people hope that the summit brings peace,'' cosmonaut
Vladimir Titov said in a live television interview as he orbited
Earth in the Soviet space station Mir, which means ``peace'' in
Russian.
   A group of reporters in Moscow asked Titov and fellow cosmonaut
Musa Manarov about Gorbachev's comment in a recent interview with
The Washington Post and Newsweek magazine that he will ask Reagan
to support a joint U.S.-Soviet mission to Mars.
   ``As for joint scientific projects, our country has always been
for them. We confirm that,'' said Titov, who wore a gray-blue
flight suit. He predicted that a manned expedition to Mars could be
carried out within 10 years.
   Gorbachev did not specify whether he was proposing a manned or
unmanned flight to Mars. Other Soviet officials said Gorbachev
envisioned an unmanned mission.
   Titov, 41, who is from the Siberian town of Sretensk, has been
aboard the Mir spacecraft as commander since December. Mir was
launched in February 1986 as a permanent manned space station, and
cosmonauts have been conducting scientific and medical experiments
on board since it soared into orbit.
   Titov and Manarov, a 37-year-old member of the tiny Soviet
ethnic group called the Lakets, spoke by television to reporters
who toured the Soviet mission control center north of Moscow.
   Stepan F. Bogodyazh of the Glavkosmos space agency said the
Soviet Union had developed detailed plans for a joint Mars
expedition. ``We hope our leaders will have time to discuss these
proposals,'' he said.

   Iranian gunboats attacked a Maltese
freighter and set it ablaze Friday in the Strait of Hormuz. It was
Iran's fourth raid in 10 days on ships sailing to or from Saudi
ports.
   Iran apparently was retaliating for a spate of Iraqi raids on
its oil- shipping lanes, including one attack that devastated five
tankers May 14.
   Iran targets vessels trading with Saudi Arabia or Kuwait because
it accuses the two oil-rich powers of aiding Iraq, its enemy in the
7{-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   The 18,000-ton Don Miguel was left burning fiercely after the
morning attack in the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf.
The 18-member South Korean crew abandoned the vessel, shipping
executives said.
   The executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
the Iranians fired at a helicopter chartered by the U.S. television
network CBS when it approached the site of the attack. The aircraft
was not hit.
   The shipping officials said they were not aware of any U.S.
warships, which patrol the gulf to protect shipping, near where the
Iranians struck.
   In the past 10 days, Iran has attacked three other foreign
ships. The Don Miguel was hit about 12 hours after the
Norwegian-operated Mundogas Rio was attacked in the same area,
about 25 miles south of Iran's Larak island oil terminal.
   Kuwait turned to the United States and the Soviet Union for
protection of its vital oil shipments from such attacks last year,
putting 11 tankers under the U.S. flag and chartering three others
from Moscow. On May 3, the Pentagon broadened its role in the gulf
to allow U.S. ships to aid stricken vessels that aren't flying the
Stars and Stripes.
   Oman, which shares with Iran control of Hormuz, sent a small
gunboat to help the Don Miguel and pick up crewmen from lifeboats.
Tugboats of the Dutch firm Smit helped fight the fire, which burned
for hours.
   Executives said the ship was badly damaged.
   The Don Miguel is Greek-owned with a Maltese
flag-of-convenience. The vessel was under charter to the
London-based Trans Ammonia, international traders in sulphur.
   Shipping executives said the vessel was heading for the Saudi
port of Jubail to pick a load of the sulphur but would now be towed
to Fujairah, outside the Hormuz, for inspection of damage.

   A Dutch ship carrying highly
flammable chemicals sank Friday after a collision with a Swedish
freighter, a coast guard spokesman said.
   One sailor was reported missing from the Anna Broere, which was
carrying 1,600 tons of acrylon nitryl at the time of the collision
with the Atlantic Compass about 50 miles off this fishing port.
   A navy helicopter took another crewman to a hospital near here
but the coast guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the nature of his injuries was not known.
   He said the Anna Broere's 10 other crew members were taken
aboard the Swedish ship.
   The collision occurred at 5 p.m in one of the world's busiest
shipping lanes. The cause was not known immediately.
   According to the spokesman, the Atlantic Compass was bound from
Goteborg, Sweden, to Antwerp, Belgium, but the Anna Broere's
destination was not known. It sailed from Rotterdam earlier Friday.
   Acrylon nitryl is a chemical used in the plastics industry.
Contact with the eyes or skin can cause serious injury.

<TEXT>
   Americans' disposable personal incomes fell
0.9 percent in April, the steepest drop in a year, as tax payments
took a big bite out of paychecks, the Commerce Department reported
Friday.
   It was the first decline in disposable income since last
November and the biggest setback since a 2.5 percent plunge in
April 1987 when federal taxes took an even bigger chunk of
Americans' incomes.
   Faced with higher tax bills, Americans balked at taking on any
big purchases, leaving spending basically unchanged in April after
a big 0.8 percent rise in March.
   Before adjusting for taxes, personal incomes edged up a tiny 0.1
percent in April after a giant 1.1 percent rise in March.
   Analysts said they were not unduly concerned about either the
weak income growth or the lackluster spending in April, saying the
month was influenced by a host of special factors.
   They noted that in addition to tax bills, spending was also
depressed by the impact of an early Easter which meant consumers
did their shopping in March, siphoning off sales that normally
would have occurred last month.
   The income gain looked weaker because the March figure had been
inflated by annual bonus payments made to workers at Ford Motor Co.
plus a big jump in farm subsidy payments.
   Excluding those factors, incomes before taxes would have risen
0.6 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March.
   But economists said that the big drop in the important category
of disposable income will have some effect in coming months.
   ``After the shock they got in April, I think people will adjust
their withholding statements to have more taken out of their
paychecks. That will be a slight damper on consumer spending,''
said John Hagens, senior economist at the WEFA Group, an economic
forecasting firm.
   But analysts said they were not too concerned because of
Thursday's reoport that the economy was far stronger in the first
three months of the year than previously believed. The government
revised its estimate of overall growth, as measured by the gross
national product, up to a brisk 3.9 percent, compared to an
original estimate of 2.3 percent GNP growth.
   Hagens said he now believed that growth for the year would come
in at between 3.5 percent and 4 percent, up as much as a full
percentage point from his original forecast.
   The National Association of Business Economists released a new
survey Friday which also boosted the growth estimate for the year
to 2.9 percent, compared to a forecast a month ago of GNP growth of
2.2 percent.
   Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National
Bank in Los Angeles, said the survey, taken in mid-May, would
probably show even higher forecast now, based on the big revision
to the GNP. The economy grew 2.9 percent in both 1987 and 1986.
   But still a majority of those polled, 57.4 percent, believed
that a recession would begin in 1989, brought on by rising
inflation and higher interest rates.
   ``We see inflation coming in at 5 percent and that will cause
the Federal Reserve to tighten further and that will raise interest
rates,'' she said. ``Higher interest rates are normally the way we
get into recessions in this country.''
   The big decline in disposable incomes in April pushed the
savings rate down to 3.8 percent last month, compared to a rate of
4.7 percent in March.
   The Commerce Department report said personal tax payments
climbed at an annual rate of $36.2 billion in April, compared to a
March increase of $10.9 billion.
   But this was still down from a huge $85.5 billion surge in tax
payments in April 1987, a year when many Americans ended up owing
more because they had sold long-time investments at the end of 1986
to escape higher capital gains taxes under the new tax law.
   Wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of $7.9 billion in
April, down from a March increase of $15 billion which had been
inflated by special bonus payments made by Ford Motor Co.
   Farm income fell $7.6 billion last month compared to an increase
of $19.4 billion in March, with federal subsidy payments accounting
for the wide swing.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell by $4.3
billion while purchases of non-durable goods dropped $14.1 billion.
Purchases of services, which include housing costs, climbed $11.6
billion.

   A woman was sentenced Friday to 14
years in prison by a judge who blamed cocaine and teen-age
motherhood for the tragedy that resulted in her 9-year-old daughter
losing her legs to frostbite when she was locked in an unheated
apartment.
   Workers boarding up an abandoned, unheated Gary house Jan. 17
discovered Darlwin Carlisle alone and pleading for help from a
barricaded apartment. Surgeons who amputated her legs below the
knee said gangrene had set in four to five days before she was
found.
   Her mother, Darlwin Britt, 25, pleaded guilty May 6 to felony
child neglect, over the objections of her attorney, in a plea
agreement that dropped two other counts and avoided a trial in
which her daughter would have had to testify against her.
   ``I think it's probable this wouldn't have happened but for
cocaine,'' said Lake Superior Court Judge Richard W. Maroc.
Nevertheless, he said she appeared to love the child she had when
she was 15.
   ``When we're talking about children having children and drugs
being involved, is it any wonder these things happen?'' he said.
   Ms. Britt admitted to cocaine use and asked Maroc whether she
would be sent to a drug rehabilitation center for treatment. He
told her he would recommend that she receive counseling and
treatment in prison.
   Maroc said Ms. Britt had no criminal record, but he added four
years to the standard 10-year term, citing the length of time the
child was left in the freezing apartment and her permanent
disability.
   Investigators said the girl had been in the apartment for nearly
10 days during a bitter cold spell of near-zero temperatures.
During that time, Ms. Britt told school officials her daughter was
missing classes because of a cut on her foot, Maroc said.
   The court accepted the plea bargain over the objections of
defense attorney Daniel Toomey, who said prosecutors lacked
sufficient evidence to show Ms. Britt intended to harm her daughter.
   He said Ms. Britt accepted the bargain because she feared
receiving the maximum 20-year sentence if she were convicted by a
jury.
   Under questioning by Maroc, Ms. Britt repeated her willingness
to accept the deal, saying, ``I don't want to go to trial.''
   She offered no explanation, but the Rev. Cozetta Olive, a
minister who has counseled Ms. Britt, said she woman wanted to
spare her daughter further trauma.
   Child welfare authorities placed Darlwin Carlisle in the home of
her paternal grandmother, Katie Carlisle of Gary.
   ``Her physical recovery is superb,'' said Deputy Prosecutor
Karen Coulis. ``Her emotional recovery will be much longer, perhaps
for life.''

   Former President Nixon says a proposed fifth
Reagan-Gorbachev summit after the Democratic and Republican
conventions this summer would be meaningless unless both parties'
presidential candidates also agree to attend.
   Such a meeting, Nixon said, ``would be a ludicrous three-ring
circus.''
   President Reagan held out the possibility of yet another summit
before he departed Wednesday for summit talks with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow next week.
   The German newspaper Die Welt quoted Reagan as saying the
Soviets are interested in concluding a Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks or START treaty with him, rather than waiting until his
successor takes over in January.
   Nixon said that with only five months remaining before the Nov.
8 presidential election, too little time remains for the Reagan
administration to complete an arms control agreement that would be
in the national interest.
   ``Once the two major parties choose their tickets for the
general election, an incumbent's authority _ in Soviet eyes _ drops
to nil,'' he said.
   ``Any summit after the two conventions will be meaningless
unless both the Republican and Democratic nominees agreed to
attend. In the unlikely event that they did, it would be a
ludicrous three-ring circus.''
   Nixon's views are contained in a column he wrote for this
weekend's editions of the Sunday Times of London. A copy was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Nixon, who had three summit meetings with Soviet leaders while
he was president, said Reagan doesn't have enough time left as
president to resolve several important Soviet-American issues.
   Among them, he said, are the relationship between defensive and
offensive weapons systems, whether to allow mobile strategic
missiles, and verification of cruise and mobile missiles.
   Therefore, Nixon said, Reagan should concentrate in Moscow on
conventional arms control and regional political conflicts.
   Trying to rush the START talks toward settlement ``would put the
United States in the intolerable position of negotiating against a
deadline in questions that directly affect our survival,'' Nixon
said.
   Even signing a draft agreement would be a mistake, he said.
   ``That would lock the next administration into an approach that
focused excessively on cuts in the number of nuclear weapons
instead of the critical issue: the stability of the strategic
balance,'' he wrote.
   Nixon said the centerpiece of the U.S. approach should be
conventional arms control in Europe and not any goal of making
equal cutbacks in U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe.
   ``While American forces would retreat to the other side of an
ocean, Moscow's forces would simply take a short train ride to the
western border of the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``Instead, we should
seek asymetrical reductions in the Kremlin's armies.''
   The former president said progress on U.S.-Soviet economic
cooperation must be linked to resolving regional disputes in which
Moscow's actions threaten American interests, ``if we want
Gorbachev to take our positions on these issues seriously.''
   ``If we do not insist on linkage at the Moscow summit, we will

   The Communist Party has outlined a series of
reforms that could sweep away many political and judicial remnants
of Stalinism. But it has failed to say how it will transform the
economy.
   The changes are sketched in a program that will be debated next
month at a party conference considered crucial to the future of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   The document, published in Soviet newspapers Friday, was
approved at a Central Committee meeting this week and stresses the
Soviet Union's need to modernize all aspects of society.
   It speaks of elections for some posts, of reducing some
adminstrative powers of Communist Party, of limiting the terms of
office and of democratic reforms.
   While the proposal makes no concessions to demands for a
multi-party system, it says social organizations that are not
limited to Communist Party members should have ``a bigger say in
the political process in future.''
   The nation's laws will be reviewed, the document says, and ``We
must firmly adhere to the following principle: Everything is
permissible unless prohibited by the law.''
   Gorbachev has stressed reforms of the judicial and political
system as crucial to ending the vestiges of Stalin's dictatorship.
But even if the Communist Party conference approves all the
changes, their implementation may be slowed by resistance in some
quarters.
   Changes envisaged in the political system include a limit of two
five-year terms for for party and government officials all the way
up to the policy-setting Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet,
the nation's parliament. The party also is ordered to keep hands
off day-to-day management of the economy and government, and
concentrate on setting goals.
   Almost all the proposed changes, called the ``theses'' for the
party conference opening June 28, had been raised before by
Gorbachev or his followers.
   But in an apparent victory for Gorbachev, the principle of
secret ballot elections for some posts was adopted.
   The party leader also appears to have gained a chance to sweep
opponents from positions of influence. The conference will consider
calling for a review of all the party's 19 million members.
   The review is likely to focus on the clear struggle between
orthodox Communists used to the authoritarian party system set up
by Stalin and reformers who want to see Gorbachev's reforms succeed.
   The theses contained strong criticism of what it said was the
abuse of power under the system built up by Stalin, and of the
political and economic stagnation that set in under Leonid I.
Brezhnev, who was in power from 1964 to 1982.
   It declared the Soviet Union was ``on the brink of an economic
crisis'' after Brezhnev.
   Although progress has been made, the program said the economy
still is far from the modern financial and monetary system
Gorbachev wants.
   An economist close to Gorbachev, Abel Aganbegyan, told reporters
Friday that despite three years of reform efforts, most average
Soviets have seen no improvement in their lives.
   He said a reform of prices, which is promised for the early
1990s, is essential.
   Nikolai Shmelev, an economist known for his controversial
proposals, said the Soviet economy suffers from gross inefficiency.
It has a shortage of 20 million workers in some sectors, but 25
million extra workers in other sectors, he said.
   In apparent deference to growing grumbling among consumer about
shortages, the theses also stressed that supplies of food and
consumer goods must be sharply increased.
   Scientists and educators were castigated for not doing enough to
introduce new technology and new thinking, but the biggest
criticism was reserved for managers and bureaucrats who still want
to boss others around.
   The only sector of the population praised for its contribution
to the reform effort was the intelligentsia, who have proved the
most vocal supporters of Gorbachev's reforms.
   That reflects in part changes that have given Soviets more
interesting newspapers, livelier television programs and some
previously banned films, books and music.
   If the document is accepted by the 5,000 delegates to the
Communist Party conference, it will mark an important consolidation
of reforms to date for Gorbachev and give him the basis to go
further in transforming the Stalinist system he inherited.

   Here are the main points of Central Committee
proposals published in Friday's Soviet newspapers:
   _On political pluralism. The paper says ``a salient feature of
our time is the appearance of a real pluralism of opinions, open
comparison of ideas and interests.'' It does not envisage
abandonment of the one-party system, but suggests that some social
organizations outside the party should have a bigger say in the
political process in future
   _Local and regional legislatures and the national Parliament are
to play an enhanced role in political debate and to operate under
legal guarantees that their decisions will not be undone by
bureaucratic interference.
   _The legal system is to be strengthened, presuming the innocence
of those on trial and radically reforming the operation of state
prosecutors. Soviet laws are to be rewritten and the principle
adopted that ``everything is permissible unless prohibited by the
law.''
   _Reforms should allow for the exercise of constitutional
freedoms _ freedom of press, conscience, assembly, street
demonstrations and ``firmer guarantees of personal rights, such as
the inviolability of the person and the home, and privacy of
correspondence and telephone conversations, to name but a few.''
   _Party and government officials should be limited to two
five-year terms in office, with third terms permissible only by
majority vote in secret ballot of party and government offices
concerned. The proposals say this practice should extend all the
way to the Central Committee and to the Supreme Soviet, or national
parliament.
   _Due attention should be paid to ethnic relations, and political
institutions formed to articulate ethnic interests made ``more
active.''
   _The party should be reformed to prevent a repeat of the abuses
of power developed under Stalin and ``those who in the past fell
victim to unjustified political accusations and illegality'' should
be rehabilitated.

<HEAD>Top Meese Aide Joins Exodus, Says It `Unrelated' to Meese's Legal
Woes</HEAD>

   Charles Cooper, a top aide to Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, handed in his resignation Friday, but said his
decision to join the exodus of officials from the Justice
Department was ``wholly unrelated'' to Meese's legal troubles.
   Cooper, the assistant attorney general who heads the office of
legal counsel, said he is ``just now beginning'' to look for work
with a private law firm. But he said his decision to leave was not
based on the fact that independent counsel James C. McKay is
expected to issue a report in several weeks raising questions about
Meese's ethical conduct.
   Cooper, whose resignation is effective July 8, praised Meese as
being ``almost exclusively responsible'' for advancing a number of
issues on the Reagan administration's conservative agenda by
focusing debate on interpreting the Constitution and the principles
of federalism and non-discrimination.
   In an interview, Cooper said he has ``an extraordinary
admiration'' for Meese's ``ability to withstand the controversy
that prevails at this time'' in connection with McKay's year-old
criminal invesgtigation of Meese.
   Cooper said ``I have not formed any judgments'' about Meese on
the matters McKay has been examining.
   Meese thanked Cooper in a letter for his ``loyalty, support and
special vote of confidence.''
   The independent counsel launched an investigation on May 11,
1987, that has focused on Meese's ties to scandal-plagued Wedtech
Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   Cooper acknowledged he had doubts briefly about remaining at the
department two months ago when the No. 2 department official,
Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, and criminal division chief
William Weld resigned in protest over Meese's continued tenure as
attorney general.
   Cooper said he at first thought Burns and Weld might know
something about the ``circumstances surrounding Ed,'' such as a
possible determination by McKay that Meese had engaged in
wrongdoing. But three days after Burns and Weld resigned, McKay
announced he had insufficient evidence at that time to seek an
indictment of Meese.
   In a letter to Meese, Cooper said he long ago decided to leave
this summer and that ``I am carrying through with plans formed in a
calmer time and based on a host of personal and professional
considerations wholly unrelated to the controversy of today.''
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said that in terms
of staffing, the department ``is in better shape than most agencies
around town at this point in an administration,'' with many
officials returning to jobs in the private sector as the Reagan
administration comes to an end.
   Korten said the department ``fully expects'' to have a
replacement for Cooper by the time he leaves.
   Cooper, 36, took the legal counsel post in November 1985 after
serving as deputy assistant attorney general in the department's
civil rights division, where he worked closely with William
Bradford Reynolds.
   Cooper played a leading role in trying to win a Supreme Court
seat for federal Judge Robert H. Bork last year. But the Senate
rejected Bork, a vocal conservative, by a wide margin.
   Cooper recently traveled to Panama to participate in
negotiations to try to remove Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from power. He also was among a handful of political
advisers chosen by Meese to conduct a weekend inquiry in November
1986 into the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   The inquiry uncovered the diversion of some of the arms sale
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, triggering the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   There has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections
of the Justice Department in the past two months. Five of Burns'
deputies left following his resignation, virtually emptying the
deputy's office, and two of Weld's aides quit when he did.
   Last week, Meese's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, said the
attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously
enough. The head of Meese's speechwriting unit resigned within
hours of Eastland's disclosure.
   It took Meese nearly two months to find replacements for the
posts vacated by Burns and Weld. Burns' successor, Utah trial
lawyer Harold Christensen, will fill the slot on an acting basis,
pending completion of the Senate confirmation process. Weld's
replacement, Edwards S.G. Dennis Jr., the U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia, also will serve on an acting basis.

<TEXT>
   A child whose fire-and-brimstone preaching
has disrupted his school was suspended for a fifth time Friday as
parents gave his father a petition asking him to stop the boy and
his two younger children from preaching at school.
   The petition was signed by 474 parents and opponents of the
street preaching by the Strode children _ Duffey, 10, Pepper, 6,
and Matthew, 5.
   On Friday, Duffey again ignored requests from Eastfield
Elementary School Assistant Principal Shirley Ramsey to come into
school and begin class. He was suspended for six days, until summer
break begins.
   Pepper and Matthew are to return to school Thursday.
   A group led by parent Lisa Mahan asked permission to present the
petition to the boy's father, street preacher David Strode, while
he and Duffey were receiving Duffey's latest suspension papers. But
school officials asked the group to make the presentation off
school grounds.
   The elder Strode told the group they didn't know the gospel and
were going hell. The parents responded that they do know the gospel
and asked Strode to stop the preaching by his children.
   ``Something bad is going to happen to them,'' said Frances
McPeters, one of the parents. ``I have no mercy on them. I don't
care what happens to them.''
   Mrs. McPeters said the Strode children don't understand what
they're saying, but that they only repeat what they have been told
at home.
   ``Sometimes they'll hold up their Bibles and holler `the Bible
says' and then forget what they're suppose to say,'' she said.
``They're not preachers, they're children.''
   Strode said Friday that the family would be moving before school
began in the fall and the children would enroll in West Marion
Elementary, which is in a different district.
   But Mrs. Ramsey said she did not think the controversy would end
because that school district has the same policy requiring students
to enter the building at 7:30 a.m.
   School officials have repeatedly said the children are being
suspended for violating that policy, not because they preach.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses To Indict Officers In Shooting Of Man With Toy
Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury refused to indict two police
officers accused of shooting a former mental patient who had a toy
pistol, but the officers and the toy manufacturer face a $25
million lawsuit.
   Police overreacted and the gun looked too real, claims the
lawsuit filed by the victim, Gerard A. Mathieu, 36. City officials
also are defendants in the lawsuit.
   Mathieu was paralyzed from the waist down by a police gunshot
that cut his spinal cord on May 16, the suit said.
   An Orleans Parish grand jury Thursday found ``no evidence of
wrongdoing'' and refused to indict the involved officers, whom
police have not publicly identified.
   The shooting happened after police responded to a report that
someone was looking into the windows of a nursing home. The
officers came upon Mathieu sleeping under a tree near the home's
parking lot.
   ``As the police officers approached the sleeping Mr. Mathieu, a
neighbor yelled, `Don't shoot him, he hasn't got any sense!' The
police officers then yelled at the sleeping Mr. Mathieu and he
jumped up with his hands up in the air,'' the suit said. Police
said on the day of the shooting that Mathieu pointed a gun at
officers, but the suit does not address that issue.
   ``The police officers then hit the ground and opened fire on Mr.
Mathieu,'' the suit says, adding that the officers kept firing
after Mathieu hit the ground, hitting him 11 times.
   The suit, filed by attorney Bill Quigley, said the toy pistol
was designed to look real.
   ``The merchandising, advertising and selling of the plastic toy
gun is based in large part on the work done by the Imperial Toy
Corp. in making the full scale model of the 9mm automatic pistol
look like a real gun,'' Quigley says in the suit.
   In Los Angeles, a vice president of Imperial disclaimed any
liability. ``When the toy is used as a toy, there has never been a
problem, and no problem is even foreseeable,'' said Jordan Kort.
   The suit also alleges the policemen, named in the suit as John
Doe and Ron Doe, acted too hastily and shouldn't have shot Mathieu
11 times even if they felt threatened.
   The city public affairs office refused comment on the suit.

   NBC won the May sweeps by the highest margin for
a May sweeps ever and by the second-highest margin for any sweeps,
according to figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. released by the
network.
   There are four sweeps months a year during which local ratings
are measured for use in negotiating advertising rates. The networks
generally load schedules with special programming designed to help
their affiliates.
   The May sweeps ratings showed an increase in network audience
since May sweeps of last year, and a change in the trend shown by
end-of-season ratings last month of a decline in network viewership
this season compared to 1986-87.
   NBC won the sweeps with an average, prime-time rating of 14.9
and a 26 share. CBS was second with a 12.0 and 21, and ABC third
with an 11.7 and 20 share. It was NBC's 12th sweeps win in a row.
   The last time any network won by a larger margin was when ABC
won in July 1984, according to NBC.
   The networks had a total rating of 37.9 in May of 1987. In May
of this year, their total was 38.6.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   The highest-rated show of the May sweeps was the two-hour
``Magnum, P.I.'' finale on CBS. It had a 32.0 rating and 48 share.
In second was NBC's movie, ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Lady in
the Lake,'' with a 22.6 rating and 35 share.
   The highest-rated series was ``A Different World'' on NBC, with
a 22.0 rating and 38 share, barely ahead of ``The Cosby Show,''
which had a 21.9 rating and 40 share.
   The larger share for ``Cosby'' indicates fewer sets in use at
the earlier time period.
   The highest-rated miniseries was NBC's ``Something Is Out
There,'' with a 19.2 and 30 share. ABC's ``The Bourne Identity''
was second with 18.5 and 30.
   Though miniseries are shorter and fewer, their ratings show them
to be ``still a viable programming source,'' said NBC analyst
Gerald Jaffe. ``You just have to be careful which ones you make and
when you schedule them.''

   The Afghan government has pardoned a
French photographer jailed after he was convicted of spying,
state-owned radio announced Friday.
   A French diplomat said the Frenchman would be released within
two or three days.
   Western sources said they expected an Italian journalist also to
be released soon. The two are the only foreigners known to be held
in Aghanistan.
   Radio Kabul quoted Afghan President Najib as announcing the
pardon of French photographer Alain Guillo. The decision was taken
in view of ``the old friendship between France and Afghanistan,''
the president was quoted as saying in the report monitored in
Islamabad.
   He said the move was made in light of an accord signed last
month to withdraw Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Najib has made
increased efforts to polish his international image since then.
   The radio broadcast said Najib made the announcement after
Gilbert Perol, secretary-general of the French External Affairs
Ministry, visited Najib in Kabul. He delivered a personal message
from French President Francois Mitterrand, according to the radio
station.
   Guillo was detained while filming the civil war in northern
Afghanistan and sentenced to 10 years in prison in September.
   In Paris, his girlfriend, Jeanne Lesieur, told The Associated
Press that she had been informed by the French Foreign Ministry
that the journalist would be released Saturday morning. She said
she did not know when he would return to Paris.
   Eric Fornier, spokesman for the French Embassy in Islamabad,
said Friday that Guillo would be freed ``in the next two to three
days.'' He said details of the release were still being worked out.
   Guillo has shared a prison cell in Kabul with Italian journalist
Fausto Biloslavo, who was serving a similar sentence.
   There was no official word Friday on whether the Italian would
be released. However, Western diplomatic sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they also expected Biloslavo's freedom
soon.

   A fund-raising effort to pay for a life-saving
operation for Reno's top-ranked police dog was called off almost as
soon as it started Friday because of the overwhelming response,
Sgt. Greg Dion said.
   Dion said police stopped accepting contributions at 8 a.m.
because the $1,000 raised was more than the $600 needed to rid Zeus
of a cancerous tumor in his eye.
   Residents learned about Zeus' troubles through a newspaper
article Friday and from radio stations.
   ``We want to thank the public for their generous offers, but the
phone's burning up down here and we've got more money than we know
what to do with,'' Dion said.
   Officer Mike Kendig said the city would not pay for 7-year-old
Zeus' operation.
   Zeus is credited with 11 felony arrests and gained the nickname
``land shark'' because he once pulled a prowler out of some bushes.
   Zeus, who veterinarians said is not suffering pain, will retire
in July. Kendig, the dog's working companion, plans to adopt the
German shepherd.

<TEXT>
   A new system has been hooked up to restore
service to half of Illinois Bell's 35,000 west suburban customers
whose telephones have been faulty since Mother's Day, but some said
Friday that phone trouble persists.
   ``Mine doesn't work,'' said Erva Wilson, a Hinsdale homeowner
who was borrowing a neighbor's phone to try to get some answers
about her telephone service problems.
   ``My son tried to make a long-distance call to Iowa and he
couldn't, so we're still having problems here,'' said Raymond
Zimner, also of Hinsdale.
   Ms. Wilson and Zimner are two of the thousands of customers
whose lines were reconnected to a state-of-the-art digital
switching system at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, 2{ weeks after a fire
ravaged the Hinsdale switching station.
   Since the blaze, thousands of customers have had periodic
trouble completing calls to local numbers and have not been able to
place calls outside their area code.
   Though half were reconnected late Thursday, others will continue
to have spotty local service and trouble calling long distance
until ``sometime in the beginning of June,'' when they're connected
to the digital system, said Illinois Bell spokeswoman Laura Littel.
   Ms. Littel said the company has received some complaints from
reconnected customers Friday, but that problems with the new system
should be ``isolated'' and can be fixed quickly.
   ``If they call today with trouble, it will be cleared up very
soon after they call. It's just a matter of tweaking the system and
finding out where the bug is,'' she said Friday.
   ``When you put a machine like this into action, usually we have
weeks and weeks of testing to make sure it's running perfect and
smooth. But because this was an emergency situation, we rushed the
job,'' Ms. Littel said.
   ``We did things in reverse order: We did a little testing,
turned the machine on, and now we're dealing with the trouble,''
she said.
   Zimner, who owns a delivery and messenger service, said, ``My
business had been down (since the fire) because I couldn't
communicate with my clients.''
   Ms. Wilson, a retiree, said she was ``pretty disappointed'' when
she picked up the phone Friday morning, and there was no dial tone.
   ``I'm much inconvenienced. I live by myself, so it's a bit of a
concern,'' she said.
   ``I knew that they were supposed to switch over to a new
machine, so I thought today everybody's phone was going to be OK _
but mine isn't,'' Ms. Wilson said.
   Also Friday, Gov. James R. Thompson said that Illinois Bell has
indicated a willingness to assist local governments recover from
the telephone crisis.
   The plan ``would probably include grants, purchase of emergency
preparedness equipment or some other form of assistance,'' Thompson
said.
   Thompson also said the Office of the State Fire Marshal is
investigating the fire. If it is determined that the blaze was
linked to an electrical storm that hit the area, businesses and
local governments could possibly become eligible for federal aid.

<HEAD>Negotiator Says Peasants, Housewives Occupying Embassy</HEAD>

   A government negotiator said Friday that
masked invaders occupying the Mexican Embassy were not leftist
guerrillas as a radio network reported, but workers, peasants,
students and housewives.
   Another government spokesman said two leftist political parties
agreed Friday to end a huge rural protest by peasants.
   A Defense Ministry communique said 16 people had been killed and
30 wounded in the past week in a guerrilla attack and several
clashes between militant peasants and government security forces.
   The radio network Caracol reported soon after protesters rushed
into the Mexican Embassy on Thursday that leftist guerrillas had
taken it over.
   Omar Velazco, an assistant attorney general, met with
representatives of the protesters for eight hours Friday and gave a
different description of them to reporters.
   He said he was hopeful the sit-in would end peacefully.
   Sit-ins at embassies and consulates in Bogota are fairly common
and seldom have anything to do with the country involved. The
demands of this group include water for slum areas, which are being
supplied only once a week during Bogota's worst drought in 53 years.
   A dozen sit-ins have occurred in the past four years, including
two others at the Mexican Embassy. All have ended with no one being
hurt.
   Dozens of soldiers surrounded the two-story building in a
residential area of northern Bogota. No guns were seen among the
protesters, who appeared frequently at windows.
   Mexican diplomats and Colombian employees entered and left the
building undisturbed. Spectators, including journalists, were kept
a block away.
   About 40 people occupied the building. In addition to water for
the slums, they want an investigation of allegations by leftist
parties that the army sponsors death squads that have killed more
than 800 leftists in three years.
   The military denies the allegation.
   Peasants who started marching on half a dozen towns last Monday
also demand an investigation of the death squads.
   Only three marches continued Thursday _ in the northern states
of Santander, North Santander and Cesar. Fernando Brito, assistant
minister of government, said Friday the leftist political parties
Patriotic Union and People's Front had agreed to end them.
   He said the promise was made after government negotiators
listened to peasant complaints. In addition to allegations about
death squads, the peasants have said they want more effective land
reform and nationalization of foreign oil companies.
   According to the Defense Ministry, those killed in the past week
included four policemen ambushed by guerrillas near Medellin,
headquarters of the illegal cocaine traffic.
   The others were peasants killed when police, claiming they were
fired on, shot into crowds of marchers, the ministry said.
   A military alert was declared Thursday because of the violence.
   Former President Misael Pastrana, the opposition leader, urged
President President Virgilio Barco to return from abroad.
   Pastrana said in a broadcast address Thursday that the ``country
is in flames.''
   Barco said in Lisbon, Portugal: ``The situation in Colombia is
totally normal, in Bogota and the rest of the country. ... I don't
see any reason to abandon the trip. We have experienced situations
such as these in Colombia for 30 years.''
   He said opposition demands for his return were part of a
``psychological war aimed at damaging a very important trip.''
   After three days in Portugal, Barco will visit the Vatican for
an audience with Pope John Paul II and then go to Washington.

<HEAD>Bush: `I'm The Underdog And I Like It'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

   Vice President George Bush declared
Friday ``I'm the underdog and I like it'' and said his weak showing
against Democrat Michael Dukakis in recent public opinion polls is
not a liability.
   Bush told reporters at his oceanside retreat that the polls spur
him to wage a more aggressive general election campaign. He cited
his comeback to clinch the Republican presidential nomination after
losing in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.
   The vice president also urged a renewal in collapsed
negotiations to persuade Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega to leave
power, although he earlier opposed those talks.
   ``If we can find some way to get him out and still bring him to
justice, that would suit me just fine,'' Bush said, adding that he
would prefer to bring other Western Hemisphere leaders into the
negotiating process.
   At the same time, Bush characterized as ``an outrageous lie''
what he said was a reported suggestion that the Reagan
administration had initiated the talks to help his campaign.
   ``When you read these outrageous charges by a drug-related,
indicted dictator, discount them. They are total lies.''
   ``And I don't like it being injected by Michael Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson either. If they have some proof, or they have
something other than nuance and insinuation, let them speak out.''
   With the Atlantic surf pounding behind him, Bush told reporters
on the lawn of his family retreat that recent polls, including a
new Washington Post-ABC poll showing him trailing Dukakis by 13
points, were helping to generate his competitive juices.
   ``I'm the underdog and I like it,'' Bush said. ``It is May and
the election is in November. Do I worry about it? I don't worry
about it. I like fighting back. (Dukakis) is the front-runner. He's
been decreed that in poll after poll. And I like fighting back. I
remember Iowa.''
   Bush has scheduled meetings here over the next week with
advisers and prominent Republicans in an effort to get his campaign
back on track.
   Among those he met with on Friday were Govs. John McKernan of
Maine, John Sununu of New Hampshire, James Thompson of Illinois,
former housing secretary Carla Hills, former deputy Treasury
Secretary Richard Darman, and Martin Anderson, former domestic
policy adviser to President Reagan.
   Bush conceded that polls showing he far lags behind Dukakis
among women voters were of particular concern.
   ``What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on
certain women's issues. One of them will be day care,'' he said.
   Bush attributed some of his upbeat attitude to his surroundings.
   ``It's the Maine air,'' he said. ``When I get up here I feel _
it's not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed about it. I don't
feel troubled by somebody pointing out I'm behind in the polls. ...
I'm coming out of 10 points down in these polls and I've got five
months to fight back.''
   ``There's a little bit of a cholesterol rise, the frustration
level going up, in terms of sitting around and listening to (Jesse)
Jackson and Michael Dukakis dump all over me and the
administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more combative.''
   Bush also scoffed at polls that suggested Americans view Michael
Dukakis as more conservative than he.
   ``That, by any stretch of the imagination, is hard to believe,''
he said.
   ``In terms of neighborhood values _ anticrime, pledge of
allegiance (in schools), penalties for those who are really
corrupting these neighborhoods _ he is on the far left side of
things. I don't think that blue-collar America, or ethnic America,
wants to move away from the kinds of values I've been talking
about.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Two Top Spies Want To Return from East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper said Friday that two of
West Germany's best-known traitors, Guenter Guillaume and
Hans-Joachim Tiedge, want to return from East Germany. The
government discounted the report.
   Officials denied the two men had been in contact with Bonn
authorities, as the mass-circulation newspaper Bild reported. ``We
have no knowledge'' that the spies want to return, government
spokesman Herbert Schmuelling told reporters.
   Bild also said that, as former top officials, Tiedge and
Guillaume would be eligible for more than 4,000 marks ($2,300) a
month each in pensions if they returned. Schmuelling said: ``That
is something I am not able to confirm.''
   Ludger Reuber, spokesman for the Employment Ministry, said a law
is being drafted that would prohibit convicted spies from receiving
government pensions.
   Guillaume was unmasked in 1974 while serving as a close aide to
Willy Brandt, who then resigned as chancellor. Guillaume was
sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1975 and was traded to the East
in a spy swap six years later.
   Tiedge was a top official of the main counter-espionage agency
when he disappeared in June 1985. He turned up later in East
Germany.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is showing a new flexibility
on such Middle East issues as a Palestinian state and Israel's
refusal to negotiate with the PLO, a Foreign Ministry official said
Friday.
   In a separate development, Soviet officials have agreed to
collaborate with an Israeli rabbi and Western scholars on a project
to research Soviet collections of Jewish historical materials.
   A Soviet delegation outlined the new position during secret
talks in Madrid this month with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, said
the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   ``If what they have hinted at is indeed their official position
... then the gaps between us seem bridgeable,'' the official said.
   He said the Soviets no longer insist that an independent
Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories be a required
result of an international conference on the Middle East.
   ``The way they phrase it, it is up to the Palestinians to decide
who they want to be confederated with,'' he said.
   Moscow also showed flexibility about the Palestine Liberation
Organization, he said. Israel calls the PLO a terrorist group and
refuses to negotiate with it.
   According to the official, the Soviets want the PLO invited to
an international conference but said the invitation should carry a
condition that all participants accept U.N. resolutions recognizing
Israel's right to exist.
   ``We see a very clear distinction between the Soviet attitude to
the PLO and to Syria, for example,'' he said. ``Syria is a very
important asset, the PLO less so. They will not sell the PLO down
the river easily, but they feel what they have to do to protect the
PLO is less.''
   The Soviet position paper was prepared by Alexander Zotov, the
Communist Party Central Committee's deputy director for the Middle
East, the official said, adding that Peres met with a Soviet
delegation first in Madrid, during a a Socialist International
conference, and then in Washington and Geneva.
   Chaim Billat of the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications,
directed by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, announced the research project
Thursday. He also said the Steinsaltz would be allowed to open an
institute in the Soviet Union to train Jewish scholars.
   ``We consider this as a major breakthrough, and what is
important is that it was the Soviet initiative,'' Billat said.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic ties with Israel after the
1967 Middle East war, but the Foreign Ministry said agreement has
been reached for an Israeli consular delegation to be sent there
for the first time since the break.
   A Foreign Ministry official said the ministry was not aware of
the research project but welcomed it as a ``positive development.''

<HEAD>White Apartheid Opponent Concludes Talks With ANC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN FISCHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of South Africa's best-known
white apartheid opponents met Friday with representatives of an
outlawed black guerrilla movement but said the two sides formed no
concrete agreements about reforming their country.
   Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, former head of the Progressive
Federal Party, met with four national executive committee members
of the African National Congress, including information and
publicity head Thabo Mbeki.
   Among the topics discussed was the ANC's use of violence to
bring about reform in South Africa. The two sides met in a
Frankfurt hotel.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing and sabotage
campaign to oust South Africa's white-led government.
   ``No resolutions were adopted, and no decisions were taken''
with the ANC on that issue, Slabbert said, but he said the
discussions were ``frank and open.''
   ``I certainly do not condone bomb attacks or violence or tactics
of terror of any kind,'' he added.
   Slabbert said the two sides discussed a broad range of issues.
   ``This would be a totally impossible situation in South Africa,
that you can have this kind of discussion,'' he said. ``The image
of the ANC amongst whites has been demonized ... by the state and
its propaganda.''
   Slabbert, director of an anti-apartheid think tank, said he
hoped such discussions with the ANC and other groups would help
start a process of dialogue and debate.
   ``We would be happy to facilitate further discussions of this
kind,'' Slabbert said, speaking on behalf of his organization, the
Institute for a Democratic Alternative.
   Slabbert said he was finished with his current round of talks
with the ANC and that he would fly to Vancouver on Saturday for
other business.
   The four ANC delegates met Thursday with an eight-member
delegation headed by Wynand Malan, a parliamentary member and head
of the anti-apartheid National Democratic Movement.
   As they met, two bombs exploded in Pretoria and injured four
people. South Africa's law and order minister blamed the ANC for
the blasts.
   Five delegates from the National Democratic Movement attended
Friday's meeting between the ANC and Slabbert as observers,
movement delegate Harald Pakendorf told reporters.
   Slabbert resigned from Parliament in 1986, saying the body had
become irrelevant and incapable of solving South Africa's racial
problems.
   Last July, Slabbert led a group of about 50 South African whites
for three days of talks with the ANC in Dakar, Senegal.
   Those talks were widely condemned by the South African
government and right-wing groups, who portray the ANC as a
terrorist organization and oppose all contacts with the group.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Officials in this northern port city may
allow the Syrian freighter Zanoobia to unload about 2,200 tons of
chemical waste the ship has been trying to dump in various harbors
around the world.
   ``Genoa is the only Italian port which can safely handle
unloading and disposal of the chemicals,'' said Giuseppe Francese,
the port commissioner.
   He added, however, that the authorities must give final approval
to unload the 12,000 drums of unidentified toxic waste, which
belong to Italian industries. The waste, once unloaded, would be
burned.
   The drums were returned to Italy after 13 months of efforts to
deposit them elsewhere, including in Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria and
Greece.
   The Zanoobia is anchored off the Tuscan port of Marina di
Carrara.

   An Alitalia jumbo jet carrying 398
passengers from New York to Milan made an emergency landing Friday
in western France after a caller said a bomb had been placed aboard
the plane, police said.
   No explosives were found during a search of the aircraft.
   Eight passengers were slightly injured in the evacuation of the
Boeing 747, said Alitalia officials in Nantes who spoke on
condition of anonymity. All passengers left for Milan later in the
day on another plane, police said.
   Cabin chief Enrico Hazan, one of 20 crew members, said Alitalia
officials in Milan received a phone call at 8:05 a.m. saying a bomb
would explode in 25 minutes.
   Within 20 minutes, Italian police had contacted French
authorities who instructed the plane to land at the
Nantes-Chateau-Bougon airport in Brittany, police said.
   The plane landed and was searched by security personnel.

<HEAD>Pope Urges `Only Peaceful Means' To Fight Apartheid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday urged Christians
in South Africa to reject violence in fighting apartheid, which he
said had exacted a ``terrible toll.''
   ``I pray that the Christian communities in South Africa will
continue to foster only peaceful means of responding to the
difficulties of the present situation,'' the pope said in remarks
to a visiting delegation of South African churchmen, including
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   The pope restated his and the Roman Catholic Church's opposition
to all forms of racial discrimination, adding that a change in the
structures of discrimination requires ``a change of hearts.''
   The 10-member delegation was a joint group of the South African
Council of Churches and the Southern African Catholic Bishops'
Conference.
   In their address to the pope, the church officials said recent
government actions in South Africa have ``resulted in bitterness,
resentment and frustration _ feelings which can easily lead to
violence.''
   They said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held in
Johannesburg on May 30.
   ``The emergency convocation will develop effective non-violent
action to put pressure on the South African government to sit at
the negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaborate
with the unjust system,'' the delegation said in a news statement.
   At a news conference, Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the
pope was making an ``eloquent statement'' by not visiting South
Africa during his tour of four African nations next September.
   ``It speaks to the perpetrators of apartheid, it speaks to the
victims,'' he said.
   Tutu called for tougher sanctions by Western nations against the
South African government.
   ``If we do not apply sanctions, or if sanctions are ineffective,
what is effective?,'' he said. ``If you say sanctions will fail or
have failed, than you can tell us what will succeed...then the very
last last option available is violence and we have consistently
expressed our opposition to violence... So we say, `help us.' ''
   He criticized Japan for its trade links with South Africa.
   ``We hope that the Japanese would be embarassed that they have
stepped into a vacuum,'' he said. ``I hope the Japanese will
remember that they were insulted in South Africa when the
government was enforcing racial classification. Because they wanted
the Japanese as traders, they called them `honorary Europeans.' I
would hope they would get so upset, they would go back home.''

   The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a
treaty eliminating U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles, ratifying the first major arms pact between the two
superpowers in 16 years.
   The final vote was 93-5. Ratification requires the approval of
two-thirds of the members present and voting.
   Approval of the treaty came in time for it to be presented to
President Reagan at his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, which begins Sunday in Moscow.
   It also gave cause for optimism to those who see the relatively
modest INF accord as paving the way for a more ambitious treaty
making deep cuts in the two sides' arsenals of long-range nuclear
missiles.
   ``We are making a breakthrough,'' said Senate Majority Whip Alan
Cranston, D-Calif. ``It is not a substantively significant
treaty.... But it lays the foundation'' for future treaties ``that
can substantially reduce the scale, cost and dangers of this arms
race.''
   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat Ernest Hollings
of South Carolina.
   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did not vote.
   The pact was the first U.S.-Soviet weapons treaty to be approved
since the 1972 accord on Anti-Ballistic Missiles.
   White House officials in Washington issued a statement from the
president following the vote, in which Reagan said: ``I am very
pleased with the action of the United States Senate in consenting
to ratification of the INF treaty. In two days I will arrive in the
Soviet Union to meet with General Secretary Gorbachev to discuss
our four-part agenda. Today's action by the Senate clearly shows
support for our arms reduction objectives.''
   As it moved toward approval, the Senate adopted strong language
governing future interpretations of the medium-range missile
treaty, and turned aside a series of Republican amendments that
would have undermined that provision.
   ``I think we've closed all the loopholes we know about in this
treaty, and it's a much better treaty than when it was sent'' to
Congress, said Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Thursday's session had ended on a testy partisan note, with Byrd
threatening to let the treaty languish if Republicans continued to
seek what he saw as debilitating amendments.
   Approval of the treaty was considered certain because it
requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate, or 67 votes, and as many
as 90 senators have expressed support for it. But the possibility
of delay remained alive.
   Byrd warned GOP senators that they risked embarrassing their own
president by failing to deliver the approved treaty in time for the
Sunday start of the summit.
   ``This is no empty threat,'' Byrd admonished senators. ``If
we're going to continue to have Mickey Mouse amendments like this,
the president is not going to have his treaty before he leaves the
summit.''
   Byrd and GOP leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., informed Reagan of the
decision during a telephone call to Helsinki moments after the
vote. The two leaders accepted Reagan's invitation to come to
Moscow next Tuesday and bring the ratification documents with them.
   One amendment, an attempt by Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., to
make any Soviet violation grounds for U.S. withdrawal from the
treaty, was defeated on a vote of 66-30. And a move by Sen. Larry
Pressler, R-S.D., to require Reagan to certify at the summit
whether the Soviets are living up to their human rights
obligations, also was defeated, 86-10.
   On Thursday, Byrd had won overwhelming bipartisan passage of an
amendment stipulating that the White House will be bound in the
future by the interpretation of the treaty as expressed by
administration officials during congressional hearings.
   Any effort to change that interpretation would have to be
approved again by the Senate before becoming valid, said the
amendment, which passed on a vote of 72-27.
   ``The Senate has clearly made visible that it is an equal
partner with any president in the making of treaties,'' Byrd said
after the provision was adopted, ``and I hope that will be a
sobering impact on this president and on Mr. Gorbachev when they
sit down and discuss another agreement'' on limiting long-range
nuclear weapons.
   The provision grew out of a dispute with the Reagan
administration over White House efforts to redefine the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Soviets to allow greater
latitude for testing of Reagan's Star Wars missile defense program.
   But a few hours after the vote on the Byrd amendment, Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., came close to undermining the provision by
proposing a change stipulating that the United States could not be
bound by any interpretation of the treaty ``that is not equally
binding on the Soviet Union.''
   Wilson's proposal was killed, 53-45, and an angry Byrd sent the
Senate home for the night. The vote was virtually a party-line
division.
   Two similar attempts by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., were defeated
today by wider margins.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by Reagan
and Gorbachev in Washington on Dec. 8, requires the elimination
within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range of 300
miles to 3,400 miles, and would result in the destruction of 867
U.S. missiles in Europe and 1,752 Soviet missiles.
   While those numbers represent a relatively small slice of each
side's total nuclear arsenal, the pact is regarded as particularly
important because it breaks a long drought in arms-control
agreements between the two sides and sets the stage for progress on
a much larger goal: massive cuts in each side's long-range nuclear
missile fleet.
   It was also important because it would be the first treaty to
actually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simply
slowing growth in their numbers. And its far-reaching verification
provisions include the first on-site inspections allowed by either
superpower.

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Address Women's Issues; Dukakis Says His Record
Clear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, conceding that women's negative views
are hurting him in the polls, promised Friday he would spell out
``what I feel on certain women's issues.'' Democrat Michael Dukakis
said his own positions are evident from his record on pay equity,
child care and affirmative action.
   Bush said his ``gender gap'' problem _ the difficulty he and
some other Republicans have had in drawing votes from women _ would
be discussed during the coming week of meetings with GOP governors
and other party officials at his Kennebunkport, Maine, retreat.
   Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner, continued to blast the
Reagan administration for its dealings with Panamanian military
leader Manuel Noriega, talking of alleged $200,000 payments by the
CIA as well as the failed negotiations to get him out of power.
   ``We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the
United States,'' Dukakis said Friday in Albuquerque, N.M.. ``You
can't be serious about waging a real war against drugs when we have
an administration that can't say no to Noriega.''
   The vice president, though saying he has not agreed with some
administration policies dealing with Noriega, said the U.S. goal
remains the same despite the breakdown in talks designed to remove
him from power.
   ``If we can find some way to get him out and bring him to
justice, that would suit me just fine,'' Bush said in a news
conference on the lawn in front of his vacation retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Dukakis, grinding toward a nominating majority expected in ten
days, met briefly with remaining party rival Jesse Jackson at the
Albuquerque airport. The men emerged smiling from the session that
lasted about five minutes. Aides would not discuss the substance of
the meeting.
   Earlier, Jackson reached out to American Indians, saying they
have been ignored by the federal government.
   ``It's not too much to ask for a summit with the American Indian
leadership,'' Jackson told Indian leaders at the All Indian Pueblo
Council. ``Hispanics in the barrios, blacks in the ghettos,
ranchers on ranches, Indians on reservations ... there's a tendency
of these people to be abandoned by law.''
   The Democratic candidates planned Memorial Day weekend
campaigning in New Jersey, which joins New Mexico, California and
Montana in the final round of presidential primaries on June 7.
Dukakis has more than 1,700 of the 2,081 delegate votes he needs to
win the party's nomination, with 466 at stake June 7.
   Bush, spending a week in Maine during the superpower summit in
Moscow, said he is getting recharged for a combative stance as the
underdog against Dukakis in the fall campaign for the White House.
   ``I like fighting back,'' he declared.
   ``It's the Maine air,'' said the GOP nominee-to-be. ``When I get
up here I feel _ it's not feistiness _ but I feel very relaxed
about it. I don't feel troubled by somebody pointing out I'm behind
in the polls. ... I'm coming out of 10 points down in these polls
and I've got five months to fight back.''
   The latest ABC News-Washington Post poll said that Dukakis has a
53-40 margin over Bush among registered voters.
   In the poll, women favored Dukakis 61-33, while Bush led among
men by four percentage points. Other polls have also showed a
gender gap, although not as large as this one.
   ``What I've got to do is more clearly define what I feel on
certain women's issues. One of them will be day care,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis also noted the polls during his appearences in
Albuquerque, where he, too, talked about women's issues.
   ``We Democrats have the best chance to win the presidency in
years and we're going to do it,'' he told the Federation of
Democratic Women. ``I've never seen our party so united. ... I've
never seen our party so together.''
   The Massachusetts governor emphasized the family during that
speech prior to an outdoor rally, saying his record demonstrates
his commitment to affirmative action, pay equity, child care and
welfare reform. He said he and his wife, Kitty, are committed to
strengthening the family, calling it ``the single most important
institution in our nation and our world.''
   Bush said he is angered by constant criticism from Democrats.
   ``We're going to put it a little more in focus,'' Bush said.
``The frustration level (is) going up, in terms of sitting around
and listening to Jackson and Michael Dukakis dump all over me and
the administration. So I'm beginning to get a little more
combative.''
   He denounced what he said were polls saying Americans view
Dukakis as more conservative than he.
   ``That, by any stretch of the imagination, is hard to believe,''
he said. ``In terms of neighborhood values _ anti-crime, pledge of
allegiance, penalties for those who are really corrupting these
neighborhoods _ he is on the far left-side of things.''

   Hundreds of Syrian soldiers wearing
bulletproof vests over combat fatigues moved into the south Beirut
slums Friday, halting a three-week war between rival Shiite Moslem
militias that killed nearly 300 people.
   The intervention, under a Syrian agreement with Iran, is
expected to increase pressure for the release of the 18 foreign
hostages in Lebanon, who include nine Americans.
   Most are believed held in the slums by extremists linked to the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which gained control of
nearly all south Beirut in the battle with the Amal militia that
began May 6.
   Hezbollah and Amal, a mainstream group allied with Syria,
stopped shooting as the soldiers began moving in at 11 a.m.
   A few hours earlier, Syria's four top generals in Lebanon
escaped harm in an ambush in a south Beirut neighborhood controlled
by Hezbollah.
   Dozens of bullets hit the generals' Mercedes, but its armor
plating saved them. ``Otherwise, there would have been no
survivors,'' a police spokesman said.
   As the Shiite guns fell silent, fighting broke out in the Bourj
el-Barajneh Palestinian refugee camp between pro-Syrian guerrillas
and Fatah, the main army of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Police said they had no word on the cause or casualties in the
camp, which is adjacent to the Shiite slums.
   In Washington, the State Department said of the Syrian move:
``We welcome an end to the suffering of the civilian residents of
the southern suburbs. We hope the current arrangement, which
includes a Lebanese police element, can be a first step toward
restoring the central government's authority.''
   About 900 Syrian infantrymen in three groups advanced on foot
into the 16 square miles of tin-roofed huts and cement-block
apartments next to the Beirut airport.
   They carried machine guns and shoulder-fired grenade launchers.
Following the first group of Syrians were 52 Lebanese policemen
with automatic rifles.
   Syrian soldiers set up five checkpoints along a disengagement
line between the Shiyah neighborhood, held by Amal, and the
Hezbollah-controlled Ghobeiri district, where the generals were
ambushed.
   The line stretched through two miles of gutted shops, smoldering
wrecked cars and bullet-scarred cement-block shanties. Broken power
cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards and spent
cartidges.
   Young Hezbollah fighters on the slum's fringes stared intently
at a group of 20 American and British journalists, who traveled
from Damascus with Syrian escorts to cover the deployment.
   ``I feel like a juicy T-bone steak in front of a hungry man,''
one reporter said.
   Checkpoints also were established at key road junctions in the
Hay Moawad and Mesharrafieh neighborhoods, controlled by Hezbollah.
   Wailing women on sidewalks and balconies showered the Syrians
with rose water and rice in a traditional gesture of welcome.
   ``Animals! They are all animals, animals killing animals!'' a
man shouted in English from in front of his shattered house when he
saw Western correspondents covering the Syrian advance.
   He said Hezbollah fighters seized his home from Amal militiamen
in the final phase of the battle, which according to police killed
a total of 296 people and wounded 1,000.
   Hezbollah gained control of 90 percent of the area, which has
long been a refuge for kidnappers, hijackers and assassins.
   Reporters saw two bulldozers clearing mounds of earth and
pushing sandbag barricades from the streets. Syrian specialists
defused land mines and unexploded bombs.
   Half an hour before the deployment began, shell blasts and
bursts of gunfire resounded across Beirut from the Shiite slums.
   Police said they did not know what started the shooting. Both
sides had pledged to observe a ``final cease-fire.''
   Abdul Hadi Hamadi, the Hezbollah security chief in Beirut, said
Hezbollah and Amal were withdrawing their fighters from all south
Beirut neighborhoods and would put them on the line that separates
the capital's Moslem and Christian sectors.
   His brothers, Mohammed Ali and Abbas, are held in West Germany
on terrorist charges. Mohammed Ali is accused of the 1985 TWA
hijacking in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi represents Hezbollah on a four-party committee set up
Friday to supervise the truce.
   When the agreement was announced Thursday, a Syrian official
told The Associated Press privately: ``Ending the fighting will
create new hope for the hostages, and Syria will spare no effort to
secure their release.''
   He said preserving their lives was the first priority, ``then
there can be hope for their release through negotiations.''
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   There was no word on when the Syrians would send tanks and other
armor into the slums, but the second phase of the deployment was to
be completed Saturday.
   An estimated 7,500 Syrian troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored
personnel carriers ringed the slums for 13 days, waiting for orders
to move.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in eastern and northern Lebanon and
about 7,500 patrolling Moslem west Beirut.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria has become Lebanon's main power
broker during 13 years of civil war, but Iran has used Hezbollah to
challenge Syrian influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, the
largest sect in Lebanon.

   Two men on a motorcycle fired at least
six shots Friday at a military prosecutor handling the cases
against leftist guerrillas who tried to kill President Augusto
Pinochet in 1986, police said.
   The prosecutor, army Col. Fernando Torres, was unharmed after
the men fired at his car.
   Torres said the attack was being investigated, ``but as far as I
am concerned, it was just a traffic incident.''
   Torres' bodyguards shot back at the attackers as they fled, said
Santiago police chief Gen. Gabriel Ormeno.
   The attack occurred around noon at a busy intersection in a
fashionable Santiago neighborhood.
   Local radio stations said the attackers also tried to plant a
bomb on top of Torres' car as it stopped at a traffic light. Police
did not confirm the report, and no bomb was found.
   Torres is prosecuting dozens of suspected leftist guerrillas
charged with a number of attacks against government and police
officials. Among them are at least 25 members of a leftist
guerrilla group that claimed responsibility for the unsuccessful
but bloody attempt to kill Pinochet in September 1986.
   Pinochet survived the attack on his motorcade at a mountain road
in the Andes foothills near Santiago, but five of his bodyguards
were killed and 11 wounded.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, underscoring a key
theme for the superpower summit, said Friday reforms championed by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are ``new and good'' but that
the Kremlin still falls short of meeting international standards on
human rights and freedom.
   Two days before his arrival in Moscow, Reagan said, ``Soviet
practice does not _ or does not yet _ measure up to Soviet
commitment'' under the 1975 East-West agreement known as the
Helsinki Final Act.
   The Senate gave Reagan a big pre-summit boost Friday when it
ratified by an overwhelming 93-5 vote the treaty outlawing
medium-range nuclear missiles which the president and Gorbachev
signed at their Washington summit last December.
   Reagan issued a statement saying he was ``very pleased'' with
the Senate vote, which he said ``clearly shows support for our arms
reduction objectives.''
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Minority
Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., who telephoned the president in
Helsinki with the news, accepted Reagan's invitation to fly to
Moscow on Tuesday to witness a ratification ceremony the following
day.
   Reagan made his human rights speech before an invited audience
of about 1,200 people in the austerely-designed marble auditorium
of Finlandia Hall, where the Helsinki accords were signed by 35
nations, including the Soviet Union and United States.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets pledged to provide more liberty
for their people and those in Eastern Europe. And yet, 13 years
later, Reagan said, the cases of divided families and blocked
marriages remain on the East-West agenda, while Russians trying to
emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings.
   ``And what are we to think of the continued suppression of those
who wish to practice their religious beliefs?'' Reagan asked.
   At the same time, he said Gorbachev's twin campaigns of
``glasnost,'' or openness, and ``perestroika,'' the restructuring
of the economy, are ``words that to our ears have a particularly
welcome sound.''
   Thirteen years ago, Reagan and other conservatives had opposed
the U.S. signing of the Helsinki agreement because it implicitly
accepted Eastern European boundaries set after World War II in
Moscow's favor.
   Yet Reagan spoke glowingly of the accords Friday, saying, ``And,
despite the doubts of the critics, for the past 13 years the
signatory states have mustered the political will to keep on
working and making progress.''
   The address, coupled with an official welcoming ceremony earlier
at the presidential palace, marked the only time Reagan ventured
from the seclusion of a government guest house where he is spending
3{ days resting and preparing for the summit.
   In other developments:
   _A Soviet source in Moscow, declining to be named publicly, said
Gorbachev plans to hold a news conference during the summit _ the
first time a Communist Party general secretary will have held such
a session on home territory.
   _Yevgeny Primakov, a Gorbachev adviser, accused the United
States of violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to
Afghanistan's anti-communist Mujahedeen guerrillas.
   _Viktor Karpov, a top Soviet arms control official, called on
the United States to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut
long-range nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of
compromise.
   _The White House said that Reagan intends to raise the issue of
the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia with Gorbachev and said it
hopes reports of a possible troop withdrawal provide impetus for
the talks.
   Accompanied by his wife, Nancy, the president will depart Sunday
morning on a 1{-hour flight to Moscow for his fourth summit with
Gorbachev since November 1985. They are to meet a total of six
hours from Sunday afternoon until Wednesday morning. The two will
say good-bye to each other Thursday.
   At Soviet insistence, the number of meetings was cut from five
to four. Reagan professed to be unconcerned, telling reporters at
the palace there only had been four meetings at the Washington
summit last December.
   ``I think we have to recognize that the (Soviet) government has
normal business that has to be conducted, and we have to schedule
accordingly. That's what we did in our summit in our town,'' Reagan
said as he posed for pictures with Finnish President Mauno Koivisto
in a second-floor salon adorned with silken draperies and crystal
chandeliers.
   Reagan also was asked about reports that the Soviets were
blocking various dissidents from attending a planned meeting with
him in Moscow on Monday. He looked quizzically at Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, seated to his right, and replied, ``We do
the best we can.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow has received assurances from the Soviets they will not block
dissidents and ``refuseniks'' from attending the meeting.
   ``The event is on as scheduled and the people we wanted there
will be there,'' he added. Fitzwater said the guests were picked
because ``they represent the problem that he (Reagan) is trying to
dramatize.''
   As for the reports that some people were being stopped from
attending, Fitzwater said, ``We're trying to ascertain the facts
and have made an inquiry of the Soviets.''
   Underscoring the sensitivity of the topic, Jewish groups
gathered in the Finnish capital to mount public pressure on Moscow
in behalf of Soviet Jews waiting for exit permits and those seeking
wider latitude to teach and practice their religion.
   In his speech, Reagan said human rights would be ``an integral
component'' of his dialogue with Gorbachev. In a pre-summit
briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway said it
would be ``subject No. 1.''
   The fact that the superpowers were not able to reach agreement
on a strategic arms treaty to be signed at the summit probably will
give even more visibility to the human rights issue.
   Praising Gorbachev for his ``glasnost''' and perestroika,''
Reagan said that ``since he began his campaign, things have
happened that all of us applaud.''
   He hailed the release from exile or labor camps Andrei Sakharov,
Irina Ratushinskaya, Anatoliy Koryagin, Josef Begun and other
dissidents and ``prisoners of conscience.''
   Reagan also noted that controversial books and movies are being
distributed, even though they are critical of the Soviet past and
present. The Soviets also are allowing a higher level of emigration
and greater toleration of dissent and are beginning to pull their
troops out of Afghanistan, he said.
   ``All this is new and good,'' he said. ``But there is another
list, defined not by us but by the standard of the Helsinki Final
Act and the sovereign choice of all participants, including the
Soviet Union, to subscribe to it.''
   Reagan on Friday said he welcomed ``every sign that the Soviets
and their allies are ready, not only to embrace, but to put into
practice'' Western values.
   ``The House of Democracy is a House whose doors are open to
all,'' Reagan said.
   He renewed his call for Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall
and other barriers between East and West.
   ``They could also give legal and practical protection to free
expression and worship,'' Reagan said.
   He also urged adoption of an independent judiciary, free
election of lawmakers, use of secret ballots in voting and freedom
of assembly.
   Before Reagan spoke, U.S. Jewish activists for Soviet Jews urged
the president to remind the Soviets that human rights were
indirectly linked to progress in arms control.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the National Council for Soviet
Jewry, said Jewish emigration is a ``test of whether arms
reductions can succeed.''
   Abram called the improvement in Jewish emigration figures
``insignificant compared with those who wish to leave ... It's
smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned.''

   The United States is withholding $25 million
from a United Nations family planning agency because of its support
for a program in China which is alleged to use coercive population
control methods, it was announced Friday.
   The Agency for International Development said the funds will
earmarked for U.S.-backed programs in Africa, Asia and Latin
America.
   The United States first withheld funds from the U.N. Fund for
Population Activities in 1985 after concluding that the agency
participated in the management of a program in China which involved
coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization.
   AID administrator Alan Woods said that a review of the program
indicated that the ``significant changes that would warrant
resumption of support have not occurred.''
   The study was carried out by the Census Bureau's Center for
International Research.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Fed Decision On Chase Securities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld a
Federal Reserve Board decision to allow an affiliate of Chase
Manhattan Corp. to underwrite and deal in commercial loan paper
under strict limitations.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here rejected a challenge by
the Securities Industry Association, which contended that allowing
an affiliate of a commercial bank to deal in loan securities
violated the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
   But a three-judge court unanimously upheld the Fed's decision to
allow the Chase Commercial Corp. to underwrite and deal in
commercial paper provided the transactions did not exceed 5 percent
of its gross revenues.
   The court, in an opinion by Circuit Judge James Buckley, noted
that the Fed had approved a similar application by Bankers Trust
New York Corp.
   Buckley, joined by Judges Harry Edwards and David Sentelle, said
the Fed had correctly interpreted the law as allowing a bank
affiliate to engage in a limited number of commercial paper
transactions.
   The Fed correctly decided that the prohibition on bank
affiliates ``principally engaged'' in securities transactions did
not apply in this case, the court said.
   ``The statute permits banks to affiliate with firms that are not
`principally' engaged'' in securities transactions, Buckley wrote.
``The board reasonably concluded that ``principally'' does not
include a firm whose commercial paper transactions are subject to
the limits included in its order.''

<HEAD>Tighter U.S. Sanctions Would Hurt South Africa, Business Group
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed U.S. legislation to
tighten economic sanctions against South Africa would hurt it more
than previous boycotts, a U.S. business group said Friday.
   The American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa said limited
U.S. sanctions imposed in 1986 carried little impact. But
legislation now being considered by Congress ``would have
far-reaching negative effects on all companies operating in South
Africa and on the South African economy as a whole,'' group
officials said.
   The chamber, which represents interests of U.S. companies in
South Africa, opposes sanctions. Five chamber members traveled to
Washington in April and met with congressmen and aides to lobby
against additional sanctions.
   ``The measures now being debated dwarf anything that's been done
so far,'' said Adriaan Botha, executive directer of the group.
   Both houses of Congress are weighing sanctions designed to
protest South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation.
The two similar bills would cut virtually all economic activity
between the two countries.
   The moves would include disinvestment by all U.S. companies,
whose South African investments are estimated at $1.1 billion.
   All trade would be banned, except for certain strategic minerals
the United States buys from South Africa. U.S. imports from South
Africa in 1987 were about $1.3 billion and exports were also $1.3
billion.
   Botha said the South African government's February decision
effectively banning 17 leading anti-apartheid organizations had put
the sanctions issue ``back on the boil'' in the United States.
   The limited sanctions approved by Congress in 1986 over
President Reagan's veto banned importation of certain goods and
halted direct air links between the two countries.
   The chamber said South Africa has become ``complacent about
further sanctions-disinvestment due to the fact that, in the short
term, a large number of individuals and companies have benefited.''
   Many American businesses that left South Africa sold profitable
operations to local businessmen at bargain prices. About 160
American companies have departed in the past two years, while about
155 remain.
   A wide range of South Africans, including some blacks and
anti-apartheid whites, oppose sanctions on the grounds that blacks
are most likely to suffer any economic hardships that result.
   Proponents of sanctions say economic pressure will speed up the
government's race reforms.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>West Germans Halt Investigation of Black Market Heavy Water Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German prosecutor has stopped the
investigation of a shipment of heavy water, a material used in
nuclear weapons production, that may have been transported
illegally to the Middle East, a U.S. expert and State Department
sources said Friday.
   Gary Milhollin, an American expert on the international market
in heavy water, said a Dusseldorf prosecutor has dropped the
investigation because he was convinced that documents were in order
for shipment of the Norwegian-made heavy water by a West German
company in 1983.
   ``He has decided that the water went where it was supposed to go
and has halted the investigation,'' said Milhollin, who is a
University of Wisconsin Law School professor on leave to the
Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington.
   The Associated Press in Frankfurt was unable to reach the West
German prosecutor for comment on the report, which was the second
allegation recently that Norwegian-produced heavy water had been
diverted illegally.
   Milhollin and a State Department official who spoke only on
condition of anonymity said the 1983 heavy water shipment may have
been diverted secretly to India by way of the Middle East.
   The State Department official said India has an interest in
acquiring heavy water secretly. He said undocumented heavy water
could be used secretly to produce and stockpile plutonium, which,
in turn, could be used to make atomic weapons in violation of the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   Milhollin said that in 1985, a West German company attempted to
hire an airline to fly undocumented heavy water to Bombay, India,
but that the airline declined to take the shipment. Because of this
history, he said, it is widely speculated that India received the
earlier secret shipment.
   The Indian government has denied the heavy water shipment was
transported to India.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used as a modulator in a
nuclear reactor. It permits reactors to run on natural uranium
instead of the more expensive and more tightly controlled enriched
uranium fuel. A byproduct from the nuclear reactor is plutonium,
the heart of nuclear bombs.
   On Tuesday, the Norwegian government said it also was
investigating whether a 1986 shipment of heavy water to Rumania had
been diverted improperly. Romania on Wednesday denied reports in
the Hungarian news media it had sold the 12{ ton heavy water
shipment to Israel.
   The State Department source said Friday that officials in Norway
were continuing to press for an investigation of the 1983 West
German shipment.
   A Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro, sold the shipment to the West
German concern, Rohstoff Einfuhr. Under the terms of the
international nuclear non-proliferation treaty, such sales are
subject to inspection and close documentation. West Germany and
Rumania are parties to the treaty.
   Milhollin said Norsk Hydro officials said they have four
documents showing Rohstoff Einfuhr was buying the heavy water for
shipment to Frankfurt. The documents include an export license from
the Norwegian government; an import certificate from West Germany;
an airbill from West African Airlines, which was transporting the
shipment; and a sales contract between the two companies.
   Despite the documents, however, the shipment was flown from
Norway to Switzerland, where another 6.6 tons of cargo was added.
The West Africa Airlines plane then flew from Switzerland to Dubai
in the United Arab Emirates. It later left Dubai, but its
destination was not been documented, Milhollin and the State
Department official said.
   Milhollin said the West German prosecutor decided to drop his
investigation after Rohstoff Einfuhr provided copies of a telegram
and a letter showing the destination of the heavy water shipment
had been changed from Frankfurt to Switzerland. The West German
company claims these documents were sent to Norsk Hydro in Norway.
   Officials at Norsk Hydro, however, claim the documents never
were received and that the heavy water was shipped with the
understanding that it was going West Germany.
   Fifteen tons of heavy water is sufficient to produce about 13
pounds of plutonium a year. A bomb the size of the first one
exploded over Japan in 1945 uses about nine pounds of plutonium.

<HEAD>NASA Inviting Industry Ideas For Using External Fuel Tanks In
Orbit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA, which expects to use and lose 40 space
shuttle external fuel tanks in flights over the next five years,
invited industry on Friday to come up with ideas for making
productive use of the tanks in orbit.
   Now, they are allowed to break up in the atmosphere and fall
into the ocean.
   The 152-foot tanks, which cost $25 million each, will be given
away free but the user must pay for any costs not incurred under
the present system of discarding them. The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration wants the money up front.
   A Colorado group, which represents 57 university research
institutions, has proposed to use tanks for ``a wide variety of
scientific and commercial concerns.'' The group, University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research, proposes ``parking'' the
exhausted tanks in orbit but NASA ruled out any such plan.
   The use must be stated in advance and a $100,000 deposit will be
required before the space agency provides services or technical
assistance.
   The external tank, about the size of a 747 jet transport,
consists of two pressurized fuel tanks _ one loaded with liquid
oxygen and one with liquid hydrogen. The half-million gallons of
fuel are used up in the 10 minutes it takes for the shuttle to get
into orbit and the tank is jettisoned just before that point.
   The space agency's announcement asks interested American
companies and non-profit organizations to propose uses within 90
days. It is in line with President Reagan's space policy which
calls for using the tanks for commercial purposes.
   NASA plans to launch 40 shuttles through 1994. It said the exact
number of tanks that could be made available will be decided
flight-by-flight depending on the characteristics of the mission
and the proposed use for a particular tank.

   African leaders Friday condemned
Western companies for dumping their nuclear and other wastes in
Africa and agreed to ask the United Nations to call for an end to
the practice.
   ``The dumping of nuclear and dangerous industrial waste in
Africa is a crime against Africa and the African peoples,'' the
Organization of African Unity said in a resolution adopted by heads
of state during the second day of their three-day summit. More than
30 leaders gathered with their aides at the 50-member body's
headquarters here.
   ``We will make an appeal to the conscience of the world,'' said
Foreign Minister Ike Nwachukwu of Nigeria, which sponsored Friday's
resolutions. ``All Africa feels strongly about it.''
   But Nigeria and other African states privately chastized some of
their fellow group nmembers for agreeing to take industrial waste
in return for millions of dollars. One resolution appealed to
African countries that have signed such agreements to abrogate them
and those still negotiating to break off talks.
   The controversy began this month in Guinea when officials
discovered that a Norwegian company had been dumping toxic waste on
an offshore island. The dumping was discovered when the island's
trees began to shrivel.
   Several African nations either have signed contracts to accept
industrial wastes, are negotiating, or have been approached, summit
sources said. The West African nations of Benin, Congo, Guinea
Bissau and Niger reportedly have signed contracts, and the tiny
southern African nation of Swaziland and Djibouti in East Africa
have been approached.
   Egypt, Gambia and Sierra Leone confirmed during Friday's debate
that they had been approached by companies looking for dump sites
for toxic wastes, but each government said it had rejected the
proposals. All three mentioned a company based on Gibraltar but
would not reveal the name.
   Guinea Bissau said it had asked the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to evaluate a request from a U.S. company to
export 6 million tons of hazardous waste to the West African nation.
   Foreign Secretary Marcellino Lima did not say what Guinea Bissau
was offered. But an environmental source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the deal was worth $15 million.
   Lima said he doubted Guinea Bissau would accept.
   Summit sources and reports from the Netherlands also said a
Dutch company had signed an $84 million contract with Congo to dump
1 million tons of chemical wastes in the West African state.

<HEAD>Dramatic Photo Warning on Acne Drug Unlikely To Be First of Many</HEAD>

   An unprecedented government order to include
the image of a deformed baby in packaging for the acne drug
Accutane is unlikely to be followed by similar orders for other
drugs with potential side-effects, analysts said Friday.
   On Thursday, the drug's maker, Hoffman-La Roche Inc. of Nutley,
released a Food and Drug Administration letter outlining stricter
warning requirements for the drug, which can cause life-threatening
damage to fetuses when taken by pregnant women.
   Among other restrictions, the FDA also wants La Roche to provide
a consent form to be signed by physician and patient saying they
understand the risks associated with the drug.
   Louis C. Webb of Advest Group Inc. in Hartford, Conn., a
business research firm, said he doubted that the use of a jolting
image such as a deformed baby would become widespread in the drug
industry.
   He called the photograph a compromise between banning the drug
and doing nothing, and said such a strong warning was acceptable to
regulators and the company because Accutane is not a lifesaving
drug.
   FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said the side effects of other drugs
are not as easily captured in a picture as a deformed infant, so
trying to apply images to other products would be impractical.
   Accutane, which was put on the market in 1982, can cause missing
facial features, heart problems and mental retardation in babies
born to women taking it. The FDA said 62 cases of birth defects
have been reported.
   But dermatologists have praised the drug as the only one on the
market capable of curing the severe acne that causes deep scarring.
   The new FDA requirements are based on the recommendations of an
advisory panel of outside experts, who also recommended that the
drug stay on the market. Accutane already carries explicit warnings
that its use by pregnant women carries a high risk of birth defects.
   Analysts and FDA officials said that including a deformed
infant's picture with the drug was a first.
   ``Because of the controversy, you're going to see a significant
decrease in the use of the drug,'' said Karl Habermas, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. in New York.
   Webb called the drug a ``significant'' but not major factor in
Swiss-owned La Roche's U.S. sales. Accutane sales last year
amounted to $60 million, or 16 percent of the company's U.S. oral
drug sales, he said.
   The deformed infant picture could affect sales, just as
``whenever you emphasize negatives,'' Webb said.
   ``I think that they're just trying to be absolutely clear that a
certain category (of patient) shouldn't use it,'' he said.
   La Roche spokeswoman Carolyn R. Glynn said ``our only goal is
making sure users don't get pregnant.''
   Ms. Glynn and Grigg said that the company and regulatory agency
basically agreed on the proposals outlined by the FDA, which were
contained in a letter dated May 19. The company is preparing a
formal response to the letter.
   One point of possible contention is the exact location of the
photograph. The FDA said the picture should go with packaging, but
Ms. Grigg said the company favors its inclusion somewhere in
``educational materials'' the company is developing to be provided
to prescribing physicians.
   ``There's not going to be a problem over that situation,'' said
Grigg. He said the agency and company already have discussed coming
up with a final proposal, and one possibility would be to put the
photograph with the consent form.

<HEAD>Bush Says Lobstermen Can Stay Near His Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush made a campaign promise
on Friday to his neighbors: Local lobstermen won't be barred from
the waters near his vacation home because of him.
   ``These men and women make their livelihood pulling lobsters out
of this bay. They've done it for years. And they're going to
continue to do it,'' he said.
   Bush, here for a week of rest and strategy talks, voiced concern
over local news accounts suggesting that if he wins the presidency
in November some of the waters of this seacoast town might be
closed to boaters, including lobstermen, for security reasons.
   ``That's absolutely absurd,'' he told a news conference at his
compound as a lone lobsterman plied his trade from his boat just a
few hundred yards away.
   Bush's family compound, comprising two homes and several smaller
guest cottages, sits on a narrow point _ Walker Point _ that juts
into the Atlantic Ocean.
   On the inland side, a dozen crab pots dot the small cove between
the Bush compound and the shore, all within a stone's throw.
   The shoreline and the road leading into the compound are heavily
guarded, but local lobstermen are currently permitted to work the
waters adjacent to Bush's property.
   ``I don't want to inconvenience our neighbors,'' said Bush, who
said he had been coming to the retreat for every summer of the 63
years of his life except one _ 1944, when he was at war.
   ``These people have been fishing in these waters, wartime or not
wartime, and I can't ever remember any different,'' he said.
   The issue of whether the Secret Service would declare the waters
around the Bush compound off-limits if he is elected has been the
subject of much recent local speculation. Bush said he wanted to
put the issue to rest.
   ``I don't want to convolute the life of people who earn their
livings here all year-round,'' Bush said.
   ``If it became a choice between whether these lobstermen can
fish in this bay, or I would stop coming to this place I love, I
would not come here,'' he said. ``And it would break my heart.''
   ``But it's not going to come to that,'' he added.

   Vice President George Bush and hundreds of Western
GOP leaders will meet here next month to show their support of the
party's presidential ticket and Republican candidates for other
offices.
   The event, which will begin June 10, is the first of four
planned by the Republican National Committee. Other such gatherings
will be in Boston, Chicago and Atlanta later this summer.
   Tom Hockaday, the Western regional political director for the
Bush campaign, said the purpose of the meeting is ``to bring
together not only the vice president but other (former)
presidential aspirants as well as to show we are all working
together to elect the vice president.''
   However, only one of the five former candidates _ Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York _ has said he will attend the two-day event.
   Spokeswomen for television evangelist Pat Robertson, former
Delaware Gov. Pete DuPont and Alexander Haig all said the former
candidates will not attend because of scheduling conflicts. Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas has not decided whether to attend, a spokeswoman
for Dole said.

<HEAD>Economist Says Anti-Alcohol Campaign Handled Poorly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet economist said Friday that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has mishandled his anti-drunkenness campaign by
emphasizing police methods instead of taking the long-range view of
offering consumers a better choice of goods.
   Nikolai Shmelev said the Soviet leader's campaign has driven
drinking underground, encouraged moonshiners and deprived the
government of liquor sales revenue.
   Shmelev, whose stinging criticisms of the Soviet economy in the
literary journal Novy Mir have caused a wave of controversy, spoke
to reporters at the Foreign Ministry and expanded on comments he
made in a recent article.
   He said the campaign got drunks off the streets and out of the
workplace.
   But he added, ``Unfortunately, I am afraid nothing has changed.''
   ``The structure of consumption has changed. Instead of
state-produced spirits they drink moonshine, they sometimes drink
chemicals,'' he said.
   Some Soviets turned to drinking hair tonic, cologne and rubbing
alcohol in a desperate search for spirits.
   Shmelev said a more effective but long-term way to solve the
drinking problem is to improve consumer supplies ``so a man could
use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or a good shirt.''
   Soviet consumer goods are of notoriously poor quality and in
short supply. Gorbachev has promised to improve the lives of
Soviets by improving the quantity and quality of food and consumer
goods.
   Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, his first major initiative
after taking power in March 1985, included raising the drinking
age, shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor
production.
   He and other officials credited the campaign with helping
increase the life expectancy for Soviet men in the past two years.
The Kremlin for years did not publish life expectancy figures,
presumably because they were embarrassing.
   Complaints have been voiced in the Soviet press, however, that
too many liquor stores have closed, forcing people who want to buy
an occasional bottle of wine or vodka to stand in line for hours.
   Shmelev said alcoholism will be a ``problem for a number of
generations, for a number of decades.''
   An economist close to Gorbachev, Abel Aganbegyan, told reporters
the anti-alcohol campaign achieved ``very impressive results'' in
cutting liquor sales.
   But he added, ``Now moonshine is consumed in great quantities,
even greater than before the anti-alcohol campaign was launched.''
   Aganbegyan said the effort to convince people not to drink was
poorly handled, and that sobriety societies set up across the
Soviet Union had not been effective.

   Japan's main opposition party fired the editor of
its newspaper Friday over an article saying the United States,
Japan, South Korea, and Bahrain were involved in the bombing of a
Korean jetliner last year.
   The action was taken after South Korea expressed anger over the
article, which quoted former South Korean Prime Minister Kim
Chung-yul as saying the governments of those countries were behind
the plane's disappearance.
   The Korean Air Lines Boeing 707 vanished off the coast of Burma
in November with 115 people aboard.
   Socialist Party General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi on Thursday
announced plans to retract the article and publish an apology on
the front page of the paper's next edition, due out May 31.
   The article, which appeared in the party's semi-weekly Shakai
Shimpo on Tuesday, quoted Kim as saying the plot was carried out to
ensure the election in December of Roh Tae-woo as South Korea's
president.
   ``Following a party executive meeting this morning, the editor
of the paper has been removed, and the reporter who wrote the
article has been warned,'' said a party spokesman who commented on
condition of anonymity.
   A member of the paper's editorial staff, who spoke on condition
he not be further identified, refused to say why the report had not
been more closely scrutinized prior to publication. He said that
since the newspaper has no correspondents in Korea, ``there may
have been limitations in translation.''
   Issei Inoue, head of the party's international division, was
called to the Foreign Ministry on Friday to explain the incident
after the South Korean government issued a formal protest late
Thursday night, the spokesman said.
   ``The honor of the Korean people has been seriously harmed by
the article,'' said South Korean Embassy minister Park Ryun in a
statement delivered to the Japanese government Thursday afternoon.
   South Korea has accused communist North Korea of blowing up the
plane in an effort to disrupt the Olympic Games in Seoul. North
Korea has been demanding to be a co-host of the Games but denied
involvement in the plane incident.
   A young woman who was a passenger on an early part of the flight
was arrested and said she was an agent trained in North Korea and
had planted a bomb on the plane.
   South Korea disagrees with the Japanese Socialist Party's
friendly stance toward North Korea.
   The party in turn has refused to recognize a 1965 bilateral
agreement normalizing Japan's relations with the southern half of
the Korean peninsula. Though Japan has no formal diplomatic ties
with the North, the Socialists and North Korea maintain good
relations.
   In a major policy shift last February, however, the party lifted
a long-standing ban on travel to South Korea by party officials in
recognition of Seoul's advancement toward democratization.

   Austria has admitted an ousted
black homeland leader charged with corruption, the Austrian Embassy
said Friday.
   Business Day newspaper said George Matanzima, former prime
minister of the nominally independent homeland of Transkei, left
South Africa for Austria last weekend.
   The embassy confirmed he arrived in Vienna on Monday on a
British Airways flight from London and was granted an entry visa at
the airport.
   Matanzima, 70, was ousted in a military-backed coup in October
after serving as prime minister since 1979. A warrant for his
arrest was issued on May 3.
   An inquiry commission has accused Matanzima of accepting a
$500,000 bribe from a construction company. The commission alleged
Transkei lost about $22 million because of improper actions by
Matanzima and his brother, former President Kaiser Matanzima.
   Transkei, now ruled by its army commander, is one of four tribal
homelands declared independent by South Africa but not recognized
abroad. It lies along the Indian Ocean coast between the port
cities of Durban and East London, covers 18,000 square miles and
has about 3.5 million residents.

   Four workers plunged 30 feet from a scaffold on
the Williamsburg Bridge on Friday afternoon, injuring two of them
critically, authorities said.
   The accident occurred on the Brooklyn side of the bridge, which
was closed April 12 to automobile and subway traffic due to severe
deterioration, said police spokesman Officer Joseph Gallagher.
   The four workers suffered broken bones, bruises and cuts after
falling onto concrete, said Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for the city
Emergency Medical Services. Two of them were in critical condition,
while the other two were in serious condition, she said.
   Authorities could not immediately say exactly what workers were
doing when the accident occurred.
   Traffic on the bridge, which was reopened for one-way traffic
Thursday, was snarled as police and emergency vehicles responded.
   A Transportation Department spokesman was out of his office and
unavailable for questions immediately after the accident.

   An earthquake Friday shook southern
Yugoslavia but apparently caused no injuries or damage, the
Belgrade seismological institute reported.
   It said the tremor occurred at 4:18 p.m. (10:18 a.m. EDT),
measured 4.9 on the Richter scale and had its epicenter in the
Homolje mountain region, 80 miles southeast of Belgrade, an
institute spokesman said.
   The quake shook wide regions of the republic of Serbia and was
also felt in Belgrade.
   ``Even though an earthquake of such intensity can cause
considerable damage, it is apparent from our first reports that
there was no damage or injuries,'' an institute spokesman told The
Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 4.0 on the Richter scale can cause
moderate damage in the local area and 5.0 considerable damage.

   Two women and a man forced their way
into the home of a supermarket mogul Friday and shot him to death
in front of his wife in what police said may have been a terrorist
attack by Galician separatists.
   No group claimed responsibility immediately in the death of
Claudio Sanmartin, 53, the chairman of two supermarket chains and
former chairman of Spain's largest regional savings bank, Caixa
Galicia.
   Police speculated, however, that the assailants may belong to
the Guerrilla Army of the Galician People, an obscure group seeking
independence from Spain for the northwestern region of Galicia.
   Hours earlier, a bomb explosion in Perbes, outside of La Coruna,
destroyed the unoccupied summer home of Manuel Fraga, a Galician
regional conservative leader, former Cabinet minister and now a
member of the European Parliament.
   No one was hurt and no group claimed responsibility, police
said. But the La Coruna civil governor, Andres Moreno Aguilar, said
the explosives used were of the kind used in the past by the
Guerrilla Army of the Galician People.
   Fraga, his wife and family were in Madrid where the politician
has lived for decades.
   Police said the guerrilla group has carried out 10 attacks on
high tension electric towers, bank offices, police cars and
industries in the Galician region in the past eight months.
   Sanmartin's wife told police a man and two women pretended to be
delivering flowers to the family's second-floor apartment, then
violently forced their way in. She said she called for help and her
husband came to the front door, where the man shot him in the head
and chest, officers reported.
   Police said neighbors told them the attackers then left and
calmly drove away in a waiting car.
   The bombing target, Fraga, is a native of Galicia who in 1977
founded the conservative Popular Alliance party, the largest
opposition party in the national Parliament. He resigned as party
president 1{ years ago.
   Last Saturday, the Galician branch of the party elected him as
its leader and named him its candidate for president of the
region's autonomous government in regional elections next year.
   Fraga served as tourism and information minister in the 1960s
and later as Spanish ambassador to Britain.

   The second fire to break out on an English
Channel ferry this week damaged the engine room of the 3,355-ton
European Trader on Friday but was quickly brought under control,
officials said. No one was reported injured.
   The vessel, carrying 85 passengers and crew, was assisted by
tugs to the French port of Dunkirk.
   P and O European Ferries Ltd. said the fire started before dawn,
20 miles northwest of Dunkirk, and filled the engine room with
smoke.
   The company said the crew smothered the blaze with carbon
dioxide before British firefighters and rescue workers arrived on
Royal Air Force helicopters. The cause of the fire was not
immediately determined, P and O said.
   The European Trader was the first vessel to break a 15-week-old
strike on P and O's Dover-Calais route when it sailed to the French
port on May 14.
   On Monday night on the same route, the world's busiest waterway,
one crew member died and another was badly burned when a fire
started in the engine room of the 5,917-ton freight ferry
Seafreight Freeway, owned by Sealink U.K. Ltd.
   Both fires occurred as the ferries sailed from the southeast
England port of Dover to Zeebrugge, Belgium. In March 1987 the
British ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized at Zeebrugge,
killing 193 people.

   Japan, after two years of negotiations with
the United States, has substantially agreed to supply a pressurized
laboratory module to the proposed space station, U.S. space
officials said Friday.
   Japan will be the last of America's international partners to
come aboard the largest cooperative civil and technology project
ever undertaken. Agreements have been reached with the European
Space Agency, representing 13 nations, and with Canada.
   Japan's module will be a permanently attached facility providing
a shirt-sleeve work environment for the space station crew, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said. There also will
be an exposed facility to be used for scientific observations,
communications, advanced technology development and other
activities that require direct exposure to space.
   Negotiators for Japan and the United States will submit the
proposed agreements to their governments, NASA said.
   The space station, which is having trouble getting money from
Congress, is envisioned to be in orbit and permanently manned by
the end of 1996. The cost to the United States is projected at $16
billion, Japan's at more than $1 billion and Canada's at $1 billion.

   The Federal Aviation Administration announced
Friday tighter restrictions on sightseeing flights over the Grand
Canyon to reduce noise levels and improve safety.
   The FAA said beginning next Sept. 22 sightseeing flights must
remain outside four designated ``flight free'' zones and elsewhere
fly at higher altitudes than before.
   Commercial sightseeing flights will have to remain outside the
four restricted zones and no lower than 5,000 feet above sea level
in the western section and 7,500 feet over the Boundary
Ridge-Sunpai Point area of the park, the FAA said.
   Special flight rules will apply to any pilot operating below
15,000 feet above sea level, the agency said.
   The FAA last year designated certain airspace over the canyon
for special flight rules. As part of the restrictions, flights also
are prohibited in the inner gorge and below the canyon rim except
in an emergency, the agency said.
   Congress enacted legislation last August requiring the Interior
Department to submit a flight restriction plan at the Grand Canyon.
The FAA was required to implement the Interior Department plan
unless the restrictions posed safety problems.
   The FAA said Friday the restrictions were not seen as posing
safety problems and generally follow the Interior Department
recommendations.

<TEXT>
   Economists for the nation's top businesses
said Friday they had boosted their growth forecasts for 1988, but
they still expect high interest rates to push the country into a
recession sometime next year.
   The latest survey of the National Association of Business
Economists showed a substantial upward revision in growth estimates
for this year compared with a survey done three months ago.
   The economists, who advise some of the country's largest
corporations, said they were looking for the gross national product
to expand 2.9 percent this year, which would match the performance
turned in during 1986 and 1987.
   Three months ago, the economists forecast a much slower 2.2
percent GNP increase in 1988.
   The survey was taken in early May before the government released
its revised estimate of economic growth for the first quarter. On
Thursday, the Commerce Department said the GNP rose at a robust
annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March.
   Kathleen Cooper, chief economist of the Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said if the survey were taken now,
most economists would boost growth estimates even higher.
   Some analysts are predicting the economy could grow at a 4
percent rate this year, which would be the fastest growth since
1984.
   In the survey, the economists said the reason for the increased
optimism was a belief that the country's trade deficit would show
more improvement because of higher-than-expected growth in U.S.
exports.
   The merchandise trade deficit, which hit a record $171 billion
last year, was predicted to shrink to $150 billion this year, a
drop of 12 percent. This is only slightly less optimistic than the
Reagan administration's projection that the trade deficit will
decline by 15 percent this year.
   The economists predicted the boom in U.S. export sales would
help push industrial production up a strong 4.5 percent this year.
   However, the economists expressed concerns that the rapid growth
in foreign demand, coupled with continued high consumer spending in
this country, would contribute to inflationary pressures and prompt
the Federal Reserve to step in with higher interest rates to cool
off the economy.
   The Fed already has tightened credit conditions twice in the
past two months, driving up a variety of interest rates, including
the prime rate and mortgage rates.
   Fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.58 percent this past week, the
highest level since the first of the year, the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. reported Friday.
   ``We see inflation coming it at 5 percent this year. That will
cause the Fed to tighten up and push interest rates up,'' Ms.
Cooper said. ``Higher interest rates are normally the way we get
into recessions in this country.''
   The survey found that a majority of the economists, 57.8
percent, believed the lengthy economic expansion, now in its sixth
year, will end with a recession beginning in 1989.
   On other issues, the survey of 58 business economists who
regularly make forecasts for their own companies found:
   _Consumer prices will rise by 4.3 percent in 1988, but the
inflation rate will jump to 5 percent in 1989.
   _The federal budget deficit, which fell to $148.9 billion in the
1987 fiscal year, will edge up slightly to $155 billion in the
current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   _Corporate profits will surge by 9.1 percent this year, even
better than the 8.7 percent profit increase of 1987.

<TEXT>
   The government has begun a safety
investigation into alleged failures in electrically powered front
seats in 1985 and 1986 Chrysler, Plymouth and Dodge automobiles,
the Transportation Department said Friday.
   The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration was prompted by 132 complaints about the operation
of the automatic seats in the Chrysler LeBaron, Laser and New
Yorker; Dodge 600, Daytona and Lancer; and Plymouth Caravelle.
   The government said the complaints included seven accidents
resulting in three injuries. In all, 195,000 Chrysler cars have
seats that potentially could fail, NHTSA said.
   The agency said a failure in the seat could cause a reduction in
seat strength and increase the likelihood of injury in a
rear-impact crash or cause the seat to recline rearward, resulting
in a driver losing control of the car.
   NHTSA said Chrysler Corp. ``is aware of the two failure modes
and has taken action to correct them, but has not conducted a
safety recall.''
   The automaker has strengthened the frame of the power seat and
seat adjuster in later model cars, the agency said.

   Two elementary school teachers gave their
students a lesson in love Friday, saying their wedding vows in a
classroom surrounded by the 50 children who helped bring them
together.
   Tim Peterson, a fifth-grade teacher at Wall School, and Kamela
Britvec, who teaches first grade, tied the knot in her homeroom as
their students read poetry and sang during the ceremony.
   The pair met last spring during a school outing shortly after
Peterson joined the faculty.
   ``We hear kids talk about divorce and bad relationships, and we
wanted to show them how a good relationship develops over time,''
said Britvec, 25.
   Peterson, 30, said his students thought he was joking when he
told them the wedding would be at school _ during school hours.
   ``The kids have been in on this relationship since day one,''
Peterson said after the wedding. So much so that some of the
students took credit for the marriage, the first for both the bride
and groom.
   ``If it wasn't for us, they wouldn't even be together,'' said
Richard Potts, 11, one of Peterson's fifth-graders. ``We told him
how to ask her out. He was too scared.''
   The students helped decorate the classroom and halls of the
475-pupil school in this small town near the Indiana border with
multi-colored streamers, paper flowers, wedding bells and
congratulatory signs.
   During the wedding, Mrs. Peterson's first-graders read a poem
they had written that included the verse, ``We feel good about
love.''
   After the ceremony, which was performed by Mayor Donald
Easterday, the children gave the Petersons a quilt with panels on
which they had drawn pictures.
   Some first graders had a few qualms about the proceedings.
   ``This is mushy,'' said 7-year-old Raymond Whitehead. But he
brightened up and added, ``I'll bet the cake will be good.''
   The kids got a break from afternoon classes for the wedding, but
Principal Earl Arend said he was sure their education didn't suffer.
   ``Who's to say where children learn the most, from a math book
or from some real life experience life a marriage ceremony?'' he
said.
   The couple said their students were the first to know of their
April 1 engagement. And the students' interest in this classroom
romance doesn't look like stopping with the wedding.
   ``They're already asking when we'll have a baby,'' Peterson
said. ``But we want to show them that in real life you don't have
to have a family besides just the two of you.''

   A black Cuban refugee jailed more than two years on
a murder charge despite two witnesses' testimony that the killer
was white has been released, ending an ordeal he said was ``not
supposed to happen in this country.''
   At one point prosecutors had said they would seek the death
penalty for Rigoberto Alberja, 32, indicted for first-degree murder
in the 1982 shooting of a patron at an Allapattah bar during a
holdup.
   Alberja was arrested in January 1986 on the tip of a police
informant even though the bar's two owners said the killer was
white and had straight hair.
   Alberja always maintained his innocence and refused offers to
plea bargain. Earlier this month, the state finally conceded it
could not prove its case, and Alberja was released.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Alberja's public defender, Art Koch.
``If all you got is two witnesses saying the guy was Caucasian and
you arrest a guy who isn't Caucasian, well then maybe you better
think you got the wrong guy.''
   Alberja said Thursday he had never been arrested before the
murder case, and was stunned by the treatment he got from the
United States.
   ``It is a great injustice,'' said Alberja. ``This happens in
other countries, but it's not supposed to happen in this country.''
   Alberja said that during his time awaiting trial in the Dade
County Jail, he was stabbed six times by another inmate. In
Florida, those accused of first-degree murder are automatically
jailed without bond pending trial.
   Prosecutor Mike Cornely defended his case despite the
identification problems. He said lengthy appeals over pre-trial
motions hampered his efforts.
   ``We had other information, a confidential informant and certain
other witnesses who knew something,'' said Cornely. ``But by the
time the appeal was done, a lot had dried up.''
   None of the five robbery victims at the bar could be located, he
said.
   He shrugged off the the discrepancy over Alberja's race. At the
time of the robbery, bar owners Terry Taylor and Edward Liles
helped sketch a picture of the suspect, who they said was white.
   But after the tip from the informant almost four years later,
investigators called in Liles, and he identified Alberja from a
photo lineup.
   ``I don't know what Liles' thinking was at first,'' said
Cornely. ``Maybe the lighting in the bar made him think the suspect
was white, but that's just a maybe.''
   But Cornely acknowledged that Liles' change of testimony _ and a
judge's decision to throw out the photo identification _ made his
case impossible.
   ``His ID alone would not fly,'' said the prosecutor. ``We need
other witnesses, and those witnesses disappeared.''

   Watching ``Bullwinkle'' head into the
Gulf of Mexico on Friday brought tears to the eyes of some who
worked on the colossal offshore drilling platform that will be
taller than Chicago's landmark Sears Tower.
   ``We've worked hard for three years, and an event like this can
be somewhat emotional,'' said Gordon Sterling, Shell Offshore
Inc.'s project manager for Bullwinkle. ``There were a few tears
watching it go by.''
   After the 1,368-foot, 50,000-ton Bullwinkle settles on the ocean
floor off the Louisiana coast, workers will install a deck and two
drilling rigs, bringing the leviathan's weight to 78,000 tons and
its height to 1,615 feet.
   ``That compares to the world's tallest building, which is the
Sears Tower, which is about 1,450 feet,'' Sterling said. The
tallest drilling platform is the 1,132-foot Shell Cognac platform,
installed off the Louisiana coast in 1976.
   Spectators lined the ship channel at Port Aransas on Friday to
see the Bullwinkle off, and police had to direct traffic. Even
lying on its side, it had no trouble dwarfing everything in sight.
   ``I made a trip up from South Padre Island to watch Bullwinkle
go out,'' Sam McSpadden said. ``I used to live in this town and
I've followed its progress since its inception.''
   Sterling has been in charge of the Bullwinkle project during
three years of construction at the Ingleside yard of Gulf Marine
Fabricators, which Shell contracted for construction,
transportation and installation.
   ``We wish we were building another one right now, wish we had
another one to start just as big as it or bigger,'' Gulf Marine
vice president Myron J. Rodrigue said after watching nine tugboats
pull the barge carrying the huge steel drilling jacket through the
Corpus Christi Ship Channel.
   At the project's peak, 700 people were employed in building the
structure at Ingleside, Rodrigue said. Shell estimates the total
cost of the Bullwinkle project at $500 million, including
construction, installation and related expenses. The company would
not specify how much the structure itself cost.
   The Bullwinkle, with a base measuring 4{ acres, has been a
fixture on the horizon during its development, visible for several
miles on the flat coastal plain in the Corpus Christi area.
   Traffic on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was diverted at the
beginning of May to prepare for loading the platform onto a
specially built barge that measures 853 feet long, 207 feet wide
and 49 feet deep.
   It is expected to take about three days to pull the structure
380 miles to its destination about 150 miles southwest of New
Orleans.
   The base will be flooded to bring the drilling jacket to rest in
1,353 feet of water in Shell's Green Canyon lease, with
installation expected to take about three months.
   Twenty-eight pilings for Bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into
the sea floor and secured with cement. Bullwinkle is designed to
withstand at least a 72-foot hurricane wave, with the ability to
sway more than 6 feet without stress damage.
   Shell estimates that production will begin in the first quarter
of 1989, and will eventually put out 50,000 barrels of oil and 90
million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
   The Bullwinkle project was conceived nearly five years ago, when
oil was well above $20 a barrel, Sterling said.
   ``Even today at $15 it's a (profitable) venture,'' he said, but
added he will not brag until Bullwinkle is in place and producing.
   ``Bullwinkle'' was a code name given to the project when Shell
was bidding for the Green Canyon underwater site.

   The Senate on Friday ratified, 93-5, a treaty
to abolish medium-range nuclear missiles, enabling President Reagan
to present the pact to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their
Moscow summit next week.
   It was the first major U.S.-Soviet arms control accord ratified
by the Senate since 1972.
   Leading up to the ratification vote, the Senate rejected four
minor amendments offered by Republicans. That brought to 14 the
number of amendments proposed by GOP conservatives and rejected
during two weeks of floor consideration of the treaty.
   The Senate's consent to ratification, which required a two-third
majority, had long been assured because only a handful of
conservatives opposed the pact.
   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina.
   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did not vote.
   Spectators crowded into galleries overlooking the Senate floor
gave a standing ovation after the vote tally was announced.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and GOP Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., quickly informed Reagan of the outcome in a telephone
call to Helsinki, Finland, where the president was resting in
advance of the summit.
   The two leaders accepted Reagan's invitation to come to Moscow
next Tuesday to witness the exchange of treaty documents. The White
House said presidential chief of staff Howard Baker would fly to
Moscow to deliver the U.S. ratification materials Sunday.
   In a statement issued by the White House, the president said he
was ``very pleased'' by the vote, which ``clearly shows support for
our arms reduction objectives.''
   He added, however: ``I continue to have concerns about the
constitutionality of some provisions of the resolution of
ratification, particularly those dealing with interpretation, and I
will communicate with the Senate on these matters in due course.''
   Byrd told Reagan, ``Bless your heart. We're just delighted that
we're going to send you a treaty and it was almost a unanimous vote
... we'll have a little blue ribbon tied around it.''
   Dole told the president, ``We are very pleased to be able to
give you this (ratification) in advance of your stepping on Soviet
territory in Moscow.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the pact Dec. 8 at their summit
meeting in Washington, and the administration had pushed for Senate
action before the Moscow summit.
   Administration officials also waged a successful fight to win
Senate approval without so-called ``killer amendments'' that would
have required U.S.-Soviet negotiations to be reopened.
   Conservative Republican critics mounted several attacks, but all
their attempts were easily turned back.
   The only major change was a Democratic-backed amendment to the
ratification resolution, barring future administrations from
changing the U.S. interpretation of the treaty without prior Senate
approval. That arose from a fight with Reagan over the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the last arms pact to win Senate
ratification.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty provides for
the elimination within three years of all medium-range missiles
with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. The Soviets would destroy
1,752 missiles while the United States would eliminate 867,
including both deployed and non-deployed weapons.
   The INF pact is the first in the 40-year history of U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms control to require the actual destruction of weapons.
Other accords simply slowed the buildup of each side's vast nuclear
arsenals.
   In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive and
stringent verification procedures in arms control history. The key
verification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regular
basis and through challenges by each side.
   Elimination of the medium-range missiles still will leave
thousands of nuclear weapons in Europe. The United States has about
4,300 short-range atomic weapons of various kinds in Western
Europe, while Great Britain and France have their own nuclear
arsenals.
   While the pact will only provide for reductions of about 3
percent in each side's arsenal, administration and congressional
supporters say they hope it will be a blueprint for a more
far-reaching treaty reducing long-range weapons.
   That proposed pact, known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START), is the subject of ongoing U.S.-Soviet negotiations and is
likely to be a key topic at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.
   Both sides are still far apart on the proposed START treaty, and
one of the main sticking point is how to verify it. On-site
inspections would have to be even more far-reaching than those in
the INF Treaty.
   In addition to serving as a first major step to START, the INF
Treaty should also prod the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to improve its array of conventional weapons,
supporters argued during the congressional debate.
   ``INF is a beginning, not an end,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   Nunn was referring to NATO's need to improve its conventional
defenses. The Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies outnumber NATO
in a variety of numerical categories of weapons, including tanks
and artillery pieces.
   The INF pact was hailed as ``NATO's finest hour'' by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz, a theme restated often during Senate
consideration of the accord.
   Shultz was referring to NATO's decision to go ahead with the
1983 deployments of the new U.S. nuclear weapons, despite strong
protests in some NATO nations, particularly Britain and West
Germany. Those deployments were considered the key to the final
agreement.

<HEAD>Scriptwriters OK Independent Contracts With 70 TV, Movie Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking TV and movie scriptwriters will
resume work for more than 70 producers, including makers of the
top-rated ``The Cosby Show,'' under independent contracts approved
by the writers' union Friday.
   The independent contracts were approved by 86 percent of the
2,016 members of the Writers Guild of America who voted Thursday
night in New York and Los Angeles, said union spokeswoman Cheryl
Rhoden.
   The producers' bargaining group, the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers, dismissed the defections of the mostly
small production companies as an insignificant episode in the
12-week strike, which has forced delays in the start of the fall
television season.
   By Friday noon, a union list of producers who had signed
included Carsey-Werner Co., which makes ``Cosby,'' and the makers
of ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' ``Highway to
Heaven'' and ``It's Garry Shandling's Show.''
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg estimated the independent
contracts, which accede to writers' key pay demands, cover just 1
percent of the union's 3,000 working members, and none of the big
production companies that form the backbone of the industry group.
   ``It had virtually no impact on prime-time network (programs),''
Steinberg said of the vote.
   ``Not one alliance member is in this group,'' Steinberg said of
the producers who had signed on. ``They voted to put 72 writers to
work ... we're concerned with getting 3,000 writers back to work.''
   Many of those who signed were one-person writer-producer
companies, and some listed make TV shows that have been cancelled,
including the Smothers Brothers' comedy show and ``Days and Nights
of Molly Dodd,'' Steinberg said.
   But Ms. Rhoden termed the defections a symbolic victory as well
as a break in management ranks.
   ``We're very, very pleased,'' Ms. Rhoden said. ``The significant
thing is that upwards of 70 companies ... feel they can do
profitable business under a contract that also respects the needs
of writers.''
   The three-year contract accepts the writers key demand:
Retention of the present formula for the payments, known as
residuals, which writers get for reruns of one-hour television
shows.
   Citing the increasing difficulty in selling such shows for
rerun, the producers are seeking to link the amount of the residual
payments to a show's success in rerun, or syndication as it is
known in the industry.
   The contract also boosts residual payments for use of the
writers' work overseas and tightens requirements that writers be
consulted about script changes made during filming. The union
contract also boosts minimum pay scales for writers.
   The writers walked out March 7, and until this week, only one
bargaining session was held.
   Talks Wednesday at the producers' headquarters in Los Angeles'
Sherman Oaks district failed to make progress.
   The negotiators agreed to resume formal talks Tuesday under the
guidance of a federal mediator, and small groups were scheduled to
hold preliminary discussions Saturday.

<HEAD>Sunshine, Mild Temperatures Herald Pleasant Weekend in Most Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunshine and mild temperatures covered much of the nation Friday
afternoon, heralding what is expected to be a pleasant, sunny
holiday weekend for the central and eastern United States.
   Skies were clear from the central Appalachians across the middle
and lower Mississippi Valley to the central and southern Plains,
while partly cloudy skies covered the Northeast, Florida, the
northern Plains and much of the West.
   Temperatures approached 90 degrees over western portions of the
northern and central Plains, while afternoon readings were well
into the 90s in the desert Southwest.
   Cloudy skies covered much of the Carolinas, keeping temperatures
unseasonably cool in the 60s and 70s. Asheville, N.C., set a record
low for the date with a reading of 38 degrees early in the day.
   A few showers dotted the upper Mississippi Valley, and showers
and thunderstorms hit parts of Colorado and southern Florida. Rain
also fell on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
   In the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT, Quillayute, Wash.,
received nearly hald an inch of rain. No other location reported
more than a quarter inch during the period.
   A wind advisory was in effect for southern Nevada, with gusts to
40 mph expected.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 55 degrees at Astoria,
Ore., to 99 degrees at Tucson, Ariz.
   The forecast for Saturday called for widely scattered
thunderstorms from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas across the
Rockies to portions of Idaho and Utah, from northern Michigan to
the Dakotas, and in southern Florida. Scattered showers were
predicted along the Canadian border from Maine to New York State.
   The Pacific Northwest is the only area expected to get much wet
weather this weekend. A strong cold front is headed for the region
and rain and mountain snows are forecast across the Pacific
Northwest on Saturday and in northwest Nevada by early Sunday.
   Highs were forecast in the 80s to near 90 degrees over most of
the nation; in the 70s over Maine and parts of the East Coast and
northern Michigan; in the 60s or 70s in the northern Rockies, the
Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; and in the 90s to
near 100 degrees from the Rio Grande Valley to the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>2,000 Protest Danube Power Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 Hungarian environmentalists
marched to the Austrian Embassy on Friday to protest a Danube River
power project near Nagymaros, Hungary, which is being financed by
Austria, a participant said.
   The man said police refrained from interfering and even cleared
the way for marchers through car-congested streets from downtown
Budapest to the embassy in the foreign diplomats' central district.
   The marcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called it an
unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the
unofficial Danube Circle ecological group.
   In another departure, state-run television ran, without comment,
a one-minute film segment on its main evening newscast showing
protesters arriving at the embassy. Among them was biologist Janos
Varga, a leader of the ecologists.
   The marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to
the project, a joint venture involving hydropower installations on
the Danube at Gabcikovo in Czechoslovakia and at Nagymaros.
   Banners read ``We Want Clear Water,'' ``No Dams'' and ``We Want
Our Danube.''
   Hungarian and Austrian ecologists have said that damming up the
Danube water and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water
reserves of millions of Hungarians and destroy large areas of
riverside forestland in both Hungary and Czechsolovakia.
   The protester said demonstrators were met with applause and
cheers from passers-by on the march to the embassy.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed on May 29, 1986, 70
percent of the construction work $483 million will be carried out
by Austrian companies.
   A delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand
over a resolution protesting Austria's financial participation,
Austria Press Agency reported.
   It said the Austrian ambassador was not there but promised the
protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea.

   Bess Myerson, former Miss America and
New York cultural affairs commissioner, was arrested Friday and
charged with trying to shoplift $44 in merchandise from a
department store.
   Miss Myerson appeared before District Justice John M. McDermott
and was released on $150 cash bail.
   The 63-year-old New York City resident, already facing federal
fraud and bribery-related charges, contested South Williamsport
police allegations that she tried to leave Hill Department Store
with six bottles of nail polish, five pairs of earrings, shoes and
flashlight batteries in her purse and shopping bag.
   ``I was leaving the store to lock my car and come back and pay
for the merchandise,'' she told the magistrate.
   She said she would pay her fine and costs ``under protest''
through the mail, if court documents affirm her contention that
this is her first such offense. The maximum penalty, according to
the court, would be a $300 fine.
   ``If true, it's extraordinarily sad that this could have
occurred,'' New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch said of the charge.
Miss Myerson was his campaign manager in 1977 when Koch was first
elected mayor.
   The New York Daily News earlier this month quoted unidentified
sources and records as saying Miss Myerson was charged in 1970 with
shoplifting from a London department store. The newspaper said she
left London without taking care of the charge and paid a fine of no
more than $100 in 1987 to end the case.
   The Daily News said it could not determine what was stolen.
   Miss Myerson was indicted by a federal grand jury last October
on charges she tried to influence the judge handling the divorce
case of her reported lover, millionaire Carl A. Capasso.
   Capasso, serving time at nearby Allenwood Federal Prison Camp
for tax evasion, also was indicted in the case. The two are
scheduled to go on trial Sept. 14.
   Miss Myerson asked at Friday's arraignment whether her arrest
must be publicized. When told it would be published, she retorted,
``So be it.'' She was escorted from the hearing room to her car by
police.
   Should she contest Friday's retail theft charge, she faces a
June 27 preliminary hearing before District Justice Gerald C. McGee.

   A pair of top Soviet economists on Friday said
progressive taxes on small businesses are an example of
bureaucratic meddling that will discourage growth of consumer goods
and services.
   Abel Aganbegyan, an economist close to Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, told reporters the progressive taxes as high as 90
percent were ``adopted behind closed doors'' by the Finance
Ministry.
   ``Some provisions are faulty. They didn't know much about
progressive taxation,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has said the cooperatives _ employee-owned small
businesses _ are a key element of his plans to improve the supply
of goods and services to consumers, who face widespread shortages
in the state-run economy.
   The Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament, on
Thursday passed a law expanding the rights of the cooperatives to
compete with the inefficient state-run economy.
   And in a rare move, the body also expanded the rights of local
government to give tax breaks to preferred kinds of cooperatives
and directed that the progressive tax structure decreed April 1 by
the Finance Ministry be rewritten.
   The Supreme Soviet normally only rubber stamps legislation that
already has been approved by the Communist Party, the dominant
force in Soviet society.
   Nikolai Shmelev, an economist with the Soviet Union's
U.S.A.-Canada Institute, said the tax rates decreed by the Finance
Ministry apparently will remain in effect until they can be
rewritten.
   Tax rates for workers at cooperatives are 27 percent on a
monthly income of $1,600 and 53.5 percent on an income of $3,200.
The government has not said what income would be affected by the
maximum 90 percent tax.
   The average industrial worker earns about $320 a month. Workers
in the state sector pay a flat 13 percent tax if they earn more
than $480 a month.
   ``I think this law on progressive taxation on cooperatives is
very bad. It puts obstacles in the way of development of
cooperatives,'' Shmelev said.
   He said the debate in the Supreme Soviet was an encouraging sign
of life in that body.
   Aganbegyan said the tax rates probably would be on the books for
a year or more before they could be amended.
   Eventually, he said a uniform progressive tax rate should be
developed for those who work in cooperatives and those who for
state-run enterprises.
   The law approved Thursday by the Supreme Soviet legally puts
cooperatives on an equal footing with state-run enterprises. It
ensures that cooperative property may not be seized by the state,
allows cooperatives to own buildings and other property not
including land, and them to conduct business with overseas
companies and earn hard currency.

   An explosion in a garbage
truck Friday night injured the driver and set the vehicle afire,
police reported.
   Police spokesman Pierre Louw said the explosion occurred while a
worker was loading a garbage bin into the back of the truck in
downtown Johannesburg. He said the worker was not hurt but the
driver suffered minor injuries to his face and one arm.
   Louw said police had not determined the cause but suspected it
was a limpet mine, an explosive device that clings to other objects.
   There was no claim of responsibility. Police blame nearly all
explosions the African National Congress, the main guerrilla group
fighting white domination.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, seldom confirms or denies
involvement in specific attacks but acknowledges using bombs in its
campaign against the government.
   More than 70 bombings have been reported in South Africa since a
nationwide state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986, to thwart
an uprising in black townships.
   Two bombs went off Thursday in Pretoria, wounding four white
women. The explosions coincided with the 40th anniversary of rule
by the National Party, architect of the apartheid policy that
preserves power for the 5 million whites and denies a voice in
national affairs to the 26 million blacks.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments Presented In AIDS Patient's Suit Against Blood
Bank</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a woman who contracted AIDS
through a 1983 blood transfusion told a jury Friday that the blood
bank failed to screen donors properly and the doctors who saw her
later treated her like ``a medical yo-yo.''
   Susie Quintana, 50, of Dolores, and her husband, Chris, 53, are
suing United Blood Services, whose blood bank in Albuquerque, N.M.,
supplied the contaminated plasma; their former family doctor,
Edward G. Merritt; and Dr. Donald Kearns, a Denver infectious
disease expert who first tested Mrs. Quintana for exposure to the
virus that causes AIDS.
   Lawyers have said the case may be the first case in the nation
in which a jury will decide an AIDS victim's claim against a blood
bank. In a 1986 California case, a jury was chosen but the lawsuit
was settled out of court before the trial ended.
   After closing arguments wind up, District Judge John W. Coughlin
said, he would allow the six-member jury to decide whether to
recess for the holiday weekend or begin deliberations Saturday. The
trial began three weeks ago.
   Mrs. Quintana's attorney, Maureen Reidy Witt, said UBS and the
doctors were uninformed and insensitive to the physical and
emotional needs of their patient.
   UBS attorney Douglas Irish said the jury must judge the
defendants on the acceptable standards of care at the time Quintana
received the transfusion, arguing that a test to detect AIDS virus
in donated blood did not exist in 1983.
   He cautioned the jury that UBS' actions ``cannot be judged by
you using wisdom gained from hindsight.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease that attacks
the body's immune system. It is transmitted through sexual contact
or contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids.
   Mrs. Quintana received the deadly virus in a 1983 blood
transfusion at Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez during
treatment for an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound.
   The other two defendants, the two doctors, were accused of
failing to properly diagnose or counsel her later.
   ``Susie was lonely, abandoned and scared and was a medical yo-yo
betwen Dr. Merritt and Dr. Kearns, who said, `You do have it, you
don't have it, you do have it,''' Witt said.
   ``That was in the spring of 1986, when they knew she had two
positive test results.''
   Witt said the doctors were also negligent in failing to explain
to the couple what precautions they should have taken to prevent
transmission of the disease. Although the couple testified they had
sexual relations following the tests, Chris Quintana has tested
negative for the AIDS virus.
   Though UBS argued that the AIDS blood test became available only
in 1985, Witt said the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta said in December 1982 that AIDS transmission was linked to
homosexual and bisexual men and to blood transfusions.
   The blood bank had options to screen donors, such as direct
questioning or physical examinations, Witt argued. ``United Blood
Services chose d), none of the above,'' he said.
   The lawsuit didn't specify the amount of damages sought, but
Witt suggested the jury award damages of mroe than $13 million.
   Irish said in closing arguments that the defendants were
sympathetic, and regret that she contracted AIDS from the
transfusion.
   ``But the plaintiffs are not asking for our sympathy,'' Irish
said. ``They are here to ask you to move a bag of money _ maybe $13
million, maybe more _ from this table to that table.''
   Irish said the only person who can be blamed is the donor, who
has admitted to carrying the AIDS virus.
   ``We are not liable for that man's conduct,'' Irish said.

   The government of Afghanistan has
pardoned imprisoned French journalist Alain Guillo, state-owned
Radio Kabul said Friday.
   In Paris, the French Communist Party newspaper L'Humanite said
Guillo would be freed Saturday.
   Guillo, a freelancer, was arrested while filming the Afghan war
in northern Afghanistan last September. He was convicted in January
of spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, quoted Afghan President
Najib as saying Guillo was pardoned in view of ``the old friendship
between France and Afghanistan.''
   He said it was also in view of the Geneva accords signed April
14 to withdraw more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and helped
the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels.
Afghanistan, neighboring Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet
Union signed the Geneva accords.
   Najib announced the pardon after Gilbert Perol, secretary
general of the French External Affairs Ministry, met with Najib,
the newscast said. Perol delivered a personal message from French
President Francois Mitterrand, it said.
   Eric Fornier, spokesman for the French Embassy in Islamabad,
could not confirm the reports that Guillo would be freed Saturday.
   ``Certainly it will be in the next two to three days,'' Fornier
said.
   Guillo has shared a prison cell in Kabul with Italian journalist
Fausto Biloslavo, who is serving a similar sentence, but there was
no word on whether Biloslavo would be released.
   Western diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they expected Biloslavo's release soon because Najib is trying
to polish his government's image during the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   The Kabul correspondent for L'Humanite, Francis Cremieux, said
Guillo would fly out of Kabul Saturday afternoon and could arrive
in Paris early Sunday. Cremieux, who had met with aides to the
president, reported earlier this week that Guillo would be freed
soon.
   French journalists met with Guillo on May 14 at the
Poul-E-Charki prison near Kabul. They quoted him as saying then
that he would never ask for a pardon because he was innocent of the
spy charges and considered himself a hostage, not a prisoner.

<HEAD>Bank Board Announces Plan To Rescue S&L</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday
it was spending $304 million to rescue the Eureka Federal Savings
and Loan Association of San Carlos, Calif.
   America First Financial Corp. of San Francisco will contribute
another $100 million to the package and acquire Eureka's deposits
and 35 branch offices in northern California. The offices will
remain open under the Eureka name.
   The bank board will contribute $291 million in cash from the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures S&L
deposits up to $100,000, to cover Eureka's negative net worth.
   The remaining $23 million in estimated costs to the insurance
fund, which is funded through fees charged the industry, will come
from the purchase of loan participations and coverage of America
First against future loss on problems loans and against challenges
to the rescue package.
   As part of the deal, the bank board will receive $50 million
stock in America First, an affiliate of America First Companies of
Omaha, Neb., and share equally in tax benefits arising from the
transaction.
   Eureka, with $1.74 billion in assets as of March 31, was founded
in 1937. It's been in trouble since the early 1980s, when interest
rates soared, leaving many S&Ls holding low-rate mortgages.
   The bank board, in a release, also attributed the insolvency to
``unsafe and unsound loan underwriting practices.''
   Bank board Chairman, M. Danny Wall, the top federal regulator of
S&Ls, said the rescue was ``especially significant'' because of the
amount of private investment in the deal, which is a record for an
S&L rescue.
   ``This transaction is further evidence ... that the thrift
industry is a good place to invest for the future,'' Wall said in a
statement.
   The Eureka deal is the 34th bailout or shutdown of a failed S&L.
Twenty-three of the 34 were acquired by investors or merged with
existing institutions with FSLIC assistance.

<HEAD>Army Speeds Plan to Shield Helicopters Against Radio Wave
Interference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has decided to accelerate plans to
shield a key control unit in the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter against
radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in
Europe, a spokesman said Friday.
   The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a huge
antenna farm banked into a right-hand turn for five seconds without
any pilot commands, also has prompted the Army to instruct its
pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in
West Germany.
   Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about the
effects of so-called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk,
extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing
with a ``nuisance'' problem and not a phenomenon that affects
flight safety, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.
   ``We certainly are not going to ground the fleet, because
there's no reason to do so,'' Soucy added.
   But Soucy said the Army intends to accelerate its plans to add
shielding to the electronic controls on the craft's hydraulic
control system because of the test results. The service already had
opened talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,
on shielding a number of electronic components ``because our pilots
shouldn't have to worry about nuisance'' signal interference, Soucy
said.
   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigators
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk
accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen.
   ``Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiring
and electrical components and generate false commands that can
range from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash to
sending it into a fatal dive,'' the report said.
   The Army and Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the United Technologies
Corp., adamantly disputed that report, saying there was no evidence
electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes.
   The service had acknowledged earlier that radio wave
interference could cause ``uncommanded control inputs,'' moving the
helicopter's horizontal stabilator slightly, but not to the extent
of posing a flight safety hazard. There is a switch in the cockpit
that allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator, the
Army says.
   Last month, a Blackhawk operating near a large array of
high-intensity antennas in West Germany experienced some unusual
blinking lights and alarm horns, Soucy said. The Army then
attempted to replicate that incident with special instruments and
test pilots.
   On May 11, during a test, ``the aircraft turned to the right on
its own for about five seconds while flying near the antenna
farm,'' Soucy said. ``We believe the hydraulic logic module inside
the Blackhawk was being affected.''
   The spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter was
flying to the antenna farm, but said it was transmitting with a
combined power in excess of 400 million watts of power.
   While the test suggests that large levels of electromagnetic
interference actually can affect the controls of the Blackhawk,
``the effect is very brief'' and doesn't pose a threat of losing
control of the copter, Soucy said.
   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is
replacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as the
Army's primary air assault and air cavalry craft. It was introduced
in April 1981.
   The Army currently has more than 900 Blackhawks in its inventory
and plans to buy about 1,700 of the choppers. Each craft costs
roughly $6 million.

<HEAD>PLO to Seek Clear-Cut Arab Stands Toward Palestinians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A PLO official said Friday the Arab
nations are not giving Palestinians the political and financial
support they need to continue the 6-month-old uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Bassam Abu Sharif said the guerrilla movement will demand clear
stands on the Palestinian issue from all governments during the
Arab summit that begins June 7 in Algeria's capital.
   ``The Algiers summit will be the purgatory through which
everyone will have to pass,'' said Abu Sharif, media advister to
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   He made the comments in an article in the London-based
newsletter Mideast Mirror. A copy was telexed to The Associated
Press in Bahrain.
   ``The question that will be asked both in private and in public
will be: `Who among you supports the establishment of a Palestinian
state and who opposes it?','' he said. ``There will be no room for
double talk or half-baked positions.''
   All Arab governments express public support for creation of a
Palestinian state, but hardliners often accuse pro-Western
moderates of avoiding conflict with U.S. Middle East policy.
   The American plan, promoted in trips to the region by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz, proposes limited self-rule for the 1.5
million Palestinians of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   As of Friday, 198 Palestinians and two Israelis had died in
violence in the occupied territories since the unrest began Dec. 8.
   Abu Sharif claimed the summit had been delayed because of a
``tug of war'' behind the scenes between moderates and hardliners
over the Palestinian issue.
   He said President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria took the
initiative to call for the summit because of ``a justified belief
that Arab officialdom was guilty of dereliction of duty toward the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied land.''
   Algeria felt Arabs ``not only withheld financial support to the
Palestinians but also kept them under political siege,'' he wrote.
   He argued that the Palestinian uprising had succeeded in putting
the latest U.S. peace initiative ``in a vicious circle'' despite
the support of Washington's ``allies'' in the region. He did not
name the allies.
   Abu Sharif claimed the purpose of the current trip to the Middle
East by Vernon Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was
to press for ``starving the PLO of funds'' in order to hamper its
support for the uprising.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis will try
to resolve his differences with Jesse Jackson before the party's
July nominating convention, aides say, but will not give in to
Jackson's demands for cuts in defense spending and higher taxes on
the wealthy.
   Dukakis aides, careful not to criticize the civil rights leader,
point out that Dukakis will likely secure the nomination when the
primary season concludes on June 7 and thus will be negotiating
with Jackson from a position of strength. They said Dukakis will
not make concessions that could hurt his chances against certain
Republican nominee George Bush.
   ``Our negotiating position will be very strong,'' Dukakis
spokesman Leslie Dach said in an interview Thursday. ``Our ultimate
goal is to resolve our differences as much as we can. But we're not
going to negotiate our basic stands. You're not going to see any
kind of fundamental shifts.''
   On the stump, Jackson contends he is swaying Dukakis. ``He is
adjusting to a new agenda,'' Jackson told a California rally on
Thursday.
   But in reality, Dukakis has rejected many Jackson proposals,
including his calls for defense cuts and higher taxes for the
wealthy and large corporations.
   Dukakis aides also say a national health insurance proposal
espoused by Jackson is far more expensive than an employer-funded
program backed by Dukakis, who also has rejected Jackson's call for
spending $2.5 billion to improve education programs. ``We simply
don't feel there is the money there to spend,'' said Dukakis issues
adviser Tom Herman.
   For now, Dukakis aides say they will confine the public debate
over Dukakis-Jackson differences to public statements of the
candidates and ongoing discussions over the convention platform.
   ``We hope they will reach as many agreements as they can and
when that process is further along it will be time to go back see
where our differences are,'' Dach said. ``We're very comfortable
that we will be at the convention with a very clear working
majority.''
   While the Dukakis campaign hopes to avoid public feuding or a
fallout with Jackson, it is at the same time sending subtle signals
to Jackson and expanding its outreach to black voters in case
Jackson refuses to support Dukakis. Up to 100 black Dukakis
supporters from across the country are scheduled to meet in Boston
on Monday to discuss a fall strategy.
   ``I hope everybody has the same sense heading into this
convention,'' Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said when
asked about potential conflicts with Jackson. ``There is a real
sense that we Democrats can win. Bush has real vulnerabilities.
   ``We Democrats, if we don't shoot ourselves in the foot, can win
and I don't think there is anybody in our party who wants to wake
up the day after the election and have it said that if it wasn't
for him we would have won.''
   Estrich met with Jackson convention manager Ron Brown this week
and speaks frequently with her counterpart in the Jackson campaign,
Gerald Austin. She refuses to discuss the substance of the talks.
   Dukakis convention manager Marcia Hale also has scheduled
meetings with Brown, and the candidates themselves met privately
Wednesday following a debate in California.
   ``Would I like to see a peaceful convention? Yes,'' Hale said.
``But there are lots of negotiations that need to take place.''
   Brown, in a telephone interview Friday, said: ``There might be
some items that compromise cannot be found on. But I'm not prepared
to say what our priority issues will be. ... There have not been
any substantive conversations on platform issues.''
   He disputed the Dukakis aides' boast about negotiating strength.
   ``We don't expect that anyone will have a nominating majority of
the delegates when we go into the convention,'' Brown said. Despite
that position, it appears very likely Dukakis will have the 2,081
delegates needed for nomination.
   Dukakis aides insist their convention planning is just beginning
but say Jackson will have a major role. The Dukakis camp also is
expected to seek to appease Jackson by agreeing to a strong
statement denouncing apartheid in South Africa and supporting
sanctions against the country, although it is unclear whether
Dukakis wants such a statement as part of the platform or whether
he will agree with Jackson's demand that South Africa be designated
a terrorist state.
   ``There are significant differences and they represent real
policy disagreements,'' Dach said. ``But they trust each other and
they share a common goal. ... We want his support. It's obviously
critical support.''

   The High Court refused requests Friday to
release three people held under the Internal Security Act after
they were charged with being Marxist conspirators against the
government.
   Justice Lai Kew Chai said Home Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar had
acted properly in authorizing the detentions of Kevin De Souza,
Wong Souk Kee and Chng Suan Tze, and that there was no evidence of
bad faith.
   They were arrested last year and released soon afterward, but
picked up again April 19. The Internal Security Act allows the
government to detain a person without trial for two years,
renewable indefinitely.
   In a statement issued April 18, the day before the second
arrest, all three said they were forced to confess and were
mistreated in detention. They denied being Marxist conspirators.
   Officials have not given reasons for rearresting them, but said
their statement ``was a political propaganda ploy to discredit the
government.''

<HEAD>Edwards Sentenced To Death In Stephen Small Kidnapping, Death</HEAD>

   A 31-year-old man was sentenced to death
Friday for the kidnapping and murder of a businessman who was
buried alive last September and suffocated before his family could
pay a $1 million ransom.
   Jurors deliberated less than an hour before voting death for
Daniel J. Edwards of Bourbonnais, who was convicted Monday in
Stephen Small's death. He showed no emotion when the penalty was
announced about 5:30 p.m.
   Prosecutor Frank Nowicki told jurors that Edwards' cruelty
demanded the death penalty, and asked jurors if they could imagine
``a worse way to die,'' as he stood before the homemade wooden box
in which Small's body was found.
   ``Imagine Stephen Small when that lid closed ... his life coming
to an end,'' Nowicki said. ``Imagine the panic he felt, the
helplessness ... to claw, to scrape, to scratch.''
   Edwards' live-in girlfriend, Nancy D. Rish, 26, also is charged
with murder and kidnapping and is awaiting trial. Edwards'
execution date would be set at a hearing later.
   Members of Small's family, including his wife, Nancy, were
immediately escorted from the packed courtroom.
   The jury, which had been selected in Rockford because of
pre-trial publicity in Kankakee, also was escorted from the
courtroom. Police said jurors did not want to talk with reporters.
   Small, 40, was lured from his home Sept. 2, 1987, and calls
demanding a $1 million ransom were made to his family. But the
family could not understand the tape-recorded instructions for
delivering the cash.
   Edwards and Ms. Rish were arrested two days later, the same day
police dug up Small's body from the box in which he was buried in
woods near Kankakee.
   Defense attorney Thomas Allen said there was ``some character''
in Edwards and asked the jury to spare his life. ``Danny's not
doing it to himself. You have to go back there and take a pen in
hand and sign'' the penalty, he said.
   During the death penalty hearing that began Wednesday,
prosecutors presented witnesses who described Edwards' use and sale
of drugs, and a letter he wrote to Mrs. Small and had smuggled out
of the county jail.
   It expressed ``condolences'' and said Small was not meant to
die, but demanded the Small family pay ``a blood debt.''
   The jurors convicted Edwards after listening chilling
tape-recordings of Small saying his kidnapper had put him in a
``grave'' where he would die unless the ransom was paid quickly.
   ``I ain't coming back to dig you back up,'' Small's kidnapper
was heard telling him on the tape, ``... and it's gonna get real
stuffy in here.''
   Small was the great-grandson of former Illinois Gov. Len Small.
He was former vice president of Mid America Media, a group that
owned radio and cable television stations, until the company was
sold in 1986.

   A three-judge panel on this southern
Caribbean island on Friday ordered a Colombian man extradited to
the United States on cocaine trafficking charges.
   Alvaro Triana Murillo, arrested May 16 and held at the request
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, was put aboard a
private plane following his two-hour appearance in court, officials
said in the capital.
   Chief of Police Roland Peterson refused to disclose the plane's
destination, citing security reasons. But Greg Keheo, assistant
U.S. attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said in a telephone
interview that Triana was being taken to Fort Lauderdale.
   Prosecutor Florencio Wernet told the judges Triana was indicted
by a grand jury in Florida on drug charges.
   Keheo said Triana, 37, faces charges involving the smuggling of
cocaine between 1980 and 1984.
   A spokesman for the DEA office in Miami said Triana ``is a
fugitive out of Fort Lauderdale.''
   Triana, who argued his arrest was a case of mistaken identity,
was held under tight security on this self-governing member of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands, located in the lower Caribbean Sea
about 20 miles off the coast of Venezuela.
   Triana told the three judges he exported automobile parts from
Colombia.
   ``I am innocent,'' he said. ``My misfortune was being born in
Colombia.''
   He left the courtroom in tears.
   Triana's lawyers said the man the DEA really wants is Alvaro
Triana Rodriguez, not their client.
   The judges, who had deliberated several hours, recommended to
Gov. Felipe Tromp that there was sufficient evidence to extradite.
   No U.S. officials attended the hearing.
   While Triana was taken to court, Dutch soldiers were positioned
at the prison and a nearby school was closed. The frigate Van
Kinsbergen patrolled the seas off the island.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis said Friday the Reagan administration ``can't say
no to Noriega,'' and he said the CIA once was ``paying off''
Panama's military leader to the tune of $200,000 a year.
   ``We've been paying that guy what we pay the president of the
United States,'' Dukakis said.
   ``You can't be serious about waging a real war against drugs
when we have an administration that can't say no to Noriega,'' he
said, referring to Gen. Manuel Noriega, who is under U.S.
indictment on drug charges.
   The Massachusetts governor hammered away at the issue of drugs
and U.S. foreign policy as he campaigned across the Southwest on a
trip designed to close out the Democratic primary season on a
winning note and begin pointing the party toward the fall campaign.
   New Mexico holds its primary on June 7 and Dukakis is expected
to win enough Democratic National Convention delegates here and in
primaries the same day in California, Montana and New Jersey to
clinch the party's nomination over Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson, too, was campaigning in New Mexico on Friday, and the
two Democrats met briefly at the Albuquerque airport. They emerged
smiling from a private session that lasted about five minutes.
Aides would not discuss what they had said.
   From New Mexico, where he addressed a meeting of Democratic
women and then spoke before a sun-drenched outdoor rally, Dukakis
headed for Texas, where he attended a barbeque with the state
Democratic hierarchy in a continuation of the attempt to pull the
party together at the end of the long nominating campaign.
   Dukakis won the Texas primary, but with less than 50 percent of
the vote in a multiple-candidate race and without broad backing
from party leaders.
   On Friday in New Mexico, the Massachusetts governor noted that
polls show him leading Vice President George Bush, the
all-but-certain Republican nominee, and said Democrats have the
best chance to win the presidency in years.
   ``I've never seen our party so united,'' he said. ``I've never
seen our party so together.''
   Even so, the ever-cautious Dukakis cautioned one audience to
guard against overconfidence, noting that he once was defeated for
re-election in Massachusetts after holding a 50-point lead in the
polls.
   His comments about Noriega represented a continuation of
Dukakis' attack against the Reagan administration's handling of
negotiations with the Panamanian leader.
   ``This is an administration that can't say no to drugs and drug
peddlers, funneling aid to the Contras and convicted drug dealers
that are doing time in federal penitentiaries, the CIA links with
drug trafficking and drug profiteering in the United States of
America,'' Dukakis said.
   He said either President Reagan, Bush or ``somebody in this
administration'' should provide an explanation of alleged CIA ties
to the Panamanian.
   ``It's been paying off Noriega $200,000 a year. We've been
paying that guy what we pay the president of the United States.''
   He said the administration should explain publicly ``who was
doing business with Noriega and why we were doing business with
Noriega.''
   Dukakis said the $200,000 figure emerged from congressional
hearings into Noriega's alleged links with the CIA.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Friday
blamed U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and the State Department's
Elliott Abrams for the breakdown in recent talks on the general's
political future.
   Noriega, who as head of the armed forces is the de facto leader
of Panama, also said he held the Reagan administration responsible
for his personal safety.
   He told a women's convention, ``I place responsibility for the
life of Manuel Antonio Noriega with the establishment of the United
States. I hold the establishment responsible for the life of this
son of God.''
   The United States has been trying to force Noriega to leave as
head of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces since he was indicted
by U.S. grand juries in Florida in February as a major drug
trafficker and money-launderer.
   On Wednesday, U.S. officials announced that their talks with
Panama to resolve the struggle over Noriega's leadership had fallen
apart. Secretary of State George P. Shultz blamed the collapse on
Noriega.
   The general did not elaborate on his charges Friday that Davis
and Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, were responsible for the breakdown of the talks.
   But he called for ``foreign forces'' to leave Panama and for the
United States to ``leave Panama in peace. Sirs, for God's sake
leave it in peace.''
   Besides the Panama Canal, the United States also has its
Southern Command in Panama, with overall responsibility for U.S.
military operations in a wide swath of Latin America. About 10,000
U.S. troops with about 20,000 military dependents are in Panama.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Eduardo Ritter, said Friday
Panama's relations with the United States are ``practically
nonexistent.''
   Ritter said relations were bad ``because the United States
maintains recognition of a government that doesn't exist.''
   Washington recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as Panama's legal
president, even though he was ousted in February after he tried to
fire Noriega as chief of Defense Forces. Noriega then installed
Manuel Solis Palma as president, and Delvalle has been in hiding
ever since.
   Delvalle said Friday he warned the United States in vain against
go-it-alone tactics in talks with Noriega. He also predicted
violence if Noriega doesn't leave.
   Delvalle said other Latin American democracies offered to help
and that they and the Panamanian opposition should have had a role.
   He met a small number of correspondents, including Associated
Press correspondent Joseph B. Frazier, at a location they agreed
not to disclose and told them:
   ``I have always thought that (the talks) were a ploy to delay
matters, to give (Noriega) time to strengthen his inner circle
within the ... Defense Forces and at the end, yes, to ridicule
President Reagan and the United States. ``I don't think (Noriega)
was sincere, and I told the (Reagan) administration that what
happened would happen. That wasn't very difficult. I told them
about three weeks ago,'' he added.
   Foreign Minister Ritter spoke at a news conference before
leaving for Cuba to attend a conference of non-aligned nations.
Ritter said he would use the Havana meeting to denounce what he
called aggression by the United States against Panama.
   He also said the Noriega discussions with the United States were
informal and did not involve the Foreign Ministry.
   But he added, ``I want to reiterate to you that the reason those
conversations didn't produce any result was the imposition by one
of the sides. That's what finished off the conversations.''
   He also said the government was evaluating damage to the
Panamanian economy as a result of U.S. sanctions imposed in an
effort to force Noriega from power. He said it was looking into
whether there is a basis for filing suit in the International Court
of Justice in Netherlands. A ruling in such a suit, however, would
be put into effect only if both parties agreed.
   Washington wants the general to leave the country and Delvalle
to return as president. In exchange, the United States would lift
economic sanctions and possibly drop the drug charges.
   Noriega also blamed Washington on Thursday for the talks'
collapsing.
   ``The world must know that the conversation sustained with
President Reagan's envoy broke down when he presented us with an
ultimatum in which Panama had to accept immediately his last
offer,'' he told a packed session of the National Assembly.
   Asked then whether his resignation had been discussed, Noriega
replied: ``The commander doesn't abandon his ship in stormy
weather.''

   Deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle said from hiding on Friday that he warned the United
States in vain against go-it-alone tactics in talks with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   He also predicted violence if Noriega doesn't leave.
   Delvalle said other Latin American democracies offered to help
and that they and the Panamanian opposition should have had a role.
   He has been in hiding since his ouster in late February. He met
with a few correspondents Friday morning at a location the
journalists agreed not to disclose.
   On Wednesday, U.S. officials announced that their talks with
Panama to resolve the struggle over Noriega's leadership had fallen
apart. Secretary of State George P. Shultz blamed the collapse on
Noriega.
   Noriega, the de facto leader of Panama as head of the nation's
15,000-member military and police forces, is under indictment in
the United States as a drug trafficker.
   ``I have always thought that (the talks) were a ploy to delay
matters, to give (Noriega) time to strengthen his inner circle
within the Panamanian Defense Forces and at the end, yes, to
ridicule President Reagan and the United States,'' Delvalle said.
   ``I don't think (Noriega) was sincere, and I told the ( Reagan)
administration that what happened would happen. That wasn't very
difficult. I told them about three weeks ago,'' he said.
   ``I am disappointed at the fact that they did not use to their
advantage our knowledge of Noriega,'' Delvalle said, adding that it
is time for the United States to let Latin American nations take
the lead, a move the administration now is exploring.
   Delvalle was vice president and assumed power when President
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, elected by a 1,700-vote edge in 1984, was
ousted in September 1985.
   Delvalle was forced out by Noriega last February after he tried
to fire the general. The United States still recogizes Delvalle as
president.
   He said he has not left Panama since being deposed and that he
is not hiding ``on any military base or in any embassy.''
   What his priority is in any deal that may lead to Noriega's
removal from power is not clear.
   Arrest warrants have been out for him for two months but the
Noriega government is making no apparent serious attempt to find
him.
   Asked if there were circumstances under which he might renounce
his claim, Delvalle responded: ``Why should I? This is one of the
basic factors, respect for the constitution by the military.
   ``All over Latin American there has been a clear, loud message
that (the military) is below civilian government,'' he said.
   Delvalle said Panamanians are not used to street violence but it
could start if Noriega remains and the economy keeps going downhill.
   ``Economic pressures are building up and he knows it,'' Delvalle
said of Noriega.
   ``I think we will be facing violence in the near future,'' he
said. ``The people of Panama are getting desperate. We will see
some violent demonstrations here in the next few days or weeks.''
   Violent street protests have occurred sporadically since last
June, but have halted in what generally is attributed to the
military's successful crackdown and the opposition's difficulty in
mustering support.

<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ More than 20,000 children in
the north are boycotting classes to protest the presence of South
African military bases near schools, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The Namibian, a weekly paper that supports the South-West
African People's Organization guerrilla movement known as SWAPO,
said the boycott had spread to 20 secondary schools and 15 primary
schools in the territory, also called Namibia.
   It began early this month after South Africa's chief
representative, Louis Peinaar, refused to remove an army base next
to the Ponhofi school in the northern region of Ovambo. He said
bomb shelters were being built at the school to provide protection
in the event of guerrilla bombardments of the base.
   Peter Kalangula, chairman of the Ovambo administrative council,
said the South African refusal to move bases away from Ponhofi and
a few other schools ``is creating hatred against the security
forces.''
   South Africa controls Namibia in defiance of U.N. resolutions
calling for independence. South Africa says it will not grant
independence until Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola,
where SWAPO guerrillas have maintained bases during their
22-year-old bush war.

   Vietnamese officials and the the U.N. refugee
agency began their annual meeting Friday, months earlier than usual
following a sharp increase in the number of ``boat people'' fleeing
Indochina.
   According to the agency, 10,628 boat people were registered in
the region in the first four months of this year and the May figure
is expected to top 4,000.
   Among topics to be discussed with a four-member Vietnamese
delegation led by vice foreign minister Ha Van Lau, who also is
ambassador to France, is the 9-year-old Orderly Departure Program,
said Judith Kumin, spokeswoman for the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   The meeting normally occurs in autumn.
   Arrivals in Hong Kong increased from 798 in January through
March to 1,381 in April and 1,596 in the first two weeks of May,
Ms. Kumin told a weekly U.N. news briefing.
   She said it was the highest level since 1979. Arrivals in
Malaysia also are above average, with 2,917 in the first quarter of
1988 and 1,904 in April, she said.
   The Orderly Departure Program was negotiated to give Vietnamese
with relatives living abroad a safe, legal alternative to the risks
of fleeing their country by land or by sea as boat people. It has
enabled more than 136,000 Indochinese refugees to resettle in 24
countries since June 1979, Ms. Kumin said.
   Most refugees have gone to the United States and Canada, she
said, and gave the numbers as 65,176 and 24,615 respectively.
   In 1984, the United States called for expansion of the program
by offering to admit all Amerasian children _ most of whose fathers
were U.S. servicemen _ and their close relatives, as well as
political prisoners and their close family members.
   Ms. Kumin said the Amerasian question also was on the agenda of
the annual meeting, scheduled to end Tuesday.

<HEAD>Report: Remains Found In Mass Grave Older Than World War II</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts analyzing remains found in
a mass grave believe the bones may be almost two centuries old and
not of World War II Nazi concentration camp victims, the news
agency CTK said Friday.
   The state-run agency said new evidence indicates the remains may
have been buried in northwestern Czechoslovakia under the reign of
Joseph II, who held power in the region in the late 18th century.
   CTK said the emperor had ordered that corpses be reburied
outside municipal limits to prevent disease.
   The remains were found May 19 during work in a quarry near the
town of Most, about 50 miles northwest of Prague.
   Archeologists had speculated that the remains could have either
been those of death camp inmates killed by the Nazis or victims of
Allied bombing attacks.
   ``The remains ... originally believed to come from the World War
II period have been subject to ... (testing) which showed that they
probably come from the period of the reign of Joseph II,'' CTK said.
   The news agency did not provide sources for the report and did
not elaborate.
   But an official of the Most District Museum, which is in charge
of the project, told The Associated Press the remains come from the
time of Joseph II or the Napoleonic wars.
   ``I talked to people here who remember the end of World War II
and no one recalled anything like this,'' said Libuse Pokorna.
   She said it was impossible to immediately estimate the number of
the dead buried in the grave.
   Pokorna said final results from the tests could take a month.

<HEAD>Woman Returns to Letterman House After He Refuses to Prosecute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW CANAAN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was arrested driving David
Letterman's sports car and claiming she was his wife was arrested
again after police found her inside the suburban home of the TV
talk show host, authorities said Friday.
   Margaret M. Ray, 36, of no known address, was arrested Thursday
night and arraigned Friday in Norwalk Superior Court on two counts
of second-degree burglary and first-degree larcency, authorities
said.
   She entered no plea and was ordered held on $25,000 bail pending
a June 15 court appearance.
   Her second arrest came after a cab driver tipped police that he
had just driven her from the local train station to Letterman's
house _ a day after New Jersey prosecutors dropped charges from her
first arrest, Capt. Michael Angelastro said.
   ``It's very difficult at this time to explain her behavior based
on what we know,'' Angelastro said. ``We don't know where she is
from. We are trying to determine that.''
   Ms. Ray first was arrested Sunday at the Lincoln Tunnel as she
drove the blue, 1988 Porsche Carrera into New York from New Jersey
with a 3-year-old passenger. She didn't have the $3 toll,
authorities said.
   ``I'm Mrs. David Letterman and this is David Jr.,'' Ms. Ray was
reported by authorities to have told the toll collector. ``Don't
you think David Letterman is good for the toll?''
   The child was put into the custody of New Jersey juvenile
authorities.
   Although Letterman decided not to press charges after Sunday's
incident, authorities will prosecute the woman on the latest
charges regardless of the entertainer's wishes, Angelastro said.
   ``She had no right being in the house and we took firm action
against her when we found out she had entered the house last
night,'' he said.
   After Sunday's arrest, New Canaan police alerted by Port
Authority officials found signs that someone, apparently Ms. Ray,
had broken into Letterman's modest, two-story house through a
living room window, Angelastro said.
   Furniture, plants and a rug had been moved around and there were
dirty dishes in the sink, he said.
   Ms. Ray apparently entered the house through the same living
room window again Thursday night, Angelastro said. She didn't
repeat her claim that she was Letterman's wife, he said.
   Letterman, the gap-toothed host of ``Late Night with David
Letterman,'' was reached by police in Los Angeles, where he has
been staying.
   Although Angelastro said Ms. Ray has made no threatening remarks
about Letterman, he believed Letterman was concerned about the
incidents. ``I'm sure this matter is of great concern to him,'' he
said.
   After Sunday's arrest, Letterman told authorities he didn't know
the woman and that she didn't have permission to drive her car.
   Authorities said that after identifying herself Sunday as Mrs.
Letterman, Ms. Ray then called herself Jane Doe, Margaret Ray and
finally Mary Ray. Angelastro said police found documents indicating
her correct name is Margaret M. Ray.
   A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family
Services DYFS said Friday she could not discuss the child's
whereabouts because of New Jersey confidentialy laws.
   Jack Rollins, Letterman's agent, was not in his office Friday
afternoon and was unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said.

   Greece and Turkey pledged Friday to
cool tensions in the Aegean Sea region and continue a gradual
improvement in relations between the once-hostile NATO allies.
   Foreign Ministers Carolos Papoulias of Greece and Mesut Yilmaz
of Turkey told a joint news conference that four days of talks this
week on political cooperation ended ``positively.''
   ``The first steps we have made here are modest but encouraging.
... I believe that we are duty-bound to succeed in our future
efforts as well,'' Yilmaz told reporters before leaving for Turkey.
   Both countries agreed to avoid staging military maneuvers in the
Aegean Sea during holidays and the summer tourist season.
   Greece and Turkey monitor each other's military exercises in the
region and fighter pilots often stage mock dogfights over the
Aegean.
   Greece has often protested alleged harrassment by Turkish
fighters of Olympic Airways passenger jets flying tourists to the
Aegean islands.
   The talks this week preceded a scheduled June 13-15 visit to
Athens by Premier Turgut Ozal of Turkey.
   Ozal and Premier Andreas Papandreou of Greece agreed to avoid
confrontation and boost bilateral relations during a January
meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
   Greece and Turkey have longstanding disputes over control of
Aegean airspace, the military status of some Greek islands and the
divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   In March 1987, they came to the brink of war over seabed oil
drilling rights.
   But Papoulias said the ministers delayed discussion of ``large
issues'' such as the presence of Turkish troops on Cyprus for
Ozal's visit.
   The officials abolished abolished visa rules for diplomats in
each other's capitals and agreed to continue talks on cooperation
against narcotics, smuggling and terrorism.

<HEAD>Firefighter Fatalities Up; Heart Attack Still Number One Killer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUINCY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of firefighters who died in the
line of duty hit a seven-year high last year, with heart attacks
again claiming the most lives, a national safety organization
reported Friday.
   The National Fire Protection Association reported 124 fatalities
in 1987, a 9.7 percent increase over the previous year and the most
since 1981, when 134 firefighters died.
   There were 72 volunteers and 52 career firefighters among the
1987 fatalities, according to the non-profit group that claims more
than 44,000 members nationwide.
   Overall, heart attacks continued to be the number one killer,
striking down 56 firefighters, the group said.
   Other major causes of fatalities included internal trauma, 28
deaths; asphyxiation, 13 deaths; and crushing, 12 deaths.
   Of the heart attack victims, 14 had prior heart problems; 10 had
severe heart disease; two suffered from hypertension and one was
fatigued prior to the attack. Heart attack has been the major cause
of firefighter fatalities since the study began 11 years ago, the
group said.
   While the number of fatal heart attacks among firefighters over
40 years old was down 16 percent from the previous year, the
numbers were slightly higher among younger firefighters. There were
five fatal heart attack victims under 35 years old, including two
under 20.
   Fifty-three firefighters were killed while fighting fires, with
24 dying from heart attacks, 10 from internal trauma, eight from
smoke inhalation, six from being crushed, two from burns, two from
gunshot wounds and one from electrocution.
   Thirty-five firefighters were killed while responding to or
returning from an alarm.
   For the first time since the association began issuing the
report, the largest proportion of deaths in the line of duty
occurred during wildland fires. Seventeen firefighters were killed
battling such blazes, while five died responding to or returning
from wildland fires.
   Fires of suspicious origins accounted for 23 deaths, according
to the statistics.

<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old woman was arrested Friday after the
dismembered body of her boyfriend was found on the living room
floor of her north Capitol Hill apartment, police said.
   Lori McLuckie of Denver was jailed for investigation of
first-degree murder. The victim's identity was not released by
authorities.
   Detective Calvin Hemphill said police were called to the
apartment Friday on a tip and found the victim's torso and head on
a piece of plastic on the floor.
   A search turned up the victim's limbs, wrapped in plastic bags
and deposited in several dumpsters in the neighborhood.
   All body parts were found except for the victim's left foot and
a piece of his right thigh, Hemphill said.
   ``It looks like he may have been dead since last Saturday,''
Hemphill said.
   Police said they had found the tool used to carve up the body,
but they weren't saying what it was. The victim also showed signs
of multiple stab wounds, police said.
   Hemphill said McLuckie apparently had been carrying on her
normal routine and had continued living in the apartment since the
victim's death. She was roused from bed by police executing a
search warrant early Friday.
   A neighbor said he had noticed nothing unusual except for a foul
smell emanating from the apartment the last few days.

   An entertainer whose 2-year-old daughter
was mauled to death by a leopard used in his act said Friday that
her death was an act of fate.
   ``We have no choice over life or death,'' Joe Savage said at a
news conference. ``The cage that was involved in this was locked
... how and why this happened is nothing short of mystical.''
   Nikka, daughter of Savage and his girlfriend, Kimberly Wilson,
died of head wounds, blood loss and shock after the attack
Wednesday, doctors said.
   The leopard, Tabu, got out of its cage outside Savage's farm
house in suburban Nashville and mauled the child.
   The cat was tranquilized after the attack and died a short time
later while being taken for a 10-day quarantine to the Tennessee
Wildlife Resources Agency Center.
   ``I think that he (God) protected her from growing up in this
world, this society that is worse than any Amazon jungle,'' Savage
said.
   Savage flew to Nashville Thursday from Las Vegas where he was
performing. He leads a touring rock `n' roll act in which he sings
and performs with pythons and leopards.
   Police said the attack was an accident and didn't anticipate any
charges.
   Savage's older daughter, Julie Saccio, 24, said in a telephone
interview from her home in Charlotte, N.C., that she has taken care
of her father's five leopards occasionally but feared only Tabu.
   Ms. Saccio, who said her father legally changed his name for
show business reasons about 15 years ago, said she took care of the
leopards most recently in January and February.
   ``The black ones (leopards) were pretty tame. It was just Tabu _
my dad raised Tabu with a Rottweiler, and after that dog was killed
in California, that cat went nuts,'' Ms. Saccio said.
   ``My dad was the only one who could get around it.''
   Ms. Saccio said she lives with her mother, Emily Saccio, and
that she has a brother, Joey, also in his 20s.
   Police Chief Joe Casey said authorities think Ms. Wilson left
Nikka outside for a moment while she went into the house, ``and
when she came out, the cat was on the kid.''
   Four other cats also escaped from the cage but police and
wildlife officials herded them back in.
   Ms. Saccio said she didn't know how the cats could have gotten
loose.
   ``The fences were tightly secured. That's why I thought maybe
she (Ms. Wilson) had cleaned the cage or fed them, then left it
unlocked,'' Ms. Saccio said. ``These animals are very smart.
Leopards can turn a knob.''

   A rebel military leader turned himself
in to the leftist government and said Friday he will try to bring
the 400 Contras formerly under his command out of the mountains.
   Felix Garcia Hernandez, alias Commander Alfa Lima, 26, told
reporters Friday he had decided to quit the U.S.-supported
insurgency on Wednesday and take advantage of the Sandinista
government's amnesty program.
   Alfa Lima, a former evangelical preacher before he took up arms
against the government, spoke to reporters accompanied by
Sandinista officials.
   His acceptance of the amnesty coincided with the third round of
high-level peace talks in Managua between the government and a
Contra delegation that included his former commander-in-chief,
Enrique Bermudez.
   ``We regret it,'' Bermudez said upon learning of Alfa Lima's
decision. ``He was a field commander with a long record. We
consider him a war casualty.''
   The Nicaraguan government considered Alfa Lima one of the most
effective Contra field commanders. He had led a special military
task force in central Chontales province since 1984.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Alfa Lima said his
decision followed a series of talks with his troops and with
Sandinista Army soldiers during the provisional truce that went
into effect April 1.
   ``We sat in this farm in Chontales and we talked about how we
Nicaraguans were killing each other,'' Alfa Lima said. ``We talked
about how we wanted peace.''
   The Contras took up arms against the Sandinistas in November
1981.
   On Wednesday, he and six of his men abandoned their camp in
Chontales.
   ``We had many problems,'' he said. ``I had more than 400 men
under my command. Since February we had trouble getting supplies.
We would ask the command in Honduras for supplies and then the
planes supposedly would come from the Honduran bases. But the
commanders refused to supply us. They were hoarding everything
since the truce started.''
   Alfa Lima said he hoped to encourage more of his former Contra
troops to take advantage of the amnesty.
   ``I am going to try to convince my men to come in. There are
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are
fighting,'' said the soft-spoken Alfa Lima, still wearing his
camouflage uniform.
   ``Many of them are people separated from society. They say they
fight for democracy, for freedom, because they were told that, but
they don't really know,'' he said.
   ``I am going to show them that there are guarantees,'' he added.
   Under the program the government enacted in 1985, rebels may lay
down their arms and return to normal life in Nicaragua without fear
of reprisal.
   Alfa Lima said he joined the Contras in 1982 after he was
threatened and harassed by a Sandinista Army officer while he
served as an evangelical pastor in his native Jinotega province.

   After a week in which New York City teachers
were bludgeoned, slashed, pummeled and blasted, their union leader
called Friday for increased security and tougher sentences for
teacher assaults.
   ``One attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four in
one week is just intolerable,'' said United Federation of Teachers
President Sandra Feldman. ``And we're afraid that this is just the
tip of the iceberg.''
   Though schools officials insisted the number of attacks on
teachers had actually decreased in three years, Mayor Edward I.
Koch said the city was concerned about teacher safety and he called
a ``summit meeting'' Tuesday of the chancellor, union leaders, the
five district attorneys and police commissioner to discuss the
problem.
   The latest act of violence occurred Thursday afternoon when a
physical education teacher came upon an intruder rifling through
students' gym bags outside a Bronx school and was beaten
unconscious with a baseball bat.
   Gary Smith, 37, who remained unconscious Friday, was the fourth
teacher assaulted. Douglas De Marco was knifed Monday more than a
dozen times by a mugger in the bathroom of a South Bronx grammar
school.
   The other incidents included a Brooklyn teacher who was beaten
up by a student, the student's brother and sister Tuesday, and a
71-year-old Brooklyn teacher injured Wednesday by an M-80
firecracker tossed into her classroom.
   All the victims except Smith were in good condition Friday,
officials said.
   ``There's something seriously wrong here,'' said De Marco, who
added that the attack on Smith made him even more ``angry and
frustrated.''
   The need for increased security has long been evident to De
Marco who said he teaches in ``a neighborhood that's known for two
things: heroin and crack.''
   De Marco, speaking from his hospital bed, said his attacker was
``some young crazed guy, looking to make a quick score.''
   The assailant got a few subway tokens and a couple of dollars;
De Marco got kicked in the ribs, abdomen and groin and stabbed in
the ear, neck, shoulder, side and back.
   ``A few more inches and it could have been my eye or an artery
and we wouldn't be having this conversation,'' said De Marco, who
is expected to recover.
   Yet the Board of Education said the number of assaults in city
schools have decreased, mainly because of an increase in security
guards in elementary schools.
   There were 1,322 assaults in the city's 1,000 schools in 1985-86
and 969 this year, said board spokesman Bob Terte.
   That included 337 teachers assaulted in 1985-86 and 198 so far
this year, he said. The rest were on students or other personnel
including custodians and cafeteria workers. An assault could be
anything beginning with a shove against a wall, Terte said.
   In addition, Terte said 350 security guards have been added in
the last two years, and the operating budget for school safety
increased from $31.8 million to nearly $43.2 million. There are
currently 2,081 guards in schools.
   But the UFT insists there were about 1,000 physical attacks
against teachers both last year and this year. Edward Muir,
chairman of the UFT School Safety Committee, said about 20 percent
required emergency-room treatment.
   Though Ms. Feldman acknowledged a decrease in teacher assaults
and a rise in security personnel, she said ``it's obviously not
good enough.''
   ``If we have four incidents in one week and if we have a
situation where a teacher can be bludgeoned this way in a school
yard while he's teaching kids, then obviously the efforts, and I do
acknowledge the effort, isn't enough.''
   She praised new schools Chancellor Richard Green for his
proposal to put metal detectors in five violence-prone schools this
fall and said she felt he was anxious to stem violence.
   But she said the changes can't come quick enough.
   The UFT wants guards in every school and police officers in
troubled neighborhoods. The union also is pushing for legislation
to make any physical attack on a teacher a felony offense, no
matter how minor. A bill is pending in the state Senate.
   Ms. Feldman said that too often if the defendant is a minor
``nothing is done.''
   ``It's already difficult to get teachers into the school
system'' without adding problems like these, Ms. Feldman said. She
said about half the system's 63,000 teachers are eligible to retire
and these incidents are likely to prompt some to say, ``Look, I've
had it.''
   Douglas De Marco, however, is not one of them.
   ``I look around this room and see all the letters and pictures
the kids sent me and there is no way I can't go back,'' he said.

   A Sweet Home Shoe House playset and Ice Cream
Doll are being recalled nationwide because they may pose a choking
hazard to small children, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced Friday.
   About 6,500 of the Sweet Home Shoe House playsets were sold
across the country, the agency said. It described them as a plastic
house in the shape of a workboot, containing 18 pieces of dolls and
doll furniture. The set sold for about $5 and is labeled ``1984
Jumbos International (Hong Kong) Co. No. 698.''
   In addition, some 7,800 of the Ice Cream Doll were sold for
about $3 each, the commission said. These are soft dolls with a
plastic ice cream cone suspended around the neck. They are labeled
``Ice Cream Doll, Made in Hong Kong.''
   No injuries have been reported involving the toys, but both
contain small parts which could pose a choking hazard, the
commission said. Parents were urged to remove the toys from
children's use and to return them to the retailer for a refund.
   The toys were recalled by Wisconsin Toy Company Inc. of New
York, the commission said. Consumers needing more information may
call the Safety Commission at 1-800-638-2772.

   A man hailed as a hero for saving a family from
their burning building has acknowledged lying when he told people
afterward that he was a Vietnam veteran and that he had only a
minor criminal record.
   Some of the people helping him say it doesn't matter.
   Offers of aid have poured in for Rikka Pash, 42, since news
accounts of his saving a mother and her six young children from
their burning apartment building a week ago, according to a social
worker and his employer.
   Pash lied when he told reporters after the fire that he was a
Vietnam veteran and that he had served only one year in prison for
cashing a Social Security check illegally, according to a published
report.
   In truth, Pash admitted he never joined the Army as he said, and
admitted he had served several years in prison on violations
ranging from auto theft to parole violations, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported Friday.
   Pash could not be reached for comment. His employer said he was
still recuperating from a gash suffered in the fire and he was not
at a hotel that offered him lodging Friday afternoon, the manager
said.
   Joanne Parker, a social worker who has been helping Pash through
the Safer Foundation, a non-profit group that assists ex-offenders,
said money sent to her by a veterans group would be returned.
   Ronald Podeszwa, Pash's boss at Deluxe Golf Repair Shop, said he
would also return checks to their senders, but the situation would
not endanger Pash's employment there.
   Both said they would continue to help Pash.
   The fire consumed all of Pash's belongings and about $150 he had
saved, Pash and Miss Parker said earlier this week.
   Hotel Lincoln on the city's North Side has offered him a place
to stay for a week or two, and the new revelations will not prompt
withdrawal of the offer, said Manager Dede Bennett.
   ``The owner of the hotel was already aware of this,'' Mrs.
Bennett said. ``He was just trying to help someone who's trying to
change his life.''
   Pash told the Sun-Times Thursday he does not want money and that
people who want contributions returned to them at the hotel or the
foundation.
   ``I have a place to live,'' he said. ``I'm trying to leave my
past behind me, and to go forward in life. I want to thank people
for all their willingness to help me.''

<HEAD>Western Allies Brush Off Soviet Worries Over U.S. Militarization

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Trusteeship Council on Friday
brushed off Soviet warnings of impending U.S. militarization of the
South Pacific territory of Palau and approved progress toward
Palau's adopting a Compact of Free Association with America.
   Britain, France and the United States voted in favor of a report
urging approval of the compact and recommending that any disputes
in interpretion be resolved between Palau and America. The Soviet
Union voted against the report.
   Soviet delegate Dmitri V. Bykov also said the report failed to
mention racism in the South Pacific. The British delegate, J.
Stephen Smith, had accused the Soviets on Thursday of ``trying to
make twisted allegations of racism where none existed.''
   Bykov said Thursday that America's true intention was to
``dominate the people of the Trust Territory in order to maintain
United States strategic dominance in the area.'' He accused the
United States of ``planning to continue to strengthen and broaden
test areas for missile technology and other military bases'' in the
region.
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Bryne retorted that
``contrary to the assertions of a few, the United States has not
turned the Trust Territory into a military base ... and has no
intention of doing so. Those who condemn the `militarization' of
Micronesia seek to mislead the world in order to advance their own
agenda in the region.''
   The Soviets have sought in recent years to negotiate fishing
rights with several South Pacific island nations. Since World War
II, the region had been mainly regarded as an American preserve
free of Soviet influence.
   In March, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs
of staff, told the House Foreign Affairs Committtee that Palau
would be ``one of the first ... areas that we would have to look
at'' if America could no longer keep military bases in the
Philippines, where treaty rights are under renegotiation.
   The United States has administered Palau under a U.N.
trusteeship since World War II, when U.S. forces drove Japanese
occupiers from the region.
   The Compact of Free Association for Palau would grant the group
of islands self-government in economic, social and educational
affairs. The Palau Islands, with a population of about 12,000, are
located about 500 miles east of the Philippine island of Mindanao.
   In April, a court in Palau invalidated a 1987 referendum in
which 73 percent of the voters approved the compact, ruling that a
75 percent majority was required to adopt it. Palau's government is
expect to appeal the ruling.
   Moscow says the U.N Security Council can dissolve the
trusteeship.

<TEXT>
   Beef and pork have disappeared from
meat counters throughout communist Yugoslavia as a new wave of
shortages hit the country, a federal market inspectors' report to
the government said Friday.
   Coffee was reported in sparse supply in some parts and cleaning
powder can only be bought on and off, the Belgrade daily Politika
quoted as saying in their report.
   Other staples in short supply included butter, car tires, cement
and some construction materials.
   Most Yugoslavs have been reported on a mass shopping spree in
recent weeks in anticipation of steep price rises expected when a
government price freeze ends next month.
   The new austerity program, aimed at curbing Europe's highest
inflation and repaying a $20 billion foreign debt, provides for
further wage cuts and widespread price increases.
   The measures were originally due to start May 15 but were put
off until June because new loans from Western creditors failed to
materialize.
   The economic package is intended to reduce wages of Yugoslavs by
up to 30 percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers
announced new, higher prices for their products after the price
freeze expires.
   Slovenian furniture manufacturers have already announced price
increases of up to 80 percent and those of electric ware and paper
products of up to 100 percent after the 6{-month freeze is lifted.
   To cope with the meat shortage, the government announced it was
making available 20,000 tons of meat from emergency reserves.
   Bozidar Komadinic, director general of Centroproizvod company,
said there was little hope that coffee will be available in
Belgrade or Serbia any time soon, Politika reported.

   A spectacular fire destroyed
restaurants and shops on the popular Redondo Beach Pier on Friday,
chasing away thousands of people and destroying much of the
structure.
   Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the blaze,
said fire Battalion Chief Pat Aust. Damage was estimated at more
than $1 million.
   Aust termed the fire ``completely accidental,'' based on a
eyewitness accounts, but he would not elaborate.
   The fire, reported about 1:40 p.m., sent plumes of smoke and
flame billowing into the sky over this resort city 25 miles south
of downtown Los Angeles. The smoke was visible for 10 miles.
   Aust said flammable creosote used as a preservative on the
pilings produced a noxious gas, adding to the problems of
firefighters who could not get to the flames spreading beneath the
pier.
   Firefighters from six cities fought the blaze for more than 3{
hours from the shore and in small boats, and poured water onto
smouldering pilings even after the fire was declared out around
4:30 p.m.
   The fire apparently started in The Breakers restaurant, which
was closed at the time, and spread to several other buildings on
the pier, officials said.
   About 40 patrons were evacuated without incident from The Edge
restaurant nearby. Three shops were destroyed along with the two
restaurants, authorities said.
   Severe storms last winter caused between $30 million and $40
million damage on and around the pier, and on Jan. 31, opne person
was killed and nine others were injured when a steel grate atop a
parking structure collapsed.

   An Ohio prison inmate who took two
guards hostage at gunpoint and fled in a rented Cadillac with his
wife and 9-year-old stepdaughter was captured Friday, crossing from
Mexico into El Paso, Texas.
   Michael Day, 31, of Athens, who escaped Sunday from the Ross
Correctional Institution in Chillicothe, was arrested without
incident about 6:30 p.m. EDT as he crossed the Santa Fe-Juarez
bridge, officials at the prison said.
   His wife, Sylvia Carraveo Day, had been arrested about 2 p.m. as
she crossed the same bridge, and Mrs. Day's daughter was also in
custody, the FBI's El Paso office said.
   Day and his wife were in the El Paso city jail Friday night and
will be arraigned Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate, authorities
said. The FBI, El Paso police and authorities from Ohio and Indiana
took part in the arrest.
   Day, serving an 18- to 25-year sentence for burglary and othger
felonies, escaped with a pistol officials said was sent to him in a
television set. Karen Albert, 29, of Athens was arrested and
charged Monday with sending the gun.
   Day took his two hostages in a prison jeep to a Holiday Inn
here, where his wife and stepdaughter waited with a getaway car. He
handcuffed one guard to the jeep and the other to a towel bar in a
room registered to his wife.
   A blue Cadillac that Mrs. Day rented Sunday night at the
Columbus Airport Sunday night was found Friday morning near the
international bridge, Ross Correctional spokeswoman Sandy Price
said.
   Authorities staked out the area near the car and waited for the
Days to return, Ms. Price said. She said authorities believe Mrs.
Day has relatives in Texas and possibly in Mexico.
   Ms. Price said the stepdaughter would be released to Mrs. Day's
parents.
   Day was convicted of attempted abduction, burglary, receiving
stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon after a felony
conviction, Ms. Price said.
   He had been at the Ross prison since June 1987 and had served at
the Chillicothe Correctional Institute and Ohio State Reformatory
in Mansfield since April 1985, and married while he was in prison.

   Stock prices plunged in Tokyo Saturday over rumors
that the United States may hike its official discount rate, traders
said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index, dropped 327.99 points or 1.2 percent during
Saturday's half-day session, closing at 26,962.50.
   Traders said rumors of a U.S. discount rate hike reduced stock
purchases, causing a decline in the market index.
   ``Speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may hike its
discount rate spread all over Kabuto-cho (Tokyo's financial
district),'' said a broker at a major securities firm. ``Investors
are assuming that the speculation is reliable after seeing the
higher-than-expected U.S. GNP growth rate figures for the first
quarter of the year, and as a result are selling shares,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported a 3.9 percent growth rate
in the gross national product during the first three months of the
year, higher than the earlier estimate of 2.3 percent.
   ``The upcoming long weekend in the U.S. made many investors
unwilling to participate in trading today,'' added another analyst
at a major securities firm, referring to the Memorial Day weekend
in the United States starting Saturday.
   The volume on the market's first section was 850 million shares.
   Tokyo's foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   In an unprecedented move, federal regulators
ordered the makers of the anti-acne medicine Accutane to warn
customers of potential birth defects by using a picture of a
deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   ``It is an attempt to emphasize to people that we're not talking
about a remote risk of some minor birth defect ... but a very high
risk of extremely severe birth defects that can, in effect, make
the child unable to function,'' says U.S. Food and Drug

   Among other requirements, the FDA will force female patients to

   If you live in New York, your chances of dying
from a heart attack may be twice as great as in New Mexico,
according to a study that finds ``significant'' geographic
differences in heart-disease death rates.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
heart-disease rates were generally highest in concentrated,
urbanized areas of the Northeast or Midwest, while the West had the
lowest rates.
   ``We're talking about thousands of deaths difference between the
low states and the high states,'' said Dr. Patrick L. Remington, a
CDC researcher.
   Heart disease is the leading killer in the United States, taking
more lives each year than all other causes combined, according to
the American Heart Association. In 1985, 540,800 Americans died of
ischemic, or blocked-artery, heart disease _ most commonly heart
attacks, according to CDC statistics.

   Congress is moving with unusual speed toward
final approval of a $1.1 trillion federal budget for the 1989
fiscal year, thanks to a little bipartisan cooperation and a lot of
creative arithmetic.
   The House approved the spending plan by a 201-181 vote on
Thursday shortly after House-Senate negotiators reached agreement
on a compromise document after six weeks of haggling.
   The Senate is expected to give quick approval to the measure
after the chamber returns early next month from its Memorial Day
recess.
   The budget meets the spending ceilings for domestic, defense and
international affairs programs set at last fall's budget summit by
President Reagan and congressional leaders.
   It also obeys the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's $146
billion deficit target for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. If the
red ink grows beyond that level, the law calls for automatic
spending cuts to reduce the deficit to $136 billion.

   By shuffling the summit schedule and
questioning delegations set to meet with President Reagan, Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is sending an unmistakeable signal that
he intends to seize the initiative during the pair's Moscow
face-off.
   The challenge facing Reagan as he awaits the start of the summit
Sunday is to maintain his well-rehearsed game plan _ or to alter it
to compete with the Soviet leader.
   The Soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talks
opening Monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of the
people who hoped to meet with Reagan.

   President Reagan, in his first visit to the Soviet
capital, will see an enormous city of 12-lane boulevards dominated
in part by seven massive Stalin-era Baroque buildings. He will see
the city at its best: the lilacs are blooming, the weather is mild
and downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes.
   Arriving for the first time in the Soviet capital is at times
like taking a trip back in time. The electrical appliances seem
old-fashioned and traffic jams are rare, though smog has taken hold.
   Nearly 9 million people live here, yet the only time it seems
crowded is when people are queuing to buy food, perfume, and other
scarce consumer goods. Humans are dwarfed by immense buildings,
both the charmless, modern structures from the 1960s _ said to be
modeled on buildings Nikita Khrushchev saw and liked in New York
City _ and a variety of monuments to mother Russia's war heroes.

Moscow summit next week.
   It was the first major U.S.-Soviet arms control accord ratified
by the Senate since 1972.
   Leading up to the ratification vote, the Senate rejected four
minor amendments offered by Republicans. That brought to 14 the

   The nearly $300 billion bill was approved on a voice vote in a
mostly empty Senate chamber after Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
dropped his amendment that would have permitted the death penalty

   That amendment had stalled the measure for two weeks because
supporters of the bill said the proposal would never be accepted by

   Latin America appears to be in
a quandary over Panama and its military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The South and Central American nations that have espoused
civilian democratic governments after decades of military rule have
expressed little regard for Noriega.
   But, because of their own historical experience, they also look
unkindly on overt attempts by Washington to dictate who should run
a country and how he should do it.
   The little regional reaction to the breakdown in U.S.-Panamanian
talks aimed at Noriega's removal has been cautious and wavering.
The talks involved an offer from the United States to drop
drug-trafficking charges against Noriega in exchange for his
removal as Panama's leader.

<DATELINE>ALBION, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the ``Albion Tornado'' roared toward
East State Street three years ago, Earl Rice ran to warn his wife,
Ruth, on their front porch ``when I saw the wind pick her up and
throw her over the rail.''
   Across the street, the Rev. Robert J. Reilly prayed hard as the
gathering winds sucked him toward a second-floor window and his
strength ebbed.
   Next door, 5-year-old Katie Steff screamed ``Tornado coming!''
as her father, Samuel, huddled the family above their funeral home.
In a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later, Steff knew they
were in the eye of the huge twister.
   Forty-one tornadoes, including nine of the highest intensities,
swept through Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Ontario during eight
hours of May 31, 1985, killing 88 people and injuring more than
1,000.
   The tornado outbreak, worst since April 1975, caused $450
million in property damage in the United States.
   Of the dead, 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and
a disproportionate number, 15, were between 66 and 70 years old,
according to the National Weather Service.
   The Albion tornado was among the worst, packing winds estimated
at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the
Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The twister, estimated at 1,200 feet
across, quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads
town near Lake Erie on a 14-mile tear that killed 12 people.
   ``I watch the sky now, just like everyone else,'' Mayor Bonda
Dahlin said recently. ``Tornadoes were Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska
kind of things. But I don't think it's something we'll ever
forget.''
   ``People here still cringe the minute there's a dark cloud in
the sky. There's such anticipation,'' said Borough Secretary Paul
McKnight.
   Rice, 72, a retired railroad worker, heard the first frantic
warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife
get swept away. He woke up trapped in his own house.
   ``I started hollering,'' Rice recalled. ``There were timbers all
over me. The beams were across my legs and I couldn't move. They
tried to jack up the beams, but that just put more pressure on my
legs. Then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and
pulled me out.''
   Rice suffered only cuts and bruises. His wife suffered broken
arms and a dislocated shoulder.
   Reilly, 68, pastor of St. Lawrence Roman Catholic Church, was in
his rectory's living room ``when the roof went off and the windows
went out.''
   ``I kind of spread-eagled in front of the window as the thing
began to suck me out. I grabbed anything. I just hung on until it
ended,'' Reilly said. ``I asked God to make it that I was ready to
meet Him.''
   The church and rectory were destroyed, but two days later Reilly
said Mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins.
   Steff, 43, a mortician, gathered his wife, four daughters and a
friend in the family room of their second-floor apartment. Katie
screamed just as Albion's fire siren began to wail.
   ``Then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom.
Things just bombarded the building,'' Steff recalled. ``Then we
heard a silence, just for a second, like in the eye of a hurricane.
Then everything hit us from the other side. Patty, my wife, opened
the door of the family room and it was gone.''
   The Steffs' business and home were destroyed, a $200,000 loss.
   Steff ran across the street to help free Cathy Gibson from her
three-story Victorian house, which was down.
   ``I called into the debris to tell her help was coming,'' Steff
said. ``Later, she told me she was never so glad to hear an
undertaker's voice.''
   A deputy Erie County coroner, Steff helped set up a morgue at
Northwestern High School. They brought in 11 bodies.
   Today, the tornado's southwest-to-northeast path can be clearly
seen in rebuilt split-level houses and new mobile homes, grassy
lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of Albion
look like a new subdivision.
   It was only a few months ago, McKnight said, that he ``closed
the books'' on Albion's claims with federal and state disaster
officials.
   Mayor Dahlin estimated that fewer than 200 of the town's 1,800
people moved away after the tornado ``because of memories, lack of
money or whatever.''
   ``People are getting on with their lives,'' she said.
``Businesses are being rebuilt, changing hands, and there are new
ones.''
   Reilly's modern new 400-seat church is linked by a glass
breezeway to a new three-bedroom rectory. Behind, a new recreation
building stands in red brick. The complex cost $1.1 million, he
said.
   ``One of the greatest experiences of my life, as tragic as it
was, was to see the spirit of the people of this town. They took a
tragic blow. They rebuilt the town,'' Reilly said.
   ``It's almost profane to say it was a good thing, but the bottom
line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town
is even physically better with all the new construction,'' he said.
   The Steffs, fully insured, rebuilt their small funeral home with
two viewing rooms, but took the opportunity to move their living
quarters to a house in another part of town.
   ``We shed our tears over it. We're trying to get our lives
together. You can dwell on the negatives, but the positives are the
concern and the love of the community,'' Steff said.
   ``When I walked out the door that day, I knew I was going to
stay.''
   The Rices built a modern two-bedroom split-level house. ``It's
starting to feel like home,'' Rice said with a shrug.
   ``You still think about it. Last September, I had an operation
for cancer and when I was in the recovery room, I thought I was
still under the house,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to see another one.''

<TEXT>
   Long after colonialism yielded to
independence for many African nations, their art is still in the
grip of Europe.
   Masks, sculptures, ritual objects, jewelry _ once mere utensils
for African tribes _ have become coveted art pieces in Europe. And
a show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts here shows interest is still
gaining.
   African art is so abundant in such former colonial powers as
Belgium, that the show relied on 50 private collections for
material. Organizers say there was no need to tap other sources,
such as museums, religious orders and companies with a colonial
past to stage the exhibit that has been widely acclaimed.
   ``In colonial times, the pieces were brought here and stacked
away and little happened afterwards,'' said Elze Bruyninx, an
organizer of the Brussels show. ``Now there is increasing interest
for their aesthetic qualities.''
   As the exhibit demonstrates, private collectors have had a sharp
eye for quality. ``What we found in private collections was world
class quality,'' said Frank Herreman of Antwerp's ethnographical
museum, who helped stage the exhibit.
   The show displays 330 pieces, many from central Africa,
featuring the severe expressionist lines that mark African art. It
includes terracotta pieces, over 2,000 years old, from Nigeria and
centuries-old wooden and metal statues and masks from Mali and
Mozambique. Many are from the former Belgian colony Zaire, others
are from as far away as Angola.
   They are on view until mid-June and already over 20,000 people
have visited the show since it opened in late March.
   The richness of European collections has long been a source of
misgiving in African nations.
   Some, spurred by President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, have in
recent decades joined such nations as Greece, which has staged
diplomatic protests to focus on the loss of some of its finest art
to invading European powers.
   Imbata Mosumbe, cultural director of the Zairian Embassy in
Brussels, laments that legislation has never been enacted to ensure
the return of art works.
   ``We wish it would return. We only have moral arguments though,
and to rely on morals is a pious wish,'' he said.
   ``Mobutu told the United Nations that the colonial powers had
taken everything and that they now had to give it back,'' said
Huguette Van Geluwe, head of the ethnography department of the
Museum of Central Africa near Brussels. One of the world's biggest
treasure troves of African art, it boasts an extensive collection
of Zairian art.
   Since the waning days of colonialism in the 1960s, some art
works have returned home from former colonial powers, but it has
been more a trickle than the flow that African nations wanted.
   ``African leaders and the intellectuals are now very conscious
of its value and appreciate the pieces as art,'' said Bruyninx.
   However, this was not always so. What is now called African art
often had its origins as simple utensils. African masks and
sculptures had medical or protective functions. The notion of ``art
for art's sake'' was a novel concept of Africa's colonizers.
   ``From the moment an object lost its function it became
worthless,'' Bruyninx said. Often, they rotted in the tropical
conditions or were even ritually destroyed.
   ``As a pure art object, it was seldom of value,'' she said.
   Europe soon changed that. After the utensils and other objects
came to Europe as exotic curiosities, some European artists,
including Pablo Picasso, created an active interest by blending it
into their own works.
   Bruyninx said the objects were well cared for in Europe where
African art became a phenomenon in its own right.
   ``Many Africans are pleased when they see what has happened with
their art here,'' Van Geluwe said. ``They see it as a showcase for
their country.''
   The Utotombo exhibit in Brussels, for example, has been endorsed
by Zaire's ambassador here, despite Zaire's hope of recovering its
art from Belgium.
   ``Contradictions are the spice of life,'' Mosumbe said.
   Although much African art is now in Europe and the United
States, many works is still in Africa, according to Herreman.
   ``What makes it tough for many African nations is that their
museums are not suitably'' managed to handle it, he said.
   For one thing, there is the lure of money. With some pieces
fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions in the West,
some art works simply disappear from African museums, experts say.
   And even when an African museum has a first-right option on
national art works, it often cannot afford them.

<HEAD>Economists Don't Like It, But Equilibrium Is More Exception Than
Rule</HEAD>

   Economists are uncovering peculiar similarities
in events that range from the death of the steam-powered automobile
in the early 1900s to the crash of the stock market last October.
   The decline of Sony's Betamax, they find, has something in
common with the birth of the auto industry in Detroit.
   There are even similarities between the width of railroad tracks
and the strange QWERTY arrangement of keys on a typewriter.
   In different ways, these rises and falls all defy economic
doctrines of stability.
   All are examples of ``positive feedback'' _ things that get
going in one direction and then keep going the same way. Like an
avalanche, or a whistling microphone, or a buffalo stampede.
   Positive feedback helps explain what happened last Oct. 19, when
corporate America lost nearly a quarter of its paper value in a
single day.
   When prices dropped that day, buyers should have come in to pick
up bargains. But trading strategies such as portfolio insurance
locked the market into a suicidal loop of positive feedback, so
each price decline triggered fresh sales.
   Portfolio insurers said they could protect investors against
losses by selling their stocks and putting the money into
interest-bearing Treasury bills. It worked _ until everybody else
tried to sell at the same time.
   The loop was finally broken on Oct. 20, when the U.S. financial
system was nearing gridlock.
   If all stocks had been covered by portfolio insurance, the Dow
Jones industrial average theoretically could have sunk to zero.
That is the power of positive feedback.
   In less frightening ways, positive feedback explains other
things that defy traditional concepts of equilibrium.
   Once the VHS format got a slight edge over Sony's Betamax, for
example, video rental shops began stocking more VHS tapes. That
encouraged more people to buy VHS recorders, and so on. Now even
Sony Corp. has added a VHS recorder line.
   Snowball effects likewise account for how railroad tracks that
are 4 feet, 8{ inches wide crowded out other gauges, or why autos
and electronics came to be concentrated in Detroit and Silicon
Valley instead of evenly spread across the country.
   Herds of buffalo eventually get tired of stampeding. And at some
point salaries for electronics engineers may get so high in Silicon
Valley that it makes sense to locate elsewhere.
   Tired buffalo and overcrowding in Silicon Valley are examples of
negative feedback, which leads to the cherished equilibrium of
standard economics.
   In some cases, though, negative feedback never kicks in. Society
becomes ``locked in,'' to use the phrase of W. Brian Arthur, a
professor of population studies and economics at Stanford
University who has done pioneering research in the field.
   Paul David, a colleague of Arthur at Stanford, has traced how
the QWERTY typewriter layout has persisted in spite of the obvious
superiority of the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, which is 20 to 40
percent faster and can be learned in a few days.
   Then there is the clean, efficient steam-powered automobile,
which exists no more. Years ago, smelly gasoline-powered cars
gained some tiny advantage that grew into total dominance because
the country was not big enough for two kinds of cars.
   In 1904, a man named William Fletcher with a cloudy crystal ball
wrote: ``Unless the objectionable features of the petrol carriage
can be removed, it is bound to be driven from the road, to give
place to its less objectionable rival, the steam-driven vehicle of
the day.''
   Fletcher knew the power of positive feedback. He just bet on the
wrong horseless carriage.
   In 1988, it's clear that many people don't know the power of
positive feedback. For example, whiz kids in finance failed to
foresee the damage that portfolio insurance could wreak in a
falling stock market.
   Knowing about the snowball effect doesn't guarantee being able
to do anything about it, but who knows? One thing could lead to
another.

<HEAD>Arabs and Jews Live in Harmony in Judean Village</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEVE SHALOM, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The name for this village in Hebrew
and Arabic means ``Oasis of Peace,'' and it is taken seriously by
the Arabs and Jews who have been living here together for the past
10 years in the Judean foothills.
   The recent Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip has created strains for them but it has also
brought new levels of cooperation and understanding to the
community's 14 families _ nine Jewish, five Israeli Arab.
   ``It's paradoxical,'' said Abed Najah, an Arab who is the
village secretary. ``The uprising has made us stronger. We are more
certain than ever that what we are doing is the best and most
important thing to do.''
   Those who came to live in the village that once was a no man's
land 15 miles west of Jerusalem chose to span the national and
religious divide that splits Israeli Jews and Arabs into hostile
and suspicious groups.
   Here they share authority, educate their children in Hebrew and
Arabic, and try to spread a message of tolerance to visiting
Israeli high school children through special seminars in their
``School of Peace.''
   Living together for a decade has never been simple, however.
   Arab residents had to fight for official recognition for the
Arabic name for the village, Wahati Al-Salaam. Also, under a
compromise agreement, Jews observe the Israeli Independence Day
holiday while Arabs do not.
   But the 70 residents are determined to find an alternative to
the current realities of Arab-Jewish relations.
   Outside Neve Shalom, tensions between Arabs and Jews have been
seriously exacerbated over the past five months by the Palestinian
uprising.
   Neve Shalom has been largely protected from the tensions,
according to Ariella Beeri, 29, an Israeli spokeswoman for the
School of Peace and a longtime resident of the village.
   ``The uprising was not new for anyone who already developed
social and political awareness,'' she said. ``We have always been
aware of the reality of the occupation.''
   Jews and Arabs in Neve Shalom regard the Arab revolt as a sign
that the Palestinians have taken responsibility for their own fate.
   ``I am very proud of the uprising,'' said Najah, the village
secretary. ``Today the Palestinians are writing the brightest page
of their history.''
   Until now, Neve Shalom, or Wahati Al-Salaam, avoided politics so
as not to drive away Jewish high school children from the School of
Peace seminars.
   But the Palestinian uprising has changed that. Recently all 70
Neve Shalom residents demonstrated in Jerusalem against what they
view as excessively harsh measures used by the Isreali army to
supress Palestinian demonstrators.
   Neve Shalom also has set up exchange visits with the nearby West
Bank village of Bet Sira and has sent its residents food supplies.
   ``We visited just after the soldiers were there,'' said Najah.
``We saw the fear in their eyes, and how the women and children
stank of tear gas.''
   ``We always thought of Neve Shalom as an educational project,''
he added. ``But we've seen lately that things are happening that
force us to take action.''
   The residents of Neve Shalom are reluctant to discuss tensions
caused in their community by the Palestinian uprising. But one
especially sensitive point is military reserve duty, required of
Jewish residents of Neve Shalom but not the Arabs.
   So far, none of the four residents called up have been sent to
the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   ``The village doesn't tell them what to do,'' said Ms. Beeri.
``But there's a lot of social pressure for them not to serve in the
occupied territories. If they go, it will be hard for them to face
the others.''
   Ms. Beeri says the uprising has altered relations between the
Jewish and Arabs students who come for the peace seminars, however.
   ``The uprising is strengthening the Arabs. It is giving them the
feeling that someone is looking out for their interests. The Jews
are frightened by the power of the uprising, by how close it is to
them geographically.''
   The seminar talks also have taken on a new urgency. The Jewish
high school students see the issues as personal and crucial.
   They are only a year away from being drafted into the army and
that is likely to lead to direct and violent confrontation with
Palestinians.
   Beeri said one Jewish student put it succinctly when he said
goodbye to Arab students at the end of a seminar.
   ``See you again at the stone-throwing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Time Comes for Mules and Men to Guard India's Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHILLONG, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the snow melts in the Himalayas,
winter's natural barrier comes down and it becomes the task of men,
mules and machines of the Indian army to take up a long summer
vigil on the disputed frontier with China.
   Last summer the world's two most populous nations massed 300,000
troops along the border after trading charges of border violations.
   ``This summer we are leaving nothing to chance after last year's
experience,'' said an army officer in the garrison town of Shillong
in northeastern India.
   Starting in May, the ``dormant'' status of the 105,000 Indian
soldiers stationed on the frontier in Arunachal Pradesh state was
upgraded to ``live,'' the officer said. This means the troops can
be called for combat on short notice.
   ``It does not mean we are preparing for a war or itching for it,
but this is the price we have to pay to keep the Chinese dragon
away,'' said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   India and China fought a border war in 1962 and their relations
have remained strained. China claims 34,750 square miles of Indian
land that covers the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh.
   India not only rejects the Chinese claim to the state but says
Beijing captured 14,000 square miles of northwestern Kashmir state
during the 1962 war.
   China has offered to give up its claim to Arunachal Pradesh if
India recognizes Beijing's sovereignty over areas of Kashmir. But
in eight rounds of talks that began in December 1981, India has
refused the Chinese offer, claiming both areas belong to India.
   An Indian reporter for The Associated Press recently toured the
northeastern states, which are off-limits to foreigners, to see the
Indian army's preparedness.
   Long military convoys moved regularly from the central command
base of Tezpur in Assam state to border areas in neighboring
Arunachal Pradesh. Trucks towed tarpaulin-covered field guns.
Hundreds of mules hauled rations and artillery through terrain so
rugged that India has not been able to build roads.
   In the last two months India has sent two divisions, 30,000
soldiers in all, to Arunachal Pradesh to reinforce 75,000 troops
already stationed on the frontier.
   An additional 60,000 soldiers are garrisoned within about 300
miles of the frontier.
   The Indian air force has up to 160 interceptors, 55 to 60
deep-penetration aircraft and 35 to 40 bombers in the region.
   ``Our military presence in the eastern sector is enough to
counter any Chinese military adventures,'' a senior Defense
Ministry official in New Delhi said.
   A Chinese diplomat in New Delhi said the Indians were
exaggerating the so-called Chinese threat.
   ``We have neither the intention nor the need to push Indian
troops back. We are happy where we are,'' the diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But Brig. R.S. Virk, who retired from the Indian army last year,
said in an interview in Assam: ``The whole exercise is more of a
shadow boxing than real military necessity.
   ``There is nothing to gain in the Godforsaken land. Not even a
blade of grass grows there.''
   The border dispute between China and India stems from a line
drawn on a map in 1914 by Sir Henry McMahon, foreign secretary of
British colonial India.
   India accepts the line _ or its interpretation of it. China does
not.
   The McMahon line was drawn with a thick red pencil. On the map,
the line covers, in breadth, four to five miles in actual territory.
   Border tension in the area started in May 1986 with reports that
China had moved in troops and built a helipad in the Sumdrong Chu
Valley. The valley lies one to two miles south of the McMahon line,
according to India, and north of it, according to China.
   In April 1987, Indian troops advanced close to Chinese soldiers.
The Indians said they spotted intruding Chinese patrols in four
areas claimed by India. China rejected the Indian report and
accused India of setting up seven lookout posts north of the line.
   China has a population of 1.02 billion and 2.9 million men under
arms. India with 800 million people has 1.2 million military
personnel. But India has air superiority in its Soviet and French
aircraft.
   The summer vigil, however, costs India an additional $100,000 a
day in high-altitude pay for soldiers, extra rations and air
surveillance.
   That puts more economic strain on a nation that has 37 percent
of its people living below the poverty line.

<HEAD>The `Misfortune 500' Peeks Under the Executive Carpet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Peel back the carpet in the executive suite, and
you'll need a shovel to dig through what's been swept underneath.
   At least that's the tone of the rollicking ``Misfortune 500,'' a
210-page catalog of Corporate America's ``worst bosses, dumbest
strategies and most disastrous products.''
   Authors Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo's guiding premise is that
business blunders don't get the attention they deserve thanks to
``uptight execs'' who are basically humorless _ except when it
comes to the faux pas of their competitors.
   ``We have a great respect for big business because it is the
backbone of America, but they have to learn to lighten up a little
bit,'' Nash said.
   From the Adams Natural Beverage Co. to Zale Corp., these two
irreverent business bashers dug for the dirt and found it.
   Among the biggest blunders, they roast the Mars candy company
for passing up the chance to have M&Ms featured in the 1982
box-office blockbuster ``E.T.'' The movie's lovable alien devoured
Reese's Pieces instead, boosting sales for rival chocolate maker
Hershey Food Corp.
   And speaking of chocolate, from the
products-that-didn't-get-off-the-ground (thank God) department is
chocolate styling gel for hair. The category also includes parsnip
chips.
   Nash and Zullo, both 40 and both residents of Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., say they met at a party five years ago and soon
began building a ``cottage industry of shame.''
   Since then, they have published five different sports-oriented
``Hall of Shame'' books, starting with ``The Baseball Hall of
Shame.''
   The business book took ``a solid three months of research and
another few months to write,'' Nash said. Its official publication
date is June 1, and the price is $7.95.
   In their book, Nash and Zullo question Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca's sincerity in urging everybody to ``buy American''
when he appears in ads clutching a cigar rolled in the Dominican
Republic.
   And they ask why Coleco Industries Inc. reneged on a promise to
mail first birthday cards to the 3.2 million Cabbage Patch Kids
registered with the toy maker.
   The duo even counted up the many ways corporations say
``Layoffs.'' ITT Corp. once called them ``headcount reductions'';
the accounting firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. used the phrase
``requested departures''; and Control Data Corp. called them
``workforce adjustments.''
   Disasters that are particularly prickly for companies are those
that involve the press. At one news conference that went awry, the
president of Rival pet food chowed down a new all-beef dinner after
a persnickety collie turned its nose up at the grub.
   For eager shareholders ready to head for the annual meeting,
Nash and Zullo suggest they buy a plane ticket and take along a map
if they want to meet up with some elusive boards of directors.
Schlumberger Ltd. held its meeting on the island of Curacao in 1984
_ lots of shareholders there. And General Host Corp. held its 1967
meeting in the middle of the Florida Everglades, perhaps to
accommodate any stock-owning mosquitoes.
   Some companies learned the hard way that it doesn't always pay
to go out of their way. United Airlines once sent thank-you letters
to wives of executives who had participated in the airline's ``Fly
Your Wife Free'' campaign.
   But the airline was inundated with angry letters from outraged
wives who had never flown their friendly skies. The spouses even
demanded the names of their executive husbands' flying companions.
   Nash and Zullo say the most important lesson businesses need to
learn is not to fear mistakes. As for their next project, ``We
don't yet know where we'll look to uncover more shame,'' Nash said.

<HEAD>Esteemed Swedish Actor Turns To London Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish screen star Max Von Sydow, whose new film
``Pelle the Conqueror'' won the grand prize at the Cannes Film
Festival, is turning to the English stage in a career move he
described as ``a great surprise.''
   ``It's very exciting,'' the tall, lanky Von Sydow said of his
upcoming role as Prospero in Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' The
play opens Oct. 6 at London's Old Vic theater for a limited run
through Nov. 26.
   The production, directed by Jonathan Miller, will mark Von
Sydow's first English-language appearance on the London stage. He
previously appeared in Britain in 1974 in a Swedish staging of
Henrik Ibsen's ``The Wild Duck.''
   That production was directed by Ingmar Bergman, with whom Von
Sydow has had a long and illustrious career on stage and in such
films as ``The Seventh Seal,'' ``Wild Strawberries,'' ``Through a
Glass Darkly'' and ``The Passion of Anna.''
   On Broadway, Von Sydow has starred in two flops: ``The Night of
the Tribades,'' with Eileen Atkins and Bibi Andersson, and ``Duet
for One,'' with Anne Bancroft.
   ``It's a very interesting idea,'' Von Sydow, 58, said of
director Miller's choice that he play Prospero, a part more often
associated with English actors in their twilight years.
   Miller, in a separate interview, explained his casting.
   ``I wanted to break out of the noble aria approach English
performers often take to the part,'' said Miller, who is in his
first year as the artistic director of London's venerable Old Vic.
   ``I've never seen Max on stage, but I know he is a great,
accomplished actor. I've seen all his films.''
   Prospero furthers what has been an unusually busy year for Von
Sydow. He is presently appearing at the National Theater of
Stockholm in August Strindberg's 1872 ``Master Olof.''
   In Bille August's prize-winning Danish film, ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' Von Sydow heads up a family of immigrant farmworkers
at the turn of the century, giving a performance for which he's won
critical praise. The film won La Palme D'Or, the top prize, at the
41st annual Cannes Film Festival which ended on May 23.
   Von Sydow was also represented at Cannes with his directorial
debut, ``Katinka,'' adapted from a novel by the Danish author
Herman Bang about a three-way love affair.
   He said he had originally hoped to act in a movie version of the
book when he first read the novel 25 years ago.
   Now, since he was too old for the male leads, he decided to
direct the movie instead: ``Coincidence put the possibility in my
hands.''
   Of his English-language films, Von Sydow said he looked back
fondly on ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' Woody Allen's 1986 movie in
which he played Barbara Hershey's tortured, irascible companion.
   ``Most of the scripts one gets are so bad it was wonderful to
receive one with intelligent dialogue,'' said the actor, who felt
challenged by Allen's requirements.
   ``He (Allen) demands 200 percent of a naturalistic style. He
does not allow any literary phrasings or pronunciation,'' Von Sydow
said.
   This version of ``The Tempest'' will mark the fourth major
production of the play to be seen in England this year; both the
star and his director said they would not be seeing the others.
   ``It's very disturbing to be influenced,'' said Von Sydow, who
last played Shakespeare's conjurer-poet in a Swedish production 35
years ago when, he said, he was ``much too young.''
   Miller said, ``I don't go very much to the theater. It's too
much of a busman's holiday.''

<HEAD>Documentary Reveals War Not Over for Many Vietnam Vets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It would seem, in view of the much-visited
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington and the popularity of
Vietnam movies in the theaters and on TV, that America has finally
welcomed the Vietnam veteran home.
   But as reported in the powerful CBS documentary ``The Wall
Within'' this Thursday, as many as 1 million Vietnam veterans have
yet to leave behind a war that still terrorizes them every day, and
little has been done to help them. Some have committed suicide and
abused their families. Others suffer flashbacks, nightmares and
withdrawal.
   CBS went to Washington state, where many veterans who suffer
from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder have fled. The dense forests,
perhaps reminiscent of the jungles of Vietnam, shelter them from a
world where they cannot speak of the atrocities they witnessed.
   ``They literally took to the hills,'' CBS anchor Dan Rather said
in an interview. Rather interviewed some of the veterans and
narrates the documentary, which was produced and directed by Paul
and Holly Fine and written by Perry Wolff.
   ``I don't want to have to be nobody all my life,'' says Terry
Bradley, one of the veterans interviewed for the documentary. ``I'd
want to be able to come home, with some dignity.''
   Bradley's reward for his service in Vietnam was overmedication
as a paranoid schizophrenic that left him with organic brain
damage. Other veterans tell of facing rejection and indifference
when they returned from combat.
   ``This hour that we do, this is not the movie `Platoon.' This is
real stuff,'' said Rather. ``These are real people struggling to
recover from real wounds.''
   Another of the veterans interviewed describes how he almost
killed his mother when she woke him one morning and he thought she
was the enemy.
   Some of the veterans are beginning to deal with PTSD in the only
way they can, by talking to other veterans in rap groups sponsored
by Vietnam veterans centers, many of which will soon be closed due
to lack of funding.
   One reason some of the veterans talked to CBS was because Rather
had been in Vietnam as a reporter.
   ``They won't even consider talking to somebody who didn't go to
Vietnam,'' he said. ``It was slow going to even get them to talk to
us. So my reporting from Vietnam was a help.'' Rather said he also
had to listen to a lot of complaints about how the war was reported.
   One veteran took Rather on a flashlight visit to the small,
unlit room he keeps at the back of his basement where the walls are
covered with rough drawings, like a cave-dweller's, depicting his
Vietnam nightmares.
   ``As very young people they were plunged into a green jungle
hell,'' said Rather. ``They saw terrible and horrific things. They
saw these things done to others, done to themselves. Then suddenly
they are jerked back and dumped back into a country where in many
cases they were despised, humiliated, criticized, and still very
young. Is it any wonder that they suffered a psychological wound
that is deep and abiding?''
   Another veteran suffers from a symptom of PTSD called
``hypervigilance.'' He recalls with great difficulty watching a
buddy die on the deck of an aircraft carrier because he was not
alert enough. So he patrols incessantly at night, driving city
streets or back roads in his truck.
   Mike Rice suffers from flashbacks. Viewers, like Rather, will be
moved to reach out physically to Rice as he breaks down while he
struggles to describe the aftermath of an enemy attack.
   ``I noticed the sergeant kinda laying over some of the pipes
over there. I knew he was hurt, and he'd always kinda come around
and showed us a picture of his family _ his wife, his little boy
and little girl. He was just laying over there, and I thought, God,
no one's helpin' this guy, and I ran over there to help him and
reached down and grabbed him and he was, um, he was, um, he was
blown in half. He was b-b-blown in half. It was just his top half.
It was just his top half left. ...'' He breaks down into sobs.
   ``He's healing,'' assures Rather. ``He's healing because until
now he couldn't tell this story to anyone. He had his flashbacks
alone.''
   CBS seems to have helped the healing somewhat by bringing three
of the veterans, Bradley, Rice and John Michaelson, to the Vietnam

   Talking about money is something that just wasn't
done in Britain until only a few years ago.
   Now, because of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's capitalist
revolution, business, economics and personal finance are
increasingly popular subjects on British television.
   The number of television hours devoted to money matters has
grown to more than 200 a year from about 30 hours annually just
four years ago.
   ``Business is suddenly a much more interesting topic,'' said
Caroline Thomson, independent Channel 4's commissioning editor for
business, industry and science.
   The new shows have included a daily news show, a game show and
even a dramatic series.
   Britain's two publicly funded British Broadcasting Corp.
channels and two independent channels are all thinking money, but
the biggest push has been made by Channel 4.
   In September it introduced ``Business Daily,'' a half-hour news
program airing at midday Monday through Friday and targeted at
professionals in the City, London's financial district.
   In addition, Channel 4 introduced in January a Sunday night game
show, ``The Stocks and Shares Show,'' in which contestants compete
to make the most profit by investing play money in stocks.
   Channel 4 also recently ran a live weekly series called ``The
Business Exchange,'' which gave advice to some of Britain's budding
entrepreneurs on how to get financing and other topics.
   Also unusual was a six-part weekly dramatic series set in the
City, rather than more typically in London's swanky neighborhoods,
the cockney East End or the government's labyrinthian buildings.
   Called ``Killing on the Exchange,'' it ran on Independent
Television's main channel in prime time last year.
   ``There has been a big change in attitude in the past five years
toward business with privatization and the Big Bang explosion in
the City,'' Ms. Thomson said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has privatized, or sold off, billions of pounds'
worth of nationalized industries since she came into power in 1979,
partly to get more shares into the hands of the British public.
   The number of individual shareholders in Britain has trebled to
7 million in the nine years.
   Big Bang, most of which took place in October 1986, was a huge
deregulation and computerization of Britain's financial services
industry.
   ``Now, in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain, people can talk about profit
without it being a dirty word,'' Ms. Thomson said.
   Not all television viewers have been capitivated by these money
matters programs. Ms. Thomson conceded that talking about personal
finances is still taboo for many Britons.
   ``The respectable thing in Britain is not to talk about
finances, even how much they paid for a house. There are all sorts
of traditions about not revealing how much you earn.'' she said.
``That's part of the British being rather buttoned-up people.''
   The husband of a woman interviewed for ``Moneyspinner,'' a
Channel 4 personal finances program, had a fit when he found out
about it and insisted that the interview be deleted, Ms. Thomson
said.
   Still, ``Moneyspinner,'' which appears Tuesday nights in series
of eight programs, is the most popular of the money shows on
Channel 4, attracting about 2 million viewers.
   ``The Stocks and Shares Show'' has its detractors, too.
   ``It's caused more controversy than anything else I've done,''
Ms. Thomson said. Critics feel the channel shouldn't encourage
speculation, she said.
   The innovative programming comes on top of an increase in the
number of more traditional types of money matters shows, such as
the weekly current affairs programs and the odd documentary on, for
example, insider trading.
   The oldest and most popular money program on British television
is BBC 2's 22-year-old ``The Money Programme,'' a current-affairs
show viewed by almost 3 million people on Sunday evenings.
   The show features hosts conducting studio interviews with
business-world celebrities and expanded segments on newsworthy
topics.
   The trend is evident in the theater, too. Currently running are
the British plays ``Serious Money,'' which is also playing in New
York, and ``Speculators.''

<TEXT>
   Austrian best-selling writer
Johannes Mario Simmel churns out the kind of pop novels West
Germans love to read in secret.
   His crime and romance tales have captivated the general public
but horrified many highbrow critics and intellectuals. In the last
40 years they have called Simmel everything from a ``cliche
factory'' to an ``opium for the masses.''
   The popular author remains unruffled, however. His books have
made him one of the world's best-selling German-language writers.
More than 65 million copies of his novels have been sold around the
world, appearing in 25 languages, including English.
   His latest work, a thriller about gene technologists bent on
world destruction, has been high on national best-seller lists
since it hit the market last August.
   The book is also selling well in France, Italy, Spain, the
Netherlands, Yugoslavia and the Scandinavian countries, where
Simmel has been popular for years.
   ``The only country where they have this terrible
schoolteacher-type criticism of my work is West Germany,'' the
64-year-old Austrian said in an interview.
   Notice from other countries include a Johannes Mario Simmel
collection of the author's more than 20 works at the Boston
University library.
   Simmel's current best seller is ``But With Clowns Came the
Tears,'' which focuses on the AIDS epidemic and the dangers of gene
technology. It was released by the Munich-based Droemer-Knaur
Verlag publishing house and has not yet been scheduled for the
United States.
   In the book the superpowers are locked in a battle over genetic
and viral manipulation techniques that could determine the fate of
the world.
   ``Contemporary issues have always been the driving force of my
work,'' Simmel said. ``My novels are not really novels; they are a
combination of fact and fiction.
   ``It would be a crime to just write fiction when there are so
many horrible things happening in the world, important issues
people should be made aware of.''
   In novels and screenplays Simmel has treated such themes as
alcoholism (he is a recovered alcoholic), education of the
psychologically disturbed and fascism and the Nazi period.
   ``I will write against Nazis and neo-Nazis as long as I live. To
me they are the greatest criminals in history,'' Simmel said,
adding that the Nazi period was one of the worst of his life.
During most of the war he was a chemist in Vienna.
   One work dealing with the Nazi era, ``The Monte Cristo
Cover-Up,'' made Simmel famous in the early 1960s. The often
humorous account of a wartime cook and spy included numerous
gourmet recipes.
   Simmel partly attributes his focus on current events to his
roots as a journalist. He spent years as a reporter for the
Austrian daily newspaper Welt am Abend and the West German weekly
newsmagazine Quick.
   The writer said journalism has also influenced his painstaking
research methods. Simmel spends up to a year gathering facts for a
book.
   ``I traveled to several countries researching gene technology,
for example, talking to experts,'' he said.
   But contemporary relevance and authenticity alone are not what
makes his books sell, he readily admits.
   ``My trick is to report about these grave issues and package
them in an entertaining story,'' Simmel said.
   His new book opens with a circus performance where clowns
suddenly shoot into the audience. The clowns were hired to kill a
noted geneticist who was at the show but they also hit the child of
a news reporter. She immediately gets on the case.
   As in every ``Simmel,'' as his books are called, there is a love
story, this time between the reporter and a scientist pulled into
the chain of events.
   And it is precisely the entertainment side of his work that has
given Simmel trouble with critics and the more literary minded.
   ``Many people here don't like to admit they enjoy Simmel,''
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung critic Frank Schirrmacher said in an
interview. ``It's not seen as `intellectual' enough.''
   Schirrmacher said the embarrassment is due to a serious-minded
German literary tradition.
   ``There's no tradition in Germany of entertaining literature
that's also considered high quality,'' Schirrmacher said.
``Literature here has to be complicated, not easily understood, in
order to be respected.''
   The gray-haired, bespectacled Simmel lives in Zug, Switzerland,
which he said he now regards as his home. His wife died of cancer
in 1985.

<HEAD>`ET' Host Gives Showgirl Role A Try</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Mary Hart was growing up in Sioux
Falls, S.D., her mother often worried about the future
``Entertainment Tonight'' host running away to become a showgirl.
   Well, Mom, don't look now, but ...
   The perky blonde, who taught high school English and piano while
doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career,
recently made her stage debut in Las Vegas.
   With more bookings here and in Atlantic City, plus summer stock
and music festivals this summer, Hart's ready to continue her dual
professional role, although she'd just as soon skip those 18-hour
days, juggling two careers in two cities.
   Her grueling daily grind _ shuttling between this city's Glitter
Gulch for her long-awaited fling at singing and dancing, then back
to a Hollywood ``ET'' set for more TV patter _ gave new meaning to
the concept of commuting to work.
   Hart realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks
appearing with comedian David Brenner at the Golden Nugget Hotel
and Casino earlier this month.
   But she admits she wouldn't care for a steady diet of the double
duty.
   ``I performed at 8 and again at 11,'' she said. ``Then I caught
a 1 a.m. flight to Los Angeles, and hit the house about 2:45. I got
up at 7:30 and was at Paramount (where `ET' is filmed) by 8 a.m. We
did our promos and other spots, then began taping the show at 11:30
a.m. At 2:45 in the afternoon I was on a flight back to Vegas.
   ``Both worlds is not an ideal situation,'' she laughed as she
relaxed between shows during her two-week engagement. ``It's
conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period
of time.''
   In her show, Hart does several dance numbers and displays a
surprisingly good singing voice. Her appearance and style are
reminiscent of Ann-Margret when she was a Las Vegas headliner for
years.
   Hart's sexy legs _ insured by Lloyd's of London for $2 million _
are amply displayed in the Las Vegas show. The legs are a product
of a lot of hard work, including a treadmill, rowing machine and
Exercycle at home, 25 miles of speed-walking a week, and aerobics
and dance classes.
   She admits that coming into this town with a nationally known
name didn't hurt her chances for success. But she thinks she had to
have more than just a pretty, recognizable face _ and $2 million
legs.
   ``You know, you're putting it all on the line when you come in
here as a co-headliner,'' she said. ``There's no way of hiding it.
But I wanted to do it. I was both exhilarated and intimidated by
the experience.''
   Her song-and-dance debut has given her a new appreciation of the
people she covers on `ET.'
   ``There's a lot of rejection and hard knocks. I'm far more
appreciative for having experienced it firsthand.''
   Hart admits to something of a Walter Mitty lifestyle since her
days in South Dakota. She's been a finalist in the Miss America
Pageant (1971), been a host of ``ET'' for five years, sparred with
David Letterman, sung the National Anthem at Los Angeles Dodgers
games, ridden with the Blue Angels flight team, danced on the Emmy
awards show, injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a
``Circus of the Stars'' performance and been co-host of the
Tournament of Roses Parade coverage and the ``Regis Philbin Show.''
   Despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the
Golden Nugget was one of her toughest gigs.
   ``I prepared for the opening for months,'' she recalled. ``Then
the day of the opening, after working all afternoon in dress
rehearsals, I almost felt like I couldn't do it. I proceeded to cry
for three hours.
   ``Part of it was sheer fear; part of it was excitement. There
were moments of being panic-stricken. But the overriding emotion
was one of exhilaration.
   ``I have really always seen myself as an entertainer,'' she
said. ``You dream those things, but you don't know for sure if
they'll ever happen. I think that was part of my emotionalism,
realizing those things had come true.''
   A few dreams _ a Broadway play and her own TV sitcom _ remain
unfulfilled. But, at age 35, she thinks time is on her side.
   She's learned to roll with the punches, to be patient.
   After doing radio and TV talk shows in Sioux Falls, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, and Oklahoma City, she moved West to headline ``PM
Magazine.'' She left that show to co-host ``Regis Philbin'' _ which
folded four months later.
   ``I was out of work and out of money,'' she recalled. ``That was
a time I was terribly disappointed. Then ET came along. Thank
heaven for my Midwestern upbringing, and positive thinking.
   ``My parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the
good. I've always translated the negative experiences into good in
the long run. I'm a big believer that life goes on. You get back
from life what you put into it.''

<HEAD>Unleashing Some Beastly Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES REINDL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guitarist John Abercrombie stood in a tangle of
foot switches and wires on stage at the Jazz Showcase, nodding
toward a guitar synthesizer and bank of boxes sparkling with
twinkling lights behind him.
   He introduced his next number, adding it would be his last
before he ``unleashed all this beastly equipment.''
   By today's standards of sound processing, it was a
modest-looking collection of electronic wizardry, including his
synthesizer, a digital reverb and delay and a stereo chorus in
addition to his Ibanez guitar and standard power amplifier and
pre-amplifier.
   Yet there was one of the most progressive jazz guitar stylists
feeling his way through the technical forest. It was clear evidence
that music technology can outstrip a musician's ability to adapt it
to his playing.
   ``I like it,'' Abercrombie said of advances in music technology.
``It's frustrating, but definitely it's another instrument. The
synthesizer makes me hear differently. It makes me compose
differently.
   ``It becomes another way to express yourself and that's what you
want to do.''
   Abercrombie and trio mates Peter Erskine on drums and Marc
Johnson on bass were in Chicago recently at the start of a 2{-week
tour of the Midwest, South and East.
   Abercrombie, 43, lives in New York. He's been a force in guitar
improvisation for most of the 20 years he has spent touring the
world.
   Advances in music technology are another step in the evolution
of jazz, which has progressed partly through a oneupsmanship
philosophy, he said in an interview.
   During the be-bop era that was the style du jour.
   ``It wasn't technology, but it's keeping up with the Joneses
until the next cat comes along and says, `I want to do something
different,''' he said.
   Advances in technology also have helped Abercrombie in his own
music.
   ``I think overall, this technology has helped my guitar playing.
I think it has made me a more fluid player and made me appreciate
the guitar more,'' he said.
   Appreciation _ at least popular and commercial appreciation _
still elude Abercrombie, although he claims no hardship.
   A steady player and recording artist for German-based ECM
Records, Abercrombie acknowledges his music isn't easily grasped by
an American public that defines jazz as ``more pop-oriented'' music.
   Abercrombie's playing is easily described as eclectic. A blues
riff might give way to introspective brooding before rising to
rock-level decibels. He'll toss in a hook from a jazz standard for
good measure.
   European jazz fans seem to accept Abercrombie more than their
U.S. counterparts, he says.
   ``I think my music has always been a little off to the weird
side,'' Abercrombie said. ``It's not always music people sit down
and listen to. It all has to do with accessibility.
   ``I think the music I choose to play is less accessible to many
people,'' he said.``It's more important for me and the people I
know to try to expand'' the jazz tradition.
   ``And if that means using technology, I will.''
   But there is a price to pay for relying on the new machines,
said Abercrombie, who counts as his primary influences
traditionalists Wes Montgomery and Jim Hall.
   ``You do realize that synthesizers will drain you if you use
them all the time,'' he said.
   And he has some advice for the wizards who create music
technology:
   ``What I'd like to say is, `Why don't you guys slow down and let
us learn how to play what we've got?' The thing I don't like is
every three months something new comes out.''

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Hollywood stars are beginning to shine for
favored candidates in the June 7 California primary election, but
many Democratic celebrities remain uncommitted in a race
complicated by Jesse Jackson's anti-Jewish image.
   Not that big money isn't being raised. Nor is all the glitter
gone.
   For example, radio personality Casey Kasem and his actress wife,
Jean, are hosts for a celebrity fund-raiser for Jackson on June 5
at trendy Spago restaurant, known for its unconventional California
pizzas.
   Among those expected to attend the $1,000-a-slice, Western-theme
party are Eddie Murphy, Debbie Allen, Hugh Hefner, Herbie Hancock,
Billy Davis Jr. and Marilyn McCoo.
   Hollywood support is often vigorously sought by political
candidates, who know stars attract attention, money and _ they hope
_ voters to a campaign.
   On the Republican side, where the race was over long ago, Cheryl
Ladd, Robert Stack and producer Jerry Weintraub have endorsed Vice
President George Bush, while Frank Sinatra, Tom Selleck, Helen
Hayes, Oscar de la Renta and Yvette Mimieux have made contributions
to his campaign, said Bush's deputy finance chairman, Fred Bush.
   But things are messier among the Democrats.
   So far this season, Sally Field, Oliver Stone, Richard Gere, Ed
Begley Jr., Tony Randall, Carly Simon, Leonard Nimoy and Shelley
Winters have endorsed Michael Dukakis, the Democratic front-runner,
according to the Massachusetts governor's local spokesman, Mike
Devereaux.
   Jackson has attracted many black celebrities to his camp,
including comedians Bill Cosby and Murphy as well as Quincy Jones,
Lou Gossett Jr. and Gladys Knight. And some white performers have
pledged their support, including Valerie Harper, Margot Kidder and
Dennis Weaver.
   However, most Hollywood Democrats _ the show business
community's dominant party _ have yet to endorse either Jackson or
Dukakis.
   ``Hollywood has always been mostly Jewish and liberal,'' said
Alex Ben Block, editor of Show Biz News, a twice-monthly newsletter
covering the business side of the entertainment industry.
   ``From a Jewish point of view, it's almost unconscionable to
support Jackson,'' he said. However, neither is there any public
rush to oppose the black civil rights activist who is the most
liberal candidate in the race.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, said Jews in Hollywood are caught between black friends
who are asking them to consider Jackson and Jewish friends who say
they must oppose him.
   ``People are caught. Anyone who endorses Jesse Jackson will not
be thought of as a hero in the Jewish community,'' Hier said.
   ``Among conservative Jewish people in this industry, Jesse
Jackson is simply unacceptable,'' said Michael Medved, film critic
for PBS' ``Sneak Previews'' and president of the Pacific Jewish
Center. ``The feeling is so intense, friendships would be so
imperiled and business would be imperiled.''
   Jackson alienated many Jews by referring to New York as
``Hymietown'' in 1984, by publicly embracing Yasser Arafat of the
Palestine Liberation Organization and by being associated with
Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan.
   The uncommitted Hollywood group includes such activists as
two-time Oscar winner Jane Fonda and her husband, Assemblyman Tom
Hayden; Norman Lear, Emmy Award-winning producer of television's
``The Archie Bunker Show,'' and Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA Inc.
They were among those on Show Biz News' list of the 10 most
powerful political fund-raisers in Hollywood.
   Lear, whose political organization, ``People for the American
Way,'' mounted a nationwide campaign to defeat the nomination of
Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, is busy with his new
production company, Act III, said his spokeswoman, Betsy Kenny.
   ``When you jump into a presidential campaign, it takes a lot of
work and commitment, and he doesn't feel compelled to do so at this
time,'' Ms. Kenny said.
   Miss Fonda has been in Mexico since January filming ``Old
Gringo'' with co-stars Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits.
   ``She has no plans to endorse anyone before the primary,'' said
spokesman Steve Rivers. ``Her mind is in 1913 (the time period of
the movie). But she says she will support the Democratic nominee.''
   Medved said the Haydens face a ``Catch 22'' with the Jackson
issue: If he and Miss Fonda support Jackson, they risk offending
Hayden's largely Jewish West Los Angeles constituency. If the
couple does not support Jackson, Hayden could find himself at odds
with his political leader, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who is
Jackson's national campaign manager, and with his longtime seatmate
in the Assembly chambers, Assemblyman Tom Bates, who is co-chairman
of Jackson's California campaign.
   Another observer, John Emerson, an official in the Los Angeles
City Attorney's Office who was deputy campaign manager of Gary
Hart's first 1988 presidential campaign, said Jackson is not really
the issue.
   ``Most of the people in Hollywood, both the executives and
celebrities, were either committed to Gary Hart or (Sen.) Joe
Biden. Both those campaigns blew up. There was a sense of not
wanting to be burned again so they wanted to wait out the primary.
But they will throw themselves into the (November) presidential
race,'' said Emerson, who now supports Dukakis.
   Ed Asner is ``on the verge'' of supporting Dukakis, and Telly
Savalas also likes him, said Mike Mamakos, spokesman for both stars.
   Conservative Republicans in Hollywood are few, but the ones who
are active are expected to work for Bush, including Charlton Heston.
   ``He will be supporting Bush, but he won't make an announcement
until after the nomination,'' said Heston's spokesman, Michael
Levine.
   Sylvester Stallone also remains uncommitted, but the tough-guy
star of the ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo'' series ``did vote for Mr.
Reagan, whom he admires greatly,'' said Stallone's spokesman, Paul
Block. ``He hasn't declared yet. But I will say that Mr. Stallone
is a Republican.''
   ``Gov. Michael Dukakis will easly beat out Jesse Jackson in the
Hollywood fund-raising race leading up to the California primary,''
Block said. ``While Hollywood is overwhelmingly Democratic and
liberal, there will also be considerable support for Vice President
George Bush.''

<HEAD>Technology May Help Farmers Cope With Environmental Crackdown,
Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government environmental regulations are
having an impact on the lives of virtually all Americans and are
especially affecting farmers and the way they handle soil and water
resources.
   Farmers should be helped to use the ``tremendous stream of
technology'' coming out of laboratories to work within the
regulatory world, says Jim Spitz, chairman of the Agriculture
Department's new Working Group on Agricultural Chemicals and the
Environment.
   The USDA historically has operated world-class research
facilities. It still does, as the records attest. But in recent
decades the private sector has often been on the cutting edge of
change, leaving USDA to basic research and long-range development.
   Meanwhile, as Americans become more conscious of the natural
environment and how it can be affected by manmade chemicals and use
of resources, new restrictions emerge from local, state and federal
regulators.
   It is high time, many say, that USDA assert its leadership role
and help teach farmers to work within the new system that will
guide them tomorrow, like it or not.
   ``We need to move more aggressively as a department in
technology,'' Spitz said in an interview. ``What we've got to do is
move (on) our technology and our ability to guide producers.
Instead of saying, you can't do this, you can't do that, (we'll
have to say) here's the setting and here's what you can do ...
here's the technology that you need to continue to operate.''
   The USDA can't afford to stand on the sidelines, he said. The
department and the network of land-grant universities and
experiment stations represent ``a major force, a major player'' in
the environmental, technological revolution at hand.
   ``If we're looking at cropland and production agriculture _ and
these regulations are closing in on that _ we really must upgrade
our technology and our capability ... to respond,'' Spitz said.
   But isn't a lot of technology already available to farmers,
making it easier for them to abide by the new state and federal
environmental restrictions?
   ``In some of the newer technologies _ integrated pest
management, biotechnology in genetics _ and in some of the farming
practices themselves, there's quite a bit coming out of applied
research,'' he said. ``We need to get it out into the demonstration
areas and on farms so it's visible to the American producer.''
   So its a rather old and familiar story, at least in the research
establishment, the state and county extension service and among
innovative farmers themselves: if it works and can make money,
it'll catch on.
   ``If it's going to be accepted, profit is the bottom line,''
Spitz said.
   The USDA group that Spitz heads was formed in early February.
Among its purposes is to review USDA policies regarding
agricultural chemicals and report on the effectiveness and
appropriateness of those policies.
   Another goal will be to develop ``appropriate strategies'' for
carrying out new or amended policies relating to farm chemicals and
the environment.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers, Spitz's boss and USDA's second
in command, told a House subcommittee last week that the
department's Agricultural Research Service has adopted two new
groundwater strategies for pesticides and nitrates.
   In the case of pesticides, Myers said, the agency plan calls for
specific areas of research, including the use of minimum or
conservation tillage practices, computer models to help select the
best farm management practices, integrated pest management,
improved pesticide application, water and pesticide management for
irrigated or poorly drained cropland and new technologies for
pesticide analysis and decontamination.
   Myers told the House panel that the strategic plan for nitrates
``recognizes the important role nitrogen fertilizers play in modern
agriculture and provides a balanced approach that allows their
continued use in crop production in a manner that minimizes the
movement of nitrogen into ground water.''
   Environmental advocates have often criticized heavy fertilizer
use as a source of pollution from water running off fields into
streams.
   Myers said USDA conservation programs also have elevated water
quality into a top priority. The 1985 farm law, he said, set up the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, for converting
highly erodible cropland to protective grass or trees for 10 years.
   The CRP and other provisions ``will significantly reduce
sediment from cropland that previously entered the nation's streams
and rivers,'' Myers said. ``It has been estimated that sediment
pollution from cropland can be reduced as much as 30 to 40 percent
annually by these provisions.''
   Further, he said, as sediment levels are lowered, pesticides and
nutrients attached to those particles will be reduced.

<HEAD>African National Congress Attracts Some South African Whites</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Despite repeated setbacks, the
African National Congress presses on with military and underground
efforts to unseat the apartheid government. Some of its new
guerrilla recruits are young whites.
   ``There is a continuing trend of young, well-educated liberal
and left-wing whites to identify themselves with the ANC,'' said
Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the
Witwatersrand and an expert on the ANC.
   Increasingly, he added, the whites see the organization as ``a
legitimate and morally admirable political force.''
   Police say they have seized ANC whites with caches of arms,
arrested another in a car bombing and charged at least one with
treason.
   But ANC military activities have diminished.
   In the past year, bombings in South Africa have declined, police
have claimed major breakthroughs against ANC guerrillas, and even
the organization's leaders have conceded that its military actions
were more effective during the widespread unrest of 1984-86.
   ANC guerrillas generally operate in small groups and have little
hope of scoring conventional victories against South Africa's
powerful security forces. However, the ANC says its bombing and
sabotage campaign remains an essential element of its multi-pronged
strategy to oust the white-led government.
   ``We must step up our attacks on the police, the army and other
personnel associated with the institution (government),'' ANC
President Oliver Tambo said in March in neighboring, black-governed
Zimbabwe. ``We will strike against its economic infrastructure and
do much more intensively what we have been doing all the time.''
   However, the talk has not been matched by action.
   Two years ago, the ANC was claiming that it had enough popular
support in South Africa to direct a ``people's power'' campaign
that would make the country ungovernable.
   But since the government imposed a nationwide state of emergency
in June 1986, black unrest has dwindled from daily outbursts across
the country to sporadic, isolated incidents. ANC activity has
declined simultaneously.
   Fifty bombings were reported in the first year of the emergency
but only about 20 in the past 11 months. Police say that since the
beginning of 1987 they have killed 54 suspected ANC members and
captured 525, inflicting major setbacks to ANC operations inside
South Africa.
   ``Terrorists who are sent to the republic (South Africa) are
going on suicide missions, because confrontation with the security
forces means either certain death or a long period of
imprisonment,'' said Adriaan Vlok, the government's law and order
minister.
   However, the recent defeats do not appear to have hampered the
ANC's ability to recruit members into its military wing, known as
Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation).
   ``People don't join the ANC if they are worried about
setbacks,'' said Tom Sebina, a spokesman at ANC headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia. ``People have joined _ and they continue to join _
because they are committed to our liberation struggle.''
   The ANC refuses to say what its membership is, but it is
variously estimated at 4,000 to 10,000 men with military training,
most of whom are in camps in Tanzania and Angola. No more than a
few hundred are believed to be inside South Africa.
   Whites always have had some role in ANC political activities,
some of them in its upper echelons, but spokesman Sebina said the
involvement of young whites has been growing in the 1980s, though
he declined to give any figures.
   When police arrested four whites May 8 at a farmhouse outside
Pretoria, they claimed their largest arms seizure ever. The whites
had a Soviet-made SAM-7 ground-to-air missile, limpet mines, hand
grenades, machine guns, mortars and explosives, the police said.
   The leading suspect in a car bombing that killed three people
March 17 is a 24-year-old white man whose father is a university
journalism professor.
   In Cape Town, Jenny Schreiner, a 31-year-old white whose father
is a university administrator, is on trial with 12 black
co-defendants charged with treason and terrorism.
   The government portrays the ANC as a communist-led terrorist
group that kills civilians and lacks widespread support and
political legitimacy.
   ``The conviction that the ANC is conducting a futile struggle is
already taking root in the their ranks,'' said Vlok, the law and
order minister.
   The government also claims the ANC is torn by internal strife,
that numerous of its defectors have joined the South African police
force and that the ANC keeps its dissidents in at an ``inhuman''
detention camp in northern Angola.
   Sebina denied those claims.
   He said South African agents, not internal ANC feuding, were
behind the six killings this year of ANC officials living outside
South Africa. He disclaimed any knowledge of recent defections by
ranking ANC members and said the organization did not maintain
detention camps for dissidents.
   ``The government has been making similar noises for a long
time,'' said Sebina. ``They said our back was broken when we were
outlawed (in 1960). They said the same thing when (Nelson) Mandela
was arrested (in 1962). One or two defeats will not end our
struggle.''
   Mandela, the ANC leader at the time of his arrest, is in prison
but remains a rallying point for the organization and the large
majority of blacks.
   Founded in 1912 as a black rights movement, the ANC took up arms
in 1961, the year after it was banned, saying it was left with no
alternative.
   It is the largest black group fighting the government, and it is
widely believed that the ANC would win national elections if the
country's 26 million blacks were allowed to vote.
   The ANC has offices in many African nations as well as Eastern
and Western Europe in hopes of advancing its political fortunes.
   The ANC has been drawing up a new set of guidelines for a
post-apartheid constitution that is reported to be their most
detailed political document ever.
   The Weekly Mail newspaper of Johannesburg said the proposal
calls for a mixed economy, a bill of rights and a multi-party
government. It also calls for equalizing wealth, a sensitive issue
in a country where blacks make up about 75 percent of the
population but own less than 2 percent of the country's fixed
assets.
   The most contentious issue involving the ANC remains its use of
violence. The government says it won't talk to the ANC until it
lays down its arms. The ANC says the arms are necessary to bring
the government into genuine negotiations.
   ``There has been no reassessment of the armed struggle,'' said
Sebina. ``There are still bombs exploding here and there, and I'm
sure there will be more of them.''

<DATELINE>SKOBALJ, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radisa Petrovic, a farmer's son, left
this sleepy village for college 10 years ago with dreams of ``a
normal life'' _ having a car and an apartment in the city.
   What he didn't know then, however, was that his country's
economy would falter under the weight of heavy borrowing, bad
investment and a mounting debt.
   Today he is back on the farm, one of millions of young Yugoslavs
forced to depend on their parents for economic survival.
   Petrovic, 30, who married a law student at the university in
nearby Belgrade, now is driving his father's old Soviet-made car.
   His wife, Tanja, has joined more than 1 million Yugoslavs who
are out of work, staying at home with an 18-month-old daughter
instead of defending court cases.
   As an agrarian manager on a state-run pig farm, Petrovic earns
an above-average 370,000 dinar ($250) a month.
   It doesn't go far in an inflation of 170 percent and an economy
burdened by a $21 billion foreign debt the Communist government is
strapped to pay.
   ``My monthly salary lasts three days,'' joked Petrovic. ``Twenty
if I'm really economical. After that, Papa must come with his
money.''
   The Petrovics rarely eat out. The traditional vacation on the
Adriatic will happen this year only if a relative lends them a
seaside home and the couple finds the money to repair the Soviet
car.
   On the surface, life in Yugoslavia sometimes seems blissfully
untouched by the economic woes.
   Bars and cafes in Belgrade, the capital, are always full. The
young dress with style. Cars and Western gadgets are conspicuous.
   Behind that facade, however, living standards have dropped
one-third since 1980 when Yugoslavs thought they had something to
look ahead to.
   The inflation that Premier Branko Mikulic has called a
destructive evil is eating away at the fragile infrastructure of a
nation constantly troubled by ethnic tensions among peoples divided
in six different republics and using two different alphabets, Roman
and cyrillic.
   Many of Yugoslavia's 23 million citizens depend for survival on
the only structures left intact _ the traditional bonds between
family and friends, and age-old ties to the land.
   ``People who live with their parents live much better than those
who don't,'' Petrovic told a visitor. ``Being dependent on your
parents, you have a chance to sit in a car, live a bit normally. If
you separate ... forget a car, forget a TV, forget everything.''
   The 300 families of Skobalj are relatively well off on the
fertile land along the Danube southeast of Belgrade. But even they
say times are getting hard, and they angrily criticize the
Communist hierarchy's policy of curbing farming output.
   ``This is the worst situation I can remember,'' said Borivoje
Stojadinovic, 65, who has farmed here all his life.
   Sitting out on his porch, sipping coffee with visitors,
Stojadinovic recalled selling a bull in 1938 for 4,000 dinars.
   ``You could have bought half the village,'' he said.
   Now, 4,000 dinars is barely worth $3.
   A decade ago, Stojadinovic added, the sale of a bull provided
his home with a refrigerator and washing machine.
   Now, he added, ``I'd need two bulls _ one for each.''
   He and his wife Radmila, 62, sold two of their 17 acres of land
years back to finance the education of their two daughters, one now
a doctor and the other an engineer in different Serbian cities.
   Both are married. But both still depend on their increasingly
frail parents to survive.
   ``I can't send money,'' the father said. ``But just the other
day I sent one of them a nice, fat pig.''
   The Stojadinovics would like to lease out land they can't farm
for extra cash. Down the lane, Dusan Pantic would like to rent it
to graze his prize-winning cows and expand the farm he runs with
his wife and son.
   But the rent Pantic would be able to pay wouldn't cover taxes
and other state levies, Stojadinovic said. Communist authorities
curb expansion for successful farmers like Pantic, forbidding any
peasant to farm more than 25 acres of land.
   Former university student Petrovic, sitting at the kitchen table
of his father's farmhouse, railed against such rules.
   ``They should take a look at what the Western world did with
agriculture,'' he said. A prize cow in Yugoslavia, he added, yields
less than one quarter of the milk of an average cow in the United
States.
   Ninety percent of Yugoslavia's agriculture is in the hands of
private farmers like Petrovic's father.
   ``But there are no good, stimulating measures for private
producers here,'' Petrovic said, advocating new measures to create
bigger, more efficient farms.
   Like many other reforms in Yugoslavia, planned improvements in
farming have run awry. Petrovic cited a plan to give loans to
farmers whose investments yield slow returns and who must sell
produce to the state at prices that lag behind inflation.
   ``The wrong people got the credits,'' Petrovic said. ``They have
nothing to do with agriculture and just use the money to build
houses and buy cars.''
   Asked why, Petrovic flashed the knowing smile of someone
accustomed to a nation where connections and power open doors.
   ``We have some strange laws,'' he said. ``The law here is not a
law if there are no exceptions.''
   A few miles up river in the village of Grocka, the wealth of
local officials is on show. Mercedes cars sit in the driveways of
their weekend homes and in the parking lot of a local restaurant
favored by the late President Josip Broz Tito.
   The only other people not suffering around Skobalj are those who
went off to work in the West, like a million other Yugoslavs, and
have returned to build brick houses.
   ``Most of the people who went abroad in earlier years were poor
and uneducated,'' Petrovic said. ``They went because of the hard
economic situation for them. Now, they are coming back richer and
cleverer than all the people left here.''
   He said a schoolfriend went to France years ago to play handball.
   ``Now, he drives a Porsche.''

   When an assassin took Robert F. Kennedy's
life 20 years ago, robbing the nation of a rising leader, he also
stole the father from 11 children _ the oldest 16, the youngest not
yet born.
   While drugs and other personal tragedies have torn at some of
their lives, destroying one, many of the children of Robert and
Ethel Kennedy have gone on to embrace their father's ideals and
pick up his torch of public service.
   ``This is how they're dealing with'' their father's death, said
David F. Powers, curator at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston
and a longtime Kennedy family friend.
   ``They think (public service) is the way. They have the same
compassion for the underprivileged that their father had. ... They
care.''
   The Kennedy children remember their father for his dedication to
the country, his sense of discipline, his love for life.
   ``I remember when my uncle (John Kennedy) died, one of the
family rituals was discussing current events, and we often had to
write something about what was taking plce on the front pages of
the papers,'' recalled Michael Kennedy, 30, the sixth of the RFK
children.
   ``I remember my father turning to my older siblings and telling
them to write down the significance of this event on the United
States and history. That must have taken a tremendous amount of
self-discipline for such a personal event. Yet we always had _
going skiing, rafting _ just so many fun times as well.
   ``Thinking about raising my own family, these are the thoughts
that go through your mind,'' said Michael, who with his wife,
Victoria, a daughter of sports commentator Frank Gifford, has three
children.
   His sisters and brothers are: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 36;
Joseph P. Kennedy III, 35; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 34; Courtney
Kennedy Ruhe, 31; Kerry Kennedy, 28; Christopher Kennedy, 24; Max
Kennedy, 23; Douglas Kennedy, 21; and Rory Kennedy, 19. David
Kennedy was 28 when he died in 1984.
   Michael, who like his father attended Harvard and the University
of Virginia Law School, runs Citizens Energy Corp., the non-profit
oil company started by brother Joe to help the poor get low-cost
heat.
   ``Growing up in my family, it was clear that you had to give
something back, not only to your family and your community, but
your country. Whether that came directly from my father, or as much
from my mother, I guess it's a basic Christian attitude,'' Michael
said.
   He took over Citizens Energy after Joe two years ago won the
Massachusetts congressional seat once held by their uncle Jack and
their grandfather. Michael was a fund-raiser for the campaign.
   Rep. Kennedy has been asked by his mother to deliver the eulogy
at a memorial Mass on Monday at RFK's gravesite at the Arlington
National Cemetery, said aide Chuck McDermott. Kennedy refused
repeated requests for an interview. He and his wife, Sheila Rauch,
have twins.
   Ethel Kennedy presides over the family estate, Hickory Hill,
located in this Washington suburb and has organized memorials. She
generally prefers to have her children speak for the family.
   Daughter Kathleen, a Maryland lawyer, said her father ``believed
that politics is an honorable profession, and I think that's why so
many of his children are interested in politics. He believed that
we should each do our best. He had a sense of justice and
injustice, and if things were wrong one should not just sit idly
by, but do something about it.''
   She said she will likely run for office again following her 1986
congressional defeat to a Republican incumbent. Meanwhile, she
directs a community service program for high school students at the
Maryland Department of Education. Chairwoman of the Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Foundation, she is married to professor David
Townsend and they have three children.
   Kerry Kennedy, a Boston College Law School graduate, was field
director of her brother's 1986 campaign. Earlier this year, she
created the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights at the
foundation to work on projects with the winners of the foundation's
annual human rights awards.
   ``It is a way,'' she said, ``of carrying forth the ideals of the
winners and the ways that they shared my father's vision,'' which
she described as one of ``love and compassion and justice.''
   
   The center sent a delegation to South Korea earlier this year to
meet with human rights leaders and government officials. Among
other planned projects are a series of medical clinics in Poland.
   ``My father believed in action,'' Kerry said.
   She's leaving her position as treasurer of her brother's
campaign to Courtney Kennedy Ruhe, who lives in Manhattan with her
husband of eight years, David Ruhe.
   Not all of Robert Kennedy's children have entered public
service, and some have been crushed by tragedy.
   The slaying of RFK ``totally devastated the family,'' but struck
at the oldest boys the hardest, said David Horowitz, co-author of
``The Kennedys: An American Drama.''
   In April 1984, an overdose of painkillers, tranquilizers and
cocaine killed David Kennedy, who some say was alone in a hotel
room watching news reports the night his father was gunned down
June 5, 1968.
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pleaded guilty to heroin possession in
1983, received a two-year suspended sentence and spent time in a
drug-treatment center.
   Today, he is an environmental law attorney in New York and is
teaching at Pace University. Kennedy and his wife of six years,
Emily Black, also a lawyer, have two children. A foundation
spokeswoman said he was not granting interviews.
   Some of the clan were just infants or pre-schoolers when their
father was killed.
   Christopher Kennedy worked on his brother's campaign. The Boston
College graduate last year married Sheila Berner and is working at
the family-owned Merchandise Mart in Chicago.
   Max Kennedy is about to graduate from Harvard as a history major.
   Douglas Kennedy, who has completed his sophomore year at Boston
College, has been involved in homeless issues, working with
activist Mitch Snyder.
   Rory Kennedy, a Brown University freshman who was born six
months after the assassination, has worked with Kerry on the human
rights center.

   The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly rapid
annual rate of 3.9 percent from January through March, much better
than previously believed, the government said.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was
propelled during the first three months of the year by an export
surge, a rebound in car sales and a boom in business capital
investment.
   The report represented a sharp upward revision from an initial
estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3
percent rate in the first quarter.

   The report released Thursday by New York University Professor

   Oil futures prices advanced on technical market
factors in what analysts said was the heaviest trading volume in
recent weeks.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, contracts for July
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
rose 17 cents to close at $17.54 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 0.63 cent to settle at 52.35 cents a gallon, while
wholesale heating oil closed at 48.19 cents a gallon, up 0.88 cent.
   ``It was the biggest volume we've had in the energy market for
several weeks, if not longer,'' said Peter Beutel, an assistant
director at Elders Futures Inc.
   Analysts said oil prices advanced slowly throughout the session
but made a more dramatic rise in the last half-hour of trading.
   Beutel said it appeared that July crude had been trying to fall
below the psychologically important $17.30-a-barrel level for
several days. When it became clear prices were not going to fall,
traders had to scramble to cover their positions, he said.
   Fundamentally, however, ``there was nothing to indicate lower
supplies or greater demand,'' Beutel said.
   Seasonal buying of gasoline partly explained the rise in
unleaded gas prices. Heavier purchases are typical ahead of the
summer driving season, which runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
   ``We always see the best gas demand in summer,'' Beutel noted.

<HEAD>Porsche Comes in First in Car Quality Survey; Three GM Makes Reach
Top 10</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>

   Porsche placed first in an annual survey naming
the 10 most trouble-free cars, while three General Motors Corp.
models made the list, two of them for the first time.
   The J.D. Power and Associates car quality survey was mailed to
75,000 owners of new 1988 model cars purchased in November and
December and asked for the number of problems experienced during
the first 90 days. The survey results were announced Thursday.
   More than 30,000 owners answered the 1988 survey, said Bruce
Johnson, senior project director for the Agoura Hills, Calif.,
consulting firm.
   The results: Porsche topped the list of most trouble-free cars
with 111 problems reported per 100 cars. Porsche cars came in sixth
in 1987.
   Bumped to the second spot by Porsche was Mercedes-Benz, a fellow
West German automaker whose owners reported 115 problems per 100
cars in 1988, up from 108 in 1987, when it placed first.
   Toyota and Nissan tied for third place with 122 problems per 100
cars, an improvement for both. In 1987, Nissan was third with 125
problems and Toyota was fourth with 129.
   Honda's upscale Acura line slipped to fifth in 1988 from second
in 1987. Owners reported 138 problems per 100 cars in 1988, up from
117 in 1987.
   Daihatsu, which ranked as the sixth most trouble-free car,
barely made it into the 1988 survey, Johnson said, because the
company began selling cars in the United States in December.
Daihatsu owners reported 141 problems per 100 cars.
   GM's Cadillac, with 143 problems per 100 cars was seventh, while
Buick, with 153, was eighth and Oldsmobile, with 157, placed ninth.
Cadillac and Oldsmobile made the list for the first time since J.D.
Powers began the survey in 1985.
   No American models made the list in 1987.
   Honda's other lines fell to No. 10, with 158 problems per 100
cars compared to the 130 problems that put the company in fifth
place in 1987.
   Mazda, Subaru, BMW and Mitsubishi, which ranked seventh through
10th in 1987, did not make the list this year. J.D. Powers reports
only the top 10 rankings, and in 1987, it announced the number of
trouble reports for only the top five cars.
   ``We discovered there is a relationship between customer
satisfaction and the problems that owners experience,'' Johnson
said.
   He said results of the short-term car quality survey have been
mirrored in the J.D. Power Customer Satisfaction Index, a rating of
dealers produced by surveying owners 12 months after their purchase.
   The CSI is important to auto dealers because auto manufacturers
use it to determine which dealers receive hot new models, new car
lines or even new brands.
   Dealers have complained that the CSI reflects problems with
vehicles more than problems with dealers, making dealers suffer for
manufacturers mistakes.
   Johnson said both dealer and vehicle quality play in the CSI
ratings.
   ``The more problems, the more pressure on the dealer to fix the
car,'' he said, adding that previous survey shows about 50 percent
of the problems customers bring back to dealerships are repaired.

   BankAmerica Corp. remains ``a few more
quarters'' of operating profitability away from restoring the
dividend the beleaguered banking giant dropped in 1985, its
chairman said.
   But A.W. Clausen painted an upbeat picture of prospects for the
nation's third-largest bank holding company at BankAmerica's annual
shareholders meeting Thursday.
   ``BankAmerica is on the road to recovery,'' Clausen said at a
news conference preceding the meeting.
   ``Our turnaround was grounded on a realistic plan to focus on
core objectives, to improve the performance of the credit
portfolio, and to bring our expenses and revenues into profitable
alignment,'' he said.
   As proof of the recovery, Clausen pointed to a 62 percent
increase in first-quarter 1988 profit, decreases in net credit
losses over the past six quarters, and reduced expenses from
operations and the sale of nonstrategic businesses.
   Clausen also noted reductions in core business expenses, such as
personnel, and increases in net interest income during 1987 and
strengthening of the bank's primary capital ratio over the past six
quarters.
   ``Our challenge is to improve fundamental net income on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, to bring in each quarter's fundamental
earnings at a higher level than the previous quarter, and to extend
the recent track record of solid and continuous profitability,'' he
said.
   Clausen, a former head of the World Bank who returned as chief
executive of BankAmerica in late 1986, drew a salary of $775,000
last year.
   BankAmerica stock closed 12.5 cents higher at $10.375 a share in
composite trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In 1987, BankAmerica reported a net loss of $955 million, which
followed a 1986 loss of $518 million. The company recorded a profit
for the first time in six quarters in the third period of 1987,
posting net income of $54 million.
   For the first quarter of 1988, the company reported net income
of $109 million, or 56 cents a share, up from a profit of $67
million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. The company reported
higher earnings for the third straight quarter.

   Field Corp. announced that its Field Publications
affiliate will acquire all of the stock of Funk & Wagnalls Inc., a
major publisher of encyclopedias and other reference books.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, Field spokeswoman Virginia
Butts said Thursday. The New York Times, in today's editions, says
an unnamed industry expert estimated the price at $70 million to
$100 million.
   The transaction is expected to be closed next Tuesday, Butts
said.
   Funk & Wagnalls, based in Ramsey, N.J., is the second-largest
general reference encyclopedia publisher in the United States and
Canada ranked by sales, behind World Book. The company has annual
revenue of around $50 million, according to the Times.
   Funk & Wagnalls' main business is selling mass-market
encyclopedias, yearbooks, family health guides and other reference
books through supermarkets and direct marketing.
   The privately held company is owned by an investment group that
includes its management.
   The acquisition will provide Field with a new means of product
distribution, said Field President Bruce Seide.
   Field Publications, formerly Xerox Education Publications, is
based in Middletown, Conn., and markets publications to schools,
students and individual consumers. Its main products are book clubs
and the 60-year-old Weekly Reader classroom newspaper.
   Chicago-based Field Corp., owned by Marshall Field 5th, bought
its publications affiliate from Xerox Corp. in 1985.

<HEAD>Cable Study Says Industry A Rising Star</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cable television industry will contribute
about $32 billion to the gross national product during 1988 and
provide some 490,000 jobs, a report commissioned by a cable-related
company says.
   The study was done by Browne, Bortz & Coddington Inc., a Denver
research firm, after being commissioned by Bill Daniels, chairman
of Daniels & Associates, a major cable TV financial services
company based in Denver.
   The study updated a 1986 report prepared by the same company
which also was sponsored by Daniels.
   The cable industry in the United States has continued to grow
rapidly over the past two years with annual revenue now around
$12.8 billion, a 24.3 percent increase since 1986, the report said.
   The industry provides 87,600 direct jobs, and cable-related work
provides an additional 60,000 jobs. Another 340,000 jobs are
created indirectly, according to he report.
   Cable-related employment expanded at a lower rate than either
economic output or employee income during that time, and the report
concluded that ``economic output per employee increased over the
past two years, resulting in fewer employees per dollar of economic
output.''
   The study said cable came of age during the late 1980s with half
of all U.S. households now subscribing to cable service; 75 percent
of the subscribers now have access to 30 or more program channels;
15 percent have access to 54 or more.
   Cable-originated programming makes up almost 40 percent of
viewing in the average cable home, the report said, while viewing
of network-affiliated broadcast stations dropped 12 percent in the
past five years.
   ``Our country is in the midst of a communications revolution,''
Daniels said. ``During this decade, all media and communications
industries grew rapidly, but cable television has been the star
performer.''
   The study said that in revenue terms, cable television ranks
ahead of motion picture box office, radio, home video and broadcast
network advertising.

   In an unprecedented move, federal regulators
ordered the makers of the anti-acne medicine Accutane to warn
customers of potential birth defects by using a picture of a
deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   ``It is an attempt to emphasize to people that we're not talking
about a remote risk of some minor birth defect ... but a very high
risk of extremely severe birth defects that can, in effect, make
the child unable to function,'' says U.S. Food and Drug
Adminstration spokesman William Grigg.
   Among other requirements, the FDA will force female patients to
sign a consent form stating they understand the risks associated
with the powerful drug, according to Carolyn R. Glynn, a
spokeswoman for the drug's manufacturer, Hoffman-La Roche of Nutley.
   Grigg says the requirements were prompted by 62 reported cases
of birth defects caused by the drug since it was introduced in
1982, though the FDA believes the actual number is much higher. The
FDA says the risk of a pregnant Accutane user having a deformed
child is one in four or greater.
   The requirements follow a recommendation by an FDA advisory
panel of outside experts that the prescription drug remain on the
market. It is considered the only effective treatment for severe,
scarring acne.
   Grigg said the requirement that Hoffman-La Roche include a
photograph of an infant deformed by the drug was ``unprecedented.''
   Ms. Glynn said the company basically agrees with the FDA's
order, which does not stray much from the advisory panel's
recommendations, but Hoffman-La Roche believes the photo ``may be
more appropriate ... to use on the patient consent materials''
signed in the doctor's office.
   ``It's not an issue of using the picture, it's where you use the
picture,'' she said.
   The spokeswoman said Hoffman-La Roche received the FDA's
requirements Wednesday in a letter dated May 19. The FDA left it to
Hoffman-La Roche to release the order or keep it confidential, she
said. The company released the letter Thursday.
   Grigg said Thursday that ``there's still some negotiating room''
if Hoffman-La Roche seeks to alter some of the requirements.
   The advisory panel and the FDA embraced a proposal by Hoffman-La
Roche to sell Accutane only in a package in which explicit patient
warnings _ including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a red X
through it _ would be sealed under clear plastic at the factory to
make sure the patient would see them.
   Ms. Glynn said the company, which must respond to the FDA's
letter within 15 days, hopes to have the patient consent kit on the
market by late June, and have the so-called blister packaging in
drug stores no later than September.
   The company also will pay the costs of birth control counseling
and pregnancy tests for women who use the drug, she said.
   Since its introduction, Accutane has carried specific and
explicit warnings about the high risk that it will cause birth
defects if taken during pregnancy.
   Those warnings were strengthened in recent years, but the FDA
grew concerned that too many women, and perhaps doctors, were
ignoring them.
   Most of the 62 birth defects reported to the FDA _ including
disfiguring facial deformitites, severe mental retardation and
heart defects _ occurred in the first two years of the medicine's
use, when the warnings were less severe. Many of the children died
within a year of birth, Grigg said.
   Though the advisory panel concluded the benefits of Accutane
outweighed its risks, some government and health experts called for
a total ban on the drug.

   The dollar ended the week marginally higher against
the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while stock prices dipped for the
second consecutive trading day.
   The dollar closed at 124.64 yen, up 0.14 yen from its finish on
Thursday. It opened at 124.61 yen and moved between 124.58-125.66
yen during the day.
   ``Participants stayed away from making major moves in
anticipation that the United States might raise its official
interest rates to cool the economy, following the announcement of a
higher growth rate for the U.S. gross national product,'' said an
official of a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   It was reported Thursday that the U.S. gross national product
had grown by 3.9 percent in the first three months of the year, up
from 2.3 percent originally reported.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which slipped a modest 15.41 points Thursday, lost
another 137.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to finish the day's trading
at 27,290.49.
   ``Share prices went down sharply just before the end of the
afternoon session led by profit-taking in pharmaceutical issues,''
said Masahiro Umemori of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   The fear of rising inflation in the United States was strong
among investors, he added.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion shares,
up from the 1.1 billion shares traded Thursday.
   Traders attributed the high volume figure to active trading in
large capital issues, such as heavy industrials and steels.

   A proposed treaty that would remove most
tariff barriers between the United States and Canada probably would
increase trade between the two countries but leave some U.S.
industries at a competitive disadvantage, a private study says.
   The study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research group
established by members of Congress, found that ``the impact of the
proposed agreement likely would be uneven, with some industries
gaining and others losing.''
   The report, released Thursday, said that the automotive and
textile industries would be the big losers under the treaty, now
being considered by committees in the House and Senate.
   In both the automobile and textile industries, Canadian tariffs
would be retained during a phase-out period stretching up to 10
years, making it harder for U.S. industries to compete, the study
said. The treaty also would allow Canada to establish new barriers
in the textile sector, the study noted.
   On the other hand, the study said, industrial machinery,
electronics and energy-intensive industries in the United States
would benefit from the agreement, in part because of already low
Canadian tariffs or more rapid removal of duties under the treaty.
   ``The stakes are high for Northeastern and Midwestern states,
where about 72 percent of total trade between the two countries
occurs,'' the study said.
   About half the 2 million U.S. jobs that are dependent upon
exports to Canada are located within 12 states, nine of them in the
Northeast-Midwest region, the study said.
   In 1986, Canadian exports to the region totaled $49 billion,
which was about 72 percent of all Canadian shipments to the United
States, the study said. The region exported $33 billion in goods
and services to Canada, representing about 73 percent of all U.S.
shipments to Canada.
   The study found that New England states would benefit from
improved access to cheap Canadian hydroelectric power and a better
chance to compete in the service sector.
   The mid-Atlantic states, New York in particular, would benefit
from lower prices for Canadian raw materials, but would be hurt by
the continuation of Canadian restrictive technical standards for
telecommunications equipment, the study said.
   The Midwest, Michigan in particular, would be hurt by continued
barriers that give Canada a competitive edge in the automotive
industry, the study said. However, lower raw material costs would
increase the manufacturers' ``ability to be price competitive in
world markets,'' the study said.
   The Northeast-Midwest Institute serves senators and
representatives of 18 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.

Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International and the Wire
Service Guild announced that they have reached tentative agreement
on a new, one-year contract, although details of the pact were not
disclosed.
   The proposed pact was reached more than a year after the old
contract expired.
   Kevin Keane, guild administrator and president, said the terms
of the new contact will not be released until after union members
are notified by mail next week.
   The contract is subject to ratification by UPI's guild members.
   UPI Chairman Earl W. Brian said in a statement: ``We are
encouraged by the thrust of the tentative agreement which, if
ratified, would allow UPI to move toward a sound and stable
financial future.''
   The agreement was reached by a new guild negotiating team that
came on after another team quit May 9 in a dispute with the guild's
executive committee, which includes union members from UPI's rival
news service, The Associated Press.
   Job security and maintenance of an agency shop were major issues
in the talks, Keane said.
   The contract covers about 700 editorial and other employees of
UPI, Keane said.
   Negotiations toward a new contract had been carried out over the
course of a year.
   The old contract expired in April 1987. The company declared an
impasse in the talks on Nov. 1, 1987, and imposed the terms of its
own contract proposal, UPI spokesman Christopher Smith said.
   Three months later, operating control of UPI was transferred
from Mexican publisher Mario Vazquez Rana to WNW Group, a media
investment company chaired by Brian, with Paul Steinle as president.

   Dissidents are suing the Teamsters union over
its acceptance of a new nationwide contract with the trucking
industry despite rejection of the accord by 63.5 percent of voting
affected members.
   Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a Detroit-based dissident
faction with ties to consumer advocate Ralph Nader, filed suit
Thursday in U.S. District Court here seeking to nullify the
ratification vote earlier this month and prevent the new labor
contract from going into effect.
   The suit claims a 1961 provision in the union's constitution
requiring a two-thirds vote for authorizing a strike was illegally
interpreted as negating the need for a ``yes'' majority to accept
the new three-year accord.
   ``This conclusion of the IBT (International Brotherhood of
Teamsters) that one-third of the involved members may approve a
contract and compel their fellow workers to be bound by it is a
plain violation of the IBT constitution,'' the suit said.
   Even if such an interpretation were valid, it added, the union
illegally ``attempted to obtain ratification by gerrymandering the
electorate to deny the franchise to many members covered by the
agreement while giving ballots to many other members not covered
... and refusing to count many ballots.''
   The Teamsters announced a week ago that it was accepting the new
National Master Freight Agreement covering some 200,000 workers
nationwide even though the ratification vote was 64,101 to 36,782
against it.
   It was the first time in the union's history that a majority of
voting rank-and-file drivers and warehouse workers covered by the
agreement had rejected a contract negotiated by Teamster leaders.
   ``Since the constitution requires that the final offer be
accepted as a result of failure to reject by two-thirds vote, any
strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and
have serious consequences,'' Jack Yager, the chairman of the
union's negotiation committee, said in a statement.
   Yager said 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not
returned, indicating those members were satisfied with the offer.
``If not, they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract,'' he
said.
   However, he and other Teamster officials have acknowledged the
widespread dissension over the accord and are seeking to reopen
talks with the industry's chief bargaining arm, Trucking Management
Inc.
   According to leaders of the dissident faction and other local
Teamster leaders, the opposed provisions include measures requiring
drivers to pay for excess insurance premiums based on their
accident records and damaged freight or equipment if gross
negligence is proved.
   Widespread rank-and-file opposition also was voiced to a measure
in which workers would be required to give up 15 percent of their
pay if 75 percent of the affected employees of a losing company
approved the concession.
   Chip Roth, a spokesman for the union, said no officials were
available to comment on the suit, which was filed late Thursday
afternoon.
   The new contract provides annual 35-cent-an-hour wage gains over
the next three years, raising the current base rate for truck
drivers from $14.71 an hour to $15.06 an hour retroactive to April
1.

<HEAD>Modifications Proposed For Older Boeing 737s</HEAD>

   The government is proposing modifications to
older Boeing 737s to help the aging aircraft stand up against the
corrosion and crack problems discovered after the breakup of an
Aloha Airlines jet last month.
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday issued two
proposed ``airworthiness directives'' designed to serve as
long-term solutions to the structural problems identified after a
20-foot section of the Aloha plane tore away during flight on April
28.
   While some ongoing intensified inspections would be required
under the proposed rules, airlines could avoid even more intensive
and costly inspections once they completed the modifications.
   ``We're giving the airlines what we call a `terminating action,'
something they can do so they don't have to continue to do these
very expensive, repetitive inspections,'' FAA spokesman Fred Farrar
said of the proposed modifications.
   The rules cover, in varying degrees, the first 464 of the 737s
built, but only an estimated 100 of those aircraft now are being
operated by U.S. airlines.
   The repairs were expected to take about 2,000 work hours per
plane, with the total cost for work on the 100 planes operated by
U.S. carriers estimated at $8 million.
   ``This proposal is prompted by reports of numerous cracks found
during inspections of airplanes that have accumulated more than
40,000 landings,'' one of the FAA proposals states. ``This
condition, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of
the airplane.''
   The Aloha jetliner was 19 years old and had made nearly 89,000
landings.
   The proposed modifications would involve using rivets rather
than bonding agents to attach metal tear strips that join pieces of
the fuselage. They also would require the replacement of certain
countersunk rivets with larger rivets that have protruding heads.
The heads of countersunk rivets are set at or below the surface
into which they are driven.
   The countersunk rivets are suspected of having caused small
cracks in the skin of the plane that could grow and eventually join
into one large crack, the FAA said.
   The FAA reported on Tuesday that a special inspection of 96
older Boeing 737s had revealed small cracks in one of every nine
aircraft but not of a magnitude to cause alarm. The inspection is
ongoing.
   Farrar said the new rules were ``aimed at stopping the cause of
the cracks in the first place.''
   ``We're fairly certain that most of the cracks that we're
concerned with came from the fact that there were countersunk
rivets,'' he said.
   The proposed rules are subject to public comment until July 24.

<HEAD>Guild Members Vote On Independent Contracts With 64 Companies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 64 production companies signed
independent contracts with the Writers Guild of America as union
members, claiming they had split management ranks, gathered to
decide whether to accept the agreements.
   Six more producer requests for contracts were turned in to union
officials by Thursday night, when approximately 1,500 guild writers
met at the Hollywood Paladium to cast their votes. East Coast
members of the guild cast ballots Thursday night in New York.
   The results of the voting were to be announced this afternoon,
union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said here.
   The 9,000-member guild claimed the contracts effectively split
management ranks among the makers of such hit productions as ``The
Cosby Show'' and ``The Tonight Show.''
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,
representing the industry's biggest producers, downplayed the
defections, which represent the first significant break in the
12-week strike that has forced delays in the start of the fall TV
season.
   ``We're anticipating ratification,'' Ms. Rhoden said before the
meeting. ``We see it strategically as a good move at this time to
break the logjam with the alliance.''
   Meanwhile, negotiators for both the alliance and the guild
agreed to meet in small groups Saturday and in aother full-dress
bargaining session Tuesday.
   Among the terms in the three-year independent contracts are a 35
percent formula for foreign residuals and greater creative input,
two of the major points of contention with the alliance since the
March 7 walkout.
   The alliance is offering 10.3 percent for foreign residuals,
said spokesman Herb Steinberg. Residuals are the fees paid to
writers when TV shows are rerun or movies reissued.
   The list of 64 production companies released at the meeting
includes the Carsey-Werner Company, which produces two of the most
popular shows on television, ``The Cosby Show'' and its spinoff,
``A Different World.''
   The makers of ``The Tonight Show'' signed a contract and the
producers of ``Late Night with David Letterman'' have agreed to a
contract but haven't signed, said union President George Kirgo.
Among the others to sign were producers of ``Alf,'' ``The Muppets''
and ``Highway to Heaven.''
   Steinberg said none of the 217 major producers that belong to
the alliance has signed independent contracts. Large producers,
whose ranks include Columbia Pictures, MTM and Lorimar, employ 80
percent of the industry's writers and supply 84 percent of
prime-time TV shows, he said.
   ``The alliance producers are holding strong,'' Steinberg said.
``Our objective is to get this town back to work and get everybody
working.''
   He estimated that the independent deals would only re-employ
about 72 writers.
   ``If they're satisfied to put 72 writers to work and leave 4,000
out of work, that's their choice,'' he said.
   ``They have no way to estimate that number,'' Ms. Rhoden
responded. ``They just pulled that out of thin air the way they do
with all of their other figures.''

<HEAD>Forget Allegis; United's Parent Returns To Old Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of United Airlines has laid to rest
the ill-fated Allegis episode by dumping that corporate name and
reassuming its old identity, UAL Corp.
   UAL Corp. was UAL Inc. until Feb. 1987, when the company became
Allegis Corp. as part of then-chairman Richard J. Ferris' plan to
turn the airline company into a one-stop travel conglomerate.
   But stockholders didn't buy the concept and a threatened proxy
fight by the firm's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, forced
Ferris' ouster four months later.
   The company has sold its Westin and Hilton hotel chains, its
Hertz car-rental business and a 50 percent stake in its Apollo
computerized reservations system.
   The shake-up left the Chicago company holding only United
Airlines, half of Apollo and the Allegis name, which shareholders
voted overwhelmingly to change Thursday at the annual meeting.
   ``Our objective in returning to our core business of running an
airline is to grow United Airlines into this nation's pre-eminent
airline,'' UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said Thursday in announcing
plans to purchase up to 60 new Boeing jetliners.
   The name change was to be filed today with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the company's new stock-exchange ticker
symbol, UAL, becomes effective Tuesday, said spokesman Matt Gonring.

<HEAD>Researchers Use Tiny Video Camera in Own `Roots' Production</HEAD>

   Agricultural researchers are doing their own
production of ``Roots'' by inserting a tiny video camera into the
soil to record the underground development of soybean plants.
   The technique could help scientists understand how various
tillage systems affect crop growth, as well as when and where to
apply fertilizer and pesticide.
   ``I think it will work and it will be an important tool,'' said
Mary Ann Levan, a University of Illinois researcher who worked on
the project with U.S. Department of Agriculture engineers John
Hummel and Ken Sudduth.
   The 1- by 3-inch video camera is guided down clear plastic tubes
inserted in the bean rows and used to record root growth from a few
inches to more than 3 feet below the surface.
   ``It's not very spectacular as movies go, I'm afraid,'' said
Hummel, scanning one tape.
   Depth markers can be read on the inside of the tube, and white
soybean roots can be seen in the earth. Occasionally, an insect
moves into the frame to nibble on a root.
   ``I saw a soybean beetle,'' said Levan. ``The root was very
prominent _ new, large and white _ and there was the worm chewing
through it. It was real clear.''
   The tubes are inserted in the ground at an angle soon after
planting so the soybean crop can be checked throughout the season.
In two previous seasons, the focus has been on perfecting the
technique.
   Without the video equipment, scientists must remove cores of
soil, section them, wash off the dirt and measure roots, Levan
said. That method does not allow observation of the same roots
throughout the season, she said.
   Hummel said the tiny camera actually was designed to inspect the
inside of pipes in nuclear power plants.
   In the UI study, some soybeans being monitored are planted in
undisturbed soil while others are planted after deep, thorough
plowing.
   ``It also should be helpful for fertilizer placement because it
tells you where the active roots are during the growing season,''
said Levan. ``Also, you can observe insects that attack roots and
see when they hatch and where they feed.''
   That might help scientists determine the best time and location
for insecticides, and it should help them compare the results of
various products by watching them work in the soil, the researchers
said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar held steady in thin European
trading early today. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said market activity was dampened by the absence of many
senior foreign exchange dealers attending a convention in Hawaii.
As well, an approaching long weekend in the major U.S. and British
markets undermined dealers' willingness to take new positions.
   ``It's going to be a day of low business volume and few people
to talk to,'' said a trader with a West German bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where trading stops before the start of the European
business day, the U.S. currency closed at 124.64 Japanese yen, up
from 124.50 yen late Thursday. In London trading later today, the
dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen.
   Midmorning dollar rates, compared with late Thursday, included:
1.7090 West German marks, up from 1.7080; 1.4260 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4257; 5.7620 French francs, unchanged; 1.9125 Dutch
guilders, unchanged; 1,268.50 Italian lire, up from 1,268.00, and
1.2380 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2374
   The dollar rose against the British pound, which was quoted at
$1.8592, compared with $1.8625 on Thursday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$452.50 a troy ounce, down from $453.30 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $452.70, down from $454.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, closed at a bid of $454.12, up from
$452.42.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid of $6.58 a troy
ounce, down from $6.63.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened
sharply to 1.125 billion pounds, or $2.09 billion, in April from a
revised 885 million pounds, or $1.65 billion, in the previous
month, the government said Friday.
   The current account deficit widened to 525 million pounds, or
$977 million, from a revised 285 million pounds, or $530 million,
in March, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The current account includes ``invisible trade'' such as
financial transactions.
   The figures were slightly worse than the markets had expected.
Expectations called for a trade deficit of about 1 billion pounds
and a current account deficit of 400 million pounds.
   However, the news had little effect on the stock and foreign
exchange markets.

<HEAD>Stern's To Close Seven Stores In Philly Area, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a two-year effort to crack the
Philadelphia market, Stern's is preparing to throw in the towel and
sell its seven department stores in the city and suburbs, a
published report said today.
   Retailing sources quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer said
Stern's parent, Toronto-based Campeau Corp., has found a buyer for
the stores and should announce a sale within several weeks. The
buyer was not identified.
   Stern's, a 27-store chain based in Paramus, N.J., moved into the
Philadelphia market in July 1986 by taking over the Gimbels stores
in the area.
   But Stern's has not been able to improve the performance of the
seven former Gimbels, which had sales of $134.2 million in 1985,
according to unidentified trade sources quoted by the newspaper.
   The buyer is expected to be a retailer that caters to a lower-or
moderate-income clientele, possibly a discount chain, the Inquirer
reported.
   Joele Frank, a spokeswoman for Campeau, had no comment on the
report.

<TEXT>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP)_ An appeals court has paved the way for an
annual meeting of the struggling Allegheny International Inc., the
subject of a heated proxy fight.
   The ruling Thursday by a panel of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld a federal District Court ruling and overturned a May
16 ruling by a bankruptcy court, which prohibited the meeting for
90 days.
   Last week, a federal appeals judge temporarily halted the
meeting, originally scheduled for last Friday, until the court
could hear the case.
   Circuit Court Judge Edward Becker did not set a date for the
meeting. But he said, ``It is not suggested that the court lacks
the power to fix the date.''
   The New York investment firm Speer Leeds & Kellog is leading a
proxy fight to gain control of the Pittsburgh company, which
manufactures Oster and Sunbeam appliances, among other consumer
products.
   The dissident shareholders have nominated candidates for seven
of the 13 seats on the board of directors.
   The company is reorganizing under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
laws, and unsecured creditors, who claim that a change in
management would delay the company's emergence from bankruptcy
proceedings, have been trying to cancel the proxy vote.
   Company management also opposes the dissidents, claiming they
have no experience in the company's business and no definite plans
for the future.

<TEXT>
   A government advisory committee Friday unveiled a
series of measures to bring down soaring land prices, including
promoting the relocation of government offices outside of Tokyo and
more underground and high-rise construction.
   A government report in April said land prices skyrocketed last
year, with the most expensive real estate in central Tokyo valued
at 34 million yen, or $272,000, per square meter, or more than $6.7
billion an acre.
   The medium- and long-term recommendations also include tax
reform to encourage development of farmland within cities for
housing and the use of taxes on idle land to promote construction
of leisure facilities, said Tadashi Miyagawa of the Management and
Coordination Agency.
   The panel is expected to present its plan to the new
administrative reform committee on May 30 for further study. A
final report will be presented to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
in mid-June, Miyagawa said. The government is expected to decide
soon after which measures it will take to bring down inflated land
prices, he said.
   Politicians and consumer groups have called the land price
problem the most urgent in Japanese society. Most young people have
given up hopes of owning their own home.

   South Korea's current account surplus
rose 41 percent in the first four months of this year from its
level of a year earlier, the Bank of Korea reported Friday.
   The surplus in January through April was $3.89 billion, up from
2.76 billion dollars one year ago.
   Officials at the central bank said if the present pace
continues, the surplus is likely to top $10 billion by the end of
the year, above the record of $9.85 billion dollars last year.
   The current account, measuring trade in merchandise and
services, showed a surplus of $880 million in April, down from
$1.25 billion in March but up from $650 million in April last year.
   The officials said the decline from March was due largely to a
slowdown in exports attributed to labor strikes and other factors
which affected shipments, particularly of automobiles and toys.

   A Japan Air Lines subsidiary has agreed to pay
about $20 million to acquire a 20 percent stake in HAL Inc., the
parent of Hawaiian Airlines, the largest air carrier in Hawaii.
   Pan Pacific Hoteliers Inc. has agreed to purchase newly issued
stock, which will represent up to 20 percent of HAL's outstanding
shares, for $40 per share, HAL Chairman John H. Magoon Jr. said in
a statement issued Thursday.
   The stock purchase is subject to government review. Federal law
limits foreign ownership in U.S. airlines to a maximum of 25
percent.
   PPH does not intended to seek control or to take an active role
in Hawaiian's management, HAL said, but the Japanese group will
gain one seat on HAL's board.
   Pan Pacific Hoteliers is a Hawaii corporation that holds
investments in Hawaii real estate, including hotels and
recreational facilities.
   Hawaiian Airlines operates throughout Hawaii, as well as to the
West Coast, the South Pacific and Guam.
   ``We anticipate that this investment by PPH will strengthen our
growth potential in the Pacific,'' Magoon said. ``It will also
enhance our relationship with Hawaii's fastest growing segment of
the marketplace.''
   The airline posted operating revenues of about $300 million in
1987, making it the 14th largest in the United States.

   Major European airlines expect their
profits will fall by about 16 percent this year after a dramatic 93
percent jump in earnings in 1987, the Association of European
Airlines said Friday.
   The AEA, which represents 22 major European carriers, predicted
the combined net profit of its members would fall to about $650
million in 1988 from $775 million last year.
   The airlines' 1987 net profit was up 93 percent over the $400
million reported in 1986, the AEA said in a statement.
   Gross operating profit for the group was expected to fall to
about $1.1 billion this year from a record $1.29 billion in 1987.
   The AEA's forecasts indicate airline profits would return to
1985 levels.
   The AEA said growth in passenger traffic is expected to slow to
about 7 percent this year, from 13 percent in 1987 when traffic
rebounded from a disastrous previous year.
   Traffic growth in 1987 was particularly strong on North Atlantic
routes, which recorded a 19 percent increase. However, the AEA said
traffic on the route would rise only 6 percent this year because of
the weak dollar.
   Seventeen out of the 22 AEA members fly the North Atlantic.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who persuaded a Long
Island utility to abandon a $5.3 billion nuclear plant, still has
to sell the deal to Wall Street bankers and a host of federal,
state and local officials.
   Cuomo, who announced the tentative agreement on the Shoreham
nuclear plant Thursday, also wants the plant 55 miles east of
Manhattan dismantled, but said there may be problems winning
approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``I expect the NRC to do everything it can to kill us and open
the plant,'' the governor said. ``I don't trust the NRC.''
   ``We're not going to comment on that,'' NRC spokesman Frank
Ingram said today.
   If the agreement with the Long Island Lighting Co. goes through,
it would mark the first time a completed U.S. nuclear plant was
abandoned before opening. For LILCO, which was driven to the edge
of bankruptcy by the plant, the deal averted a threatened takeover
by the state.
   The accord drew applause from Shoreham opponents, even though it
concedes LILCO a rate hike of more than 50 percent over the next
decade to pay for the shutdown.
   ``This makes my whole year!'' said Linda Schantz, who lives in
the town of Shoreham with her husband and two children.
   But it was the latest bad news for the troubled nuclear
industry. More than 100 nuclear plants have been canceled since
LILCO began building Shoreham in 1973 and no plants have been
proposed in the last decade.
   The pact ``is a bad agreement for the nation as a whole,'' said
Edward M. Davis, president of the American Nuclear Energy Council,
an industry group in Washington. ``The agreement could threaten
energy security, as well as national security, by increasing oil
prices in the face of predicted brownouts in the Northeast this
summer.''
   Cuomo said the plant must be torn down to prevent future state
leadersfrom resurrecting it.
   Just mothballing it, he told an Albany news conference, ``would
be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing it in the
closet.''
   U.S. Rep. George Hochbrueckner, whose district includes the
plant, agreed.
   ``We've shown Shoreham the cross, but we have to put a stake
through its heart,'' he said.
   However, if the plant were dismantled, the fuel rods would have
to be disposed at a nuclear waste facility. There are no facilities
for high-level, commercial nuclear waste in the United States, NRC
spokesman Frank Ingram said earlier this month.
   The Shoreham project, begun in 1965, ended up 10 years behind
schedule and 80 times more expensive than predicted.
   The plant was completed in 1984 but never opened because state
and local officials refused to participate in preparing emergency
evacuation plans, arguing that Long Island couldn't be safely
evacuated in a nuclear accident. Lacking such a plan, the NRC
refused to issue more than a low-power testing license.
   Under the agreement, LILCO would pay to decommission the plant,
which Cuomo aides said could cost $500 million, while the state
would buy it for a token dollar so that LILCO can claim a tax loss.
   Cuomo said some details of the agreement remain to be worked
out, but insisted ``we have gotten everything we wanted. ...
Shoreham has to die, Shoreham will die.''
   To make that happen, the investment community must agree to
refinance $2 billion worth of LILCO debt at lower interest rates.
Wall Street's initial reaction was positive. The price of LILCO
stock jumped nearly 14 percent Thursday, rising $1.375 to $11.38 in
heavy trading.
   The state Public Service Commission must also agree to grant
LILCO 5 percent rate hikes for the next three years, and set a goal
of 5 percent increases a year for the following seven years.
   LILCO's nearly 1 million customers already pay the second
highest power rates in the country, second only to neighboring
Consolidated Edison in the New York City area.
   In addition, the state Legislature must give the New York Power
Authority permission to build five non-nuclear generating plants on
Long Island to ensure sufficient power for the area.

<TEXT>
   After-tax incomes fell 0.9 percent in April,
the sharpest setback in a year, as tax filings took a big bite out
of Americans' disposable income, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said it was the first decline in
disposable income since a 0.6 percent drop last November and the
biggest decrease since a 2.5 percent decline in April 1987, when
changes prompted by the new tax law took an even bigger bite out of
Americans' incomes.
   Facing big tax bills, Americans cut back on spending last month
as well. Personal consumption spending was basically flat in April
following a 0.8 percent rise in March.
   Before adjusting for taxes, personal income rose a weak 0.1
percent in April following a 1.1 percent jump in March. This
performance was substantially below economists' expectations.
   Many of them had been looking for a gain of around 0.6 percent
based on the strong employment increase in April which pushed the
jobless rate down to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent.
   The big decline in disposable incomes pushed Americans' savings
rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, down to 3.8
percent last month, compared to a rate of 4.7 percent in March.
   The report said personal tax payments climbed at an annual rate
of $36.2 billion in April, compared to a March increase of $10.9
billion. Most of that gain came in payments taxpayers had to make
when they filed their returns before the April 15 deadline.
   Wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of $7.9 billion in
April, down from a March increase of $15 billion, reflecting
primarily the fact that wages were boosted in March by a payment of
bonuses to workers at Ford Motor Co.
   Farm income fell $7.6 billion last month compared to an increase
of $19.4 billion in March, with federal subsidy payments accounting
for the wide swing.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods fell by $4.3
billion while purchases of non-durable goods dropped $14.1 billion.
Purchases of services, which include housing costs, climbed $11.6
billion.

<HEAD>Guilty Plea in Computer Conspiracy Case
^Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer whiz has pleaded guilty to
conspiring to sell $4 million in stolen supercomputer technology to
the Soviet Union.
   Kevin Anderson of Fremont admitted in federal court on Thursday
he took part in a scheme with three other people to sell the
Soviets plans to a system that allows computers to process as many
as 1 billion instructions per second.
   The technology had a restricted rather than classified status
but could have proved damaging to U.S. security if the Soviets had
received it, according to the government.
   The deal was broken up by government agents who infiltrated the
scheme, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said when arrests were
made last year.
   Anderson pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate export laws and
wire fraud, based on his use of the telephone to defraud Saxpy
Computer Corp. of Sunnyvale, from which the plans were stolen.
   In exchange, prosecutors dropped about a dozen other charges
against the former software engineer at Synthesized Computer
Systems Inc. in Santa Clara.
   Anderson faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to
$20.3 million at sentencing July 15.
   The plea came two weeks before an extradition hearing in Canada
for Charles McVey, an alleged conspirator in the scheme. He is
being held in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Ivan-Pierre Batinic, an engineer who once worked fr Saxpy, and
his brother Stevan also were charged in the case.
   According to court documents, Anderson had planned to use an
elaborate money-laundering scheme involving Liechtenstein banks to
set up a computer business in Dublin, Ireland, after completing the
sale to the Soviets.

<HEAD>April After-Tax Income Down, Consumption Spending Stagnant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with five grafs to UPDATE with income and spending
report today. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, The growth ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tax filings took a big chunk from Americans' disposable income
last month and compelled them to cut spending substantially, the
Commerce Department reported today.
   It said after-tax incomes fell 0.9 percent in April, the
sharpest setback in a year and the first decline since a 0.6
percent drop in November. Personal consumption spending was
basically stagnant in April following a 0.8 percent rise in March,
the department said.
   In April 1987, changes prompted by the new tax law took a bigger
bite out of Americans' incomes and reduced their disposable income
by 2.5 percent.
   Before adjusting for taxes, personal income rose a weak 0.1
percent in April following a 1.1 percent jump in March. This
performance was substantially below the expectations of many
economists, who have predicted strong economic growth this year.
   Evidence of that strong growth was reported Thursday by the
Commerce Department, which said the gross national product grew at
a surprisingly rapid annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first three
months of the year.
   The growth was much better than anticipated and came largely
from surging exports, higher auto sales and increased business
capital investment.
   ``You would have to say that not only was the stock market crash
ignored, but the economy thumbed its nose at it,'' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   The report reflected a sharp upward revision from an initial
estimate made a month ago that the GNP grew at a more modest 2.3
percent rate in the first quarter.
   It elated Republicans, who are hoping a record 66-month-long
expansion since the last recession of 1981-82 will bolster
prospects that Vice President George Bush will win the White House
in the November election.
   But to the stock and bond markets, sensitive barometers of the
economy's future direction, the GNP report was widely viewed as
another signal that higher inflation is inevitable.
   The inflation signal was substantiated by another government
report Thursday showing after-tax corporate profits rose only 0.5
percent in the first quarter. Some economists suggested that meant
companies will attempt to boost their profits by raising prices.
   On Wall Street, stocks gained only marginally Thursday in light
trading, reflecting an apathy that has persisted for months. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.38 points to 1,966.75
after falling 1.16 the day before.
   Bond prices were mostly lower. The key 30-year Treasury bond
fell \ point or $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value, and its
yield, which moves inversely to its price, climbed to 9.32 percent
from 9.28 percent late Wednesday.
   Many analysts have predicted that the Federal Reserve,
responsible for restraining inflation, will push interest rates
higher to dampen demand for credit. The central bank has tightened
credit twice in the past two months.
   Some said the fast GNP growth was an advance signal of a 1989
recession, despite White House assertions that the number harbored
no bad news.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade today on buying encouraged by forecasts for
hot, dry weather in the Midwest through the Memorial Day weekend.
   The volatile soybean market, which fell Wednesday and Thursday,
surged at today's opening, with most contracts up more than 12
cents a bushel.
   Wheat also posted strong early gains while corn and oats were
slightly higher.
   Although dry weather poses a real threat to the maturing winter
wheat crop, the runup in soybean, corn and oat prices is largely
speculative since those newly planted crops have not yet developed
enough to sustain damage, analysts said.
   ``I don't think the crops are under stress but the traders are
sure hot,'' said Steve Freed, an analyst in Chicago with the
investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Recent trading patterns indicate soybean prices will continue to
advance if the weather stays dry, Freed said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3{ cents to 5\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.40\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.15 a bushel; oats were 2} cents
to 3{ cents higher with July at $1.74 a bushel; soybeans were 8
cents to 13} cents higher with July at $7.66{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at
72.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with August at 76.55 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.33 cent higher with June at 53.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent to .75 cent higher with July at 54.15 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>EEC Criticizes U.S. Cuts In Wheat Set-Aside Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission criticized the United States Friday for cuts in required
wheat set-aside acreage, which will take less land out of
production this year than last.
   ``There seems to be a fairly flagrant contradiction between what
the U.S. claims to do and what it is doing,'' said a Commission
official, who asked not to be named.
   Both the EEC and the United States are using programs to take
land out of production as a way to cut agricultural overproduction.
   The United States had adjusted its support levels for wheat
farmers by announcing earlier this week that they would have to cut
planted acreage by only 10 percent this year in order to qualify
for government subsidies.
   Last year they had been forced to cut acreage by 27.5 percent.
   Each year at this time the U.S. administration announces price
supports and acreage requirements for subsidies under various
programs.
   The EEC spokesman said it remained determined to continue with
its own set-aside programs, calling it unfortunate that Washington
was taking this action so soon before the mid-term review of the
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks
to be held at the end of this year.
   The U.S. administration has called for an end to all
agricultural subsidies in both the United States and the 12-nation
EEC by the year 2000. The trade bloc has criticized the goal as
unrealistic.

<TEXT>
   Arnold Van wants customers to
remember his check cashing service as the one that's so good it
offers the shirt off his back.
   Well, actually not his back, but the backs of some of his women
clerks.
   Van is a pioneer of topless check cashing, following in the
tradition of Broward County's famous topless doughnut shop.
   ``With all the competition we needed something unique,'' said
Van, director of operations for Tops Check Cashing. ``What could be
more unique than having topless girls?''
   For the regular check-cashing fee of up to 10 percent of the
check's value, customers can talk to two topless hostesses while
waiting for their cash. The women also sell beer, cigarettes, soft
drinks and snacks.
   The check-cashing office, which began the topless service
Monday, doesn't plan to put up a sign announcing it at the shopping
center where the office is located, but Van said he plans to
advertise.
   ``I think it's disgusting,'' said Eleanor Kasch, manager of a
sandwich shop nearby. ``You have many young children in the
neighborhood.''
   Topless businesses are allowed in unincorporated areas of the
county as long as they do not admit minors, said sheriff's
spokesman George Crolius.
   In 1985, a topless doughnut shop, R Donuts, opened in Fort
Lauderdale, becoming the first topless business in the county that
wasn't a bar or nightclub.
   ``We're still selling a lot of doughnuts,'' its owner, Andy
Emery, said today.

   British industrialist Brian Beazer and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. faced a new barrier against their
$1.7-billion hostile bid for Koppers Co. when a federal judge in
Los Angeles on Friday summoned them to a contempt of court hearing
June 6.
   Koppers filed papers Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles accusing Beazer and Shearson of violating the court's order
not to proceed with their $60-per-share tender offer.
   Echoing allegations lodged previously in federal court here,
Koppers complained that its suitors have continued to advertise for
shareholder support and extend their tender offer's expiration date.
   Koppers spokeswoman Maggie Cessar said U.S. District Chief Judge
Manuel Real filed the order Friday in Los Angeles.
   The Pittsburgh-based construction materials and chemicals
company previously won federal injunctions in Pittsburgh and Los
Angeles blocking the tender offer on considerations of securities
laws and anti-trust laws respectively.
   U.S. District Chief Judge Maurice Cohill previously scheduled a
June 6 hearing in Pittsburgh to consider alleged violations of
securities laws by BNS Inc., the group headed by Beazer and
Shearson.
   The latest extension of the offer was to expire at midnight
Friday.
   BNS said that as of Wednesday, 19.74 million common shares had
been tendered and not withdrawn and that counting shares it already
owns it could claim 77.6 percent of the shares outstanding.
   BNS also said nearly 107,600 preferred shares, or 71.7 percent
of those outstanding, have been tendered.

   McGraw-Hill Inc. said Friday it has sold its 49
percent interest in Nikkei-McGraw-Hill Inc., a joint venture
publishing company in Japan, for $283 million.
   The stake was bought by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major Japanese
publisher, which had owned 51 percent of the venture. The venture
publishes 16 magazines, six newsletters and other services in
Japanese.
   McGraw-Hill said it remained committed to doing business in
Japan. The company's Standard & Poor's unit recently established
operations in Tokyo.
   The sale gave McGraw-Hill a gain of $224 million before taxes
and $112 million after taxes, the company said. The gain will be
offset by write-downs in other assets and unusual charges amounting
to $149 million before taxes and $110 million after taxes.

   Texaco Inc.'s board today rejected a $60-a-share
buyout offer from takeover artist Carl C. Icahn and denounced the
bid as a pressure tactic.
   The directors also called on Icahn to abandon what they
described as his ``costly and disruptive'' proxy contest, in which
he is seeking five seats on the oil giant's board.
   Icahn launched the proxy battle this morning before the board
formally gathered to consider the offer, which values Texaco at
$14.6 billion. Spokesman Neil Call said Icahn did not want to waste
time and decided to mail ballots for his slate of candidates before
the long Memorial Day weekend began.
   In rejecting the offer, the Texaco board cited a number of
factors they claimed undermined the seriousness of the bid. They
echoed management's sentiments in questioning whether Icahn could
arrange financing and said the 48-hour deadline he imposed on the
offer indicated he was not serious.
   The board said it was confident Texaco's restructuring program
would enhance shareholder value.
   Analysts were skeptical that Texaco's board would approve
Icahn's offer.
   ``I would be flabbergasted if Texaco's board agreed to Icahn's
merger proposal,'' said Michael Young, who follows Texaco for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   He joined others in suggesting that the offer was doomed from
the beginning and that Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, was
fully aware of that.
   Wall Street remained unenthusiastic. Shares in the nation's
third largest oil company eased 50 cents to $49.50 a share in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Texaco and Icahn battled it out in competing full-page ads in
selected newspapers today _ with Texaco asking shareholders if they
can trust the company's future to Icahn, and the takeover
strategist urging them to take up his offer.
   Analysts suggested Icahn's real intention in making the bid was
to push Texaco's stock price up as he continued his war of nerves
against the management of the White Plains, N.Y.-based company.
   Icahn's offer of $60 for each of Texaco's 243 million shares
would value the company at $14.6 billion.
   However, under the offer, he would have to pay out only $12.4
billion for the 207 million shares he does not already own. He paid
an average $34 a share, or about $1.22 billion, for his existing
stake of 36 million shares.
   The combined total of $13.64 billion would amount to the biggest
sum ever paid in a corporate buyout. The previous record was a
$13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf Corp. by Standard Oil Co. of
California, now Chevron Corp., in 1984.
   Texaco President James W. Kinnear, in a statement released
Thursday, reiterated his claim that Icahn's offer was bogus.
   ``There is no basis to believe that Mr. Icahn can arrange the
financing for a transaction of approximately $20 billion _
including the purchase of the shares he doesn't own ... and the
payment of debt and other obligations that would have to be
satisified in connection with his proposal,'' Kinnear said.
   When making the offer on Wednesday, Icahn said he was so sure he
could obtain financing that he would place $100 million in escrow
and forfeit it to Texaco if he failed to get commitments before the
company's annual shareholders meeting next month _ subject to
certain conditions.
   The struggle has been escalating since last fall when Icahn
began building what has become a 14.8 percent stake in Texaco.
   Today, that stake is so large that he cannot sell it quickly _
and collect his profit _ without depressing its price on the market.
   ``I think he wants somebody to bail him out,'' said Cliff
Haigler, an analyst at the securities firm Howard, Weil, Labouisse,
Friedrichs Inc. in Houston.
   Icahn revealed Thursday that Texaco recently found a buyer
willing to pay $50 a share for his stake in the oil company, but he
rejected the offer because it ``smacked of greenmail.''
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri said the claim ``is totally untrue
and Mr. Icahn knows it.'' Furthermore, Maneri said that if a
$50-a-share offer had surfaced, ``every indication we have is that
Icahn would have run through a brick wall to accept it.''
   In recent months, Icahn has been pressuring Texaco's management
to take steps to raise the value of the company's stock, if
necessary by breaking it up and selling off the pieces.
   He has backed up the demand by launching a proxy fight to
install himself and four allies on Texaco's 14-seat board.
   Texaco, which emerged last month from a year under bankruptcy
court protection, responded by restoring its $3 annual dividend and
expanding its planned asset sales to $5 billion from $3 billion.
   Wednesday afternoon, company officials broke off three weeks of
peace talks, claiming Icahn was making unreasonable demands for
special treatment in the financial restructuring. An Icahn
spokesman strongly denied the charge.
   A few hours later, Icahn released a letter to Texaco containing
his offer. He also said he would drop his threatened proxy contest
if management would allow the other 211,000 stockholders to
consider the offer at the company's annual meeting next month.

   Prices on London's Stock Exchange settled slightly
lower Friday as the market largely ignored worse-than-expected
British trade figures and chose instead to focus on the long
holiday weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 1.6
points, or 0.09 percent, lower at 1,783.7.
   Volume totaled a slim 346.5 million shares, compared with
Thursday's 435.8 million. Analysts said volume was low on account
of the British bank holiday on Monday.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to 1.125 billion
pounds, or $2.09 billion, in April, and its current account deficit
widened to 525 million pounds, the government said. Average market
forecasts were for a April trade deficit of around 1 billion pounds
and a current account deficit of 400 million pounds.
   The current account includes ``invisible trade'' including
financial transactions.
   But several analysts said the trade information was not critical
to the equity market.
   ``There was a little bit of a quiver after the trade figures but
then the market took it completely in stride,'' said one analyst.
   Dealers said the only feature in an otherwise quiet, pre-holiday
market were food issues, buoyed by the competing bids for Rowntree
PLC from the two Swiss food giants Nestle SA and Jacobs Suchard AG.

   General Motors Corp. said Friday it is recalling
39,000 1987 model cars to find about 8,700 built with possibly
defective throttle cables.
   The recall includes 1987 Buick Electra, Oldsmobile Delta 88 and
Ninety-Eight, and Pontiac Bonneville models, GM said.
   If the throttle cable binds against its sheath, causing the
throttle to stick open, the engine may not return to complete idle
after acceleration.
   GM said its has received no reports of accidents or injuries
related to the defect.
   Dealers will inspect and replace the throttle cable free, GM
said.

   H.J. Heinz Co. said Friday it had agreed with
Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. to extend their merger agreement until
June 3 while they consider the Justice Department's opposition to
the deal.
   The government announced Thursday plans to block the proposed
merger of two of the nation's top three canned tuna brands. The
deal would give Heinz half of the nation's canned tuna sales, worth
about $1 billion per year.
   The regulators rejected arguments by Heinz that canned tuna is a
commodity whose price is determined by the world market and that
imports provide adequate competition through their 27 percent share
of domestic sales.
   Heinz already owns top-selling Star-Kist. Bumble Bee of San
Diego is third.
   The Justice Department said the merger could reduce competition
and allow Heinz to hike prices on one of America's most popular
foods.

<HEAD>Chicago Exchanges Oppose SEC's Bid to Regulate Stock-Index Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two exchanges that trade stock-index futures said
Friday they oppose the Securities and Exchange Commission's bid to
take over regulation of trading in the contracts.
   ``It's a grasp for power and it was certainly not a unanimous
opinion by the SEC board,'' said Andy Yemma, a spokesman for the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ``This is not a new agenda and it
predates the stock market crash.''
   In Washington Thursday, the SEC voted 3-2 in favor of taking
over the regulation of stock index futures from its sister agency,
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The shift in jurisdiction must be approved by Congress.
   SEC Chairman David Ruder said studies since the Oct. 19 stock
market collapse point to a need for one agency to oversee the
trading of stocks and stock-related products.
   In Chicago, where most stock-index futures are traded, officials
at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, which also offers
stock-index futures contracts, quickly denounced the move and vowed
to fight it. Stock-index futures also are traded by the Kansas City
Board of Trade and the New York Futures Exchange, a subsidiary of
the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``We would strongly disagree with that,'' said Mike O'Connell, a
spokesman for the Chicago Board of Trade, of the SEC vote.
   ``We feel that these markets should be regulated as they are by
the CFTC, who during the week of Oct. 19 performed flawlessly in
their duties,'' he said.
   O'Connell and Yemma contended that all trading in futures
contracts _ whether they be a financial product like stock-indexes
or an agricultural product like soybeans _ should be regulated by
the CFTC.
   ``Even though the underlying product emanates from the stock
exchange, these are still futures contracts and we believe, just as
Congress mandated, they should be regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission,'' O'Connell said.
   Yemma, who said the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500 Index makes up
75 percent of the market in stock-index futures trading, echoed
those sentiments.
   ``The CFTC is best equipped to regulate futures markets,'' he
said. ``Stock index futures are one product in a vast array of
financial and agricultural futures which we offer and the other
exchanges offer.''
   ``If you take stock index futures and move them to the SEC where
they would become simply one of many things the SEC oversees, we
don't feel there's the expertise there to oversee them correctly,''
Yemma said.
   He also said recent reports examining the causes of the stock
crash have criticized the SEC's regulatory work, but have not
faulted the futures commission's job.
   ``There have been efforts by certain members of Congress and
certain members of the SEC to move regulation of stock index
futures to the SEC for years,'' Yemma said. ``It's basically
politics and turf.''

   Desert Partners LP, waging a hostile $2.2 billion
takeover bid for USG Corp., lost a proxy battle for six seats on
the company's board, USG said Friday in announcing official results
of the vote.
   But the Midland, Texas-based investors group said it was
pressing ahead with its takeover attempt and had extended its
$42-a-share tender offer for 39 million shares until next Friday,
June 3, at 7 p.m. EDT.
   USG released the official results of the contest for six seats
on its board, showing the USG-backed slate. The results were
announced to stockholders Friday at a continuation of USG's annual
meeting, which was originally convened May 11.
   USG said its nominees for the board received 56 percent of the
vote, while Desert Partner's opposition slate of candidates won 41
percent.
   Three percent of the vote was withheld, according to the tally
completed by Corporation Trust Co.
   When USG announced the preliminary results Sunday, showing its
directors had won, officials for Desert Partners vowed to continue
their takeover fight.
   Fred Spar, a spokesman for the partnership, reiterated those
plans Friday.
   Besides extending its tender offer, he said Desert Partners
still was proposing to acquire USG through negotiations in a plan
that calls for giving stockholders a combination of cash,
debentures and stocks that have been valued at $50 a share.
   USG primarily manufactures building materials for the
construction industry.
   Among those elected to the USG board were three of the holding
company's executive vice presidents: Eugene B. Connolly, who also
is president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary USG
Interiors Inc.; A.J. Falvo Jr., president and chief executive of
another subsidiary, United States Gypsum Co.; and William J. White,
president and chief executive of the subsidiary, Masonite Corp.
   The three outside directors elected were James C. Cotting,
chairman, president and chief executive officer of Navistar
International Corp.; Philip C. Jackson, vice chairman of Central
Bank of the South; and John B. Schwemm, chairman and chief
executive of R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George P. Kroh, former chairman of a
Kansas City-based land development and real estate company, was
sentenced to three years in federal prison Friday for fraud.
   Kroh, 50, former head of Kroh Brothers Development Co., also was
ordered to pay $750,000 in restitution to two banks in the Kansas
City area.
   Kroh pleaded guilty April 13 under an agreement with prosecutors
to three felony counts. He appeared Friday before U.S. District
Judge Scott O. Wright, who sentenced Kroh to two concurrent
three-year prison terms on fraud counts.
   The judge also ordered Kroh to serve five years' probation on a
third count, conspiracy, when the prison term ends.
   Federal authorities said Kroh will be eligible for parole after
serving one year of the sentence unless it is later reduced by
Wright.
   The judge ordered Kroh to pae Kansas City
Ny $250,000 to thational Bank and Trust Co. of Prairie Village and $500,000
to the
Norbank of North Kansas City to make restitution for loans that he
obtained by making false financial statements.
   Kroh and his brother, John A. Kroh Jr., president of Kroh
Brothers Development, owned the prominent 77-year-old company that
developed shopping centers, residential areas and office buildings
across the country. The company entered bankruptcy proceedings in
early 1987 with assets of about nal checkoff program is administered by
a 113-member
Beef Promotion and Research Board, which represents producers and
importers. The department's Agricultural Marketing Service oversees
operations of the program.
   Gilles said that approval of the program means that producers
and importers no longer will get refunds of assessments on cattle
sold after Friday's announcement.
   However, Gilles said, those who paid assessments on cattle sold
between Oct. 1, 1986, and May 27, 1988, are eligible for a one-time
refund if they request it within 60 days of the sale date. The
board expects to issue those refunds in late August, he said.
   Here are the state-by-state votes as reported by USDA. The first
column of figures represents votes for the program; the second
column represents votes against the program.

<HEAD>Martinez Asks Government to Delay Drilling Off Keys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez asked the federal
government Friday to delay oil and gas drilling off Florida's
southwest coast and the Florida Keys.
   Martinez wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
asking for more time to study potential environmental damage from
any oil spills before any exploratory drilling is allowed.
   The governor also said he would reject requests for permits to
drill in areas leased by the Interior Department in 1984 and 1985
if such activities threaten the Keys or South Florida.
   ``It is critical that we have a detailed understanding of the
currents in the eastern Gulf (of Mexico) and Straits of Florida to
ensure the protection of the Florida Keys, home of the nation's
only living coral reef and countless other irreplaceable
resources,'' Martinez wrote.
   The only permit request the governor has received so far is from
Union Oil Co. of California, which wants to drill as many as 23
test wells north of the Dry Tortugas, which are west of Key West.
   The Republican governor also wrote a separate letter to
Florida's congressional delegation, vowing to continue discussing
the state's opposition to offshore drilling with officials in the
Reagan administration. He assured them he would take whatever
actions are necessary to protect the Keys and other sensitive
coastal areas.
   The letters dealt with an area south of Naples to just north of
the Dry Tortugas, Marquesas Islands and the Florida Keys, which was
not included in a recent agreement by Hodel to drop leasing plans
for 11 million acres off Florida's coasts.
   It is an area of 73 lease blocks for which Congress ordered a
three-year study before any drilling could be conducted.
   A panel of 30 scientists assembled by Martinez concluded that
the federal environmental research was inadequate and more would be
needed before potential detrimental impacts of such drilling on
Florida's environment and economy could be fully determined.
   Congress did not require any evaluation of the research results
before drilling could be permitted.
   Eighteen of the 19 members of Florida's congressional delegation
have signed a letter to the House Appropriations Committee urging
that a rider be attached to the Interior Department's appropriation
to prohbit the expenditure of any money for leasing or drilling off
Florida's southwest coast, Ms. Whitfield said. Rep. Sam Gibbons,
D-Tampa, declined to sign.
   The governor is concerned about what path an oil spill might
take near the Florida Keys and the impact it might have on the
coral reef, mangroves and other natural resources.
   His panel of scientists reported that existing studies lack
information on where prevailing currents might carry an oil spill
in the eastern Gulf and Straits of Florida.
   Martinez also cited the failure of the federal studies to
address all potential environmental and economic effects on
nearshore and coastal resources.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Declines To Block Swedish Takeover Of Murray Ohio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL RAWLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
refused Friday to block a $197 million takeover bid for Murray Ohio
Manufacturing Co. by AB Electrolux of Sweden.
   A three-judge panel said Electrolux should not be penalized, as
Murray asked, because it had been represented by a New York law
firm that once helped advise Murray on how to fight a takeover.
   The judges agreed that the law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, had a
conflict of interest, but they noted earlier testimony that no
confidential information from Murray was passed on to Electrolux.
   Electrolux officials learned of the potential conflict of
interest April 28 and switched to another adviser, Smith, Barney &
Harris Upham Co. Inc., the following day.
   The appeals judges upheld a decision Monday by U.S. District
Thomas A. Wiseman, who said he knew of ``no law permitting the
court to enjoin the transfer of stock.''
   Immediately after Wiseman ruled, Electrolux increased its tender
offer from $48 per share, or $182 million, to $52 per share, or
$197 million.
   Murray stock rose 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange Friday
to close at $60.75 per share, indicating Wall Street expects an
even higher offer.
   Murray officials have asked shareholders not to accept the
tender offer until they have reviewed it. Management promised a
recommendation by June 7, two weeks before the offer was scheduled
to expire.
   Two other lawsuits over the Electrolux bid are pending.
   One, in Chancery Court in Lawrenceburg, Tenn., challenges the
legality of Murray's plan to increase its outstanding stock by 50
percent _ a ``poison pill'' defense designed to make the cost of a
takeover prohibitive.
   Another lawsuit, in Ohio, was filed by Electrolux to challenge
Murray's arguments that an Ohio state law against hostile takeovers
does not apply to Murray. Murray Ohio was incorporated in Ohio in
1919 as an auto parts manufacturer but moved its headquarters to
suburban Brentwood in 1955.
   Murray Ohio manufactures lawn mowers and bicycles at
Lawrenceburg, Tenn.
   AB Electrolux, which has no connection with vacuum cleaner
manufacturer Electrolux Inc. of Marietta, Ga., operates a Tappan
range plant at Springfield, Tenn., north of Nashville.

<HEAD>Hair Product Firm to Convert to Private Ownership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Redken Laboratories, which manufactures
hypo-allergenic hair and skin products, will convert from public to
private ownership, chief executive officer Paula Kent Meehan
announced.
   Mrs. Meehan, 57, a former actress who founded the firm in as an
answer to her own allergy to hair spray, said Thursday she plans a
tender offer of $34 per share for the roughly 1.4 million shares
she does not already own.
   ``I found it very difficult being a public company,'' said Mrs.
Meehan, whose husband John is chairman and president of the company.
   ``What happens is there is a great deal of short-term thinking
that the analysts and financial community want you to do,'' she
said.``I think we did start to run our company based on quarters
rather than good planning.''
   The Meehans control about 48 percent of Redken stock. There are
2.74 million shares outstanding.
   Redken stock closed at $34 a share in over-the-counter trading
Friday.
   Mrs. Meehan said there is no possibility of a bidding war that
would increase the price of the offer, but she and her husband
refuse to sell their current stock to another party or engage in a
merger.
   Redken products are sold through beauty salons.
   She co-founded the company in 1960 with $3,000. Her partner at
that time, chemist Jheri Redding, sold his interest a short time
later.

Beazer seeking loan guarantee.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British industrialist Brian Beazer and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. faced a new barrier against their
$1.7-billion hostile bid for Koppers Co. when a federal judge in
Los Angeles on Friday summoned them to a contempt of court hearing
June 6.
   Koppers filed papers Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles accusing Beazer and Shearson of violating the court's order
not to proceed with their $60-per-share tender offer.
   Echoing allegations lodged previously in federal court here,
Koppers complained that its suitors have continued to advertise for
shareholder support and extend their tender offer's expiration date.
   Koppers spokeswoman Maggie Cessar said U.S. District Chief Judge
Manuel Real filed the order Friday in Los Angeles.
   The Pittsburgh-based construction materials and chemicals
company previously won federal injunctions in Pittsburgh and Los
Angeles blocking the tender offer on considerations of securities
laws and anti-trust laws respectively.
   U.S. District Chief Judge Maurice Cohill previously scheduled a
June 6 hearing in Pittsburgh to consider alleged violations of
securities laws by BNS Inc., the group headed by Beazer and
Shearson. Koppers has charged BNS with violating margin lending
laws by offering preferred stock to Shearson in return for a $540
million loan.
   In London Friday, Beazer's company, Beazer PLC, said it was
asking its shareholders to authorize a guarantee for the loan.
   Beazer said it would issue the loan guarantee only if in closing
the deal it did not have a merger agreement with Koppers or it had
less than 90 percent of Koppers' common and preferred shares.
   The latest extension of the BNS offer was to expire at midnight
Friday.
   BNS said that as of Wednesday, 19.74 million common shares had
been tendered and not withdrawn and that counting shares it already
owns it could claim 77.6 percent of the shares outstanding.
   BNS also said nearly 107,600 preferred shares, or 71.7 percent
of those outstanding, have been tendered.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Finish Week On A High Note</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices posted strong gains Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in anticipation of a dry Memorial Day weekend. Grain
futures advanced slightly.
   On other markets, gold and silver retreated; livestock and meat
futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index
futures declined.
   Soybeans also were supported by indications the Soviet Union had
purchased soybean meal from both Brazil and Argentina, analysts
said.
   But weather concerns dominated the soybean and grain markets as
they have throughout the unusually dry spring planting period. The
nation's soybean stockpiles are declining and fears of tight
supplies have pushed soybean futures prices to their highest levels
in four years.
   Soybean prices declined on Wednesday and Thursday when rain
entered the weekend weather forecasts. But Friday, most forecasters
were calling for only scattered showers across the northern Plains
and upper Midwest and dry conditions in the rest of the Corn Belt.
   ``The markets got hammered pretty good on Wednesday and
Thursday,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc. ``What we've pretty much done is moved to a level
midway between Thursday's lows and Tuesday's highs.''
   Soybean prices probably will open sharply higher Tuesday if the
long weekend is as hot and dry as expected, analysts said.
   The National Weather Service issued a six-to-10-day outlook
after the close, predicting below-normal rainfall for most of the
Midwest for the second half of next week.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 3\ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.39{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 7
cents higher with July at $2.16{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1}
cents higher with July at $1.72} a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to
16{ cents higher with July at $7.68 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures declined substantially on the Commodity
Exchange in New York in response to the dollar's gains against
other major currencies and on expectations the Federal Reserve was
set to raise its discount interest rate, analysts said.
   Activity was extremely light as many traders got an early start
on the weekend, said Bette Raptoploulos, an analyst in New York
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The metals declined despite the inflationary effect of higher
soybean prices, but Ms. Raptopoulos said it was not yet clear
whether fears of inflation have finally left the metals markets.
   ``I would say today, perhaps, the inflationary fears diffused,''
she said.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $3.30 lower with June at $450.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 8.4 cents to 8.5 cents lower with July at $6.575
a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as
cash prices fell amid slackening wholesale demand. Retailers have
reduced their beef purchases in anticipation of lower demand
following the Memorial Day weekend, analysts said.
   Some traders, eyeing the recent runup in cattle prices, sold on
fears of a repeat of the 1978 market, when cattle prices peaked on
May 30, then fell 15.2 percent by June 22, said Thomas Morgan,
president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``There's concern we might be in for that same kind of
pressure,'' he said.
   Pork futures advanced in reaction to a slight decrease in
slaughters, which many feel is a prelude to a seasonal rise in cash
hog prices, Morgan said.
   Live cattle were .23 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 71.92
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .63 cent lower with
August at 76.22 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .80 cent
higher with June at 53.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.30 cent to .92 cent higher with July at 54.32 cents a pound.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in light trading ahead of the holiday weekend.
   Crude-oil futures were pressured by reports that Iraq's oil
minister, visiting the United States, said his nation had no
intention of reducing oil production, according to Nauman Barakat,
vice-president of energy futures trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 11 cents
lower with July at $17.43 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to .41
cent lower with June at 47.78 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 52.55 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 2.10 points lower at 253.50.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
Friday as traders decided U.S. interest rates were likely to rise.
   Gold prices fell in thin trading. Republic National Bank said
gold bullion was bid at $451 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from $453.10 an ounce late Thursday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was first helped by
strong Japanese buying. It gained further when it went above 1.71
West German marks, a level which had been seen as the upper limit
of its present exchange rate.
   Although the Federal Reserve did not raise the discount rate
Friday, as some traders had expected, many continued to believe the
Fed has tightened credit enough so that U.S. banks will be prompted
to raise their prime rates another notch next week, said Jack
Adkins, a currency analyst for Refco Group in Chicago.
   Expectations of higher U.S. interest rates tend to boost the
dollar by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
   In London, the British pound traded late in the day at $1.8570,
down from $1.8625 late Thursday. Later in New York, sterling fell
to $1.8574 from $1.8611.
   The dollar closed at 124.64 Japanese yen in Tokyo, up from
124.50 late Thursday. In later London trading, the dollar was
quoted at 124.82 yen. At the end of the trading day in New York,
the dollar rose to 124.93 yen from 124.58 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7178 West German marks, up from 1.7086; 1.4358
Swiss francs, up from 1.4233; 1.2392 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2364; 5.7770 French francs, up from 5.7565; and 1,273.13 Italian
lire, up from 1,267.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7140 West German marks, up from 1.7080; 1.4305
Swiss francs, up from 1.4257; 5.7660 French francs, up from 5.7620;
1.9177 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9125; 1,270.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,268.00; and 1.2407 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2374.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $454.12 a troy ounce, up from
$452.42.
   The late bid price for gold bullion in London was $452 a troy
ounce, down from $453.30 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold was bid at
$452.50, down from $454.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $450.80 a troy ounce, down from $454.10 late
Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $6.59 a troy
ounce, down from $6.63. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $6.530 a troy ounce from $6.610 late
Thursday.

   Bonds recouped some of their early losses Friday
to end narrowly mixed.
   Analysts said trading activity was light, with many participants
getting an early jump on the long Memorial Day weekend.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue, which fell about \
point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, by midday, closed up 62.5
cents. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, slipped to
9.31 percent from Thursday's close of 9.32 percent.
   The bond market started out on a down note amid speculation the
Federal Reserve was tightening its credit policies again to prevent
the economy from overheating and inflation from rekindling.
   But fears of higher interest rates abated somewhat with an
easing of the closely watched federal funds rate, the interest on
overnight loans between banks. It traded at 7\ percent, down from
7} percent late Thursday.
   Fears of Fed tightening stemmed from Thursday's revised report
on first-quarter gross national product, which found the economy
grew at a brisk 3.9 percent annual rate.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities ranged from unchanged to up 1-32 point and long-term
issues were down [ point to up 1-16 point, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a business information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.03 to 108.32. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,133.97, down 0.34.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities were unchanged
in light trading, according to the investment firm Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.24 to 275.05.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 87 5-32 as of 3 p.m. EDT.
The average yield also was unchanged from late Thursday at 8.21
percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were down 1 basis point to
6.43 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 2 basis points to 6.83 percent and one-year
bills were off 7.12 percent.

   Nestle Foods Corp. announced Friday it was
voluntarily recalling all cans of Crosse & Blackwell split green
pea soup with ham.
   It asked that the product, which is distributed nationally, be
removed from all stores and warehouses and that individual
consumers return them to supermarkets for refund or replacement.
   Defects in some of the cans were detected by the company, which
then advised the federal Food and Drug Administration of the
recall, said Barbara Campbell, speaking for Nestle.
   She said the defect could cause cans to break and leak, which
would affect the product quality, but that no illness or injury has
been known to have occurred from the soup.
   The possibly defective cans are among 1,500 cases of the soup,
but as a precaution all cans of that type of soup were being
recalled, Nestle said.
   It said anyone with questions about the recall should call
800-553-5303.

<TEXT>
   Centel Corp. said Friday it was expanding its
cellular telephone business with the $763 million purchase of
United TeleSpectrum Inc., a cellular communications subsidiary of
United Telecommunications Inc.
   Centel, a Chicago-based communications firm with additional
interests in cable television, local exchange telephone service and
electric power, also will acquire $9.5 million of debt that United
TeleSpectrum owes to United Telecommunications, based in Kansas
City, Mo.
   Centel also announced plans to sell its Centel Business Systems
division, a move that may quiet a group of dissident shareholders
who have called for a breakup of the company.
   ``There are conversations ongoing at this point'' with a
prospective buyer for the business systems unit, said spokesman Tom
Ray, but he refused to identify that party.
   The aquisition of United TeleSpectrum will increase Centel's
presence in Southeastern cellular markets and give it a foothold in
the Northeast, including New York City and nearby areas of New
Jersey, Centel said in a statement.
   ``This acquisition takes us beyond our stated goal of doubling
our cellular holdings and clearly marks Centel Cellular as one of
the major players in the industry,'' said John P. Frazee, Centel's
chairman, president and chief executive officer since April 1.
   ``The acquisition firmly demonstrates our commitment to make
cellular communications a major thrust of Centel's future,'' Frazee
said.
   By combining its markets with those of United TeleSpectrum,
Centel Cellular will have operating control of 40 markets with a
total population of 14 million. That will rank Centel Cellular
among the country's top 10 cellular communications companies in
total population and second only to McCaw Communications Co. of
Kirkland, Wash., in total number of markets.
   In addition to its cellular and business systems operations,
Centel operates local exchange telephone services, cable television
services and electric utilities.

   The stock market drifted lower Friday in a
meandering preholiday session.
   A late downturn in interest rates, which left bonds mixed on the
day, failed to stir much enthusiasm for stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.31 to
1,956.44, finishing the week with a net gain of 3.85 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
618 up, 777 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 133.59 million shares,
down from 164.26 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
151.48 million shares.
   After rising sharply on Thursday, interest rates moved up again
in the credit markets in early trading Friday.
   Analysts cited a spreading belief that the Federal Reserve was
tightening credit further in response to evidence of continuing
strength in the economy.
   On Thursday the Commerce Department made a sharp upward revision
in its figure for economic growth during the first quarter of the
year.
   As the session passed, bonds attracted some buyers. ``The bond
market was comforted by the notion that policymakers are attempting
to snuff out inflation fears,'' said analysts as Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   But stocks apparently still suffered from neglect, with many
participants getting an early start on the long Memorial Day
weekend.

   The on-again, off-again deal between Donald
Trump and Merv Griffin to split up hotel-casino operator Resorts
International was officially sealed Friday, the millionaire
entrepreneurs announced.
   Griffin, the TV talk-show host turned investor, will pay
approximately $300 million for the Atlantic City, N.J., company
controlled by New York developer Trump, the men said.
   Using his profits from the deal and other funds, Trump will buy
back the company's unfinished crown jewel, the vast Taj Mahal
casino in Atlantic City, for $230 million.
   ``It looks like this is it,'' said Robert S. Trump, Donald's
brother and executive vice president of The Trump Organization, in
a telephone interview from New York. ``We are pleased, as I think
Mr. Griffin is pleased.''
   The agreement, in contrast to a handshake deal that collapsed
May 11 amid mutual recriminations, is definitive, Robert Trump said.
   The agreement calls for Trump, Resorts' chairman, to get a total
of $160 million _ $135 a share, or about $100 million, for his
Class B shares, and $60 million to terminate his management
contract. The Class B shares, which carry special voting rights,
give him 88 percent control of the company.
   In addition, Griffin, through Griffin Co., agreed to pay
approximately $200 million, or $36 a share, for all the company's
common stock, Robert Trump said.
   Trump agreed to pay $230 million for the Taj Mahal, a grandiose
project plagued by construction delays, and certain other assets.
That purchase is subject to certain closing adjustments, Robert
Trump said.
   Griffin first offered to buy Resorts on March 17 for $35 a share.
   After weeks of sparring, the men in April announced an agreement
nearly identical to the one closed Friday, only to cancel it a
month later, with Trump accusing Griffin of failing to line up
financing and Griffin accusing Trump of seeking last-minute changes.
