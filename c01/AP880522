   A man wanted for investigation of murder in
Ohio and attempted murder in New Jersey flagged down a police car
and surrendered after he was profiled on a national television
show, police said Saturday.
   Stephen Randall Dye, 46, stopped a patrolman about 9:45 p.m.
Friday in downtown San Diego, Sgt. Jim Long said.
   ``He must have seen his face on this nationwide program and
decided to give himself up,'' Long said. ``It all checked out and
he was the guy.''
   New Jersey authorities confirmed Dye's identity, Long said. He
was taken to the San Diego County jail to await extradition.
   Dye was featured on the May 8 episode of ``America's Most
Wanted,'' a Fox Broadcasting Co. show, said executive producer
Michael Linder.
   ``We received over 300 phone calls with tips from viewers. A
number of them placed him in San Diego and Southern California,''
Linder said.
   A county prosecutor's office in New Jersey had asked the show to
profile Dye because an alleged accomplice had been arrested and
authorities wanted to try them together, Linder said.
   The episode depicted an October 1986 incident in which Dye
allegedly shot John Mikrut twice at point-blank range in a house
trailer in Parsippany, N.J., Linder said. Mikrut survived the
attack and participated in the television program.
   The episode also portrayed the May 20, 1981, killing of a
motorcyclist in Cleveland, gave Dye's description and showed
pictures of him, Linder said.
   Linder said 17 people profiled on the program have been
apprehended since the show first aired Feb. 7, 10 of them because
of tips received from television viewers.

   An electrical failure spurred phone
outages that affected tens of thousands of residents over a
120-mile-wide area for several hours Saturday, making it impossible
for people to make even emergency calls.
   With 911 numbers not operating in the state's largest city,
police here were assigned to fire departments and major
intersections where they could be seen by people who might need
assistance.
   The failure affected an area from Boone, in the state's western
mountains to just west of Rockingham, 120 miles away in the
south-central part of teh state, Southern Bell Telephone Co.
officials said.
   A power failure at a main switching center, unprecedented for
the district, caused a total disruption of long-distance calls and
kept local calls to a trickle, phone company officials said.
   ``As long as anyone remembers, we have not had the main switch
fail. It is a power supply problem,'' said Bob Freedman, the
company's district manager.
   Officials of Duke Power Co., which provides electricity in
Charlotte, could not be reached for comment.
   Freedman said 40 phone company employees were brought in from
around Charlotte to work on the switching problem.
   ``We expect the phones to be working by morning,'' he said. ``We
have more power now than an hour ago.''
   Details of effects of the outage were difficult to obtain
Saturday night, as telephone calls from The Associated Press in
Raleigh to various authorities in 11 counties around Charlotte were
answered with a recording that said calls could not be completed
because circuits were busy.
   The situation caused confusion wherever telephone communications
with the Charlotte area were needed, as with Piedmont Airlines,
which has a hub at the Charlotte airport.
   ``We're not guaranteeing any connections in Charlotte because of
the blackout,'' said Joan Wells, a Piedmont agent at Newark
International Airport in New Jersey Saturday night.
   Charlotte is the largest city in the Carolinas, with about
315,000 people. Its metropolitan area, which borders South
Carolina, has more than a million people.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between the United States and
the Philippines on the future of American military bases are near
collapse because of wide differences between the two sides, Manila
newspapers report.
   U.S. officials declined comment on the reports, which appeared
Saturday and Sunday in most major dailies. The governments last
month began reviewing the current agreement under which the United
States maintains six installations here, including Subic Bay naval
base and Clark Air Base.
   Manila newspapers quoted an unnamed ``ranking Filipino
diplomat'' as saying the sides were ``worlds apart'' on virtually
every issue, including compensation, criminal jurisdiction and
security.
   The newspapers quoted the source as saying the Philippine
government would rather break off the talks ``than be criticized
later for succumbing to the Americans.''
   He accused the U.S. panel, led by Ambassador Nicholas Platt, of
``stonewalling'' on virtually every issue, the papers reported.
   American diplomats here have privately complained that the
Philippine panel violated an understanding by leaking details on
the negotiations, which began April 5.
   The current talks cover only the status of the bases through
1991, when the current agreement expires. However, the outcome is
expected to determine whether Manila allows the bases to remain
after 1991.
   Under the current constitution, any extension must be provided
for in a formal treaty approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate, where anti-bases sentiment is strong.
   President Corazon Aquino has agreed to honor the current
agreement but refuses to say whether she would support an
extension. Her term expires in 1992 and she has ruled out seeking
re-election.

   Sheriff's deputies seized an estimated
$80,000 in cocaine, marijuana and vehicles to cap a 10-month
undercover investigation into drug trafficking, an official said
Saturday.
   ``We had decided that we had already lost the war against drugs,
but we were going to win a few battles along the way,'' said
Detective Barry Tharp, of the Bradley County Sheriff's department's
criminal investigation division.
   At least 45 people were arrested late Friday and early Saturday.
Officers hoped to arrest 40 more on charges of selling and
delivering cocaine, marijuana and LSD, Tharp said.
   ``We've got a drug problem here, but we didn't expect it to be
this many people,'' he said. ``There's no way to eradicate drugs,
but we are trying to get what we can along the way.''

   Sammy Davis Sr., a vaudeville song-and-dance
man and father of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. died Saturday, a
publicist said. He was 87.
   Davis died at his Beverly Hills home of natural causes, Arnold
Lipsman said. Sammy Davis Jr. was to deliver the eulogy at public
services Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, said Dick
Fisher, a park spokesman.
   The elder Davis was born in Wilmington, N.C., the grandson of
slaves. He began a 40-year career in New York City by winning a
series of dance contests, then joined the Will Maston Trio after
World War I and went on to appear in vaudeville, on stage, and in
posh nightclubs, Lipsman said.
   Davis played Fletcher Henderson in the 1955 film, ``The Benny
Goodman Story'' and appeared on television with such celebrities as
Steve Allen, Eddie Cantor, Milton Berle and Jack Benny, Lipsman
said.
   Davis's last television performance was in 1973 with his son on
a General Electric special, Lipsman said.

Cape Girardeau, Mo., authorities said.
   Officials said the car crashed into the second engine of a
Burlington-Northern freight train at 10:14 a.m. at a railroad

   Sikh radicals shot and killed 15 people
across the northern Punjab state, and the government flew in
special anti-insurgency forces to combat escalating Sikh violence,
police said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, religious services were held for the first time in
two weeks Sunday at the Golden Temple, Sikhism's most sacred shrine
and the site of a bloody police siege that ended Wednesday.
   Services were led by temple priest Mohan Singh, who had been
released from police detention only a hour before religious rites
began. He was among the high priests arrested during the standoff
at the temple.
   Also Sunday, a bomb believed planted by Sikh extremists exploded
in a crowded railway waiting room in the town of Ludhiana, killing
four people and injuring at least 20, United News of India
reported. Ludhiana is 80 miles southeast of here.
   In response to a wave of Sikh violence that has followed the
siege, contingents of Assam Rifles, a specially trained
anti-guerrilla force, were flown into Punjab on Saturday, state
police chief K.P.S. Gill said.
   ``There is no going back from now on. We are determined to crush
terrorism,'' Gill told a news conference.
   Gill declined to say how many of the troops were brought to
Punjab, where Sikh radicals are waging a guerrilla war for a
separate Sikh nation.
   A committee of Sikh elders that administers the Golden Temple
met for a second day Saturday and agreed to cooperate with the
government to prevent militants from again turning the temple
complex into an armed camp.
   Radical Sikhs occupied the temple for 10 days during a standoff
with Indian police and commandoes who surrounded the complex. The
siege ended Wednesday with the surrender of the last 46 radicals
from the temple complex. At least 40 people died during the
standoff, most of them Sikh militants.
   Shiv Singh Khushipuri, a member of the committee of elders, said
the group decided Saturday it would prohibit anyone from living in
the offices that surround the temple and would insist that weapons
be left outside the complex by visitors. Sikh extremists in the
past have used the offices as hiding places from police.
   Bhan Singh, secretary of the committee, said a compromise
formula was reached after police said they would release some Sikh
priests from prison.
   Four militant Sikh priests were arrested May 12 when they defied
a curfew and tried to march on the occupied shrine.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
an independent homeland for their minority sect. The Sikhs claim
they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus.
   On Saturday, Sikh gunmen shot and killed nine migrant workers in
Amritsar district and one more in Kapurthala district.
   On Thursday night, Sikh extremists ordered Hindu migrants at a
camp in Amritsar District to line up against a wall and shot five
of them to death and injured several others.
   The latest attack took place early Saturday in the village of
Gujarpura in Amritsar District.
   Chaman Lal, inspector general of the paramilitary Border
Security Force, said a half-dozen extremists opened fire with
Chinese-made AK-47 rifles on the sleeping workers, killing nine and
injuring three others.
   Recent attacks on migrant workers have prompted the exodus of
hundreds of the Hindu laborers who traditionally migrate from the
northern states of Bihar and Orissa to help with planting in
Punjab, India's richest agricultural state. Indian newspapers have
speculated that the Sikh extremists are trying to destroy the
state's economy by undercutting the farmers.
   One migrant laborer was murdered overnight in Punjab's
Karpurthala District to the east of Amritsar.
   In two other attacks in Patiala and Gurdashpur districts, Sikh
gunmen shot and killed four people.
   The latest killings raised to at least 1,141 the number of
people slain by Sikh extremists since the start of the year in
Punjab. Last year, 1,030 people died in terrorist violence.
   The government issued a statewide police alert in Punjab on
Friday and sent 9,000 police and paramilitary troops across the
state to raid hideouts of Sikh extremists.
   More than 200 people have been murdered by suspected Sikh
militants since the police siege of the temple complex began.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but are a majority in Punjab.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Firestone Inc. and the
United Rubber Workers reached a tentative agreement early Sunday,
ending a week-long walkout that idled 4,700 URW members in six
states.
   The agreement was approved at 5 a.m. Sunday after a bargaining
session that began at 1:15 p.m. Saturday, URW spokesman Curt Brown
said. It was the first round of talks since the strike began.
   The three-year pact was similar to a settlement the URW reached
May 17 with the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Brown said.
   ``We would anticipate people (at the six Firestone plants
affected by the strike) starting to return to work this (Sunday)
evening,'' Brown said. He also said voting on the proposal should
take place this week.
   Like the Goodyear agreement, the one with Firestone would boost
wages by 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from future
cost-of-living adjustments in increments.
   The Firestone agreement also would increase pensions for retired
workers by amounts ranging from $20 to $23.50 per month for each
year of service. In addition, current retirees would receive a lump
sum bonus of $200 before Dec. 1.
   The pact includes improvements in employee savings and health
insurance plans, a clause which assures continuation of the
contract if a Firestone plant is sold to another company during the
next three years, and a no-strike wage re-opener clause in the
third year.
   The Goodyear pact was assured of approval Friday when a URW
local in Danville, Va., voted by a 2-1 ratio to accept the
contract. It was the second Goodyear proposal to be put to a vote.
Brown said he expected to announce a final tally on the Goodyear
voting by Monday.
   URW members walked out May 15 at Firestone facilities in Akron;
Noblesville, Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville,
Ark.; and Oklahoma City.
   The Des Moines, Decatur and Oklahoma City plants make tires; the
Noblesville plant makes molded rubber products and the Russellville
plant makes innertubes.
   URW employees at Firestone's tire division headquarters in Akron
are maintenance workers.

<TEXT>
   A car apparently hit by a firebomb burst into
flames Sunday and killed a Palestinian woman and her son. Hospital
officials said another Arab died of a gunshot wound after a
confrontation with Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank.
   Three Arab teen-agers were wounded in two separate clashes and
an Israeli man was in intensive care after being burned in a
firebomb attack, the officials and Israel radio said.
   The army confirmed the deaths and said it was investigating the
causes.
   The violence occurred as about 12,000 Palestinian children
returned to schools in east Jerusalem for the first time in more
than three months. Israel closed the schools during the height of
the Arab uprising, which began Dec. 8.
   Sunday's deaths brought to 194 the number of Palestinians who
have died in the anti-occupation unrest, according to U.N. figures.
Two Israelis have also been killed.
   Shamseh Al Kadah, 65, and her son Mohammed Salah Ghanem, 36, of
the village of Shuweika, died when their car caught fire in the
West Bank town of Tulkarem as they drove from Tulkarem Hospital
where Ghanem's wife was giving birth, hospital officials said.
   An official at Israel's Pathological Institute, Abu Kabir, said
the two apparently died in a firebombing attack.
   Arab witnesses said the fire occurred after soldiers fired
warning shots toward the car, which was traveling through a closed
military zone.
   Kawther Miri, 23, of a refugee camp near Tulkarem, died of a
bullet wound to the chest suffered during clashes with soldiers
Saturday, said an official at Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus where
she was treated.
   Also Sunday, hundreds of protesters in Nablus hurled rocks at
soldiers on an avenue named for slain Palestine Liberation
Organization military commander Khalil Wazir, hospital officials
said. Israel has been blamed for the April 16 slaying.
   Two 19-year-old youths were wounded by bullets in the legs and
three were treated for beating injuries, said officials at Nablus'
Al Ittihad Hospital.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers clashed Saturday night with
protesters at the Deir El Balah refugee camp, wounding an
18-year-old youth in the right leg, officials at Gaza City's Ahli
Arab Hospital said.
   Yaacov Askayo of Jerusalem was being treated Sunday in an
intensive care unit for severe burns suffered after his vehicle was
hit by a firebomb in the West Bank city of Jericho, Israel radio
said.
   But the wave of unrest apparently died down in the
Israeli-annexed quarters of Jerusalem, and Israeli officials
reopened schools on Sunday.
   Israel reopened 31 kindergarten, elementary and high schools in
east Jerusalem and the radio said about 80 percent of a student
body of 16,000 showed up for classes. Pupils will have to attend an
extra hour of classes daily and give up part of their summer
vacations to make up for the lost time.
   But private schools, which closed themselves at about the same
time, did not reopen.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 2,000 Hindus, Buddhists and
Christians marched toward Parliament on Sunday to protest proposed
legislation to establish Islam as the state religion of Bangladesh,
witnesses said.
   The bill, introduced in Parliament on May 11, sparked criticism
from major opposition parties, women's rights organizations and
secular groups.
   Riot police blocked the protestors about a mile from the
Parliament building, according to witnesses. The police permitted a
small delegation of demonstrators to drive up to the Parliament
building and deliver a written protest.
   Sunday's march was organized by a council comprised of
Bangladesh's three largest minorities _ Hindus, Christians and
Buddhists _ who account for 13 percent of the total population. The
group was formed after the introduction of the bill.
   In the protest memorandum, the council said that ``declaration
of Islam as the only state religion will result in destroying
national unity, curtailing equal rights of other communities and
even encouraging them to take a separatist stand.''
   Critics have said the move could cause friction between
religions and curtail women's rights, since under Islamic lawsm
women are discouraged from appearing in public.
   ``It is also feared that this Islamization move may be followed
by a separate electorate of the minority communities,'' the
memorandum added.
   An official of the governing Jatiya Party, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that the
Parliament will begin debating the bill ``shortly.'' The party
controls 215 seats in the 300-member Parliament following elections
in March that were boycotted by opposition groups.
   ``We shall not allow the illegal Parliament to pass any bill or
amend the Constitution. (President Hussain Muhammad) Ershad is
playing with fire,'' warned Sheikh Hasina, president of the Awami
League, a major opposition group. She spoke at a meeting Sunday.
   Ershad, who sponsored the legislation, has assured minority
groups that their rights will not be curtailed by the establishment
of Islam as the state religion.
   Vice President Nurul Islam told a meeting of Moslem religious
leaders in Dhaka on Saturday that ``the move to make Islam (a state
religion) is a pragmatic step since more than 87 percent of
Bangladesh population is Moslem.''
   ``Islam is a complete code of life and hence it cannot be seen
isolated from politics,'' Islam said.
   Under the country's first constitution, framed in 1972,
secularism was established as one of the four basic principles of
the state, created in 1971 after a war of independence against
Pakistan, which is 97 percent Moslem.
   ``The move for making Islam a state religion goes against the
principles and values of our liberation war in 1971,'' said Hasina.
   The push to institutionalize Islam got under way in 1977 when
then-President Ziaur Rahman altered the constitution with a clause
declaring ``complete faith'' in the Moslem religion.

   A brawl broke out on a ferry crossing
the English Channel, and the crew was forced to return to port at
Cherbourg where 13 young British men were arrested, French
immigration police said Sunday.
   About 30 people began fighting shortly after the P and O ferry
Viking Voyager left Cherbourg on Saturday night for Portsmouth,
England, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   When crew members were unable to control the fight, the captain
returned to Cherbourg and asked immigration police to board his
ship and take off 13 men described as ``hooligans.''
   The 13 were led in handcuffs to police headquarters and
released. Because the brawl took place at sea aboard a ship
registered in Britain, any charges will have to be pressed by
British authorities, the French police said.
   No injuries were reported. It was not known what sparked the
fight.

   A quarter of a century after its
founding, the Organization of African Unity is anything but united.
   The group celebrates is silver anniversary beset by religious,
political and ethnic differences and haunted by its inability to
topple South Africa and that nation's system of racial segregation.
   When the OAU, the world's largest continental organization, was
formed on May 25, 1963, two-thirds of the current members still
were under colonial rule.
   The group chose Ethiopia as its headquarters, the only African
country never under the yoke of colonialists.
   In the cramped Africa Hall, the organization conducts annual
summits under the paintings of its 32 founders _ only two of whom
remain in power, Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast and King
Hassan II of Morocco.
   Of the other 30 founders, 24 were overthrown in coups or
revolutions, three died peacefully in office and three stepped
aside to make way for a younger generation of leaders.
   Its 50 members are seemingly at an impasse over how to gain
liberation for the blacks of South Africa and for neighboring
Namibia, under South Africa's control.
   On Sunday, delegates at an OAU foreign ministers' meeting
debated South Africa. Activists berated the group for not giving
enough money to anti-apartheid groups, while organization members
criticized the groups for lack of unity.
   Indeed, the organization's 22-year-old Liberation Committee,
which once helped finance freedom fights, now dispenses more
rhetoric than action. Members owe the committee $12 million.
   ``A statement or resolution reaffirming commitment to the
national liberation movements are certainly welcome. But more
welcome would be checks wiping off respective arrears to the OAU
Liberation Committee,'' said Gora Ebrahim of the anti-apartheid
Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa.
   Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, the new chairman
of the Liberation Committee, countered that the Pan-Africanist
Congress should close ranks with its guerrilla rival, the African
National Congress, and fight South Africa's white-led government
together.
   Meanwhile, black Africa does $1 billion in business with South
Africa each year, much of it covertly.
   Though the organization's successes are few, some say its very
survival must be considered a victory.
   ``Our detractors have been predicting the demise of the OAU
since its inception,'' said one southern African delegate who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``That it can commemorate its 25th
anniversary is an achievement in itself.''
   The most serious threat to the organization's survival was in
1983-84, when most of the members balked at attending scheduled
summits in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Conservative African states _ with pressure from Western
governments _ stayed away from the meetings because it would have
meant that Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi would have become the
OAU's next chairman.
   The OAU customarily appointed the leader of a host country as
chairman for one year. The organization later appointed President
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya to the ceremonial position.
   The OAU later abandoned its policy of rotating annual summits
among various African capitals and made Ethiopia its permanent
venue.
   In 1984, charter member Morocco became the only county to quit
the OAU after the OAU admitted as a member the Polisario Front, a
guerrilla movement that has been fighting Morocco since 1975 over
the mineral-rich Western Sahara.
   Beneath the OAU's veneer of unity are rivalries between Arab and
black African members, Moslem and Christian members, and capitalist
and socialist states.
   The OAU has pushed for regional trade agreements, but most
African countries' biggest trading partners remain their former
colonizers.
   Fewer than half the heads of state ever attend OAU summits.
   ``But when there is a Commonwealth or Franco-African summit, all
African heads of state attend,'' OAU Secretary-General Idi Oumarou
of Niger said in an interview.
   The OAU is bound by its charter not to interfere in the internal
affairs of members, a dictate that silences the organization on
many issues.
   Africa kept quiet while Idi Amin, the former Uganda dictator and
OAU chairman in 1975, massacred 500,000 of his people during a
nine-year rule.
   The silence was broken only when former President Julius Nyerere
of Tanzania sent his troops into Uganda in 1979 to help rebels
overthrow Amin.
   The question of human rights is only raised in reference to
South Africa's system of apartheid, which allows the 26 million
blacks no vote in national affairs and gives the 5 million whites
control of the economy and separate districts, schools and health
services.

<HEAD>Reynolds Orders `Long Knives' Sheathed at Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a week of divided loyalties at the Justice
Department, civil rights chief William Bradford Reynolds tried to
defend Attorney General Edwin Meese III while remaining true to a
friend that Meese had just fired, department spokesman Terry
Eastland.
   Reynolds' efforts at damage control reflected his burgeoning
influence at the department as the attorney general's troubles have
mounted.
   A remark by the attorney general appeared in print Wednesday
contradicting Eastland's explanation that Meese had dismissed him
for not defending the attorney general aggressively enough.
   ``Baloney,'' Meese had said when asked whether he had fired
Eastland for inadequately defending him.
   Reynolds, who is Meese's counselor and long a member of his
inner circle, quickly consulted the attorney general and then
reiterated an order he had put out previously _ no one was to say
anything negative about Eastland, according to department sources
who discussed the events on condition they not be identified.
   Meese's political aides were told by Reynolds ``to keep the long
knives sheathed,'' said one department source. The motivation, said
the source, was to avoid an unseemly public feud with Eastland.
   Meese didn't repeat the ``baloney'' quote and doggedly stuck
with the explanation that he was replacing his chief spokesman
simply because it was time for a change in leadership. Meanwhile,
Eastland maintained his silence on details surrounding his firing
and continued to say that he feels the attorney general is honest
and well-intentioned.
   Reynolds' role in Eastland's firing remains unclear.
   Department sources said that while Reynolds knew Meese and
Eastland were to have a late-afternoon meeting on May 14 about how
to handle department issues and criticism, they insist that
Reynolds had no idea Meese was contemplating relieving Eastland of
his duties.
   But several other department sources say Reynolds and the
attorney general work together so closely that Reynolds almost
certainly had to have helped bring about Eastland's dismissal. They
say Reynolds had long taken a more aggressive approach than
Eastland in responding to criticism of Meese and the department.
   The Eastland dismissal, which was publicly disclosed last
Monday, has put Reynolds and other Meese loyalists who also are
friends of Eastland in a difficult position.
   Over a period of several years, Eastland and Reynolds frequently
jogged together. Reynolds was instrumental in getting Meese to hire
Eastland as director of the department's public affairs office in
1985.
   When Reynolds was preparing to attack various Supreme Court
decisions, the speech-writing duties for the project were carried
out by the staunchly conservative Eastland and Gary McDowell, who
last week said the Eastland firing was ``the worst mistake'' Meese
has made as attorney general.
   Eastland's wife had worked for Reynolds in the Justice
Department's civil rights division, which Reynolds heads. Eastland
and his wife were among the small group of friends at Reynolds'
wedding last year.
   Reynolds was out front in the chorus of praise for Eastland last
week. At the same time, he led the charge when it came to defending
Meese.
   After the conservative Washington Times, in the wake of the
Eastland firing, called on Meese to resign, Reynolds wrote a
rebuttal saying the newspaper had joined ``the chants of those who
despise everything the Reagan administration stands for in the
fields of criminal justice and constitutional law.''
   When Meese's private attorneys last week attacked as inaccurate
a Senate subcommittee's report critical of Meese's ties to
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., Reynolds sent a strongly worded
cover letter saying other subcommittee members hadn't been given a
chance to vote on the panel's findings.
   An heir to the Du Pont fortune, Reynolds has served as assistant
attorney general in charge of the department's civil rights
division since 1981, espousing the Reagan administration's
controversial policies in that area. He took on the additional job
of counselor a year ago.
   Reynolds was one of a handful of trusted political aides Meese
chose to conduct a November 1986 inquiry into the Reagan
administration's arms sales to Iran. It was Reynolds who discovered
the memo outlining a diversion of a portion of the proceeds from
the arms sales, precipitating the Iran-Contra scandal.

<HEAD>On the Campaign Trail, Bush Nurtures Love-Hate Relationship with
High-Tech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is waging a private battle on the
campaign trail with things that grind, whir, hum and clank. It's a
love-hate relationship with heavy machinery.
   The vice president appears to be perpetually climbing into
cockpits of airplanes, easing himself behind the wheels of trucks
and farm equipment, climbing into boats, pulling levers on assembly
lines and donning helmets, hard hats and laboratory smocks.
   Hardly a campaign day goes by without at least one carefully
orchestrated event in which Bush gets a chance to pose for cameras
inside, around or on top of some form of heavy equipment.
   Plant visits are standard campaign fare, and Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis has been doing his own share of
factory tours. But Bush, without any Republican opposition to worry
about, seems to have more time to squeeze such events into his
schedule. And he approaches machinery with a certain gusto all his
own.
   But not all of Bush's encounters with technology are successful.
   At a Procter and Gamble plant near Cincinnati, Bush pressed a
switch to start a machine that sent toothpaste flowing through a
labyrinth of pipes. He was invited to hold a waiting empty
tootpaste tube, its bottom open, under a spigot.
   A quizzical expression flashed across his face as only a few
drops trickled into his tube, while a torrent of the green gooey
stuff gushed out of a nearby pipe into a waste barrel.
   At the General Dynamics aircraft production plant in Fort Worth,
Texas, Bush climbed inside a flight simulater to ``fly'' an F-16
fighter jet. But the former World War II torpedo bomber pilot
admitted sheepishly afterward that he had brought the plane down
too hard on the runway, unintentionally simulating a near-crash
landing.
   Bush dresses up _ or down _ as each occasion warrants, so flight
jackets and pilot helmets appear for those frequent climbs into
aircraft cockpits. At a semiconductor plant in Oregon, Bush was
garbed in a ``full FAB bunny suit,'' special head-to-toe overalls
designed to keep dust at a minimum.
   But even for Bush there are limits. After all, there are still
those ``wimp'' accusations that come up from time to time.
   So on a tour of the Hershey chocolate factory in Pennsylvania,
reporters, Secret Service agents and Bush aides were ordered to don
hairnets (a gesture to cleanliness), while the vice president was
allowed to cover his head with a hard hat.
   Unlike Walter Mitty, the James Thurber character who could only
daydream of a secret life, Bush gets to act out other people's jobs
_ at least for the duration of a five or 10-minute ``photo
opportunity.''
   At the Cleveland Clinic, Bush donned a white medical coat and
held a mechanical heart in his hands as he conferred with a group
of physicians and researchers. Bush said he thought the heart
seemed awfully heavy, suggesting the patient would have to be
``fairly robust.''
   That is a potential problem, he was told. It was one site where
Bush wasn't invited to participate further.
   He toured an IBM center in Thornwood, N.Y., and was given an
exhibit of a computer-aided robotics manufacturing system and
watched as a robot arm assembled a delicate piece of equipment. Did
he want to take a stab at making the robot reassemble the device?
   ``I don't know what the hell it is,'' Bush confessed.
   At Fort Wayne, Bush toured a plant that makes military radios.
He was invited to get behind the wheel of a Jeep to inspect one. He
promptly climbed into the passenger seat instead _ possibly
exhibiting a long-ingrained vice presidential tendency.
   A few days later, Bush helped drive a few rivets into a
``Hummer,'' the all-purpose military vehicle that is replacing the
Jeep, and was invited to take one out for a spin.
   ``I'm going to get in the right side of the car this time,'' he
joked.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the candidate's
frequent visits to plants are intended to ``show clearly that he is
concerned about the economy as it relates to people, to
individuals... You can talk about jobs, but it's important to
relate to people on a personal level.''
   The campaign also wants to suggest that Bush is looking to the
future and that's why high-tech plants are favored, Fuller said.
``These are jobs that are going to lead up to the 21st Century,''
he said.
   But sometimes even nature seems to conspire against Bush.
   There he was, in an open barn on a family farm in southeastern
Idaho, ready to go out and inspect some irrigation equipment in
this dry region of the country where it almost never rains.
   It poured.

<HEAD>Scholarship Program Turns Grades Into Dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve-year-old Adrienne Carter already has
$160 socked away for college, and she's earning more each day
through an innovative program that rewards public school students
with dollars for good grades.
   Adrienne plans to use the money she stockpiles through the
Scholarship-In-Escrow program to study architecture or interior
design after she graduates from high school in five years.
   ``I really, really want to become something in this world,''
said Adrienne, a seventh-grader at the Cleveland School of Science.
``In order to do that, you need a good education.''
   Adrienne earned the $160 with three A's, one B and a C, a grade
that she's determined to improve. ``When I see A's it makes me
happy that I did that good,'' she said.
   The scholarship program is the brainchild of Alfred D. Tutela,
superintendent of the city school system, and is a joint project of
the system and the Greater Cleveland Roundtable, a group of civic
and business leaders.
   The project is designed to keep students in school, motivate
them to improve their grades and encourage them to continue their
education after graduation.
   The Roundtable has solicited commitments for $12 million of the
$16 million needed to fund the program for five years, mostly from
Cleveland foundations and corporations such as TRW Inc., Eaton
Corp. and BP America Inc.
   A growing number of school systems around the country are
adopting similar pay-to-learn plans, but the Cleveland program is
believed to be the only one that encompasses all students in a
district.
   At the School of Science, 14-year-old Bouk Sim said some of his
eighth-grade classmates are competing among themselves to improve
their grades.
   ``I think it's going to make a lot of difference. Before they
didn't have a reason to do their work, but now they're being paid
to get A's, B's and C's,'' he said.
   Tutela said he suggested the scholarship program to fight the
district's ``horrendous'' dropout problem.
   Fifty percent of the students who enter Cleveland's public
schools don't graduate with their classmates, although 15 percent
do re-enroll at some point, he said. Of those who graduate, only 25
percent go on to college, according to the superintendent.
   The scholarship program is actually half of a two-pronged
project. The School-to-Work Transition Program, an expansion of an
existing program, provides job-readiness training and grants
graduates priority for entry-level jobs.
   Through both programs, Tutela said, he wants to break the
pattern of failure among the district's 73,000 students and
motivate them to achieve.
   ``Failure is learned and accepted. It's one thing to fail and
say I'm going to improve. It's another thing to fail and say that's
all I can do,'' he said in an interview last week. ``Motivate kids
to achieve, and achievement will then motivate itself.''
   Tutela said motivation has to start at an early age ``before
they get into puberty, before they've got their mind-sets.'' During
visits to schools last September, he said even the youngest
children knew about the scholarship program, which had been
announced last summer.
   To illustrate the point, Tutela popped unannounced into a
third-grade class and asked: ``What do you have to do to go to
college?''
   ``Work hard,'' responded a handful of the startled youngsters.
   Beginning with the grading period that ended April 15, students
in grades 7 through 12 earn $40 for an A, $20 for a B and $10 for a
C in English, mathematics, foreign language, social studies and
science. Students in honors courses receive a $10 bonus per course.
   In six years, a straight A student can accrue as much as $4,800,
or $6,000 if enrolled in honors courses. The money will be held in
a trust fund and can be used for up to eight years after graduation
for college, technical or vocational training programs.
   The money will be paid directly to the institution. If the
student doesn't graduate from the school district or fails to use
the money within eight years, the money remains in the fund.
   Many Cleveland-area universities and colleges have agreed to
match or supplement the scholarship program for students who attend
their schools.
   Tutela said he'll consider the program a success if the number
of college-bound students doubles.
   ``When are we going to see the return? Is it going to work?
We'll see that beyond us,'' he said. ``But when teachers and kids
are talking about college and achievement and they start connecting
their relationship, something has got to be going on.''

<HEAD>Reagan's Anti-Communist Rhetoric Dates Back Nearly Four Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The confrontational tone of President Reagan's
pre-summit rhetoric apparently came as a surprise to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, even though the president has been using
similar anti-communist rhetoric for nearly four decades.
   Reagan takes to Moscow the view that the relationship between
the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter how gentlemanly
it becomes, is a conflict between good and evil.
   ``He is probably facing realities, what appear to him realities
now, but his likes and dislikes are probably the same as they were
all along,'' says Vladimir Petrov, professor emeritus of
international affairs at George Washington University.
   Gorbachev reacted with dismay after the president made a world
affairs council speech in Springfield, Mass., on April 21 boasting
that his has been the administration that ``said communism was
bad.''
   He's been saying that, however, ever since his days as a movie
actor.
   In 1951, testifying at a House Committee on Un-American
Activities hearing on alleged communist influence in Hollywood,
Reagan said, ``I abhor their philosophy, but I detest their tactics
which are those of a fifth column and are dishonest.''
   That was when he was still a Democrat. After he became a
Republican, he was more outspoken.
   In 1981, in his first news conference as president, Reagan said,
``The only morality they recognize is what will further their
cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any
crime, to lie, to cheat in order to attain that.''
   The next year, in a speech to members of the British Parliament
in London, the president spoke of ``a march of freedom and
democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of
history.''
   In a speech in Orlando, Fla., in March, 1983, during the
national debate on the nuclear weapons freeze movement, he
cautioned members of the evangelical clergy against being tempted
to ``label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of
history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply
call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove
yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and
evil.''
   In Springfield, Reagan returned to the same theme, saying of his
administration, ``We acknowledged the depth of our disagreements
and their fundamental, moral import. In this way, we acknowledged
that the differences that separated us and the Soviets were deeper
and wider than just missile counts and numbers of warheads.''
   He also said that by ``making a moral and spiritual point'' of
East-West differences, his administration had steered U.S.-Soviet
relations toward ``a period of realistic engagement.''
   In that spirit, he accused the Soviets of backing regimes that
were ``an outrage to the conscience of mankind'' and said that if
the Soviet Union was changing it was ``because the costs of
aggression and the real moral difference between our systems were
brought home to it.''
   Gorbachev, decrying this ``confrontational'' approach, said,
``We have so far been showing restraint, but if we reciprocate _
and we can do so over a very wide range of issues _ the atmosphere
of Soviet-American relations can become such that it will make it
no longer possible to solve any further issues.''
   The Soviet leader appeared to lament a departure from the
atmosphere of cordiality that prevailed at his summit meeting with
Reagan in Washington in December.
   During a break in that meeting, the president told a group of
columnists that Gorbachev, unlike past Soviet leaders, had not
``openly expressed ... acceptance of the Marxian theory of the
one-world communist state'' and that he seemed to believe in
``competitive societies ... living in peace in the world together.''
   Reagan also said, however, ``I haven't softened up ... this
doesn't mean that I'm dropping my guard or anything.''
   ``It's a very odd situation,'' said Michael R. Beschloss, an
adjunct historian at the Smithsonian Institution and author of a
recent book that describes the abortive Eisenhower-Khruschev summit
of 1960 _ the last time a Republican president winding up two full
terms in office went to see a Soviet leader.
   ``On the one hand, he (Reagan) has been very bitter in his
estimate of what motivates the Soviet Union, and if he were still
to believe that, it would conflict with what he has been doing over
the past year. He has tried to paper that over by saying that
Gorbachev is a new type of Soviet leader. That has got him in great
trouble with conservatives.''
   In the view of some experts, Gorbachev may be in a similar
situation at home.
   ``Quite possibly there are also people around him in Moscow who
don't like the many concessions he has made to the United States,
and he has to stand up in order to demonstrate to his associates
that he is no pushover,'' said Petrov.
   ``Maybe Gorbachev doesn't think he has been adequately rewarded
by the United States for his being so forthcoming, that we keep on
growling even if he delivered more than his predecessors ever could
or would.''
   There probably will be more smiles than growls in the public
meetings in Moscow, but not because Ronald Reagan has changed his
views.
   ``I wasn't up on the communists,'' he once said in looking back
on his days with the Screen Actors Guild. He has had some 40 years
to bone up on them, and his lesson is still, as he put in a 1985
speech to the United Nations:
   ``We Americans do not accept that any government has the right
to command and order the lives of its people, that any nation has
an historic right to use force to export its ideology. This belief
regarding the nature of man and the limitations of government is at
the core of our deep and abiding differences with the Soviet Union,
differences that put us into natural conflict _ and competition _
with one another.''

<HEAD>From Texas to Togo: A Ninth Grader Reaches His Goal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rush Walker Taylor Jr. doesn't remember making
a speech in ninth grade about wanting to be an ambassador. But at
least one of his classmates in Crockett, Texas, four decades later,
remembers.
   And when word from Washington reached Crockett that Taylor was
on his way to West Africa as envoy to Togo _ a ribbon of savanna,
hills and coastal plains _ the classmate reminded the career
diplomat in a letter of those dreams so long ago, born in the piney
woods of East Texas.
   Taylor's father, a clothing company salesman whose territory
covered a big chunk of East Texas, moved his family from Arkansas
to Crockett, which now has about 7,500 inhabitants, when Rush Jr.
was 8.
   They settled into a house built in 1830, where Davy Crockett
spent the night on his way to the Alamo, and it was there in one of
the earliest cities in Texas that Taylor decided to become an
ambassador.
   A teacher who had traveled in Europe kindled his interest in
history and the world, and by the time he was in high school,
Taylor was determined to work for the foreign service. He began his
career with the State Department in 1962, after graduating from
Harvard and the University of Virginia law school and serving in
the U.S. Army for two years.
   President Reagan in April nominated Taylor to be ambassador to
Togo, a sliver of country smaller than West Virginia that the State
Department says is one of the world's least developed. It has a per
capita income of $250.
   Taylor is to be sworn in on Thursday and when he leaves for the
capital, Lome, in June, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says Taylor will
be taking a knowledge of the United States molded by life in
small-town America.
   ``I think it's helpful, when you've got people around the world
representing America who are from smaller towns and who understand
the fundamental values of America. If you're going to represent
American interests you have to know what they are,'' said Gramm.
``You can't grow up in Crockett and not understand America.''
   ``He combines the best in rural roots, good education, small
town boy makes good, in an area that has until pretty recently been
dominated by people who were primarily very high income people,''
said Gramm, who introduced Taylor to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee when it considered the nomination.
   Since word first got out, Taylor said he's received more than a
dozen phone calls and letters of congratulations from people in
Crockett who he had not see since school.
   ``One guy reminded me of when we were in ninth grade, when I
made some kind of speech about wanting to be an ambassador. I had
forgotten, but he had not,'' he said.
   Taylor, 53, who will be serving in his first ambassadorial post,
has had other African assignments, in Yaounde, Cameroon, in the
early 1960s, and in Guinea-Bissau. He also has worked in
Washington, Rome, Florence, Portugal and the Bahamas.
   He said the United States ``couldn't ask for better relations
with the government of Togo,'' although U.S. efforts are dwarfed by
the contributions of France.
   Togo has an open, commercially oriented economy with a liberal
investment code, the State Department said. It is a predominately
agricultural country, and exports phosphates, cotton, coffee and
cocoa.

   Rival Moslem militias blasted the
tenements and shacks of south Beirut on Sunday with mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades. Pro-Iranian extremists pledged to
protect Western hostages held in the slums, a newspaper reported.
   The nation's leading Shiite Moslem cleric said he would work to
end the hostage situation.
   Police said six people were killed and 14 wounded in the 17th
day of fighting between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the
Syrian-backed Amal militias.
   The casualties brought the overall toll to 266 killed and 873
injured since fighting broke out May 6 for control of the slums,
where extremists linked to Hezbollah are believed holding 18
Western hostages, including nine Americans.
   Syrian troops appeared poised to enter the area.
   ``There is no way to stop the fighting other than a Syrian
military deployment,'' Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military
intelligence chief in Lebanon, said in a statement broadcast by
Beirut radio stations.
   He did not set a deadline for deployment in the warren of narrow
alleys and cement-block shanties that serves as a base for
pro-Iranian kidnappers, aircraft hijackers and assassins.
   But Kenaan said: ``By the time we deploy, I hope there will be
no hostages left in captivity.'' He did not elaborate.
   On Saturday, U.S. envoy Vernon Walters said Syria was aware it
could endanger the hostages by moving into the slums.
   Walters, the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, met with
Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus, Syria.
   ``I'm sure that the president is very much aware of the possible
dangers and the possible advantages of such an action,'' Walters
said.
   The Al-Ittihad newspaper of Abu Dhabi reported Sunday that
Hezbollah has pledged to safeguard all hostages held in the slums
as part of a negotiated, 8-point agreement to regulate the Syrian
deployment.
   The daily quoted unnamed sources in Beirut as saying the pledge
was made after Syria warned that ``any harm befalling the hostages
will be regarded as an aggressive act against Syria.''
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said ``I feel with the families of the hostages, and I am doing all
I can to reach a happy ending.''
   Fadlallah promised to ``invest all my energies'' to resolve the
hostage problem and said: ``I am still exerting pressure to reach a
humanitarian solution.'' He did not say who he was pressuring.
   Fadlallah released his statement late Saturday through Ray
Barnett, a Canadian clergyman who represents the U.S.-based Friends
in the West, a Christian Human Rights Group that has been working
for release of the hostages.
   Barnett, hoped to deliver to Fadlallah a petition signed by
40,000 people from various countries pleading for the Moslem
cleric's help to secure safe release of the hostages.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Fadlallah, who lives in south Beirut, his two-story residence
riddled with shell pocks and bullet scars, has dropped his
opposition to the entry of Syrian forces into the slums.
   ``The doors of the suburbs are open for the Syrian army,'' he
said in an interview published Sunday by the conservative Beirut
Al-Anwar newspaper. ``No party in the suburbs intends to confront
the Syrians.''
   The Syrians massed troops, tanks and armored vehicles around the
slums after Hezbollah overran Amal positions to seize control of 90
percent of the urban battle ground.
   In previous statements, Fadlallah said there was no need for a
Syrian military intervention, warning that ``the whole suburbs will
be destroyed if the Syrians move in.''
   Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, attributed
his change of stance to Iranian pressure.
   They said Iranian mediators have told Hezbollah leaders that
Iran views its alliance with Syria in its war against Iraq as more
important than Hezbollah's interests in Lebanon.
   Syria considers Lebanon to be within its sphere of influence. It
has been angered by Iran's attempt to use Hezbollah to control the
1.2 million Shiites who make up the largest sect among Lebanon's 4
million people.
   Iran's deputy foreign ministers Hossein Sheikholeslam and Ali
Mohammed Besharati have been shuttling between Damascus and Beirut
for two weeks to help end the fighting and avert a Hezbollah
collision with the Syrian army.

   Denver Mayor Federico Pena and law
school graduate Ellen Hart were wed this weekend in a Catholic
ceremony at the University of New Mexico campus.
   The marriage is the first for both Hart, 30, and the 41-year-old
Pena, who is Denver's first Hispanic mayor.
   Saturday's wedding capped a year of triumph for Pena, whose
political career nearly came to a halt last year. He finished
second to political newcomer Don Bain in last year's re-election
primary before narrowly defeating Bain in the runoff.
   Then, this year, the Democratic mayor survived a recall attempt
by ex-city workers and others who accused him of fiscal
irresponsibility and were unhappy with the cleanup from a December
snowstorm.
   In March, things began turning around for Pena, with the signing
of contracts for construction of a convention center and the
ground-breaking last month.
   And last week, in a major victory for the mayor, voters approved
a plan to annex 45 square miles of Adams County for a new $3
billion airport for Denver.
   In a sun-drenched garden prior to the ceremony, Pena said, ``We
were worried about the rain, but everybody prayed extra hard and
it's beautiful.'' Pena said the couple would honeymoon for 10 days
in Spain.
   ``We haven't had a chance to take much time off,'' he said.
``It's been a hectic week.
   The groom had been considered one of Denver's most eligible
bachelors until his engagement to Hart.
   The bride, an avid distance runner, met Pena four years ago at
the Mayor's Cup 10-mile race in Denver.
   A fine arts graduate of Harvard University, she graduated this
month from the University of Colorado School of Law in Boulder,
Colo. Her father is former dean of the University of New Mexico Law
School.
   She said she hopes to work in family law, American Indian law
and possibly sports law.

<HEAD>House Panel Moving Cautiously in Impeachment Proceedings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dark cloud of controversy hangs over House
impeachment proceedings against federal judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami, giving some members of the Judiciary Committee's
investigative panel an uncomfortable case of election-year jitters.
   The panel is moving reluctantly and with great caution for two
reasons. One concerns the possibility of setting a historic
precedent. The other is the question whether in 1988, when a black
man is running for president, America is truly colorblind.
   The House has impeached 11 federal judges for ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in its 200-year history. Only five of them were
subsequently convicted by the Senate and removed from office.
   But never has a federal judge been impeached after being
acquitted of criminal charges, according to the Senate historians.
If impeached, Hastings would be the first.
   His case also is unprecedented because Hastings, unlike all the
other judges, is black.
   The racial issue clearly troubles Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal
justice, which will resume its impeachment hearings on Tuesday.
   Conyers, who also is black, complained at the very start of the
hearings last week that the Hastings case was ``exceedingly
difficult and trying,'' partly because of suggestions that the
charges against Florida's first black federal judge were racially
and politically motivated.
   Other panel members seemed equally distressed. Liberal Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., called it an ``unwelcome'' duty. Rep. Hamilton
Fish, R-N.Y., said, ``It is not a pleasant responsibility to judge
a federal judge.''
   ``Frankly I don't want to be here this morning,'' said Rep. Mike
Synar, D-Okla., ``and I'm sure the judge doesn't either.''
   In an emotional opening statement delivered under oath, Hastings
intensified the panel's discomfort by reminding them that a trial
jury had acquitted him five years ago of conspiring to solicit a
$150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers.
   ``I am not guilty, but I am not free,'' Hastings shouted,
demanding that his judges in the House ``set me free.''
   The subcommittee is looking into charges by a special five-judge
panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Hastings
actually committed the crime and tried to conceal his part in the
bribery scheme by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his
trial. The panel investigated the case for 3{ years.
   Conyers resurrected the racial issue when John Doar, chief
counsel for the appellate panel, outlined the massive evidence he
had uncovered _ some of it unavailable to the Miami trial jury _ to
support the subcommittee's charges of impeachable misconduct by
Hastings.
   Conyers repeatedly asked Doar whether overt or even
``subconscious racism'' played any part in Hastings' prosecution or
the subsequent investigation by his fellow judges.
   ``Absolutely not,'' replied Doar, the respected former assistant
U.S. attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil
rights division during the Johnson administration.
   Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., declared there had ``never been a
hint'' that any part of the House panel's own year-long inquiry had
been racially motivated.
   Conyers also evoked the specter of political intrigue when he
charged that the federal judiciary had become ``conservatized and
in some instances politicized'' under the Reagan administration.
   Though prosecutors failed to make their case against Hastings,
they did against his alleged co-conspirator, Washington lawyer
William A. Borders, who was convicted in 1982 of arranging the
bribe and was sentenced to five years in prison.
   Terence Anderson of Miami, Hastings' chief counsel, said
prosecutors also succeeded in their aim of forcing Hastings, after
Borders' arrest, to remove himself from presiding over two major
court cases in Miami involving organized crime figures and Haitian
refugees, both of high-level interest in the Justice Department.
   The political motivation behind Hastings' prosecution, Anderson
said, ``is a lingering issue that they (the House panel) are not
looking at, and won't if they can avoid it.''
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell refused comment on
Anderson's allegation.
   The House subcommittee has subpoened Borders in the hope of
obtaining his crucial testimony, especially about whether Hastings
was ever aware that his close friend was arranging a bribe for him.
   Borders has refused to testify against Hastings at either of
their separate trials, nor did he ever appear before the judicial
investigative panel.

<HEAD>Koalas May Be Extinct In 10 Years Without Research, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban expansion and a terminal disease
could wipe out Australia's koala bears within 10 years, a leading
veterinarian said Sunday.
   Dr. Steve Brown, director of the World Koala Research Corp.,
said $3.5 million in research money was needed to help save the
marsupials from extinction.
   Half of Australia's 200,000 to 400,000 koalas are suffering from
chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease that causes blindness and
infertility, Brown said at a news conference.
   About 80 percent of their natural habitat has been destroyed,
and more is planned for conversion to farmland, he said.
   Brown said little is known about the biology, ecology and health
of koalas because little research has been done on them.
   Scientists don't even know what constitutes an ideal environment
for koalas or how many species of leaves they eat, he said.
   ``Scientists have the laboratories, the expertise and the staff
to solve these questions, but no money,'' he said.
   ``Australians are so apathetic about their unique animals they
don't even know they have already lost 17 native mammal species. I
don't think they even know there's 25 on an endangered list,'' he
said. ``We have plundered this country, its animals and its
environment.''

   More than 60 people died in a rainstorm
that raged for 21 hours in the southern coastal province of Fujian,
a provincial official said Sunday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported that 162 were injured
in the storm, which started Friday at 7 p.m. and lasted until 4
p.m. Saturday.
   Three hundred homes were destroyed, 120 bridges washed out and
1,976 acres of rice fields were flooded, the report said.
   Fujian Deputy Governor Yu Dexin said Governor Wang Zhaoguo was
at the scene leading rescue operations and that land transportation
to the province's northern county of Jiangyang had been halted.
   Rainfall near the town of Wufu in Jianyang county reached 12.16
inches, making all roads impassable, the agency said.
   The storm was the latest bad weather that has plagued China this
spring.
   Hailstorms swept through the central and coastal provinces
earlier this month, killing at least 24 people and injuring more
than 250.
   A tornado in southern China's Guangdong province killed five
people in early May.
   Also this month, parts of northern and central China were hit by
heavy rains after severe droughts that in some places lasted more
than 20 months.

<HEAD>Nashville Group Brings Down-home Music to Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The turbaned teen-agers in the back rows
clapped with the beat. Their heads, bodies and sandaled feet moved
energetically to the American music that few, if any, ever had
heard before.
   The down-home sounds of the Nashville Bluegrass Band were an
unusual experience for the blind Arab students, special guests at a
benefit concert for Bahrain's Al Noor Institute for the Blind.
   In performances Thursday through Sunday, the five-member group
introduced an eclectic form of Americana to a new Middle East
audience as part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by the
U.S. Information Service.
   ``The lyrical content may not get across, but the rhythms and
beats, and what's going on up on stage with the musicians, will be
picked up and enjoyed by the people,'' said banjo player Alan
O'Bryant.
   O'Bryant, of Reidsville, N.C., believes music works as an
ambassadorial tool because it ``can communicate with people in ways
mere words cannot.''
   At a Friday evening show at a local amusement park, Bahraini men
in ankle-length robes, or dishdashas, broke into traditional Arab
dancing that went on until dark, when ``we couldn't even see our
instruments any more,'' said guitarist and lead singer Pat Enright,
of Huntington, Ind.
   ``Everybody was trying to outdo everybody else. One guy walked
into the circle, did a complete back flip and walked out again. It
was definitely the highlight of our visit,'' he said.
   Although many Arabs prefer traditional music, Western music is
popular among the young.
   The audience is more limited for such specialized music as
bluegrass, whose deep roots are said to lie in music taken to
America by Scottish and Irish immigrants.
   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said bluegrass was chosen for this year's U.S.-sponsored ``Arts
America'' program so people could experience music that ``shows the
depth and breadth of America.''
   Last year's program in the Middle East featured break dancing.
   A handful of other country-bluegrass bands have visited the
region in the past decade but appeared mostly at hotels catering to
foreigners.
   U.S. embassies work with government officials to make sure
performers and material are suitable for local audiences.
   In Islamic countries, there's no place for gospel music with
strong religious themes. In some, such as Saudi Arabia, males and
females do not appear together.
   The all-male Nashville band, which also includes mandolin player
Mike Compton, fiddler Stuart Duncan and bassist Mark Hembree, also
scheduled stops in Qatar, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq and Egypt.
   But it may take a few more tours before ``My Native Home'' finds
a home on Arab radio station playlists.
   ``Yes, I've heard this music before,'' a youth at the amusement
park told a reporter. ``It's from Hawaii, no?''

   Commencement exercises at Iowa State
University were anything but ordinary for Julie Quinn.
   Paul Maass, senior class president, was making the traditional
announcement of the class gift to the university Saturday when he
made another announcement _ a proposal of marriage to Ms. Quinn.
   ``It definitely shocked the whole crowd,'' said Maass, 22, a
graduate in agricultural economics from Paullina.
   Ames' Hilton Coliseum was nearly packed, ``and the first thing I
heard was this sigh across the crowd,'' he said. ``I said, `Please
stand and wave if you'll marry me.'''
   Ms. Quinn, 22, an Iowa City native who has two more years of
studying special education, was sitting in the audience and heard
the marriage proposal but didn't hear the part about standing.
   ``Then I figured it out and I waved my hand and shook my head
yes. ... I waved hard,'' Ms. Quinn said. ``I just saw everybody
staring at me.''
   Ms. Quinn now must decide if she's going to finish at Iowa State
or move to Omaha, Neb., where Maass has landed a job.
   ``We don't know. We haven't had time to talk about this at
all,'' she said. ``I was 100 percent shocked.''

   Working as if someone had punched their
fast-forward button, framers, electricians, painters, roofers and
other builders put up a house in less than nine hours.
   More than 400 people, including suppliers, helped build the
single-story, three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in eight hours and
54 minutes Saturday to kick off the Boise Parade of Homes.
   A gunshot at 8 a.m. gave the signal for members of the Building
Contractors Association of Southwest Idaho to start.
   Since the cement foundation had been installed earlier in the
week, the framers went to work like they were at an old-fashioned
barn-raising, hoisting wooden walls.
   Spectators had their own viewing stand across the street. They
were able to tell who was who by workers' color-coded T-shirts.
Framers sported fuchsia; electricians, lime green.
   One spectator, Marion Stevenson of Boise, said the coordination
of the workers astounded him.
   ``I only saw one worker just about get hit,'' Stevenson said.
   Also watching the process were the buyers of the house _ Brad
Chapple and his fiancee, Leslie Cozza, who plan to move in June 6.
They paid $68,000 for the house.
   Chapple said they were getting a 10-year warranty with the home,
instead of the usual one-year warranty.
   Chapple admitted he was a nervous first-time homeowner. ``It's
been a heavy stress factor,'' he said of the planning and
coordination.

   The Tennessee Legislature has quietly
reeled in two more official state creatures.
   Without the ado that might muddy the water, the lawmakers have
approved resolutions so far in 1988 to name the catfish as the
official Tennessee Commercial Fish and the largemouth bass as the
official Tennessee Game Fish.
   They join the passion flower as the state wildflower, the iris
as its cultivated flower, the mockingbird as the official bird, the
tulip poplar as the state tree, and the raccoon as Tennessee's wild
animal.
   There's also the firefly and the lady bug, which jointly reign
as the state's insects thanks to a political compromise. And
perhaps thinking of their own words, lawmakers designated the pearl
as the state gem.
   Two separate legislative sessions designated pet rocks _ in
1969, agate got the nod, but in 1979, it was limestone.
   But there's still no state vegetable: a 1979 proposal to give
the honor to corn was killed by a heavily Democratic Agriculture
Committee with the explanation that corn is a legume, not a
vegetable, according to its sponsor, former Republican House member
Dale Kelley.

<HEAD>Republicans Lack Name Candidate To Battle Moynihan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who
plans to announce Monday that he'll seek a third term, has
Republican leaders worried that he could win by a large enough
margin to damage GOP chances of carrying the state in the
presidential race.
   At the moment, the likely Republican challenger for the two-term
senator is Robert McMillan, a little-known Long Island lawyer.
   ``This, at best, is going to be a tough state for (Vice
President George) Bush and the few percentage points that Moynihan
might skew the election or that (Republican Robert) McMillan might
skew the election are important enough for them to go after,'' said
Buffalo's Victor Farley, the Erie County GOP chairman.
   ``I don't know that it'll be a major factor, but it'll have an
impact,'' said Richard Rosenbaum, a former state chairman and a
Republican national committeeman, of the possible effect of the
Senate race on the presidential contest in New York.
   John Marino, executive director of the state Democratic
Committee and a political operative of Gov. Mario Cuomo, calls the
Moynihan situation a ``reverse coattail effect.''
   ``In a close race at the top, it'll make a difference if
Moynihan can win by a two-to-one margin and that's why Jonathan
Bush got involved in trying to find an opponent,'' said Marino.
   Jonathan Bush, the vice president's brother and a top Republican
fund-raiser in New York, has been encouraging McMillan, 55, to run.
McMillan is expected to announce his candidacy early next month.
   What has Republicans worried is that without a strong challenge
to Moynihan, some potential GOP voters may simply stay home in
November and thus deny Bush needed votes in a close race.
   Initially, Republicans had expected to have a celebrity
candidate. There was speculation that former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger might be interested. He wasn't. Rudolph
Giuliani, the New York City-based federal prosecutor who had made a
name for himself convicting Mafia chieftains and corrupt
politicians, kept Republican leaders hanging for months before
finally bowing out earlier this year.
   ``I think he's vulnerable,'' Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., said of
Moynihan, ``but there's no one in the Giuliani or Kissinger class''
to run.
   Kemp, after his bid for the GOP presidential nomination
collapsed this spring, was mentioned as a possible Moynihan
opponent.
   ``I thought it was too late for me to shift gears,'' Kemp said
of his decision not to run.
   State Comptroller Edward Regan, a proven strong draw for
Republicans, said he viewed the U.S. Senate as ``a demotion'' when
he declined.
   Former U.S. Ambassador to Austria Ronald Lauder, son of
cosmetics magnate Estee Lauder, said he wanted to spend time with
his family.
   Farley said some of the potential big-name candidates were
scared off by the money needed for the race and Moynihan's apparent
strength with the New York electorate.
   ``Big names have big egos,'' said Farley. ``Big egos don't want
to be deflated. And since they don't want to be deflated, they're
looking for a sure thing. So you only get someone who wants to move
up.''
   ``You give me a weak incumbent and you'll find plenty of
Republicans,'' Cuomo said.
   Of those New Yorkers polled in January by the Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion, more than 57 percent said Moynihan
had done a good or excellent job and 45 percent said they
``definitely plan to vote for him.''
   Already, Moynihan has raised more than $3.6 million for his
re-election campaign and spent about $2 million. He's expected to
easily raise several million more.
   Republican leaders are assuring McMillan they can raise the $3
million he said he needs for the race, but the GOP has had
difficulty in raising big money for candidates since the late Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller left office in late 1973 to become vice
president under Gerald Ford.

   A container ship ran across the bow of a tugboat
near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on Sunday, dumping the tug's crew
of five into the water and sending the vessel to the bottom,
authorities said.
   The crewmen were pulled quickly from the chilly water by workers
on a nearby tug that rushed to the scene.
   One victim had a broken ankle and another suffered a head injury
in the collision, according to Coast Guard Warrant Officer Fred
Schlager. No other serious injuries were reported.
   The 110-foot tug Elizabeth Moran was pushing a cement barge
through the harbor when it was hit by the Figaroa, a 650-foot car
carrier en route to Port Elizabeth in New Jersey, the Coast Guard
said.
   Visibility was very low in the area of the bridge, which
connects Brooklyn and Staten Island, authorities said.

   Iran said Sunday it was carrying out
major military maneuvers involving warplanes and more than 50 ships
in the Persian Gulf and waters just outside.
   Tehran radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., said
``helicopters, air force fighter planes and the airborne brigade of
the army'' also were participating in the exercises.
   The report appeared to indicate that virtually all of Iran's
biggest naval vessels were involved in the exercises _ codenamed
``Zolfaqar'' _ in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean.
   The radio quoted a Capt. Shirazi, whom it identified as ``naval
commander in Chabahar,'' as saying in an interview that
``missile-carrying destroyers, heavy destroyers, missile-launching
frigates and personnel carriers would be taking part in the
maneuvers.''
   The Iranians lost six naval vessels in a major clash with the
U.S. Navy on April 18.
   Iran announced more than a week ago that it was planning to
stage naval exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the
gulf, to show that it remained a major power in the area.
   Gulf shipping officials and U.S. intelligence sources at the
Pentagon in Washington recently reported an increase in the numbers
and activities of Iran's fleet of small armed speedboats around the
Bandar Abbas naval base in the Strait of Hormuz.
   Since the battle with U.S. forces, Iranian Revolutionary Guards
have carried out three known speedboat attacks on neutral ships in
the strait _ one on April 24 and two last week.
   Iranian patrol boats also have been intercepting vessels passing
through the Hormuz strait to check for cargoes bound for Iraq, its
foe in a nearly 8-year-old war.
   A war communique quoted by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency did not mention naval maneuvers but said Iranian air force
planes flew ``routine patrol missions'' over the Persian Gulf and
Gulf of Oman ``in support of the navy, reconnoitering 21 vessels in
the waterway.''
   In the April 18 fighting, the 1,540-ton frigate Sahand was sunk
and a sister ship, the Sabalan, was disabled. Other losses included
a Kaman-class patrol boat, sunk after it fired a missile at a U.S.
warship and missed, and three speedboats.
   Iran said 44 of its men were killed in the clashes, triggered by
U.S. attacks that destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in the south
central gulf. The United States said those attacks were in reprisal
for Iranian mining of gulf waters.
   U.S. officials say that despite the setbacks, Iran remains a
potent naval force whose threats of revenge for the April 18 losses
cannot be taken lightly.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said during a military awards ceremony May 5 that the Iranians
``have a considerable capability and they have standoff missile
capability, which we are always concerned about.''
   H2an's navy includes two former U.S. destroyers, a British
destroyer and two corvettes _ all of World War II vintage _ and
three supply ships, two of which are sometimes used for naval
patrol operations in the southern gulf.
   The destroyers and corvettes have not been sighted in recent
months and their operational status is unclear, U.S. officers say.
   Iran also has 10 fast-attack patrol craft like the one sunk on
April 18 and perhaps 100 speedboats equipped with a variety of
weapons including recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns, heavy
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

<HEAD>Dukakis Doesn't Exude Excitement, But Has His Own Style</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   While most politicians crave seeing their
faces on the television news or reading their names in newspapers,
Michael Dukakis often acts indifferent to that aspect of
campaigning.
   As the Democratic presidential front-runner campaigned through
critically important California, he repeatedly passed up easy
chances to add to George Bush's discomfort over the
administration's handling of Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``I'm going to do everything I can to stay positive,'' he said
when asked on his campaign plane why he had avoided direct
criticism of the man certain to be his Republican opponent in the
fall.
   Dukakis' fierce determination to do it his way distinguishes his
campaign from those of any other presidential candidates _ this or
any other campaign year.
   And while the Dukakis style may seem odd to observers accustomed
to traditional campaigns, no one can argue with its success.
   In just over two weeks, when the last four Democratic primaries
are held June 7, Dukakis is certain to collect enough delegates to
give him more than the 2,081 needed to clinch his party's
presidential nomination.
   As the primary season progressed, Dukakis often was criticized
as dull and passionless, a speaker with all the impact of sodium
pentathol.
   But out of the initially large Democratic field, only Jesse
Jackson remains to challenge him.
   One thing the Massachusetts governor may have in common with a
select number of past presidential candidates is the ability to
represent what many voters are looking for.
   In 1960, John F. Kennedy excited voters because he represented
generational change. In 1976, Jimmy Carter campaigned as an
outsider in a year voters were fed up with the Washington insiders
who'd brought them Vietnam and Watergate.
   Dukakis exudes hands-on competence at a time when opinion polls
suggest Americans are looking for a change from the hands-off style
of President Reagan.
   Sometimes Dukakis goes out of his way to stay out of sight of
the media.
   ``He runs around closing events that we scheduled as open,''
said campaign adviser Anthony Podesta.
   The candidate often speaks at schools and when he does he meets
privately before his speech with a group of students.
   He said he started doing that a few years ago when he became
concerned about the extent of drug and alcohol abuse in schools.
   ``I'd go into a school and people would say we've got a great
program,'' he said.
   ``I finally said, look, before I do these assemblies, I'd like
to meet with a cross-section of the kids, 25 or 30, just me, no
adults, no teachers.''
   At those sessions, he said, he got a much more accurate picture
of what was happening in the schools.
   Would he continue holding such meetings as president?
   ``I expect to,'' he said.
   Dukakis attacks the administration for its handling of the
Noriega affair, while avoiding direct personal attacks.
   With the tone of an outraged manager, Dukakis demanded ``an
explanation'' of why the administration was ``doing business with
Noriega.''
   ``We won't be doing business with drug-peddling Panamanian
dictators,'' is a stock line in the Dukakis stump speech.
   But when he was asked to comment on the latest reports of a
pending deal that would have Noriega relinquish power in exchange
for the United States dropping drug charges against him, Dukakis
would only say, ``I don't know anything about it.''
   When asked about reports that Bush was separating himself from
Reagan on the question of negotiations with Noriega, Dukakis
refused to take a shot at the vice president.
   Talking later about his determination to wage a positive
campaign, he said, ``The Bush campaign went negative for three
weeks and all it did was hurt them.''
   He is convinced that ``the American peoplke are fed up with
that. They don't want to know what he thinks of me or I think of
him.
   ``They want to know which one of us has the stuff to do this job
and what we're for and that's what I'm going to do.''
   But Dukakis also passes up one of the most time-tested ways
candidates get across to voters what they stand for and what they
would do as president.
   One of the most common occurences on the campaign of a
challenger to an incumbent administration is for that candidate to
approach reporters, often the first thing in the morning, and offer
his views on the biggest news of the day.
   But not on the Dukakis campaign. Rarely does he vary from his
carefully structured appearances.

   Singer-songwriter Carole King says timber
companies are asking for a kind of welfare and she doesn't want to
see them get it.
   King, also a wilderness advocate, says timber companies want to
harvest more trees in Idaho but need the U.S. Forest Service to
build roads, at taxpayers' expense, to get to them.
   The cost of building the roads in many cases is greater than the
money the Forest Service collects for the trees, King told about
100 people attending the Idaho Conservation League annual meeting
Friday. She also sang a few songs, accompanying herself on the
guitar.
   While she urges setting aside land for the public, King had her
own tussle with the Forest Service and Custer County over access to
property in the county, where she lives.
   When she bought Robinson Bar Ranch, she locked a gate on a road
through her property and contended that her rights were violated
when the county declared the road public. The Forest Service
claimed the closure blocked public access to public lands.
   The Idaho Supreme Court ruled Feb. 10 that the property belongs
to King and her husband, Rick Sorensen, and there is no public
access involved.
   ``I protected my rights and now I am working to protect
everyone's rights,'' King said.

   Willie Nelson says he never wanted to get
involved with politics prior to his involvement in the first Farm
Aid concert.
   The country music star thought he was playing ``just another
charity show'' when he helped Neil Young and John Mellencamp
organize the benefit performance on behalf of financially strapped
farmers.
   Instead, Farm Aid has become a 4-year-old effort that has led
Nelson to become politically active and has required that he spend
much more time than he anticipated trying to help the family farmer.
   ``I'll be honest with you. I never really wanted to get involved
with politics. I always felt that was something the other guy
should do and I should sit on the side and criticize,'' Nelson
said. ``But when I got into Farm Aid and into the farm situation,
it wasn't possible for me to say `I don't want to do anything'
anymore.''
   For the past three years, Nelson has rounded up his friends to
play a giant concert to benefit family farmers. Those three
concerts raised more than $10 million for farmers. But no such
concert will be held in 1988, and Nelson said it is unlikely there
will ever be another Farm Aid show.
   ``I never say `never,' but right now it's time for the
politicians to do their share,'' he said.

   Frances ``Tut'' Woodruff, known for a court
battle for her share of the Coca-Cola fortune and her passion for
hang gliding, has started an ambulance service.
   The 64-year-old heiress was attending a Rabun County Commission
meeting when a woman complained the publicly subsidized ambulance
service wouldn't take her husband from a Clayton hospital to one
outside the county.
   Commissioners said the service had a policy against leaving the
county.
   ``I was very hurt that this lady couldn't get help from the
county,'' Miss Woodruff said.
   That prompted the birth of the Blue Ridge Emergency Service this
month. Miss Woodruff quickly hired all the emergency medical
technicians away from the public service, and that service has been
discontinued.
   ``We're glad she took it,'' said Claude Kelly, chairman of the
Rabun County Hospital Authority. ``She stole a headache from us.
It'll save the taxpayers $70,000 a year.''
   Kelly said he has no resentment toward Miss Woodruff, but added
that ``when she gets tired of playing with it and losing two or
three hundred thousand dollars a year and is ready to get rid of
it, then we'll start ours back again.''

   ``In life there are some people you meet whom
you'd just like to pal around with. They're fun, they put you in a
good frame of mind, and they make you feel terrific,'' Lee Iacocca
writes in his new book ``Talking Straight.''
   ``Well, that's Ronald Reagan. He's not Dr. Strangelove _ He's
Dr. Feelgood. I want him to be my pal. But not my president.''
   The book, due out in June, is excerpted in the May 30 issue of
People magazine. The Chrysler Corp. chairman's previous book,
``Iacocca,'' sold 2.6 million copies.
   The new book covers more recent events in his life and politics.
Iacocca talks about the 1983 death of his wife of 27 years, his
short-lived second marriage, his struggles with Don Regan while
Regan was treasury secretary and his predictions for the 1988
presidential race.
   Iacocca says he thought of running for the country's top spot
himself, but decided against it.
   So who does Iacocca expect to occupy the White House?
   ``The odds are overpowering that we're going to have a very
activist Democratic president. I don't think the Republicans can
make it.''

   A firebomb apparently aimed
at Israeli soldiers hit an Arab car Sunday and killed a Palestinian
woman and her son. A third Arab died of gunshot wounds suffered
during a clash with Israeli troops.
   In a weekend of scattered clashes, three Arab teen-agers were
wounded by army gunfire, and an Israeli man was seriously burned
and his pet dog killed in a firebombing, hospital and military
officials said.
   Israeli officials reopened schools Sunday that were shut for
nearly four months in east Jerusalem because of the Arab uprising
that began Dec. 8.
   Shamseh Al Kadah, 65, and her son Mohammed Salah Ghanem, 36,
died when their car blew up at the entrance to Shuweika, a village
of 1,500 Palestinians about 65 miles northwest of Jerusalem,
hospital officials and witnesses said.
   Arab villagers and military sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a firebomb appeared to have been aimed at an
Israeli army jeep traveling in front of the Palestinian-owned
automobile.
   Israel radio and an official at Israel's Abu Kabir Pathological
Institute, where the bodies were taken for autopsies, reported the
early morning explosion was caused by a firebomb. The official
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The army said it was investigating and declined further comment.
   Black ashes were scattered 15 yards from the site of the
explosion.
   Villagers in Shuweika said the incident occurred after soldiers
detained Arab men and boys in a schoolyard to check identity cards.
   The army confirmed the death Sunday of a 23-year-old Arab woman,
Kawther Miri. She was shot in the chest during a clash between Arab
protesters and Israeli troops Saturday at a refugee camp in nearby
Tulkarem. The army said it was investigating.
   Soldiers clamped a curfew on the camp, an army spokesman said.
   The fatalities brought the Palestinian death toll to 194 since
the Arab uprising began. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli
teen-ager have been killed.
   In other weekend clashes, an Israeli man, Yaacov Askayo of
Jerusalem, suffered serious burns when his car was hit by a
firebomb as he drove through the West Bank city of Jericho, the
army said.
   Violence also broke out in the West Bank's largest city of
Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem. Soldiers shot and wounded two
19-year-old Arabs after hundreds of protesters pelted troops with
stones on an avenue recently renamed for slain PLO leader Khalil
Wazir, said officials at Al Ittihad Hospital.
   Israel has been blamed by Palestinians for the April 16
assassination of Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, who was gunned
down at his home in a Tunis suburb.
   Two youths were hit by rubber bullets in the Nablus incident,
the army said. Another three were treated for beating injuries,
according to hospital officials.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers clashed Saturday night with
protesters at the Deir el Balah refugee camp, wounding an
18-year-old in the right leg, officials at Gaza City's Ahli Arab
Hospital said.
   Arab news reports said the camp was placed under curfew after
the incident.
   Israel radio said up to 80 percent attendance was reported among
Jerusalem's 16,000 Arab elementary and high school pupils, who
normally attend classes Sunday.
   Witnesses said students burned tires and threw bottles at
Israeli soldiers outside two schools in Jerusalem's walled Old
City, but there were no reported injuries.
   The pupils will have to give up part of their summer vacation
and attend classes an extra day a week to make up for lost time,
municipal officials said.
   The army said it would reopen schools in the West Bank Monday.

<HEAD>Pandas' Trip Tempered By Legal Woes</HEAD>

   Legal wrangling threatens to prevent a pair
of giant pandas from being put on public display, despite the
excitement the bearlike creatures have stirred up here.
   ``Yes, we wish there wasn't so much controversy surrounding
their visit. But they are here now, and hopefully we can put this
all behind us soon,'' Toledo Zoo spokeswoman Betsy Clark said.
   Although the zoo hopes to start exhibiting Le Le and Nan Nan on
Tuesday, it still must clear at least two hurdles before showing
the pandas, of which fewer than 1,000 are thought to exist.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which said the animals
entered the United States without proper documentation, has given
the zoo until Saturday to correct the problem, Wildlife Service
spokesman David Klinger said.
   The pandas will not be displayed until the paper work is in
order, and, if the matter is not cleared up, Le Le and Nan Nan will
be sent back to China, he said.
   Zoo officials said they have a representative in China trying to
clear up the problem.
   At the same time, the World Wildlife Fund and the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums are trying to stop
the zoo's display with a federal lawsuit.
   The groups contend that exhibition of the pandas violates the
international convention that prohibits trafficking in endangered
species for commercial purposes. The Toledo Zoo has filed a
countersuit, charging harassment.
   Still, some zoo officials are trying not to let the legal
hassles put a damper on their panda plans. ``It still is very
exciting. I just wish we could show the public how cute they are,''
Ms. Clark said.
   Indeed, this city of 340,000 along the banks of the Maumee River
in northwest Ohio has seemingly caught panda mania.
   Stores in downtown Toledo are stocked with panda souvenirs such
as T-shirts with pandas saying, `Meet Me In Toledo,' and hats and
drinking cups with pandas emblazoned on them. Grocery and
department stores are offering panda sales, and panda flags fly
from houses in some neighborhoods.
   China gave two pandas to the National Zoo in Washington in the
early 1970s. But China has only lent pandas to a few other zoos in
the United States, none as small as Toledo.
   The Wildlife Fund has questioned China's use of fees it charges
for panda loans. It also has been pressuring the Wildlife Service,
part of the U.S. Interior Department, to stop what it calls China's
rent-a-panda policy until China can prove it is using those fees to
preserve its pandas.
   Edwin Bergsmark, president of the Toledo Zoological Society and
the driving force behind the panda loan, said the Chinese have
taken great offense at the Wildlife Fund's implicit criticism and
condemnation of Chinese conservation efforts.
   But Wildlife Fund spokesman Kenneth Cook said the animals are
being displayed for profit. He said the exhibition would increase
the demand for such transactions from other zoos and hurt the
effort to breed pandas.
   Toledo expects attendance to double this summer to about 10,000
people a day during the animals' stay.
   Zoo officials spent nearly $3 million preparing for the pandas'
visit and gave the Chinese about $300,000 in equipment and
technical help in exchange for the panda loan.
   Pandas are the national symbol of China and long have been
regarded by the Chinese as the ultimate gesture of goodwill and
friendship.

<TEXT>
   The last Soviet troops on Sunday pulled out of
Jalalabad and arrived in the capital, Kabul, the Tass news agency
reported.
   The withdrawal paved the way for a rebel attack on Jalalabad, a
strategic northeastern city. Anti-communist forces have said they
would invade Jalalabad once the Soviet troops were gone.
   Tass said withdrawal of the convoy left no Soviet troops in the
province of Nangarhar, in northeast Afghanistan near the border
with Pakistan.
   The brief dispatch did not say how many troops were in the
convoy, the latest in a series to make the 88-mile trip to Kabul
from Jalalabad.
   The convoy will rest in the capital before traveling an
additional 200 miles to the Soviet city of Termez.
   The first convoy headed out from Jalalabad on May 15 and was
greeted in Kabul with marching bands and speeches by Afghan
officials, including President Najib.
   On Saturday, Tass said, a second military unit from Afghanistan
arrived in Termez and was welcomed by relatives and friends, city
officials and youth delegations from several Soviet republics.
   Under an agreement signed in Geneva on April 14, an estimated
115,000 Soviet soldiers who have been helping the Afghan government
in its war with anti-Marxist guerrillas are to be out within nine
months.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda on Sunday repeated what has
become daily Soviet media criticism of the United States and
Pakistan for continuing to supply weapons to the guerrillas who
have been fighting the Kabul government since a 1978 communist coup.
   ``The heart of the Geneva agreements, on which stand the
signatures of representatives of the U.S.A. and Pakistan, is simple
and understandable: the fate of Afghanistan should be decided by
the Afghan people themselves, and only themselves,'' Pravda said.
   The newspaper cited Western reports that the Afghan rebels are
feverishly shipping military equipment from bases in Pakistan to
facilities in Afghanistan.
   It said ``several hotheads'' in Washington are discussing how
the rebels will take control of Afghan cities and form a
provisional government. But the rebels are not as strong as some
people in the West think, Pravda said, and the predictions of
victory are overly optimistic.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced
one pro-Kremlin government with another and remained to fight the
insurgency.

   Secretary of State George Shultz, saying it's
``time to decide,'' urged the Senate on Sunday to approve the
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles in time
for the summit between Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   The secretary of state also echoed the positive remarks
Gorbachev made in an interview with U.S. reporters, in which the
Soviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing in
half the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons before
Reagan leaves office.
   ``It's certainly possible,'' Shultz said of prospects for such a
treaty. Speaking on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' the
secretary added: ``And I feel certain that at the Moscow summit we
will both want to agree to keep working on it hard. But whether it
will actually happen or not, I don't know. The issues are tough.''
   The president leaves Wednesday, stopping first in Helsinki,
Finland, before traveling on to Moscow for the May 29-June 2 summit.
   Queried about talks on the disputed Strategic Defense
Initiative, which has hampered agreement on a strategic missile
pact, Shultz said Reagan has staunchly opposed any impediment to
the development of a defense against ballistic missiles.
   ``That still leaves room for a lot of things,'' the secretary
said, pointing to a ``period of non-withdrawal'' from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which the Soviets contend bars
certain elements of the president's space-based missile defense
program, also known as Star Wars.
   On Saturday, Reagan used his radio address to appeal for
ratification of the medium-range missile treaty, formally known as
the pact on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces.
   It was signed by the two leaders at their December summit in
Washington and administration officials are eager to display the
ratified treaty as a boost for the president in his negotiations
with Gorbachev.
   While the Senate has turned aside a wave of amendments designed
by its conservative opponents to kill the treaty, debate is
expected to continue through much of the week. Approval of the pact
requires 67 votes, if all 100 senators are present.
   Shultz, who is to carry his campaign for the pact to Capitol
Hill on Monday, pointed out that more than a dozen years have
passed since the United States has ratified a treaty with the
Soviet Union, and that it would help the president in his efforts
at the summit if the treaty were approved.
   ``It helps certainly to have completed something and to register
that fact. ... It's good to register the fact that we can do it,''
Shultz said.
   The secretary, avoiding any criticism of the president's
conservative allies who oppose the treaty, lauded the Senate for
its thorough consideration of the pact.
   ``I think the process has gone well. I have only compliments for
the Senate and the way in which they've handled this,'' he said,
adding, ``I think there's been a time for hearings, a time for
questions, a time for critiques and a time for debate. There also
has to come a time to decide and I think we're about there.''
   Appearing on the same program, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, said he believed the treaty will be
ready in time for the two leaders to sign.
   ``We will finish the INF treaty, prior not to the president
departing, but prior to the actual meetings,'' he said, adding,
``That's a guess and I give it 60-40 odds.''
   Senate Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he's counted some 78
``very firm'' votes for the treaty. ``I don't think the president
should go empty-handed,'' said Cranston, appearing on NBC-TV's
``Meet The Press.''
   On the same show, treaty opponent Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
called the pact ``very one-sided and very, very dangerous,'' and
one that would allow the Soviets an unfair advantage.
   The spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Gennady
Gerasimov, said on the same show that U.S. officials had predicted
at the December summit that the treaty would be ratified by April.
   ``And now it is May. We simply expect, that if you promise then
you must deliver. But we also understand your political system,''
Gerasimov said.
   He said it would be considered ``a good sign of your willingness
to improve relations between our countries if you ratify the treaty
by the time of the Moscow summit.''

   A Zimbabwe newspaper said Sunday that
black extras in a U.S.-produced anti-apartheid movie are angry
because a dog was paid more than they were during filming.
   The state-owned Sunday Mail reported that the dog was earning
twice the $15 a day black extras were paid. In Zimbabwe, the
minimum monthly wage is $54 dollars.
   ``Personally, I am shocked that animals can earn more than
humans,'' said Lucas Tavaya, a Zimbabwe information department
official.
   But a spokeswoman for the information department said everyone
in the production of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ``A Dry White Season,''
including the extras, received fair pay.
   ``The allegations are a pack of mischievous lies,'' said
Beverley Tilley, a Zimbabwean who coordinates film making for the
information department.
   ``The dog was hired from a professional dog-handler and trainer,
and it does earn more than extras _ both black and white,'' she
told The Associated Press. ``But there are some black Zimbabweans
in the technical crew earning up to $4,000 a month.''
   MGM representatives have refused to discuss the row over the
animal.
   The film stars Marlon Brando and is based on a book by South
African novelist Andre Brink. It focuses on the subject of
apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation in which the
black majority has no voice in national affairs.
   Ms. Tilley told the newspaper she feared that because the movie
was about apartheid, ``the South Africans could be manipulating
someone who in turn was responsible for alleged problems at the
shooting of `A Dry White Season.' ''
   The Mail, quoting a spokesman for the black extras, who were not
identified, said: ``The amount the dog is earning is too much to
maintain an animal. It ... has taken part in a few of the episodes.
This is an ironic case of an organization seeking to expose
apartheid.''
   The extras also said they wanted the government to appoint more
blacks to key positions in the information department, which
coordinates film making in this country.
   Ms. Tilley told the AP that complaints over extras' pay rates
had been raised in previous films shot in Zimbabwe, and she said
similar bad publicity could hurt the country's efforts to attract
international film makers.

   A strong earthquake Sunday hit the western
island of Cephalonia and triggered a landslide, but that didn't
surprise Greek scientists. They said they predicted the quake the
night before.
   There were no reports of casualties or building damage, but the
quake ``shook everybody awake this morning'' said a police officer
on the island.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake registered 5.5
on the Richter scale and hit at 6:44 a.m. It was the second strong
quake to hit the island in five days.
   The Seismological Institute said Sunday's tremor was centered
about 187 miles west of the capital, in the Ionian seabed close to
Cephalonia.
   On Saturday night, Athens University scientists monitoring the
earth's electrical field predicted the quake.
   Professor Panayotis Varotsos, a physicist who developed the
seismic prediction method in the early 1980s, said it was ``the
second time in a week the system worked with real accuracy.''
   ``We sent a telegram to the co-ministerial committee on
earthquakes last night that predicted the timing, strength and
location of today's earthquake,'' Varotsos said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   Officials on the committee could not be immediately reached for
comment.
   Varotsos' telegram, timed at 8:30 p.m. Saturday, predicted a 5.3
quake with an epicenter identical to that of the real quake.
   ``We said the quake was an aftershock to last Wednesday's
earthquake and would therefore occur within seven hours,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, a tremor measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale shook
Cephalonia and parts of western Greece, cracking village houses in
the Aetolia-Acharnania province on the mainland. There were no
reports of injuries.
   Varotsos' monitoring team had predicted Wednesday's quake three
days earlier in a similar telegram to the committee, which helps
fund his research.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake
through the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a
``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   On Cephalonia, a police officer said Sunday's quake triggered a
landslide that blocked a road near the island's main town of
Argostoli.
   The police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
there were no reports of casualties or cracked buildings on the
island.
   Structures on quake-prone Cephalonia are built to resist
earthquakes of more than 7 on the Richter scale.
   In August 1953, a disastrous earthquake in the Ionian Islands
off western Greece killed more than 400 people and leveled more
than 25,000 houses on Cephalonia and the nearby islands of Ithaca
and Zakynthos.
   Since 1983, Varotsos and his team have operated 18 monitoring
stations on mainland Greece that track electrical impulses emitted
from the earth.
   ``This week's predictions were the most successful ever ...
experience is fine-tuning the method,'' he said.
   Using electrodes inserted six feet into the ground and an
amplifier linked to a microcomputer, the scientists keep a 24-hour
watch for variations in the earth's electric field that would
indicate an earthquake was building.
   ``Before an earthquake occurs, there are stresses in the ground
that cause emissions of different electrical signals,'' Varotsos
said.
   He said the time lag between changes in the electrical field
ranged from seven hours to one week, but that usually the quake
strikes within 45-60 hours.
   Varotsos said that by increasing the number of monitoring
stations ``to around 40, including some on the Aegean islands, it
should be possible to accurately predict every tremor in the region
over 5 Richter.''
   Varotsos said similar sensor networks have been installed in
Japan in a research program operated by Tokyo University
seismologists.
   He described the theoretical background to his earthquake
forecasting methods in a book published in the Netherlands in 1986
and in articles in an Amsterdam-based scientific journal,
Tectonophysics.

   Malcolm Forbes, the 68-year-old leader
of the pack, hugged actress Elizabeth Taylor, pulled on a red vest
sporting a ``capitalist tool'' logo and climbed onto his Harley
motorcycle Sunday to ride for charity.
   The thunder of engines pierced the dewy morning air at Forbes'
estate as the millionaire publisher's motorcycle club kicked into
action.
   He then roared down the driveway, leading 45 bikes to a rally in
Elysburg, Pa., to help raise funds for muscular dystrophy research.
   The scene recurs on Sundays from spring through fall at Forbes'
estate, Timberfield. But on Sunday, Forbes, who appeared on Outlaw
Biker's magazine May cover, was riding for charity.
   ``We do this every Sunday but this is a worthy cause,'' said
Forbes, as he prepared to leave on his 2{-hour dash. ``We're sorry
Elizabeth can't come. She's going to chopper down.''
   Miss Taylor had planned to accompany Forbes but couldn't be his
motorcycle mama because of recurrent back problems.
   ``This is the first time I haven't gone'' on a Sunday outing
this year, Miss Taylor said.
   Forbes has been a motorcycling enthusiast for 20 years. He
introduced Miss Taylor to the sport last year. Last fall, Forbes
gave her a custom-painted purple motorcycle and the two exchanged
biker rings.
   Miss Taylor rode in Forbes' private helicopter to the rally at
the Knoebels Amusement Resort, where hundreds of other bikers were
expected.
   Before leaving his estate, Forbes presented a $5,000 check to
Willie Davidson of Harley-Davidson, which is raising money for
muscular dystrophy research.
   The event was sponsored by the Eastern Harley-Davidson Dealers
Association, said Forbes' publicist, Donald Garson.
   Forbes is the publisher of Forbes magazine, a business
publication that bills itself a ``capitalist tool.''

<HEAD>Janos Kadar: From Stalinist To Reformer to Man of The Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hungary, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janos Kadar, replaced as Communist
Party leader Sunday after 32 years in power, emerged from a
discredited Stalinist regime to guide Hungary to relative
prosperity and a tolerance rare in the Soviet bloc.
   But Kadar's popularity at home and abroad faded in the 1980s as
Hungary's brand of Communism for the consumer ran into mounting
difficulties that fueled demands for political reform.
   Kadar, who turns 76 Thursday, resisted calls for his ouster for
at least two years prior his replacement by 57-year-old Karoly
Grosz.
   After World War II, Kadar was jailed and then freed by his
political peers during a purge of party ranks, but he took control
in 1956, when Hungary was stunned by the brutal quashing of an
anti-Soviet revolt.
   It was Kadar who urged Moscow to send in troops and tanks
against the rebels, and it was Kadar who presided over the
subsequent repression that culminated in the June 1958 execution of
Imre Nagy, the government head during the revolt.
   Within four months of Nagy's execution, Kadar found the formula
that helped him heal the wounds of 1956. He pledged to raise living
standards, and in the next 25 years presided over reforms that
fostered growing prosperity at home and won over Western nations
who refused to accept him as leader after 1956.
   The reversal typified his up-and-down career.
   Born in 1912 in what is now the Yugoslav port of Rijeka, Kadar
was raised by peasants until age 6, when his semi-literate mother
took him to Budapest.
   After eight years' school, Kadar became a worker, joining the
illegal Communist Party in 1931 and rising swiftly.
   By 1948, Kadar was deputy party leader and Interior Minister. It
has never been clear, however, whether he controlled brutal purges
of political and religious opponents at that time.
   Party leader Matyas Rakosi, a Stalinist, watched Kadar's rise
jealously. In 1951, Kadar was arrested and jailed on charges never
made public, winning freedom again only in 1954, when Rakosi's star
faded following the death of Soviet leader Josef Stalin in 1953.
   Kadar's topsy-turvy early career and the poverty of his
childhood likely taught him the necessity of compromise and of
trying to give citizens a good life.
   By 1968, Kadar had steered through a so-called new economic
mechanism that legalized market reforms already in place but never
fully realized its declared aim of abandoning centralized planning.
   While Kadar's reforms reputedly got a cool reception in Moscow,
the wily Hungary leader avoided the fate of fellow reformer
Alexander Dubcek. Czechoslovakia's liberal ``Prague Spring'' was
crushed by a 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion in which Kadar's troops took
part.
   In the 1970s, Kadar boosted living standards and tolerated a
degree of political discussion then unknown in the Soviet bloc.
   But the crisis that was to undo Kadar slowly mounted. Western
credits that helped fuel the consumer boom turned into a huge
foreign debt, exports slumped and many state-run firms became
unprofitable.
   An austerity program was finally adopted last year to revamp the
economy, but only fueled discontent. In the end, reformers
outweighed Kadar's traditional worker and party supporters, pushing
him aside to make way for Grosz.

   A drunken marine believed to be one
of President Corazon Aquino's guards killed 11 people, including
five members of a family, in a shooting spree in a Manila suburb,
police said Sunday.
   Cpl. Egliastico Afanto said Sgt. Marciano Contaoe was being
sought after the shooting spree late Saturday in Tagig.
   Police said they had no idea what prompted the shootings.
   Afanto said Contaoe was believed to be assigned to the
Presidential Security Group, the special multi-service guard force
assigned to protect Mrs. Aquino.
   Spokesmen for the security group were unavailable for comment.
   Police said Contaoe was drinking with several companions late
Saturday at the home of Sgt. Jesus Dalupay when an argument broke
out.
   They quoted Dalupay as saying he was out of the room when he
heard gunfire. He told police he rushed into the room to find two
drinking companions dead and a third wounded. The third victim
later died in a hospital.
   Police said witnesses told them that the assailant ran from the
house to his own home and emerged moments later with an M-16 rifle.
   He then allegedly went to the nearby home of Eliseo Jordias,
burst into the living room and opened fire, killing Jordias and
four of his children, ages 11, 8, 5 and 3 years.
   Contaoe again returned to his home, ordered his family to gather
their belongings and then fled with them, police said.
   Police said two other marine sergeants and a woman also were
killed in the rampage. The three were not identified.
   Police said Contaoe had been a respected member of the
community. They did not have his age or say how many years he had
been in the service.

   Turkish soldiers and Kurdish guerrillas
clashed in this township near the Syrian border in fighting that
left two Turkish soldiers dead, state radio reported Sunday.
   The radio, quoting Gaziantep governor Husnu Tuglu, said the
soldiers fought with a group of five or six guerrillas who tried to
slip into Turkey from Syria around midnight Saturday.
   It said the terrorists fled into Syria after the clash. It did
not identify the suspected affiliation of the guerrilla band.
However, most guerrillas operating in the region are linked to the
Kurdish Labor Party which seeks to set up a Marxist state in parts
of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   Turkish officials have refrained from publicly accusing Syria of
harboring and aiding Kurdish guerrillas and other groups hostile to
Turkey. Privately, intelligence officials say that Kurdish
insurgents have base camps in Syria and Iraq.
   Nearly 900 civilians and military personnel and an equal number
of Kurdish rebels have been killed since Kurdish guerrillas started
hit-and-run attacks in 1984. Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth
of Turkey's population of 52 million.

   At least five people died in
gunfights between Shiite and Sunni Moslems in a resort town in
mountainous northern Pakistan, the government said Sunday.
   ``There is still a lot of tension which we have to watch out
for,'' said a high-ranking Pakistani official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said at least five people had died in fighting in
the town of Gilgit since Tuesday. U.S. officials in Islamabad said
Saturday that up to 14 people may have died.
   Army troops were flown Sunday into Gilgit, 155 miles north of
the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, to enforce a 24-hour curfew,
said Western tourists arriving from the area.
   Britt Wilder, a Danish woman who was one of six tourists who
flew from Gilgit to Islamabad on Sunday, said 88 others were
awaiting flights out of the area.
   She said the town appeared quiet Sunday and that tourists were
not threatened in the fighting, which was centered in the town's
bazaar.
   Pakistan International Airlines spokemen said they were
scheduling as many flights as weather permitted. The commercial
carrier flies in and out of the rugged area only in clear weather
because of steep mountain peaks that surround the town.
   A U.S. official on Saturday said the Pakistan military had
offered to evacuate foreigners on C-130 transport planes if the
commercial airline was unable to fly.
   Returning tourists, mainly foreign diplomats and their
dependents based in Islamabad, said the trouble started Tuesday and
continued throughout the week in an apparent dispute over the end
of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   The breaking of the monthlong dawn-to-dusk fasting is determined
by the sighting of the new moon. The Moslem clergymen who are
appointed the task of ending Ramadan often disagree on the day.
   However, officials said it was the first time in recent memory
that it has sparked violence.
   Most of the country's 96 million people are Sunni Moslems.
Shiites comprise an estimated 15 percent of the population.

   Glasnost has given some Soviet couples a taste
of the good life not unlike their American counterparts, the
yuppies, reports Money magazine.
   In its June issue, the business magazine profiles a Moscow
couple, Valentin and Ludmilla Kaganovich, who enjoy the trappings
of Western young, upscale professionals.
   Both are dentists whose combined annual earnings of 13,200
rubles (about $22,440) put them in the top 3 percent of all Soviet
families.
   The couple pays the equivalent of $39 a month rent for their
apartment on fashionable Gorky Street. They own a country home, a
new car, color television set and a VCR, which cost $2,550, or
about six months' wages for the average Soviet worker.
   Kaganovich charted the way for his family's high standard of
living by operating a private dental practice while for 15 years
continuing to work at a state-run clinic.
   ``But before Gorbachev, people treated me like a bandit, even
when I worked like a dog,'' Kaganovich said. ``Now people treat me
with respect.''
   Still, besides a high income, living the good life in Moscow
requires good connections, the magazine reports. In a city where
consumers face shortages of so many things, money can be relatively
worthless without a network of friends and acquaintances with whom
to barter.
   ``If you have friends working in shops, they'll set nice things
aside for you,'' said Mrs. Kaganovich.

   The government has given the
International Committee of the Red Cross 15 days to free tons of
relief food and other items locked in its stores in the war-torn
northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea.
   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in letter to Jean-Jacque
Fresard, Red Cross representative in Ethiopia, that the stored food
is ``unjustifiably sustaining damage as a result of the
indifference, deliberately and consciously, pursued by ICRC.''
   The letter told the Red Cross that the government will take any
measure it considers appropriate if the food is not handed over to
Ethiopian authorities within 15 days.
   Ethiopia in early April ordered all foreign relief workers out
of Eritrea and Tigre for security reasons. Four U.N. Workers were
allowed to continue relief operations after a senior U.N. official
met with President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   Rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Eritrea and for 14
years in Tigre.
   The order for relief workers to leave was issued as the
government prepared for a counteroffensive following a series of
victories by the rebels.
   International Red Cross first said it was defying the order to
recall its 25 or so workers, citing a ``humanitarian responsibility
for the fate of some 5 million people'' in the two drought-stricken
provinces.
   When the government insisted that the Red Cross workers leave
the areas, the agency locked up its supplies and trucks and left.
   Red Cross officials have denied earlier requests to hand over
the food because they said they must be present to supervise the
food's distribution. In the past, there have been allegations that
food destined for starving farmers has gone to feed Ethiopian
soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Communist Party marked the
98th birthday of the late Ho Chi Minh by declaring a commitment to
reforming the party that he founded, Vietnamese radio reported
Sunday.
   The main aim of reform is to improve leadership and management
of the faltering economy, the official party newspaper Nhan Dan
said in an editorial to mark Ho's birthday Thursday.
   A text of a Radio Hanoi broadcast quoting the editorial was seen
in Bangkok on Sunday.
   The editorial said the party must not only ``renovate'' its
thinking, but find cadres qualified to forge ahead with pragmatic
economic reforms endorsed at the December 1986 sixth national party
congress.
   It urged a struggle against ``the two major dangers of the
ruling party _ the evil of bureaucratism, despotism and oppression
of the people, and the evil of embezzling the property of the
state, collectives and the people.''
   Ho founded the party in 1930 and led it to victories against the
French and the Japanese. He died in 1969, six years before the
communists won the war against U.S.-backed South Vietnam and
reunified the country.
   In the newly self-critical atmosphere under pragmatic party
chief Nguyen Van Linh, the party has made unprecedented admissions
of malaise, corruption, and ineptitude among its ranks. Vietnamese
officials say thousands have been purged from the
1.8-million-member party in the past year.

   Kent Phillips is the biggest jerk in
America, and he's proud of it.
   Phillips beat out 1,600 other entrants in a nationwide contest
sponsored by The Movie Channel to earn the title.
   As part of his prize, Phillips will fly to New York City next
month to tape four episodes of the premium cable channel's
``Drive-In Theater'' program with host Joe Bob Briggs.
   Although a lesser man might object to being known coast to coast
as a premier jerk, Phillips said, ``I wear the title proudly.''
   And the 22-year-old photographer, notified of his dubious
distinction a few weeks ago, says he never flinches at being called
a jerk around his fiancee and co-worker at the Bloomington
Herald-Telephone, copy editor Theresa Acquino.
   ``She knew that when she got involved with me,'' he said.
   But Phillips admits he entered the jerk contest hoping only for
a runner-up spot.
   ``I wanted a T-shirt,'' he explained. ``They were giving 100
consolation prizes that say `I'm a loser' on them.''
   But his entry letter was just too impressive for also-ran status.
   It began with a mock dictionary definition for jerk: ``1. Oaf,
cretin, ninny; 2. One who puts mustard on his Fruit Loops; 3. Kent
Phillips.''
   Under that was a picture of Phillips juggling three flaming
torches, plus a list of accomplishments and opinions, including:
   _Can juggle a bowling ball, ax and rubber chicken while playing
``Flight of the Bumble Bee'' on kazoo.
   _Can make anatomically correct balloon animals.
   _Life's ambition: to cut the tag off Minnie Pearl's hat.

<HEAD>Priest Who Performed Exorcism Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Karl Patzelt, a Catholic
priest who performed an exorcism for a Daly City family in 1973,
has died at 71.
   Patzelt died Thursday at the Sacred Heart Jesuit Center, where
he lived two years after Alzheimer's disease forced him to give up
his parish.
   The Austrian-born former pastor of Our Lady of Fatima Byzantine
Catholic Church in San Francisco, drew widespread publicity when it
was reported that he performed exorcism rites 14 times ``before a
great wave of heat hit the room and the household returned to
normal.''
   He said he visited the Daly City family's home and found
exterior signs of the devil, such as broken windows, marks and
dents on the walls caused by flying boots, knives and ``any other
object the devil could grab.''
   During the first seven exorcisms, the devil ``revealed
himself,'' he said. The couple were revived from unconsciousness
only by the touch of a relic of the Holy Cross, he said.
   Patzelt was drafted into the German army during World War II and
spent five years in a prisoner-of-war camp in the Soviet Union. He
came to the United States in 1957 to finish his religious training.
   He is survived by three brothers, Rudolf, Fritz and George
Patzelt; a niece, Monika Lovgren; and a nephew, Leo Patzelt, all of
Sweden.

<HEAD>New Orleans Senator Says Cajun Bill Would Threaten Black
Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black Louisiana lawmakers will fight
legislation making Cajuns a legally recognized minority in the
state because the measure threatens black economic development,
state Sen. Jon Johnson said Sunday.
   A measure granting Cajuns minority status was approved 74-22 in
the state House of Representatives Wednesday over the objections of
black lawmakers. They claim counting Cajuns as minorities would
dilute the black share of jobs on state projects that must by law
hire 10 percent minority workers.
   The bill is now in the hands of the state Senate, where Johnson,
a member of the Legislative Black Caucus, said it must be killed.
   ``I for one have absolutely no intention at all of letting a
group of individuals who have enjoyed anything from serving as
governor of this state on down who are going to come in and make an
attempt to share as a minority,'' said Johnson, a New Orleans
Democrat.
   Cajuns are descendants of French settlers expelled from Canada
who settled in the steamy bayou country of south Louisiana in the
1750s. The Louisiana Almanac estimates the number of Cajuns in the
state between 200,000 and 300,000. The state's population is about
4 million.
   Johnson said Cajuns have achieved much in the state. He noted
that former Gov. Edwin Edwards and current Lt. Gov. Paul Hardy are
Cajuns.
   ``There is nothing that is a minority about Gov. Edwards, who is
Cajun,'' said Johnson. ``There is nothing that is a minority about
Paul Hardy, who is Cajun.''
   On the House floor Wednesday, the bill's author, Raymond
``Lala'' LaLonde, entertained fellow lawmakers during floor debate
by conversing in Cajun French with fellow Rep. Raymond Laborde.
   But he later assured his colleagues of his sincerity.
   ``This is a very serious bill,'' he said. ``We are talking about
people who were stripped of their rights (when expelled from
Canada). When they came here, some of them were indentured. Some
were actually slaves.''

<HEAD>Polish Party Newspaper Rejects New Marshall Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper has rejected
a new proposed Marshall plan for Poland in exchange for
Western-inspired democratic reform, calling the idea ``alms that
would in addition subjugate Poland politically.''
   ``Are we today going to experience new dependence (on the West)
served in the wrapping of a new Marshall Plan?'' Trybuna Ludu said
in a commentary in its weekend edition. ``This would be stupidity
bordering on madness.''
   Several Western political commentators and leaders, including
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, suggested the
idea of a Western bailout during Polish labor unrest from April 25
to May 10. Such a plan would help Poland with its huge foreign debt
in exchange for democratization and other political reforms.
   The 1948-51 Marshall Plan, named after U.S. Secretary of State
George Marshall, distributed $12 billion in foreign aid from the
United States to rebuild Western Europe after World War II. The
plan offered help to Poland and other Eastern European countries,
but it was rejected under pressure from the Soviet Union, which saw
it as a bid to bring those nations under American influence.
   Poland struggles with a foreign debt of $39 billion, an aging
industrial base, 45 percent inflation, and average incomes of about
$100 a month. Its leaders have long been critical of Western
countries, saying they should do more to help.
   But Trybuna Ludu, the chief paper of the governing Polish United
Workers Party, said the government would not sacrifice political
beliefs for Western aid.
   Such a plan is intended to ``change the power alignment in
Europe'' and represents ``an attempt to make a vassal out of
Poland,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Spanish Entry into Western Alliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands marched through the capital
Sunday to protest the nation's planned entry into a Western
European military alliance.
   The organization, known as the Western European Union, is
designed to increase cooperation among European members of NATO and
promote discussion of defense issues facing Western Europe.
   Leftist political parties, labor unions, pacifists and anti-NATO
groups called the march to pressure the government of Socialist
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to stay out of the seven-nation
alliance.
   The government has scheduled participation to begin within a
year, with negotiations under way by autumn.
   Protesters marched Sunday behind large banners bearing the
slogans ``No to entry in the WEU,'' ``For total denuclearization''
and ``The (NATO) referendum has not been complied with.''
   In recent weeks, leftist and centrist political parties and
other groups have said the government's acceptance of port visits
by U.S. Navy ships violates the conditions of Spain's membership in
NATO. Spain bans storage or transport of nuclear weapons on its
territory.
   Organizers estimated Sunday's crowd at 5,000, but municipal
police put the number at 2,000. Police reported no violence.
   The alliance includes Britain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
France, Belgium, West Germany and Italy.

<HEAD>Cuomo, August Wilson Take Activist Messages to College Graduates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo urged University of Buffalo graduates Sunday to
use their talents to shape ``a world larger than the one that ends
in your own back yard,'' one of a number of activist messages at
commencement exercises this weekend.
   ``Unless we fall into the trap of self pity into the current
intellectual fad of looking for the roots of decline and decay in
every corner of the republic, then there is much, very much, to be
optimistic about and to hope for,'' Cumo told 1,800 graduates at
the Alumni Arena at Amherst, N.Y.
   ``Let's choose to go forward together to complete the miracle of
America and the family of mankind.''
   In St. Paul, Minn., Pulitzer Prize winning playwright August
Wilson told Macalester College graduates Saturday to ``remake the
truth of the society'' so that all Americans can share in freedom,
justice and equality.
   Wilson, a St. Paul resident who won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for
Drama for his play ``Fences,'' said blacks today can share in the
American dream only by denying their heritage and culture.
   ``Seventy years after my grandfather came into manhood, Africans
in America live in a society that refuses to recognize their
manners and conduct as part of a system that is fueled by its own
philosophy, mythology, history, creative motif, social organization
and ethos,'' said Wilson, who received an honorary degree from the
school.
   ``My grandfather's quest for freedom, justice and equality
continues unabated, uncompromising.''
   Along with the usual admonishments to fulfill their potential,
some of the nation's college graduates got some light-hearted
advice in commencement exercises this weekend.
   Author and humor columnist Russell Baker advised 368 Hood
College graduates Saturday not to mess up.
   Baker, who received an honorary degree in ceremonies in
Frederick, Md., said he had been told 40 years ago to go forth,
``and I went forth.
   ``I have done commencement speeches and told people to go forth.
Many have gone forth since then, since I went forth. And I feel the
world gets worse with each generation that goes forth. So
therefore, my advice to you today is, it's all right to go forth,
but don't make any more mess of the world than it already is.''
   Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who has written books on the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations, told 615 graduates of Simmons
College in Boston to enjoy themselves.
   ``I remember once learning that the richest and fullest lives
attain an inner balance comprised of work, life and play in equal
order and that to pursue one to the disregard of the others is to
open oneselves to the ultimate sadness of old age, whereas to
pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible an old
age filled with serenity and peace and fulfillment.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the front-runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination, attended the ceremonies at Simmons Sunday
along with his wife Kitty, and her father, Harry Ellis Dickson.
Mrs. Dukakis' brother-in-law, Alfred C. Peters, received a masters
degree in social work.
   Elsewhere, baritone William Warfield advised University of
Rochester graduates Sunday to do more than what is required to get
by in life.
   ``Don't be a hack,'' he said.
   ``Be dedicated to the full development of your talent.''
   Broadway playwright and director George Abbott, who is 100,
lectured the school's 2,300 graduates in Rochester, N.Y., about the
benefits of longevity.
   ``If you want to be a success, to be greeted with applause
wherever you go, then all you have to do is live to be over 100,''
he said.
   Abbott, a member of the class of 1911, was awarded the alumni
Medal of Honor in recognition of his 75-year theatrical career, in
which he has been involved in about 200 plays and musicals.
   ``The world is yours. Use it wisely,'' novelist and travel
writer Paul Theroux told an audience of 22,000 at the University of
Massachusetts Sunday, including 4,661 graduates.
   ``Only bigoted, paranoid or superstitious people regard the
world as baffling. It is quite knowable, not a rabbit hole or an
enigma or a sideshow,'' said Theroux. The author of ``The Mosquito
Coast'' and ``The Great Railway Bazaar'' was awarded an honorary
doctor of humane letters degree.

   Severe thunderstorms lashed the central Gulf Coast again Sunday
while showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over the
central Plains and the mid-Atlantic states.
   While cloudy skies prevailed across the eastern two thirds of
the country, it was sunny over much of the West.
   Thunderstorms moved out of Texas across Louisiana and into
Mississippi during the morning, producing hail and strong winds.
The storms were expected to continue into Sunday night.
   Showers and scattered thunderstorms also hit much of Arkansas
and Missouri, and showers were prevalent across the central Plains.
   Memphis, Tenn., received 0.80 inch of rain in the six hours
ended 2 p.m. EDT and Lincoln, Neb., got a half inch in the same
period.
   In the Northeast, there were scattered showers and thunderstorms
in New York State, eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and
western New England in the early afternoon. Altoona, Pa., recorded
just over half an inch of rain in the six hours ending at 2 p.m.
EDT.
   A few showers and thunderstorms lingered along the southern
Atlantic Coast, and a few showers also were developing ahead of a
cold front entering the northern Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures were in the 80s in the thunderstorm areas of the
central Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast, as well as in
southern Texas and the Ohio Valley. Readings climbed into the 90s
and over 100 degrees in the Southwest deserts.
   Early afternoon temperatures were only in the upper 40s and 50s
in parts of the central Plains and Colorado and Wyoming.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 48 degrees at Goodland,
Kan., to 105 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Monday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to extend
from northern Florida and the central Gulf Coast to the
mid-Atlantic Coast and southern sections of the Great Lakes, with
the heaviest concentration in the Ohio Valley. Scattered showers
and thunderstorms also were forecast for the middle Mississippi
Valley to Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. Fair to partly sunny skies
were predicted for the rest of the nation.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 60s in the central Plains and
lower Missouri Valley, and in the Pacific Northwest; and in the 80s
from the central Gulf Coast to the mid-Atlantic Coast, in North
Dakota and much of Montana, and from interior California to
southern and central Texas, with highs climbing into the 90s or
above 100 in the Southwest deserts.
   Elsewhere, highs were predicted to be in the 70s.

<TEXT>
   Janos Kadar, leader of Hungary's
Communist Party since 1956, was replaced Sunday by Premier Karoly
Grosz in a sweeping reshuffle that brought outspoken reformers into
the ruling elite.
   Kadar also left the ruling Politburo and was given the largely
ceremonial post of party president, in changes announced at the end
of a three-day national party conference.
   The 75-year-old revolutionary, increasingly seen as an obstacle
to political change demanded by some party members, had been
expected to step down as general secretary of the Communist Party.
   Politburo member Janos Berecz told a packed news conference that
Kadar asked not to be nominated for the party leadership, citing
his age and what Berecz termed ``the need for renewal.''
   The conference also appointed new, more reform-minded Politburo
and approved a policy document, details of which were expected
later Sunday or on Monday.
   ``This conference marks a radical change,'' Grosz told Hungarian
television minutes after being named new party general secretary.
``We have faced critically the errors committed earlier.''
   ``A new approach is needed in public life, in production, in
human sectors and other fields,'' said Grosz, who at 57 is a leader
in the mold of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, with a vigorous
public manner and a reputation as a pragmatist.
   Since becoming premier in June last year, Grosz has imposed
austerity measures to try and reduce a net foreign debt of $10.9
billion, deregulate prices and close down loss-making state-owned
firms.
   Gorbachev on Sunday cabled his congratulations to Grosz, the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Gorbachev wished Grosz success ``in tackling the tasks of
improving and renovating the socialist society on Hungarian soil,''
Tass said.
   Asked whether the Soviet Union was consulted about the change of
power, Berecz told reporters, ``Nobody wants to believe that we
make sovereign decisions, although we do. We intend to inform our
friends of the new appointments, and hope they will be received
with support.''
   Looking tired, Kadar gave a final speech to the party conference
once the new leadership was announced, gracefully thanking retirees
for their past work and wishing newcomers success.
   ``I twice spoke to this party conference and would not like to
repeat myself,'' Kadar said. ``I am convinced that these three days
of hard work have been effective.''
   With the replacement of Kadar, Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov is the
last party leader surviving from the 1950s in the Soviet bloc.
   Grosz becomes party leader of a revamped Politburo trimmed of
aging bureaucrats and stacked with reformers. Most notable among
the liberals were Imre Pozsgay and Reszo Nyers, the father of
Hungary's economic reform in the 1960s who was dropped from the
Politburo in 1973.
   Pozsgay has called on the government to allow trade unions and
political organizations independent of the Communist Party.
   The announcement that Kadar was out as party leader was greeted
with long, enthusiastic applause by almost 1,000 conference
delegates.
   ``This is an exceptional day for Hungary,'' said a prominent
party official who supports reform. ``We are proud that we have
shown that it is possible to do this gracefully. Kadar was a great
leader but was clearly no longer competent to hold power.''
   Kadar is the first East Bloc party boss to relinquish power
after such an open debate on the merits of his leadership.
   In December, Czechoslovak party leader Gustav Husak, 75, was
replaced by Milos Jakes, a 65-year-old party loyalist. But the
switch was made under the cloak of secrecy at a Central Committee
meeting.
   Kadar took over the party leadership in 1956 after Moscow
brought in troops and tanks to quash an anti-Soviet revolt and
arrested liberal leader Imre Nagy.
   He won popularity at home and abroad by encouraging economic
reforms that brought Hungarian consumers prosperity and by
tolerating a freedom of discussion rare in the Soviet bloc in the
1970s.
   In a speech Friday, Kadar denounced reformist efforts as threats
to single-party rule.
   In a brief interview with Hungarian television, Grosz asked for
the support of Hungary's 10.6 million citzens and said he will do
his best so that the nation gets rid of its pressing problems.
   Hungary's a net foreign debt is the largest per capita in the
East bloc. Inflation has touched 18 percent this year, and more
price rises and unemployment are expected as the austerity program
Grosz enacted in September takes hold.
   Asked about holding two offices, Grosz said he favored the
earliest possible separation of his jobs as party head and premier.
   In the sweeping upheaval of leading party organs, the Politburo
shrank to 11 members from the previous 13.
   Eight old members of the Politburo were dropped in the
reshuffle. A new 108-member Central Committee replaced the former
106-member body, with about one-third of old members failing to
gain reelection to the new body.

<TEXT>
   Uniformed police officers will form a
backdrop and presidential press secretary James Brady will look on
in an elaborate ceremony planned for signing of a bill banning the
sale of cheap handguns in Maryland.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer plans to sign the bill Monday at
the Maryland State House, where more than 200 police officers are
expected to take part, said Luther Starnes, Schaefer's assistant
press secretary.
   The main speaker will be Sarah Brady, who became active in
gun-control efforts nationally after her husband was seriously
wounded in the assassination attempt on President Reagan by John
Hinckley Jr.
   Legislative leaders and other officials who helped push the bill
through the General Assembly last month also have been invited.
   Schaefer aides say the ceremony is not intended to send a
message to pro-gun groups that are collecting signatures on
petitions to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in
November.
   State officials characterize the bill as unique in that it sets
up a board to determine what handguns can be sold in Maryland
beginning in 1990. It will be legal to possess guns approved by the
review board, but it will be against the law for anyone, including
private owners, to sell weapons not on the approved list.
   The law is primarily aimed at the cheap handguns, known as
Saturday night specials, that are often used in street crimes.
   The review board also is directed to omit from the list of
approved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed or
altered and guns made primarily of plastic that aren't easily
detected by metal detectors.
   Weldon Clark, founder of a group called Stop Gun Prohibition,
said his group is convinced it can easily collect the 33,044
signatures needed to force a referendum on the bill in November.
   Ted Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs,
said the bill was steamrolled through the Legislature in an
atmosphere of emotional hysteria.
   He said the public was deluded ``into thinking it (the bill)
will have an impact on crime, which it won't.''
   Vincent Demarco, who resigned as an assistant state attorney
general to head Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse, said his group
is concerned about a referendum even though public opinion polls
show overwhelming support for a ban on the sale of Saturday night
specials.
   ``The NRA has won referendums in other states by spending a lot
of money and misrepresenting the situation and telling people
falsehoods,'' he said.

   A shopping center was closed for
several hours and dozens of businesses evacuated after police found
a small cache of weapons inside a pickup. They used the mall's
parking lot to detonate some of the devices.
   Michael Reno, 31, of Clayton was booked for investigation of
possession of explosive devices and illegal firearms after an
officer who had stopped him for a mechanical violation Saturday saw
a pipe bomb and a sawed-off shotgun on the front seat, police said.
   The shotgun was loaded, said police Cpl. Ralph Sanzeri.
   Police also found seven explosive devices, two rifles and
survival equipment, Sanzeri said.
   The Gregory Village Shopping Center in the East Bay area north
of San Francisco was shut down for about three hours as authorities
removed and destroyed the bombs. The University of California at
Berkeley police bomb squad detonated some of the pipe bombs in the
parking lot and defused several others.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World chess champion Gary Kasparov
defeated a dogged Dutch opponent Sunday to stake out a one-point
lead against archrival Anatoly Karpov in a four-player contest.
   Kasparov's seventh-round victory came against John van der Wiel
and gave him the tournament lead over Anatoly Karpov, a fellow
Soviet who is ranked second in the world. Karpov was held to a draw
Sunday by Dutch champion Jan Timman, ranked third in the world.
   The four-way contest pits the world's two leading players for
the first time since Kasparov retained his title last year in
Seville, Spain. He beat Karpov in 1985 to become world champion.
   The tournament also marks Kasparov's return to the international
tournament arena after a nearly yearlong absence.
   Playing white against Van der Wiel's Queen's Indian defense,
Kasparov soon got the upper hand Sunday. He forced his opponent
into a cramped position and devastated his Queen's side pawn
structure, while gradually improving his own array.
   Halfway through the game, Van der Wiel compounded his own
problems by running into time trouble, and Kasparov seemed ready to
deliver the coup de grace. He grabbed control of the center and
sacrificed an exchange to storm black's King's side.
   But with under 10 minutes on the clock for 20 moves separating
him from time control, Van der Wiel dug in his heels. A desperate
counter-offensive almost forced Kasparov to return all his spoils.
   But when the Dutchman made it to the time check, it turned out
that the world champion had nicely calculated his chances. With
four pawns against his opponent's three, he was in winning position.
   Van der Wiel resigned on his 45th, when he stood to lose another
pawn or go mate.
   Karpov's encounter with Timman was more routine. Sometimes
called ``vice-world champion,'' Karpov played black with his pet
Caro-Kann defense and easily held the balance throughout the
opening.
   Exasperated by Karpov's conservative defensive play, Timman
initiated a risky variation but got nowhere.
   The two players continued until the 43rd, exchanging pieces
without really changing anything and then agreed to the draw.
   Kasparov was left in first place with five points and a record
of three wins and four draws, while Karpov tallied four with two
wins, four draws and a loss.
   Timman was third with 3{ points and Van der Wiel last with 1{.
   The tournament, organized by the Amsterdam European Options
Exchange for its 10th anniversary, was to continue Monday. Kasparov
plays Timman with white, and Karpov faces Van der Wiel with black.

   Hundreds of Russian avant-guard paintings banned
from public view since 1932 will be displayed in Leningrad and
published under a joint American-Soviet project this fall,
publishers said.
   The collection of Russian avant-guard art, including previously
unexhibited works by Kandinsky and Malevich, is believed to be the
largest ever to be displayed in that country or published in the
West, Paul Gottleib, publisher at Harry N. Abrams Inc., said at a
news conference here Friday.
   The company is producing the art book in conjunction with
Sovietsky Khudozhnik, the Soviet art publishing house.
   Nearly all the artworks were produced legally before 1932, when
the All-Union Congress of Artists succumbed to a cultural chill
under Stalin and decreed that only ``Socialist Realism'' would be
appropriate in the young communist country.
   ``We professionals knew about this art even in the worst times.
But now, (under glasnost, the new policy of openness) the general
audience is interested in anything ... particularly of the period''
before Stalin, said Mikhail Anikst, creative director of the book
project.
   Gottleib, Anikst and Vladimir Viktorovich Gorianov, a Soviet
publisher, showed photographs of the works at the news conference.
   The works of more than 170 artists, most of whom are dead, will
be displayed for at least three months in Leningrad but will not
travel to other Soviet museums. No plans have been set for taking
the exhibit outside the country, Gorianov said.
   Many Russian avant-guard artists, who were among the leaders
worldwide at the time, continued to work illegally after 1932 and
marked the birth of Russian underground art, said Phyllis Freemam,
an editor of the book.

   A rare leatherback
sea turtle, which weighed 700 pounds and was six feet long, has
been found dead on a beach at Santa Rosa Island off the California
coast.
   The turtle, which spends much of its life hundreds of miles
offshore, was only the third leatherback found on Southern
California beaches in the last 15 years. All were dead.
   The discovery was made last week by Bill Ehorn, superintendent
of Channel Islands National Park.
   Leatherbacks, which weigh up to 2,000 pounds, are believed to
live as long as 100 years.
   Gary Davis, 43, marine biologist for the park, removed the skull
and bones Thursday and sent them to the Santa Barbara Museum of
Natural History, where they will be held for scientists to study.
His autopsy did not determine the cause of death.

<HEAD>Opposition Politician Seeks Halt in Mineral Sales to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing government
opponent on Sunday called for suspending strategic mineral sales to
the United States in response to threats of heavier U.S. economic
sanctions.
   Clive Derby-Lewis of the Conservative Party urged a ban on sales
of platinum and other key minerals that the United States obtains
primarily from South Africa.
   ``Why should South Africa kowtow to the U.S.?'' he said in a
statement. The United States ``is deliberately undermining the
economy of South Africa at great cost to all of its inhabitants.''
   ``The United States is cynically oblivious to the double
standards inherent in their policy of normal trade with the
Communist Bloc countries, who have no record whatsoever of human
rights beliefs,'' Derby-Lewis said.
   The U.S. Congress is weighing a sanctions package that would cut
most bilateral economic ties in a bid to pressure South Africa into
speeding up race reform. In 1986, Congress placed limited sanctions
on South Africa.
   South Africa supplies about 80 percent of the platinum sold to
the non-communist world. It has the world's largest known reserves
of strategic minerals such as manganese, chromium, vanadium and
titanium.
   The world's other main supplier of strategic minerals is the
Soviet Union.
   Foreign Minister Rolef ``Pik'' Botha reiterated last week the
government has no intention of withholding strategic minerals to
Western nations, even if they impose sanctions.
   By law and custom, South Africa's apartheid policies have
established a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

<TEXT>
   Laurie Dann's last day of life had a
fearful toll: one child dead and six people wounded, a house fire
and deliveries of poisoned food. Now authorities are struggling to
understand her state of mind.
   ``This is a seriously destroyed individual who lost control and
acted out all of her delusions,'' said Harold Visotsky, professor
and chairman of the department of psychiatry at Northwestern
University Medical School.
   Ms. Dann shot herself to death Friday after killing an
8-year-old boy and wounding five other children in a rampage at
Hubbard Woods Elementary School north of Chicago.
   She also shot a 20-year-old man who tried to wrest a gun from
her at a home nearby.
   Shortly before the shootings, she delivered arsenic-laced snacks
and juice to two Northwestern University fraternities and several
homes where she had worked as a babysitter. There were no serious
injuries.
   Police said the death toll might have been higher had it not
been for the actions of a substitute teacher at the elementary
school who refused Dann's order to herd together the 24 children in
her room. Instead, the teacher grabbed the assailant's gun hand,
but Ms. Dann pulled out a second pistol and opened fire.
   ``I just acted instinctually. I just wanted to protect the
children,'' said the 29-year-old teacher, Amy Moses.
   At a news conference Sunday, Ms. Moses said: ``I really just
went on automatic pilot. ... I can't explain how unreal the whole
situation was.''
   In an interview Sunday, Visotsky said Ms. Dann ``probably had a
symbolic reason for every one of (the acts of violence).''
   Visotsky said that Ms. Dann probably saw herself as a victim and
sought revenge against those who had ``diminished her sense of
self-worth.''
   Police Chief Herbert Timm said: ``There obviously is a
connection with children here. We don't know what.''
   Elizabeth Kaufman, an acquaintance, said Sunday, ``I know that
she felt that she had no one to talk to.
   ``I always thought she was a little bit odd, but I always
thought she was harmless. She was a nice person,'' Ms. Kaufman said
in a telephone interview from Lubbock, Texas, where she recently
moved.
   ``She was always trying to help people to be happy, which is
what's so strange about this.''
   Meanwhile, members of the clergy used Sunday services to pray
for the victims and Ms. Dann. Six victims remained hospitalized,
four in serious condition and one in critical condition, officials
said.
   ``Today we will pray for Laurie Dann because, for what she did,
she could not have been in her right mind,'' the Rev. Mike Weston
of Sacred Heart Catholic Church said. ``And because she was once a
child and a Christian and ... because Jesus prayed for his
enemies.''
   Visotsky agreed with police who believe the chain of violence
probably was triggered when Ms. Dann learned a family for whom she
babysat planned to leave Illinois.
   Police said that on the morning of the shootings, Ms. Dann set a
small fire in the family's house and gave tainted milk to two of
the family's children.
   But her troubles had begun sooner.
   Authorities in Arizona were ready to indict Ms. Dann on charges
of making threatening phone calls to a former boyfriend, and Lake
County, Ill., prosecutors planned similar charges in another case.
   In Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann often lived, police said they
interviewed her five days before she died after they received
reports she was acting erratically.
   Capt. Jeffrey Frye said three Madison officers and a resident
manager at The Towers, a private dormitory complex near the
University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, entered Ms. Dann's room May
15 with a master key and talked with her.
   Someone earlier had found her ``in a storage room in The Towers
covered with a plastic bag and sweating profusely,'' Frye said.
   ``They determined there wasn't a whole lot they could do with
her,'' he said.
   ``We had gotten some information ... that she may have a weapon
or may have access to a .357-Magnum,'' Frye said. No gun was found,
he said.
   Ms. Dann was due to stand trial in Madison on charges of
shoplifting several women's wigs March 14.
   Greg Rogers, owner of a card shop in Madison, said Saturday that
official-looking letters addressed to Ms. Dann at his store have
been arriving for about 10 weeks. But he said he did not know her
or why mail for her would be coming to his address.
   Dr. Joseph Flaherty, professor of psychiatry and preventive
medicine at the University of Illinois-Chicago, said Ms. Dann may
have suffered from a borderline personality disorder or paranoid
psychosis.
   People who suffer from these disorders ``develop a strong
feeling that they have been wronged, that people are against them
and they should retaliate,'' he said.

   A 22-year-old pregnant woman was killed
while talking on the telephone when a bolt of lightning struck the
phone lines outside her house, authorities said.
   Laura McDowell, who was eight months pregnant, and the fetus
died from lightning that struck about 5 p.m. Saturday as a heavy
band of thunderstorms moved through the central New York region,
Cayuga County sheriff's deputies said. Emergency room doctors were
unable to resuscitate Ms. McDowell, Auburn Memorial Hospital
nursing supervisor Nancy Purdy said.
   Ms. McDowell's 3-year-old daughter witnessed her mother's death
and several of the victim's relatives were sitting in the living
room when the accident occurred.
   Ms. McDowell's stepbrother, Allen Harmon, 17, told authorities
the bolt knocked things off the wall and threw Ms. McDowell from
the chair in which she was sitting.
   The phone was blackened by the electrical charge, which
authorities estimated was between 10,000 and 50,000 volts. About 50
volts can jog the human heart.
   Howard G. Williams, a spokesman for New York Telephone Co., said
such a fatality was rare because although telephone lines carry low
voltages, they are grounded and insulated against transporting
strong electrical charges.
   However, Williams cautioned that it is still unwise to talk on
the telephone during a thunderstorm because electricity can be
drawn into the home on its way to the ground.
   Authorities said the exact cause of McDowell's death would be
determined with an autopsy.

<HEAD>Fugitive Condemns Extradition Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive Irish nationalist wanted on a
murder charge held a clandestine news conference Sunday near the
Northern Ireland border to condemn the British-Irish extradition
treaty, an Irish news agency reported.
   Security officials, hearing of the meeting, ordered an immediate
intensification of the hunt for Patrick McIntyre, a member of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The 30-year-old fugitive met with journalists at a whitewashed
farmhouse in remote mountain country about 20 miles from the border
in County Donegal, the news agency Ireland International said.
   The handful of reporters were instructed by an anonymous tipoff
to drive to a road near McIntyre's hometown, Letterkenny, then were
driven in a blacked-out van for a half-hour to the secret farmhouse
meeting, the agency said.
   ``Irish citizens can be arrested on the word of the British
government and extradited. There are no safety measures. Any Irish
citizen can be arrested solely on an extradition warrant,'' the
agency quoted McIntyre as saying.
   Britain announced May 13 that Ireland had agreed to resume
extradition of terrorist suspects, following a five-month wrangle
over legal procedures.
   The two governments have long been at odds over the Irish
Republic's reluctance to extradite suspects sought for trial in
connection with the IRA's bloody battle to end British rule of
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic guerrilla group wants to unite the
province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Catholic.
   McIntyre, unshaven and clad in jeans and a T-shirt, added that
although on the run he had no intention of leaving Ireland. ``I
don't believe the British government should force an Irish citizen
out of his country,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
   He is wanted on 21 charges, including murder, in connection with
the 1983 mass escape from Maze Prison in Northern Ireland, where he
had been serving a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of a
part-time soldier.
   McIntyre had been recaptured 24 hours after the breakout in
which a guard was killed, but fled custody while on Christmas
parole in 1986.
   He was re-arrested by Irish police, but walked free from the
High Court in Dublin in May 1987 after a judge ruled he had been
unlawfully arrested. He was driven off at high speed on a
motorcycle and has not been seen since, although he is still being
sought on extradition warrants.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson told striking workers on
Sunday he will push hard to get his ``workers' bill of rights''
included in the Democratic Party platform. And he criticized rival
Michael Dukakis on economics and the fight against drugs.
   Neither Dukakis nor George Bush, the certain GOP nominee,
campaigned on Sunday.
   Jackson, campaigning for California's June 7 primary, told
striking workers they were victims of ``economic violence,'' said
the party must adopt his 10-point plan for ``democracy in the
workplace.''
   That plan, which Jackson has presented at previous labor
rallies, addresses matters such as a woman's right to pregnancy
leave and guarantees of a safe workplace.
   ``You deserve a living wage. You deserve job security. You
deserve respect,'' Jackson told about 1,000 members and supporters
of Teamsters Joint Council 8.
   The workers have been on strike against United Foods Inc., a
frozen foods firm, for 11 months.
   The Democratic Party ``must stand with the working people. It's
the legacy of (President Franklin) Roosevelt. It's the unfinished
business of Dr. (Martin Luther) King,'' Jackson said.
   ``Today I'm fighting for a working people's platform,'' Jackson
said. ``I want a mandate from you as I take your case to Atlanta
and to the White House.''
   Jackson was referring to the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta, which begins July 18. As his prospects for winning the
nomination become increasingly remote, Jackson has been stressing
his expected impact on the party platform.
   ``When I win, workers win,'' Jackson told the crowd.
   He also renewed his criticism of Dukakis, who is heavily favored
to win the California contest, garnering enough delegates to assure
him the nomination.
   Dukakis' economic plans, Jackson said, are ``very conservative,
very cautious, very inadequate.''
   Jackson also sought to contrast his own policies with those of
Dukakis.
   ``I've made the fight against drugs the No. 1 issue of the
campaign. Dukakis is against drugs now, but he has no plan. I have
a commitment to fight a war against drugs.''
   Later, in the coastal resort and college community of Santa
Cruz, Jackson performed the marriage vows for Jim Monday and
Rebecca Steen, daughter of hostage Alann Steen, and then introduced
the newlyweds at a campaign rally where he pledged to work for
Steen's release.
   ``We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We will
not rest until the whole Middle East is set free, because the whole
Middle East is held hostage,'' Jackson said.
   Steen was taken hostage in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was home in Massachusetts, where he
dedicated a memorial to a local politican and friend, Allan Sidd,
who died 11 years ago.
   ``He loved politics. He loved being involved,'' Dukakis said of
Sidd as he dedicated a sundial in a hilltop park in Brookline,
where the governor lives.
   The governor reminisced about Sidd's help in his first foray
into elective politics, on Brookline's Democratic town committee,
back in the 1960s.
   Dukakis returned home from California on Saturday night. He
planned to spend Monday at the statehouse and campaign Monday night
in New Jersey, which like California holds its primary June 7.
   Dukakis was scheduled to campaign in California later this week.
   Later, in the coastal resort and college community of Santa
Cruz, Jackson performed the marriage vows for Jim Monday and
Rebecca Steen, daughter of hostage Alann Steen, and then introduced
the newlyweds at a campaign rally where he pledged to work for
Steen's release.
   ``We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We will
not rest until the whole Middle East is set free, because the whole
Middle East is held hostage,'' Jackson said.
   Steen was taken hostage in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.

   The pilot of an American Airlines DC-10
carrying 254 people aborted his takeoff because a warning light
indicated a problem with the jumbo jet's wing slats, an airline
spokesman said Sunday.
   ``I understand that the warning light had to do with ... the
leading edge slats'' over the front of the wing, American spokesman
John Hotard said.
   Hotard said the airline would investigate whether there was a
problem with the slats or if the warning light itself malfunctioned.
   Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board took the
cockpit recorders from the plane Sunday night and turned the
aircraft over to the airline, which faces the difficult task of
removing it from the field beyond the runway.
   Flight 70, bound for Frankfurt, West Germany, ran off the
runway, its front landing gear collapsed in the rain-softened grass
and the aircraft skidded 1,000 feet on its nose to a stop.
   The airline planned to remove the plane later Sunday or Monday,
a ``very laborious project'' that will require support for the
front of the plane, Hotard said.
   The plane was not preventing other traffic from using the
runway, officials said.
   Capt. Bob Cornelison was held for observation overnight at
Baylor Medical Center and was released Sunday, a Baylor spokesman
said. Two other members of the flight crew and three passengers
were treated for minor injuries and released from local hospitals
Saturday.

   A member of the mixed-race
chamber of Parliament was fatally shot in his car Sunday night by
an unknown assailant, police said.
   Police said Peter Sam Jacobs, a member of the majority Labor
Party in the House of Representatives, was shot while returning
from a meeting at a church to his home near Alberton, southeast of
Johannesburg.
   Police said the window of Jacobs' car had been smashed by the
attacker, but gave no indication who the killer was and what the
motive might have been.
   Jacobs, whose age was not immediately available, was elected to
Parliament in 1984 after a new constitution was adopted creating
chambers for Asians and mixed-race people along with the existing
chamber for whites.
   The new constitution continued to exclude the black majority
from national politics. Anti-apartheid activists of all races
organized a boycott of the Asian and mixed-race elections which
helped keep the turnout below 20 percent.
   The Labor Party has remained estranged from the mainstream of
the anti-apartheid movement, although its leader, the Rev. Allan
Hendrickse, has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward
President P.W. Botha in the past year while demanding abolition of
apartheid legislation.
   Under apartheid law and custom, South Africa's 26 million blacks
have no vote in national affairs while the country's 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

   Georgia's Republican Party could be left with
two competing delegations to the party's national convention in New
Orleans this summer, in the wake of a weekend dispute at the state
GOP convention.
   Atlanta lawyer Matt Patton took the podium at Saturday's party
convention after an angry walkout by GOP Chairman John Stuckey, who
adjourned the meeting and left along with several hundred party
regulars.
   The more than 900 Republicans who remained elected Patton to
preside and continued the convention on their own, adopting a party
platform and electing 18 at-large delegates to the National
Republican Convention in New Orleans.
   Stuckey said he would convene a meeting of the party's state
executive committee to select the official at-large delegates,
leaving open the possibility of two Georgia delegations showing up
in New Orleans.
   Thirty other GOP delegates were already picked at district
conventions.
   Stuckey had presided Friday over an abbreviated session marked
by chanting and booing by many of the 968 delegates _ mostly Pat
Robertson supporters and newcomers to party politics _ who had been
disqualified by the party regulars' credentials committee.
   The credentials committee, complying with a court order,
considered and granted appeals by many of the disqualified
delegates Friday evening and, on Saturday, party officials began
the lengthy process of registering the official delegates.
   But Stuckey adjourned the convention, saying it had been taken
over by what he described as an unruly mob. After leaving the
platform, he told reporters the court rulings would be appealed to
the state's highest court and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Carl Gillis, a national committeeman from Adrian, said the
party's national credentials committee may have to decide which
delegation to recognize.
   ``This will probably wind up in an awful mess,'' Gillis added.
   The general counsel for the national Republican Party said the
party's nine-member contest committee will hear from both sides and
report its findings to the party's credentials committee.
   ``These people have done this job before and they play this game
strictly by the book,'' said Roger Allen Moore of Boston.

the Will Maston Trio after World War I and took his act on to
vaudeville, stage and nightclubs.
   Davis played Fletcher Henderson in the 1955 film, ``The Benny
Goodman Story'' and made numerous television appearances. His last

   Giorgio Almirante, who had a minor role in Benito
Mussolini's last government and was a founder and longtime leader
of Italy's small but vocal neo-fascist party, died Sunday of heart
disease at age 73.
   Elected to the the Chamber of Deputies 11 times from 1948 to
1987, Almirante had been charged with helping a right-wing
terrorist, but the charges were dropped under a 1987 amnesty.
   His Italian Social Movement was the political heir to
Mussolini's fascist creation. By 1987, it had had become Italy's
fourth-largest party in Parliament, holding 5.9 percent of the
seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Another former party leader and founder, Pino Romualdi, 77, died
of cancer Friday. The editor of the party newspaper, he was elected
to the Chamber of Deputies seven times between 1953 and 1979 and
was a senator from 1983 to 1987.

   Karl Patzelt, a Catholic priest who
performed an exorcism for a Daly City family in 1973, died Thursday
at the age of 71.
   Patzelt was drafted into the German army during World War II and
spent five years in a prisoner-of-war camp in the Soviet Union. He
came to the United States in 1957 to finish his religious training.

   Patzelt drew widespread publicity when he said he visited the
Daly City family's home and found signs of the devil in broken
windows, marks and dents on the walls caused by boots, knives and
``any other object the devil could grab.''
   It was reported that he performed exorcism rites 14 times
``before a great wave of heat hit the room and the household
returned to normal.''

<HEAD>Sister-In-Law Of Simmons Wants Second Trial For 14 Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union
will hold talks Monday to try to find a way to override the wishes
of convicted mass-murderer R. Gene Simmons and halt his planned
execution, an official said.
   The ACLU is concerned that Simmons could go from trial to
execution without a review by another court, a situation
unprecedented in recent U.S. judicial history, Jay Jacobson,
executive director of the ACLU's Arkansas chapter, said Saturday.
   The chapter's executive committee agreed Saturday to do
something about the Simmons case, but it remains unclear what
action the organization can take because it has no direct stake in
the case, Jacobson said.
   Typically, defendants or their close relatives appeal death
sentences.
   Potential actions range from issuing a statement expressing
disappointment at a lack of mandatory review to ``filing some sort
of litigation,'' Jacobson said.
   Simmons was scheduled last week to die by injection on June 27
for the Dec. 28 murders of Kathy Kendrick and David Chaffin during
a 45-minute shooting rampage in Russellville.
   He has said no one should try to halt the execution, which he
described as correct punishment for his conviction for capital
murder.
   Simmons also is scheduled to stand trial July 18 for the
Christmas holiday shooting and strangulation deaths of his wife,
Rebecca, and 13 other members of his family.
   Survivors of the family members want Simmons tried for their
deaths before he is executed for the two other slayings, Simmons'
sister-in-law said.
   Edith Nesby, sister of Rebecca Simmons, was quoted in the
Russellville Courier Democrat Saturday as saying she and other
survivors ``still cry for justice.''
   ``They can't put him to death three times, that's true, but when
he does go to death, we want him to go to death for all the
deaths,'' she was quoted as saying from Briggsdale, Colo., where
the cremated remains of Mrs. Simmons and four of her children are
buried.

<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia paid a surprise
visit Sunday to an Andean town where residents say troops killed
dozens of people in retaliation for the guerrilla ambush of a
military convoy.
   ``Democracy at times may make mistakes but its biggest mistake
would be to hide anything,'' Garcia told reporters in Ayacucho.
   While a government communique earlier Sunday said a ministerial
commission denied reports of the killings, Garcia and a later
government statement said an investigation will continue.
   Ayacucho's district attorney said troops killed at least 20
peasants on May 14 in the town of Cayara, 30 miles south of the
provincial capital, and that soldiers were not cooperating with his
investigation. A congressional investigative commission said at
least 30 were slain.
   Garcia flew to Cayara in a military helicopter from Ayacucho,
where he was attending a meeting of youth leaders of his
center-left Aprista Party. He said he spoke with residents and
officials in Cayara.
   Garcia also met with Carlos Enrique Escobar, the state's
district attorney. ``I know that yesterday was a visit by a
ministerial commission, but I would also like to listen to the
point of view of Dr. Escobar, who has had some preoccupations that
must be clarified,'' Garcia told reporters. ``My suggestion will be
that the commission that was here yesterday return accompanied with
Dr. Escobar.''
   Garcia, protected by heavy security, said the investigation
should continue in order to clarify exactly how many people died
and their cause of death.
   A communique signed by Prime Minister Armando Villanueva in
Lima, the nation's capital, said a government investigative
commission visited the town Saturday and found no evidence of a
massacre.
   The statement said testimony from villagers proved the
``falsehood of reports of rapes of women, house-burnings,
bombardments, assassination of children, a hundred deaths and other
acts of genocide.''
   But in a second communique issued Sunday night, the Lima
government said testimony gathered from townspeople indicated
``unclarified armed acts'' took place in the village and said the
investigation would continue.
   The government said it was ordering the military command in
Ayacucho, high in the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima, to
cooperate fully with the investigation being conducted by the
district attorney's office.
   The government commission was composed of Defense Minister Gen.
Enrique Lopez Albujar, Justice Minister Camilo Carrillo, Raul
Ferrero Costa, president of the Lima Law Association, and Monsignor
Augusto Beuzeville Ferro, assistant bishop of Lima.
   Survivors of the alleged massacre made a formal denunciation
Thursday of an attack by army troops May 14 against Cayara, a town
of 1,500 people.
   The survivors said in a statement that army troops killed 47 men
between the ages of 15 and 62, including eight high school
students, their principal, the town's justice of peace and the
Cayara prefect, a position with duties similar to those of a police
chief.
   The statement said 51 other people were missing, including women
who had been raped by troops.
   Escobar said he visited Cayara Saturday with a coroner and his
assistants and had seen at least four burned homes. He said that
based on interviews with survivors he determined at least 20
villagers were killed by troops.
   Escobar said troops guarding the entrance to Cayara would not
let the autopsy team enter the town and would not give him
permission to dig up an area where survivors said dozens of victims
had been buried by troops.
   The four members of a congressional team also returned to
Ayacucho Sunday after visiting Cayara and told reporters they found
evidence of the slaying of at least 30 non-combatants.
   Gen. Cesar Valdivia, military commander of the Ayacucho region,
told reporters some 200 guerrillas had ambushed an army patrol two
miles outside Cayara the day before the alleged massacre.
   ``It is evident that a good proportion of the personnel that
participated in the ambush comes from the community of Cayara
because it is considered controlled by the terrorists,'' he said.
   The impoverished highlands surrounding this provincial capital
were the birthplace of the Shining Path insurgency eight years ago
this month and remain the stronghold of the Maoist guerrillas.
   The area has been under military control since late 1982.
   More than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence since
1980, most of them highland peasants caught in the crossfire
between guerrillas and security forces.
   In the two largest massacres on record, the Shining Path is
blamed for the slaughter of 83 peasants in 1983 and army troops for
the slaying of 69 villagers in 1985.

   An inmate took two guards hostage
Sunday night and then escaped in a prison jeep, briefly taking the
guards with him before meeting his wife in a getaway car,
authorities said.
   Michael Day, who was serving a sentence of 18 to 55 years at the
medium-security Ross Correctional Institution, left the guards at a
hotel then fled in a car with his wife and a child, said Todd
Bennett, a dispatcher at the State Highway Patrol's Chillicothe
post.
   Day, 31, was believed armed with a .25-caliber automatic gun,
Bennett said.
   Day apparently was assisted in the escape by his wife, Sylvia
Caraveo Day, 27, Bennett said. They were accompanied by a
9-year-old child, but the patrol did not know whether the child was
related to the Days.
   ``Apparently, they were in on it somehow,'' he said. ``They
picked him up somewhere.''
   Prison spokeswoman Sandy Price said the two guards were not
injured and were being questioned by patrol officials and prison
Superintendent Gary Mohr.
   Neither Price nor Bennett could say how Day took the guards
hostage or managed to escape.
   Day was convicted of attempted abduction, burglary, receiving
stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon after a felony
conviction, Ms. Price said. He had been at the Ross prison in this
southern Ohio city 50 miles south of Columbus since June 1987, she
said.
   He had served time at the Chillicothe Correctional Institute and
Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield since April 1985, Ms. Price
said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed
optimism in an interview published Sunday that he and President
Reagan will sign a treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons, and he
proposed a joint U.S.-Soviet trip to Mars.
   In a pre-summit interview with two American news organizations,
Gorbachev said his policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, includes
freedom of speech, but he condemned a leading dissident as a
``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on the democratic
process.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass ran a partial transcript of
Gorbachev's interview with the Washington Post and Newsweek, and
Radio Moscow's English-language foreign service carried a report
about it as its lead item Sunday.

   The confrontational tone of President Reagan's
pre-summit rhetoric apparently came as a surprise to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, even though the president has been using
similar anti-communist rhetoric for nearly four decades.
   Reagan takes to Moscow the view that the relationship between
the United States and the Soviet Union, no matter how gentlemanly
it becomes, is a conflict between good and evil.
   ``He is probably facing realities, what appear to him realities
now, but his likes and dislikes are probably the same as they were
all along,'' says Vladimir Petrov, professor emeritus of
international affairs at George Washington University.

   A dark cloud of controversy hangs over House
impeachment proceedings against federal judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami, giving some members of the Judiciary Committee's
investigative panel an uncomfortable case of election-year jitters.
   The panel is moving reluctantly and with great caution for two
reasons. One concerns the possibility of setting a historic
precedent. The other is the question whether in 1988, when a black
man is running for president, America is truly colorblind.
   The House has impeached 11 federal judges for ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in its 200-year history. Only five of them were

   Long-awaited new federal regulations to
overhaul Farmers Home Administration lending policies are expected
to cost taxpayers $8.7 billion and push as many as 65,000 farmers
into liquidation or foreclosure, according to the Agriculture
Department agency.
   The FmHA is often called the government's farm lender of last
resort because loans are made only to those who cannot qualify at
banks or other commercial sources. Overall, the agency's farm loan
portfolio totals around $26 billion to 250,000 borrowers.
   With loan delinquencies rising, FmHA was directed by Congress in
last year's Agricultural Credit Act to rewrite many of its
regulations so that borrowers would be given a greater opportunity
to restructure or spread out payments and still hold onto their
land.

<HEAD>Slow Sales, Rise of Personal Computers Threatens Minicomputer
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slumping sales, new kinds of software and more
powerful personal computers are forcing a gradual restructuring in
the nation's multibillion-dollar minicomputer industry, experts say.
   After a year of layoffs and slowdowns, minicomputer makers
clustered along the Route 128 beltway around Boston are refocusing
their marketing and production tactics and forming business
alliances considered taboo a short time ago.
   The main reason for the changes has been the advent of personal
computers that can do some minicomputer jobs for a lot less money.
   ``The focus of this business is PCs now,'' said John McCarthy of
Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, which tracks technology
management trends. ``That's what's creating the excitement. It's
not mainframes and it's not minicomputers.''
   Minicomputers _ which come as small as single-drawer filing
cabinets but do not sit on desks _ are used for heavy computation
in fields such as science and engineering, accounting, travel,
inventory management and office automation.
   In minicomputers, the central device is the brains of the system
while the terminals are ``dumb.'' With personal computers,
``intelligence'' is located in each computer.
   As processing capabilities of personal computers increase, price
is becoming a key factor separating minis and PCs. Today's standard
price range for minicomputers is $8,000 to $12,000 per user;
desktop PCs cost from $4,000 to $8,000.
   ``Minicomputer vendors don't understand how to achieve the same
price levels as PCs, yet they have no performance advantage to
offer,'' said Aaron Goldberg, vice president for minicomputer
services at International Data Corp. ``Of course the customers are
opting for the lower price alternative.''
   IDC, a market researcher, forecasts a 17 percent growth in U.S.
personal computer sales this year against 7 percent for
minicomputers. Sales of minicomputers totaled $13.8 billion in 1987
in the country, compared to $20.5 billion for personal computers.
   Instead of buying one minicomputer, many companies are linking
together personal computers through local area networks and then
using one common PC to store information, analysts said.
   Under the most dire predictions, minicomputer use may be
restricted to providing services for personal computer networks by
the mid-1990s.
   The first minicomputer company, Digital Equipment Corp., was
founded in 1957 in the corner of an old woolen mill. The
Maynard-based company grew into the world's second largest computer
maker after International Business Machines Corp.
   Other minicomputer makers that located in the high-tech corridor
outside Boston include Data General Corp. in Westboro, Wang
Laboratories Inc. in Lowell, Prime Computer Inc. in Natick and
Computer Consoles Inc. in Waltham.
   Business began to pick up in the early 1970s and surged through
1985, when an industrywide slump hit and the personal computer
began redefining the business.
   One scenario is that businesses will rely on large mainframes
for large computing needs and personal computers for deskwork _
leaving the mid-range minicomputers out in the cold. One industry
analyst forecast that about 65 percent of the market will opt for
the two-tiered approach.
   ``The costs are staggering in terms of what this could do,''
said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group,
``That's where the battle is going to be waged.''
   Digital Equipment, challenging IBM on its own mainframe turf,
has begun offering clusters of powerful minicomputers that add up
to nearly the power of a big mainframe.
   Minicomputer makers also are coming to grips with the emergence
of standard operating systems, which allow popular software
packages to be used on a variety of different computers.
   The most popular standard operating system is American Telephone
& Telegraph Co.'s Unix, a base layer of software in a computer that
serves as a traffic cop for its internal operations.
   The threat to large computer vendors is simple: Unix frees users
from being tied to a single proprietary software limited to a
particular computer. On the other hand, Unix is good for small
companies that want to steal business away from the likes of
Digital and IBM.
   For software makers, the move to Unix means the opportunity to
write programs applicable to many systems, and computer firms
already have begun signing distribution packages with software
houses.
   Wang Laboratories recently signed on to distribute software made
by Banyan Systems Inc. of Westboro which concentrates on personal
computers. Analysts predict similiar alliances as companies seek to
keep a presence in accounts that aren't buying minicomputers.
   Some minicomputer companies are falling back on market niches.
Wang Labs is focusing on the storage and manipulation of document
images. Prime, which recently bought neighboring Computervision
Corp. for $435 million, is focusing on computer-aided design and
manufacturing.
   Digital Equipment, too big to fit into a market niche, is
stressing its skills in creating computer networks rather than
focusing on the computers themselves.

<HEAD>Newspapers Turning to Soybean-Based Ink</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soybean-based ink developed just a year ago
is winning critical reviews at newspapers across the country and
industry experts say it could help farmers and cut dependence on
imported oil.
   ``I would predict that by 1995 the majority of U.S. newspapers
will use it for color and, if there's a petroleum crisis, I think
the switch-over will be 100 percent immediately,'' said Wilson
Cunningham, director of research at the Reston, Va.-based American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   About 500 of the nation's roughly 1,600 daily newspapers have
tested or are regularly using soy ink, Cunningham said. ``It's a
competitive product. It's not experimental anymore.''
   He said newspapers ranging from the Boston Globe to the Daily
Breeze of Torrance, Calif., now use soy ink exclusively for color
reproduction.
   ``We're pleased with it. We did a lot of testing and we don't
see ourselves going back,'' said Don O'Neill, the Globe's
production director.
   ``We're looking mainly at improving our quality,'' said Blake
Spence, pressroom manager of the Star Tribune. He said the
Minneapolis newspaper plans to start testing color soybean ink this
month.
   Besides providing more vivid color and print that's less likely
to rub off, soy ink brightens the economic prospects of farmers,
its promoters say. Moreover, biodegradable soy oil makes the ink
easier on the environment than traditional petroleum-based ink,
they say.
   When the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch begins everyday use of
soy-based color ink by month's end, it will join three Minnesota
agricultural journals that already have made the switch. The
product is now found on the pages of The Farmer, Agri News, a
weekly farm publication of the Rochester Post-Bulletin, and
Minnesota Agriculture.
   The ink's popularity is reflected by a huge increase in soy ink
sales.
   ``We're committed to making it a major portion of our
business,'' said Robert Brough, a marketing manager at General
Printing Ink in Carlstedt, N.J., the nation's largest manufacturer
of soybean ink.
   ``The main reason is that it's environmentally superior. But
besides that, it prints better and looks better,'' said Brough,
whose company, a division of Sun Chemical, developed the ink in
March 1987 using ANPA research.
   The company's Minnesota division processed 40 percent more of
the product in the first quarter of 1988 than it did in the final
three quarters of 1987, said sales representative Tom Hayes.
   ``It's just all of a sudden taking off,'' Hayes said.
   Cost is the catch when it comes to a commitment to black soy
ink. Color soy ink costs about the same as its petroleum
counterpart, but black soy ink costs twice as much as traditional
ink, says Minnesota Agriculture editor Jill Wheeler.
   That was no big drawback to Wheeler's magazine, which made its
soybean debut in its April 14th edition. Wheeler says it costs her
publication about $200 more a year ``which really isn't much. When
you consider all our readers are farmers, it really does mean a
lot.''
   But for a major paper printing millions of pages a day, the cost
of a complete move to soy ink remains intimidating, said production
officials at the two Twin Cities dailies.
   Tom Travis, pressroom manager at the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch, says soybean-based ink produced greater yield and
brighter printed images in his paper's color test runs.
   ``We were able to use less water and use less ink to get the
same density, the same...colors,'' Travis said. ``It looks as if it
could be economical.''
   Unlike traditional ink, soy ink is biodegradable and therefore
does not carry the hazardous waste classification the more common
ink does.
   Though it has yet to be classified as non-hazardous, soy ink's
boosters are hoping environmental officials soon will give it a
designation that will allow its disposal through the sewer system,
Hayes said.
   Research on soy ink began at the ANPA in the mid-1970s as a
result of the oil crisis, Cunningham said. The first ink to prove
successful was tested in August 1987 at The Cedar Rapids (Iowa)
Gazette, the Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald-Journal and the Syracuse
Post-Standard.
   The relative cost of soy ink promises to sink even lower with
increased sales. According to Hayes, an estimated 2.5 percent of
the U.S. soybean crop would be consumed if all the country's daily
newspapers made the switch.
   David Bohling, director of state relations for the American
Soybean Association, estimated some 100 million pounds of soy oil
will be used for newspaper ink this year.
   ``That may not be a large part of the total percentage of
soybean oil supply,'' said Wayne Bennett, the association's
president and a soybean farmer from Lonoke, Ark. ``But anytime you
talk about 3 percent of a 15 billion-pound supply, you're talking
about a significant customer.''
   The United States now produces about 75 percent of the world
soybean crop, Hayes says. Before ink, soy derivatives have long
been used in products ranging from baby formula to cooking oils to
vinyl floors.

<HEAD>Management Suffers Even If It Wins In Proxy Contests</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Proxy Fights, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Winning a proxy contest is no job guarantee for
current managers.
   According to an analysis of 60 proxy contests, management
resignations typically follow a proxy battle even when outsiders
fail to win seats on a company's board of directors, according to
two researchers at the University of Rochester.
   Professors Harry and Linda DeAngelo, who studied the contests
between 1978 and 1985, noted that about two-thirds of the time, top
managers resigned within three years of a proxy fight, with the
majority of the changes coming within one year.
   That includes managers who lost their jobs when disssident
shareholders won control of their companies, which happened about
30 percent of the time.
   Perhaps even more significant, the two found that only about 20
percent of the companies they studied remained publicly held
corporations run by the same management teams three years after the
proxy contests.
   Harry DeAngelo pointed to two examples:
   _Samuel B. Casey, president and chief executive officer of
Pullman Inc., resigned in November 1978 even though dissident
shareholders were defeated in a proxy fight. Two years later, the
company was acquired by Wheelabrator-Frye Inc.
   _In the case of Management Assistance, a group of dissident
shareholders backed by Asher Edelman won four out of 10 board seats
in an April 1984 proxy fight. Four months later, the company's
president and chief executive officer Raymond Kurshan resigned.
Within a year, the company was liquidated.
   The DeAngelos say their findings raise serious questions about
claims that proxy contests are an inefficient way to discipline
managers of publicly held corporations.
   In many cases of management resignations, the new manager is
designed to accommodate the dissidents' interest, Harry DeAngelo
said.
   ``These findings suggest that, independent of its immediate
outcome, a proxy challenge does pose a serious threat to managerial
tenure,'' the study said.

<HEAD>With AM-Proxy Fights, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The more proxy contests, and the grizzlier, the
more business booms for proxy solicitors.
   Solicitors are responsible for the gritty legwork in a proxy
battle. They track down shareholders and talk to them, draft
letters and write newspaper ads, send out mailings, tally votes,
and serve as general hand-holders to whichever side they happen to
represent.
   ``They've got it down to a science,'' one observer remarked.
   The Carter Organization, one of the largest solicitors with 1987
fee income of more than $22 million, has had a hand in several
major proxy fights recently.
   Donald Carter, the group's president, said the cost of a proxy
battle can range anywhere from $1 million to $10 million.
   Because a large precentage of any company's stock is held by
institutional investors or in street names _ names other than the
actual shareholder _ simply identifying just who owns the
outstanding shares is a job for a first-rate sleuth.
   At Georgeson & Co., the nation's oldest proxy solicitor,
managing director John Wilcox said he relies on a database that has
been built up over time linking individuals and their securities
holdings.
   Once shareholders are identified, solicitors have to convince
them to vote in a particular direction. Carter estimates his people
talk by phone with 2 million shareholders a year in an attempt to
influence voting.
   Some firms have even been known to hire actors to use Southern
accents in an attempt to sway shareholders in Southern states,
observers say.
   Carter said new technology allowing shareholders to vote by
phone has ``added a new dimension'' to solicitation. ``When we get
finished speaking with a shareholder, we give them a toll-free
number and ask them to call immediately if they agree with us,'' he
said.
   ``Within five minutes, we know if they're telling the truth that
they're going to vote with us.''
   If the shareholder doesn't call in with a vote, Carter's people
are back on the phone.
   Newspaper ads are also crucial to the proxy process, but they
are not directed toward the individual shareholder. Rather, they
are aimed at the investment community _ both large institutional
investors as well as brokers who may be asked for advice from
individual clients.
   Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Desert Partners L.P., said
solicitors are ``totally key to the entire process. They help
identify and contact shareholders, they give you their prognosis of
how the vote is stacking up and they make sure proxies are properly
executed so they don't get thrown out on a technicality.''
   Desert Partners sought seats on the board of USG Corp. in a
recent proxy contest. The partnership also launched a tender offer
for USG shares.
   As for the latest wave of proxy battles that has come to center
on large corporations, ``business is the busiest ever'' for
solicitors, Wilcox said.

   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh
arrived here Sunday, apparently to garner support for an oil
production cut in advance of June's meeting of the ministerial
council of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Aqazadeh, who also will visit the United Arab Emirates and
Indonesia, said Iran supported the proposal for an all-round cut in
output by oil producers from within and outside the 13-nation
international cartel.
   He also told Omani reporters that joint cuts ``could constitute
the nucleus for strong cooperation'' between the two blocs.
   Following his talks with his Omani counterpart, Ahmed Saeed
Al-Shanfari, the Omani news agency said talks dealt with the world
market situation and the outcome of last month's oil talks in
Vienna, Austria in quest of stabilizing world oil prices. But it
did not elaborate.
   Oman last month joined five other non-OPEC nations in offering a
5 percent cut in output provided OPEC also reduced its production
ceiling by an equal proportion. At a subsequent meeting in Vienna,
OPEC members could not agree on the proposal and further
discussions were deferred to the cartel's semi-annual meeting
starting June 8 in Vienna.
   Key opponents of the plan were Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
   Oman, which has cooperated with OPEC over the past two years in
reducing its output to help stabilize flagging oil prices, has
reversed the cuts temporarily and until the June meeting, according
to oil industry sources.

<HEAD>Upjohn Unveiling Big Japanese Research Lab Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co. is opening a new laboratory
in Japan in order to tap the world's second-largest drug market and
Japan's pharmaceutical research efforts, the drug-maker says.
   A 305,000 square-foot laboratory will be unveiled next month in
Skuba, Japan. It initially will employ about 100 people, and grow
to about 400 by 1995, according to Udo Axen, vice president in
charge of research and development for Upjohn in Japan.
   The laboratory will be the company's largest after its research
facility in Kalamazoo.
   The cost of the facility has nearly doubled from estimates in
1985, when the laboratory originally was announced, to about $100
million due to the Japanese yen's rise against the U.S. dollar.
   Upjohn officials have cited the quality of research in Japan as
one reason for opening the Skuba lab.
   ``Their (Japanese) level of scientific sophistication is equal
to that here or in Europe,'' said Jacob Stucki, corporate vice
president for pharmaceutical research. ``We know that there's a lot
of good stuff going on in Japan and we've got to bring it back
here.''
   The company already has established 10 research partnerships at
European universities and has a small laboratory in Crawly, England.
   ``One of the reasons for the big investment is that Japan is
producing new drugs as fast if not faster than we are in the United
States,'' said John G. Wagner, a professor of pharmaceutics at the
University of Michigan and part-time Upjohn consultant. ``I'm
impressed with the Japanese scientists as well. I'm impressed with
their research.''
   ``They are very innovative now in what they are doing,'' said
Charles Sweeley, a professor of biochemistry at Michigan State
University and also an Upjohn consultant. ``There was a time just
after World War II that they lagged behind in many areas of medical
research and seemed more to follow U.S. leads and mimic areas of
excitement in this country.''
   Upjohn also said it wanted to get into Japan because it is the
second-largest drug-consuming market in the world, after the United
States. Officials have said that is partly because physicians there
dispense as well as prescribe prescriptions.

<HEAD>China's Largest Oil Field Running At A Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's largest oil field, for many years touted
as the model for all industrial endeavors, is expected to run at a
loss this year for the first time, an official report said Sunday.
   The English-language China Daily quoted an unidentified official
at the Daqing Oilfield as saying the oilfield would run a deficit
this year of about $35.1 million.
   Daqing, in China's northeasternmost province of Heilongjiang,
produces half of China's crude oil and for the past 12 years pumped
more than 50 million tons annually.
   But rising production costs and the state's low purchase price
of crude oil now plague the oilfield, for many years the model
enterprise trumpeted in the slogan, ``In industry learn from
Daqing.''
   The 27-year-old oilfield employs more than 200,000 workers.
   Production cost per ton is now $15, more than three times the
figure a decade ago, the newspaper reported.
   Wells that once flowed with oil now must be motor pumped,
tripling production costs, it said.
   Output of old oil wells has been decreasing at a rate of 4
million tons annually, forcing the oilfield to drill more wells to
maintain its production level and adding to production costs.
   Since 1983, Daqing has obtained $1.087 billion in loans from the
World Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Japan to develop new
oilfields in the area.
   In response to rising production costs, the state decided to
raise its purchase price this year from $27 per ton to $29, but
Daqing officials said the increase would fall far short actual
costs. Purchase price on the world market is $135 a ton, the
newspaper said.
   Daqing officials also complained about tight central government
control that limits the oilfield's crude oil consumption to 800,000
tons annually and forbids it to handle any of its own sales.
   Officials said even allowing Daqing to handle 0.5 percent of its
sales would make a difference.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart To Pare Imported Products From Inventories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUTTGART, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has launched a
program aimed at reducing the amount of imported products in the
inventory of its discount store chain.
   Company officials will prepare a list of imports ``and all those
items with be fair game'' if the company opts to go with United
States manufacturers, according to Joe Chappelle, director of
Wal-Mart's newly-created USA Division.
   Chappelle said the Bentonville-based company, the nation's
third-largest general retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K
mart Corp., would ask for help from state industrial development
organizations in enlisting domestic manufacturers for the program.
   He said the company would provide the agencies with a list of
imported products sold at its stores, specifications on the
products and other information that will help them put Wal-Mart and
interested manufacturers in touch with each other.
   Chappelle said Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton was ``deeply
committed to the Buy America program,'' and that the company was
willing to take the risk of product specifications falling onto the
hands of competitors.
   The company has no idea how many imported products will be
replaced by domestic ones, and products will be studied on a
case-by case basis. No time frame was given for the program.
   Conversion of some labor-intensive products may be a problem
because of the difference in wages paid in the United States and
some foreign countries, Chappelle said.
   ``I'm not saying that it's impossible to convert labor-intensive
items because it may be that you would wind up getting more
value,'' he said.
   Chappelle also said small manufacturers should not shy away from
the program because of Wal-Mart's giant volume requirements.
   ``The volume can be shocking, but if a manufacturer only wants
to bid on a certain quantity, he can do that. He can get any part
of the pie he wants,'' he said.
   Wal-Mart stockholders are to discuss the program at a meeting
next month. A preview was given Friday in Stuttgart for
participants in the LeadAR program, an agricultural and rural
leadership development program sponsored by the University of
Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service.

<HEAD>USG Says Proxy Results A Defeat For Desert Partners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. declared victory Sunday in its proxy
battle with Desert Partners LP, saying a preliminary vote count
showed a management-backed slate of directors had defeated one
nominated by the investor group.
   But Desert Partners said it would continue pursuing its $2.2
billion hostile buyout offer for the building materials company,
and noted it had a pending lawsuit challenging the proxy vote.
   In the contest for six seats on the company's 15-member board of
directors, USG said the management-backed slate received
approximately 57 percent of the votes cast, according to a
preliminary count released by The Corporation Trust Co.
   The final results are to be announced Friday, the company said.
   The proxy vote conducted at the company's annual shareholders'
meeting on May 11 pitted a slate led by Desert Partners' two main
investors, Texas oilmen Jack E. Brown and Cyrus Wagner Jr., against
the USG slate that included three members of current management.
   Robert J. Day, USG chairman and chief executive officer, said
the victory reflected stockholders' confidence in the company's
board and management. He contended that 95 percent of individual
shareholder votes were cast for the management slate.
   ``We believe the overwhelming results of the vote is clearly a
mandate from the shareholders not to sell USG,'' Day said.
   Midland, Texas-based Desert Partners indicated its slate
received about 42 percent of the votes cast.
   Joel L. Reed, Desert Partners' chief financial officer, said he
was ``extremely pleased with the substantial support'' for the
group's slate and called on the USG board to promptly begin merger
negotiations.
   ``We think these results show...a large percentage of the
stockholders support Desert Partners efforts to acquire USG,'' Reed
said.
   He also said he believed Desert Partners enjoyed more support
among shareholders who bought USG stock after the March 15
eligibility date for the proxy vote.
   Frederic Spar, a spokesman for Desert Partners, said the
investors' group would press a lawsuit it filed before the
shareholders' meeting. The suit challenges the proxy vote on
grounds there were deficiencies in USG's disclosure of information
to shareholders about a management-backed recapitalization plan.
   Earlier this month, USG announced a defensive recapitalization
plan and business restructuring plan to counter Desert Partners'
hostile tender offer in March of $42 a share for 39 million USG
shares, or a 76 percent stake in the company. The Desert Partners'
bid is valued at about $2.2 billion.
   The USG plan, to be submitted to a shareholders' vote June 24,
would pay stockholders $37 in cash, debentures with a face value of
$5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each
of the 51.5 million common shares.
   USG closed at $43.87{ a share Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, up 25 cents.
   Desert Partners made a new proposal this month to acquire USG in
a negotiated transaction in which shareholders would receive $39
per share in cash, plus debentures and stock valued at about $11
per share, Spar said.
