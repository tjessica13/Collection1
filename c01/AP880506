   Vice President George Bush said Friday he didn't authorize
aides' comments depicting Edwin Meese III as a campaign liability
but ``I must say I am troubled by some of the allegations'' against
the attorney general, while Michael Dukakis pocketed the
endorsements of six Democratic governors as he moved toward his
party's nomination.
   Jesse Jackson, the only other active candidate in the 1988
presidential race, was in California as part of an intensive,
costly effort to ambush Dukakis in the June 7, season-ending
primary.
   He complained anew that he was not being treated fairly in the
party's delegate selection process, but added soothingly, ``We need
not speak in terms of a fight.''
   Bush took aim at both Democratic candidates as he addressed a
Republican dinner at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln on the
way home from three days of campaigning in the West.
   ``It's a pleasure to be here. And I'll be back,'' Bush told the
group. ``And I'm not going to be out-hustled by the hustler from
Chicago or from that traditional liberal Democrat from
Massachusetts.''
   It was a clear reference to the Jackson, who has a home in
Chicago, and Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts. Bush spokesman
Stephen Hart said the vice president ``was talking about how hard
he (Jackson) has hustled. It was nothing derogatory.''
   Early in the day, Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee,
told reporters he would have to ``get on the phone'' and find out
what two top aides said about the attorney general, whose conduct
is being investigated by a special prosecutor.
   ``I haven't authorized anything,'' the vice president added as
he campaigned in Idaho.
   Later, in Billings, Mont., Bush said he had talked to the aides
but would not characterize his conversation. Of Meese, Bush said:
``I know him well, favorably, but I must say I am troubled by some
of the allegations. I think fair play dictates that the system go
forward and make the determination.''
   When asked if Meese had become an albatross on his campaign,
Bush said: ``An albatross? I don't think so.''
   He added that the independent counsel probing Meese's legal
difficulties soon will release a report and ``we'll see what it
says. It's only a matter of a few days away.''
   The comments of the Bush aides were reported in the Detroit
News, the latest development in an ethical controversy that has
provided Democrats with campaign ammunition and turned Meese into a
political embarrassment in the eyes of some Republican strategists.
   The paper, in a story published earlier in the day, said Peter
Teeley, Bush's communications director, and Robert Teeter, a senior
campaign adviser, made the comments in interviews this week in
Washington.
   ``Meese is a liability,'' Teeley was quoted as saying.
   ``What a guy like Meese does is take away the opportunity to
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss,'' Teeley told
the newspaper. ``I mean, you are consistently asked about Meese's
problems, how you deal with it, how you stand, one thing or
another, and that just totally diverts attention from the message
that you are trying to get across.''
   ``All things considered, you would rather not have that problem
going on right now,'' Teeter was reported to have said. ``No one is
arguing that it is a plus to have that situation going on over
there.''
   Meese denies any wrongdoing and says he doesn't intend to
resign, and Bush has never urged him to do so.
   Democratic front-runner Dukakis dropped off the campaign trail
for several days, divided between his statehouse office in Boston
and a private weeekend with his wife Kitty.
   But he won the support of the half-dozen governors, mostly in
the West, in a fresh sign that the Democratic Party is coalescing
behind his candidacy despite Jackson's persistent challenge.
   ``Gov. Dukakis has emerged as the voters' choice, the clear
leader in the Democratic nomination process,'' said Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton, described as the leader in the effort to round up the
gubernatorial support that was announced during the day. ``It is
time for the party leadership to unite behind his candidacy,'' he
said.
   Other than Clinton, the governors adding their endorsements _
and their votes as delegates to the Democratic National Convention
_ were Govs. Cecil Andrus of Idaho, Steve Cowper of Alaska, Ted
Schwinden of Montana, George Sinner of North Dakota and Michael
Sullivan of Wyoming.
   Clinton said Friday that he had ``agreed to try to put together
a number of governors, as many as were willing to come out and
endorse,'' before the Michigan caucuses March 26. But, he added,
``Governor Dukakis felt that, after Michigan, which he lost, that
none of us should look as if'' they were involved in any effort to
stop Jackson, who won in Michigan.
   Thus, Clinton said, he and the other five governors withheld
their endorsement until now to avoid the appearance of a
stop-Jackson movement.
   ``I was very impressed that Governor Dukakis and his campaign
felt strongly enough, were sensitive enough, that they actually
asked people to hold off for weeks and weeks on endorsement. I
think it shows a lot of maturity and a real determination to unify
the party,'' Clinton said.
   Dukakis' aides said they expected additional endorsements from
governors in the next several days, possibly including Oregon's
Neil Goldschmidt.
   While the Massachusetts governor solidified his position at the
top of the ticket, backstage maneuvering continued over the vice
presidential slot.
   Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, a former astronaut who failed in his
effort to win the 1984 presidential nomination, signaled he was
available if Dukakis wanted him. He said he would be glad to ``sit
down and discuss it'' but added he was not campaigning for the job.
   Dukakis has slightly more than 1,500 delegates in The Associated
Press delegate count, with 2,081 needed to clinch the nomination.
Jackson has fewer than 1,000.
   Jackson took note of the delegate deficit he faces and said he
was fighting the ``press and pundits, the party, the candidate. ...
It's not just me and him,'' he said of Dukakis. ``It's me and
them.''
   He had suggested on Thursday that his supporters' backing of the
eventual nominee could wax or wane depending on how he was treated
in the allocation of convention ``super delegates.'' He said
Friday, ``We need not speak in terms of a fight. ... We will make
our appeals to the appropriate places.''

   A Norwegian airliner crashed Friday night on
a domestic flight, killing all 36 people on board, the national NRK
broadcasting company reported.
   The television station said the plane crashed about 9 miles
southwest of its destination, the Norwegian Sea coastal town of
Broennoeysund, about 375 miles north of Oslo. All those aboard were
believed to be Norwegian, it said.
   The four-engine Wideroe Airline plane, carrying 33 passengers
and three crew members, was flying north from Namsos to
Broennoeysund, a distance of about 75 miles.
   ``The control tower at Broennoeysund airport lost contact with
the plane about five minutes before its scheduled landing at 8:35
p.m. (2:35 p.m. EDT),'' the broadcast said.
   Rescue work was coordinated by police and the rescue center in
the city of Bodoe just north of the Arctic Circle.
   ``Rescue personnel and four doctors reaching the crash site by
helicopters reported soon after 11 p.m. (5 p.m. EDT) that there was
no sign of survivors,'' Bodoe police chief Olav Soenderland said on
the television newscast.
   ``They reported that there was still fire and small explosions
in the severely damaged main fuselage and in debris spred around in
rough terrain,'' Soenderland said.
   The plane was a turbo-prop Dash-7.
   The national NTB news agency reported that the crash site was
about 330 feet above sea level near 890-foot-high Torghatten
mountain, which is well-known in Norway because it is shaped like a
hat and has a hole through the middle section.
   Soenderland said there were low clouds and poor visibility in
the vicinity of Broennoeysund on Friday night.
   A representative of the federal Airplane Crash Commission is to
fly to the crash site Saturday to begin an investigation.
   The crash was one of the worst in Norway since World War II.
   Forty people were killed in a domestic Braathen SAFE airline
that crashed just west of Oslo on Dec. 23, 1972.

   A grand jury Friday refused to indict a
former small-town police chief on murder charges in the 1978
slaying of his wife's first husband, whose body was found buried in
the chief's yard in March.
   Robert Chambers, 36, ``at this point is no longer under
charges,'' Assistant Attorney General Gregory Swope said in
announcing the grand jury decision. The prosecutor gave no
explanation for the action.
   Chambers was arrested and charged with murder April 15 in the
slaying of 25-year-old Russell Bean, a friend and drinking buddy's
of Chambers.
   Chambers resigned as part-time police chief of Marlow, a town of
about 600 near the Massachusetts and Vermont borders in the
southwestern corner of the state, after state police dug up the
body from Chambers' front yard March 14.
   ``The case is back to square one,'' Swope said. ``It's as if
he'd never been arrested and we're still investigating.'' He said
new charges against Chambers ``would only be warranted if there
were some developments in the case.''
   ``I feel real fine,'' Chambers said by telephone from a friend's
home Friday night. He declined to answer any other questions.
   Police began digging up Chambers' yard after Chambers'
relatives, relaying a story told them by Chambers' father shortly
before his death March 9, told authorities Chambers had
accidentally killed Bean in a fight.
   The relatives said that Chambers' father, Clifton, told them he
helped his son bury the body. According to court papers, the
relatives said that the elder Chambers, 61 when he died, had told
them not to say anything until after his death.
   Relatives alleged in court papers that Chambers and Bean had
swapped wives, allegations denied by Chambers' current wife, Sylvia
Chambers.
   Chambers moved out of his house after Bean's body was found, and
his wife filed for divorce.
   Chambers was held at the Cheshire County jail until Thursday,
when three people signed over property to allow him to make bail of
$75,000 cash and $75,000 property.
   Mark Sisti, Chambers' lawyer, commended prosecutors, saying they
handled the case professionally. ``They really threw a fair shot at
the grand jury,'' he said.
   After Bean disappeared in 1978, his wife, Sylvia, married
Chambers, who had divorced his wife, Deborah. Pathologists
determined that Bean had been beaten in the head and chest.

<DATELINE>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abdala Bucaram, a fiery populist
leader from this rough-and-tumble port, is given a chance of
winning Ecuador's presidency even though the Roman Catholic Church,
newspapers and others object to his raucous style and language.
   The prospect that Bucaram, leader of the populist Roldosista
Party, could win the presidential runoff election Sunday has
stirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors through
Ecuador's financial circles.
   The military sent him fleeing into exile once before.
   His foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in his
speeches. But Bucaram's response is that he is a champion of the
poor.
   Campaigning recently in Guayaquil's steamy heat with his shirt
tail hanging out, he called himself a ``good-hearted slob'' and
admits he may be a bit ``crazy.''
   But his opponent in the election, Rodrigo Borja, is taking
Bucaram's challenge seriously.
   Political analysts say Bucaram has a good chance of defeating
Borja, a Social Democrat and leader of the Democratic Left party,
in the runoff.
   In the first round Jan. 31, the 36-year-old Bucaram won second
place in a field of 10 candidates with 15.3 percent of the vote to
20.3 percent for the 52-year-old Borja, 52.
   The winner Sunday will replace Leon Febres Cordero, a staunchly
conservative, pro-U.S. political leader whose four-year term ends
in August.
   This nation of 10 million people, wedged between Colombia and
Peru, has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems
and political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputes
between Febres Cordero and left-leaning parties that control
Congress.
   Borja, who narrowly lost to Febres Cordero in a runoff in 1984,
has pledged to reverse the current government's free-market
economic policies and seek close ties with the Non-Aligned
Movement, also known as the Third World.
   Borja's party is Ecuador's largest, but his chances are
weakened, many analysts say, because he is viewed as a lackluster
speaker without strong leadership ability.
   Bucaram, who wears a Hitler-style mustache and says he is an
admirer of the Nazi leader's ``organizational genius,'' charged at
one point in the campaign that ``an international Jewish
conspiracy'' was against him.
   Catholic Church leaders and newspapers have assailed Bucaram for
his use of gutter-language in attacks on Borja. Bucaram has called
Borja a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews. He also
has used unprintable street language to question his foe's virility.
   ``Borja lacks strength, spirit,'' Bucaram said. ``He's a
lukewarm man. Abdala is different,'' he said of himself. ``He
awakens passions. There is no middle ground with him.''
   The attacks have prompted Borja, a calm, urbane lawyer, to
respond in kind, calling Bucaram an ``irresponsible clown'' and a
``fascist ignoramus.''
   ``I have been accused of everything in my political career from
narcotics trafficker to thief,'' Bucaram said in a midnight
interview outside his small third-floor walkup apartment on a
garbage-littered downtown street.
   Bucaram has pledged to ``punish the oligarchy'' and crack down
on wealthy tax evaders who, he charges, cheat the government of up
to $500 million a year.
   ``A vote for me is the same as scratching a Mercedes Benz with a
bottle cap,'' he told a cheering slum crowd, alluding to such an
act as defiance of the rich.
   He has promised a ``shoe bank'' to provide free shoes for all
poor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum
wage to $60.
   His foes call him a demagogue for making such promises but
acknowledge privately that Bucaram is following in Ecuador's
tradition of populist leaders.
   The late Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra won the presidency five
times, in good measure because of his inflammatory populist
rhetoric. He also was ousted four times in military coups.
   Bucaram was mayor of this city of 1.5 million people when he
fled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge of
slandering the armed forces, a criminal offense in Ecuador. He had
said all the military was good for was wasting money on parades.
   In Panama he was arrested on a charge of possessing five pounds
of cocaine. He claimed it was a frame-up arranged by Febres
Cordero, a political enemy.
   Ecuador's Congress granted him amnesty on the military offense
and pressured Panama into dropping the cocaine charge.
   He returned in August 1987 to a hero's welcome from his
followers in Guayaquil's shantytowns.
   Bucaram is heir to a political dynasty of Lebanese immigrants
who settled in Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city and its commercial
hub. His sister, Elsa, was elected mayor of Guayaquil in the
general elections this past January.
   Even political foes say Bucaram was successful in administering
Guayaquil, a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for many
mayors.
   He won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by paving
streets, piping in drinking water and providing other essential
services.
   He cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean by
jailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday told a jury to get some
rest and return Monday to resume efforts to break a stalemate in
the nation's first death-by-product-tampering case.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer refused to declare a mistrial
in the case of Stella Nickell despite a note from the foreman that
the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict after four days of
deliberation.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of suburban Auburn, is accused of killing her
husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and Sue Katherine Snow, 40, also of
Auburn, with cyanide-laced Excedrin capsules in 1986.
   During the ensuing scare, three bottles containing tainted pain
relief capsules also were found on store shelves in and near
Auburn, and Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its
over-the-counter drug capsules.
   Mrs. Nickell is charged with two counts of causing death by
product tampering and three of tampering. The death counts carry a
maximum sentence of life in prison; the maximum penalty for
tampering is 10 years.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne Maida charged that Mrs. Nickell
decided to end her marriage and money woes by killing her husband
and collecting as much as $176,000 in life insurance.
   Mrs. Nickell then placed more tainted capsules in stores to give
the appearance of random tampering, the prosecutor said. Ms. Snow
was an innocent stranger caught in the scheme, Ms. Maida said.

   Five missing Contra officials said in a letter
written before their disappearance that they would hold the rebels'
military chief responsible for any attack on them, a family member
said Thursday.
   Some of the five men had accused Contra leader Col. Enrique
Bermudez of corruption and had charged that he surrounded himself
with supporters of deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza
Debayle.
   The five were rounded up at their hotel in Honduras on Tuesday
by Honduran security police, said Marsha Lacayo, wife of missing
Contra military adviser Donald Lacayo.
   The men, some of whom spoke to their wives at the Honduran
security police headquarters after their arrest, said they expected
to be expelled from the country Thursday. But they failed to show
up at the airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa and their
whereabouts are unknown, Mrs. Lacayo said in Miami on Thursday
night.
   The men had written a letter on April 16 blaming Bermudez in
advance for ``any attack on our lives, damages, injuries or
deaths,'' said Mrs. Lacayo.
   The letter was to be opened in case anything happened to any of
the signees, she said.
   ``There is no doubt that Bermudez is responsible,'' said Mrs.
Lacayo.
   At a news conference in Washington on Thursday morning, Bermudez
denied having any information about the whereabouts of the missing
Contras.
   Bermudez, a former colonel of Somoza's hated National Guard, has
been at the center of a bitter power struggle within Contra ranks
for several weeks.
   Adolfo Calero, one of the five directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, a Contra umbrella group, reportedly agreed with the
dissidents that Bermudez should be removed, in part because he has
opposed parts of the peace agreement with the leftist Sandinista
goverment.
   Calero tried to persuade the four other directors to remove
Bermudez, but the leaders deadlocked.
   One of the five men detained is Enrique Sanchez, brother of
Contra director Aristides Sanchez, according to Mrs. Lacayo.
Enrique Sanchez, like Lacayo, was a civilian aide to the Contra
military forces.
   The other detainees were Walter Calderon Lopez, known as
Commander Tono, Tirzo Ramon Moreno, known as Commander Rigoberto,
Alejandro Montealegre, and a rebel pilot identified only as Waikita.
   One commander, Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, also known as
Fernando, escaped detention when the others were arrested and is in
hiding, Mrs. Lacayo said. Until January, Fernando was Bermudez's
personnel assistant.

   A locomotive rammed the back of an NJ

least 20 people were injured, one critically.
   The train was waiting for a signal to cross a bridge when it was
hit by a work engine traveling about 10 mph, said Rose Sheridan, a
spokeswoman for NJ Transit.
   Most of the injuries were to passengers in the last of six
passenger cars on the commuter train heading from Bayhead Junction
to New York, Ms. Sheridan said.
   The passengers suffered mainly neck and back injuries, said Ms.
Sheridan.
   There was no derailment, she said.
   NJ Transit investigators will interview the locomotive driver to
determine the cause of the accident, Ms. Sheridan said.
   Anthony Buccella, 24, of Point Pleasant, was listed in critical
condition at South Amboy Memorial Hospital. Two other passengers
were admitted for observation and listed in good condition.
   The other injured passengers were treated at hospitals and
released.

<HEAD>Freed French Hostage Says U.S. Hostages Brutalized After Escape
Try</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A journalist freed with two other Frenchmen this
week spoke of degrading treatment during their three years as
hostages in Lebanon, but said the really brutal treatment was
reserved for Americans who tried to escape.
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, a reporter for the weekly Evenement du
Jeudi, recently shared a cell with American educator Frank Herbert
Reed, who was ``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate,''
Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin, was quoted as saying by
Agence France-Presse.
   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when he
was kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986.
   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her the
American hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group
Islamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried to
escape.''
   The dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified which
hostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.
   Kauffmann, who was abducted May 22, 1985, was freed in Beirut on
Wednesday with French diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine,
who were kidnapped that same year. All three arrived back in Paris
on Thursday.
   In his own interview Friday with AFP, Kauffmann said the
remaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``my main concern. I ask
their families to remain patient and stay confident.''
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners still missing in Lebanon.
Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was seized March 16, 1985.
   AFP quoted Kauffmann as saying the Moslems holding foreign
hostages often degraded their captives and ``took everything away
from us, even our first names. ... Some of our jailers were very
human, but in a very hard context ... The best alternated with the
worst for reasons that escaped us.''
   He said the kidnappers gave each of the three French hostages a
new name _ Habib for Carton, Najib for Fontaine, Labib for
Kauffmann, AFP reported.
   Kauffmann identified Abu Ali as a particularly cruel guard, the
French agency said.
   ``He left us in filth, because for him we were impure. He
continued to humiliate us, not to mention a mock execution in June
1987 which was particularly frightening,'' the French reporter was
quoted as saying.
   AFP quoted the journalist as saying he was moved 18 times during
his years of captivity, and once was bound up like a mummy, put in
a sort of coffin under the bed of a truck and warned to stay silent
or he would be executed.
   Kauffmann was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``War and
Peace'' 21 times during his captivity.
   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac on Friday condemned those
who ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran for the
Frenchmen's freedom.
   Chirac, who faces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand in a
presidential runoff election Sunday, said, ``I say solemnly, I say
on my honor, that no negotiation, no compromise, no bargaining, no
deal took place with any foreign government, or even less with any
terrorist group.'' .
   AFP, citing unidentified sources it said were close to French
negotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resume formal
diplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning the day the
hostages were freed.
   France confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billion loan
Iran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports have said
the remainder was being paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,
Carton and Fontaine.
   Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying in her interview that she
learned from her brother that Fontaine was briefly held with Terry
Waite, the special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waite
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while in Lebanon to seek the hostages'
release.
   Kauffmann, Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying, ``found no excuse
for his kidnappers, for whom he feels only hate.''

   A man who prosecutors said was obsessed
with a bank teller was convicted of attempted murder Thursday in
the spear-gun shooting of her husband.
   Robert W. Freemyer Jr., 31, of Upper Saddle River admitted
firing the spear that hit Robert Jablonski in 1987 but said it was
an accident. The spear struck Jablonski in the back of the head but
left only a large bump.
   Authorities said Freemyer plotted to murder Jablonski because he
was obsessed with Jablonski's wife, Elizabeth.
   ``He looked at her every day. He brought strange gifts to her
parents' house. He spent a month (drawing) a picture for a woman he
barely knew,'' Bergen County Assistant Prosecutor Sharyn Peiffer
argued Tuesday.
   Defense attorney Vincent W. Basile said Jablonski was shot
during a ``chance meeting'' with Freemyer.
   Freemyer could receive 10 to 20 years in prison at sentencing.
   Basile said he will appeal.

   ``It's all right with me,'' said Jim Wright,
the House Speaker and Texas Democrat. ``I`m glad he consults
somebody.''
   Tongue firmly in cheek, Wright was referring to President
Reagan's newly divulged fascination with astroloy, which history
says Hitler and Julius Caesar also used in planning their strategy.
   Since these three leaders had very diverse aims, it's impossible
to make a judgment whether heeding the position of the planets is a
good or bad influence.
   For sure, though, nearly everyone wants to know how Presidents
make their decisions. Wives often are suspected of having undue
influence. Or a chief of staff. Or poker-playing cronies. Or a
``kitchen Cabinet.''
   Suspecting wives of undue influence is not necessarily an
expression of sexism. Since unlike vice presidents, they are not
elected, the suspicion usually carries a suggestion of a ``glitch''
in the democratic process.
   The same is true of chiefs of staff and friends of presidents.
   Sherman Adams is supposed to have done a lot more than keep
administrative order in the White House for Dwight D. Eisenhower,
although the revisionist view is that Ike really was running things.
   Critics of Andrew Jackson, 160 years ago, questioned his
practice of sitting around the kitchen stove with old friends and
swapping ideas with them. The critics probably did not care much
for this first common-man president anyhow.
   Curiously, in the case of Jimmy Carter, the critics wished he
consulted more with Washington wise men instead of old friends from
Georgia. Toward the end, Carter turned more to people like Clark
Clifford and Lloyd Cutler. So the critics found other things to
complain about.
   Vice Presidents, on the other hand, generally are not considered
all that useful to the man in the White House.
   Two in recent history, John Nance Garner and Lyndon B. Johnson,
were credited with getting their running mates elected.
   Garner swung the Texas delegation behind Franklin D. Roosevelt,
while Johnson is credited with winning Texas, and the presidency,
for John F. Kennedy.
   Otherwise, Presidents tend to look elsewhere for advice.
   Like to the stars.
   And that raises questions in an age that prizes reason and
science.
   Sixty-two years ago, when it turned out President Calvin
Coolidge had a yen for astrology, Congress held a hearing.
   Harry Houdini, the renowned escape artist, was called as a
witness.
   The results of the hearing are lost in history.
   But Reagan's fascination with Coolidge is well-known. Reagan
replaced Harry Truman's picture in the Cabinet Room with one of
Coolidge, the former Boston police commissioner who made
presidential inaction an art form.
   What did astrology do for Reagan?
   According to one unverified account, the treaty banning U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles was signed exactly at
1:33 p.m. last Dec. 8 at the insistence of Mrs. Reagan, who
evidently also fancies astrology.
   Her influence on the President has been a matter of persistent
speculation inside the Beltway ever since the Reagans moved into
the White House more than seven years ago.
   It may be no coincidence that the astrology story originates
with Donald Regan, the former White House chief of staff whose
relations with Mrs. Reagan were not considered very warm.
   Rosalyn Carter was supposed to have great influence on her
husband, Jimmy, although few doubted he had strong convictions of
his own.
   Critics of Roosevelt often suggested Eleanor, his wife, steered
him along liberal lines.
   And after Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke, his wife Edith, was
supposed to have played a leading role in presidential
decision-making.
   In fact, the only president never accused of being the target of
wifely inlfuence on his political career was James Buchanan. He
also was the only bachelor president.
   What motivates Reagan _ for instance in making a speech accusing
the Soviets of aggression and another two weeks later praising
their human rights reforms? Maybe Mrs. Reagan, the stars, his own
convictions and sense of history.
   It's hard to say.

   Teamsters President Jackie Presser,
hospitalized for a new round of cancer treatments, is taking a
leave of absence from his job just two months before his scheduled
trial on racketeering and embezzlement charges.
   Presser, 61, has told the 20 other members of the union's
executive board that he ``will be temporarily unavailable for the
next 120 days'' because of his health, his attorney, John Climaco,
said Thursday.
   Climaco said Presser is hospitalized at the Cleveland Clinic in
Ohio where he is undergoing a new round of radiation treatments.
   ``During the periods of his treatments and for a period of time
afterwards, he has been advised to rest and avoid all forms of
stress,'' the attorney said.
   Union officials declined to describe Presser's condition further.
   The rotund Teamsters president underwent surgery in January 1987
for lung cancer and has not returned to work full time since then
while undergoing a series of radiation and chemotherapy treatments.
   However, he has made several appearances at various union
functions, including the AFL-CIO's convention last October at which
he gave a rambling speech on the Teamsters' reaffiliation with the
labor federation after a 30-year absence.
   The 1.6 million-member union will be directed during Presser's
leave by Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L. Mathis, regarded as a
possible successor to the Teamsters presidency, union officials
said.
   Presser is expected to keep receiving his salary in various
union positions _ now about $600,000 annually, the officials said.
   When asked if Presser would seek another delay of his trial on
federal charges in connection with an alleged payroll-padding
scheme at a Teamsters local in Cleveland that he also heads,
Climaco answered ``not necessarily.''
   The trial, already postponed several times because of Presser's
health, is scheduled to open in U.S. District Court in Cleveland on
July 12.
   ``Mr. Presser is looking forward to his July trial and hopes he
will be physically able to stand trial so that he can once and for
all vindicate himself,'' the lawyer said.
   Presser is accused of participating in a scheme in which two men
with alleged organized crime ties were placed on the Cleveland
local's payroll at a cost of $700,000 over several years while
performing no work for the union.
   He has pleaded innocent. His attorneys contend that the FBI
acquiesced in and encouraged the continued employment of the two
men while it used Presser as a government informant.
   Presser was elevated to the Teamsters presidency in 1983 after
his predecessor, Roy Williams, was convicted of conspiring to offer
a bribe to former U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., in an effort
defeat legislation deregulating the trucking industry.
   Williams is now serving a 10-year prison sentence.

<HEAD>Sawyer Fires Cokely For Making Racist Remarks</HEAD>

from Cokely. DELETES outdated last graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer fired a top aide Thursday for
alleged racist and anti-Semitic remarks, ending a five-day furor.
   ``As mayor, I will not tolerate any racial divisiveness from any
employee,'' Sawyer said in announcing the dismissal of Steve Cokely
from his $35,000-a-year job as special projects coordinator.
   Sawyer said he would call a conference of community and
religious leaders to ``heal our wounds.''
   At issue were statements Cokely made in a series of lectures
from 1985 through 1987. They were tape-recorded and made available
for sale at a store run by followers of Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan.
   In the lectures, Cokely, who like the mayor is black, had said
doctors, ``especially Jewish ones,'' were infecting blacks with
AIDS and other diseases.
   He called Christopher Columbus a ``Hispanic Jew'' who brought
slaves to America and called Columbus Day a ``white supremacist
holiday.'' Cokely also labeled the Christian cross a ``symbol of
white supremacy.''
   The 35-year-old aide, whose remarks were made public in weekend
newspaper reports, apologized Monday, and Sawyer said then he had a
talk with the aide to ``rehabilitate Steve.''
   Cokely's firing followed mounting pressure on Sawyer from City
Council and community groups, who said they were outraged by the
remarks. The mayor said he acted after consulting with a
``broadly-based, multiracial group.''
   ``I'm sensitive, and I heard from a lot of people, and I took
time to work through the process,'' he said.
   Calls to Cokely's home and office went unanswered. At a rally
Thursday night attended by about 150 cheering supporters, Cokely
said: ``There was a plot to force me to resign. There were some
people who didn't like Steve Cokely. ... Some of them thought I
wanted their jobs.''
   Mayoral aide Monroe Anderson described Cokely as ``a gofer'' for
the mayor who ``goes to groups in the black community, listens,
sometimes talks and then reports to the mayor about the concerns of
those groups.''
   The regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai
B'rith issued a statement saying he welcomed the Cokely's dismissal.
   ``There is no place in government for any individual who
promoted such fear-mongering, bigotry-laced attitudes as the
conspiracy-haunted views of Steve Cokely,'' Michael Kotzin said.
   About 50 Cokely supporters demonstrated outside the mayor's
office before the news conference at which the firing was announced.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Versed Was Improperly Marketed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A new sedative that was touted as a superior
substitute for Valium was marketed in doses that were too strong
and sometimes fatal, doctors told a House panel examining the drug
Versed.
   ``It's a wonderful drug when it works, but the risks are too
great,'' plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Morrisey told the House
Government Operations subcommittee on human resources.
   Morisey, who said a patient of his died after receiving the
drug, said Thursday that doctors are shying away from Versed
because of the risks. ``The drug is basically out of their
control,'' he said.
   Versed, sold in the United States since March 1986, is used
intravenously for both full anesthesia and ``conscious sedation''
for diagnostic procedures often performed in a doctor's office.
   The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of 42
deaths associated with Versed, but doctors and an FDA official said
the actual count is probably higher.
   The maker of the drug, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., declined to
testify at the hearing. But Dr. Bruce Medd, its vice president and
director of professional services, in a telephone interview
defended Versed.
   ``Fifteen million people have gotten Versed since March 1986,''
Medd said. ``If this was a major problem, we would certainly be
talking about more than 42 fatalities.''
   The doctors at the hearing complained that Versed was marketed
here at doses two to three times as high as in Britain despite
existing studies that showed the lower doses were safe and
effective.
   ``The Europeans were light-years ahead of us'' in understanding
that Versed is much stronger than Valium, said Dr. Robert Julien, a
Portland, Ore. anesthesiologist.
   Dr. Alan Lisbon, an anesthesia professor at Harvard Medical
School, said six studies showing that low doses were effective were
published before the FDA approved Versed. He said the FDA didn't
use them but Britain did in setting its lower dose level.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, called the
initial U.S. dose levels ``dangerously excessive'' and criticized
the FDA for failing to review all scientific literature before it
approved the drug.
   He also charged that Hoffmann-La Roche did not promptly report
to the FDA important safety-related information, including deaths
associated with the drug, that could have led to quick revision of
the recommended dose.
   ``Unfortunately, it appears that many of the safety problems
presented by Versed were preventable,'' Weiss said.
   A statement issued by New Jersey-based Hoffmann-LaRoche said all
the allegations against it would prove unfounded, and said it had
complied with all regulations on reporting of information to the
FDA.
   Dr. Carlton Peck, director of the FDA's Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research, said the FDA had responsibly evaluated the
data on Versed and acted promptly in response to reports of adverse
reactions. He said he was not aware of any information withheld by
the manufacturer.
   As for the testimony of the doctors, Peck commented: ``I can't
make any assessment of its credibility. ... There's a lot of
opinion and a sizable amount of hearsay being expressed.''
   Some of the doctors said the drug's packaging and recommended
doses were intended to make it seem comparable to Valium, although
the manufacturer already knew it was up to four times as strong.
   They said revised dosage information was delayed and then buried
in obscure materials. They also complained that the drug had no
margin of safety _ that an extra milligram could send a mildly
sedated patient into a coma.
   Advertising as far back as October 1986 noted the revised
potency level, Medd said. But the FDA did not approve revised
labeling until May 1987 and doctors did not receive a red-flagged
letter about lower dose levels until November 1987.
   ``That got my attention, but it was too late,'' said Dr. Douglas
Walta of Portland, Ore. He said one of his patients died during a
kidney exam last May.

   Alaska is the pacesetter and South Dakota
brings up the rear when it comes to salaries for public school
teachers, the National Education Association says.
   Classroom teachers now earn an average of $28,031 nationally,
the union said Thursday, with salaries ranging from $40,424 in
Alaska down to $19,750 in South Dakota.
   Alaska is one of nine states, plus the District of Columbia,
where the typical teacher earns more than $30,000 a year. Only
South Dakota fell below $20,000.
   The average classroom teacher, with 15 years of experience, got
a 5.6 percent pay raise last year that boosted his or her salary by
$1,477 from the 1986-87 level of $26,554.
   The roster of top-paying states includes such populous ones as
New York, California and Michigan, and that will help push the
national average teacher salary closer to $30,000 in the year ahead.
   The teachers group did not estimate how much salaries will rise
this fall, but if teachers get another 5.6 percent increase, they
will be earning $29,600 for the 1988-89 school year.
   Teacher salaries have risen sharply in the 1980s amid widespread
concern about lagging standards in the classroom and waning
interest among college students in entering the profession.
Recently, however, with starting salaries topping $20,000 in some
places, interest in teaching has picked up.
   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, in a critique last
week on the impact of school reforms, said teacher salaries have
risen 20 percent after adjusting for inflation since 1980-81.
   But the NEA said that over the past decade, including the steep
inflation years of the late 1970s, teacher salaries are up only 7.3
percent after inflation.
   The union said there are 2,275,209 classroom teachers in the
public schools, 25,251 more than in 1986-87.
   The entire instructional staff, including principals,
supervisors and specialists, numbered 2,589,148. That was up by
30,190, or 1.2 percent. The average salary for all instructors was
$29,203, up 5.3 percent from $27,722 last year.
   Most teachers work on nine- or 10-month contracts.
   Eighteen states and the District of Columbia pay teachers more
than the national average; 32 states pay less.
   NEA researchers said the $28,031 figure is an estimate based on
salary data compiled from all 50 state.
   Although only an estimate, the NEA salary figure is widely
cited, including by the U.S. Department of Education, as the most
accurate indicator of how much school teachers earn. It includes
salaries of teachers represented by the rival American Federation
of Teachers as well those represented by NEA.
   The NEA gave this breakdown of average salaries and pay
increases for classroom teachers since 1977-78, when salaries
averaged $14,198:
   1978-79: $15,032, 5.9 percent.
   1979-80: $15,970, 6.2 percent.
   1980-81: $17,644, 10.5 percent.
   1981-82: $19,274, 9.2 percent.
   1982-83: $20,695, 7.4 percent.
   1983-84: $21,921, 5.9 percent.
   1984-85: $23,593, 7.6 percent.
   1985-86: $25,198, 6.8 percent.
   1986-87: $26,554, 5.3 percent.
   1987-88: $28,031, 5.6 percent.

<HEAD>Pope Expected To Denounce Drugs, Poverty In Ninth Trip To
Continent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II starts his ninth trip to
South America on Saturday, a visit expected to focus on the
pontiff's campaign against drugs and poverty in the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic continent.
   John Paul's 12-day itinerary will take him to Uruguay and Peru,
both for the second time, to impoverished Bolivia, high in the
Andes, and to a meeting in Paraguay with strongman Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner.
   The tour, John Paul's 37th foreign pilgrimage since he became
pope nine years ago, is a sign of the importance the Vatican gives
to an area expected to include half of the world's Roman Catholics
by the end of the century. The trip also leaves Cuba as the only
major country in the region not visited by the Polish-born pope.
   It will be a new test of the fitness of John Paul, who will turn
68 while in Paraguay on May 18. In addition to keeping to his usual
grueling schedule and delivering 60 speeches, he will make two
stops in the 2{-mile-high altitudes of Bolivia.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope's doctors
advised him to consider slowing down his pace at that altitude but
that John Paul replied: ``How can I do that?''
   The pope's first stop is Uruguay, considered the most secular
country in the region.
   John Paul then makes a five-day tour of Bolivia that will
include a stop in Santa Cruz, an eastern city where cocaine
traffickers are said to operate with near impunity.
   A U.S. congressional committee recently accused Bolivia, Peru
and Paraguay of failing to give the United States full cooperation
in the war on drugs. The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to
impose aid sanctions. The legislation was considered unlikely to
pass before a May 13 deadline.
   The pope, who on his 1985 trip to Peru noted that Andean natives
have traditionally used coca leaves to ward off fatigue and hunger,
is expected to denounce the international problem of cocaine
smuggling.
   In a special edition on the upcoming trip, the Vatican newspaper
called Bolivia ``one of the most tormented countries'' in South
America because of its economic and social problems and said that
drug trafficking was ``eroding and polluting'' all levels of
society.
   After Bolivia, the pope travels to the Peruvian capital of Lima
to deliver the closing address to a regional religious conference.
   Church officials said that from his jet window as he nears
Lima's airport, the pontiff will be greeted with ``Papa Paz,'' _ or
``Pope Peace'' _ a giant sign made of white flowers set in a
25-acre potato patch.
   The greeting is a play on words, since ``papa'' is the Spanish
word for both pope and the potato. Officials said the pope, who
speaks Spanish fluently, will readily understand the message.
   Church officials expect about 2 million people to attend Mass in
a seaside field with a 115-foot illuminated cross.
   In Paraguay the pope is scheduled to meet with Stroessner on May
16, when he arrives in the capital of Asuncion.
   Stroessner, who came to power in an army coup in 1954, was
recently re-elected to an eighth presidential term with an
officially announced 88.6 percent of the vote. Opposition
politicians claimed the election was rigged.
   During his visit to Chile in 1987, John Paul came under
criticism for meeting with the country's authoritarian ruler, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   The Vatican bristles at any suggestion that such meetings imply
the pope's support for a particular person or policy.
   ``He (the pope) doesn't consecrate any person or system,'' said
Navarro. ``He goes to visit the people.''
   The pope is scheduled to return to Rome on May 19.

<TEXT>
   Farm workers living illegally in the United
States could get a boost in their efforts to prove they're eligible
for amnesty under a judge's ruling Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton ordered the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to develop regulations for subpoenaing
records from employers of seasonal farmworkers applying for legal
residency.
   A lawsuit filed by the United Farm Workers charged that many
laborers are being unfairly denied a chance for citizenship because
of problems with proving they live and work in this country.
   The INS requires undocumented farm workers to submit documents
such as pay stubs to back up their claims that they picked
perishable crops for at least 90 days in recent years.
   But aliens who previously tried to avoid a paper trail for fear
of deportation are finding farmers aren't always willing to back
them up in writing, said attorneys for the union.
   ``The employers are saying, `Well, you're not working for me
now. I don't owe you anything. I didn't like the way you worked for
me anyway. I don't want to bother. Or I'm going to charge you
$25,''' said Stephen Rosenbaum, an attorney with California Rural
Legal Assistance.
   The UFW is seeking to loosen immigration regulations, allowing
farm workers simply to submit a written statement and putting the
burden on the INS to prove them wrong.
   Karlton held off on ruling on that request, but issued a
preliminary injunction ordering the INS regulations for issuing
subpoenas against reluctant employers.
   On Tuesday, the judge voided a rule that made aliens ineligible
for legalization if they left the United States since November 1986.
   On Thursday he suggested he may narrow the impact of that
ruling. ``I just sort of dropped my teeth and issued an order where
I'm going to have to issue another order and say who I'm talking
about,'' Karlton said.
   He scheduled a June 2 hearing on a motion to compel the INS to
extend the amnesty deadline for those affected.
   Wednesday was the deadline for illegal aliens who have lived in
the United States since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for amnesty.
Seasonal farm workers who picked perishable crops for at least 90
days in the year ending May 1, 1986, have until Nov. 30.
   Government attorneys said the the impact of the subpoena ruling
was small because INS already uses its subpoena power.
   ``We don't think there's much difference. It's not any different
from what's happening now,'' said Greg Hollows, deputy chief of
civil divisions in the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento.
   But Rosenbaum said the decision is significant because INS
officials infrequently issue subpoenas to help workers get
documents from growers.
   ``They may still make people jump through hoops in order to get
them,'' he said. ``But I certainly think it is more than an
academic victory.''

   Government lawyers are reviewing allegations
of impropriety by Attorney General Edwin Meese III and possible
perjury by other officials in the case of a company that says it
was pushed into bankruptcy by the Justice Department.
   One of the issues is whether Meese interceded with INSLAW Inc.'s
law firm and whether that had anything to do with the subsequent
dismissal of the lawyer representing the company.
   The Justice Department's public integrity section also is
reviewing conflicts in the sworn testimony of two former federal
bankruptcy trustees and two Justice Department officials during
bankruptcy court proceedings involving INSLAW, according to sources
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The testimony dealt with INSLAW's allegations that Justice
Department officials sought to put the company out of business by
trying, unsuccessfully, to convert its bankruptcy reorganization to
an outright liquidation.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay, who is conducting a criminal
investigation of Meese in several areas, is not probing the INSLAW
case but did refer information about it to the public integrity
section.
   ``We are not conducting an investigation with respect to the
INSLAW matter,'' said Carol Bruce, McKay's deputy. ``Any
information we have received relating to it we have referred to the
Justice Department's public integrity section.''
   But the section, after reviewing the material, could return it
to McKay's office for a fuller investigation of the Meese
allegation, according to a source familiar with the case.
   INSLAW attorneys told McKay that the company's original lawyer,
Leigh Ratiner, was fired from his Washington law firm after Meese
discussed the case with Leonard Garment, a politically connected
partner in the same firm.
   The Justice Department acknowledged to INSLAW in pre-trial
discovery that Meese recalled talking to Garment about the case in
the fall of 1986.
   Ratiner was soon asked to leave the law firm of Dickstein,
Shapiro & Morin. INSLAW says in court papers that Ratiner was told
Garment was instrumental in the decision to ask him to leave.
   Garment called the allegation ``pure baloney'' but acknowledged
that he was questioned about it two months ago by public-integrity
investigators. The current status of the Meese investigation could
not immediately be determined.
   The perjury investigation involves sworn depositions or
courtroom testimony given by witnesses in connection with INSLAW's
allegation that the Justice Department tried to force INSLAW into a
liquidation proceeding in bankruptcy court.
   INSLAW alleged that Justice Department officials deliberately
withheld $1.77 million in payments on a $10 million contract the
company had signed in 1982 to computerize 94 U.S. attorneys'
offices.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George F. Bason Jr. found in INSLAW's
favor and ordered the Justice Department to pay the company $6.8
million after ruling that government officials engaged in
``trickery, fraud and deceit'' to steal the company's software. The
department is appealing.
   Conversion of the case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a
Chapter 7 liquidation would have put INSLAW out of business. Under
Chapter 11 protection from creditors, INSLAW has been able to
reorganize and build up clients while arranging to pay off its
debts.
   Cornelius Blackshear, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York
City, gave a sworn deposition last year that when he was a U.S.
trustee in 1985 he was asked to help liquidate INSLAW by Thomas J.
Stanton, head of the Justice Department's Executive Office of U.S.
Trustees.
   But a day after he was deposed, Blackshear signed an affidavit
recanting the testimony, saying he had confused INSLAW with another
bankruptcy matter.
   Blackshear then gave a second deposition that was consistent
with the affidavit.
   In his ruling last year, Bason expressed disbelief about
Blackshear's recantation, although he called it ``an honest
mistake.''
   ``I believe that Judge Blackshear's original testimony is
accurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate,'' Bason said.
   The judge noted that Blackshear changed his initial testimony
after receiving telephone calls from William C. White, then U.S.
bankruptcy trustee in Alexandria, Va.
   White denied allegations that the Justice Department pressured
him to file a motion to liquidate INSLAW, to which Bason said that
``people do have a capacity to forget things when it is painful for
them to remember _ or maybe even inconvenient for them to
remember.''
   Bason said White's testimony was ``contrary to other credible
evidence.''
   Bason also rejected Stanton's sworn denials, saying: ``I found
Mr. Stanton's testimony in crucial respects to be evasive and
unbelievable.'' At another point, he said Stanton's testimony was
``utterly incredible and unworthy of belief.''
   Neither Blackshear, Stanton nor White returned a reporter's
telephone messages.
   The public integrity section is reviewing the testimony of
Blackshear, Stanton, White and Anthony F. Pasciuto, who recently
resigned as deputy director of the trustees office, the sources
said.
   Pasciuto has provided fresh allegations that Blackshear's
recantation was false.
   In a letter by his lawyer to the Justice Department, Pasciuto
alleged that Blackshear admitted to him last summer that the
recantation was false.
   ``I felt the easiest thing I could do was recant,'' Pasciuto
quotes Blackshear as saying. ``I felt less people would be hurt if
I just bailed out.''
   Pasciuto's lawyer, Gary Simpson, wrote the letter to then-Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns to protest Justice Department efforts
to fire his client for violating regulations by meeting with INSLAW
president William Hamilton and Hamilton's wife, Nancy.
   Pasciuto was allowed to resign and has joined a private
financial firm in New York.
   During the meeting, Pasciuto told the Hamiltons about pressure
from Stanton to liquidate their company. But in court testimony,
Pascuito said his statements to the Hamiltons were fabricated _
made up to injure Stanton for delaying a long-awaited promotion.
   Told of the investigation, Pasciuto's lawyer said: ``Tony
Pasciuto has the documentation that many of the things he was
saying were true.''
   Bason concluded that Stanton sought to liquidate INSLAW to
``curry favor'' with Justice Department officials following a
conversation with C. Madison Brewer, who administered the INSLAW
contract.
   Brewer previously worked for INSLAW but was fired, and the judge
concluded that Brewer was ``consumed by hatred and an intense
desire for revenge.''
   The department's Office of Professional Responsibility is
investigating Brewer's conduct.

   A House-approved amendment to the defense
spending bill calls for using American military might to halt the
flow of illegal drugs, but the measure faces Pentagon opposition
and review by a conference committee.
   By a 385-23 vote Thursday, the House adopted a measure ordering
the president to ``deploy equipment and personnel of the Armed
Forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of United States
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics.''
   The House passed similar anti-drug amendments in 1985 and 1986,
but they were later eliminated by conference committees. Among the
obstacles this time around is opposition from Defense Secretary
Frank C. Carlucci.
   ``That is not a function of the military,'' Carlucci said in an
interview earlier this year. ``We are not the front-line agency in
the war on drugs.''
   Carlucci was interviewed after Education Secretary William
Bennett had raised the possbility in a speech.
   House members admitted Thursday that the amendment has
shortcomings. ``Yes, it is flawed,'' said Rep. Jack Davis, R-Ill.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, agreed. ``This thing has serious problems,'' he said.
   Aspin had proposed adding $350 million to the bill for the Coast
Guard, which has cut anti-drug patrols by 55 percent because of
budget problems.
   The money would be used to pay for more Coast Guard patrols,
along with buying six more patrol helicopters, six patrol boats,
and a pair of radar aircraft to track smugglers.
   Davis and other Republicans raised the total to $475 million and
added the amendment ordering the military to seal American borders.
   The House also voted Thursday to spend $600 million for research
into the single-warhead Midgetman weapon that the Reagan
administration wants to kill.
   ``The message here is that there is a lot of support for
Midgetman,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., speaking shortly before
the 231-171 vote.
   AuCoin's plan proposes only $100 million for the railroad-based
version of the 10-warhead MX. President Reagan wants 50 of those
missiles to go with 50 more MX weapons that will be put into
land-based silos.
   Reagan had sought only $200 million for the Midgetman and $793
million for the rail-based MX.
   The Senate will begin work next week on its version of the
Pentagon budget, and that measure proposes only $50 million for
Midgetman and $700 million for MX. Differences between the two
bills will be worked out by a House-Senate conference committee.
   In addition to being opposed by the Reagan administration, the
Midgetman is also opposed by both active candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination _ Michael Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson.
   But ``candidates can change their mind,'' Aspin said. He noted
that Reagan originally opposed basing the MX on railroads, but now
supports that plan.
   The dispute involves a successor to the aging Minuteman as the
heart of America's land-based nuclear deterrent, a triad which also
includes submarine-launched missiles and bombers.
   Supporters of the MX say it has already been developed and would
be much cheaper to simply build 50 more and put them on railroads.
But Midgetman backers contend the MX is vulnerable to a Soviet
first strike and nuclear stability would be improved by building a
weapon that has fewer warheads and thus is less attractive as a
target.
   In another defense issue, Carlucci said congressional demands
that America's allies pay more for defense are misguided and amount
to a ``high-stakes game of `chicken''' that the United States can't
afford to play.
   Carlucci, addressing the Foreign Policy Association in New York
City, said recent attacks in Congress on NATO and other allies like
Japan and South Korea suggest ``a growing inclination towards
isolationism _ a kind of withdrawal syndrome from our international
obligations and interests.''

<HEAD>House Panel Seeks Wider Federal Probe of Eastern Airlines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that would further embarrass
Eastern Airlines by prodding the Transportation Department to
expand its investigation of the troubled carrier is on its way to
the House.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a
resolution on Thursday urging the department to widen its probe of
Eastern and its parent company, Texas Air Corp.
   The non-binding measure was approved by a voice vote, garnering
support from committee members of both parties. It is not certain
when the measure will be considered by the full House, where 210
lawmakers _ almost half the membership _ are already co-sponsors.
   Management at Texas Air and Eastern is locked in a lengthy
battle with the airline's unions that has spilled into Congress,
the courts and the news media.
   Company executives have sought a number of steps _ including
wage concessions _ to stem a huge tide of red ink, and have said
the congressional resolution is merely a ploy by the unions. But
labor leaders say management's real goal is to destroy the unions,
and that a study of the company's leadership and its operations is
justified.
   ``I don't think we're being led by our nose because of a
labor-management problem,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., the
resolution's original sponsor. ``We're being driven by safety
considerations.''
   Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, ranking Republican on
the committee, also supported the measure as a ``statement of
support'' for the Transportation Department probe.
   The Transportation Department announced last month that it had
begun investigating the management, financial status and safety
practices of Texas Air, Eastern and another Texas Air subsidiary,
Continental Airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration is also
inspecting Eastern and Continental planes.
   The non-binding resolution approved Thursday urges the
department to widen its investigation by looking more closely at
how Texas Air and Eastern practices affect the public and company
employees. It also seeks to have the department use its findings in
deciding whether to allow Texas Air to make future operating
changes, such as selling the Eastern air shuttle.
   After the vote, Capt. John Knudson, a spokesman for Eastern's
unionized pilots, said the resolution would ``send a mandate to the
Department of Transportation and the FAA to ensure a full and
public airing of the issues.''
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak, speaking from company
headquarters in Miami, said the measure was ``part of the unions'
campaign to lobby Congress, discredit Eastern and frighten away
customers.''
   A similar resolution in the Senate has 14 co-sponsors.
   Meanwhile, at the U.S. Court of Appeals, Eastern asked a panel
of judges to overturn a lower court's ruling that blocks the
airline from selling its profitable Boston-New York-Washington air
shuttle service. The court reserved judgment.

<HEAD>Department Drops Use Of Quarantine In Bee Mite Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department quarantine ordered a
month ago in 13 states to stop the spread of destructive bee mites
was canceled today because it proved to be unworkable and too
costly.
   The states are: Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Thursday the restrictions are
being lifted, effective today, on the movement of bees and
equipment from those states.
   Although not known to be harmful to other creatures, the mites
are considered a major threat to the nation's honey and beekeeping
industry.
   The tiny killer mites, Varroa Jacobsoni, were first discovered
in the United States last September in a Wisconsin apiary. They
since have spread to the other states.
   ``Information received from state governments, beekeepers,
growers and researchers has caused us to conclude that the
regulatory program established under the quarantine is not the
appropriate mechanism to contain the interstate spread of Varroa
mites,'' Glosser said.
   The original purpose of the quarantines was to issue permits for
out-of-state movement of only bees and equipment found to be free
of the mites.
   ``However, we've found that the requirements under the
quarantine are not uniformly appropriate or workable because the
role of honeybees in the agricultural economy varies widely from
state to state,'' Glosser said. ``Many beekeepers have found it
impossible to comply with the regulations and still meet their own
deadlines.''
   For example, he said, a beehive might have to be moved out of
its home state several times a year. Treating a hive against mites
requires 21 days, which is longer than most beehives are scheduled
to stay in a state when they are moved for pollination purposes.
   Beekeeping is credited by USDA with the pollination of many
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around $20
billion. Those include many fruits, vegetables and hay crops.
   Glosser said other factors weighed on the decision to cancel the
quarantines, including a shortage of treatment materials, and
limited state and federal resources to conduct and coordinate
surveys and inspections.
   ``The movement of hundreds of thousands of hives and other
regulated articles tends to occur during short periods in the
spring and fall, intensifying the demand for inspection services
beyond the limits of current federal and state resources,'' he said.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. It causes decreased brood, deformed
bees and a weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants
and produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done.
   Glosser said his agency will continue to coordinate the
collection of survey information about the mite.
   ``We feel, however, that state governments, producers and
beekeepers can best tailor Varroa mite detection, control and other
measures to the needs of their particular state,'' he said.

   The Agriculture Department says record large
supplies of red meat and poultry for the sixth straight year are
expected to chew into the financial returns of livestock producers
in 1988.
   Although that is not good news for producers, the huge supplies
will help hold down meat and poultry prices at the retail level.
   ``Reduced beef supplies are being more than offset by increased
volumes of pork and poultry,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said Thursday. ``Feed costs are rising due to expanding
exports, increased domestic use and reduced production.''
   Poultry output is being led by an expected 5 percent increase in
broiler production, with most of the increase coming in the first
half of the year.
   Commercial pork production rose 7 percent from a year earlier in
the first quarter of 1988, reflecting a gradual increase by hog
producers. Production is expected to be up 10 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, 8 percent in the third, and about even
in the fourth.
   ``Returns to (hog) producers may fall to near breakeven before
the third quarter ends,'' the agency reported. ``And negative
returns are possible in the fall.''
   Beef production will likely rise above year-earlier levels in
the second quarter because of more feedlot cattle going to
slaughter at heavier weights.
   ``Returns above cash costs for cow-calf producers are expected
to remain positive in 1988, but returns to Great Plains cattle
feeders may turn negative during the late spring and summer,'' the
report said.

   Coastal Russet has beautiful eyes and a lovely
skin, says the Agriculture Department.
   Coastal Russet, is a new, pure white baking potato that will be
on its way this fall to grocery shelves. It's a 6- to 8-inch-long
potato recently released to growers by plant breeders in New York,
Florida, Virginia, New Jersey and Maine.
   Although developed specially for the diverse growing conditions
of the eastern coastal areas from Maine to Florida, researchers
found Coastal Russet can be grown throughout the United States,
officials said Thursday.
   ``Consumers will find this baked potato to be whiter and moister
than Russet Burbank, the nation's leading baking potato,'' said
Robert W. Goth, a plant pathologist in the department's
Agricultural Research Service. ``Many potatoes turn light beige
inside when baked, but not Coastal Russet.''
   The potato was developed over 10 years of research led by
retired plant pathologist Raymon E. Webb at the agency's vegetable
laboratory in Beltsville, Md.
   ``Its shallow eyes and attractive skin pattern look good in a
package, making it pleasing to the producer and the consumer,''
Goth said.

<HEAD>DOT Proposes Random Railroad Drug Testing, New Alcohol Rules For
Truckers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal for random drug testing of railroad
workers should be sidetracked by the courts, which have already
stopped a program of testing train crews after accidents, the
attorney for railway unions says.
   ``This really smacks of `chutzpah,' '' said Lawrence Mann,
attorney for the Railway Labor Executives' Association, an umbrella
group for 20 unions. Mann said Thursday the group opposes any plan
that puts a burden on workers without ``reasonable suspicion'' of a
violation.
   ``Rail labor will be given its due process by the Federal
Railroad Administration, and then they'll tell us where to go,'' he
said. He predicted the issue would end up in the courts.
   The proposal to compel railroads to begin random drug tests of
workers in positions affecting public safety was announced at a
news conference Thursday by Secretary of Transportation Jim Burnley.
   At the same time, Burnley said the department was moving to
crack down on drunken driving by commercial bus and truck drivers,
with the threat of license losses for first-time offenders.
   Burnley said he grew tried of waiting for Congress to enact
random drug testing, which he said would play ``a major role'' in
ridding the nation's railroads of illegal drugs.
   A rail safety bill that includes a random drug testing provision
has stalled in a House-Senate conference committee.
   Burnley also used the news conference to announce the proposed
crackdown on drunk driving by bus and truck drivers.
   Under the new standard, which states would be expected to adopt
in coming years, first-time violators would be subject to a
one-year loss of their commercial driver's licenses if found to
have an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or more. A second
citation would mean a lifetime suspension.
   The strict 0.04 standard ``is significantly below'' the 0.10
figure now set by most states as the level for ``under the
influence'' crimimal penalties, Burnley said.
   While it still would be up to the states to take action against
the drivers, the states could lose some highway aid money beginning
in 1993 if they do not adopt the stricter standard.
   Burnley said the tougher standard was warranted because of the
larger vehicles that commercial operators drive, and the amount of
time they spend behind the wheel.
   The steps announced Thursday follow by two months a DOT plan of
drug testing for all employees in sensitive safety and
security-related positions in the aviation industry.
   Random drug testing of railroad workers would complement the
existing system of testing train crews involved in major accidents.
That program has continued while the Reagan administration appeals
a federal court ruling on Feb. 11 that declared such testing
unconstitutional.
   Burnley said he was confident the Supreme Court would uphold
post-accident testing.
   But even if the high court does side with DOT, Federal Railroad
Administrator John Riley said random drug testing was a necessary
complement to existing rules.
   ``The success of a reasonable-cause drug-testing program is
dependent on the supervisor's ability to detect symptoms,'' Riley
said. ``Unfortunately, many drugs in use today can impair an
engineer's judgment without producing symptoms recognizable to even
a trained layman. Random testing isn't keyed to observable
symptoms, and the users know that.''
   Under the proposal, railroads would have to establish random
urine testing programs for marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and PCP.

<HEAD>Brigham Young University Recovers Missing Monet Sketch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVO, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Monet pencil sketch stolen from Brigham
Young University's art collection nearly two decades ago has been
returned, a university spokesman said.
   ``Two Women In A Boat,'' valued at $100,000 to $250,000, was
among more than 1,000 art works worth some $3 million found to be
missing when the school's 12,000-piece collection was inventoried
in 1986.
   University police recovered the sketch, also known as ``The Boat
Ride,'' from an unidentified collector in New York, school
spokesman Brent Harker said Thursday.
   The collector voluntarily relinquished the piece, which had been
purchased from an auction house.
   The Monet and two sketches by Winslow Homer, ``The Shepherdess''
and ``Over The Garden Wall,'' were taken from the university for
authentication in 1969 by Dion O'Wyatt, a New York art dealer,
Harker said.
   O'Wyatt, however, sold the three pieces but had forgeries made
of ``Two Women In A Boat'' and ``The Shepherdess'' and gave them to
Brigham Young, Harker said.
   University officials discovered the forgeries and realized that
``Over The Garden Wall'' was missing during the inventory, Harker
said.
   O'Wyatt pleaded no contest in November to theft by deception in
connection with the three missing sketches and was given a
suspended jail term and fine provided he help return the original
works, Harker said.
   The original ``The Shepherdess'' was recovered in December, but
the owner of ``Over The Garden Wall'' refused to relinquish the
sketch and the university has hired an attorney to try to recover
it, Harker said.
   Harker described the three sketches as the ``crown jewels'' of
the missing art works.
   Wes Burnside, a BYU art professor and curator of the collection
from 1973 until his retirement in 1983, was accused by BYU
officials of involvement in the disappearance of the art works,
most of which are believed to have been stolen, improperly traded
or sold between 1972 and 1978.
   Burnside pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in exchange for
immunity from prosecution, and in March was named a defendant in a
civil suit aimed at recovering the missing pieces.
   Harker said the sketch brings to about 60 the number of art
works recovered, and that university officials know the whereabouts
of about 140 more and are seeking their return.

<HEAD>Wallach Told Meese the SBA Chief Was the Key to Wedtech Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks before the head of the Small
Business Administration was fired in 1982, Edwin Meese III was told
by Wedtech Corp. consultant E. Robert Wallach that the SBA chief
was the central figure in deciding whether Wedtech got a lucrative
no-bid contract.
   ``Apparently, the key figure at this particular moment is Frank
Cardenas, the director of the SBA,'' Wallach wrote then-White House
counselor Meese in a Jan. 21, 1982 memo released Thursday by a
Senate subcommittee. ``If my information is correct this may be the
last step and Cardenas is the key figure.''
   The SBA administrator at that time was Michael Cardenas.
   A few days earlier, Cardenas and his deputy, David Gonzales, had
decided not to sign off on the Wedtech contract until Army
officials were satisfied with terms and conditions, according to a
report by the Senate subcommittee.
   Cardenas and Gonzales have said that at a Jan. 15, 1982 meeting,
they resisted suggestions by White House aides Pier Talenti and
Henry Zuniga that Wedtech receive the $32 million contract to build
small engines for the Army.
   Cardenas was dismissed by the White House on Feb. 5, 1982 on
grounds of incompetence, and Gonzales was forced out with him.
   The Senate subcommittee reached no conclusions as to whether
Cardenas was fired because of the Wedtech contract or whether
Wallach's memo to Meese alerted the White House counselor to the
situation.
   Cardenas' replacement, James Sanders, later arranged for Wedtech
to get the work. Army officials felt the company's price was too
high, but their concerns were quieted when SBA agreed to make
several million dollars available in advance payments and business
and development expenses.
   Wallach, now under indictment for alleged racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal, has been a friend of Meese's for 30 years.
   Copies of 16 memos by Wallach to Meese, including the one dated
Jan. 21, 1982, were released by the Senate subcommittee on
oversight of government management. On Wednesday, the panel
released a report concluding that Meese and his deputy, James
Jenkins, had violated a White House policy barring participation in
individual contracts, resulting in improper favoritism toward
Wedtech.
   According to Wallach's Jan. 21 memo, Cardenas had the power to
return the contract to the Army for competitive bidding, or to keep
it under an SBA set-aside program for minority-run firms.

<HEAD>LaRouche Says `No Case' Against Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche says a
federal jury in Boston would have acquitted him and his associates
of conspiracy charges if the judge had not declared a mistrial.
   ``There was no case,'' LaRouche said at a news conference
Thursday in Washington. ``The case was a political fraud and a hoax
from the beginning.''
   He cited a story in Thursday's editions of the Boston Herald
that quoted one juror as saying, ``There was too much question of
government misconduct in what was happening'' in the LaRouche
campaign.
   The newspaper reported that the 14 jurors held a ``surprise
vote'' in the jury room after they were excused from the case on
Wednesday and that they voted unanimously to acquit LaRouche and
his aides.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham, who handled the
government's case, could not be reached for comment.
   Prosecutors in the case said Wednesday that they would press for
a new trial of LaRouche, six aides and five affiliated
organizations on charges they raised money for LaRouche's 1984
presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud.
   LaRouche, a candidate for the 1988 Democratic nomination for
president, and his aides also are charged with conspiring to stymie
a grand jury investigation of the alleged fraud.
   LaRouche defies traditional political labels, espousing views of
global conspiracies and future calamities.
   At his news conference, he predicted that the U.S. economy would
plunge into depression within the next year and that if another
Democrat were elected president, he would turn to LaRouche for
guidance and a possible Cabinet post.
   LaRouche denied that defense attorneys had tried to slow down
the Boston trial, which began on Dec. 17, 1987, and contended that
the U.S. attorney's office in recent weeks had ``tried to delay the
trial to get a mistrial in order to prevent an acquittal.''
   LaRouche contended that defense attorneys had pushed to have a
pretrial hearing into defense allegations of government misconduct
and infiltration of LaRouche groups. But, LaRouche said, government
attorneys balked. Instead, Keeton halted the trial two months ago
for the hearing.
   During the proceedings, the government declassified a memo in
which retired Air Force Maj. Richard Secord told then-National
Security Council aide Oliver North about an associate's effort to
``get info against LaRouche.''
   A search of FBI files based on that disclosure led to the
discovery of another classified document in which three
intelligence operatives said top-level CIA and FBI officials had
asked them to infiltrate LaRouche groups.

<HEAD>Ancient Humanlike Animal Was Toolmaker, Scientist Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A humanlike creature that became extinct more
than a million years ago was not ``all thumbs'' after all, a
scientist claims in a study published today.
   In fact, says Randall L. Susman of the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, the small-brained hominid called Paranthropus
robustus had fingers and thumbs that were easily capable of turning
bones and rocks into tools during the era almost 2 million years
ago that the ancestors of modern humans were evolving the same
skills.
   Susman, an expert in primate anatomy, said most experts on early
humanlike animals believe that only the genus Homo, the ancestors
of modern humans, could make tools. But after examining fossils
unearthed in South Africa, Susman said he believes that
Paranthropus robustus also was a toolmaker and, in fact, could have
taught our ancestors this skill.
   Paranthropus robustus apparently emerged in Africa about 2.5
million years ago. The species did not evolve further, as did the
ancestors of mankind, and became extinct about 1.4 million years
ago. Susman said many experts have long believed that one reason
this large-toothed creature became extinct was that it could not
use tools.
   The experts, says Susman, were not giving proper credit to the
skills and dexterity of Paranthropus robustus. The proof, he said,
is in the thumb.
   Fossils dug up at Swartkrans in South Africa and dated from
about 1.8 million years ago show that Paranthropus robustus had a
very human-like thumb, said Susman.
   The Paranthropus thumb, like the human hand, was capable of
``precision grasping,'' and not just the ``power grasping'' of the
lower primates, he said.
   ``Precision grasping and power grasping require two different
types of anatomy,'' said Susman. Power grasping is the type used
when lifting a heavy suitcase or when doing a chin up. The fingers
become a hook-like grip and the thumb is just tucked out of the way.
   ``Precision grasp is the way you would pick up a raisin or the
way you would thread a needle,'' said Susman. ``Precision grasp
requires pulp to pulp contact between thumb and index finger. Power
grasp doesn't. When we look at hand anatomy ... we can see that
humans have unmistakable hallmarks of precision grasp.''
   So did Paranthropus, according to Susman.
   The fossils show that the Paranthropus thumb was connected to a
``saddle joint'' that was able to direct the thumb around to touch
the pads on each of the finger tips. It is a skill that only humans
have.
   ``A chimpanzee cannot rotate its thumb around,'' said Susman.
``When it picks up a grape, it does it in the same way that we
would turn a key in a lock _ a pinch of the thumb against the side
of the index finger.''
   Because of this finding, Susman believes the popular belief
about Paranthropus robustus _ that it died out because it could not
make tools _ is wrong.
   ``The explanation why Paranthropus became extinct is probably
more subtle and complicated than we think,'' said Susman. ``It is
possible that some environmental change took place and the
Paranthropus was not able to adapt'' as well as the larger-brained
Homo genus.
   Susman said tools have been found with the fossils of
Paranthropus robustus in African digs where there are no remains
from the Homo genus. At the Swartkrans dig, however, about 10
percent of the fossils have been identified as from the Homo genus.
Susman believes that the tools found there have the best chance of
being made and used by Paranthropus robustus, which makes up about
90 percent of the humanlike fossils found on the site.
   These fossils were unearthed about five years ago and Susman is
the first anatomy expert to examine them.
   Eric Delson, a professor of anthropology at the College of the
City of New York, also has examined the fossils and believes Susman
is correct that they represent the hands of a toolmaker.
   But Delson said it has not been proven positively that the
fossils are, in fact, those of Paranthropus robustus.
   ``The tools could be from the Homo species,'' said Delson.
   Delson also argues that Susman may be premature about his
conclusions on the effect of tool making on the two humanlike
species.
   ``All of this is inferential and I think he is making too much
of his inferences,'' said Delson.
   Susman's study was published today in Science, the journal of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>New Play Is Oblique Slice of Life</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A screenwriter revisits people and places from
his past in ``No Time Flat,'' a slice-of-life drama in which the
sharpness of the slice is softened by a dream-like quality.
   The play, the seventh by Larry Ketron to be produced by the WPA
Theater, is very well acted, especially by Daniel Ahearn in the
lead role of Calter, the screenwriter whose manner is more Southern
country than Hollywood.
   The story begins with Calter's return to the Carolinas, where
his oldest friend, a policeman, is hospitalized after being shot in
the chest. Calter talks in the hospital waiting room with his
friend's wife, played by Linda Cook, who has appeared on the
television soap operas ``All My Children'' and ``Edge of Night.''
   Calter goes to visit an old girlfriend, and meets her daughter
Carolina (Sandra Bullock), a laid-back teenager who announces
she'll drive to New York with him. There, Calter tries to visit
another old girlfriend, finds she has moved from where she was 25
years ago, but does visit an old Vietnam buddy, played by Paul
Geier.
   The buddies' meandering conversation is the weakest part of the
play. There is the inevitable blaming of the writer for being a
spectator instead of a participant in life.
   But Calter seems content, digging up people and incidents from
his past that he'll probably use in his writing and seeming to find
that, in his case, he can go home again.
   Peter Maloney directed the off-Broadway production which was
seen on its opening night Wednesday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Could Pick Up Two-Thirds Of Nevada Delegates This Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevada Democrats open a three-day state
convention today amid intense jockeying for slots on the 23-member
delegation to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta this
summer.
   Party veterans say by the time the event winds down on Sunday,
Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis could hold
official and unofficial commitments from two-thirds of the Nevada
delegation.
   Dukakis had 32 percent of the 980 delegates elected at earlier
county conventions to attend the state convention, while Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., who hs since halted his campaign, had 27 percent.
Jesse Jackson had 25 percent, and the remaining 16 percent was
uncommitted.
   But the delegates are free to change their preferences as they
sign in on Friday and Saturday, and Dukakis could be the big
beneficiary now that Gore, popular in Nevada, is out of the picture.
   However, there is an effort to hold together the Gore delegates
so that they'll have representatives on the national delegation. To
do that, they must maintain 15 percent of the total state
convention delegation.
   But if many of the Gore delegates switch, party officials
predict Dukakis will benefit more than Jackson and could wind up
with eight or nine of the 16 elected delegates.
   Nevada also has seven ``super delegates'' who have a voice at
the convention due to being elected or party officeholders.
   Among those, it was possible that Dukakis would expand his
current count of three to as many as six. However, some of those
delegates will remain officially uncommitted despite their support
for Dukakis.

   Strike leaders who escaped a pre-dawn
police raid to crush a 10-day stoppage at the huge Nowa Huta
steelworks expressed outrage that the assault came just hours after
management agreed to reopen talks.
   They claimed the strike was not ended by Thursday's raid, as
authorities claimed, and said police hurt at least 32 people in the
action.
   A priest who was present said many strikers were brutally beaten.
   In a statement issued afterwards, strike committee members who
had gone into hiding called on plant workers to stay home: ``The
brutal actions by the ZOMOs (riot troops) and the SB (secret
police) did not break our strike.''
   Before the riot squads moved in, plainclothesmen had rousted the
strikers from sleep with deafening percussion grenades.
   Strikers said a protest march against the raid occurred on plant
grounds Thursday morning and that as soon as police left many
laborers refused to work.
   The statement from strike leaders said that although their
demands for higher wages, free trade unions and the reinstatement
of fired union activists had not changed, their main concern now
was for strikers arrested in the raid.
   ``We have a moral duty to fight for their immediate release,''
it said.
   Strike committee sources said committee chairman Andrzej
Szewczuwaniec had worked out an evacuation plan in the event of a
raid.
   They said he and five other members of the 16-member committee
escaped. The government said 38 people in all were seized during
the two-hour police action.
   ``The whole thing took place without one bruise,'' government
spokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press. ``Nobody suffered
any harm or injury.''
   But several people present said police beat strikers after
blocking exits from a building where the strike committee was based.
   The Rev. Tadeusz Zaleski was with the strikers during the raid.
Police later turned him over to Roman Catholic Church officials.
   Zaleski said ``riot police were beating with very long heavy
sticks.''
   Some strikers ``were chased and beaten. The riot police were
very brutal and on many occasions beat people who already had been
caught,'' the priest added.
   Zaleski said police ``totally demolished'' the strike center,
emptying closets, breaking windows and tossing around belongings.
He said his vestments were scattered and the altar where he said
Mass for workers was destroyed.
   Zygmunt Lenyk of the conservative opposition group Confederation
of Independent Poland said 32 people suffered cuts, eight people
were left unconscious and one man's legs were broken.
   Strike sources said they were especially angry because the
attack came after management, apparently scheming to catch strikers
off guard, had just agreed to meet with the strike committee for
the first time in a week.
   Anna Mach, whose husband Maciej is on the strike committee, said
he called her at 1 a.m. Thursday and expressed relief that
management agreed to meet with the committee and Catholic mediators
at 8 a.m.
   One strike source said that at 7 a.m., about 1,500 workers began
marching on the management building to protest the raid but were
dispersed by police.
   Workers leaving the plant during an afternoon shift change
Thursday told Western reporters that some people inside the mill
had resumed striking.
   The state-run news agency PAP said plant operations were being
restored but were hampered by up to 40 percent absenteeism, which
it blamed in part on threats by strikers against people who wanted
to work.
   The strike at the 32,000-worker steel mill began April 26 and
talks broke off when it was declared illegal two days later. Strike
leaders had claimed half the workforce was participating.

   The days of obliging cabbies chasing a missed
train to the next town to get a passenger aboard may be gone, but a
missed riverboat posed only a bit of a problem for a Little Rock
cabdriver Tuesday.
   The cabdriver, Fred Higgins, was hailed by Bruce Robinson of New
Haven, Conn., outside the Excelsior Hotel.
   Robinson had missed a tour bus that was to take a conference
group to Riverfront Park in North Little Rock, where the Spirit, an
excursion boat, embarks on a dinner cruise on the Arkansas River.
   When Higgins and Robinson reached the park, the boat had already
left. ``He was real disappointed, so I said, `Let's try one more
time,''' Higgins said.
   The cabbie headed upriver, hoping to intercept the boat.
Arriving at Murray Lock and Dam, they saw the Spirit heading toward
them in the distance. The question then became how to get Robinson
from the taxi to the boat.
   ``He really wanted to ride it bad,'' said Higgins, who has
worked for the cab company only a month. Spotting two men in a
small pleasure boat, he called them to shore and explained the
situation. The boaters took Robinson aboard.
   Moments later, Dan Burch, captain of the Spirit, spotted the
small boat circling his craft and learned it had a passenger who
wanted to board.
   ``We kind of thought they were kidding,'' Burch said. ``We
slowed the boat and the pleasure craft came to the stern and the
guy got on. He really got a kick out of it.''
   Beverly House of Hospitality Tours, the cruise organizer, said
Robinson made it just in time for dinner. ``We all applauded,'' she
said.
   Higgins got $10 from Robinson for his trouble.

   Beatrice C. Draper gave Norwalk's mayor a
penny and her thoughts after she was billed for one cent on a
delinquent city automobile tax.
   Draper said she tried to pay the debt in person after she
received the first bill for one cent, but a tax clerk wouldn't take
the payment and said the debt wouldn't affect anything anyway.
   Then Draper got hung up at a state Department of Motor Vehicles
office trying to register a car because computerized records showed
she had a tax debt. And the other day, she received a second bill
from the city for one cent.
   She taped the penny to a letter she mailed to Mayor Frank J.
Esposito.
   ``The point I am trying to make is that the abuse of community
and town funds is ridiculous,'' she wrote. ``The amount of money
spent on time and postage could have been used to better advantage.
... Even though it costs 25 cents, please send me a receipt of my
one-cent payment.''
   Esposito blamed the charge on a new computer that sends the tax
bills. ``This is the first problem we know of, and I am going to
see what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening
again,'' the mayor said.

   A movie museum paid $36,828 at an auction for the
fringed black dress Marilyn Monroe wore in ``Some Like It Hot'' as
the ukelele-playing singer in an all-woman band.
   The skin-tight dress, with its plunging V-neckline and tasseled
skirt, was bought Thursday at Christie's auction house by the
Museum of Moving Image, which opens in September.
   ``It's tacky, but it's lovely. It's such a sexy dress,'' said
David Robinson, the film critic for The Times of London who made
the final bid on behalf of the museum.
   Bidding began at $5,580 and quickly soared as a model wearing
the dress shimmied around to the music of ``Running Wild,'' which
Miss Monroe sang in the 1959 film.
   The dress was sold by the owner of a museum that closed in

<HEAD>Aloha President Defends Airline's Maintenance Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aloha Airlines' president and chief executive
officer Maurice Myers says Aloha will match its maintenance
inspection record against any carrier in the country.
   According to Federal Aviation Administration documents, an
in-depth inspection of Aloha by the FAA last December found the
airline did not have an adequate system to assure that its aircraft
were properly maintained.
   The inspection included examination of Aloha's compliance with a
special surveillance requirement for aging aircraft, but indicated
no specific concerns about the aging Boeing 737 jet which broke
apart during a flight last week.
   A 20-foot section of the plane's upper fuselage tore away at
24,000 feet, sending a flight attendant to her death and injuring
61 passengers, although the plane limped to a safe landing.
   According to the FAA, the 19-year-old plane, which had 89,000
landings, was one of four Aloha aircraft under a special inspection
program aimed at aging aircraft as well as a special FAA
airworthiness directive warning about possible cracking in the
upper portion of the fuselage.
   The inspectors concluded that the airline did not have ``an
effective internal audit program'' to make certain it was complying
with federal requirements, including emergency FAA airworthiness
directives.
   Myers said Thursday the company had undergone the required
investigation which he described as ``a very thorough inspection
which focuses on procedures and record keeping, not on equipment.''
   ``In our final briefing by the FAA, we were told by the
inspection team that the items found were typical of airlines
across the country and that we run a safe airline,'' Myers said in
a statement. ``We will match our maintenance inspection record
against any carrier in the country.''
   Aloha operates scheduled air service to four islands _ Kauai,
Oahu, Maui and Hawaii _ in the Hawaiian island group as well as
some charter services.

<HEAD>Asked About Meese, FBI Director Says He'd Resign if Ethics
Questioned</HEAD>

   FBI Director William Sessions responded to
questions about Attorney General Edwin Meese III by saying public
officials have an obligation to maintain the highest legal and
ethical standards.
   An independent counsel investigating Meese since last May 11 is
expected to issue a report raising sharp questions about the
attorney general's ethical behavior, according to sources familiar
with the probe.
   ``Ethical conduct in connection with lawyers particularly is a
very sensitive matter,'' Sessions said Thursday when asked by
reporters about the embattled attorney general.
   ``I think it's even more important when you're dealing with a
person who is, in fact, the attorney general of the United States,
and I think that Mr. Meese would strongly agree with that,'' added
the FBI director.
   Sessions emphasized that he was addressing the principle of
ethical conduct and not the specifics of the Meese case, the
subject of a nearly yearlong investigation by a special prosecutor.
   Sessions said he would resign his own post if the public felt he
had engaged in improprieties.
   ``If it is perceived that the director of the FBI ... is not
properly, legally and ethically carrying out his responsibility, I
always have open the route of resignation for myself,'' Sessions
said when asked, in the context of Meese's legal troubles, what he
would do if he sensed the public thought he were acting improperly.
   But Sessions added that ``I think there's a great deal of
difference between'' a hypothetical situation involving himself and
``the circumstances'' involving allegations against Meese.
   When a reporter asked whether Sessions would be unhappy if his
remarks were interpreted as suggesting that Meese, his boss,
perhaps ought to resign, the FBI director responded:
   ``No, I think you'll have to draw your own conclusions.'' But he
quickly added that ``I'm trying to talk about general principles
that I do believe apply to conduct of public officials. ... I can
speak as to myself, but I am not trying to speak as to those
circumstances that might involve Mr. Meese.''
   After checking with Meese about Sessions' remarks, Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland declined to comment.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay has been investigating
Meese's ties to the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline and other matters. Sources familiar with the probe
say McKay is expected to issue a report raising several ethical
questions about the attorney general's ties to longtime friend E.
Robert Wallach, who is under indictment in the Wedtech case.
   A Senate subcommittee on Thursday disclosed that two weeks
before the head of the Small Business Administration was fired in
1982, Meese was told by Wallach that the SBA chief was the central
figure in deciding whether Wedtech got a lucrative no-bid contract.
   ``Apparently, the key figure at this particular moment is Frank
Cardenas, the director of the SBA,'' Wallach wrote then-White House
counselor Meese in a Jan. 21, 1982 memo released by the Senate
subcommittee. ``If my information is correct this may be the last
step and Cardenas is the key figure.''
   The SBA administrator at that time was Michael Cardenas.
   A few days earlier, Cardenas and his deputy, David Gonzales, had
decided not to sign off on the Wedtech contract until the Army was
satisfied with the terms and conditions, according to a report by
the Senate subcommittee.
   But Cardenas was dismissed by the White House on Feb. 5, 1982 on
grounds of incompetence, and Gonzales was forced out with him.
   The Senate subcommittee reached no conclusions about whether
Cardenas was fired because of the Wedtech contract or whether
Wallach's memo to Meese alerted the White House counselor to the
situation.
   Copies of 16 memos by Wallach, then a Wedtech consultant, to
Meese, including the one dated Jan. 21, 1982, were released by the
Senate subcommittee on oversight of government management.
   On Wednesday, the panel released a report concluding that Meese
and his deputy, James Jenkins, had violated a White House policy
barring participation in individual contracts, resulting in
improper favoritism toward Wedtech.

   The United States must make a much more
ambitious effort to cut its budget deficit, for the benefit of
other countries as well as itself, the International Monetary Fund
says.
   ``Recent history suggests that such an approach need not create
serious dangers of an economic downturn,'' according to the fund's
new ``World Economic Outlook'' distributed this week.
   The fund, a consortium of 151 governments including the United
States, says continued high U.S. deficits could trigger world
market reactions that would sharply reduce U.S. growth, cut
spending, output and investment in other industrial countries, and
make further shifts in the value of the dollar and other currencies.
   All this could occur with or without a stock market decline, it
adds.
   The fund calculates that last fall's crash is costing the United
States half of one percentage point of growth _ equal to about $20
billion _ this year and the same amount in 1989.
   It said Third World countries could suffer because a slowdown of
growth in the industrial world would reduce the demand for the raw
materials they produce. At the same time, the poorer countries
would cut their imports but their exports would also fall, reducing
the income available to keep up with payments on their debts.
   The fund says the U.S. deficit was cut by 2 percent in the year
that ended last Sept. 30, without any significant harm to business.
This year, it points out, there will be increased help to U.S.
business from higher exports.

<HEAD>Jackson Goes To Hollywood, Says He's `Hot on the Heels' of Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, campaigning in the state with
the nation's biggest delegate prize, declared he is ``hot on the
heels'' of Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson arrived Thursday afternooon in California and took a
stroll through historic Olvera Street, site of the old Los Angeles
mission church and a center of Hispanic culture.
   Later he hobnobbed with celebrities at a Hollywood fund raiser
where about 200 people paid $100 each to hear him speak.
   Among those attending were Lloyd Bridges, Eileen Brennan, Tony
Franciosa and Dennis Weaver, who said he supports Jackson because
he will bring a ``love ethic'' to Washington.
   Jackson gave a preview on Olvera Street of the issues he will be
emphasizing as he campaigns for California's June 7 primary
election.
   He spoke against the movement to make English the offiical
language of the United States, and discussed immigration, the
strife in Central America, U.S.-Mexico relations and his proposal
to raise the minimum wage.
   In a chaotic crowd that gathered by Jackson's bus on Olvera
Street, a couple of hecklers revived controversy that dogged
Jackson in New York, where Jackson's sometimes shaky relations with
the Jewish community were spotlighted.
   The hecklers shouted ``Lose, Jesse, lose,'' and ``Welcome to
Hymietown,'' a reference to the offensive term Jackson used for New
York in his 1984 presidential campaign.
   But a man nearby shouted, ``Win it for the minorities anyway,
Jesse.''
   Polls have shown Jackson trailing Dukakis badly in California,
but campaign officials said they are looking at the state as a
wide-open contest where Jackson can make inroads among minority
groups, gays and other interest groups.
   Despite Dukakis' increasing delegate lead over him, Jackson told
an impromptu gathering at El Paseo Mexican restaurant on Olvera
Street: ``We are hot on his heels and we're getting stronger as the
days get longer.''
   Former state health chief Mario Obledo, who heads Latinos For
Jackson, said ``California is our best state ever. I feel fairly
confident we're going to win this state.''
   Jackson is expected to have an uphill fight for the Hispanic
vote, with many Hispanics impressed by Dukakis' fluent Spanish.
   Across from where Jackson spoke, a shop on Olvera Street boasted
a Dukakis poster in the window.
   To cast a positive light on his progress, after a string of
losses to Dukakis, Jackson is stressing the popular vote so far,
rather than the delegate race.
   ``Dukakis has 37 percent. We have 29 percent,'' he told the
Hollywood fund raiser.
   ``We're within striking distance. We will win this campaign
because hope has been reborn,'' he said.
   Dukakis' delegate lead is much larger than the popular vote gap,
with Jackson trailing him by more than 500 delegates, out of the
2,081 needed to win the nomination.
   In the past two days, Jackson began to make an issue of the
disparity although party rules allow for states to set up
delegate-selection systems that are not directly proportionate to
the popular vote.
   Jackson on Thursday urged that so-called super delegates and at
large delegates _ those not chosen by voters directly _ show
``fairness'' by committing to candidates who won the popular vote
in their congressional districts.
   Party officials should step in and make sure there is a
reasonable correlation betwen popular vote and delegates, he said.
He urged that super delegates not get on the Dukakis bandwagon
before the primaries are over.
   Jackson warned that his supporters may not vote for a Democrat
in November if they feel ``their vote does not count.''
   ``The most positive consequence of being fair is that people are
inspired ... When people are inspired and diligent, they work
diligently,'' he said. If they don't think they are treated fairly,
however, he said, ``they get discouraged.''
   Jackson said he was not seeking rule changes as he did in 1984,
but that he was instead talking of ``a matter of rule
interpretation.''

<HEAD>Kissinger Calls French Action On Hostages ``Disgraceful''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
called it ``disgraceful'' that the French government reportedly
made concessions to Iran to win the release of three hostages in
Lebanon.
   Kissinger said Thursday that France's action ``raises the risk
for all other nationalities ... because now the Iranians will
undoubtedly believe that they can make similar deals with other
nations and it will be a gory extended effort to prove that they
can't.''
   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for the
hostages' release but others accused the country of dealing with
terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage. Reports said
that in exchange for the three Frenchmen, France agreed to pay the
outstanding balance on a loan originally totaling $1 billion made
by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   ``I think the French action today is disgraceful,'' Kissinger
said.
   He added that while it would it wouldn't feasible to engage in
economic reprisals against France, ``I would think that it should
effect those relationships over which we have some discretion.
   ``It certainly disappoints me severely that a French prime
minister, a conservative prime minister, would engage in such
actions,'' Kissinger said, referring to Premier Jacques Chirac.
   Kissinger appeared on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program along with
former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who was involved
in the secret Iran-Contra negotiations to win the release of
Americans held in Lebanon, and Peggy Say, sister to American
hostage Terry Anderson. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage in Lebanon.
   McFarlane said there are no moderate officials to deal with in
Iran and that to ``literally deal with the devil for whatever
short-term gain it might get us would only encourage ... the taking
of more hostages.''
   Mrs. Say said that while it is easy to discuss theories of
foreign policy, ``my job has to be the voice for Terry Anderson and
the other hostages whose voices can't be heard.''
   ``These are American lives and it seems to me that there has to
be a better way,'' she said. ``I think there ... are better answers
than doing nothing and just literally turning our backs on these
men and saying, `We're sorry .. if they have to die but we have to
stop terrorism.'''

<HEAD>All Signs From Dukakis Point To Fall Matchup With Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today began a short vacation from
the campaign trail after urging voters in Nebraska and West
Virginia to support him in Tuesday's primaries and his expected
fall campaign against George Bush.
   ``We are not conceding one state to the Republicans this fall,''
Dukakis said at his last campaign stop Thursday in Omaha, Neb.,
repeating a pledge he made earlier in West Virginia and again in
Indiana during a refueling stop.
   ``We have a very, very good chance of winning this election,''
the likely Democratic nominee said in Indiana, which gave him a big
primary victory last week. ``We will contest in every one of the 50
states.''
   The Massachusetts governor returned to Boston late Thursday. He
was to work at the statehouse today before taking the first weekend
off from campaigning since Christmas.
   Dukakis, known for his caution, had until Thursday been careful
to mention his continuing competition from Democrat Jesse Jackson.
But Dukakis began and ended his day Thursday with assaults on the
vice president and mentioned Jackson only as an afterthought.
   He repeatedly attacked Bush's assertion he would be the
``education president'' and also said Bush had sat by as the Reagan
administration allowed corporate raiders to engage in ``merger
mania'' that cost 500,000 jobs.
   After emerging from a tour of a coal mine in ecomomically
depressed West Virginia, Dukakis and United Mine Workers President
Rich Trumka said Reagan and Bush had turned their back on
struggling regions of the country.
   ``I believe very deeply that the president of the United States
has a responsibility to all people in all parts of the country,''
Dukakis told a group of miners. ``We need a president who
understands what economic leadership is.'' West Virginia has the
second-highest unemployment rate in the country.
   Inside the mine, Dukakis operated a huge machine and said he
would suggest building coal-fired power plants near the mines, with
the electricity to be sold to energy-dependent areas of the country.
   ``You don't need an evacuation plan when you build a coal-fired
plant,'' said Dukakis, who has blocked the opening of a nuclear
power plant in New Hampshire by refusing to submit a required
evacuation plan for Massachusetts communities within 10 miles of
the plant.
   Dukakis also said he hopes to receive ``good give-and-take''
from his Cabinet, another dig at Bush, who said Wednesday he
sometimes keeps quiet at White House meetings ``because I don't
want the president to have to be choosing between his vice
president and the other members of the Cabinet.''
   Dukakis scoffed at that stance.
   ``I have a lively Cabinet, and sometimes they get loud and
contentious,'' he said. ``That's the way you get good
give-and-take. ... I hope I'll have a vice president who speaks up
and speak out.''
   Earlier, Dukakis challenged Bush's claim that he would be an
``education president'' and said the White House must always be an
advocate for education _ ``not just during election years.''
   Although Dukakis has said he welcomes competition from Jackson,
he dropped his standard reference to Jackson from a line he
frequently uses to close his speeches.
   In recent weeks, Dukakis has marveled that the two remaining
Democrats are ``the son of Greek immigrants and a black man who
grew up poor in South Carolina.''
   But on Thursday he concluded his speech in Charleston by saying,
``The best America is a nation where, with your help, the son of
Greek immigrants can seek _ and win _ the presidency.''
   He delivered the same line again in Omaha and added: ``I believe
I will.''
   Also Thursday, the Dukakis campaign released federal tax returns
that showed the governor and his wife, Kitty, had joint income of
$108,957 last year and paid $25,892 in federal taxes.

<HEAD>Research Hints At Covert Dumping Of Nuclear Waste In California
Lake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of an environmental group dedicated
to protecting California's Mono Lake says research suggesting
radioactive waste might have been dumped there raises questions
about how nuclear waste is being handled.
   ``It's obviously of grave concern and a major public policy
question,'' says Martha Davis, director of the Mono Lake Committee
in Los Angeles. ``I'd be very interested in what the response of
government officials is going to be to this.''
   On Thursday, researchers said measurements of historical levels
of radioactive carbon in the remote California lake suggest that
nuclear waste may have been secretly dumped there in the 1950s and
perhaps again in the 1970s.
   ``We think radiocarbon had to be added to that lake in large
quantities,'' said Wallace Broecker of Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y.
   His study is in the current issue of Earth and Planetary Science
Letters.
   Davis calls the finding ``a question of public policy ... how
well we're handling our waste.''
   The researchers used various techniques to rule out other
possible sources of radioactive carbon, such as atmospheric testing
of atomic bombs. ``Increases found in other nearby lakes and in the
ocean can be attributed to the bomb testing, but Mono Lake's
increase is far too great for that,'' Broecker said in a telephone
interview.
   Mono Lake is one of the nation's most important bird
sanctuaries, a scenic wonder that attracts millions of birds and
hundreds of thousands of human visitors each year, Davis said. She
said the birds either make their homes there or use the lake as a
way station during migrations. It is dotted with strange columns of
tufa, a limestone rock built up from calcium deposited by the lake.
   The principal threat to the lake is the diversion of water
upstream to supply Los Angeles. The radioactive dumping that
Broecker and his colleagues think is likely to have taken place
poses no threat to humans or wildlife at the lake, Broecker said.
The radiation levels are too low.
   Residents of Los Angeles drink water from streams supplying the
lake, not from the lake itself, which is extremely salty.
   The lake's levels of the radioactive form of carbon known as
carbon-14 have increased by 60 percent since the mid-1950s,
Broecker said _ about four times more than would have been expected
from fallout from atomic bomb tests.
   The radioactive waste that Broecker thinks was dumped there
could have come from radioactive samples used in medicine, from
nuclear reactors or from nuclear weapons research, Broecker said.
   ``In the 1950s, people had lots of these things, and what were
they doing with them? We know what they were doing with chemical
wastes _ they were stashing them any place they could,'' Broecker
said.
   Broecker is a geochemist. His study was intended to examine the
exchange rate of gases, such as carbon dioxide, back and forth
between the lake and the atmosphere.
   Karl Turekian, chairman of the department of geology at Yale
University and editor of the journal in which the study appears,
said Broecker's suggestion that radioactive waste was dumped in the
lake ``is a very reasonable speculation.''
   Broecker's study involved measurement of ordinary carbon and of
carbon-14, among many other observations. Similar measurements were
made at Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake in Nevada, which are in some
respects similar to Mono Lake.
   ``Mono Lake puzzled us because it gave a really aberrant
result,'' Broecker said.
   Broecker and his colleagues, including Scott Stine, a
post-doctoral fellow at Lamont-Doherty, found that they could
reconstruct historical levels of carbon-14 in the lake by measuring
the carbon-14 deposited along its shoreline.
   Each year the lake has shrunk in size and leaves deposits of
calcium carbonate on a new shoreline. Those shorelines record the
shrinking of the lake the way tree rings record a tree's growth.
Samples can be taken from various dated shorelines and used to
provide a record of the carbon content of the lake at that time,
Broecker said.
   The carbon-14 levels jumped between 1952 and 1958, and again, by
a smaller amount, between 1966 and 1977, Broecker said. The later
increase could represent a second dumping of radioactive waste, or
it could be the result of corrosion of canisters of waste dumped in
the 1950s, he said.

<HEAD>Broadway Actor George Rose Dies In Car Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British actor George
Rose, who won Broadway's Tony award for ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Drood,'' died when his car swerved into a ditch and flipped over
in this Caribbean resort, police said.
   He was 68.
   Police said the accident occurred about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday
less than a mile east of Puerto Plata, but authorities were not
aware of it until the vehicle was found at 6 a.m. Thursday.
   Police officer Jose Nunez said Rose apparently was alone and
that the car was traveling at high speed when it swerved off the
road and into a ditch, rolling over several times. He said Rose
died instantly.
   Nunez said Rose was traveling west from the seaside town of
Sosua, where he had a home, to nearby Puerto Plata on the north
coast of the Dominican Republic 160 miles northwest of the capital,
Santo Domingo. He was taken to the Ricardo Limardo Hospital in
Puerto Plata.
   Rose, considered an archetype of the British character actor,
had lived in New York City since 1961. He won Broadway's coveted
Antoinette Perry award in 1976 as best actor in a musical for his
performance in a revival of ``My Fair Lady.'' In 1986, he won a
second Tony for his star role in ``Drood.''
   The resourceful, inventive Rose was equally at home in drama,
comedy and musicals. He attributed his versatility to ``an interest
that ranges widely over a number of things'' and to ``a solid
belief in technique.''
   George Walter Rose was born on Feb. 19, 1920, in Bicester,
England, about 12 miles north of Oxford. He was the only child of
Eva Sarah Rose and Walter John Alfred Rose, a butcher and farmer.
   He attended classes at Trinity College of Music in London and
later studied for the stage at the Central School of Speech and
Drama.
   From a school bulletin board notice, he secured a part-time
position as an offstage singer in Tyrone Guthrie's ``Peer Gynt.''
   From then on, he learned his craft mostly in the Old Vic Company
and other English classical repertory companies.
   He served three years in the British military during World War
II and was discharged for medical reasons.
   Rose made his American debut with the Old Vic in 1946 in the
role of Peto in a production of ``Henry IV,'' but first attracted
national attention in 1961 for his portrayal of the Common Man in
``A Man for All Seasons,'' a role that called for him to assume
eight different guises.
   In 1964, his interpretation of the First Gravedigger in a
production of ``Hamlet'' starring Richard Burton was singled out as
the play's highlight.
   His later roles included Alfred P. Doolittle, the roistering
Cockney father of Liza Doolittle in 1968 and 1976 revivals of ``My
Fair Lady''; the effeminate Henry in ``My Fat Friend'' with Lynn
Redgrave (1974); Captain Hook in a 1979 revival of ``Peter Pan,''
with Sandy Duncan; Maj. Gen. Stanley in a 1981 run of ``The Pirates
of Penzance,'' with Linda Ronstadt, and ``The Mystery of Edwin
Drood.''
   He played the Chairman in ``Drood,'' as the play was later
rechristened, introducing the characters and playing two of them
himself.
   Rose had scores of film and television roles to his credit, but
was in his element before a live audience.
   He was quoted as telling The New York Times in an interview in
1983: ``When I have a stage to go on, it's like putting a fish in
water.''
   His first movie appearance was as the Coachman in the
British-made film ``The Pickwick Papers'' in 1952.
   He went on to play character role in more than 30 films,
including ``A Night To Remember'' (1958); ``Hawaii'' (1966); ``A
New Leaf'' (1971), and the film version of ``The Pirates of
Penzance.''
   TV credits included the ``Beacon Hill'' series on CBS and NBC's
``Holocaust.''

   One-third of the 6,000-worker force
at a textile plant in the southern Kosovo province went on strike
and were demanding a 50-percent pay increase, the state Tanjug news
agency reported.
   The strikers, spinners and weavers at the plant in the town of
Djakovica, walked off the job Wednesday, the agency reported
Thursday.
   The plant's workers' council and municipal officials decided to
increase wages by 30 percent retroactive to April 1, but the
workers were not satisfied.
   The government lifts a price freeze on May 15, when prices are
expected to increase by up to 70 percent.
   Communist Yugoslavia was plagued by an unprecedented 150,000
strikes last year and the non-aligned nation is plagued by 170
percent inflation.

<HEAD>Arkansas Governor To Announce Dukakis Endorsement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton says he will
endorse Massachusetts Gov. Miicheal Dukakis for the Democratic
nomination for president today but denies he has any interest in
the vice presidential nomination.
   ``Dukakis needs a Southern senator as a running mate, not
another governor. I consider him a very good friend, and I have
confidence in him,'' Clinton said Thursday during a speech at the
Valencia Community College Foundation annual banquet.
   Clinton added that he planned to endorse Dukakis today in
Arkansas.
   Remarking on Newsweek magazine's ``scratching'' him as a vice
presidential contender, Clinton said that he should not have been
on the list in the first place.

<HEAD>Family Farmer Would Be Dukakis Ag Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis says he would choose a family farmer as his secretary of
Agriculture.
   In an interview before a rally at the National Guard Armory,
Dukakis said the person whom he would choose to take the
Cabinet-level agriculture post would have plenty of hands-on
experience.
   ``I'm talking about somebody who knows what it means to farm and
earn a living,'' said the Massachusetts governor in a brief
campaign appearance Thursday.
   He said he would choose ``someone who understands the importance
of family farming, who could work with me and the Congress to help
shape an agricultural policy that emphasizes the importance of
family farmers.''
   Dukakis said his farm policy would differ from the Reagan
administration's, which he said ``seems to suggest they favor a
totally free economy.''
   ``I don't know anybody who knows anything about farming who
thinks you can do that. We are going to need a combination of
supply management and reasonable price supports in the foreseeable
future.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
whose budget problems at home have become an issue in his
presidential campaign, took his top state budget aide on the road
this week.
   Massachusetts Secretary of Administration and Finance Frank
Keefe accompanied Dukakis to New Jersey and New York on Wednesday
night and remained with the governor for campaign swings Thursday
through West Virginia and Nebraska. Both states hold presidential
primaries on Tuesday.
   Dukakis has been forced to roll back funding this fiscal year
because revenue collections are running below projections and also
has said he will be forced to trim spending his proposed budget for
the fiscal year beginning July 1.
   ``We've been able to get a little work done on the plane between
stops,'' Keefe said. He declined to be more specific.
   Keefe, one of the governor's top statehouse advisers, said he
had been planning for some time to take a campaign trip with
Dukakis.

<HEAD>Mexican-American Parade and Jackson Appearance OK</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials say Democratic presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson can be the grand marshal of an annual
Mexican-American parade without threatening public funding of the
event as long as organizers agree in writing by noon today that it
is not a partisan political rally.
   The Mission Economic and Cultural Association, organizers of
Saturday's Cinco de Mayo parade, which celebrates the Mexican
army's defeat of invading French forces in Mexico in 1862, agreed
Wednesday it would make a ``good faith effort'' to keep partisan
politics out of the event.
   ``We agree with it in principle,'' said Roberto Hernandez,
director of the Mission association. ``The fine tuning we'll have
to work out.''
   ``People have a right to come with signs or T-shirts (bearing
Jackson's name or likeness) or whatever, as long as it isn't part
of officially sanctioned activities,'' said Kary Schulman, director
of The City Grants for the Arts program.
   She added that the Mission association must agree that it would
not sanction signs or banners and that no partisan speeches will be
made. If so, about $11,000 in city funds from a local hotel tax
will be available to cover the parade's costs.

<HEAD>Mrs. Dukakis Works Behind the Scenes to Spruce Up Public Places</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts first lady Kitty Dukakis, wife of
the Democratic presidential front-runner, was paid $20,000 last
year for her part-time position as director of a novel program at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
   According to tax documents made public Thursday, Mrs. Dukakis'
earnings accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total 1987 joint
income of $108,957 she and Gov. Michael Dukakis reported.
   Mrs. Dukakis was the founder in 1985 of the Program on Public
Space Partnerships, a department of the Kennedy School that tries
to bring together business, government and neighbors in cooperative
projects to spruce up the appearance of public places. As director,
she draws a half-time salary of $20,000 annually.
   According to Renee Robin, the program's executive director, Mrs.
Dukakis approached Kennedy School Dean Graham Allison in 1985,
expressing her ``long-standing concern over the deteriorating
condition of public spaces in Massachusetts, ranging from downtown
plazas to larger conservation areas.''
   The department was established late in 1986, and Mrs. Dukakis
earned $2,500 from the job in that year.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Join Probe Of `Towering Inferno' Skyscraper Blaze</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents will join the investigation of
the $450 million fire that killed one man, injured 40 other people
and incinerated four floors of California's tallest skyscraper.
   The inferno at the 62-story First Interstate Bank tower spread
so quickly that fire officials are citing a ``flashover effect,'' a
phenomenon in which materials become superheated, causing a
firestorm.
   ``The movie `Towering Inferno' doesn't do this justice,''
firefighter Richard Androtti said during the fire fight early
Thursday, referring to the 1974 movie about a Los Angeles high-rise
fire.
   Fire officials called in the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms because of the severity and scale
of the blaze _ the worst high-rise fire in the city's history, said
Assistant Fire Chief Peter Lucarelli.
   The request doesn't necessarily mean arson is suspected, but
rather that there is a need for the ATF's technical expertise, said
Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   The 859-foot-tall skyscraper lacked a sprinkler system because
it was built in 1973, a year before the city fire code required
sprinklers. However, the bank had decided to install sprinklers
voluntarily and work on the $3.5 million system was more than 90
percent complete, bank officials said.
   Investigators refused Thursday night to speculate publicly on
the cause of the blaze, and hadn't pinpointed where in the building
it began, Acevedo said.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the fire
began on the 12th floor, which houses the bank's government bond
trading division _ a division the bank said Wednesday it was
selling. It also said it would be laying off 100 workers.
   The blaze, which began late Wednesday night and roared for
nearly four hours, chased night workers to the roof of the
high-rise, where 10 were rescued by helicopters as a ring of flames
roiled around the 12th through 15th floors. Others fled down stairs
in thick smoke.
   The badly burned body of janitor Alexander Handy, 24, of
Palmdale was found in an elevator stuck on the 12th floor, said
county coroner's spokesman Steve Stewart. The cause of death hadn't
been determined.
   A mechanism that was supposed to return all elevators to the
ground floor in case of fire apparently failed, officials said.
   A cleaning supervisor, Zora Imamovic, 38, of Glendale, said she
and five others made their way from the 58th floor to the roof and
were flown to safety. Over her two-way radio, she said she heard a
man calling for help.
   ``One of the men was saying `Car 33' (a freight elevator) was in
flames and he was screaming `Please help!,''' she said.
   Firefighters wearing air tanks had to lug hoses down stairs from
the roof and up from the ground to attack the flames.
   ``They had 2,000-degree temperatures they were fighting,'' said
Fire Chief Donald Manning, one of the 300 firefighters who battled
the flames. ``The individuals in there were committed so far in on
the fire that they would run out of air, they could not back out.
They had to stay there and fight that fire or they knew, as they
told me, they were gonna die.''
   ``This had a potential of killing a lot of my people.''
   Thirty-seven maintenance workers and three firefighters were
treated for burns or smoke inhalation, officials said.
   On Thursday, Councilman Nate Holden said he would propose an
ordinance requiring fire sprinklers in all city high-rises. More
than 500 buildings classified as high-rises in the nation's
second-largest city lack sprinklers.
   Fire officials said a sprinkler system almost certainly would
have prevented the disaster.
   A potentially greater tragedy was averted because the blaze
occurred at night. During a workday the building is occupied by
3,500 people.
   First Interstate Bancorp, the bank's parent company, continued
securities sales and trading Thursday on the stock market. With
assets of $58.5 billion, First Interstate is the nation's
eighth-largest banking company, with 44 banks and offices in 19
states.

<HEAD>Prisons Report On Cuban Uprising Recommends Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees failed to report early signs of
trouble before two November prison uprisings by Cuban inmates, says
an official report that also blames the State Department for giving
too little notice of a deportation agreement that sparked the
rioting.
   The Justice Department report by a committee from the Bureau of
Prisons and other agencies says the federal prisons had no plans
for dealing with total takeovers, and it recommends several changes
in prison design and management.
   The report to the House Judiciary Committee said that wardens at
the prisons in Atlanta, Ga., and Oakdale, La., failed to secure the
facilities partly because early signs of trouble were not relayed
to them by prison personnel.
   ``Of particular significance at both Oakdale and Atlanta was
inadequate communication among staff, the misinterpretation of
intelligence indicating potential unrest, and the fact that
important information never reached officials at appropriate levels
of authority,'' the report said.
   The rioting was touched off by State Department announcement of
an agreement with Cuba that could have led to deportation of the
inmates, who were prisoners and mental patients among 125,000
Cubans sent to Florida in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   The report blamed the State Department for giving prison
officials only four hours' notice of their public announcement of
the agreement.
   The rioting, which lasted eight days at Oakdale and 11 days at
Atlanta, included the taking of 138 prison employee hostages and
resulted in the death of a detainee. The government estimated the
1,394 inmates at Atlanta and 987 at Oakdale destroyed $64.4 million
in prison property and that it cost $48.9 million to quell the
disturbances and relocate the Cubans.
   The report said the inmates showed ``a remarkably high degree of
organization after taking control of the institutions,''
designating particular inmates as cooks, guards, unit managers and
lieutenants and holding drills.
   The report said emergency plans at both institutions failed to
consider the possibility of institution-wide disturbances, saying
``takeovers as complete as those at Oakdale and Atlanta literally
were unimagined.''
   The report listed 107 recommendations covering such areas as
emergency management, hostage negotiations, equipment inventories,
training, media relations and prison construction.
   It recommended training to help better predict and avoid prison
trouble. Also, it said prisons should be designed so that food
storage areas, records and utility controls are located outside
areas secured for the holding of inmates.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Mayor Dies After Battle With Rare Disease</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates and expands throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard S. Caliguiri, mayor of Pittsburgh
since 1977, died early today at a hospital, according to the
Allegheny County Coroner's Office. He was 56 years old.
   The mayor died at 1:36 a.m. of cardiac amyloidosis, a rare,
incurable disease which deposited dangerous amounts of protein in
his heart and other major organs, according to the coroner's office.
   Caliguiri was taken to Shadyside Hospital around 12:45 a.m. A
paramedic pounded on the mayor's chest and tubes had been inserted
into his mouth, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   Paramedics were called to the mayor's home at 12:10 a.m., the
newspaper said. He was carried from his home about a half-hour
later on a stretcher.
   The mayor's wife Jeanne, and one of his sons, followed the city
ambulance carrying Caliguiri to the hospital, the newspaper said.
   Caliguiri stunned Pittsburgh in October when he disclosed that
he suffered from the non-contagious disease whose cause is unknown.
   Caliguiri became aware that something was wrong with him in
March 1987 when he became dizzy while playing golf. After tests,
doctors determined Caliguiri suffered from the disease but nothing
was said publicly until later that year.
   Last summer, friends and political acquantainces began to notice
that Caliguiri, who was short in stature, looked pale and even
thinner than his normal weight of 140 pounds.
   For a while, he dismissed concern by saying it was only an
intestinal ailment, but finally on Oct. 2, he revealed the true
nature of his illness.
   On Dec. 24, 1987, surgeons at Shadyside Hospital inserted a
pacemaker in Caliguiri's chest to regulate his heartbeat.
   Earlier this week, Dr. James O'Toole, Caliguiri's cardiologist,
said he was evalutaing the possibility ofa heart transplant for the
mayor.
   Caliguiri, a Democrat, first became mayor of Pittsburgh in 1977.
   In addition to his wife, Caliguiri is survived by two sons,
Gregg and David.

<HEAD>Height, Heat and Smoke Hamper Firefighters In High-Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting heat, smoke and flames at dizzying heights like Los
Angeles' 62-story First International Bank building can turn
firefighters into high-rise commandos facing special dangers and
physical punishment.
   ``It's like fighting a bungalow fire 200 feet in the air,'' said
Jerry Lawrence of the Chicago Fire Department, which protects the
1,454-foot tall Sears Tower, the tallest building in the country
and among the most fireproof.
   Skyscraper fires are physically exhausting to put out, with
firefighters huffing up stairs with 50 pounds of equipment and air
tanks on their backs. Reserves are called up often for relief and
to replenish air supplies.
   ``It's a very hazardous, punishing type of fire,'' said Roger
Lanaham of the U.S. Fire Administration in the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. ``You have to have shock troops. It's like a
tough football game. You have to keep bringing in fresh blood.''
   People trapped above the fire must be evacuated, sometimes by
helicopter but preferably down stairwells. And precautions must be
taken to keep those on the street from being showered with
heat-shattered glass.
   Aerial ladders and cranes reach no higher than 10 floors, so
firefighters work the fire from the inside, setting up a staging
area on a floor below the fire. They bring hoses, equipment, first
aid and compressed air. Oxygen is never carried because it can
ignite.
   ``It's a manual operation that takes more personnel than any
other fire. It's also an inside fire. They can't put the fire out
from the outside. That's what makes it so dangerous,'' said Joseph
Redden, spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association in
Quincy, Mass., a former Newark, N.J. fire chief.
   High-rise fires create a chimney effect, sucking heat and smoke
up stairwells and elevator shafts to the top of the building.
Firefighters open bulkheads or smash holes in the roof to prevent
explosive buildups.
   In the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., 74 of the
87 deaths came from smoke inhalation, according to fire officials.
Most victims were found trapped on the top seven floors of the
26-story building.
   Another fire that prompted improved designs and sprinkler
systems was a 1986 blaze that killed 97 people, including 84 on a
first floor casino, at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Three hotel workers pleaded guilty to setting the fire.
   ``In a fire, smoke is usually a killer, not the flames,'' said
John Mulligan, spokesman for the New York City Fire Department. ``A
high-rise fire is going to be hot and smoky and among the most
difficult firefighting conditions.''
   New York has 1,200 high-rises or buildings that are more than 75
feet tall. The city averages one fire per day in a high-rise,
although most are in lower floors and are easily contained,
Mulligan said.
   Firefighters say real life bears little resemblance to the
Hollywood hokum of the movie ``The Towering Inferno,'' in which
most of the stars scrambled to the roof to await rescue.
   ``You never want to get above the fire,'' Redden said. ``That's
the worst place you can be.''

<HEAD>Substance In Saliva Blocks the AIDS Virus, Preliminary Research
Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human saliva contains a factor that blocks the
AIDS virus from infecting cells, indicating the body may have a
natural defense against the deadly disease, preliminary studies
indicate.
   ``Fears about kissing, contact with eating implements and so on
could be dispelled by this kind of evidence,'' said Enid Neidle, an
assistant director of the Chicago-based American Dental
Association, which reported the study in the May issue of its
journal.
   Isolating and understanding the inhibitory element in saliva may
help researchers learn how to naturally prevent the transmission of
the virus, said Philip Fox, head of clinical studies at the
National Institute of Dental Research and senior investigator in
the study.
   ``The significance is that it's a demonstration of a natural
defense that people have against the AIDS virus,'' Fox said
Thursday in a telephone interview from the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md.
   The research also provides a biological explanation of why the
mouth isn't a transmission route for the disease, Fox said. That's
good news for dentists and others concerned about catching AIDS
through contact with the saliva of infected people.
   ``This supports biologically what we have been seeing
epidemiologically,'' said Irwin Mandel, director of the Center for
Clinical Research in Dentistry at Columbia University in New York.
``There is essentially no chance of transmission of the virus
through saliva.''
   Fox and four co-workers collected saliva samples from the mouths
of three healthy men and secretions directly from the major
salivary glands.
   None of the three was at risk for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, which destroys the body's defenses against disease and
leaves a person prey to life-threatening infections and certain
cancers.
   The samples were mixed with human immunodeficiency virus-1
(HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, and lymphocytes, immune system
cells that are the major targets for the virus.
   The virus wasn't able to infect the lymphocytes in the saliva or
the secretions from the submandibular and sublingual glands at the
bottom of the mouth, the researchers found.
   However in two of the men, secretions from the parotid salivary
gland near the ear were infected. Secretions from the parotid gland
of the third man were not infected.
   The researchers aren't certain how the inhibitory element works,
but Fox said it may interfere with the receptors through which
white blood cells are infected by the AIDS virus.
   The researchers currently are expanding their work to include
women, children and people infected with AIDS, Fox said.
   The latest study expands on research done two years ago in which
scientists found that the AIDS virus was neutralized by saliva from
humans and chimpanzees, Fox said.
   At the time, researchers didn't know whether the neutralizing
agent was a product of the salivary glands or one of the other
elements of saliva, such as blood components, bacteria or cells.
   The new study shows that the HIV-neutralizing element is a
product of the submandibular and sublingual glands, Mandel said.
   Theoretically, the study results could lead to the discovery of
a natural immunization against AIDS, Mandel said.
   Researchers now must isolate the HIV-neutralizing element in
saliva, find out how it works and then learn how to activate it in
the body as a defense against AIDS, said Mandel, a pioneer in the
study of saliva as a protective factor against disease.
   The AIDS virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to
their infants before or during birth.
   More than 60,000 cases of AIDS and 34,088 AIDS deaths have been
reported in the United States from June 1981 through May 2,
according to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<HEAD>Brown Reverses 19-Year-Old Decision, Adds Course Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brown University has added two more
courses to the number required for graduation, partially reversing
a 19-year-old move to make its curriculum more flexible.
   Students in the Ivy League school's class of 1993 will be
required to pass 30 courses to qualify for a bachelor's degree,
Robert Reichley, vice president for university relations, said
Thursday.
   The current system was adopted as part of a wide-ranging
curriculum reform in 1969. The ``New Curriculum'' cut the
graduation requirement from 32 to 28 courses and abolished
distribution requirements and the grade of ``F.''
   A student who fails a course at Brown does not receive credit
for the course, but the failure is not recorded on his or her
transcript.
   The reforms were intended to allow students to experiment by
taking courses in areas outside their major fields of study without
worrying about failure. Students still paid for 32 courses, but
could fail four without penalty.
   Many students were not using the system as intended, according
to a study conducted by Dean Sheila Blumstein.
   Of the class of 1987, 44 percent took 30 or fewer courses, and
two-thirds of the students graduating with fewer than 32 courses
did not even register for 32, Blumstein found.
   Blumstein and Reichley said the change was essentially a
fine-tuning of the system and does not represent a major retreat.
   Reichley said the change has nothing to do with U.S. Education
Secretary William Bennett's well-publicized call for a return to
basics in U.S. higher education.
   Brown still does not require students to take specific classes
outside their majors or fulfill ``distribution requirements'' by
taking classes in several specified fields, Reichley said. Many top
schools do have those requirements.
   Brown officials have cited the 1969 reforms as one reason the
university has become among the nation's most popular and most
competitive.
   Blumstein said she thinks the tougher graduation requirement
will have little effect on Brown's popularity, and said students
seem to support it.
   The change brings Brown more into line with requirements at
other top universities.
   Harvard requires the equivalent of 32 semester-long classes for
graduation, while Yale requires 36. At Princeton, liberal arts
students are required to take 30 courses and complete a senior
thesis _ an option at Brown _ while engineers are required to take
36.

<TEXT>
   By a slim majority, United Methodist delegates
have called for a boycott of Royal Dutch-Shell petroleum products
until it pulls out of South Africa or apartheid is ended.
   ``Only with the support of international oil corporations can
the apartheid regime survive,'' said the church's governing
conference, asking members to refrain from purchasing Shell
products.
   The narrowly approved action _ by a vote of 475 to 418 _ came
after sharp debate late Thursday in which two Texans strongly
objected, saying Shell actively opposed apartheid and promoted
blacks in jobs, education and housing.
   Others argued for the move, saying ``oil was the fuel of
apartheid,'' and that the company, while verbally opposing
apartheid, did nothing effectively to end it.
   Apartheid is South Africa's system of law and custom which
establishes a racially segregated society in which 5 million whites
deny the nation's 26 million blacks any vote in national affairs.
   In a statement, the U.S. Shell Oil Company expressed
disappointment at the Methodists' action, saying thousands of its
employees who are Methodists ``will find it difficult to
understand.''
   Calling the action a ``discriminatory secondary boycott'' since
the U.S. company itself, a subsidiary, has no investments or
operations in South Africa, the company said:
   The ``individuals who will be hardest hit by a boycott against
Shell are the innocent American service station owners and jobbers
who sell Shell products.''
   As the 11-day conference of the 9.6-million church neared a
close Friday night, it refused to make more strict its rules for
overseeing behavior of clergy.
   It was proposed that the rules be changed to allow a minister to
be put on trial if he refused to cooperate in answering questions,
but this was rejected after opponents said it could lead to
``witch-hunt'' abuses.
   No mention was made in the debate of the case of the Rev. Julian
Rush, a part-time Denver pastor who admits his homosexuality but
refuses to say if he is actively so.
   That, if it were the case, would make him ineligible for the
clergy under church disciplines.
   The conference condemned ``interventions by more powerful
nations against weaker ones,'' declaring:
   ``These actions undermine international law, breed injustice,
frustrate the self-determination of peoples and are responsible for
untold human suffering.''
   Ihstead of military interventions, the church urged regional and
international negotiations and diplomatic efforts such as the
Contadora peace process in Nicaragua to settle disputes.
   Of the South African situation, the church pledged its own
efforts to end apartheid, calling it ``persistent disobedience to
the Word of God.''
   The denomination adopted a national quadrennial budget of $410
million, amounting to $13.50 annually per member. Most of their
contributions totalling $2.5 billion annually go to work of local
congregations and regional units.

   The sister of captive American journalist
Terry Anderson says the U.S. government has decided ``to let these
men die'' rather than to pursue the release of its hostages as the
French did.
   ``It almost appears that the French government places a higher
priority on the lives of their people,'' Peggy Say said Thursday.
   Three French hostages, including one who said he was a cellmate
of Anderson, were released Wednesday by their pro-Iranian captors.
High-ranking officials of the French government apparently
negotiated for their release.
   The U.S. government, however, refuses to negotiate with
terrorists as a matter of principle and joined Great Britain in
expressing hopes that the French did not make a deal for the
hostages.
   ``I find it rather embarrassing that they would call France to
task for making a deal in view of the fact that this government
sold arms to Iran in a poorly conceived initiative that might have
freed the hostages,'' said Mrs. Say, who has spoken out several
times on behalf of her brother and the eight other American
hostages believed held in Lebanon.
   ``I hope they pursue whatever channels the French used, but I
doubt they will,'' Mrs. Say said. ``I'm not a political wizard ...
but it seems to me that their rationale that they won't negotiate
because they want to bring an end to terrorism ... is irrational.
   ``What they are saying is that they know of no other solution to
this situation than to let these men die,'' she said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held since March 16, 1985, the longest of any
hostage.
   One of the freed French hostages, Marcel Fontaine, said he was
Anderson's cellmate and that he recently played chess and dominoes
with him.
   ``It's good to know Terry is alive, but I'm afraid this doesn't
necessarily mean anything will be forthcoming,'' Mrs. Say said from
her upstate New York home. She said she would fly to Paris this
weekend to meet with Fontaine.
   Earlier, Mrs Say said that the release of the French hostages
was encouraging because she might be able to learn from them about
her brother's condition.
   ``They must have talked and maybe he knows something about what
Terry is thinking,'' she said. ``I'm hoping he can give me some
indication of what I should do next.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Market Down After Three-Day Holiday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar lost nearly half a yen on profit-taking
in Tokyo today as traders awaited the release of U.S. unemployment
figures, while stock prices also declined following a three-day
market holiday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues finished the day at 27,534.39, down 135.33 points,
or 0.49 percent, from Monday's close.
   The dollar, meanwhile, closed the day at 124.88 yen, down 0.45
yen from Monday's ending figure of 125.33 yen.
   Many participants were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the
dollar in anticipation of U.S. unemployment figures for April,
scheduled to be released later today, traders said. They said
profit-taking had contributed to the dollar's decline during the
day.
   The fall in the Nikkei index, the Tokyo stock market's main
barometer, came after four consecutive days of gains ending in a
record-high closing Monday, the last trading day before the
three-day ``Golden Week'' holiday break.
   ``Activity was slow after the holidays and reflected investor
caution over the earlier gains,'' said an official for a major
brokerage.
   The official, who declined to be named, said the market's
fundamentals nevertheless remained strong.
   Volume in the market's first section was 700 million shares, 200
million less than on Monday.
   ``The market reflected the overnight bearishness on Wall Street,
prompted by concern over U.S. inflation,'' said Masahiro Umemori,
an equity researcher at Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   All banks, financial institutions, markets and most businesses
were closed in Japan Tuesday through Thursday because of national
holidays.

<HEAD>Fallen Evangelist Says Ministry `Scraping The Bottom'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, his
television outlets dwindling, says his troubled worldwide ministry
is ``scraping the bottom.''
   As three major cable networks dropped Swaggart's programs, the
embattled minister took to the airwaves this week, not to preach
fire-and-brimestone gospel of his television ministry but to plead
for $6 million.
   ``We have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministry
going,'' Swaggart said during a televised appeal with his wife
Frances and son Donnie. ``Stations will cancel if we cannot pay
them. We cannot pay them what we do not have.''
   Swaggart left the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination, on April 8 after refusing to abide by a
one-year suspension from the pulpit and television for his
confession of moral failure.
   Although Swaggart did not specify his sin during a tearful
confession to his congregation on Feb. 21, two church officials
have said that Swaggart told them a prostitute posed nude for him
while he watched.
   The evangelist has said he plans to return to the pulpit on May
22, in accordance with a three-month suspension ordered by state
denomination officials. That decision was later overturned by
national church leaders.
   In his fund-raising plea, Swaggart said his church faces ``the
most crucial time of any ministry in the history of the world. ...
We are scraping the bottom.''
   One of the cable networks that dropped Swaggart was PTL, which
itself has been rocked by financial losses since former Assemblies
of God minister Jim Bakker stepped down last year after admitting
to adultery.
   PTL earlier had decided to remove Swaggart's programs if he
failed to abide by the one-year suspension. The CBN cable network
canceled Swaggart's programs earlier and Black Entertainment
Television, another cable outlet, dropped the evangelist last week.
The three networks reach about 70 million homes.
   Since his departure from the denomination, contributions to the
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries have dropped sharply, at least
seven ministers in key administrative positions have left and a
state appeals court has said that fellow defrocked evangelist
Marvin Gorman should have his day in court in a lawsuit he filed
against Swaggart.
   The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate reported that after the scandal
broke, contributions fell quickly from $500,000 per day to possibly
below the $350,000 the ministry needs to stay afloat. Ministry
officials have refused to comment.
   Last month, Swaggart's wife and son staged a week-long televised
fundraiser in which they described the ministry's financial
condition as critical. Ministry officials would not say how much
money was raised.
   Swaggart said that regardless of what happens, he will be back
in the pulpit on May 22. ``If May 22 doesn't hurry up and get here,
I am going out behind the house and preach to the frogs,'' he said
with a chuckle.
   Gorman, who reportedly photographed Swaggart outside a seedy
motel with a woman and later turned the pictures over to church
officials, claims in his $190 million suit that Swaggart plotted to
ruin his ministry through a smear campaign accusing him of a series
of adulterous affairs with women he had counseled.

   Duquesne University has named a University of
Pittsburgh law professor to be the school's first lay president in
its 110-year history.
   John E. Murray, 55, will be the first president not to be a Holy
Ghost priest, a member of the order that founded the Catholic
college.
   The appointment announced Thursday ended a nine-month search for
a successor to the Rev. Donald S. Nesti, president since 1980, who
resigned in August.
   Acting president Rolando E. Bonachea will leave Duquesne this
summer to assume the presidency of Salem State College in
Massachusetts.
   Murray earned his undergraduate degree at LaSalle University in
1955. He received law degrees from Catholic University of America
in 1958 and the University of Wisconsin in 1959.
   He has taught law at the University of Pittsburgh since 1986.

<HEAD>U.S. Signals Support for a Provisional Government in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has offered its conditional
support to Afghan rebels who hope to form a provisional government
to rival the Soviet-backed Afghanistan regime, according to a
report published today.
   A State Department official met with Afghan rebel leaders in
Pakistan last week to explain the American position, The New York
Times reported.
   Another top State Department official described the criteria for
American support of a provisional government as ``control of
territory, consent of the people, capacity and willingness to
exercise international obligations, possession of a civil
administrative apparatus that can govern.''
   Such a government ``would have earned recognition from the
international community,'' The Times quoted the official as saying.
   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed agreements in Geneva last month providing for the withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan over the next nine months.
   The Soviet Union has reserved the right to continue its longtime
support of the government in Kabul, but the State Department
official told the Times the Soviet troop withdrawal ``will
inevitably lead to a change of government because ... it's the
Russian presence that keeps the current government in power.''

<HEAD>Fire Breaks Out in House Speaker's Office; No Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An electrical fire that raged unimpeded for 10
minutes caused extensive damage in the Capitol Hill office of House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., whose offices are next door to
Wright's, said the fire which broke out shortly after 6 p.m.
Thursday was able to spread because of a lack of fire hoses and
alarms.
   Weldon, who is a former fire chief, said fire hoses which are
supposed to be in emergency cabinets throughout the building were
missing.
   ``We'd have had the fire out. We knew where it was, we were in
there, and we just couldn't get to it,'' he said ``I guarantee you
I'll raise Cain about it the next time we're in session, which I
guess is Monday.''
   Weldon said he had just formed a congressional fire caucus _ a
group of members concerned about fire prevention issues _ three
months ago, ``because America doesn't have a fire policy.''
   Two U.S. Capitol Police officers were treated for smoke
inhalation at the scene and District of Columbia Deputy Fire Chief
Jamelia Jackson estimated the damages to Wright's second-floor
corner office of the Longworth Building at $120,000.

   Members of a House subcommittee have approved
spending $63 million to reinforce the U.S. Customs Service presence
along the U.S.-Mexico border and improve bridge and border
stations, says Rep. Ron Coleman of El Paso.
   The funding package includes almost $28.7 million for the second
year of the three-year Southwest Border Improvement Program and $35
million to hire 500 new customs agents, Coleman's office said
Thursday.
   ``These projects are essential to improving the flow of trade

safe and secure facilities for Customs, Drug Enforcement
Administration and other law enforcement personnel at the border,''
Coleman said in a statement released by his office.
   The subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General
Goverment, a part of the House Appropriations Committee, approved
the funding late Wednesday and Coleman said he is confident it will
clear Congress.

<TEXT>
   A new U.S. Navy-escorted
convoy sailed south in the Persian Gulf after Iran reasserted the
right to attack unarmed merchant ships as a tactic in its war with
Iraq.
   The Williams took over escort duty in the northern gulf from the
frigate USS Sides over two Kuwaiti-owned, American-flagged
80,000-ton oil tankers, the Chesapeake City and Ocean City.
   Operating under President Reagan's new orders to extend
protection to non-U.S. flagged ships, the 3,700-ton guided missile
frigate rendezvoused at midday Thursday with the Sides, which
cruised alongside the loaded tankers from Kuwait at the northern
edge of the gulf.
   Led by a Cobra attack helicopter scanning the seas for mines,
the Williams escorted the tankers as they headed for the Strait of
Hormuz at the southern end of the gulf on a two-day trip.
   No tag-alongs were spotted from the deck of the frigate, but the
three-thip convoy may find some. Neutral merchant ships frequently
seek safety in numbers in the gulf.
   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke told a Pentagon media pool on the
Williams that the new rules will allow the 28 warships Washington
has sent to the region to protect any neutral ship attacked as long
as it was not carrying cargo for use by Iran or Iraq, who have been
at war for 7{ years.
   ``The master has to certify to us by radio that it is not
carrying any belligerent cargo before we can help,'' he said, as
one of several conditions.
   Iran said in a statement Tuesday that it is justified in firing
on unarmed merchant ships. Parliament speaker Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani was quoted in news reports as saying the raids were
conducted only against Iran's accomplices in the war.
   Despite the heated rhetoric, Iran has yet to test the new U.S.
policy afer its April 18 sea battles with U.S. forces that sank or
damaged six Iranian vessels.
   Officers aboard this ship, which played a key role in last
month's fighting, said they are worried most about running into an
underwater mine planted by Iran.
   ``They don't even have to lay them, just threaten to lay them,''
said Williams' captain, Cmdr. Edward Mann. All day Thursday,
crewmen took hourlong mine watch turns, tethered to keep them from
being hurtled overboard. With M-60 automatic weapons at the ready
they peered through high-powered binoculars from the bow of the
ship trying to spot mines ahead.
   Mann and other officers said they were not very concerned about
an NBC News report from Washington that quoted intelligence sources
as saying Iran was massing more than 100 speedboats near Hormuz for
a possible attack. Iran has used speedboats for attacks on ships in
the past.
   ``It could mean anything. Who knows what they are up to,'' said
one officer when asked about the report. Another officer dismissed
it, saying: ``They are likely to do anything, so your guess is as
good as mine.''
   Iran has threatened revenge for the April 18 battle.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told the Pentagon pool earlier this week that Iran's threats
are still taken very seriously.
   No new mines have been found since the April 18 sea battle and
no engagements or harassments have been reported by the Navy.
   An officer said a mine captured last September from the Iran Ajr
warship cost only $500 to make because it was a simple model based
on a 1908 Russian mine.
   ``Five hundred bucks,'' he said. ``Not a bad return on your
investment. Five hundred dollars to blow a $500 million ship.''

<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government charged that
Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras broke a 6-week-old cease-fire
with a speedboat attack on a military position.
   The Foreign Ministry also alleged Thursday that a CIA operation
based in Costa Rica published false documents to tarnish the image
of the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   Also Thursday, 42 striking workers ended a 10-day fast in
Managua after the government agreed to begin salary negotiations
Monday, union leaders said.
   In Honduras, military spokesman Manuel Suarez Benavides said six
dissident members of the Contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels are
known, detained earlier in the week were expelled from Honduras and
placed on a commercial flight Thursday to Miami. Relatives said
they have disappeared.
   In its first bulletin since Sandinista and U.S.-backed Contra
forces stopped offensive military operations on March 21, the
Defense Ministry said two Contra speedboats based at a Honduran
naval base in the Gulf of Fonseca fired machine guns and rifles at
military position Wednesday ``without obtaining results.''
   Sandinista troops retaliated by firing 57-mm cannon at the
boats, the ministry said. It provided no further details.
   There was no immediate comment from the rebels.
   Government and Contra representatives signed a temporary truce
on March 23, and a 60-day cease-fire began April 1. Two rounds of
negotiations in Managua have yielded no accord to end the
6{-year-old civil war.
   Alejandro Bendanda, secretary-general of the Foreign Ministry,
told a news conference Thursday that a clandestine CIA center in
San Jose, Costa Rica, had circulated at least eight false documents
recently, seeking to discredit the Sandinista government.
   In San Jose, a person answering the phone at the Costa Rican
government's Organization of Judicial Investigation said the agency
had no knowledge of any such activity. The person refused to give a
name.
   On Thursday afternoon, officials of the General Workers
Federation declared the 10-day hunger strike a success. The fast
``restored dignity to workers,'' said Alejandro Solarsano, a
federation leader.
   The 42 construction workers and car mechanics began the fast
April 25 to support a wage strike the union claims has been
supported by 4,500 workers since Feb. 25.
   Solarsano said four of those participating in the fast were
taken to a hospital for treatment.
   Federation director Carlos Salgado told a news conference that
the government had cut off water supplies to the federation
headquarters and prevented relatives of the strikers from bringing
medical supplies inside.
   Rolando Velasquez, secretary of labor relations for the
federation, said the workers would continue the job walkout ``until
the demands of the working class are obtained.''
   Sandinista police have detained more than 70 people since the
hunger strike began.
   In Miami, Marsha Lacayo, the wife of missing Contra adviser
Donald Lacayo, said there ``is no doubt'' that Contra military
commander Enrique Bermudez was responsible for the detainment of
the rebel officials.
   Some of the missing men had accused Bermudez of corruption.
Bermudez has been at the center of a bitter power struggle within
Contra ranks for several weeks.
   Bermudez on Thursday denied having any information about Lacayo,
Enrique Sanchez, Alejandro Montealegre, a rebel pilot identified
only as Waikita, Walter Calderon Lopez, known as Commander Tono, or
Tirzo Ramon Moreno, known as Commander Rigoberto.
   Manuel Suarez Benavides, a Honduran military spokesman, said
Thursday that the rebel officials were put on an Eastern Airlines
flight to Miami because ``the Contras must resolve their internal
affairs outside of our national territory.''

   The request was made by Carbide lawyer Fali Nariman, who
contended in a petition that Deo showed bias by ordering on Dec. 17
that the corporation pay ``interim relief'' to victims before
ruling on the merits of the suit.
   ``The order was not only without jurisdiction but wholly
arbitrary, perverse and displays a complete pre-judgment,'' Nariman
said.
   Deo said the petition was unusual, since such requests normally
are made to a higher court. But he scheduled a hearing for June 16
on the matter.
   The court recesses Saturday for summer vacation and returns June
13.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and at least 20,000 seriously
injured when toxic methyl-isocyanate leaked from a pesticide plant
run by a subsidiary of Union Carbide in Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984.
   Bhopal is the capital of the central Indian state of Madhya
Pradesh.
   Deo is the fourth judge in the case. The first was promoted to
the high court and the second withdrew after a serious auto injury.
The third judge, G.S. Patel, was transferred to another court by
the Indian government after it was disclosed that he had filed a
claim in the case.
   Vepa Sarthy, a lawyer for the Indian government, accused Union
Carbide of filing its petition ``with a view to delay the case.''
   Lawyer Vibhuti Jha, a court-recognized ``intervener'' on behalf
of voluntary relief organizations helping the gas victims, urged
the judge to reject Carbide's request. He described it as stalling.
   Deo's December order that Union Carbide pay interim relief to
the gas victims was upheld by the Madhya Pradesh High Court on
April 4. The High Court set the amount of payment at $192 million.
   Union Carbide earlier this week asked the High Court to review
its decision.
   The multinational company, with headquarters in Danbury, Conn.,
also faces criminal charges in connection with the gas leak.
   India contends the gas leak was caused by negligence. The
company has said it resulted from sabotage by a distruntled
employee.

   Climbers from China, Japan and Nepal who staged a
successful rendezvous on Mount Everest's summit were making
progress today in descending the world's tallest peak, the
expedition's leader said.
   When nine of the climbers met on top of the world Thursday, they
achieved two mountaineering firsts: simultaneously scaling Everest
from two sides and making a live telecast from the summit.
   Three other expedition members later reached the summit.
   Shi Zhanchun, the expedition's leader and president of the
Chinese Mountaineering Association, told a news conference that
eight of the climbers who met on the 29,028-foot summit had reached
a camp at 27,224 feet on the north, or Chinese Tibetan, side of the
mountain this morning.
   He said the ninth had descended to 25,551 feet.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency also reported from Katmandu,
Nepal, that Cering Doje of Tibet, Noboru Yamada of Japan and Ang
Lhakpa Sherpa of Nepal reached a camp at 26,174 feet on the south,
or Nepalese, face of Everest.
   The three, who had climbed from the north side, and three others
who made the ascent from the south and were going down the north
face, are attempting to be the first to complete an
across-the-mountain climb.
   Shi said the climbers who met at the summit will not proclaim
victory until they have reached the 21,320-foot level. The descent
is treacherous and there is still danger of climbers suffering
frostbite, he said.
   The expedition is the largest ever to attempt to climb Everest,
with more than 200 people participating. The teams began their
assaults last month.
   Japan's Nihon Television Corp. engineered the alpine telecasts,
which have been beamed by satellite and televised in China, Japan
and Nepal. NTV has paid most of the cost of the $12.5 million
expedition.
   In Tokyo, an NTV spokeswoman said a nine-member group, including
three network cameramen, were scaling the mountain from the
northern side today, while three others climbed from the southern
side.
   She added that more expedition members planned to reach the
summit of the Himalayan peak that straddles the Nepal-China border.
She did not have further details.
   The expedition was staged to honor the 35th anniversary of the
first successful Everest assault, by Sir Edmund Hillary of New
Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, his sherpa guide, on May 29, 1953.
   The conquering of the mountain the Chinese call Qomolangma was
the top news story on television in Beijing and was the lead story,
with large pictures, on the front page of all major dailies today.
   Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Thursday telephoned a television
studio to congratulate the ``great pioneers'' of the three nations.

   A Chinese man dressed in a ``dapper''
pinstriped suit stepped out of a cramped baggage container after a
15-hour flight to freedom from Beijing, astonishing airport
officials who said he was lucky to survive.
   ``All he wanted was political asylum and freedom,'' Ron Wilson,
community relations officer at San Francisco International Airport,
said Thursday. ``You would expect a guy to be dead when he
arrived.''
   Wilson said that instead of luggage, a baggage handler on
Wednesday found a nattily clad Cheng Guajun in the five-foot-square
storage container in the belly of a Boeing 747 belonging to the
official airline of China.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service district director David
Ilchert would not say whether the man asked for asylum. However, he
did say bilingual officers were interviewing him to find out his
intentions.
   ``He looked pretty dapper as soon as he got some fresh air,''
said Joseph F. Brandon, chief of investigations for the INS in San
Francisco. ``He seemed calm and collected in his thoughts. He
wasn't really emotional.''
   Cheng, 33, who said he ate a candy bar he brought with him for
the trip, told immigration investigators after he arrived Wednesday
that he had watched airport workers in China loading baggage into
the containers for several days before deciding to hide in one.
   Wilson characterized the plan as daring, but foolhardy, since
baggage compartments are not all pressurized and a person inside
one could die from exposure.
   The hold were the container was placed was a temperate 65
degrees. The cargo holds on a Boeing 747 can range from 38 up to 85
degrees, depending on the location in the plane.
   Cheng said he was employed as an accountant by a chemical
company in Tianjin, a major industrial city and port in northeast
China.
   Cheng reportedly told INS investigators he had not been able to
get a student visa to the United States because he could not prove
he had a financial sponsor here. Cheng said he has an uncle in Los
Angeles who would sponsor him.

<TEXT>
   One by one, the names of the 15 dead were
read aloud in court as a young man tearfully pleaded innocent to
murder and arson charges in a fire that engulfed a crowded rooming
house nearly four years ago.
   James Carver, a 24-year-old former truck driver, pleaded
innocent in an unsteady voice after each count. Once he broke down
in tears, holding up his arraignment Thursday for 15 minutes.
   The Ipswich man was ordered held on bail of $1 million surety or
$100,000 cash by Salem Superior Court Judge Peter Brady.
   Prosecutors allege that Carver set the July 4, 1984, predawn
fire, lighting gasoline-soaked newspapers in a doorway at the
Elliott Chambers boarding house in Beverly in a jealous rage over a
crumbling love affair.
   Jealous over his fiancee dating a tenant at the rooming house,
Carver set the fire that raced through the turn-of-the-century
wooden building, said Essex County District Attorney Kevin Burke.
   The blaze raged out of control for more than two hours. It
trapped six people in their rooms and killed others while they
tried to break down a locked exit. One man jumped from a
third-story window to his death and another man died several days
later in a hospital.
   Burke told reporters after the arraignment Carver's rival died
in the blaze, but he would not identify the man or name Carver's
then-fiancee. Burke said Carver later met his wife MaryJane, 21.
   Carver, indicted last week by an Essex County grand jury, was
arrested Wednesday as he drove from an Ipswich drug store with his
wife and their 6-week-old daughter Kaitlyn, who reportedly has
serious health problems.
   Burke said Carver had been a suspect during the four-year
investigation, but became the principal target last year after a
person revealed Carver had admitted to setting the fire. Burke
would not identify the source.
   Carver, who was identified in an April 21 police lineup ordered
by the grand jury, was reported to be outside the rooming house
around the time of the fire by several witnesses, Burke said.
   Defense attorney Dennis Jackson said Carver's parents have told
police their son was ill and asleep at their Danvers home the
morning of the fire.
   A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for May 23.
   If convicted, Carver faces a mandatory life sentence for each
murder count and up to 20 years for the arson charge.

   A Hong Kong judge today sentenced an Israeli
businessman to two years in jail for possessing falsified passports
that reportedly allowed Israeli military specialists to enter China
for an arms deal.
   Zvi Gafni, 36, was sentenced three days after he pleaded guilty
to the charge. He made no comment in court.
   Gafni was arrested Dec. 19 as he was leaving for Macao, a
Portuguese colony neighboring the British colony of Hong Kong.
Police later seized five fake Philippine passports from his office.
   The Sunday Times of London reported in April that the passports
were used by five Israeli military specialists who traveled to
China in November. The newspaper said a deal was made to supply the
Chinese armed forces with Israeli-developed missile warheads and
armor-piercing devices.
   China and Israel have no diplomatic relations.
   Israel has denied that it agreed to sell advanced missile
technology to China.

   The whereabouts were unknown early today of five
Contra officials who had expected to be expelled from Honduras, and
one of their wives blamed their disappearance on Contra military
commander Enrique Bermudez.
   Bermudez, who has been at the center of a bitter power struggle
within Contra ranks for several weeks, had been accused by some of
the missing men of corruption and surrounding himself with
supporters of deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
   The men were detained by Honduran security police Tuesday, and
some of the men told their wives after their arrest that they
expected to be expelled from the country Thursday.
   ``There is no doubt that Bermudez is responsible,'' said Marsha
Lacayo, wife of missing Contra military adviser Donald Lacayo.
   Mrs. Lacayo said the men wrote a letter April 16, which was to
be opened in case anything happened to them, blaming Bermudez in
advance for ``any attack on our lives, damages, injuries or
deaths.''
   At a news conference Thursday in Washington, Bermudez denied
having any information about the whereabouts of the missing Contras.
   But they failed to show up at the airport in the Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa and their whereabouts are unknown, Mrs.
Lacayo said here Thursday night.
   However, Honduran authorities said the men were expelled. Manuel
Suarez Benavides, a Honduran armed forces spokesman, said the five
dissident military commanders left Thursday on a flight to Miami.
   ``We don't want the Contras to settle their problems in
Honduras,'' Suarez Benavides said. ``The Contras must resolve their
internal affairs outside of our national territory.''
   The U.S.-backed Contras are waging a guerrilla war to overthrow
the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, a
Contra umbrella group, arrived in the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa on Thursday but refused to comment on the whereabouts
of the five.
   One of the five is Enrique Sanchez, brother of Contra director
Aristides Sanchez, according to Mrs. Lacayo. Enrique Sanchez, like
Lacayo, was a civilian aide to the Contra military forces.
   The other detainees were Walter Calderon Lopez, known as
Commander Tono; Tirzo Ramon Moreno, known as Commander Rigoberto;
Alejandro Montealegre and a rebel pilot identified only as Waikita.
   Adolfo Calero, one of the five directors of the Resistance,
reportedly agreed with the dissidents that Bermudez should be
removed, in part because he has opposed parts of the peace
agreement with the Sandinista goverment.
   Calero unsuccessfully tried to persuade the other four directors
to remove Bermudez, but the leaders deadlocked.
   Mrs. Lacayo said a Contra military doctor ran into a top aide to
Bermudez at the airport at the same hour that Mrs. Lacayo's husband
and the others were being arrested. The aide said the men were to
be expelled immediately.
   One commander, Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, also known as
Fernando, escaped detention when the others were arrested and is in
hiding, Mrs. Lacayo said.
   Until January, Fernando was the personnel assistant to Bermudez,
a former colonel in Somoza's hated National Guard.

   The oceanfront mansion where Claus von
Bulow allegedly tried to kill his heiress wife, Sunny, is up for
sale, a local real estate agent said.
   No price has been set for Clarendon Court, the 8.3-acre estate
on Newport's ``millionaires' row,'' Jacqueline Throop, manager of
real estate for Gustave J.S. White Real Estate Co., said Thursday.
She did not say whether there were any potential buyers.
   The estate, one of the last privately owned estates on Aquidneck
Island, includes a three-story stone main house, an 18-room
carriage house, three fountains, a swimming pool and a 1.3-acre
undeveloped lot sloping down toward Rhode Island Sound.
   According to tax assessors' records, the estate was assessed at
$1.4 million on Dec. 31, 1986. Tax assessor Allan Booth estimated
the current market value would be about double the assessed value.
   The estate is owned by Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow, who purchased
it in 1970 for a reported $250,000 and spent another $600,000 to
renovate the mansion.
   Mrs. von Bulow has been in a coma since 1980. Her husband, Claus
von Bulow, was acquitted in 1985 of charges that he induced the
coma while trying to murder his wife with an insulin injection.
   Von Bulow agreed late last year to renounce all claims to his
wife's fortune, including the estate and the New York cooperataive
apartment where he had been living, in order to settle a lawsuit
filed against him by his stepchildren. He has announced plans to
move to Europe.

<HEAD>Kids Tend To Be Better Nourished If They Eat Breakfast Cereal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ready-to-eat cold cereals provide lots of
nutrients, and children who eat them tend to be better nourished
than those who breakfast on other foods, according to a study of
hundreds of 1- to 5-year-olds.
   University of Missouri nutritionist Gretchen Hill said her study
shows ``kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the
cereal box and some milk.''
   Hill, who presented her study Thursday during the annual meeting
of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,
said the research didn't suggest that cold cereal was the only good
breakfast.
   Parents who feed their children well-balanced breakfasts _
fruit, toast, low-fat milk, some bacon and only three eggs weekly _
shouldn't change, she said.
   ``But if you're lazy and have to choose between doughnuts and
cereal, provide the cereal,'' especially with low-fat milk, she
said. ``The data was very clear that there are a lot of nutrients
in that breakfast they might not get enough of in some other
breakfast.''
   Even a leading critic of sugar in breakfast cereals agreed with
the study's conclusion.
   ``Cold cereal is a good breakfast. But giving your child a
fortified cereal is like giving them a vitamin pill,'' said Bonnie
Liebman, nutrition director for the Washington-based Center for
Science in the Public Interest.
   While most cereals are fortified, ``parents should still try to
choose the most healthful breakfast cereals _ those relatively low
in sugar and those that are whole grain,'' Liebman said.
   Hill used data collected in l985 by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for her study of 27 dietary components _ including
calories, protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber _ consumed during
all three meals and snacks by 548 children ages 1 to 5 nationwide.
   Eleven skipped breakfast. Of the others, about half ate
ready-to-eat cereals. The half that didn't eat cereals wasn't
divided as to whether the children ate balanced breakfasts or not
because Hill simply wanted to know how the average cereal eater did
compared with other children.
   Cereal eaters tended to receive significantly more vitamins A
and B12, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, iron, folic acid
and zinc than non-cereal eaters or breakfast skippers, Hill said.
Cereal eaters also ate significantly less cholesterol and fat.
   She said all three groups tended to get adequate protein and
carbohydrate, but breakfast skippers risked low-energy and future
bone ailments because they failed to meet recommended daily amounts
of thiamine, calcium and vitamin A, and ate less fiber, pyridoxine,
calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper.
   Hill's study was financed by the Missouri Agricultural
Experiment Station, without support from cereal manufacturers, she
said.
   Liebman cautioned that a link between breakfast cereals and
better overall nutrition ``doesn't prove cause and effect. It's
possible these kids overall ate less fat and cholesterol because
they came from families that are more nutrition-conscious.''

   Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent dissident,
will be allowed to make his first trip to the United States to
attend a scholarly conference in December, a pro-Beijing newspaper
reported today.
   Fang was notified Thursday that officials approved his taking
part in an international symposium on the theory of relativity to
be held in Texas, the Chinese-language Wen Wei Po reported. The
dissident is a renowned astrophysicist who works at the Beijing
Observatory.
   The notice came a day after Fang made an electrifying public
appearance at Beijing University during which he advocated greater
democracy. He spoke to several hundred students at an informal
gathering.
   The scientist, an outspoken critic of China's socialist system,
said Wednesday that ``I never change my opinion'' on China's
politics or economy.
   Fang was forced to resign in early 1987 as vice president of the
Science and Technology University in Hefei, Anhui province.
Authorities claimed he incited pro-democracy student protests that
swept the country.
   Fang has been denied repeated requests to conduct research in
the United States. He has said he received invitations from several
American universities, including Harvard.
   The three-sentence dispatch in Wen Wei Po gave no other details
about Fang's possible U.S. trip. It said he would travel to
Australia in August.

   Communist rebels killed a deputy
police commander and a retired sergeant today, police said. More
than 20 people have died in guerrilla clashes in the past three
days.
   Police said two assailants shot and killed retired police Sgt.
Feliciano Belandrez and Capt. Teofilo Tan, a deputy station
commander, in attacks three hours apart in Manila.
   Police said Belandrez was killed as he was leaving his home. Tan
had just returned from the night shift and was seated in front of
his house when two assailants approached.
   ``One guy even greeted him (Tan). He shouted `Captain!.' When
the captain replied, the man pulled out a .45 (caliber pistol) from
his waist and shot him twice in the head,'' said police Cpl. Johnny
Aguirre. ``The two walked casually after shooting him.''
   Police said they believed the assailants were members of the
communist New People's Army, which has been fighting the government
since March 1969.
   The guerrillas have killed more than 100 police and soldiers in
the capital since early 1987, police said.
   Military officials said nine soldiers were killed and eight
wounded Wednesday and Thursday after a military patrol stumbled on
a guerrilla training camp and fought about 400 rebels in the
mountain village of Umas in Negros Island, 350 miles southeast of
Manila.
   No rebel casualty figures were immediately available.
   Military reports said two other soldiers, eight rebels and a
military informant were also killed in clashes Wednesday on the
main island of Luzon, on the central Samar island and on Mindanao
in the south.
   The deputy chief of staff for intelligence told a civic group
that 1,291 people were killed in more than 1,200 ``insurgency
related'' incidents throughout the country this year.
   Brig. Gen. Galileo Kintanar said the dead included 584 rebels,
346 soldiers and 361 civilians.

   Three more bodies were found around
an island cave where French soldiers rescued 23 hostages held by
Melanesian separatists in this French Pacific territory, officials
said today.
   The presumed chief of the captors, Alphonse Dianou, died of
wounds inflicted during Thursday's assault, the gendarmerie said.
His death and the discovery of the bodies of the three Melanesians
brought the death toll to 21.
   France's minister for overseas territories, Bernard Pons, said
the 7,000 army and gendarmerie personnel in New Caledonia were on a
state of ``absolute alert'' following the bloody rescue mission
that freed 22 gendarmes, police under military orders, and one
assistant prosecutor.
   The situation appeared calm today, but the Kanak Socialist
National Liberation Front, the main separatist group, called for a
24-hour mobilization Saturday to protest the attack on Ouvea, an
island in the Loyalty group northeast of Noumea, the capital.
   A front statement promised strikes in a ``day of active mourning
of the same level as the massacre on Ouvea.''
   Fifteen 15 separatists and two members of the assault team were
initially reported killed in the assault. Five other people were
injured.
   The front statement said the death toll showed the attack was
``premeditated butchery.''
   Pons, announcing the state of alert, said ``terrorists ... will
find themselves in front of entirely determined men.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Both Pons and conservative Premier Jacques Chirac have referred
to the front as a ``terrorist group.'' Pons has asked that the
front be outlawed, a position supported by Chirac. However,
President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, who would have to
approve such a decree, has expressed his disapproval.
   Chirac and Mitterrand are vying for the presidency in elections
on Sunday.
   Sources in the front's political bureau said that disrupting the
elections was not a question.
   The hostage-taking on Ouvea was in part to protest regional
elections held here April 24, the same day as first-round
presidential voting. The front boycotted the regional balloting.
   The front is seeking independence from France, which has ruled
New Caledonia since 1853.

   A purification system failed at a gas refinery in
the Ural Mountains and released a cloud of hydrogen sulphide that
poisoned 52 people and contaminated a village beyond remedy, a
newspaper reported.
   Nine of the injured required hospitalization, the Sovietskaya
Rossiya daily said in its report Thursday.
   The leak occurred in Muzhichya Pavlovka, near Orenburg, and the
paper said the village's 844 residents would have to be resettled.
   The problem began with the failure in early March of a gas
purification unit, the article said. Then, on April 25, the duty
engineer noticed a compressor malfunction.
   ``The only right decision in that case was to stop pumping gas
to the refinery,'' the newspaper said. ``The refinery released gas
to burn instead, which, according to the local population, has been
the regular practice here.''
   K.I. Akulov, the Soviet health official, told the newspaper the
refinery near Orenburg and another in Astrakhan on the Caspian Sea
are dangerous to the public health and urged that corrective
measures be taken.
   ``Still, today, none of the sulfur purification systems are
operating at either refinery, nor do automatic control systems to
detect poisonous releases exist. The three-mile protective belt,
ordered in 1975, never was maintained around the refinery.''
   To make matters worse, the newspaper said, the ministry
responsible for relocating the villagers does not plan to do it
until 1990 or 1991.

   William Stanley Hayter, an English-born painter
sought by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali for his
innovative printmaking techniques, died of cardiac arrest at age
86, it was reported today.
   Hayter, who died Wednesday in Paris, was a leading figure in the
Paris art scene for more than half a century.
   The Paris-based International Herald Tribune said in today's
editions that Hayter was credited with turning engraving into a
lively and experimental form that brought many famous artists to
work alongside him in his studio in Montparnasse.
   Among those artists who visited him at his studio, known as
Atelier 17, were Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jackson Pollock,
Dali and Picasso.
   Hayter was born in London in 1901 and graduated from Kings
College, London, with honor degrees in art and chemistry. He worked
in Iran from 1922 to 1925 for the Anglo-Iranian oil company but his
first interest was art.
   ``My father was a painter and a lot of people in my family
before, so I was messing about with painting fairly seriously when
I was a child. I was painting all the time when I was in the
(Middle) East,'' Hayter once said. ``I didn't do much with prints
till I came to Paris.''
   He quickly discovered and revolutionized the vanishing art of
original printmaking, bringing new techniques to the medium
including a method of color printing from a single plate instead of
having a separate plate for each tone.
   Hayter wrote two books that are essential reading for
printmakers, ``New Ways of Gravure'' (1949) and ``About Prints''
(1962).
   He lived in Paris from 1926 to 1939, then went to New York,
where he established his studio at the New School and gave an
impetus to American printmaking. He returned to Paris in 1950.

   Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, who helped
transform Pittsburgh from a sickly steel town to a vital corporate
center, died early Friday of a rare heart disease after more than a
decade in office. He was 56.
   The mayor died of cardiac amyloidosis, according to the
Allegheny County Coroner's Office and a hospital spokesman. The
incurable disease deposits dangerous amounts of protein in the
heart and other major organs.
   As City Council president in 1977, he took over as interim mayor
when then-Mayor Pete Flaherty joined the Carter adminstration, then
ran as an independent and narrowly beat the popular Democratic
candidate for the office.
   Caliguiri was sworn in April 10, 1977, as the 53rd mayor of
Pittsburgh. He won re-election twice by landslides during a period
in which the region lost more than 75,000 jobs and had unemployment
rates as high as 19 percent.

<TEXT>
   Radio Moscow reported today that work had resumed
at the steel mill in southern Poland where state-run media had
reported that police broke up a strike.
   On Thursday, a government spokesman said the Kremlin regrets the
labor unrest confronting its ally.
   Later Thursday, the official Tass news agency reported that
plainclothes Polish agents entered the Lenin steelworks in the
Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta before dawn ``to restore order, to
enable the majority of the labor collectives to resume work and to
prevent further damage to the national economy.''
   It said the strike was broken up without ``incidents,'' and that
strike committee members were detained. The agency did not mention
the lockout at the Lenin shipyard in Poland's Baltic port of Gdansk.
   Today's editions of the Communist Party daily Pravda carried the
Tass report on page seven.
   Radio Moscow, without mentioning the situation in Gdansk or Nowa
Huta, reported at noon Thursday that 61 percent of the people
surveyed in Poland thought a strike wave that broke out there April
25 would damage the economy.
   At a regular news briefing Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov was asked about the unrest and said: ``We
regret that such events take place in Poland.''
   He declined to say whether Soviet officials had offered advice
or suggestions to the Polish government about the situation.
   Polish workers are seeking pay increases of up to 60 percent to
offset prices that have gone up 42 percent so far this year.
   The strikers in Gdansk and Nowa Huta also demand reinstatement
of free trade unions and fired union activists and the release of
political prisoners.
   Poland's communist authorities have said the price increases are
necessary to straighten out Poland's economic problems and the
strikes damage the reform effort.
   Pravda on Wednesday accused ``anti-Polish centers'' in the West
and domestic dissidents of trying to exploit the unrest in Poland.
   Before Polish authorities stifled the Solidarity free trade
union movement with the December 1981 imposition of martial law,
Soviet troops had massed on Poland's border and there was
speculation they might intervene.

<HEAD>India Needed Heavy Water At Time Norwegian Consignment Vanished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India needed heavy water in 1983 when 15
tons of the nuclear coolant vanished while being shipped from
Norway to West Germany, government records show.
   An official with access to the records said today he did not
know how India coped with the shortage. Another official at the
Ministry of Science and Technology flatly denied that the missing
Norwegian heavy water came to India.
   Both spoke on condition they not be further identified.
   The Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang reported April 21 that 15 tons
of heavy water was flown on a Liberian-registered West African
airlines plane via Basel, Switzerland, to Dubai.
   The paper said it then probably went to a nuclear reactor in
Bombay.
   The records show that five years ago, India needed to import
heavy water to augment its own stock so it could commission a
235-megawatt, uranium-fueled reactor at Kalpakkam, 50 miles south
of Madras in southern Tamil Nadu state.
   The commissioning of the plant was to take place in 1982, but it
was delayed for lack of heavy water, the official said.
   The plant finally went into operation on Jan. 27, 1984, several
months after the Norwegian consignment went astray.
   The government official could not say where India got heavy
water for the Kalpakkam plant.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, looks like ordinary water but
has an extra neutron and cools a nuclear reactor by moderating the
speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction.
   It enables the reactor to run on natural uranium instead of
enriched uranium fuel and to produce plutonium, which can be used
for nuclear weapons.
   India's nuclear power program has been based on natural uranium
and heavy water.
   The official at the Ministry of Science and Technology said that
when India needs extra heavy water, it is imported from the Soviet
Union.
   Norway refuses to sell heavy water to India because it has not
signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   India has refused to sign the agreement, because it believes it
discriminates against developing countries by preserving nuclear
capabilities for a few developed nations.
   India has six heavy water plants.

   The confrontation in the Great Belt Strait off Denmark came four

country's ban on peacetime nuclear weapons. Government leaders have
called the vote a referendum on continued membership in NATO.
   The environmentists put the radiation sign on the hull of a ship
believed to be of the Krivak class, which has nuclear capability.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen criticized their
protest as a disruption of legitimate international traffic.
   ``It was not very polite to our Soviet friends,'' he said.
``They are within their full right to pass through international
waters with nuclear arms.''

   Rival Palestinian factions battled with
mortars, rockets and machine guns in west Beirut's devastated
Chatilla refugee camp today. Police said six people were killed and
30 wounded.
   In a separate attack, four Shiite militiamen of Justice Minister
Nabih Berri's Syrian-backed Amal movement were killed in Beirut's
southern slums by unidentified gunmen in a speeding car. Amal
blamed a rival Shiite faction.
   Two other people died and five were wounded when a bomb exploded
Thursday night in a movie theater in Beirut's Syrian-policed Moslem
sector, police reported.
   It was the third cinema bombing in west Beirut in two weeks. Two
people were wounded in the earlier blasts.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
fundamentalist Moslem factions were believed to be behind the
bombings to force amusement centers to close during the Moslem
fasting month of Ramadan.
   The fighting in Chatilla between guerrillas of Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction and a
rival Syrian-backed group known as Fatah-Uprising began shortly
after dusk Thursday and still was raging today.
   Each side pounded the other's positions with 82-mm mortars,
106-mm recoilless cannon, heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled
grenades, police said.
   It was not known what touched off the fighting, the second
outbreak of violence in Chatilla this week.
   At least eight fighters were killed and 43 wounded Monday in the
first major clash between the two factions since Arafat's
reconciliation meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus two weeks ago.
   Fatah, the main group within the PLO, overran most of the rival
faction's positions in Chatilla in that clash and seized control of
the camp.
   In the south Beirut violence, Amal accused the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, of killing the four militiamen.
   Police said Amal militiamen besieged the main Hezbollah barracks
in Beirut shortly after the shooting, but there were no immediate
reports of any more violence.
   Amal crushed Hezbollah in Shiite-dominated south Lebanon in
April. Sixty-two people were killed and 150 wounded in four days of
fighting.
   That was a major setback for the fundamentalist Hezbollah's aim
of setting up an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiite
factions holding 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon.

   A U.S.-Laotian team has expanded its
search on a remote Laotian hillside for the remains of two American
fliers shot down in 1966, U.S. officials said today.
   The 14-man U.S. military team is cooperating with Laotian
government officials in the third joint excavation of a U.S.
warplane crash site. The searchers are trying to account for 555
Americans who didn't return home from Laos during the Indochina war.
   The team flew to Laos Tuesday to search the brush- and
bamboo-covered area of southern Savannakhet province, where an
OV-1A Mohawk was downed by heavy ground fire on March 15, 1966.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said it received an undated message
from the team saying the search site had been expanded from 4-by-11
yards to 40-by-60 yards.
   ``No explanation was given, but it is assumed that the team
discovered material from the plane ... outside the presumed
original 4-by-11-yard primary impact area,'' the statement said.
   ``The joint U.S.-Laotian team has removed brush from the lower
half of the search area and has begun to examine it for material
and remains from the plane,'' it said.
   The excavation is expected to be completed early next week.
   The American team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory,
Honolulu-based agencies entrusted with resolving the fates of
Americans missing in foreign wars. It is led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey.
   Maj. Tim Pfister, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, said
the Mohawk was involved in a mission to block the western portion
of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnam used to infiltrate
men into U.S.-backed South Vietnam.

<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent epidemic of deformed birds and
a decline in the populations of certain bird types is a warning the
Earth may still be on the path to ecological disaster, a leading
ecologist warned.
   ``There may yet be a `Silent Spring' in our future,'' Stanford
University ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich told a gathering Thursday at
the Peninsula Conservation Center in Palo Alto, about 30 miles
south of San Francisco.
   Ehrlich, co-author of ``The Birder's Handbook,'' a natural
history of North American birds, referred to Rachel Carson's
prediction of environmental deterioration in her 1962 book ``Silent
Spring.''
   The book, said to have galvanized the U.S. environmental
movement, warned that if pesticide spraying was not controlled
entire ecological system could be thrown out of balance.
   ``Because pesticide use is now better regulated, some of the
danger has passed,'' said Ehrlich, ``but like the miners' canaries
of old, birds still serve as an environmental early warning
system.''
   The clearing of U.S. forests has led to a decline in warblers
and other songbirds, and toxics found in agricultural runoff are
creating mutations among other bird species, Ehrlich said.
   ``Birds are quite sensitive to poisons in the environment, and
as a result an epidemic of deformed birds has recently hit the
United States,'' said Ehrlich.
   ``It appears to be connected with high concentrations of
selenium, mercury and other toxic elements in agricultural runoff
and drainage from mines and power plants,'' he said.
   Duck and loon populations have declined in areas where acid rain
has destroyed the aquatic insects, fish and other prey in lakes and
marshes where birds breed, he said.

<HEAD>Fired Mayoral Aide Says Others Plotted Against Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer says he'll call a conference
of community and religious leaders to ``heal our wounds'' after a
five-day controversy that led to an aide's firing because of
racist, anti-Semitic remarks.
   Sawyer dismissed Steve Cokely on Thursday under mounting
pressure from the City Council and community groups. The mayor said
he acted after consulting with a ``broadly-based, multiracial
group.''
   ``As mayor, I will not tolerate any racial divisiveness from any
employee,'' Sawyer said. ``I'm sensitive, and I heard from a lot of
people, and I took time to work through the process.''
   At issue in the controversy were statements Cokely made in a
series of lectures from 1985 through 1987. They were tape-recorded
and made available for sale at a store run by followers of Nation
of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   Cokely, the mayor's special projects coordinator, said in the
lectures that doctors, ``especially Jewish ones,'' were infecting
blacks with AIDS and other diseases. Cokely, like Sawyer, is black.
   He also called Christopher Columbus a ``Hispanic Jew'' who
brought slaves to America and said Columbus Day was a ``white
supremacist holiday.'' Cokely also labeled the Christian cross a
``symbol of white supremacy.''
   The 35-year-old aide, whose remarks were made public in weekend
newspaper reports, apologized Monday, and Sawyer said then he had a
talk with the aide to ``rehabilitate Steve.''
   However, the mayor, who had been told by Jewish leaders weeks
ago about Cokely's remarks, came under fire for his delay in taking
action.
   ``It was my thought that Steve Cokely should have been
terminated immediately,'' said Alderman Timothy Evans, one of the
mayor's political opponents. ``It was not done ... and it was a
mistake.''
   At a rally Thursday night after his firing, Cokely told about
150 cheering supporters that he was dismissed from the
$35,000-a-year job because he was getting too powerful.
   ``There was a plot to force me to resign,'' Cokely said.
   Mayoral aide Monroe Anderson described Cokely as ``a gofer'' who
``goes to groups in the black community, listens, sometimes talks
and then reports to the mayor about the concerns of those groups.''

<TEXT>
   Researchers who put swimsuit-clad women
in drafty rooms and dunked them in cool water say women who often
complain of the cold may be consuming too little iron.
   ``If you are cold a lot of the time or cold when other people
aren't, then you might have a physician check your blood iron
levels,'' said Pennsylvania State University nutritionist John L.
Beard.
   Physiologist Henry Lukaski, who conducted another study linking
iron deficiency to feelings of chilliness among women, said women
should ask their doctors to test blood levels of an iron-carrying
protein called ferritin, a more accurate indicator of mild iron
deficiency than measurement of hemoglobin, the iron-containing
protein that makes blood red.
   Beard and Lukaski, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Human
Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D., presented their
studies Thursday at the annual meeting of the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   Lukaski said men also can feel cold due to iron deficiency, but
far fewer do so than women. Men tend to get more iron because they
eat more, while women lose iron through menstruation, he said.
   He said women who suffer mild iron deficiency should eat more
lean red meat and other high-iron foods, including fish, poultry,
beans, beets and leafy green vegetables, and should drink orange
juice to enhance iron uptake.
   Iron-rich foods are preferable to iron supplements because
organic iron is more readily absorbed by the body than inorganic
iron supplements, Lukaski said. However, Beard said, iron
supplements are practical and adequate if taken over a long time.
   Beard's study compared eight women who were very iron-deficient
with 10 women who had normal iron levels. Both groups had equal
percentages of body fat, and the experiment was designed to
eliminate bias caused by differences in diet and menstrual cycle.
The women were submerged up to their necks for 100 minutes in
82-degree water, 16.6 degrees below normal body temperature.
   Beard found the iron-deficient women's body temperatures dropped
an average of 1.25 degrees Fahrenheit compared with a drop of
three-fourths of a degree in the normal women.
   Thyroid hormone, which increases body metabolism to produce
heat, didn't increase as much in the iron-deficient women as in the
others. Iron-deficient women also used 13 percent less oxygen,
indicating they generated less body heat.
   But after the anemic women took iron tablets for 12 weeks to
reverse their condition, all the differences vanished.
   Lukaski and USDA scientist Clint Hall had six women wear
two-piece bathing suits and sit in a room with a cool draft on two
occasions.
   The first time, after eating an low-iron diet for 80 days, the
women started to shiver after an average of 84 minutes.
   Then the women ate a diet with almost the recommended daily
amount of iron for 84 days, followed by iron supplements for 16
days. The women shivered after an average of 92 minutes.
   Lukaski also found that when the women were iron-deficient,
their body temperatures fell about 1.1 degrees, compared with
one-half a degree after they ate the diet with more iron.
   In addition, the women produced more thyroid hormone and two to
three times more norepineprine when they had adequate iron.
Norepinephrine is a stress hormone that tells the body to produce
heat, Lukaski said.
   He said previous studies found about 30 percent of American
women don't get enough iron. The recommended daily amount is 18
milligrams for women who menstruate, and 15 milligrams for men and
for older women.

<HEAD>CIA Chief Questions Indictments of Foreign Leaders</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 4-5, Meanwhile the Wall, with Reagan ordering
CIA to use clandestine means against Noriega.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster says he questions
the wisdom of indicting foreign leaders such as military strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama on drug charges, according to an
interview published today.
   ``There has to be some advance thinking about where these
actions take us and whether they do in fact help the drug
enforcement counter-narcotics program or create some confusion,''
the former FBI chief and federal judge told The Washington Times.
   ``What do we intend to do with these indictments?'' he asked.
``Do we intend to pursue extradition? Are we going to seek to
overthrow by whatever means we have _ economic, military, political
_ as a result of the indictment?''
   Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported today that President
Reagan has ordered the CIA to begin using clandestine radio
broadcasts, leaflets and rumormongering against Noriega.
   The CIA agreed to undertake the propaganda campaign after the
agency rejected State Department propopals for financial or
paramilitary aid to anti-Noriega forces, the newspaper said. Even
before the new program gets going, it said, its launching is being
complicated by the Pentagon's refusal to let the CIA use U.S.
military bases to broadcast anti-Noriega messages.
   Noriega faces federal drug charges in Florida, but negotiations
aimed at getting him to step down include arrangements not to seek
his extradition.
   Still, Webster said he has confidence that Noriega ``can be
persuaded _ if that's the nice word for it _ induced to step down
if the current pressures are not significantly relaxed and other
pressures are considered.''
   When asked if U.S. policy had failed in Panama, he said: ``I
don't think it's lost. The only thing that's going to get lost is
maybe some `face' of those who made wild predictions that he would
roll over and play dead the first time we barked at him.''

<TEXT>
   The new leader of northern Georgia's Roman
Catholics promised them his status as the nation's first black
archbishop would not hamper his relationship with his mostly white
parishioners.
   ``There can be no escaping the fact that I am the first black
bishop to serve in Atlanta and the first black archbishop in the
nation,'' Archbishop Eugene A. Marino told the thousands of people
attending his installation Mass Thursday.
   ``Having noted that, I hasten my deep personal conviction that
it need not affect the quality of my ministry among you nor the
nature of our relationship with each other,'' he said, prompting
prolonged applause.
   The Archdiocese of Atlanta covers 69 counties in north Georgia,
with a Catholic population of about 156,000, including about 10,000
blacks. Only two of the approximately 200 priests in the
archdiocese are black; about five of the 65 parishes are
predominantly black.
   Many of the nation's highest ranking Roman Catholic leaders
attended Thursday's Mass, including Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of
Chicago, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and retired Cardinal John
Krol of Philadelphia.
   In addition, more than 800 clergy, including nearly 100 Roman
Catholic bishops, were present, prompting Archbishop Pio Laghi,
Pope John Paul II's representative in the United States, to say the
support showed ``that the selection made by the Holy Father has
been the right one.''
   The overflow crowd at the Atlanta Civic Center warmly received
Marino, a native of Biloxi, Miss., applauding as he entered the
hall and interrupting his homily several times with more applause.
   ``I come to you today with neither pretense nor apology,''
Marino said.
   ``Like so many of you, I am a Southerner. My roots go deep into
the rich, brown soil of Mississippi and back to Puerto Rico and
Africa. I was born and raised in the Deep South, the old South with
its curious mixture of aristocratic gentility and gracious
hospitality on the one hand and racial segregation on the other,''
Marino said.
   ``Although at times embarrassed, today I am unashamed from
whence I have come. The experience of the old South has profoundly
influenced all of us, black and white. Suffering through that
experience has laid the foundation of the New South so beautifully
and dramatically typified by this city. Today I happy to be a
citizen of Atlanta.''
   Among the local leaders attending the Mass were Coretta Scott
King and Martin Luther King III along with other relatives of the
late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; and Mayor Andrew Young, himself a
Congregationalist minister.

   A polio-stricken executive at a burning
rocket fuel plant chose to stay behind and call the fire department
rather than flee, and that cost his life and the life of another
man who apparently tried to help, plant officials say.
   Shortly after Leroy Westerfield made his call, an
earthquake-force explosion obliterated the Pacific Engineering
Production Co. building and 11 others in the industrial complex,
killing two and injuring more than 255 people.
   Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, a friend of Westerfield, apparently
died while he tried to coax the crippled man from the inferno,
co-workers say. Westerfield, 62, had been partially paralyzed by
polio since he was 19.
   ``If he was there, he'll stay around until everyone gets out,''
said Halker's wife, Roma, as she awaited word of his fate. ``That
plant was his whole life.''
   The body of Halker, vice president for operations, was found
several hours after the initial blast and several that followed.
Authorities spent Thursday scouring the charred rubble of the plant
hoping to find a trace of the popular Westerfield, the company's
controller for 28 years.
   ``We lost two of our very closest friends,'' said Fred Gibson,
the plant chairman.
   Production of a key fuel component for the space shuttle and
U.S. military rockets was halted until manufacturers ascertain the
equipment malfunction that caused the fire and explosions, which
left widespread property damage throughout the Las Vegas Valley.
   Union officials said Thursday they had complained about safety
at Pacific Engineering, but plant officials denied a bad safety
record.
   ``This plant is, in my opinion, one of the worst I have ever
been into,'' John Molovich, safety and heath technician with the
international Steelworkers Union, said in a letter following a
September 1982 tour of the plant. The letter was released Thursday.
   ``I cannot understand how this plant has not been blown off the
face of the earth, given the product it manufactures,'' Molovich
wrote.
   ``We've had people burned, we've had people blown up _ minor
explosions that severely injured workers,'' said Jim Thompson,
president of Steelworkers Union Local 4856.
   Gibson responded: ``It is a safe plant and I am stating there
have been no fires there. We had inspections from OSHA and we had
no continuing problems with anything.''
   Laury Lewis, general manager of the State Industrial Insurance
System, said his records indicate Pacific Engineering ``has always
been a pretty good risk.'' His records, he said, indicated no
previous multiple injury problems or explosions.
   Plant employees, many of them wearing bandages, gathered in the
community center in this town of 55,000 on Thursday to discuss the
disaster and observe a moment of silence for Westerfield and Halker.
   Tears welling in his eyes, Westerfield's son, Gary, said he was
not surprised his father risked death to save his co-workers.
``That was his style,'' the son said.
   ``His polio got so bad he could barely get around,'' said plant
foreman Robert Thayer, a friend of nearly three decades. ``It
didn't affect his mind one bit.''
   Keith Rucker, the company's general counsel, said people at the
plant tried to get Westerfield to leave when a fire spread out of
control in the plant's drying room.
   ``It's my understanding ... he said `no' because he had to call
the fire department,'' Rucker said. Gary Westerfield listened to a
tape of the call to fire officials. ``That was my father's voice,''
he said.
   Pacific Engineering is one of two plants in the United States
that makes ammonium perchlorate, a fuel oxidizer for the space
shuttle's solid rocket boosters and the military's MX, Minuteman
and Titan missiles. The other is Kerr-McGee, whose plant is just a
mile away from the site of Wednesday's destruction.
   The explosions, the most powerful of which was registered at 3.5
on the Richter scale of ground motion, twisted steel girders like
pretzels and turned some of the 40 cars parked nearby into chunks
of melted metal.
   Concussions from the blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in
Las Vegas, jolted airliners in flight, peeled off roofs, upended
cars and threw workers through walls. Broken windows and cracked
foundations were common in Henderson.
   Area schools closed for a week so inspectors could determine if
buildings were safe. Damage estimates were still uncertain Thursday.
   U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., toured the site after asking
President Reagan in a letter to declare Henderson a federal
emergency disaster area, a move that would open the door to
low-interest loans to enable residents to repair damage.

   The socialist Labor Party made strong gains in
local balloting and overtook Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives in the first electoral test of her third-term
program, returns indicated today.
   The election Thursday was fought on the national issues of a
Thatcher-inspired shakeup of the welfare system this spring and
plans for a new property tax. Property taxes, together with central
government grants, fund local governments.
   ``The results are a major rebuff to the government's policies.
The country has said, enough is enough,'' said Labor Party general
secretary Larry Whitty after the day-long balloting Thursday.
   The Labor Party kept major prizes including Birmingham,
Britain's second-largest city, and the Scottish capital, Edinburgh.
It also took control of the university city of Cambridge.
   With results declared from 207 of the 211 local governments
contested in the day-long ballot, Labor had net gains of 107 seats.
The Conservatives had lost three and the centrists lost 74, the
British domestic news agency Press Association calculated.
   The Conservatives had control of 48 of the contested cities and
towns, up seven; Labor had 97, up six; and the centrist Social
Democratic and Liberal Party had six, unchanged.
   The rest were controlled by independents, Scottish natonalists
or had no party with overall control.
   Despite the apparent edge to Labor, the Conservatives posted
gains in the prosperous south and captured seven city councils no
one party had controlled previously.
   The big loser was the third-place Social and Liberal Democratic
Party. It was formed in March to merge the centrists, but a
breakaway faction remains a separate party.
   Critics charge that Mrs. Thatcher is going too far with
right-wing policies and the latest moves on welfare and taxes are
unfair to the poor.
   A British Broadcasting Corp. computer analysis showed that Labor
took 39 percent of the vote, a nine-point jump since the June
general election, while the Conservatives had 37 percent, five
points down, and the centrists with 18 percent suffered a
four-point drop.
   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley said that, considering the
controversy over the welfare and property tax changes, the Tories
did ``rather well.''
   David Steel, Social and Liberal Democratic Party co-leader,
said: ``I'm not pretending we've done well. But it has been an
awfully difficult year for us.''
   The election, in which about 20 million Britons were eligible to
vote, involved about 4,000 seats that were last contested in 1984.
   One-third of seats on the local authorities in England and Wales
and the entire councils in the 53 Scottish districts were at stake.
There were no elections this year in London and Northern Ireland.
   The Conservatives, humiliated in Scotland in the June general
election, again failed to make headway there. They remained in
control of just a handful of small councils in Scotland, while
Labor added the major city of Aberdeen to its collection of
Scottish victories.
   The welfare changes are part of an ambitious program by Mrs.
Thatcher to end what the Conservatives term Britain's ``dependency
culture'' nutured by the welfare state.
   Under the new property tax, now having a rough ride through
Parliament, taxes would be levied on each individual adult in a
household.
   Under the old system, the tax was levied only on each individual
property, regardless of how many people lived there. The new
flat-rate system, dubbed a poll tax by critics, will treble the
bill for some households.
   Mrs. Thatcher believes that making everyone pay will bring home
the cost of electing left-wing local authorities, the big spenders.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha's
daughter was quoted as saying in an interview that blacks ``just
want our houses and swimming pools, but I can't blame them.''
   Rozanne Botha, in a recent interview with the University of Cape
Town newspaper Ascent, also was quoted as saying that ``colored
(mixed-race) people have an identity crisis.''
   Miss Botha, 27, in an interview published today with The Star of
Johannesburg, was quoted as saying her earlier comments in Ascent
were likely to ``cause trouble.''
   She was quoted as saying in The Star that her quotes in Ascent
were accurate, but that they were ``totally drawn out of
proportion.''
   In the interview with Ascent, Miss Botha was quoted as saying
that she had led a privileged life as a white South African, but
noted that she had spent a difficult year in the army.
   ``It's not as if I don't know about suffering,'' she was quoted
as saying. ``I slept on the floor in the army and had cold showers.
The blacks just want our houses and swimming pools, but I can't
blame them.''
   Miss Botha was involved in controversy several months ago when
she appeared in the documentary ``Children of Apartheid,'' by the
American CBS television network.
   The program, which featured interviews with young black and
white South Africans, aired in the United States in December.
   While black youths criticized the government and its apartheid
policies, Miss Botha defended her father and his government's
version of measured racial reform.
   The South African government described the documentary as
``blatant distortion'' which emphasized only the ``negative
aspects'' of South Africa.

<TEXT>
   Ailing opera impresario Rudolf Bing was abused
and prevented from getting proper care by his wife, according to
witnesses at a hearing to determine whether she should be thrown
out of his home.
   Bing's lawyer has asked a judge to annul the Bings' January 1987
marriage, claiming the 86-year-old former Metropolitan Opera
leader, who has Alzheimer's disease, didn't know what he was doing
when he married her.
   But first, at Thursday's hearing, the lawyer, Paul Goldhamer,
asked judge Carmen Ciparick to remove 48-year-old Carroll Bing from
the couple's apartment because she is a danger to her husband.
   Mrs. Bing frequently disrupted the hearing by trying to take
Bing from the courtroom and yelling that witnesses were lying. A
court in Washington has declared her mentally incompetent to handle
her affairs.
   A restaurant captain, Enrico Caruso, said Mrs. Bing once threw a
glass of water at Bing because he wanted to dine with longtime
friend Margaret Gilbert.
   Annette Maggio, guest relations manager at the Essex House, said
she saw Mrs. Bing shake her husband roughly by his shoulders when
his court-appointed conservator, Paul Guth, tried to speak to him.
   ``Don't you know they're trying to separate us?'' Ms. Maggio
quoted Mrs. Bing as screaming.
   Bing's night nurse, Alice Brennan, said the elderly man has had
only two baths in the past two months, because Mrs. Bing did not
allow nurses near him.
   ``Carroll was constantly saying that we (the nurses) were trying
to take her man,'' Mrs. Brennan said.

   A Brownie troop's hopes of shipping
more than 400 boxes of Girl Scout cookies to sailors aboard a U.S.
aircraft carrier are crumbling after Japanese customs officials
blocked the delivery.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' 8-year-old Nickelle Clark said
Thursday. ``I'm mad.''
   She sold more than 500 boxes of cookies this year, including
some to a sailor aboard the USS Midway who had written to say he
missed the annual treat.
   Troop 807 leader Manchetta White said a $2,000 duty tax
prevented the cookies from clearing customs and going to 35
servicemen who ordered them.
   American Airlines officials are trying to figure out what to do
with 402 boxes of Girl Scout cookies piled up in the back of their
ticket office here.
   The airline offered free passage for the cookies to the crew of
the carrier, which is based in Atsugi, Japan. They were shipped
April 26 but were returned after four days in a Japanese customs
warehouse.
   Jean Titus, American Airlines' general manager in Corpus
Christi, said she's working with American Airlines officials in
Tokyo regarding alternative methods of delivery.
   Although Japanese officials at the embassies in Washington and
Houston were not available Thursday because of a national holiday,
a representative in the honorary consulate's office in Dallas said
a $2,000 duty fee seemed high.

   The soldier was on guard duty and armed with a pistol when he
made his escape, said to Rainer Leonard, a spokesman for the West

   He identified the soldier as a sergeant who served with a border
unit and identified his companion as a construction worker. He said
the solider was posted by a 10-foot-high fence along the border at
the time of the escape.
   Police declined to release the names of the two East Germans or
provide other details of the escape according to regulations.
   The escapes brought the number of people fleeing communist East
Germany to West Germany this year to 38.

<TEXT>
   A television reporter has denied charges that he
paid two teen-agers to say Tawana Brawley was at a birthday party
during the time the young black woman claims she was kidnapped and
assaulted by a gang of whites.
   ``We offered no money, and we specifically told them we do not
pay for stories,'' WCBS-TV reporter Mike Taibbi said Thursday in
response to charges by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been acting as
spokesman Tawana Brawley's family.
   At a news conference called by Sharpton, a man who said he was
the father of one of the teens said his son never knew Miss Brawley
and had lied when he said he saw her at the party.
   His son and another boy received between $10 and $100 for the TV
interview, said the man, Gregory Fleming Sr.
   Taibbi, appearing on the air later Thursday, said he had given
one of the two unidentified teens $10 for gas. Earlier, Taibbi
acknowledged paying for sodas at a fast-food restaurant, but said
no money ever changed hands.
   Sharpton labeled the Wednesday night report ``a media hoax built
on the whims of young kids and the paranoia of some crack addicts
in Newburgh,'' an upstate city near Miss Brawley's hometown of
Wappingers Falls.
   In a statement Thursday afternoon, WCBS-TV said it stood behind
the report.
   Miss Brawley, 16, was found Nov. 28 inside a trash bag with
racial slurs scrawled on her torso and feces smeared on her body.
She claimed to be the victim of a sexual and racial assault
involving up to a half-dozen white men, including one with a police
badge.
   Sharpton and two attorneys, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox,
have refused to allow Miss Brawley to appear before a state grand
jury investigating the case and have charged prosecutors with a
cover-up.
   During the WCBS-TV broadcast, an unidentified witness who
appeared with his face concealed said he saw Miss Brawley at a
birthday party in Newburgh during the four-day period when she
claimed she was held captive. He also said she spent time with a
former boyfriend during that period.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams, who is the special prosecutor
for the Brawley case, issued a statement saying: ``All aspects of
this case, including reports that Tawana Brawley may have been seen
in Newburgh, are under continuing investigation.''
   In a separate development, Sharpton and other civil rights
activists arrested during a protest against racism last December
walked out of a court appearance Thursday after a judge refused to
move the proceeding into a larger courtroom. Criminal Court Judge
Albert Koch issued bench warrants for 18 defendants.

   The Communist Party daily Pravda today heaped
praise on Chinese reforms that have attracted foreign investment,
and it called for a rebirth of the work ethic to bring similar
prosperity to the Soviet Union.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made favorable references to
recent Chinese economic experiments, but Pravda's article was the
most complimentary report yet on reform in the neighboring
communist state.
   Today's article on China's Tianjin region, one of 14 open
economic zones, set forth a list of accomplishments and credited an
inspired workforce for the success of ``Chinese perestroika.''
   ``Perestroika'' is the name of Gorbachev's reform program that
aims to rebuild the Soviet economy and society. Soviet proponents
of perestroika, which means ``rebuilding,'' have encouraged broader
use of joint ventures to draw foreign investment to Soviet industry.
   But an array of problems faces the foreign businessman in the
Soviet Union. They include low worker productivity, unreliable
delivery of supplies, poor storage and transportation facilities,
and a lack of convenient and comfortable accommodations.
   China's open economic zones contain only 8 percent of the
nation's population but account for more than a quarter of its
industrial production and 40 percent of all exports, Pravda said.
The zones were created four years ago.
   The authoritative newspaper said the special economic zones had
been successful in attracting foreign capital and joint ventures
because the Chinese built support facilities needed for
international trade.
   In the Tianjin region, architecturally unique buildings
``literally pop up like a mirage in the desert,'' Pravda said. It
reported that the region's developers built luxury hotels, a golf
course, sports clubs and other services that make Western
businessmen feel comfortable.
   Transport problems also were worked out ahead of time to ensure
enough shipping capacity to foreign customers, and a lenient tax
system has drawn more foreign investment each year, the newspaper
said.
   Pravda said the Tianjin region alone had 80 contracts for
joint-venture enterprises and that capital investment in the region
last year exceeded $100 million.

   ``E.T.'' is coming home. Maybe to your home.
   The endearing little alien of ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial''
will be invading the home video market this fall with a hoopla
worthy of the most popular movie of all time.
   MCA Home Video and the Pepsi Cola Co. announced plans for the
mammoth publicity campaign at a news conference Thursday on a
Universal Studios sound stage decorated to look like a wooded scene
from the 1982 movie.
   The videocassette will be released on Oct. 27 at a retail price
of $24.95, said Gene F. Giaquinto, president of MCA Home
Entertainment Group.
   The Pepsi Cola Co. will support the release with the greatest
advertising campaign in its history, said Roger Enrico, president
of Pepsi Cola World Wide Beverages. Pepsi has commissioned a series
of television commercials featuring ``E.T.'' and will offer a $5
rebate on purchase of the video.
   Enrico said Pepsi will also support ``E.T.'' with displays in
more than 60,000 retail stores and will sponsor a sweepstakes
giving away more than 100,000 free copies of the video.
   Giaquinto said the two companies would spend $25 million
promoting the release.
   The movie, produced by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of an
endearing little alien from another world who became marooned on
earth and was befriended by a group of small children. The children
protect him from government agents and help him return to his own
world.
   ``E.T.'' has taken in more than $228 million in film rentals,
with the worldwide box office estimated at nearly $500 million.
   MCA, Pepsi and Spielberg's company will make a contribution from
the proceeds of the video sale to the Special Olympics. The group
supports activities for mentally retarded athletes.

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina may soon get a new symbol
because some elementary school students bugged the General Assembly.
   The House on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a bill to make the
praying mantis the state insect; the Senate had taken similar
action in March. Gov. Carroll Campbell also supports the proposal,
spokesman Tucker Eskew said.
   Rep. Woody Aydlette, whose lighthearted promotion of the
cockroach was rejected, did succeed in adding an amendment that
would require a three-fourths vote instead of a majority vote in
the General Assembly to adopt state symbols.
   Aydlette said it's a waste of legislators' time and taxpayers'
money to add to the already long list of state symbols.
   The students in the Dacusville-Crosswell Enrichment Program in
Perkins County initiated the legislation as part of a class project
to learn how the legislative process works, Dacusville Elementary
School Assistant Principal Tammy Hamlin said Thursday.
   ``They realized the state didn't have an insect and went to
work,'' she said.
   The students did research to determine the proper insect to
represent the state and voted for the praying mantis.
   The students got their state senator, Nell Smith, to propose the
bill, came to Columbia to testify, wrote letters to legislators and
crafted praying mantis brochures, bumper stickers and buttons.
   ``The lobbying was extensive,'' said state Rep. Larry Martin, a
Dacusville Elementary School alumnus.
   When the bill hit a snag in the House, the children wrote and
called the legislators who opposed it and convinced all of them but
Aydlette to remove their objections, Martin said.

   A man accused of robbing a BayBank
branch here earlier this year escaped from jail and, 90 minutes
later, held up the same bank and the same teller, police say.
   The teller recognized Steven W. Bergeron during the stick-up as
the same man who staged a hold-up at her window on March 25, said
Detective Sgt. Gilbert Larson. The suspect also apparently
recognized the teller.
   ``He said. `I want you to help me again.' She said, `No.' He
said, `I have a gun. Don't make me use it,''' Larson said.
   The teller handed over the money. Police would not disclose how
much was taken but Larson said it wasn't much. Police were
searching for Bergeron.
   Bristol County Sheriff David Nelson said Bergeron, 31, had
scaled a wall at the county jail earlier Wednesday, climbed over a
roof and slid down a drain pipe to escape.
   Bergeron, arrested at gunpoint at a motel March 31, had been
serving several jail terms and was awaiting trial on three bank
heists, including the one at the BayBank in March.
   The day before his escape Bergeron was sentenced to two
concurrent two-year sentences on charges of breaking and entering
in the daytime with intent to commit a felony, and larceny.

   Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., the U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia, is the leading candidate to take over the Justice
Department's criminal division, a White House spokesman said today.
   ``There are others, but he's the leading candidate,'' said
Deputy Press Secretary B.J. Cooper. ``We're still doing background
checks.''
   Dennis, 43, a career prosecutor, would succeed William F. Weld,
who resigned March 29 in protest against Attorney General Edwin
Meese's continued leadership of the department. Meese has been
under investigation by independent counsel James McKay for more
than a year.
   Dennis was appointed U.S. attorney for the eastern district of
Pennsylvania by President Reagan in 1983 after three years as head
of the narcotics section in the Justice Department criminal
division. Before that he was an assistant U.S. attorney in
Philadelphia.
   If nominated by Reagan to the Justice Department post, Dennis
would be subject to confirmation by the Senate. If confirmed, he
would be the Justice Department's only ranking black official. He
is one of two blacks among the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys.
   Dennis has built a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of
political corruption.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, after warning
Nicaragua's Sandinista leaders against trying to gain military
advantage from the peace process, sought today to emphasize the
progress they and the Contra rebels have made in talks aimed at
reaching a long-term cease fire.
   ``They have made some progress,'' Wright said in an interview on
``CBS This Morning.'' He noted that agreements had been reached on
the location of cease-fire zones and the prospect of new talks next
week to arrange delivery of ``humanitarian'' aid to the rebels.
   ``Then they have agreed that they will begin serious and earnest
conversations about the full democratization of the country,''
Wright said. ``I remain hopeful,'' he added, despite continued
mistrust between the two sides.
   On Thursday, Wright joined the Reagan administration in
expressing concern that the rebels not be left on the losing side
of an unbalanced equation in the cease-fire talks.
   ``The message will be given to the ... Sandinista government
that the majority in the Congress would not look with favor at all
on any return or resort to military engagement,'' Wright, D-Texas,
told reporters.
   Representatives from the rebels' political directorate, the
Nicaraguan Resistance, were in Washington this week arguing their
case before State Department officials, members of Congress and the
news media. They accused the leftist government of dragging its
feet in the peace talks in order to stall U.S. ``humanitarian'' aid
for the rebels.
   Adolfo Calero, leader of the Contra directorate, said the $48
million aid package passed a month ago was intended to keep the
rebels alive as a fighting force inside Nicaragua during a 60-day
truce, while negotiations went forward on a longer-term cease fire.
   ``That is being thwarted by the Sandinistas,'' he said. ``It's
broken down. In Nicaragua, there are no steps being taken at
present toward reconciliation.''
   Wright said he had asked State Department officials at a meeting
earlier in the day to expedite aid money to the rebels, including
at least part of $10 million earmarked to pay the expenses of a
verification commission to oversee the peace process.
   Without aid soon, he said, ``the pressure would be entirely on
the Contras, they would wither on the vine and there would be no
incentive for the Sandinistas to negotiate in good faith.''
   But he said Congress wants equally to avoid giving the rebels
the ``false impression that we want (them) to rev up the war
again,'' and admonished the Contra leaders to continue peace
efforts.
   ``A near miracle happened at Esquipulas,'' the town in Guatemala
where the original regional peace accord was signed last Aug. 7,
the House leader said. ``A near miracle happened March 23 at
Sapoa,'' when the two sides agreed to a 60-day cease-fire. ``Let's
work for the third miracle.''
   ``We assured him we would continue to make it work,'' said
Enrique Bermudez, the rebel military commander, who joined the
directorate in a meeting with Wright. ``We will make an effort to
continue negotiating.''
   Discussions on a long-term cease fire have bogged down, and the
situation has been complicated by a dispute in Contra ranks over
negotiating strategy and who is to provide military leadership, a
split Bermudez said was being patched up.
   Criticism was harsh at the White House, where presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater accused the Sandinista regime of
``systematic moves ... to undermine the peace process and
intimidate its political opposition.''
   Fitzwater pointed to reports from Managua that police detained
opposition leaders, suspended two radio stations from broadcasting
and closed one station for 24 hours. He said Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega had ``once again held his true colors high, showing
that he has little intention of supporting a free press, of
allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms called for by the
Guatemala City peace plan.''
   The cease-fire agreement allows the rebels to receive
humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua if they gather in cease-fire
zones and the aid is delivered by a neutral agent. The only
shipments thus far have been to rebels based on the Honduran side
of the border.
   At a news conference, Calero accused the Sandinistas of trying
to force the rebels into a choice between ``hunger and surrender.''
   He said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and will not
enter the seven cease-fire zones which have been mutually agreed to
``if there is no assurance of delivery of the aid which has been
approved.''
   Much of the current problem stems from disagreement over who
should deliver the aid. The Contras had favored a Honduras-based
company, Circle G, but the Sandinistas rejected it because of past
work it had done for the CIA, Wright said. Several other companies
are now under consideration, including the Costa Rican national
airline.
   Wright said later after meeting with rebel leaders that there
appeared to be no immediate threat of starvation to the Contra
troops, but said the leaders were most fearful that a prolonged aid
drought would increase morale problems.

   For as long as most residents can
remember, Elliott Trueluck has walked downtown to a coffee shop
each morning, singing and talking to a pack of dog yelping at his
heels.
   Last week, however, a police officer opened fire on Trueluck's
canine followers, killing at least two of them. Now, the disabled
veteran says he's afraid to go out into the streets of this small
southeastern Georgia town.
   ``It scared the I-don't-know-what out of me,'' recalled
Trueluck, 61, who is described by his wife as a ``shell-shock''
victim of World War II. ``I did what that (police officer) told me
to do and got out of there. What if he had turned the gun on me,
instead of the dogs?''
   Harriett Dixon, director of the Okefenokee Humane Society in
nearby Waycross, said police Sgt. James Mock killed several dogs on
April 29 with shotgun blasts and then used a billy club to beat
wounded dogs to death.
   Warrants obtained by the Humane Society and a witness charge
Mock with cruelty to animals for allegedly shooting and clubbing
the dogs. He is free on $500 bond.
   Mayor Harry Adams said Mock shot the dogs on orders from City
Hall after Trueluck had laughed off warnings to keep the animals
off city streets. An ordinance requires that dogs be leashed when
out of their owners' yards.
   But several people who work at a neaby shopping center said
unleashed dogs belonging to prominent white citizens roam the
center, ignored by police, while their owners are inside. Trueluck
is black.
   ``The actions taken by the policeman in this case are considered
just and proper,'' the mayor said at a news conference today. ``He
was performing his duty in accordance with prescribed procedures.''
   Adams said the dogs killed by Mock were considered mean, vicious
and a threat to the community. He said the city has decided to buy
a tranquilizer gun as a result of the incident.
   Witnesses disputed the mayor's contention that the dogs were
dangerous.
   ``I've walked right by them on the sidewalk and all they did was
wag their tails,'' said Judy Thompson, who witnessed the shooting.
``It's bad to think you live in a town where the cops just pull up
and go to shooting.''
   ``We watched him every day,'' said another witness, Rebecca
Jacobson. ``He had different dogs with him every day. He'd walk and
they would follow him. If one of them strayed, he'd sing.''
   The attack occurred as Trueluck was returning home with at least
eight dogs from his favorite coffee shop in this timber and farming
community about 100 miles southwest of Savannah. Ms. Jacobson said
she was working in a drug store at the shopping center when she
heard the shots.
   ``I ran out. ... He was out there beating them with a stick.
There was one injured dog that was trying to get away. He'd run a
little and sit down. We could tell he'd been shot in the back.''
   City officials said Mock killed two dogs. But Mrs. Dixon
contends that as many as six others may have been hauled off by
city sanitation workers before she arrived at the scene.
   Police Chief Dennis Martin said he has asked the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation to conduct an independent probe to determine if
any of the state's anti-cruelty statutes had been violated.
   ``My officers haven't done anything wrong,'' the chief added.
   Trueluck's wife, Myrtice, said he receives a small disability
check every month because he has never recovered from being ``shell
shocked'' while serving as a Marine in the Pacific during World War
II. A symptom of his condition is that he laughs at almost
everything.

   Hundreds of police carrying clubs ringed
the strikebound Lenin shipyard today, and workers inside said they
expected an assault. Workers at a huge southern steel mill said a
raid by riot troops had not ended their strike.
   The Roman Catholic Church criticized the police raid at Nowa
Huta steel plant outside Krakow and said authorities apparently was
planning similar action against the shipyard workers.
   The the government moved in draft legislation to punish
organizers of strikes and any forms of protest with up to one
year's imprisonment. The draft also suspends the already limited
right to strike by officially recognized trade unions.
   The Nowa Huta strike began April 26 after a successful one-day
stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city of Bydgoszcz
touched off Poland's worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981
military crackdown on the independent Solidarity union federation.
   The state-run radio said today work had resumed, but workers
said the strike was still on.
   The church statement, issued in Warsaw, came as three
church-appointed mediators told reporters they felt betrayed by the
police attack Thursday because an agreement had been within reach
to end the 10-day strike.
   State-run media reports said the Gdansk shipyard's director
warned strikers in a message broadcast over loudspeakers during the
night to leave or he would resort to ``other means.''
   A Pole who spent the night in the yard said about 2,000 strikers
were inside and ``it's very tense. You can see they are all under
great stress.''
   The workers began to worry about their low food supplies, with
supporters outside no longer allowed to bring gifts of bread.
   ``It seems they are going to use a different scenario than in
Nowa Huta,'' said senior Polish dissident Adam Michnik. ``They
probably want to take the shipyard by hunger.''
   During the night, police convoys periodically moved about this
Baltic port in a show of force. Inside the shipyard, Solidarity
lead Lech Walesa circulated among young strikers and vowed to be
``the last to leave'' the yard, where Solidarity was born.
   A note from strikers smuggled out of the shipyard Thursday
evening said: ``As far as we know, they (the authorities) are
preparing for a police raid.'' The strike at the 12,000-worker
shipyard began Monday.
   The government proposal to punish strikers was contained in a
previously announced bill to give the state special powers to speed
up its economic reform program. The draft was obtained by Western
news agencies in Warsaw.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said in March that the
government might require special powers to speed up its plans to
reform the ailing economy.
   Solidarity says it generally favors the direction of the reforms.
   But a statement by Walesa received today from inside the
shipyard said that, ``Society must be the co-author and partner in
the solutions.''
   Wage demands fueled by rapid inflation this year have threatened
to ``derail'' the economic reform program, the government said this
week, announcing that it would ask for the special powers.
   In the draft, which has yet to be presented to parliament, the
government would be empowered to change management structures,
order layoffs of workers, order liquidations, break-ups or mergers
of companies and fire managers.
   It also would allow for a freeze of wages and prices.
   Opposition activists said at least 32 strikers, including a man
whose legs were broken, had to be treated for beatings suffered
when security forces stormed the steelworks Thursday.
   The government denied anyone was injured in the pre-dawn raid.
   The Rev. Tadeusz Zaleski, who was with the strikers during the
raid, said riot police were beating people with ``very long heavy
sticks.'' He said they destroyed the altar where he said Mass for
workers.
   In its statement, the church said: ``We express deep sorrow that
an attempt of dialogue and social conciliation did not bring the
expected results.'
   On Wednesday, the church had sent mediators to both trouble
spots with the approval of authorities, the statement said.
   ``We feel shocked that in the course of the talks, which in
parts were very encouraging, the talks were brutally stopped,''
said one of the mediators, Andrzej Stelmachowski.
   A combine official said on state-run radio today that the plant
was quiet and ``strenuous work'' was going on. The radio also said
plant workers would this month receive 25 percent raises, half of
what the strikers had demanded.
   The Bydgoszcz strike and a two-day stoppage at another steel
mill ended with promises of pay raises to offset 42 percent price
increases.
   In addition to higher pay, the Nowa Huta and Gdansk strikers
demand reinstatement of free trade unions and fired Solidarity
activists and the release of political prisoners.
   Solidarity was born after a wave of strikes in August 1980 and
was banned two years later.
   Three times in postwar Poland, labor unrest that followed price
increases has toppled governments.

   Police arrested an Arab-American leader of the
Palestinian civil disobedience movement and ordered him deported,
Israeli officials said today. A government spokesman accused him of
advocating violence.
   Police arrested a Jewish settler in the shooting death of a
Palestinian shepherd. Another shepherd was wounded in the eye in
the incident.
   Israel radio reported that troops shot and wounded a 15-year-old
Arab boy in anti-occupation unrest today in the Gaza Strip town of
Khan Yunis.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said U.S. Ambassador
Thomas Pickering would protest the ordered deportation of Mubarak
Awad, who was arrested at his Jerusalem home at midnight (6 p.m.
EDT Thursday). U.S. Embassy officials said they had no information
on such a protest.
   In 1985 Awad established the Center for Non-Violent Studies in
Jerusalem, which calls on Palestinians to peacefully resist the
Israeli occupation of Arab lands captured during the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Leaders of the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising have adopted
many elements of Awad's non-violence strategy. Awad also provided
tours and information to foreign journalists covering the unrest.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Awad was ordered deported because he had gone beyond his calls for
non-violent protest and was responsible for leaflets that urged
Palestinians to throw gasoline bombs and stones.
   ``This is preaching violence,'' Pazner said, adding that Awad
had also called for a Palestinian state that would include all of
Israel.
   Awad said today he supported the establishment of a Palestinian
state alongside Israel, his lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, told The
Associated Press.
   Kuttab met Awad today in jail and was preparing an appeal
against his deportation.
   Awad said the deportation order came because the Palestinians
were showing restraint and using civil disobedience, Kuttab said.
   The move to expel Awad followed a crackdown on leaders of the
uprising, 20 of whom have been deported to Lebanon.
   Israel has also jailed 21 Arab journalists, including one
Thursday, in an effort to stifle news coverage of the proests.
   Benjamin Yaari, deputy legal adviser of the Interior Ministry,
said Awad was given the deportation order Thursday and that he has
three days to appeal to Israel's supreme court.
   Awad, 44, who also has a home in Wapakoneta, Ohio, was in Israel
under a tourist visa that expired last November, and he refused an
order to leave the country. Awad was allowed to remain following
strong U.S. pressure against the previous expulsion order.
   Authorities on Thursday arrested Elias M. Zananiri, managing
editor of the Arab weekly Al Awdah and of the Palestine Press
Service. The authorities have closed the Arab-run press service and
Al Awdah, which also has an English edition.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said Zananiri would be held for at
least 48 hours for investigation on charges of incitement to riot.
   The Palestinian death toll in the uprising that began Dec. 8
rose to 184 Thursday after a confrontation near the West Bank
village of Turmus Aiya, 17 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   Israel radio said the clash started when a Jewish woman spotted
several Palestinian shepherds in a field. The woman panicked and
called for help, and armed settlers as well as Arab villagers
rushed to the scene.
   It said the Arabs began to throw stones and a settler ``opened
fire, apparently at the stonethrowers, killing one and wounding
another.''
   An Arab reporter from east Jerusalem's Al Quds newspaper said
Jude Abdallah Awad, 28, was shot in the head and killed when the
settlers tried to drive away Palestinians working in their fields.
   Rizik Abu Naim, 29, was wounded in the right eye when he tried
to rescue Awad, said the reporter, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Police today arrested a settler in connection with the shooting,
said Israel Medad, spokesman for the nearby Shilo settlement.
Israel radio identified the suspect as Yisrael Zeev, a U.S.
immigrant. Police had no immediate comment.
   On Thursday, the army ordered that shops in the occupied lands
close for three days or be welded shut. The order promises to be a
major test of wills Saturday, when underground leaders of the
uprising said shops should remain open.
   Near the West Bank village of Beita, about 1,000 settlers, some
carrying rifles, marched and waved Israeli flags Thursday where
Jewish settler Tirza Porat, 15, and two Palestinians were killed in
a clash April 6.
   They retraced the route followed by Miss Porat and teen-age
hikers until the clash. An army investigation concluded that she
was accidentally shot by an armed escort of the hikers. Jewish
settlers have alleged the Arabs caused her death by stoning the
teen-agers.
   Several Jews from ``Stop the Occupation'' movement demonstrated
in Beita to support the creation of an independent Palestinian
state.

<TEXT>
   A French secret agent convicted of manslaughter in
the 1985 bombing of an anti-nuclear protest ship off New Zealand
was freed today from exile at a French military base in the Pacific
because she is pregnant, Premier Jacques Chirac said.
   Chirac said the return of Capt. Dominique Prieur respects a
U.N.-mediated accord with New Zealand under which she was held.
   But New Zealand criticized Mrs. Prieur's release as ``a breach
of France's obligation under international law.''
   Mrs. Prieur, 38, and Alain Mafart, 37, were arrested after the
July 1985 Aukland Harbor bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship of
the environmental group Greenpeace. It was preparing to lead a
protest flotilla to Mururoa, a South Pacific island where France
conducts underground nuclear tests.
   A Dutch crewman on the Rainbow Warrior was killed in the bombing.
   ``Mrs. Prieur is now pregnant, and the accord foresaw that, in
this circumstance, she should be returned to Paris,'' the premier
said during a stop in the town of Agen where he was campaigning for
Sunday's runoff against President Francois Mitterrand.
   The New Zealand opposition National Party leader, Jim Bolger, a
strong critic of the U.N. accord, said the repatriations of Mrs.
Prieur and Mafart showed the original deal was worthless.
   Mafart was brought back to France in December after complaining
of a stomach disorder. New Zealand officials have tried and failed
to force the return of Mafart, who completed entrance examinations
for a French war college since returning to the mainland.
   Bolger said Chirac clearly believed he would benefit by bringing
both agents home before the election.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman had said previously that the return
one year early from exile ``concerned the person of Mrs. Prieur.''
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said she had left the atoll
of Hao but did not say when she would arrive in mainland France.
   He said the government was surprised at the protests from New
Zealand Prime Minister David Lange.
   In a statement issued by its Amsterdam office, London-based
Greenpeace said it was ``surprised and angered'' about Mrs.
Prieur's return to France.
   The Greenpeace statement said the Dutch government ``was either
informed about the intention to release Prieur, or it was lied to
in that respect.''
   Last month, a Dutch Foreign Ministry official traveled to the
Hoa atoll to investigate the terms of Mrs. Prieur's detention.
   The two agents were sentenced to 10 years in prison after
pleading guilty to manslaughter. But under the agreement negotiated
by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, New Zealand
turned the agents over to France on the condition that they stay at
a military base on Hao, near Mururoa, until July 1989.
   The accord had stipulated that the two could not leave the
island without the consent of New Zealand.
   As part of the agreement, Paris apologized for the bombing, paid
$7 million compensation and promised not to block New Zealand
exports to Europe.
   Mrs. Prieur is married to Joel Prieur, who was a Paris
firefighter at the time of her arrest and now works for the Defense
Ministry. He has visited her frequently since her transfer to Hao.

<TEXT>
   Jorgen R. Jenk, who played a key role in Denmark's
World War II resistance to German occupation and headed the
silverware firm George Jensen Inc. in New York, has died. He was 65.
   Jenk died Monday at Charing Cross Hospital of heart and liver
failure, his widow, Faith Jenk, said.
   Jenk also promoted medical and fertility advances in the Third
World.
   Born March 20, 1923 in Kerteminde, Denmark, Jenk joined the
resistance as a student and was involved in underground newspapers
and acts of sabotage.
   He was part of an operation that smuggled most of Denmark's
8,000 Jews to safety in Sweden in 1943, The New York Times said.
   Wanted by the Gestapo, he fled to Sweden and then England, where
he joined the London-based Special Operations Executive, which was
organizing sabotage behind German lines.
   Jenk parachuted back into Denmark in 1944 as one of some 50
Danish SOE agents. Ole Lippmann, chief of the Danish resistance,
picked him as his right-hand man.
   He and Lippmann accepted the German surrender of Kastrup Airport
in Copenhagen in 1945 and handed it over to Denmark's Allied
liberators.
   ``He was a very courageous and very energetic officer,''
Lippmann recalled in a telephone interview from his Denmark office.
   Jenk finished the war as a lieutenant and returned to England,
where he joined the colonial service and was posted to Nigeria,
then a British colony, in 1948.
   In 1950 he returned to Denmark and worked for an export company
before joining Fisons, the British fertilizer giant. In 1959 he
went to Bombay and helped found a partnership between Fisons and
the Tata group, creating the largest industrial conglomerate in
India.
   After working in Switzerland he moved to New York and from 1965
to 1969 was president of George Jensen on Fifth Avenue.
   In 1969 he joined the Carolina Population Center at the
University of North Carolina, specializing in family planning,
field projects and education in the Third World.
   From 1974 to 1976 he worked for the International Fertility
Program, and in 1976 joined the board of directors of KLI Inc. of
Pennsylvania, which makes surgical systems for Third World
countries.
   He continued to work as a consultant on various projects for
developing countries until ill health forced him to retire in 1984.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children.

<HEAD>Mom Goes To School To Keep Son Off Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOONSBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Her son thought it was a terrible idea,
but Debbie Crampton says she's glad she went to high school with
him so he could avoid a three-day suspension.
   ``I would suggest it to any parent who is trying to understand a
problem at school or worried about why their kid's grade dropped,''
said Ms. Crampton, whose son, Allen, was suspended for acting up in
class.
   When Boonsboro High School officials decided to suspend the
sophomore, Ms. Crampton decided it was more important to keep him
in school. She proposed to join him, and the school took her offer
up.
   ``They get zeros for all the work they miss and that brings
their grade down and he couldn't afford to have his grades go
down,'' Ms. Crampton said Thursday after her third and final day of
classes.
   Her son was less than enthusiastic.
   ``It's terrible,'' he said. He didn't elaborate.
   Ms. Crampton, a 1972 graduate of Boonsboro High, said her first
day back in school was a little stressful. She's a smoker, but
could not light up.
   ``In fact, I got caught chewing gum in English class. I had to
spit it out,'' she said.
   She also got homework in math and science.
   ``I think he'll be more careful now and listen a bit now,'' Ms.
Crampton said. ``I didn't think he minded at first, but when we
were coming home, he asked me if it was my last day. He was glad to
have it over with.''
   Boonsboro Principal Joseph Robeson said letting parents attend
was a good idea.
   ``I think first of all it gives the youngster the clear
impression (that) they (the parents) would go above and beyond what
they normally do to improve a situation,'' Robeson said.

   President Najib of Afghanistan said
today he stood ready to bring Moslem rebels into his government but
that his army would fight them if necessary.
   The Soviet Union, which has been backing his socialist
government, is scheduled to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops
from Afghanistan starting May 15. Some diplomats have said the
departure of Soviet soldiers will leave Najib's forces unable to
repel the U.S.-supplied guerrillas, who already control much of the
country.
   But Najib said today after a three-day visit to India that his
army would deal ``a heavy and severe blow'' to the Pakistan-based
guerrillas if they continue to fight.
   The rebels have refused to participate in any government headed
by Najib.
   Asked today at his news conference if he would step aside as
president to facilitate what he calls ``national reconciliation,''
Najib replied: ``I would like to tell you that the Afghan Loya
Jirga (national assembly) was convened last November and endorsed
the new constitution of the republic and elected the president for
a seven-year term.'' Najib's mandate would end November 1994.
   Najib said the Mujahedeen ``are actually doing a political
suicide'' by refusing to talk with his government.
   Meanwhile, a Mujahedeen statement issued today in New Delhi
attacked what it called ``India's misconceived policy of taking
(the) side of (the) criminal regime of Kabul.''
   The Afghan president met Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and several
top government officials during his stay in New Delhi. Both the
Afghans and Indians have talked of warm relations between the two
countries, who share a common enemy in Pakistan.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up
the socialist government against attacks by Islamic guerrillas. The
Soviet withdrawal is scheduled to begin under an agreement signed
last month by the Soviet Union, the United States, Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said today that more than 10,000
refugees were returning to Afghanistan each day. It gave no details
and did not say when the number rose to that level.
   A week earlier, officials in the Afghan capital of Kabul said
130,000 refugees had returned since January 1986.
   At least 3 million Afghans have fled their country during the
decade-long civil war. They are mostly housed in refugee camps in
Pakistan and Iran, and the Kabul leadership is attempting to draw
them back to Afghanistan as Soviet troops begin to withdraw.
   Najib said today the deposed Afghan king, Zahir Shah, was also
free to return home to participate in politics.
   He was overthrown in 1973 by a cousin, who was assassinated in
1978. Afghan refugees and some Western officials have suggested
that the deposed king's return might pave the way for a transition
of government.
   An Indian official, speaking after Najib's news conference, said
India had played an informal role in talking with the ousted king,
as well as the United States, the Soviet Union and Pakistan.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he added, ``The impression
we gathered from the Afghans (is that) they are trying to broaden
the base of their government.''
   Najib also said he had rejected a petition by foreign reporters
to free an Italian journalist and a French photographer jailed on
espionage charges. He said the two men, who were captured after
entering Afghanistan with the Mujahedeen, had engaged in
``subversive activities.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Staff Often Change Doctors' Test Orders _ for the
Better</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors' orders are not always followed by lab
technicians and clerks, but sometimes that's good, according to a
study published today.
   The study of two hospitals, reported in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, found that technicians and clerks
often changed doctors' orders for thyroid function tests.
   While they found that ``disturbing,'' the researchers were
surprised to find that, in many cases, especially when computers
were involved, the changes actually improved the tests.
   ``The net effect of the changes to orders by non-physicians was
to reduce the number of inappropriately tested patients from 37
percent to 25 percent,'' the researchers said.
   The study was conducted at an unidentified university medical
center and a Veterans' Administration hospital.
   ``Laboratory testing is becoming increasingly complex, and it's
important to assure quality care throughout the whole system, from
the transmission of the order to the performance of the test,''
said Dr. Albert F. Finn, who wrote the report with two other
pathologists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   Changing doctors' orders could ``delay diagnosis as well as
increase unnecessary testing,'' the researchers said, and such a
practice is unacceptable under state laws and hospital bylaws.
   In 54 percent of the 181 cases studied at the two hospitals,
clerical or lab staff changed one or more test orders, the
researchers found.
   The university hospital's clerical staff, who filed doctors'
requests using computer-based test agendas that list appropriate
tests for specific diagnostic problems, ``significantly improved''
the appropriateness of doctors' test orders, the study found.
   But changes made at the VA hospital, where clerks used
handwritten requisition slips, tended to make the orders less
appropriate, the researchers said.
   Finn said in a telephone interview Thursday that more study is
needed to determine how much staff members participate in testing.
   He and his colleagues recommended that non-medical staff review
laboratory test orders and bring improper requests to the attention
of the physician, as pharmacists do.
   But Dr. Edward T. Wong and Dr. Janice Nelson took issue with the
suggestion in an accompanying editorial, saying it ``would shift
the burden for the error from the physician to the ward clerk or
technologist'' charged with the review.
   They recommended a method used at the University of Southern
California Medical Center at Los Angeles, where Wong is vice
chairman of the pathology department.
   Doctors there use test request forms in which groups of
appropriate tests are linked to specific diagnostic problems so the
physician can avoid ``having to decipher and select from a list of
test names encrypted in jargon,'' they said.
   Wong said that with laboratory tests accounting for about 10
percent to 15 percent of total medical costs, it is important to
ensure that tests meet doctors' diagnostic needs.

<TEXT>
   Sandia National Laboratories
researchers have made a new superconducting film of material they
say could have important ramifications to future generations of
microelectronics and computers.
   ``These films are really like hitting the jackpot, and I think
we did,'' David S. Ginley, supervisor of Sandia's semiconductor
materials division, said this week.
   The thin thallium-barium-copper oxide superconducting material
loses all resistance to electricity at minus 285 degrees
Fahrenheit, which Ginley said is 13 degrees warmer than previously
achieved in thin film superconductors.
   Superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct
electricity without loss because of resistance. Improved
superconductors could lead the way to powerful and compact
computers, high-speed floating trains and other advances,
scientists say.
   The thallium-barium-copper compound itself was developed by
Allen Hermann, chairman of the physics department at the University
of Arkansas, and Zhengzhi Sheng, a chemistry professor at the
university.
   The Sandia researchers, including James F. Kwak, Ronald P.
Hellmer, Richard J. Baughman, Eugene L. Venturini and Bruno
Morosin, have been working on the new thallium-based material for
nine weeks, Ginley said.
   The films made by the researchers are about seven-tenths of a
micrometer thick and are deposited by layers on a substrate, which
is the material the film is put on.
   ``We heat the metals with a controlled beam of electrons, which
vaporizes the metals onto the substrate,'' Ginley said.
   The materials are then heated and cooled twice ``and that's what
makes them superconducting,'' Ginley said.
   The key to making the materials successfully is to carefully
control the thallium content of the film during the heating and
cooling process, called anealing, the researchers said.
   Hermann, who spoke with The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from Fayetteville, Ark., said he and Sheng announced
their discovery of the thallium-based compound Feb. 15.
   ``I think they did a terrific job,'' Hermann said of the Sandia
researchers. ``I'm very excited about their work.
   ``This means a number of things,'' he said. ``I see the
potential for people improving the performance of electronic
devices.
   ``They can be used on one-dimensional substrates, like wire or
fiber. This is very exciting to think about now in the commercial
realm of generators or motors or magnets,'' Hermann said.
   Traditional metal superconductors must be cooled to around minus
460 degrees Fahrenheit using expensive liquid helium. But the new
superconductors can be cooled with cheap liquid nitrogen.

<TEXT>
   Former hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann told his family
that American hostages in Lebanon were treated brutally because
they tried to escape, the French news agency Agence France-Press
reported today.
   Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontaine
arrived in Paris Thursday after being freed Wednesday from three
years of captivity. They were the last French hostages to be
released from Lebanon.
   Premier Jacques Chirac hinted that France might restore
diplomatic ties with Tehran, which he said helped secure the
hostages' freedom. The government denied reports that it had paid a
ransom.
   AFP quoted Kauffmann's sister Marie-Genevieve Dagin as saying he
shared a cell recently with Frank Herbert Reed, who was
``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate.'' Reed was
kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986 and is one of nine American hostages in
Lebanon.
   Kauffmann, 44, Carton, 62, and Fontaine, 45, were in the
Val-de-Grace military hospital for two days of examinations.
   In a statement issued after the AFP dispatch quoting his sister,
Kauffmann said he intended to speak fully at a news conference next
week and did not want anyone speaking for him or relaying his
impressions until then.
   Mrs. Dagin's telephone in Rennes was constantly busy this
afternoon when The Associated Press tried to call.
   She was quoted by AFP as saying her brother told her the
American hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group
Islamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried to
escape.''
   The dispatch did not make clear whether Kauffmann specified
which were mistreated for attempting to get away.
   Mrs. Dagin was also quoted as saying that she learned from her
brother that Fontaine was briefly detained with Terry Waite, the
special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waite disappeared
Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission in Lebanon seeking the release of
the hostages.
   Fontaine had said Thursday that he had shared a cell with
American Terry A. Anderson, the longest-held foreign hostage.
Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for the AP, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut.
   Kauffmann was kept in total darkness for a year and a half, his
sister was quoted as saying.
   ``He did not see the sun or a glimmer of light for a single
instant. An arm and a leg were chained permanently to a radiator,
even when he slept,'' she was quoted as saying.
   He told her he was moved to 18 different locations, sometimes
transported in a coffin, the agency reported.
   ``He told us that each time he feared he would not get out,
because there was no air,'' she was quoted as saying.
   Chirac also thanked President Hafez Assad of Syria and Lebanese
military authorities for their help in freeing the hostages.
   Tehran Television, monitored in Cyrpus, quoted Ali Reza
Moayyeri, an Iranian deputy prime minister for political affairs,
as saying Iran interceded ``for humanitarian reasons.''
   French goverment officials denied they paid ransom for the
hostages' release. But Britain and other countries accused France
of dealing with terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage
in Lebanon.
   In Batavia, N.Y., Anderson's sister Peggy Say said Thursday she
would go to Paris to talk to Fontaine.
   ``It's wonderful news for the French,'' Mrs. Say said. ``But it
makes it all the more frustrating and disappointing to compare what
their government does to what our government does.''
   Fontaine told a reporter from the French television Channel 5
that he ``passed the time playing dominoes and chess'' with
Anderson.
   Carton, Fontaine and Kauffmann appeared ashen and shaky as they
walked slowly down the airplane steps on arrival in Paris.
   Earlier, Kauffmann said that Michel Seurat, the 39-year-old
French researcher captured with him on May 22, 1985, probably died
of cancer. Seurat's kidnappers claimed he had been executed.
   Carton and Fontaine were kidnapped March 22, 1985.
   On Thursday, Chirac said normal relations with Iran ``could be
envisaged.''
   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations last summer over
Iranian Embassy employee Wahid Gordji, who refused to submit to
questioning about a series of bombings in Paris in September 1986.
   Reports in Paris and Beirut said that in exchange for the three
Frenchmen, France agreed to repay the outstanding balance on a $1
billion loan made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, ousted in
the Iranian fundamentalist revolution of 1979.
   On Nov. 11, 1986, six days before France agreed to a $330
million payment, pro-Iranian extremists released two French
hostages. On Dec. 24, another hostage was released.
   Ten French hostages have been released since Chirac's government
took office in March 1986.
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua denied press reports that
ransom had been paid for the hostages.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises in Nation's Industrial Disasters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from this week's industrial disasters rose to six
today with the discovery of two more bodies at the still-burning
Shell Oil Co. refinery at Norco, La., as investigators began
looking into a Los Angeles skyscraper fire and explosions at a
Nevada rocket fuel plant.
   The string of accidents began Wednesday afternoon when
earthquake-force explosions destroyed the Pacific Engineering
Production Co. building and 11 others at a Henderson, Nev.,
industrial park, killing two people and injuring more than 255
people.
   That night, fire broke out at the 62-story First Interstate Bank
tower, California's tallest building, incinerating four floors and
causing $450 million damage. One worker was killed when he became
trapped in an elevator and 40 other people were injured.
   A few hours later, explosions that broke windows 20 miles away
in New Orleans set off fires at the Shell refinery. Three people
were found dead, and four more were still missing this morning,
said Wendy Jacobs, a Shell spokeswoman. Four-two people were
injured as windows shattered and doors and roofs were torn off
throughout Norco.
   Small, stubborn fires continued to burn today at the refinery
complex, fueled by residual gasoline and oil in tangled lines and
equipment, but the towering blaze that sent black smoke over the
area was out. A specially trained crew of 25 plant workers poked
through the wreckage today, looking for the missing men, said Sarah
Colletti, a plant spokeswoman.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
the Environmental Protection Agency sent investigators to the
refinery today to assist Shell in determining the cause of the
accident.
   Investigators hadn't determined the cause of the skyscraper
inferno yet either, and Los Angeles fire officials said they were
calling on the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to
help because of the severity and scale of the blaze.
   The request doesn't necessarily mean arson is suspected, but
rather that there is a need for the ATF's technical expertise, said
Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo.
   Fire officials cited a ``flashover effect,'' a phenomenon in
which materials become superheated, causing a firestorm, in
explaining the blaze's rapid spread.
   In Nevada, union and plant officials debated about safety at the
Pacific Engineering building, where ammonium perchlorate, a key
fuel component for the space shuttle and U.S. military rockets was
produced.
   Union officials said they had complained about safety at the
plant, but company officials denied there was a problem.
   ``This plant is, in my opinion, one of the worst I have ever
been into,'' John Molovich, safety and heath technician with the
international Steelworkers Union, said in a letter following a
September 1982 tour of the plant. The letter was released Thursday.
   ``I cannot understand how this plant has not been blown off the
face of the earth, given the product it manufactures,'' Molovich
wrote.
   But Fred Gibson, the company chairman, responded: ``It is a safe
plant and I am stating there have been no fires there. We had
inspections from OSHA and we had no continuing problems with
anything.''
   Laury Lewis, general manager of the State Industrial Insurance
System, said his records indicate Pacific Engineering ``has always
been a pretty good risk.'' His records, he said, indicated no
previous multiple injury problems or explosions.
   Pacific Engineering was one of two plants in the United States
that made ammonium perchlorate. The other is Kerr-McGee, whose
plant is just a mile away from the site of Wednesday's destruction.
Ammonium perchlorate production there was halted until the cause of
the accident was determined, and officials at rocket manufacturer
Morton Thiokol Inc. said there could be an effect on the nation's
space program.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines today sued its pilots and
machinists unions for $1.5 billion, accusing them of trying to
destroy the financially embattled carrier so they can buy it at a
``bargain basement price.''
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Miami by Eastern and
its parent, Texas Air Corp., accuses the Air Line Pilots
Association and the International Association of Machinists with
racketeering, extortion, fraud and defamation.
   The suit marked a new salvo in the airline's rancorous relations
with its unions. Since it was bought by Texas Air, management has
pressed the machinists to accept deep wage cuts it deems necessary
to return Eastern to profitability.
   The suit's accusations against the unions include charges they
conducted a public ``smearing'' of the carrier's reputation, staged
illegal work slowdowns and tried to undermine worker loyalty,
Eastern said in a press statement.
   ``We can't provide any (further) comment on it,'' said Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Charles Bryant, president of the machinists local, was returning
to Miami from a convention in Atlanta and could not be reached for
comment. ALPA spokesmen in Washington also could not immediately be
reached.
   The Eastern-Texas Air complaint alleges the unions were
``attempting to obtain ownership and control of Eastern through an
extortionate scheme to smear the company's reputation.''
   If the unions failed in their attempt to drive down Eastern's
price, they were willing to ruin the company ``to maintain the
excessive wages and bring back the high fares prevalent until
deregulation changed the industry 10 years ago,'' Eastern contended
in a news release.
   Named in the complaint were ALPA and its Eastern Master
Executive Council, the IAM and its District 100, and respective
local union leaders, including Bryant and John J. Bavis Jr. of ALPA.
   Eastern, whose losses of some $900 million in the past 10 years
include a $181.6 million loss last year, was bought by Texas Air in
1986 for $676 million. The Miami-based carrier's unions had tried
to halt the sale, making their own offer for Eastern.
   The Federal Aviation Administration last month announced it was
seeking $823,000 in penalties from Eastern for past safety
violations and then began a plane-by-plane inspection of the
carrier.
   Last year, Eastern paid $9.5 million in FAA fines levied for
safety violations.
   On Thursday, the House Public Works and Transportation Committee
approved a non-binding resolution on Thursday urging the U.S.
Transportation Department, parent of the FAA, to widen the probe of
Eastern and Texas Air.
   The resolution urges the department to look more closely at how
Texas Air and Eastern practices might affect the public and company
employees.
   It also seeks to have the department use its findings in
deciding whether to allow Texas Air to make operating changes, such
as selling its Boston-New York-Washington air-shuttle service.
   A federal judge has blocked Eastern from selling the profitable
shuttle service; Eastern is appealing the order.
   The Transportation Department announced last month that it had
begun investigating the management, financial status and safety
practices of Texas Air, Eastern and another Texas Air subsidiary,
Continental Airlines.

   Vice President George Bush said today
he did not authorize statements by campaign aides calling Attorney
General Edwin Meese III a campaign liability and said their views
did not reflect his own.
   While campaigning on a family farm near here, Bush was asked
about a published report quoting campaign aides Peter Teeley and
Robert Teeter as suggesting Meese should resign.
   Bush in the past has declined to comment on whether the
embattled attorney general should step aside, claiming he did not
want to prejudge the case.
   The vice president said he was unaware of the comments of his
two top aides. ``I haven't authorized anything. Now I have to get
on the phone and find out what they said,'' Bush said.
   The Detroit News, in a story published today, said Teeley,
Bush's communications director, and Teeter, a senior campaign
adviser, made the comments in interviews this week in Washington.
   ``Meese is a liability,'' Teeley said.
   ``All things considered, you would rather not have that problem
going on right now,'' Teeter said. ``No one is arguing that it is a
plus to have that situation going on over there.''
   Meese is being investigated by independent counsel James McKay
in connection with a government contract with the New York
City-based Wedtech Corp. Questions also have been raised about his
role in a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project, a Justice
Department lease, and involvement in department policy on
telecommunications industry issues at a time when he owned regional
Bell stock. Meese has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``What a guy like Meese does is take away the opportunity to
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss,'' Teeley said.
``I mean, you are consistently asked about Meese's problems, how
you deal with it, how you stand, one thing or another, and that
just totally diverts attention from the message that you are trying
to get across.''
   Teeley said he doesn't know if Bush has talked to President
Reagan about Meese.

<TEXT>
   Emergency crews searching the smoldering
wreckage of a refinery discovered two bodies today, raising the
death toll to three and leaving four men missing in the blast that
shattered plate glass windows 30 miles away.
   Wendy Jacobs, a Shell spokeswoman, said the two were among six
employees who had been missing since the explosion.
   Police today patrolled virtually windowless Norco to protect the
town's bank, furniture store and other businesses. The local co-op
lost most of a wall facing the plant when the devastating explosion
cut loose.
   At least three Shell Oil Co. employees died and 42 other people
were injured in the blast in a catalytic cracker Thursday morning.
   This morning small, stubborn fires continued to burn, fueled by
residual gasoline and oil in tangled lines and equipment, but the
towering blaze that sent up clouds of black smoke had died out.
   Twenty-five members of the plant emergency crew went into the
maze of hot, twisted metal searching for the missing, said plant
spokeswoman Sarah Colletti. Tight security prevented anyone else
from entering the plant.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
the Environmental Protection Agency sent investigators to the
refinery today to assist Shell in trying to determine what caused
the explosion.
   ``It went `Boom!' and then `Boom!' again,'' said Adam Mashia,
65, who lives less than a mile from the plant. ``It knocked me to
the floor and as I was getting up, it knocked me down again.''
   The force of the explosion broke windows in New Orleans's Garden
District, 30 miles down the Mississippi River.
   People in Slidell, 45 miles distant, said they also felt the
blast. The fire that broke out in the refinery forced the
evacuation of about 2,500 residents until it was brought under
control about 5{ hours later.
   Gasoline futures prices went up because of the damage to the
plant, which will create a squeeze on gasoline supplies in the Gulf
Coast, according to Greg Dreis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Authorities waited for the plant's remains to cool down today
before searching for the missing men, also Shell employees.
   Fred Foster, manager of Shell's Norco complex, said Shell has
established a claims center for victims.
   He also said a team of company investigators, joined by state
and federal authorities would begin looking for the cause of the
blast once the plant cooled down.
   Alan Migliore, who lives about three blocks from the refinery
complex, said: ``I was sleeping in the kitchen and it knocked me to
the floor. From there, I looked up and could see that the whole
area to the Shell was on fire. ... It blew both of the front doors
in, and the deadbolts took the frames out.''
   Damage at the refinery complex alone was expected to run into
the millions of dollars, said Shell spokesman Phil Schwin. The
accident ruptured the catalytic cracker, which converts crude oil
to gasoline, and seriously damaged control rooms and other
facilities.
   Residents of this town on the heavily industrialized, 75-mile
petrochemical corridor said they are fed up over recurring
emergencies that have forced them to evacuate their homes eight
times in 12 years.
   ``People were literally frightened out of their minds,'' said
New Orleans attorney J.T. Hill, who filed a $25 billion lawsuit
within hours of the explosion.
   ``I didn't know what happened,'' said another resident, Paul
Dauzat, 55. ``I went to look out the window and my wife said, `Why
are you looking out the window? The door is off.'''
   Damage was sustained on both sides of the mile-wide Mississippi
River, and Shell Oil said people needing repair materials could
charge them to the company's account at lumber yards on the river's
east and west banks.
   In Baton Rouge, Gov. Buddy Roemer said he didn't plan to ask for
federal disaster assistance because of Shell's willingness to
accept responsibility for damages.
   Just inside the gates of the Shell complex was a sign with the
familiar Shell logo, saying ``Complex Safe Days 616.'' As the fire
continued, workers took the sign down.

<DATELINE>MARION, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elementary school principal suspended a
5-year-old student and his 6-year-old sister for the third time in
the last three weeks for ``preaching'' outside the school.
   Principal Jim Gorst listened to Matthew Strode for 15 minutes
Thursday morning before suspending the boy for 10 days. He also
suspended Matthew's sister, Pepper, for refusing to enter the
school building.
   The Eastfield Elementary School principal had already given
their 10-year-old brother, Duffey, his third suspension last week.
   The incident Thursday was the latest round of a monthlong fight
between school officials and David and Robin Strode, the children's
parents. The Strodes say school officials are violating the
children's First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and religion.
   The three Strode children have insisted on preaching outside the
school, while school officials say they must enter the building and
go to class if they're on the grounds.
   David Strode, a machinist, has been a street preacher since 1981.
   ``It's not the preaching, the issue is the disruptive noise, the
screaming,'' Gorst said. ``It's stressful to our teachers and it's
stressful to our students.''
   From 7:30 to 7:45 a.m., Pepper stood quietly with Matthew behind
the school's rear entrance as he and Duffey alternately shouted
Bible verses. Duffey stood in the road outside the school gate, 100
yards away.
   ``You're in violation of school rules by being out here,'' Gorst
told Matthew and Pepper. After two more warnings, Gorst approached
Robin Strode's car, parked near the gate. Matthew and Pepper
followed.
   ``Come in the office, please, with your children. I think you
realize your children are in violation of school rules,'' Gorst
said.
   As Robin Strode left the school with Matthew and Pepper, after
meeting with Gorst, she said: ``I hope the Lord takes every last
one of them and does something to them. They ain't nothing but a
bunch of hypocrites.''
   The children are honor roll students and their mother has been
picking up their homework during their suspensions. If they're
suspended again, Matthew, Pepper and Duffey may not be promoted to
the next grade, however.

   Vice President George Bush said today
that efforts to hurt him politically with the Iran-Contra affair
were ``tested and tried in the primary'' and failed.
   ``I'm not worried at all,'' Bush said. ``I'm not vulnerable.''
   Bush has been dogged by questions about his role in the
arms-for-hostages affair throughout his candidacy. Although
Republican primary voters apparently cared little about the issue,
his Democratic opponents have indicated they will try to make
Iran-Contra an issue in the fall campaign.
   ``I'm not worried. It's been tested and tried in the primary,''
Bush said.
   Bush also shook off the published comments of two top aides
quoted as saying embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III was a
liability to Bush's Republican presidential campaign.
   ``I haven't authorized anything. Now I have to get on the phone
and find out what they said,'' Bush said.
   On Thursday, Bush called for retaining federal supports on sugar
and other crops even though he favors eventual elimination of farm
subsidies.
   The vice president is ending a three-day swing through the West
with campaign stops today here and in Montana. He was to visit a
local family farm and inspect an irrigation system before flying to
Billings, Mont., for a rally.
   Agriculture issues have been a main focus of his Idaho visit.
   ``Under a Bush administration, the (sugar) program would
continue even though I would try very hard to expand markets abroad
by breaking down barriers to American products,'' Bush said.
   Asked by reporters on Thursday in Boise if he advocates a
lifting of sugar import quotas, important in this region where
sugar beets are a major crop, Bush said he would not _ despite
Reagan advocacy of a global easing of farm subsidies.
   ``I know every administration gives lip service to eliminating
the sugar program and other programs, but it's not going to happen
unilaterally, believe me,'' he said.
   At last year's seven-nation economic summit in Venice, President
Reagan called upon U.S. trading partners to end all agricultural
trade subsidies, including quotas, by the year 2000.
   Reducing such trade barriers is currently on the agenda in a new
round of global trade talks under way in Geneva.
   Bush, who has the Republican presidential nomination in the bag
but is continuing to campaign anyway with an eye on the fall
election, said, ``I'd have a pro-Western policy.''
   ``There's room for a lot of economic growth and energy growth in
the West,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Bush said Reagan is withholding his formal
endorsement of his candidacy so it can be done with a degree of
fanfare.
   ``We're waiting for a dramatic moment to capture the applause of
the waiting political crowds,'' Bush said in an interview with the
local CBS affiliate in Boise.
   ``There's no question where Ronald Reagan's sentiments lie. He
told me this as recently as two days ago. We're waiting to do it so
it has a little flair to it.''
   To date, the White House has been mum on when the endorsement
will come, although presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has
indicated it will be soon.
   ``There's a lot of thinking going on on it, what would be best.
But the issue is not in doubt,'' Bush said. ``I don't think there's
a person in the United States, Democrat or Republican, who wonders
who President Reagan is going to support for president.''
   On another subject, Bush said that he would not pay money for
the release of hostages under any circumstances.
   Responding to a question centering on news reports of possible
French payments to seek the release of recently released French
hostages, Bush said:
   ``No, because I just think that will make others be taken
hostage.''
   On the sale of U.S. arms to seek the release of U.S. hostages
held in Lebanon, Bush conceded, ``to the degree that it turned out
to be arms for hostages, it was diametrically opposed to U.S.
policy. Our policy is not to do that.''
   ``Mistakes were made, yes, mistakes were made. But the genesis,
the creation of that was not arms for hostages.''
   Bush said he expected Democrats to use the Iran-Contra affair
against him as an issue ``because they're devoid of other national
issues.''
   The vice president was asked by local reporters if Sen. James
McClure, R-Idaho, a longtime friend, was under consideration as a
possible running made.
   Bush, who has been bombarded with similar questions about other
regional favorites wherever he goes, praised McClure highly but
once again stressed he has not yet begun the selection process _
preferring to wait until after the Democrats pick their full team
at their convention in July.

<TEXT>
   A spring party near Iowa State University
escalated into huge melee early today as party-goers threw beer
bottles at cars and used furniture to build a bonfire in the
street, and two people were arrested, police said.
   ``I was out there, and it was very, very close to being a tragic
situation. It was ugly,'' said Police Chief Dennis Ballantine.
   Police arrested Scott Thompson of Ames and Andrew Schoenewe of
Sioux City, both 21, on charges of simple assault after the
two-hour melee, and Ballantine said more arrests were expected.
   Police officer Dick Webb said authorities weren't immediately
sure if Thompson and Schoenewe are students at the 26,000-student
public university.
   One police officer was assaulted but didn't require treatment,
Ballantine said.
   Ballantine said neighbors complained about the private party
about a half-block north of a residence hall, and a police officer
issued a noise citation shortly before 2 a.m.
   More people joined the party until it swelled to about 1,000
people _ mostly students _ who started a bonfire in the middle of
the street, using furniture as fuel, the chief said.
   There were reports of vandalism, mostly to garden fences and
flower gardens, as well as incidents of people throwing beer
bottles at parked and moving vehicles, Ballantine said.
   Most of the crowd left when they saw officers arriving,
Ballantine said, and 200 to 300 people were left when about 30
police officers, Story County sheriff's deputies and campus
security officers moved in shortly after 3 a.m.
   He said the authorities finally cleared the area at about 3:40
a.m. City crews and campus workers spent were cleaning up the area
today.
   ``The party host lost control of his party,'' said Ballantine.

<TEXT>
   A private collector Friday paid $158,600 at a
Sotheby's auction for a three-page manuscript of Beethoven's
scrawled revisions of his Ninth symphony, his last.
   ``I came here specifically to buy the documents,'' said the
British collector, who refused to give his name.
   The work, commissioned by the Philharmonic Society of London,
was first performed in Vienna in 1824.
   The autographed pages of music, which have been recently
authenticated, include 27 bars of changes in the orchestral part of
the ``Ode to Joy,'' the choral last movement of the work.
   Sotheby's said Beethoven wrote down the music ``in his usual
haphazard style.''
   ``The alterations are not written down in any order, but are
seemingly jotted down at random, moving backwards and forwards from
movement to movement, some even added in pencil on top of earlier
instructions,'' said the auction house.

   Students and teachers in southern China's Hunan
province stopped classes and sold apples on the street to help
support their school but ended up losing $568 in the project, a
newspaper said Friday.
   The Guangming Daily said local education officials in Pingjiang
ordered the Chengguan Middle School to earn $3,378, or about $6.75
per student, as part of a work-study program encouraged by Beijing.
   The government, strapped for education funding, has urged
schools to bolster revenues by doing outside work.
   The school sent two teachers to neighboring Henan province to
buy 10,340 pounds of apples. Classes were suspended for two days
and the school ordered its 36 teachers to set up stalls on the
street and sell 55 pounds of apples each, the report said. The 452
students were required to sell 11 pounds each, the report said.

   The PLO's executive committee gave strong
indications that it will seek to intensify the uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories following Israel's raid on Arab
guerrillas in Lebanon.
   The 15-member committee ended six days of closed-door talks
Thursday night, its first session since Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat met Syrian President Hafez
Assad in Damascus on April 25.
   The Arafat-Hassad meeting ended a 5-year-old feud.
   The committee, which rarely announces in detail what decisions
it reaches, vowed in a communique issued late Thursday to
``redouble revolutionary effort by all ways and means and in all
fields.''
   It did not elaborate, but it was widely interpreted as meaning
an intensification of the 5-month-old uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip against 20 years of Israeli occupation.
   It was also seen as an indication that the PLO plans to step up
guerrilla attacks on Israel.
   An Israeli force pushed into south Lebanon on Monday in a
two-day raid against Palestinian guerrillas and their Moslem allies
who have carried out several raids into Israel in recent weeks.
   The Israelis reported killing 40 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
militiamen during the sweep. Three Israeli soldiers also died.
   The communique said the PLO leadership has ``taken all necessary
measures to maintain the uprising in the occupied territories and
to enhance the steadfastness of our people under occupation.''
   Arafat's reconciliation with Assad in the wake of the April 16
assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir _ believed to
be the PLO's main strategist in the Israeli uprising _ could be a
plus for the PLO.
   The reconciliation would strengthen the PLO's guerrilla campaign
against the Israelis. The Syrians control north and east Lebanon,
where they have about 25,000 troops, and could provide valuable
logistical assistance for cross-border raids.

   Vice President George Bush sought to distance himself today from
aides' comments that his campaign is being hampered by Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's legal problems and refusal to resign.
   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, kept up a heavy pre-primary schedule
in California, but Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis began a
long weeekend away from the campaign trail.
   Bush, in the face of Democrats' demands that Meese resign or be
fired, has consistently said he does not want to prejudge the
independent counsel's investigation of the attorney general.
   However, in a story in today's Detroit News, Peter Teeley,
Bush's communications director, and Robert Teeter, a senior
campaign adviser, were quoted as saying Meese's situation is a
problem for Bush. ``Meese is a liability,'' Teeley said.
   Bush, asked about it while campaigning on a farm near Twin
Falls, Idaho, said he was unaware of the aides' comments, hadn't
authorized them and would ``get on the phone and find out what they
said.''
   One day earlier, Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis, in a slap at Bush, his likely November opponent, said he
wouldn't accept a vice president too timid to speak out on tough
issues.
   Bush, on Thursday, was asked about the release of three French
hostages and said he would never agree to payments to secure the
release of Americans in captivity.
   Jackson, Dukakis' Democratic rival, was chafing at what he
called the premature ``coronation'' of Dukakis. Jackson stepped up
his criticism of party delegate-selection rules on Thursday, but
Dukakis virtually ignored him, training his fire instead on Bush.
   Jackson was campaigning today in California, whose primary on
June 7 will be the biggest _ and last _ of the season. Dukakis was
home in Boston, with no campaign events scheduled for the next few
days.
   Bush was hustling through a series of stops today in Idaho,
Montana and Nebraska. All three states have primaries in the next
month, but as Bush already has a numerical lock on the Republican
nomination, aides say he is aiming to build Western backing for the
general election.
   The vice president's comments about hostages came amid reports
that France had arranged Thursday's release of three French
hostages by agreeing to pay the outstanding balance on a loan
originally totaling $1 billion made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi of Iran. France has denied paying a ransom for the trio's
release.
   Bush said he would never agree to such an arrangement ``because
I just think that will make others be taken hostage.''
   The vice president's role in the Reagan administration's
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran has been questioned by Republican
and Democratic opponents alike. ``To the degree that it turned out
to be arms for hostages, it was diametrically opposed to U.S.
policy,'' Bush said Thursday of the deal.
   He conceded that the Democrats are making the Republican
arms-for-hostages plan a campaign issue, but claimed they are
``devoid of other national issues.''
   Bush's campaign was engaged in damage control after the vice
president's comments a day earlier that he sometimes refrains from
speaking up at Cabinet meetings because he is concerned about
leaks, and because he doesn't want President Reagan to be forced to
choose between him and other officials.
   Dukakis, campaigning in West Virginia on Thursday, seized on
that, saying that in Massachusetts he has a ``lively Cabinet, and
sometimes they get loud and contentious.''
   ``That's the way you get good give and take,'' the governor
said. ``I hope I'll have a vice president who speaks up and speaks
out.''
   Attempting to blunt the criticism, Bush spokesman Stephen Hart
said Bush's comments about keeping quiet at Cabinet meetings didn't
mean Bush avoids giving the president his opinions. Hart said Bush
has ample opportunity to do that privately.
   ``He reserves his advice for the president,'' the spokesman said
Thursday as Bush spent a day focusing on education issues.
   The vice president visited James A. Garfield High School in
predominantly Hispanic East Los Angeles. He sat in on a calculus
class taught by Jaime Escalante, whose teaching of advanced math to
disadvantaged students is the subject of a movie, ``Stand and
Deliver.''
   Bush said if he is elected, there will be a ``changing of
priorities to some degree'' to reflect more emphasis on education.
However, he cautioned; ``There has to be a limitation to what the
federal government can do.''
   That stance, too, drew a dig from Dukakis, who discounted Bush's
pledge to be an ``education president.'' The White House, he said,
must always be a supporter of education _ ``not just during
election years.''
   Jackson, for the second day in a row, attacked the Democratic
delegate-selection process, saying Dukakis' big lead in the
delegate race was ``inflated.'' By the latest AP delegate count,
Dukakis has 1,500 to Jackson's 927.
   Campaigning in Kearney, Neb., Jackson said he did not intend to
challenge party rules formally, but that he believed the support of
``super delegates'' should be roughly in line with the popular vote
in contests to date. Super delegates have a voice at the Democratic
National Convention by virtue of their elective or party offices.
   Jackson has won 28 percent of the votes in primaries so far but
is publicly supported by just 46 super delegates. Dukakis, who has
won 37 percent of the primary votes, is supported by 166 super
delegates.
   ``We'll be making appeals for fairness and we certainly hope
people will respond,'' Jackson said. ``What the people are saying
must not be covered up by all the ... talk of the coronation and
`the race is over.' The race is on.''
   Asked about Jackson's complaints, Dukakis campaign spokesman
Mark Gearan said only: ``These rules have been in place for some
time.''

<HEAD>Iraq's Kurdish Groups Form Front</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Kurdish political parties have formed
a united front to campaign for an autonomous homeland in northern
Iraq, the coalition announced Friday.
   The front consists of all Kurdish parties that have been
battling the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and it
seeks recognition of ``Kurdish national rights based on a voluntary
union,'' the newly formed front announced.
   A spokesman in Damascus, Syria, telephoned the announcement to
The Associated Press office in Nicosia. It was signed by Massoud
Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party, the largest group
in the new front.
   The new coalition is meant ``to strengthen the unity of our
struggle and escalate resistance in Iraqi Kurdistan in the face of
the war of genocide that the Iraqi regime is waging against the
Kurdish population,'' the announcement said.
   The Kurds' fight for autonomy, backed by Iran, has created a
second front in the northern mountains of Iraq in the 7 {-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq.
   The Kurdish struggle has forced the Baghdad government to divert
tens of thousands of troops from the main battlefields.
   There are an estimated 3.5 million Kurds in Iraq. They have been
fighting off and on for 50 years to gain autonomy in the northern
provinces that border Iran, Turkey and Syria.
   The main members of the new union are the Kurdish Democratic
Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, led by Jalal Talebani,
another veteran Kurdish fighter.
   It also includes four smaller parties, the Socialist Party of
Kurdistan, the Popular Democratic Party of Kurdistan, the Kurdish
Socialist Party and the Iraq Communist Party which is dominated by
Kurds.
   The announcement said that a joint committee of leaders of
member parties will lead the front.
   The Kurdish Democratic Party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
and some of the smaller parties in the front joined forces, under
Iranian tutelage, in 1986 to fight the Iraqis.
   Separate Kurdish nationalist groups are agitating for a degree
of autonomy in Turkey, where there are about 10 million Kurds, and
Iran, which has 5.5 million Kurds. They are not connected with the
Iraqi Kurdish front.

   Farmers in the border town of Poonch
have accused Pakistani soldiers of firing at them and interfering
with the harvest of wheat and other grains along the frontier, the
United News of India reported Friday.
   The news agency said the deputy commissioner in the town
appealed to the Kashmir state government to intervene.
   Both India and Pakistan have troops stationed along their
disputed border in Kashmir.
   UNI said that during a meeting between Indian and Pakistani
military commanders on April 17, Pakistan assured India there would
be no firing on local civilians.
   But UNI said nine shooting incidents have been reported since
then. It quoted the deputy commissioner's report as saying 13
civilians have been killed and more than 24 injured in unprovoked
firing by the Pakistanis in the past year.

<DATELINE>WHITE EARTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elaine M. Stately, an Indian activist
and co-founder of the American Indian Movement, has died of cancer.
She was 57.
   Stately died April 27 at her Minneapolis home and was buried
April 30 on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwestern
Minnesota, where she was born.
   ``We feel it was a very tremendous loss to us. She was very
actively involved in everything involved with Indians. She was very
involved with the youth and mothers, particularly young mothers,''
Clyde Bellecourt, AIM's first chairman, said today.
   Stately was chairwoman of the Minneapolis American Indian Center
for several years and worked for the city of Minneapolis as a
liaison with the Indian community.
   Stately had preached the value of education even as she
struggled to raise a family by herself on welfare.
   While four of her children were still at home, she received her
high school equivalency degree. She attended the University of
Minnesota before leaving to work for the city as an Indian liaison.
   Rebecca Stately said she remembers tagging along as a little
girl with her mother to the first gathering of the Concerned Indian
Americans, an Indian activist group that later changed its name to
the American Indian Movement.
   AIM was founded in Minneapolis in July 1968, said Bellecourt.
   ``She was very active in the efforts to develop the American
Indian Movement,'' Bellecourt said. ``She was one of the founders.''
   Stately is survived by six daughters, three sons, her mother, a
brother, a sister and 13 grandchildren.

<HEAD>Sneaky Mailing of Late Taxes May Not Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legal quirk may still allow late taxpayers
to get their forms postmarked before the April 15 filing deadline,
but officials caution against relying on the technicality to avoid
paying penalties.
   The backdated postmarks are available because of a special
Postal Service program for stamp collectors who want to get
examples of stamps postmarked on the first day they are issued.
   Theoretically, the remaining taxpayers who haven't filed could
also use the system to dodge the fact that they missed the deadline
last month, Linn's Stamp News, a newspaper for collectors, suggests
in its May 9 editions.
   But officials of the Postal Service and Internal Revenue Service
said such an action would be questionable.
   Only about 3 million tax returns of the nearly 100 million due
have yet to be filed, the IRS estimates, and most of them are from
Americans overseas, who still have time to file.
   The backdated postmark service is designed to help collectors
who cannot travel from city to city to be present for first day of
issue ceremonies for each new postage stamp.
   New stamps are sold only in the city of issue on the first day,
going on sale elsewhere the next day.
   With the special service, collectors can go to post offices in
their home towns and buy the stamps, place them on envelopes and
mail the envelopes in bulk to the first-day post office for special
cancellations.
   This service is usually offered for about a month after a stamp
is issued, to give collectors time to take advantage of it and to
ease first day pressure on the issuing post office.
   For the new ``E'' stamps, the time has been extended to May 21,
since they were released on rather short notice March 22, in
anticipation of the new postage rates that took effect April 3.
   Thus, in theory at least, a collector could put the new ``E''
stamps on an envelope containing tax forms, send it to Washington
for the first day cancellation, and it would then be delivered with
the date March 22 on the envelope, Linn's reports.
   Technically, then, the taxpayer could still send in the forms
``on time,'' under court decisions that have held a postmark is
evidence of filing.
   But IRS and Postal Service raised questions.
   The first-day-of-issue cancellations look different and are
treated differently from regular date cancellations affixed to
mail, said Dick Rustin, manager of the Postal Service's stamp
information branch.
   Regular cancellations do confirm the date something was mailed,
he said. But, for those which state ``first day of issue,'' he
said, ``we would not verify that the mail entered the system on
that day.''
   Tax forms arriving a month late with a March 22 cancellation
might also raise questions at the IRS, said spokeswoman Johnell
Hunter. She said the tax agency might check to see if the person
sending in the form had a history of being late.

<HEAD>U.S. Mediating Between Syria and Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the sidelines of its Middle East diplomacy,
the United States is trying to mediate between the leaders of Syria
and Lebanon who haven't been on speaking terms for more than a year.
   The U.S. diplomatic shuttle was begun nearly five months ago by
April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador-designate to Iraq, Reagan
administration officials said. Glaspie is focusing on attempts to
negotiate a more equitable power-sharing agreement between
Lebanon's Christians and Moslems.
   Her mission is particularly urgent in the face of a Sept. 23
constitutional deadline for presidential elections in Lebanon, the
officials said. No date has been set for the balloting.
   Syria, which controls parts of Lebanon with more than 30,000
troops, has proposed a formula granting increased power to
Lebanon's Moslem majority. The Christians, led by President Amin
Gemayel, have so far rejected the change, according to Lebanese
Christian groups in Washington.
   Ms. Glaspie, who has good ties with the Syrian leadership from
her days as a political officer in the U.S. Embassy in Damascus,
also has enlisted the help of the Vatican and the French government
to influence the Christians, one U.S. official said.
   Like other State Department officials he spoke on condition of
anonymity so as not to jeopardize Ms. Glaspie's diplomatic effort.
   But the United States does not appear to have much hope of
success.
   ``There are very difficult issues involved so that it's going to
continue to take effort, but we're committed to seeing what we can
do,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman said this week.
   Another official said that as time for negotiations runs out,
Ms. Glaspie is focusing on getting agreement from both sides to set
an election date and to curb violence by their forces.
   The United States is concerned that if elections are not held,
the ensuing power vacuum would plunge the country into anarchy and
leave it in the hands of the dozens of militias which virtually run
it now, he said.
   ``And of course there's the question of nurturing Syrian good
will,'' the official added.
   Syria is Moscow's main ally in the Middle East and a radical in
the Arab camp. Following a thaw in relations with Washington last
fall, Syrian President Hafez Assad promised to help obtain freedom
for American hostages believed held in Syrian-run sections of
Beirut.
   Under an unwritten 1943 agreement, the presidency in Lebanon is
reserved for a Christian and the posts of prime minister and
parliament speaker for Moslems. This year, however, some leading
Moslems have begun laying claim to the presidency too.
   Gemayel was elected in 1982 when his brother was assassinated
nine days before he was due to take office. He is not running for
another term and the only candidate who has officially declared is
Dany Chamoun, a former Christian militia leader.
   The change in presidents is seen by the Reagan administration as
a good opportunity to seek political reform. The need to stem the
factional violence is particularly urgent for the United States in
view of the collapse of the country's economy, which has all but
wiped out its middle class.
   The Lebanese pound, once the Mideast's most stable currency, has
nosedived to an all-time low of 700 to the dollar. Until 1985 it
was 2.5 to the dollar.
   But a Lebanese Christian official suggested there is more to the
U.S. and Syrian efforts than just a desire for calm in Lebanon.
   ``Lebanon is not the main thrust,'' said Robert Farah, executive
director of the Lebanese Information and Research Center in
Washington which represents a coalition of Christian forces.
   Farah said the United States is hoping it can parlay its help
with Syria's Lebanese problem into Syrian support for U.S. efforts
to start Israeli-Arab peace talks. Syria has so far rejected the
plan.
   The United States also is hoping Syria can use its influence
with the Palestine Liberation Organization to quell a five-month
uprising by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against
Israel's occupation, the U.S. official said.
   Syria hopes better relations with the United States may ease
some of its economic problems and ensure its role in future U.S.
diplomacy.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Against Dukakis In National Guard Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today rejected a lawsuit filed by
Gov. Michael Dukakis aimed at preventing Massachusetts National
Guard troops from training in Central America.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton, in a lengthy opinion, said
federal authorities have the power to give orders to National Guard
troops even when a governor objects.
   Keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionality of the Montgomery
Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that strips governors of the
power to decline such assignments unless their states are facing an
emergency that requires the Guard.
   Lawyers for the Justice Department had argued that the
Constitution gives Congress final authority over the nation's
entire military apparatus.
   Attorneys for Dukakis had claimed that governors reserve
authority over training the militia.
   At issue in the case was the legality of a Pentagon order
directing 13 public information officers to take part in training
in Panama and Honduras for two weeks in late May and early June.
   Dukakis, a Democratic presidential candidate who has been a
vocal critic of the Reagan administration's Central American
policy, had opposed the directive.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nine
other states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court
in St. Paul and lost. That case is now on appeal.

   A volunteer firefighter who authorities said
started blazes so he could look like a hero by battling them has
been accused of setting six fires since December.
   Michael DeWayne Perkins, 20, was charged after he admitted
setting the fires, Police Chief Albert Olguin said.
   ``He'd always be out there battling the fires,'' Olguin said.
``He was in a way trying to paint a picture of a hero. All the
firefighters thought of him as being a good firefighter.''
   Perkins was charged Thursday with one count of arson and jailed
in lieu of $10,000 bond. Olguin said the other arson cases would be
presented to a grand jury.
   Five of the fires were set in vacant buildings in Manor, east of
Austin, and one grass fire was set, Olguin said. No one was injured.
   Perkins reported the February grass fire just after it was set,
Olguin said.
   Manor Volunteer Fire Chief Hiawatha Nash declined to comment.
   Perkins had been a Manor volunteer firefighter since November
1986, said Dona Pope, assistant city secretary and fire department
secretary.

<HEAD>Meese Quietly Making Plans To Stay at Least Until September</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edwin Meese III is quietly making plans to
remain as attorney general at least until September.
   Despite widespread speculation that the heat generated by
Meese's legal problems will soon drive him from his post, there is
in his latest flap a largely overlooked clue from Meese himself
about his determination to stay on.
   Amid a stream of public disclosures about his assorted legal
problems, Meese last month privately and quickly accepted an
invitation to make an official visit to Japan as attorney general
Aug. 29-Sept. 1. Even though the trip itself has engendered
controversy, he gives every indication of planning to go.
   At Mel Krupin's restaurant, frequented by lawyers and lobbyists,
political operatives and pundits, Krupin says, ``They talk about
Meese but they don't make any comments'' about the propriety of
Meese's actions. ``Nobody knows if he's going to stay or go. They
just talk about how long he'll stay.''
   Independent counsel James McKay is not expected to indict Meese
in any of the handful of cases he has investigated, but McKay's
public report is expected late this month.
   McKay is expected to excoriate Meese for tolerating the
appearance of conflicts of interest even where they may not in fact
exist. Actions creating such appearances are forbidden by
presidential order.
   McKay then is likely to refer his evidence to Justice Department
internal ethics officers for recommendations on whether
administrative discipline by President Reagan is required.
   Most observers predict one of two outcomes: Either Meese will
seize the lack of an indictment as vindication and quickly step
down or McKay's move will allow him to continue for a decent
interval before departing voluntarily.
   A less widely held view is that Meese will not leave unless
Reagan forces him out.
   This debate has emerged from months of seemingly non-stop Meese
revelations.
   On Jan. 29, the Los Angeles Times disclosed a 1986 memo from his
confidant E. Robert Wallach to Meese that, to some, seemed to
suggest illegal bribes to Israeli officials to clear the way for an
oil pipeline.
   On Feb. 11, Meese's former White House colleague Lyn Nofziger
was convicted of lobbying for Wedtech _ a reminder that Meese
remains under investigation for his role on behalf of that Bronx,
N.Y., defense contractor.
   Unseen by the public until this week, an invitation for Meese
arrived March 15 from Japanese Justice Minister Yukio Hayashida to
visit Japan beginning Aug. 29. Meese's official visit would
coincide with a private conference on U.S-Japanese legal issues
running through Sept. 1.
   A day after the invitation arrived, independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh returned an indictment in the Iran-Contra case. Although
Meese was not among Walsh's targets, the charges were a reminder of
Meese's oft-criticized role in investigating that scandal.
   Sometime before the end of March, McKay privately told Meese's
attorneys he did not have enough evidence for indictments in the
pipeline case or in another matter in which Meese approved a major
reversal of Justice Department telephone antitrust policy while
owning stock in regional telephone companies that could benefit
from the reversal.
   On March 29, Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant
Attorney William Weld, head of the criminal division, quit on short
notice. They made it clear that they doubted Meese could run the
department effectively, and Weld told Meese that if he were the
independent counsel he would indict the attorney general.
   On April 1, McKay publicly announced his interim decision about
the pipeline and telephone cases, but added that his grand jury had
other matters to investigate.
   On April 4, Meese privately wrote Hayashida he was ``most
pleased to accept your gracious invitation to visit Japan at the
end of this summer.'' Justice Department political appointees this
week described this response as extraordinarily quick compared with
other matters they say have languished in Meese's office for months
and even years, such as whether to challenge two major Supreme
Court rulings on criminal law.
   On April 13, The Associated Press reported that a wealthy
Washington real estate family arranged to pay a $40,000 annual
salary to Meese's wife, Ursula, then won renewal of a $50 million
lease to provide offices for the Justice Department and quickly
sold the building for a $28 million profit. McKay is investigating
the matter.
   On April 20, Burns and Weld met Reagan and told him face-to-face
of their concerns. The president promptly summoned Meese, heard his
side and _ as Reagan has always done before _ reaffirmed support
for his longtime friend.
   On April 21, in his first mention of leaving, Meese told USA
Today, ``If an attorney general was indicted, I think that would be
a basis for stepping aside.'' But he added, ``I don't know of any
factor right now that would cause me to resign.''
   On April 26, the co-sponsor of the Japan conference mailed
30,000 copies of a letter from Meese to lawyers and businessmen
asking them to pay more than $3,000 apiece to join him at the Japan
conference.
   On May 3, Meese's solicitation letter and Japan trip plans were
disclosed in news reports. The Office of Government Ethics opened
an investigation of the arrangements.
   On May 4, William Barraclough, chief executive of the private
group planning the Japan conference, said, ``There are no
indications whatever that Ed Meese is going to back out.''

   A Cook County judge today ruled that a special
mayoral election should be held in 1989 so that voters can pick a
successor to the late Mayor Harold Washington.
   Circuit Judge Eugene Wachowski issued the ruling after listening
to arguments by a half dozen attorneys representing two groups that
had filed opposing lawsuits over the issue.
   Alderman Timothy Evans, considered a potential candidate and an
opponent of interim Mayor Eugene Sawyer, called the ruling a
``marvelous, marvelous victory'' for the citizens of Chicago.
   A spokesman for a group that favored allowing Sawyer to complete
Washington's term, which would have ended in 1991, said today's
ruling would be appealed.
   Wachowski said it was clearly up to the city Board of Elections
whether to call a special election in 1989, as it in fact did
earlier this week.
   Loud cheers and applause erupted as Wachowski announced his
decision, and he had to call for order.
   Russ Stewart, representing a group called United Citizens of
Chicago and Illinois, had argued against holding a special
election, saying that Sawyer was rightfully elected by the City
Council in December.
   As a result, Stewart told the judge that Sawyer should be
allowed to serve until the next regularly scheduled election in
1991.
   ``We do not believe there has been any disruption in government
from having the vacancy caused by the death of Harold Washington,
and the filling of that vacancy by Mr. Sawyer,'' Stewart said.
   But Tom Johnson, an attorney for a group called The Coalition To
Let The People Decide in 1989, contended that state law clearly
says a special election must be held if more than 28 months remain
in the unexpired term of a vacant municipal office.
   The question is ``whether the voters, the people in the
neighborhoods, will have a chance to participate in deciding who
will govern the city of Chicago for the remainder of (Washington's)
48-month term,'' Johnson told the judge.
   Washington died Nov. 25 of a heart attack and Sawyer was elected
by the city council a week later. Hundreds of Washington and Evans
supporters demonstrated against what they said were ``back-room
deals'' that unfairly left the citizens out of deciding who should
be mayor.
   Evans declined to comment on whether he would run in the special
election, saying, ``You'll have to tune in to see.''
   Kenneth Hurst, president of the United Citizens group and a
former GOP candidate for mayor, said he would appeal the decision.
   He described the group as a non-partisan watchdog organization
seeking fair government.

   A man who pleaded guilty in a bungled
murder-for-hire plot was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a judge
who also ordered that he submit to a psychiatric examination.
   Chief U.S. District Judge James DeAnda imposed the maximum
sentence Thursday to William Clayton Buckley of Knoxville, Tenn.,
rejecting prosecutors' recommendation of a 10-year term.
   DeAnda ordered that Buckley, 36, serve the sentence consecutive
to terms totaling 29 years imposed in three other states in cases
involvng assaults.
   The judge said he would resentence Buckley after he was examined
by a psychiatrist.
   Buckley pleaded guilty in a botched attempt to kill a man whose
former girlfriend had answered a ``gun for hire'' advertisement in
Soldier of Fortune magazine.
   Richard Michael Savage, who placed the ad, was convicted last
month in Brownsville of masterminding the attempted murder of Dana
Free. Savage has not been sentenced.
   Savage hired Buckley and Sherry Lynn Breeden, also of Knoxville,
to kill Free, whose ex-girlfriend was angry over losing her life
savings in a business deal with him, testimony showed.
   Buckley and Ms. Breeden botched the job when they threw grenades
into a Pasadena house shortly after Free had left.
   Free's ex-girlfriend, Alive V. Brado, died of emphysema in
October in Kentucky, where she was serving a five-year term
stemming from the plot against Free.
   Buckley and Ms. Breeden pleaded guilty in the Pasadena attack.
   Ward C. Lambeth, of Denver, pleaded guilty to conspiracy for
delivering $15,000 of the $20,000 Ms. Brado agreed to pay for
Free's murder. He was sentenced to five years in prison.

   Attorneys for two journalists who accuse U.S. and
Contra officials of running an illegal drug and arms smuggling ring
said today their case is being thwarted by federal officials trying
to protect Vice President George Bush.
   The comments came during a hearing on the $24 million damage
suit that was filed in federal court here by journalists Tony
Avirgan and Martha Honey. They are represented by The Christic
Institute, a liberal policy group.
   Avirgan was injured in a May 1984 bombing which the two blame on
a group that includes Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, two
businessmen who were charged with conspiracy and theft in the
Iran-Contra case.
   The lawsuit does not cite any U.S. government officials among
its 29 defendants. Central to the lawsuit is the claim that the
defendants conspired to traffic in drugs and plot assassinations in
Central America and elsewhere. The defendants have denied the
charges.
   The lawsuit, filed in May 1986, several months before the
Iran-Contra affair was exposed publicly, names some of the people
in the private network that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North formed to help
the Nicaraguan Contras, who oppose Nicaragua's leftist government.
   The allegations in the civil lawsuit _ set for trial June 26 in
federal court in Miami _ are broader than the issues raised by
Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra case.
   In the hearing today before U.S. District Judge James King,
Christic attorney Daniel Sheehan said part of their case involved
Bush's directorship of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1976 when
he allegedly allowed covert operations to ``go off the books'' to
prevent them from being ended by the incoming administration of
President Jimmy Carter.
   During a recess, Sheehan told The Associated Press that some of
the defendants in the case ``were running the covert operations for
George Bush.''
   Sheehan said the case was being held up to protect Bush, who is
virtually certain to be the Republican nominee for president this
year.
   Attorneys for some of the defendants were to speak later in the
day.
   The Honey-Avirgan lawsuit claims that ``a secret team'' headed
by former CIA official Theodore Shackley worked over two decades to
manage a covert, shadow government funded with drug profits. There
has never been independent confirmation of the charge.
   Today's hearing involved a series of pretrial motions, including
one by Sheehan to have the judge grant immunity to potential
witnesses who refused to testify for fear of prosecution.
   Attorneys for Avirgan and Honey said they have been unable to
investigate the case because important witnesses, including Jesus
Garcia and Jack Terrell, have been threatened with indictment if
they speak to investigators for Honey and Avirgan.
   Sheehan's assistant Lewis Pitts said a grand jury investigation
in Miami ``was used to silence these little people to interfere
with the investigation.''

   Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, who helped
transform Pittsburgh from a sickly steel town to a vital corporate
center, died today of a rare heart disease after more than a decade
in office. He was 56.
   The popular mayor was stricken at home by a heart attack and
died at 1:36 a.m. in Shadyside Hospital, according to the Allegheny
County Coroner's Office and hospital spokesman Scott Meyers.
   City Council President Sophie Masloff, 70, was sworn in as the
54th mayor of Pittsburgh in the mayor's office about seven hours
after Caliguiri died.
   Masloff, a Democrat and the city's first woman mayor, may serve
as the city's chief executive until Caliguiri's term expires in
January 1990 and will keep her council seat, officials said.
   ``This is such a sad personal occasion for me,'' Masloff said.
``To become mayor as a result of this tragedy causes me great
sorrow. ... Dick Caliguiri brought great dignity to the office of
mayor.''
   Caliguiri, serving his third term as mayor of this city of
400,000, suffered from cardiac amyloidosis, which deposits
dangerous amounts of protein in the heart, kidneys and other major
organs.
   The protein deposits probably stiffened his heart, which
apparently stopped beating while he slept, Dr. Joel Weinberg said
at a news conference.
   Caliguiri, a Democrat, grew up in a working-class neighborhood.
He worked for 15 years in the city parks department, eventually as
a director.
   In 1971, he won a City Council seat as an independent, defeating
endorsed Democratic candidates in this overwhelmingly Democratic
city. As council president in 1977, he took over as interim mayor
when then-Mayor Pete Flaherty joined President Jimmy Carter's
adminstration.
   Caliguiri ra for Flaherty's empty post in November 1977, and was
sworn in April 10, 1977, as the 53rd mayor of Pittsburgh.
   He won re-election twice by landslides during a period in which
the steel industry decayed and the region lost more than 75,000
jobs and had unemployment rates as high as 19 percent.
   Former Mayor David Lawrence initiated a Renaissance I program in
the 1950s to clean up the air and water and refurbish downtown.
Caliguiri, noted for his low-key style and partnerships with the
private sector, felt more was needed to prevent stagnation.
   He launched Renaissance II, an ambitious program to attract more
diverse businesses and industry. At the same time, he pumped
millions of dollars into the city's colorful neighborhoods in an
effort to stop flight to the suburbs.
   He also is credited with keeping the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball
team in town and helping Pittsburgh earn an award as the nation's
most-livable city.
   Caliguiri became aware he was ill in March 1987 when he became
dizzy while playing golf. However, he said nothing publicly until
Oct. 2, when The Pittsburgh Press confronted him with medical
evidence.
   ``If a conflict should ever arise between my public
responsibilities and my personal health, I will be the first to
know it and the first to act on it,'' he said. ``This city is too
important to me _ I have dedicated my life to it _ to do
otherwise.''
   Two weeks later, Mayor Louis J. Tullio of Erie disclosed he also
suffered from amyloidosis, which usually is found only in men of
Mediterranean descent. It was promptly dubbed by some the ``mayor's
disease.''
   On Dec. 24, surgeons at Shadyside inserted a pacemaker in
Caliguiri's chest to regulate his heartbeat. Earlier this week, Dr.
James O'Toole, Caliguiri's cardiologist, said he was evaluating the
possibility of a heart transplant.
   One of Caliguiri's last public appearances was at the start of
the Pittsburgh Marathon on Sunday.
   In addition to his wife, Jeanne, Caliguiri is survived by two
sons, Gregg and David.

<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists on Friday
vowed to avenge the ``premeditated butchery'' of 19 kidnappers
killed during a dramatic rescue of 23 French lawmen. Police and
army personnel were put on full alert.
   The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the main
Melanesian separatist group, called for Saturday to be a ``day of
active mourning of the same level as the massacre on Ouvea'' and
urged work stoppages and barricades to be set up in the streets.
   French police said the bodies of three more kidnappers were
found on the island of Ouvea. They also said the presumed chief of
the captors, Alphonse Dianou, died of wounds inflicted during
Thursday's assault.
   His death and the discovery of the three bodies brought the
death toll among the kidnappers to 19. Two members of a French
assault team also died. Five people were injured.
   This French Pacific territory appeared calm Friday after troops
stormed the secluded cave on Ouvea and freed the hostages.
   Bernard Pons, France's minister for overseas territories, said
the 7,000 army and gendarmerie personnel on New Caledonia were
placed on a state of ``absolute alert.''
   Pons said ``terrorists ... will find themselves in front of
entirely determined men.'' He did not elaborate.
   The rescue team pelted the cave with tear gas canisters during
the nearly seven-hour battle on Ouvea, which is in the Loyalty
island group. The hostages freed themselves from their manacles
with a key that had been smuggled in by a hostage who was being
used as a go-between with French authorties.
   Melanesians make up 36 percent of the territory's 145,000
people, while European settlers comprise about 43 percent. The rest
are Asian or Polynesian.
   The Melanesian front is seeking independence from France, which
has ruled New Caledonia since 1853.
   The kidnappings began on April 22 during a wave of violence by
Melanesians protesting the first phase of the French presidential
elections on April 24. A group of separatists stormed a police
station, killed four gendarmes and seized several others.
   On April 27, eight other lawmen were seized when they tried to
negotiate the release of the other hostages.
   Both Pons and conservative Premier Jacques Chirac have referred
to the main separatist organization as a ``terrorist group.'' Pons
has asked that it be outlawed, a position Chirac supports.
   In an interview published Friday in several French newspapers,
Chirac said that ``after the failure of the terrorists ... it is
possible to build a fraternal Caledonia ... where no one feels
excluded.''
   Chirac and Socialist President Francois Mitterrand are vying for
the presidency in elections on Sunday, and their positions on New
Caledonia differ.
   Chirac takes a hard line, while Mitterrand favors mediation
between the European settlers and the native Melanesians, who have
become a minority in their own land since France colonized it in
1853.

   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday it is ``admirable and courageous'' of his old boss, Vice
President George Bush, to refrain from making recommendations to
President Reagan during Cabinet meetings.
   Fitzwater, who was Bush's press secretary before becoming the
chief White House spokesman last year, was asked about statements
the vice president made during a presidential campaign swing
through Western states.
   Bush, speaking to reporters during a campaign stop in Sacramento
on Wednesday, said ``kiss and tell'' books about the administration
are partly to blame for his reluctance to speak up more in meetings.
   The vice president also said, ``I hold back speaking in meetings
because I don't want the president to have to be choosing between
his vice president and the other members of the Cabinet.''
   Fitzwater said, ``The vice president has taken that position
since day one, that he is a private adviser to the president. He
reserves his recommendations and confidence for the president and
often doesn't voice his feelings in meetings for that very reason,
that they will be leaked or go to the press, or that various people
will try to use his (positions) to take sides to the president.''
   ``He has defined an appropriate position for the vice president
that I find admirable and courageous in view of the heavy pressures
that are continually put on him to talk,'' Fitzwater said. ``He has
for the first time in history defined the vice presidency in a way
that is meaningful to the president and has made it the
confidential adviser that I think is very important; and I suspect
future vice presidents will want to follow that mold.''
   Fitzwater also said that the president will soon endorse Bush,
who has amassed more than the number of delegates needed for the
Republican presidential nomination, ``at an appropriate ceremony
and function ... probably with very high visibility.''
   He said the White House was not ready to announce when this will
be. The president will speak at a fund-raising dinner for
Republican congressional candidates on Wednesday. Fitzwater said
Bush was expected to attend.

   Pro-life demonstrators ended a week of protests
at abortion clinics today by trying to block a Manhattan doctor's
office, and 316 people were arrested, police said.
   Hundreds of protesters turned out at Dr. Herbert Schwarz's
office despite a temporary restraining order prohibiting members of
Operation Rescue from blocking abortion clinic entrances.
   During the week police made nearly 1,650 arrests. Most of the
same people were arrested each day. The demonstrations were held in
Manhattan, Queens and Hicksville, on Long Island.
   ``In evaluating our week, we are tremendously pleased with the
results,'' Operation Rescue spokesman Lowell Patterson said.
``Three out of the four days we managed to keep the doors to the
facilities closed.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward had issued the restraining
order Wednesday at the request of abortion rights groups and the
city, which complained the protests had cost more than $250,000 in
police overtime.
   Ward threatened $25,000-a-day fines that would be turned over to
the National Organization for Women under the order that remains in
effect until Saturday.
   Patterson said Operation Rescue, with participants from 20
states including several from Alaska, planned to appeal the order.
   Corporation Counsel attorney Lorna Bade Goodman said the city
planned to seek contempt charges since ``they were clearly in
violation of that order today.''
   The demonstrators arrived outside the Manhattan clinic, the same
one where the protests began, and began their daily prayer session
in a steady rain. Police moved in quickly, arresting all 316
demonstrators by 9:20 a.m., said Officer Janice Swinney, a police
spokesman.
   They were all charged with disorderly conduct and released,
Swinney said.
   Patterson said no further demonstrations were planned.

<TEXT>
   President Najib of Afghanistan said
Friday his army would deal ``a heavy and severe blow'' to Moslem
guerrillas if they keep fighting his government but said his offer
of a political role for the guerrillas stands.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas, whose headquarters are in Pakistan,
have refused to participate in any government headed by Najib. In a
statement issued Friday in New Delhi, they attacked ``India's
misconceived policy of taking (the) side of (the) criminal regime
of Kabul.''
   The Afghan president met Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and several
top government officials during his three-day stay in New Delhi and
then held a press conference.
   Najib said India and Afghanistan, whose mutual antagonist is
Pakistan, achieved new levels of cooperation during his visit.
   The Indian government announced that India has agreed to supply
Afghanistan with 2,000 tons of tea over a four-year period. Joint
ventures and an Indian role in reconstruction projects were also
discussed, but no details were given.
   Najib also told reporters he had rejected a petition by foreign
journalists to free an Italian journalist and a French photographer
jailed in Afghanistan on espionage charges.
   When asked about the fate of the two journalists, Najib, former
head of Afghanistan's KBG-style secret police, said, ``Both
participated in the war conflicts and illegally entered
Afghanistan. They resorted to subversive activities.''
   Fausto Biloslavo, an Italian who worked for the small Albatross
News Agency, was captured in July 1987, convicted in March of
spying and sentenced to seven years in prison.
   Alain Guillo, a French free-lancer who often worked for the
Sygma photo agency, was captured in March 1987, convicted Jan. 4 of
spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Both men were captured after entering the country with the
guerrillas, who have been fighting nearly 10 years to oust Najib's
Soviet-backed government.
   Friday's news conference was a reflection of Najib's increased
availability to non-Soviet bloc reporters and coincides with
Moscow's preparations to start withdrawing its estimated 115,000
soldiers from Afghanistan.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up a
socialist government against attacks by Islamic guerrillas. The
Soviet withdrawal is scheduled to begin May 15 under an agreement
signed in Geneva on May 14 by the Soviet Union, the United States,
Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   Najib said the guerrillas ``are actually doing a political
suicide'' by refusing to talk with his government.
   He reiterated that the deposed Afghan king, Zahir Shah, was free
to return home to participate in politics.
   Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973 by a cousin who in turn was
assassinated in 1978. Afghan refugees and some Western officials
have suggested that Zahir Shah's return from his exile in Rome
might pave the way for a transition of government.
   An Indian official, speaking after Najib's news conference, said
India had played an informal role in discussing the Afghan problems
with the deposed king, as well as with the United States, the
Soviet Union and Pakistan. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Najib flew home to Afghanistan shortly after the news conference.

<HEAD>Medicare, Social Security Funds Building Fatter Reserves Than
Expected</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare's fortunes have improved and its
trust fund now is not likely to run out of cash until the year
2005, while the Social Security old age fund should be solvent
until the middle of the 21st century, the systems' trustees told
Congress on Friday.
   The 2005 date is three years later than was forecast a year ago.
   The trustees, including three Reagan Cabinet members, said
Social Security's old age fund also had achieved robust gains and
predicted it ``will have enough funds to cover expenditures for
about 60 years into the future.''
   The board said Medicare's trust fund grew by nearly $14 billion
in calendar 1987 and finished the year with reserves of $53.7
billion.
   Assuming moderate economic conditions, the hospital insurance
reserves were forecast to grow to nearly $153 billion over the next
decade before dwindling to nothing in the year 2005.
   The trustees urged Congress to ``take early remedial measures to
bring future (Medicare) costs and finance into balance'' and to
``avoid the need for later, potentially precipitous changes.''
   They said the shortfall could be covered by a 14 percent cut in
benefits, a 16 percent increase in the Medicare tax or a
combination of both.
   In the early 1980s, the trustees warned Medicare's trust fund
would go bankrupt in the 1990s. Its financial picture has improved
partly as a result of federal constraints on hospital payments.
   The Medicare program provides hospital insurance for 28 million
Americans 65 or older and 3 million disabled workers under 65. The
program took in $64.1 billion in payroll taxes and other income in
1987, and paid out $50.3 billion.
   The Social Security old age fund, on the verge of bankruptcy
just a few years ago, experienced even more robust growth. It grew
by $23 billion in 1987, ``reflecting the continuing growth in the
economy,'' the trustees said, and finished the year with $62.1
billion in reserves.
   The old age program had income of $210.7 billion and
disbursements of $187.7 billion in 1987.
   The disability fund took in $20.3 billion, but paid out $21.4
billion, and finished 1987 with $6.7 billion in reserve.
   The old age and disability programs pay benefits to 38 million
retirees and disabled workers.
   The trustees said the $1.1 billion drop in the disability
reserve was due to a growing number of people awarded disability
benefits.
   The trustees said they expected the number of AIDS victims
drawing disability to grow rapidly through 1991.
   But so far, they said, ``Due to the extremely high mortality
rates ... the total number of disabled workers currently receiving
benefits has not increased greatly as a result of AIDS.''
   The combined old age and disability funds, now equal to about
three months' benefit payments, are expected to bulge rapidly over
the next 27 years, peaking at more than $12 trillion _ $2 trillion
in today's dollars _ in 2015. That would be enough to pay benefits
for more than five years.
   The old age and disability funds are expected to grow by $40
billion this year, $46 billion in 1989 and $75 billion in 1992.
   The trustees said the next Social Security Advisory Council
should examine what ``the proper level of fund accumulation should
be.'' Some politicians, including Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., have
called for lowering the payroll tax instead of building up a huge
reserve.
   Otis R. Bowen, the secretary of health and human services, said,
``Those reserves will be needed to meet the financial obligations
of the program in the next century when the young workers of today
become eligibile for Social Security.''
   The plan is to dig into that reserve after 2015 to help pay
retirement for the so-called Baby Boom generation ``until the funds
are exhausted in 2048,'' the trustees said.
   Then the system would need to raise taxes or lower benefits to
stay on an even keel. The actuarial deficit over 75 years is just
0.58 percent of taxable payroll _ the equivalent of a 0.29 percent
increase in the payroll tax on workers and employers.
   In 1960 there were 5.1 workers paying taxes for each
beneficiary; today there are 3.4 workers per beneficiary. The
trustees said the ratio will fall gradually to 3-to-1 by the year
2010 and then 2-to-1 by the year 2030.
   They predicted a 3.8 percent benefit increase next January, with
increases of 4 percent-plus over the next five years.
   They also forecast that the maximum amount of wages subject to
the Social Security and Medicare tax _ now $45,000 _ will rise to
$46,500 in 1989, $48,600 in 1990 and $57,000 in 1993. The tax
climbs from 7.51 percent to 7.65 percent in 1990.
   The trustees also forecast scenarios under optimistic and
pessimistic economic and demographic conditions. Their estimate of
moderate conditions, however, is the one usually relied on by
Congress.
   This middle-range forecast assumes long-range growth of 1.4
percent a year in real wages, inflation of 4 percent, interest
rates of 6 percent and unemployment at 6 percent.
   The trustees' report to Congress was five weeks overdue.
   James A. Baker III, the secretary of the treasury, is the
managing trustee. The others are Bowen; Secretary of Labor Ann
McLaughlin; and two from the private sector, Mary Falvey Fuller and
Suzanne Denbo Jaffe.

<TEXT>
   Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital have
used a sophisticated computer program to enhance images of a
2,500-year-old mummy in three dimensions, said a radiology
professor.
   Dr. Elliot Fishman, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine associate
professor of radiology, and his staff used the process Thursday to
take nearly 500 cross-sectional images of the mummy using a modern
CT scanner, a device that takes thin cross-sectional X-ray images
of the body from 360 degrees.
   Computerized tomography was previously used on mummies by a team
from Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston.
   The mummy of a petite woman was originally brought to the United
States in the 1870s by the Rev. John Franklin Goucher, for whom
Goucher College in Baltimore is named.
   ``We're excited about learning more,'' said Dr. Betsy Bryan,
professor of Near Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University. ``I
guess she's taken on a personality for us. She's become a real
person.
   ``And by using X-rays and the CT scanner we can leave her
intact. We'll still have a very well-preserved mummy.''
   X-rays already taken at the hospital this year revealed that the
mummy was female and a mother, about 50 years old when she died,
weighed 105 pounds and had good hipbones and teeth, except for a
missing molar and an impacted wisdom tooth.
   Early results of the CT scan showed two packages in the mummy's
chest and an unexplained hole in her head, Dr. Fishman said.
   The mummification process, first practiced as early as 3,000
B.C., had evolved by the time the woman died, around 500 B.C. of
unknown causes, into a complicated ritual lasting more than two
months, Dr. Bryan said.
   The brain was removed through the nostrils to keep the head
intact. Internal organs were removed, with the heart often returned
to the chest cavity, after preserving with a salt known as natron.
The remains were wrapped in linen, coated with resin and placed in
a coffin for burial.
   The Johns Hopkins mummy was not of royal birth, so burial in a
pyramid was out of the question, said Dr. Bryan. ``She was probably
middle-class, buried in a wooden sarcophagus in the desert.''
   There was some damage from grave robbers. Her tightly crossed
arms and wrists once wore bracelets and the robbers slashed her
chest in removing the jewelry, Dr. Bryan said.
   But ``her skin is still there, her hair and everything,'' said
Dr. Giraud Foster, an associate profesor of obstetrics and
gynecology at the JHU medical school. ``We're amazed at how well
she is (preserved).''

<TEXT>
   A national newspaper on Friday blamed poor
sanitation and incest in the Central Asian republics for a high
Soviet infant mortality rate.
   The labor newspaper Trud said the national average for infant
mortality is 25 deaths per 1,000 live births but that the rate went
as high as 70 per 1,000 in some areas of Central Asia.
   The U.S. rate is 10 infant deaths per 1,000 births, according to
1987 figures.
   Women in the Central Asian republics often take their family's
drinking water from irrigation ditches, the newspaper said. This
leads to intestinal infections, cited as the cause of many of the
infant deaths, Trud said.
   Some hospitals in the region lack indoor plumbing and running
water, the report said, and many women in Central Asia have their
children one after another, which can weaken their bodies and
produce weak and undernourished offspring.
   The tendency of some Central Asian ethnic groups to intermarry
also was blamed for raising the infant mortality rate.
   An article in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda last month said
incest was the major factor in the Soviet Union's high infant death
rate.
   In contrast, Trud said, the 11 per 1,000 infant mortality rate
in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia is equal
to or lower than that of the United States and West European
nations.
   Trud said improved living conditions and sex education in
underdeveloped areas of Central Asia were needed to rectify the
infant mortality problem.

   A British military helicopter
crashed and burst into flames at an international air show today,
killing at least two people and injuring several others, officials
said.
   Airport officials in Hanover said the crash occurred as the
helicopter returned from a short demonstration flight. They said
the helicopter hit a loading ramp at the airport with its back
rotor.
   In early reports, eyewitnesses said the helicopter belonged to
the U.S. military, but airport officials later said the aircraft
was a U.S.-made Chinook helicopter flown by the British.
   The accident occurred at about 6 p.m. (12 noon EDT) shortly
after the end of the air show, officials said.
   It was not immediately known whether the dead were members of
the crew or whether there were fatalities on the ground.
   Fire and emergency crews raced to the scene after the crash,
pouring foam on the burning wreckage.

   An earthquake sent frightened
residents into the streets today, and state-run radio said some
buildings were damaged in the southern town of Rivas.
   Radio broadcasts called on the public to remain calm.
   The quake at 8:46 a.m. (10:46 a.m. EDT) measured 5.7 on the
Richter scale, said John Minsch, a geophysicist with the U.S.
Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center at
Golden, Colo.
   The quake was centered near the west coast of Nicaragua about 80
miles south of Managua, he said.
   Most workers and residents returned to their jobs or daily
routines within minutes of the tremor. Some Managua residents said
they felt two tremors, but there were no immediate reports of
damage or injury in the capital.
   Radio Sandino said some homes suffered damages in Rivas, 70
miles south of Managua.
   Managua was devastated by an earthquake in December 1972 that
killed at least 10,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas, and a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage
in populated areas.

<HEAD>Seven Democrats, Two Republicans Fighting For Governorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Gov. Arch Moore has battled
back into the lead against a millionaire primary challenger who
seeks to deny him a shot at a fourth term as leader of this
financially troubled state.
   Seven Democrats are seeking their party's nomination for
governor in Tuesday's election, with polls showing the two
front-runners too close to call in an increasingly strident race.
   Moore's opponent is Morgantown businessman John Raese, a coal,
steel and media company owner who narrowly lost to then-Gov. Jay
Rockefeller in the 1984 U.S. Senate election.
   He has accused Moore of waging a ``rose garden'' campaign,
refusing to debate him and relying on his status as governor to
carry him through the election.
   Moore, 65, claims to have cut taxes by $311 million in the past
four years, although he fought most of the cuts when they were
imposed by the Legislature.
   He also cites his accomplishments at bringing news businesses
and bringing 30,000 jobs to the state, although the total number of
employed West Virginians has increased by just 5,700 since Moore
took office in 1985.
   Moore insists that the state is making an economic recovery, but
Raese and the Democrats say otherwise. Mario Palumbo, a state
senator from Charleston, says the state will face a $400 million
deficit when the fiscal year ends June 30 and should declare
bankruptcy. Raese says Moore has made just 10 percent of $385
million in budget cuts recommended by the Governor's Task Force on
Waste Management.
   The 38-year-old Raese, who inherited much of his wealth, has
gained a reputation of a ``rich kid'' who loves fast boats and hard
living. At a Dallas hotel in 1984, while attending the Republican
National Convention, Raese grabbed a newspaper reporter by the
lapels and proclaimed ``I buy and sell reporters like you every
day.''
   Earlier this week, Raese's wife, Liz, called her husband ``a
man's man'' and said he is not the ``party animal'' many people
believe him to be.
   ``Sure, John loves fast cars and fast boats. When he gets
stressed out, that's his release,'' she said. ``In fact, we have
our best love affairs in the middle of the ocean. There is solitude
out there. You're alone.''
   When Republicans were surveyed April 13-18 for the West Virginia
Poll, Raese had a 54 percent to 30 percent lead. But Moore had not
yet begun his television and newspaper advertising, and in the past
two weeks he has been on the road campaigning almost constantly,
promising state money for various projects and announcing plant
openings in Elkins and South Charleston.
   In a new poll conducted Monday through Wednesday, Moore was
favored 48 percent to 35 percent. The copyright poll, conducted for
The Associated Press, Charleston Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV by
Ryan-Samples Research Inc., is based on telephone interviews
conducted with 306 registered Democrats and 275 registered
Republicans and independents selected at random. It had a margin of
error of 5.6 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Clyde See, 46, and Gaston Caperton, 48,
have waged an expensive battle of television commercials accusing
each other of various misdeeds.
   See, a former House of Delegates speaker and the party's 1984
nominee for governor, has ridiculed Caperton's business practices
and his refusal to sign a voluntary campaign spending limit.
   See's ads point out that a study found a 25 percent error rate
in state claims processed by Caperton's insurance company,
McDonough Caperton Insurance Group of Charleston. The company
handles the state employee insurance system.
   Caperton has responded by saying he built the nation's 18th
largest insurance company and accused See of engaging in
``old-style politics'' and a dirty campaign full of ``distortion.''
   In the latest West Virginia Poll, among Democrats surveyed,
Caperton was named by 30 percent, while See was picked by 29
percent, with the rest divided among the five other candidates or
undecided.
   Caperton has also come under fire for his heavy spending. In a
statement filed with the secretary of state on Wednesday, he listed
$1.8 million in campaign expenses _ more than three times that of
any other candidate.
   ``I have had to use TV because I came into the race relatively
unknown,'' said Caperton, making his first try for public office.
``The criticism from the other candidates is nothing more than a
show of frustration and desperation.''

   Convicted child-killer Arthur Gary Bishop,
having fired his attorneys and abandoned appeals of his death
sentence, expressed sorrow for his crimes Friday as a judge
scheduled his execution June 10.
   Third District Judge Frank G. Noel signed the death warrant
after Bishop read a brief statement explaining why he had decided
to forego appeals of his convictions for the sex-related abductions
and slayings of five boys from 1979 to 1983.
   ``In reflecting back on my life, I remember a lot of good
things, but these are overshadowed by the things I have done,''
Bishop said. ``I wish I could make restitution somehow, but I don't
see how I can.''
   Bishop, 38, was allowed to fire his attorneys and drop appeals
last month after he was found competent to decide his fate.
   Bishop, his hands shackled in front of him as he stood to read
his hand-written statement, said his apology to his victims'
families following his 1984 conviction may not have been as sincere
as it should have been.
   Near the conclusion of the 10-minute hearing, he said he was
restating his apology with ``heartfelt empathy. ... Again, I say I
am truly sorry for all the anguish.''
   ``I wish I could go back and change what happened, or that by
giving my life these five innocent lives could be restored,'' said
Bishop, his voice low but steady.
   Utah law provides for execution by lethal injection or firing
squad. Bishop previously had indicated he preferred lethal
injection.
   Bishop was convicted on five counts of first-degree murder, five
counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count of sexual abuse of a
minor following a six-week trial in 1984.
   In a confession to police, Bishop said he killed the boys, ages
4 to 13, to prevent exposure as a child molester.
   On Monday, the Utah Supreme Court lifted Bishop's stay of
execution and remanded the case to district court for the setting
of the execution date.
   Should Bishop change his mind about seeking execution, any
federal appeals must be filed by late May, three months after the
Utah Supreme Court's Feb. 29 denial of a petition for rehearing
filed by Bishop's former attorneys.

   The beatification of Father Junipero Serra
means the Roman Catholic church is finally coming to appreciate
U.S. history, says a diocesan spokesman, but his detractors blame
the founder of the mission system for helping destroy Indian
culture.
   The Vatican will beatify Serra, an 18th-century priest and one
of the first Europeans in California, on Sept. 25. Beatification is
one step from sainthood, and many in the church here hope it will
lead to sainthood for Serra.
   A contingent of Roman Catholic bishops from California plans to
travel to Rome for the ceremony.
   ``The church has finally caught up to U.S. history,'' said Ted
Elisee, spokesman for the Diocese of Monterey, where Serra is
buried at the Carmel Mission Basilica.
   ``He has been called California's first citizen. He was a great
historical figure in the U.S., and the church is catching up with
him,'' said Elisee. ``For those who are devoted to him, this is an
affirmation and a confirmation of their belief. For them, this is a
great moment.''
   Serra, a Franciscan born on the island of Majorca, established
the first of nine missions in San Diego in 1769. Altogether, 21
missions were created by his order from San Diego to Sonoma.
   When the pope visited the United States last year, he stopped at
Serra's grave and lauded his work.
   Serra's remains were exhumed in 1943 for archaeological and
canonical purposes, then reburied in the middle vault in a copper
coffin with an air-tight glass inner lid. The coffin was sealed
with brass wire, then marked with images of the Virgin Mary and
with crosses.
   In May 1985, Serra was declared venerable by the church. Once
Roman Catholic authorities agreed that Serra had accomplished one
miracle, beatification was in line. If a second miracle can be
confirmed, Serra can be declared a saint.
   The first miracle involved the recovery of Franciscan Sister
Boniface Dyrda, now 71 and living in St. Louis, who was diagnosed
as fatally ill in 1960. She recovered from what was found to be
lupus, tuberculosis of the skin, after she and her order prayed to
Serra, Elisee said.
   Indian groups have opposed honors for Serra, who they say
subjected Indian converts to corporal punishment and forcibly kept
them inside the missions, where they were separated by sex and
required to do farming and construction tasks.
   His actions, including stealing Indian lands and exposing
Indians to European diseases for which they had no resistance,
helped destroy Indian culture, the critics say.

   Carnations, roses and memories will fill a
chapel when sons and daughters gather to honor their mothers
Sunday, 80 years after the nation's first Mother's Day service was
celebrated here.
   ``We expect to have a full house. We usually do,'' said Lenore
Shafer, a tour guide at the Mother's Day Shrine. ``I think
everybody has a feeling for their mother.
   ``Everybody doesn't have children, but everybody has a mother.''
   Tourists from all 50 states, England, Canada and even Japan have
visited the shrine, located in a former Methodist church built in
1872, Shafer said.
   ``Some like the hard-carved pews, others come to see our stained
glass windows and murals,'' said Betty Hayhurst, chairwoman of the
committee that oversees the shrine. ``A lot of young people come
here too. It's not just old people.''
   Anna Jarvis, the founder of national Mother's Day, spelled out
its purpose in a letter to organizers 80 years ago: ``To revive the
dormant love and filial gratitude we owe to those who gave us
birth. ... To brighten the lives of good mothers. To have them know
we appreciate them, though we do not often show it as we might.''
   The first Mother's Day celebration on May 10, 1908, at Andrews
Methodist Church in Grafton, and another at Wanamaker's Auditorium
in Philadelphia that afternoon, marked the death of Miss Jarvis'
mother, Anna Maria Jarvis, three years earlier.
   Back in the 1850s, when the area around Grafton was still part
of Virginia, Mrs. Jarvis had been spurred to work against
unsanitary living conditions in the region by the deaths of eight
of her 12 children before they reached adulthood.
   Her ``Mother's Day Work Clubs'' in Grafton and nearby towns were
so successful that doctors urged others to follow her example. The
clubs also won praise for easing hostility among neighbors during
the Civil War, when the slavery issue divided families and
ultimately divided Virginia itself.
   Throughout the last years of her life, Mrs. Jarvis shared her
dream of a day set aside for the mothers of the world _ living and
dead _ with Anna.
   But she did not live long enough to see her dream come true.
   According to the book ``Mother's Day and the Mother's Day
Church,'' Anna, then a 41-year-old spinster, vowed to herself to
establish Mother's Day as her mother's casket was being lowered
into her grave at West Chester, Pa.
   The idea soon became an obsession as Miss Jarvis worked to
promote the day with personal appearances and letter-writing
campaigns.
   She finally persuaded John Wanamaker, a Philadelphia merchant
and philanthropist, to support her in her quest. Wanamaker later
became part of a committee, along with food manufacturer H.J.
Heinz, that mapped out a program to extend Mother's Day around the
world.
   After the first celebration in 1908, the idea caught on quickly,
and by the following year Mother's Day was observed in at least one
town in nearly all the states, as well as Puerto Rico, Canada and
Mexico.
   A year later, Gov. William E. Glasscock proclaimed the second
Sunday in May as Mother's Day in West Virginia, and in 1914,
President Woodrow Wilson did the same for the whole country.
   Flowers have been part of Mother's Day since Miss Jarvis sent
500 white carnations, chosen to represent purity, to Grafton for
the first celebration. Participants were urged to wear a red
carnation if their mother was living, and white if their mother was
dead.
   ``It is definitely the biggest holiday of the year for us,''
said Rocky Pollitz, vice president of industry relations for
Teleflora, the nation's largest independently owned floral company.
   ``People may not think of sending flowers all year, but on
Mother's Day, everybody thinks of flowers.''
   Many, whose mothers have died, send flowers to the shrine,
Hayhurst said. The flowers are taken to nursing homes and hospitals
following the Mother's Day service.

   Oh no! Has Alice's Restaurant gone
yuppie?
   Well, the restaurant Arlo Guthrie made famous in his talking
anti-war song ``Alice's Restaurant'' has been reborn as a fancy
delicatessen, and it does feature such fare as red potatoes stuffed
with caviar.
   But Joey Wheaton and Bernie Mallon bristled Friday at the
suggestion that their restaurant seemed to be a yuppie version of
the eating spot that had been a symbol of the hippie days of the
1960s.
   ``We haven't made that much money yet,'' said Wheaton. ``We're
still driving a secondhand station wagon.''
   They said that since they opened La Fete Chez Vous last month
there have been only a few visits by people in search of the folksy
spot Alice Brock ran in the 1960s.
   ``Some people will ask `Didn't Alice's Restaurant used to be in
Stockbridge,' and we'll tell them, `You're sitting in it,''' said

<HEAD>Arab-American Resistance Leader Ordered Deported</HEAD>

   The government Friday ordered an Arab-American
leader of Palestinian resistance to leave the country and accused
him of ``preaching violence.'' The United States and left-wing
Israelis sought to prevent the deportation.
   The move to deport 44-year-old Mubarak Awad was the latest
Israeli action aimed at breaking the back of Palestinian resistance
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. That resistance has been
built on strikes and other protest techniques Awad advocated.
   The United States asked Israel to delay Awad's deportation while
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering met with Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres and asked Israel to reconsider the order, Israel television
reported.
   In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops blocked all commerce
for the second straight day. The soldiers shut down shops and gas
stations, halted transit and even chased away street vendors.
   The government has been trying to force merchants to open and
close on Israeli orders _ not at the dictates of uprising leaders _
and troops have threatened to weld shut the doors of shops whose
merchants disobey soldiers' orders.
   Authorities arrested an American-born Jewish settler in the
fatal shooting of a Palestinian shepherd. Israel radio said police
would recommend charging the settler, Yisrael Zeev, with murder.
   Zeev allegedly shot the Arab in the head Thursday when he
refused to move his flock from near the Shiloh Jewish settlement
near Ramallah, and some shepherds threw rocks at Shiloh guards,
according to Palestinian reports and the radio.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded
three Arab protesters in Gaza City, Shifa Hospital officials said.
One of the victims was a 12-year-old boy.
   Awad, who runs the Center for Non-Violent Studies in Jerusalem,
was presented with a deportation order before dawn after being
arrested at his Jerusalem home. Awad's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab,
said his client probably would appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Leaders of the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip have adopted many of Awad's strategies of peaceful
resistance, including commercial strikes, nonpayment of taxes,
boycotting Israeli products and sit-in demonstrations against the
occupation.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Awad was ordered deported because he had gone beyond calls for
non-violent protest and was responsible for leaflets that urged
Palestinians to throw gasoline bombs and rocks.
   ``This is preaching violence,'' Pazner said, adding that Awad
had also called for a Palestinian state that would include all of
Israel. Shamir, who also heads the Interior Ministry, signed the
deportation order.
   In a statement delivered Friday by attorney Kuttab, Awad said he
supported the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
   ``I also believe the Palestinians can get their rights through
non-violence and a campaign of civil disobedience. This has been
the message of the uprising.... It is a much better way than our
attempting to kill one another,'' the statement said.
   According to U.N. figures, 184 Palestinians have been killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli
teen-ager have died.
   Kuttab, who met with Awad in jail, said his client was somber.
   ``They are trying to cut all his ties with his own country. It
is very serious,'' he said.
   The Jerusalem-born Awad, who also has a home in Wapakoneta,
Ohio, was in Israel on a tourist visa that expired last November,
and he refused an order to leave the country. Awad was allowed to
remain following strong U.S. pressure.
   Friday's deportation order elicited protests from some left-wing
Israelis.
   In a telegram to Shamir, legislator Yossi Sarid said: ``You can
deport Awad but not his positions, which are those of a moderate
Palestinian. If (Israel) can't talk to Awad, then we really only
know how to shoot.''
   A group of American Jews living in Israel met with U.S.
Consul-General Philip Wilcox to urge American action against the
deportation. ``We protest the discriminatory treatment that Israel
metes out to American citizens depending on whether they are Jewish
or Arab,'' said John Ostfild of Minneapolis.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Dan Shomron said he believed the measures to
choke off the Palestinian uprising had succeeded in ``starting a
process of disillusionment.''
   ``The (Arabs) now understand they cannot achieve their aims
and...their suffering is for nothing,'' Shomron told the daily
Yediot Ahronot.
   The daily Maariv reported about 60,000 European tourists had
canceled plans to travel to Israel because of the unrest. The
newspaper said 407 charter flights scheduled for April through
October had been called off.

<HEAD>Mayor Defends Dog Killings, Says Town Has Serious Stray Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BLACKSHEAR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Harry Adams on Friday defended a
police officer who used a shotgun and nightstick to kill two dogs,
saying the city has a serious problem with stray dogs.
   The town, Adams said, has received angry phone calls and hate
mail over the incident. ``People have looked at one side of the
story.''
   The dogs, frequent companions to a disabled veteran, were shot
by Sgt. James Mock. A witness and the Ofekenofee Humane Society in
nearby Waycross obtained warrants from a probate judge charging
Mock with cruelty to animals. He is free on $500 bond.
   Adams said the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, asked to
investigate, had decided no crime was committed.
   The town, he said, has bought a tranquilizer gun, and police
will be taught to use it.
   ``We love animals as much as anyone else,'' the mayor said.
``We're not out to kill dogs ... only eliminate dogs that we
consider dangerous to human life.''
   Adams also disputed claims by Harriett Dixon, director of the
humane society, that up to eight dogs may have died in the April 29
incident.
   ``To set the record straight, only two dogs were killed,'' he
said. ``Three shots were fired, one or more of which killed one dog
and critically wounded the other. The officer took his baton and
finished killing the second dog.''
   Since the humane society became involved, Ms. Dixon said, she
has received telephone threats to stay out of Blackshear.
   ``This is not the first time this has happened,'' she said.
``Dogs have been shot in front of people's homes. The people
telling me these things are afraid to identify themselves.''
   Adams said 61-year-old Elliott Trueluck had been warned
repeatedly to keep the dogs outside the city, which has a leash
law. Trueluck is well-known in Blackshear because he strolls to a
restaurant just about every morning, followed by a pack of dogs.
   Adams cited an ordinance that gives police the authority to kill
vicious animals; police, he said, had received numerous complaints
about Trueluck's dogs.
   Police Chief Dennis Martin said one of the dogs once tried to
attack a waitress at the restaurant and others had almost caused an
auto accident while fighting in a street in the south Georgia town
of 3,500 people.
   City officials have said Trueluck laughed off the warnings.
   Trueluck said he has been afraid to walk to town since the
shooting.
   ``It scared the I-don't-know-what out of me,'' he said.
   His wife, Myrtice, said he receives a small disability check
every month because he has never recovered from being ``shell
shocked'' in the Pacific during World War II.

<HEAD>Man's Reign as World Champion of Hula-Hooping End of an Era</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds two grafs at end, description of contest</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of the Hula-Hoop, 30 years old
this year, are reviving the yearly contest for a world champion in
twirling the plastic rings.
   The current title holder, Mat Plendl, is stepping down and
probably will judge the next contest, says Jan Frazier, the Los
Angeles publicist for Wham-O, makers of the fabulous 1950s fad.
   The date of the new world-class Hula-Hoop twirl-off hasn't been
announced yet, but Ms. Frazier said it will be sometime later this
year.
   Plendl says the public is still fascinated with Hula-Hoops.
   ``People who were kids and had Hula-Hoops 30 years ago are
getting them for their kids and even grandchildren now,'' said
Plendl, a 26-year-old Southern California resident.
   Ms. Frazier said there hasn't been an international twirl-off
since 1981, when Plendl last won it. The part-time actor held the
title since 1975, when he beat 1 million other contestants
worldwide, Frazier said.
   Plendl, considered the reigning champion for half his life, will
probably judge the next contest, Ms. Frazier said.
   ``These things are a lot of fun, and they get me a lot of good
notice,'' said Plendl, who claims to have kept 62 Hula-Hoops
spinning at once.
   Plendl, who Ms. Frazier says first won a regional Hula-Hoop
contest at age 10, has built a part-time career out of his hooping.
He's appeared on the Tonight Show three times, on the Dolly Parton
Show and on numerous talk shows.
   ``The Hula-Hoop thing has been a real door opener for me _ it's
got me in places I'd never have been otherwise,'' he says.
   Twirl-off contestants are judged on degree of difficulty,
continuity and showmanship. They must do five compulsory stunts,
including the ``knee-knocker'' and the ``stork,'' which even Ms.
Frazier could not describe.
   That is followed by a freestyle competition in which they have
up to two minutes to perform a routine with hoops to music. Plendl
used 10 hoops in his freestyle event.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geomagnetic storm is sweeping over the Earth
and may interfere with satellite, radio and telephone
communications, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
reported Friday.
   The storm, which affects the Earth's magnetic field, struck
Thursday evening and is expected to end by sometime Saturday or
Sunday, said Joe Hirman of the Space Environment Services Center in
Boulder, Colo.
   Hirman said the disturbance originated in a huge flare that
erupted from the sun on Wednesday.
   It took about a day for the effects to reach Earth, and those
peaked on Friday, he said.
   Most notable for Americans will be the display of the northern
lights, which is an electrical phenomenon induced by the current
from the sun. Those were visible from Boulder on Thursday night,
Hirman said.
   The lights, known as the aurora borealis, should be visible for
a few nights, although the light of the nearly full moon may
interfere with viewing them.
   Hirman said the electrical current induced by the magnetic storm
may also affect communications moving via satellites and could
cause interference with some radio and telephone communications.
   The worst should be over by Sunday, however, he said. Sunday is
Mother's Day, one of the busiest days of the year for the nation's
telephone companies.
   It may not be possible to communicate with Europe via high
frequency radio channels for a time, Hirman said.

<TEXT>
   King Juan Carlos of Spain became an honorary citizen
of the Eternal City during a majestic ceremony Friday at the city
council chamber overlooking Michelangelo's Capitoline Square.
   President Francesco Cossiga, members of Spanish royalty and
Italian aristocracy, top government officials, diplomats and red
and purple-robed cardinals and prelates attended the ceremony.
   Nicola Signorello, mayor of Rome, enlarged on the personal ties
that link the city with Juan Carlos, who was born here on Jan. 5,
1938. His grandfather, King Alfonso XIII, had been exiled from
Spain in 1931.
   Signorello said that, among other things, Juan Carlos was being
honored for ``guiding with firmness and far-sightedness the re-born
Spanish democracy towards a future of peace, liberty, prosperity
and social advances.''
   ``Rome gave us the spiritual texture of our society _ law,
language, political and administrative organization and art,'' the
monarch replied in Italian.
   Later, in the courtyard of the Capitoline Museums, the king was
given an award by the Italian Solidarity Center, which works to
rehabilitate drug addicts. The group wanted to spotlight the king's
interest in fighting drug addiction, which Juan Carlos has called a
``de-humanizing culture.''

   As an advocate of non-violence, Mubarak Awad
would seem to be the type of Palestinian leader the Israeli
government could accept.
   But Israel declared the Jerusalem-born American a danger to the
state and ordered him deported. Protests by the United States
halted earlier efforts to deport Awad, who lived 15 years in the
Midwest and holds U.S. citizenship.
   Awad has called for his fellow Arabs to use non-violent means,
rather than stone-throwing or gunfire, to express their longing for
a homeland.
   But Awad's strategy of strikes, boycotts and non-cooperation has
helped fuel the current Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories. He also has made clear that, like armed PLO
guerrillas, he wants an independent Palestine.
   Awad, 44, is founder of the Palestinian Center for the Study of
Non-violence and says his ideas come from the passive resistance of
Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Indian leader known as the Mahatma, or
``great soul.''
   His gentle manner adds to the impression that he is an advocate
of peace. One friend commented that the soft-spoken Awad must have
been very good at what he did for years: counseling juvenile
delinquents in Ohio.
   Awad, for all his advocacy of non-violence, also has not
condemned Palestinian guerrillas. Asked recently about his thoughts
on Palestinian fighters, he replied:
   ``They have the right. If they think they can achieve things
with guns, that is up to them. I cannot achieve things with guns. I
don't think it achieves anything.''
   An Israeli statement accuses Awad of encouraging civil
disobedience, which he has advocated, but also of helping prepare
leaflets that call for violence against Israel.
   Awad's wife, Nancy Nye from Wilmington, Ohio, denies her husband
authored such leaflets and insists he does not want to destroy
Israel. But she added: ``No matter where he is, he will be working
for Palestinian independence.''
   Awad was born in Jerusalem in 1943, before the creation of
Israel.
   Ms. Nye said Awad's father was shot and killed in the 1948
Arab-Israeli war when he left the family home to help a wounded
man. Awad was brought up by his mother, a nurse.
   A year after Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East War, Awad went to the United States to study and
received a master's degree from Saint Francis College in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
   He settled in Wapakoneta, Ohio, became a youth counselor and
founded a string of counseling services. He has two children by a
previous marriage, who live in Bluffton, Ohio.
   Awad began returning to Jerusalem on visits in 1983 and two
years later came back for good. His calls for strikes and boycotts
of Israeli goods have caused him regular trouble with authorities.
   He has been arrested at least four times. Last November, Israel
refused to renew his tourist visa and tried to deport him then.
   But after five months of a sustained Arab uprising, Israel
seemed to have no hesitation about expelling the man who says
non-violence is the way to Palestinian independence.

<TEXT>
   A widow says she'll find another way to help
others now that health officials have told her she has to stop
taking homemade soup and sandwiches to homeless people at a park.
   Doraine Frick has been taking food, paid for through donations
of her prayer group and cooked in her own kitchen, to Pioneer Park
in this Phoenix suburb every Wednesday for about two years. But the
meal served Wednesday to about 30 people was the last, she said
Thursday.
   Mrs. Frick, 58, said she won't fight the edict by the Maricopa
County Health Department, adding that she considers it God's
message for her to move on to another ministry.
   ``But this isn't right,'' said Dave Peck, a homeless man who
said he's been hanging around Pioneer Park since 1982. ``These
ladies go out of their way to come down here to feed people that
are living on the streets.''
   Peck said Mrs. Frick and her helper, Lelia Parlier, also have
brought razors, blankets, clothing, toothpaste and toothbrushes to
the park.
   ``They go out of their way,'' he said. ``They'll walk around the
park and ask people if they are hungry.''
   Roy Willis, a Health Department supervisor, said the county had
no choice but to halt Mrs. Frick's operation after a city employee
filed a complaint with the department April 27.
   ``All food must come from an approved source and be prepared in
an approved kitchen,'' Willis said, calling Mrs. Frick's operation
``illegal under any circumstances.''
   ``You just can't prepare food out of your home and take it and
give it away or sell it or whatever to the general public or
anybody else,'' Willis said. ``By law, we have to have control over
how the food is prepared, handled and given away to prevent people
from getting sick.''
   He said the law protects Mrs. Frick, too.
   ``If we get a mass food-borne illness, her liability would be
unbelievable,'' Willis said.
   After a county health officer left a notice at her home to cease
feeding people from food made in her home, Mrs. Frick said, she
went to the park and told the homeless ``we would not be coming
back anymore.''
   Mrs. Frick said she went each Thursday to Hillman Catholic
Renewal Center in Glendale where her prayer group collected money
to buy the food she put into the weekly meals for the poor.
   She said she wanted to use the kitchen at Queen of Peace
Catholic Church, which she attends, but she said it is committed to
the church school's hot lunch program.
   Willis said if the meals were prepared in a church, his
inspectors would examine the kitchen and waive the permit fee.
   If someone doesn't feed the poor, Mrs. Frick said, ``you are
going to find more crime in the city. I feel I've done a lot of
good helping these guys and giving them hope. They know somebody
cares.''

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department has subpoenaed the
records of Sylvester Stallone's production company as part of a
grand jury investigation of the Teamsters union's influence in the
entertainment industry, Daily Variety reported.
   The newspaper's sources said Stallone's White Eagle company was
not the focus of the investigation, but the government is
interested in its relationship with labor and studio consultant
Marty Bacow.
   The Justice Department also was looking into the relationship
between Bacow, the Teamsters and other unidentified Hollywood
production companies, Variety said Thursday.
   ``Let them keep fishing,'' Bacow told Variety. ``I haven't done
anything wrong. Let them do what they want.''
   Stallone attorney Steve Wehner declined to comment.
   Bacow's relationship with Stallone goes back to 1983, when Bacow
served as a consultant for the movie ``Rhinestone.''
   Bacow described Stallone, star of the ``Rambo'' and ``Rocky''
movies, as a ``square guy'' and said it was unfortunate his name
became involved in the investigation.
   ``It should never come to this,'' Bacow said.
   Variety said the Justice Department was trying to determine
whether any of Bacow's relationships might have violated the Hobbs
Act, which makes it illegal for a union representative to demand
something of value in return for labor peace; the Taft-Hartley Act,
which makes it illegal for an employer to give anything of value to
a union leader; or the broader Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   Bacow said he has never acted secretly in his role as a
Hollywood labor consultant.
   ``Anything I've ever done for the studios, they've paid me by
check and I've paid my taxes on it,'' he said. ``I have never been
an official of any union, or a representative of such.''

<HEAD>State Department Says Provisional Government Would Have To Meet
Criteria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any provisional government the Afghan
resistance creates as a rival to the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul
would need to control some territory and meet other criteria to
merit U.S. recognition, the State Department said Friday.
   Such a government also would have to be broadly supported by the
Afghan people and have an ``effective'' structure and the ability
to undertake the valid international obligations of a state, the
department said.
   The statement marked the department's first public discussion of
conditions under which it might recognize a provisional regime.
   The possibility that U.S.-supported guerrillas in Afghanistan
might form such a government has heightened since last month, when
the Soviet Union signed an agreement to withdraw its estimated
115,000 troops from the country within nine months.
   A provisional regime would presumably be a framework for the
government the resistance forces hope to install in Kabul to
replace the weakened, Soviet-back administration of Afghan leader
Najibullah.
   Talk about a provisional government has also been spurred by the
increasing number of predictions inside Afghanistan and by Western
observers that the collapse of the Najibullah government is certain
once the Soviets leave.
   Zalmay Khalilzad, an adviser to Undersecretary of State Michael
Armacost, met with resistance leaders recently and reportedly
outlined the criteria under which a provisional government would be
acceptable to the United States.
   ``The resistance is well aware of our views,'' State Department
spokesman Charles E. Redman said. ``There are a number of important
criteria for any government to have international acceptability.''
   The test is whether a government ``controls territory, has an
effective government structure, possesses the capacity to exercise
the valid international obligations and enjoys broad support,'' he
said.
   Redman cautioned that it would be ``premature'' to disclose
``when or under exactly what conditions we would be prepared to
establish relations with any government in Afghanistan.'' He would
not, for example, define how much territory a government must
control or how strongly its grip must be.
   The United States is ``not involved in any efforts to form a
provisional government with the resistance or anyone else.''
   The first ``essential step'' is for the Soviets to pull their
forces out, which will ``create an evironment more conducive to a
genuine process of self-determination and establish a more broadly
based government,'' Redman said.
   The spokesman belittled the significance of reports by Indian
officials that Najibullah expressed an interest during talks in New
Delhi in sharing power with the guerrilla groups.
   ``It's clear that PDPA, Najibullah's party, lacks popular
support among the Afghan people,'' Redman said. ``He's made these
professions of interest in power-sharing before and his
formulations have always lacked credibility and still do. They've
never addressed the issue of genuine power-sharing but rather
amount to PDPA domination of the government.''
   Since joining the Soviets in signing the Afghan withdrawal
agreement, Secretary of State George P. Shultz has pledged U.S.
support for international programs to resettle millions of refugees
who have fled Afghanistan since the Soviet moved into the country
in force in 1979.
   On Friday, Shultz told an audience of present and former Foreign
Service officers that the ability of the United States to
contribute in a meaningful way could be jeopardized by U.S. budget
austerity.
   ``Where we're going to find funds for that is beyond me,''
Shultz said. ``We're broke. The country's going great, but the
government's broke. And our foreign affairs picture is broke.''

   NASA may almost have been too successful in its

the space shuttle Challenger.
   Shephard became the first to ride a Mercury capsule into space
on May 5, 1961; shortly afterwards President John Kennedy announced
that the nation would attempt to land men on the moon before the
end of the 1960s.
   Shepard followed his 15-minute suborbital trip aboard Freedom 7
by commanding the Apollo 14 mission to the moon in 1971.
   The former astronaut, now a businessman, spoke at a Rotary Club
of Houston luncheon Thursday.
   ``If, 30 years ago, we had said that we were only going to have
two incidents when we had fatalities, all of us would have said, `I
just hope we are that lucky,''' Shepard said. ``The odds were just
not that good 30 years ago.''
   Seven crew members died when Challenger exploded in 1986, and
three astronauts died in a 1967 fire at the Kennedy Space Center
during a training exercise.

   One swimmer drowned and three were hospitalized
after attempting to swim across a 21-mile-wide strait in southern
China, a newspaper reported.
   Thursday's Wen Hui Bao newspaper said Lo Qingshan drowned about
1,000 yards from shore while trying to swim across the Qiongzhou
Strait, between Guangdong province and the island province of
Hainan.
   The report accused organizers of the May 1 athletic event of
negligence. It did not name the organizers.
   The newspaper said the 38 swimmers were not given food or drink
during the 13-hour swim and that many climbed aboard boats halfway
across the strait because of cold and hunger.
   Officials from the provincial sports commission said the event
was held without their approval and that the organizers had no idea
of the dangers involved.

<HEAD>Note Engraver and Painter Dead at 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The painter and engraver William Stanley Hayter,
who taught his innovative printmaking techniques to such renowned
artists as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, is dead at age 86.
   Hayter died of cardiac arrest Wednesday in Paris, where he had
been a leading figure in the art scene since the 1920s.
   The International Herald Tribune said Friday that Hayter was
credited with turning engraving into a lively and experimental form
that attracted many famous artists to his studio in Montparnasse.
   Among those visiting the studio he called Atelier 17 were
Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jackson Pollock, Dali and Picasso.
   Hayter was born in London in 1901 and graduated from Kings
College, London, with honor degrees in art and chemistry. He worked
in Iran from 1922 to 1925 for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., but his
first interest was art.
   ``My father was a painter, and (so were) a lot of people in my
family before, so I was messing about with painting fairly
seriously when I was a child,'' he once said. ``I was painting all
the time when I was in the (Middle) East. I didn't do much with
prints until I came to Paris.''
   He discovered the vanishing art of original printmaking and
revolutionized it with new techniques, including a method of color
printing from a single plate instead of using a separate plate for
each tone.
   Hayter wrote two books that are essential reading for print
makers: ``New Ways of Gravure'' (1949) and ``About Prints'' (1962).
   He lived in Paris from 1926 to 1939, when he moved his studio to
the New School in New York and gave impetus American printmaking.
He returned to Paris in 1950.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procedures for defense examination of
classified documents in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case were
discussed Friday in a closed hearing convened by U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   Gesell convened the hearing to question government security
officials about what he had termed a lack of progress in the
production of classified documents he ruled the defense could
examine.
   But after a lengthy discussion, Gesell reportedly told lawyers
in the case that progress had been made toward eliminating some
procedural obstacles to defense review of the material.
   Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and retired Air Force Maj. Gen.
Richard V. Secord attended the hearing with their attorneys.
   Businessman Albert Hakim, the fourth defendant in the case, did
not attend but was represented by his lawyers.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has collected some 300,000
pages of classified documents, of which he says 50,000 are relevant
to the case. Gesell has ordered that the defense be allowed to
examine all 300,000 pages.
   The judge has said the defendants must be allowed to review the
material with their lawyers, but court security officials have
barred Hakim from seeing the documents because he has never had a
government security clearance.
   The other three defendants all had high-level clearances,
although Secord has been in private business for several years.
   Secord has also encountered procedural obstacles to his
examination of documents, according to court papers filed in the
case.
   Gesell convened the hearing after learning from Walsh earlier
this week that 105,000 pages of classified material had been
deposited in a special secure facility constructed by the Justice
Department for use by the defense lawyers to work with the
documents.
   The four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the
government by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The judge had previously warned that unless the defense gets
access to the material and is able to obtain government
declassification of relevant documents, he might be forced to
dismiss charges in the case.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, secret
documents must be declassified by government agencies before they
can be introduced as evidence.
   In ordering the hearing, Gesell said he was dismayed by ``the
apparent lack of progress being made in declassifying essential
papers.''

   American hostages in Lebanon were brutally
mistreated for trying to escape from their pro-Iranian captors, a
freed French hostage was quoted as saying Friday.
   Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann shared a cell recently with
American Frank Herbert Reed who was ``mistreated to the point of
being left prostrate,'' Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin,
was quoted as saying.
   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when he
was captured Sept. 9, 1986.
   Mrs. Dagin's comments were reported by Agence France-Presse one
day after Kauffmann and two other Frenchmen arrived in Paris
following their release in Lebanon.
   Kauffmann and the other Frenchmen, diplomats Marcel Carton and
Marcel Fontaine, were released from Val-de-Grace military hospital
Friday after receiving medical examinations.
   Kauffmann, in his own interview Friday with the French news
agency, said the remaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``my
main concern. I ask their families to remain patient and stay
confident.'' He was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``War
and Peace'' 21 times during his captivity.
   In a separate statement issued after the dispatch quoting his
sister, Kauffmann said he intended to comment more about the other
hostages next week and did not want anyone relaying his impressions
until then.
   A woman who answered Mrs. Dagin's telephone in Rennes on Friday
said she was out of town and could not be reached.
   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her the
American hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group
Islamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried to
escape.''
   There are 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was captured
March 16, 1985.
   The AFP dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified which
hostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.
   French officials, meanwhile, defended the circumstances under
which the hostages were released. Premier Jacques Chirac condemned
those who ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran.
   ``I say solemnly, I say on my honor, that no negotiation, no
compromise, no bargaining, no deal took place with any foreign
government, or even less with any terrorist group,'' he said.
   Agence France-Presse, citing unidentified sources it said were
close to French negotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resume
formal diplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning the
day the hostages were freed.
   France also has confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billion
loan Iran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports have
said the remainder is to be paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,
Carton and Fontaine.
   The widow of French hostage Michel Seurat said Friday she wanted
an official inquiry into her husband's death. Seurat was kidnapped
with Kauffmann in May 1985 and died in captivity.
   Mary Seurat said Chirac also should demand Seurat's body be
returned to France.
   ``I want his remains so I can bury them, in a country where even
dogs can have gravestones,'' she said.
   In her interview, Mrs. Dagin was quoted as saying that she
learned from her brother that Fontaine was briefly held with Terry
Waite, the special envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury. Waite
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission in Lebanon seeking
the hostages' release.
   She said her brother ``found no excuse for his kidnappers, for
whom he feels only hate.''
   The agency quoted her as saying Kauffmann considered using a
private signal to his son Gregoire _ wiggling his nose _ to
indicate he was lying when making videotapes under coercion in
which he appealed to the French government to do more to win his
freedom.
   He decided not to make the sign ``because he feared the
consequences if it were discovered,'' she quoted im as saying.
   Kauffmann was quoted as saying some of his captors treated him
humanely, but one ``never let up with the humiliations, not to
mention a simulated execution in June 1987 that was particularly
trying.''
   ``When I felt discouraged, I prayed and the next day some little
signs would let me climb back up again,'' he said.

   The presidential task force appointed last
fall to study the October stock market crash says progress toward
reforming the market should not be sidetracked by turf battles
among federal regulators.
   A statement released Thursday by the New York office of Nicholas
F. Brady, a Wall Street investment banker who headed the
presidential panel, said the ``flaws in the mechanisms that govern
our equity markets ... are still in place and must be addressed.''
   The statement said debate over market reform ``has concentrated
on who should oversee the needed changes,'' rather than on what
should be reformed, on which the statement said ``there is much
more agreement.''
   ``Self-interest and turf battles among the regulators and
exchanges cannot be allowed to stand in the way of necessary reform
of a limited number of issues that cut across marketplaces,'' it
said.
   The statement was released three days after Brady met with a
Reagan administration working group which is formulating specific
suggestions for reforming the markets.
   That panel, headed by Treasury Undersecretary George Gould and
comprising the chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board, Securities
and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
is due to report to President Reagan later this month.
   According to sources familiar with the group's work, it is
unlikely to go along with the Brady panel's recommendation that the
Federal Reserve or a coordinating committee of regulators should
get authority to coordinate stock trading and stock index futures
trading.
   Brady is backing legislation sponsored by Senate Banking
Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., which would create a
coordinating body chaired by the head of the Federal Reserve Board.
   The Brady panel's statement warned that ``it would be a mistake
to abandon the development of appropriate legislation.''
   Two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that the working group was making progress toward an
agreement on coordinated ``circuit breakers,'' which would halt
trading when markets take an extreme dive or climb.
   However, the sources said there was less agreement on
coordinating margins, which set the amount of money required to
make an investment in either the futures or stock market. Although
the margins work differently in each market, they currently are
lower in the futures markets.
   The five members of the Brady task force said ``it is essential
to harmonize the level of margins,'' adding that margin setting was
too important to leave to the exchanges.
   The Federal Reserve sets margins for stocks and stock options,
while individual futures exchanges set their own margins.
   ``In the world of one market, it makes little sense to provide
investors with different degrees of leverage depending on whether
they enter through the stock or derivative (futures) door,'' the
panel wrote.
   Regarding circuit breakers, the Brady commission said it was
encouraged by the work of the New York Stock Exchange and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange toward coordinating market halts.
   However, it warned that ``circuit breakers should not be set at
levels that cause them to be triggered frequently.''
   It also criticized a New York Stock Exchange move to restrict
computerized program trading when the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks swings up or down by 50 points.
   That kind of circuit breaker, it said, ``runs the risk of
disconnecting the marketplaces, an outcome we believe would
destabilize the market as a whole.''
   The Brady panel praised the efforts of the exchanges to expand
trading capacity, easing the possibility that extremely high
trading volume would cause a breakdown of the market.
   ``However, let us not fool ourselves. Merely increasing market
capacity will not assure that a repeat of October will be
averted,'' it said.
   In addition to Brady, head of Dillon Read & Co., the panel
members are Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co.;
John Opel, former IBM chairman; James C. Cotting, Navistar
International Corp. chairman; and Howard Stein, Dreyfus Corp.
chairman.

   At 33, Michael P. Fontana was a rising star in a
prestigious law firm, with an impeccable reputation and credentials
to match.
   But 10 years after he was hired, Fontana revealed that he failed
to graduate from law school and never passed the bar examination, a
senior partner with the firm said Friday.
   ``We are just sick about this,'' said Harold Shapiro, an
attorney with Sonnenschein, Carlin, Nath & Rosenthal, which has
about 200 attorneys. ``It's more than difficult, it's
heartbreaking.''
   Fontana was fired immediately after he told the firm the truth;
Shapiro said the law firm had no other choice. ``Somebody who's
been a partner, who turns out not to be a lawyer, cannot be
retained,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``His performance with us was simply first-rate and until his
revelations ... there was not a single instance of unprofessional
conduct known to us. The partners and associates of this firm are
shocked and saddened by this event,'' Shapiro said.
   Fontana, reached at home Friday, said, ``I don't have anything
to say.''
   William J. Harte, Fontana's attorney, said his client was
overwhelmed and declined to discuss the case.
   Fontana started with the firm in 1977 as a summer law clerk at
the end of his second year at the University of Michigan's law
school, considered among the top law schools. He had been associate
editor of the school's law review, Shapiro said.
   He was offered a job upon graduation and joined the firm
full-time in 1978.
   Fontana, who worked as a general litigator, was respected for
his ability to present a case in court, Shapiro said, and was
promoted to junior partner three years ago.
   He was well-liked by colleagues at the firm, Shapiro said.
``Like doesn't really say it. He was loved, still is.''
   But on April 25, Shapiro said, Fontana ``revealed to us for the
first time that he had not graduated from law school, that he left
school in December 1977 short one credit hour, that he had intended
to make up that hour with a paper but had failed to do so.
   ``As a consequence of this, he did not take the bar exam in
1978, although he told the firm that he had, and later that he had
passed the exam,'' Shapiro said.
   He would not say how the firm learned the truth and would not
discuss how the firm checks credentials of potential employees.
   Shapiro would not comment on whether the firm plans legal or
disciplinary action against Fontana, but an attorney who
specializes in defending lawyers charged with malpractice said
Fontana and his former law firm could face troublesome issues.
   ``You have the potential exposure for malpractice claims _
barring statute of limitations issues _ and there would have to be
a tie-in between an adverse result to client and the showing that
result was due to negligence on part of the lawyer and the lack of
qualification,'' said John Roadhouse.
   Authorities at the University of Michigan law school could not
be reached for comment. Susan Eklund, dean of student affairs, did
not return phone calls.
   A student at the law review confirmed that Fontana had worked on
the review about 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Plan to Commemorate Woman Acquitted In Parents' Ax Murders Stirs

<TEXT>
   Some residents here want to bury the
hatchet, as it were, and establish a display to commemorate the
city's most notorious daughter, Lizzie Borden.
   But others say that honoring the woman who was acquitted 96
years ago of the brutal ax murders of her parents would be like
opening a museum for the Boston Strangler or Lee Harvey Oswald.
   A promoter's proposal to offer a Lizzie Borden audio-visual
display at Heritage State Park for a year or so, charging admission
and splitting the proceeds with the state, will be the subject of a
public hearing later this month.
   ``It has split the city,'' Brad Durfee, acting Chamber of
Commerce president, said Friday. ``People are talking on the
streets about it, and it's stirred up things, really.''
   ``I've seen some people who are outspokenly against it, and I've
seen others who are outspokenly for it,'' said Ken Fiola, director
of project management at the Fall River Office of Economic
Management. ``Right now, I'd say that it's 50-50.''
   The dispute is the latest chapter in the controversy over
Borden, a prim, 32-year-old Sunday school teacher when the grisly
killings of her merchant father and her stepmother in August 1892
put the textile mill town 40 miles south of Boston on the map.
   Claiming she was out of the house when the killings occurred,
Miss Borden was found innocent of the slayings a year later. But no
murderer was ever found, and the case refuses to die.
   Despite the court ruling, several experts have written books
contending that Borden, who died in 1927, was the perpetrator and
have offered various motives.
   She also was immortalized in plays and the grim children's
rhyme, ``Lizzie Borden took an ax, and gave her mother 40 whacks.
When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41.''
   Some opponents of the proposal argue against any Borden exhibit,
saying that it would serve to glorify an unsavory aspect of the
city's past and besmirch the community of just over 90,000 just
when it is trying to rid itself of its gritty mill-town image.
   Others take issue with staging it in a state park, depicting the
exhibit as a pure profit-seeking enterprise that has no place on
land set aside by Massachusetts for the free enjoyment of all.
   ``The park was never meant to be a money-making venture,'' said
Stephen Lopes, chairman of the park's Steering Committee.
   ``Literally hundreds of people ... support my stand on this
particular issue,'' Lopes said.
   ``They're telling me that the city has made great progress, and
to go back to the negative and unsolved murders of two prominent
citizens is totally out of concept.''
   But promoter Paul R. Mulvihill, the originator of the plan to
create an audiovisual production with re-creations of the Borden
house, courtroom and trial, sought to downplay such concerns.
   ``I'd say 60 percent of the people here would like the legend to
be re-created,'' said Mulvihill, who was involved in establishing
the popular Salem Witch Museum that examines the famous 18th
century trials of that Massachusetts town.
   He estimates the admission charge for his proposed venture would
be $3.50, and that the program would be offered at the park's
visitor center for roughly a year.
   Mulvihill argued that both the city and the state would benefit
financially from a Borden exhibit, adding that state parks have a
mandate ``to educate citizens.''
   Fiola concurred, saying any display would serve ``as an
educational forum, and the spinoff from the expected tourist draw
would translate into money for the city and the state.''

   Saying the country is ``fed up with
white-collar crime,'' the head of the Justice Department's
antitrust division Friday urged longer jail terms for business
executives engaging in price-fixing and larger fines for companies
engaging in anti-competitive practices.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said there is a trend
toward more jail time and heavier fines in antitrust cases, but
``the averages are still too low.'' Recently enacted federal
sentencing guidelines should result in more severe penalties, Rule
said in remarks prepared for release in San Francisco. Copies of
his speech to a lawyers' group were released in Washington.
   Rule said the average jail term imposed on all people convicted
in antitrust division cases in the past 10 years was less than two
months.
   ``This country is fed up with white-collar crime and wants
judges to start treating white-collar criminals like the crooks
they really are,'' Rule said. ``Antitrust crimes are nothing more
than sophisticated larceny.''
   Newly instituted federal sentencing guidelines require judges to
sentence antitrust defendants to confinement for a minimum of four
months.
   In addition, the guidelines require fines based on the volume of
commerce attributable to the defendant. An individual conspirator
must be fined from four percent to 10 percent of the volume of the
commerce done by him in goods or services that were affected by the
conspiracy, but not less than $20,000.
   For corporations and other organizations, the guidelines provide
for fines ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent of the volume of
commerce done by the organization in goods or services affected by
the violation, but not less than $100,000. The maximum corporate
fine now is $1 million.
   ``While we are now witnessing an increased willingness of judges
to take antitrust felonies seriously. Some judges in the past have
shown undue lenience toward antitrust criminals,'' Rule said.
   Rule said a recent study estimates that the Justice Department's
prosecution of 52 price-fixing conspiracies from 1962 to 1980
prevented the theft of about $2 billion that the conspiracies would
have achieved had they not been stopped. The department has brought
560 cases in the past seven years.
   Rule was addressing a legal education conference sponsored by
the American Law Institute and the American Bar Association.

   The socialist Labor Party hailed its strong
showing in municipal elections Friday as a national rejection of
Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's right-wing program
and its shake-up of the welfare system.
   ``There's a sea change in British politics _ there's a direct
rejection of what the Tories are doing,'' Labor leader Neil Kinnock
declared, surrounded by jubilant party workers.
   Labor overtook the Conservatives, but the Tories tightened their
hold in the prosperous south. The two major parties captured
control of seven councils each where no party previously had
overall control.
   ``Very encouraging, very encouraging. We got many councils,''
Mrs. Thatcher told reporters outside her 10 Downing St. office.
   The major loser was the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic
Party, which lost support to the two big parties as it paid for
internal fueding that followed Mrs. Thatcher's third successive
victory last June.
   It was formed in March to merge the centrist Liberal Party and
Social Democratic Party, but a breakaway faction remained as a
separate party.
   With results in from all 211 local authorities contested, Labor
gained 104 seats, for a total of 1,898, the British domestic news
agency Press Association calculated. The Conservatives had a net
gain of five seats, for 1,135. The centrists lost 75 to end up with
365 seats.
   David Steel, the centrist party's co-leader, acknowledged, ``It
is bad, not good.''
   ``But it was not a disaster considering the appalling year it
has been for us ... I am relieved considering our internal
difficulties,'' he added.
   The Conservatives now control 48 of the contested cities and
towns, compared with 41 previously; Labor has 93, up from 91, and
centrists retained six. The Scottish Nationalists control one
district, while the rest belong to independents or have no party
with overall control.
   Labor retained control of major prizes, including Birmingham,
Britain's second largest city, and the Scottish capital, Edinburgh.
   But Labor lost control of Bradford, a key northern industrial
city, where no party now has an overall majority.
   No elections were held this year in London and Northern Ireland.
   The local elections were fought on national issues as Mrs.
Thatcher presses on with sweeping changes in welfare and education
and a controversial new property tax.
   The Conservative leader, having tamed labor unions and curbed
inflation since winning power in 1979, sees the changes as part of
her drive to bury socialism in Britain, increase personal
responsibility and end the ``dependency culture'' of the welfare
state.
   Critics, including some uneasy Tory rank-and-file legislators,
have criticized the changes for bearing unfairly on the poor.
   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley said the results were a
``remarkable achievement'' for a government pushing through major
changes.
   ``It has been a pretty difficult patch ... We are holding up,''
he said.
   The Conservatives, who lost all but 10 of the 72 Scottish
parliamentary seats in last June's election, again failed to dent
the deep-rooted hostility to the Thatcher administration north of
the border.
   Unofficial estimates by the British New Agency show an average
voter turnout of about 40 percent. The figure is normal for
municipal elections, which always register lower turnouts than
general elections.
   The Scottish National Party reported the turnout in Scotland's
53 districts was 48 percent, compared with 44 percent four years
ago when these seats were last contested.

   Palestinian factions battled for control
of Beirut's refugee camps Friday and rival Shiite Moslem militias
fought each other in the slums around them. Police said 28 people
were killed and 90 wounded.
   Ambulances raced through the streets of Moslem west Beirut. The
American University Hospital said its emergency wards were filled.
   Police said 16 people were killed and 50 wounded in the Shiite
slums, where the fight was between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the mainstream Amal militia allied with Syria.
   The Lebanese Red Cross said its volunteers took at least 23
wounded from the slums to hospitals in west Beirut, which is
policed by the Syrian army.
   ``Dozens of other bleeding fighters lay on the streets,'' a Red
Cross official said. ``We could not help them because of the
intensity of sniping.''
   Twelve combatants were killed and 40 wounded in the Chatilla and
Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camps, police reported. The struggle
there involves PLO chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah guerrillas and Saeed
Mousa's Syrian-backed group Fatah-Uprising.
   Both intramural wars began before dawn and continued into the
night despite repeated calls for cease-fires. Mortar, rocket and
small-arms fire could be heard through the city.
   The Amal-Hezbollah confrontation began with the overnight ambush
of an Amal patrol in which four Amal militamen were killed,
including three brothers from the prominent Nassereddin clan. They
were included in the overall casualty count.
   Police said gunfire raked their jeep. Amal blamed Hezbollah, and
Amal militiamen went into the streets to hunt down Hezbollah
members.
   Fighting spread through several areas of the southern slums,
including the Hezbollah strongholds Bir el-Abed and Hay Madi and
the densly populated Ghobeiri and Haret Hreik districts.
   It was the heaviest fighting among Shiites since a four-day Amal
crackdown on Hezbollah in south Lebanon last month in which 62
people were killed and 150 wounded.
   Hezbollah is Iran's main ally in Lebanon and is believed to be
an umbrella for extremist factions holding most of the 18 foreign
hostages in the country.
   Amal's action against Hezbollah suggests that Syria wants to
crush Iran's challenge to its role as the main power broker in
Lebanon, where 25,000 Syrian soldiers are stationed.
   Syria backs Iran in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war but has been
angered by Iranian efforts to dominate the 1.2 million Lebanese
Shiites, the largest sect in a nation torn by 13 years of civil war.
   About 7,500 Syrian troopers have policed west Beirut for more
than a year, but have not entered the Shite slums.
   They did not intervene in the Amal-Hezbollah collision but
surrounded Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh and were seen firing
heavy machine guns into the two Palestinian shantytowns.
   ``We are seeking to warn them to stop their stray fire against
our positions,'' a Syrian officer told reporters near Chatilla's
entrance. ``We're not intervening.''
   Another said: ``We are neutral. Syria is against any
inter-Palestinian fighting. We want the PLO to get reunited.''
   Palestinian antagonists pounded each other's positions in the
dusty camp alleys with 82mm and 60mm mortars, 106mm recoilless guns
and rocket-propelled grenades, police said.
   Each side accused the other of starting the fighting.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, an official of Arafat's Fata, the main
fighting force of the Palestine Liberation Organization, had asked
Syria to intervene with Fatah-Uprising to stop the battle.
   Police said Arafat loyalists controlled the eastern sector of
Chatilla and Fatah-Uprising dominated the western half near the
Syrians.
   Heavy sniping on the camp's only clear road made it difficult
for Chatilla's 3,000 residents to flee amd few tried.
   ``I don't know why they are doing this to us,'' a Palestinian
woman said at her home near the eastern entrance. ``We can't take
it any more. I already lost my husband in the camps war. I don't
want to lose my four children.''
   More than 1,600 people were killed and 3,600 wounded in a
three-year battle between the PLO and Amal that ended after the
Syrians intervened in April 1987.

<HEAD>Actor Describes Trip To Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sight of people on the verge of starvation
in Ethiopia was nearly enough to make tough-guy actor Lloyd Bridges
cry.
   ``This one particular mother had a baby in her arms. She just
lost her husband,'' Bridges said Friday of his trip last month to
food distribution centers in Ethiopia.
   ``There were personal things like that ... that were hard to
accept, that a human being would have to go through such agony to
keep herself together,'' said Bridges, who starred in television's
``Sea Hunt.''
   ``It's hard to keep from bursting into tears. When you're a
parent yourself it's hard to take,'' he said. ``I certainly felt
like crying. I didn't actually weep. I'm still weeping internally.''
   Bridges was in Ethiopia shooting footage for commercials and
public service announcements for CARE, a relief agency. Dramatic
television footage in 1984-85 produced an international response to
massive starvation in Ethiopia.
   CARE spokesman George Wirt said that nearly 3 million are on the
verge of starvation in the same areas now: ``It seems to be coming
back.''

   A federal judge agreed Friday to delay
closing arguments in the cocaine-smuggling trial of reputed
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas until Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton granted the one-day delay
after defense attorneys sought a two-day postponement to make up
for time lost due to the illness of attorney Edward R. Shohat.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle is to give his closing statement
Tuesday. Shohat will close for the defense on Wednesday and Stephen
Weinbaum, who represents co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, will
finish Wednesday afternoon or Thurday morning. Merkle also has
asked for three hours of rebuttal.
   The jury would get the case Friday, Melton said.
   The judge and attorneys met Friday to iron out jury instructions
and last-minute details to prepare for the closing of the trial. A
similar meeting is scheduled Monday.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is
charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.
   Lehder, 38,is accused in the Jacksonville case of smuggling 3.3
tons of cocaine into the United States from his private island of
Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   Lehder also is also charged in separate indictments in Los
Angeles and Miami. The Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one
of the leaders of the so-called Medellin Cartel, believed to be
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into United
States.

   Two Romanian sisters who are studying the violin
have apparently won their case for political asylum in the United
States, but they've been working too hard to celebrate.
   Rodica and Mihaela Oancea, students at Rice University's
Shepherd School of Music, said they received the news as the
semester ended.
   ``It came when we are so busy with school, so we haven't
celebrated too much,'' Mihaela, 18, said Thursday.
   The sisters arrived last July with tourist visas, planning to
visit Sergiu Luca, a Romanian concert violinist who teaches at
Rice, and defect.
   INS spokesman Mike McMahon said the two have received tentative
approval, but must be interviewed for a final determination. Their
attorney, Gordon Quan, said the sisters will soon be able to file
for permanent residency.
   Their father, Nicolae, a mechanical engineer, was known for his
anti-communist stance, the sisters said, and Romanian police
sometimes conducted random searches at their home.
   The women hope their father and mother, Elena, a high-school
chemistry teacher, can also come to the United States.
   Mihaela wants to continue her studies at Rice, while Rodica, 21,
will get her degree in another year and audition for a symphony
seat.

<HEAD>Practical Pampering: Valet Parking Comes to Downtown Cedar Rapids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SPEER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the black Audi GT rolls to a stop,
a valet in a red vest and black bow tie opens the door, gives a
cheery ``Hello'' and zips the car away to park it for the driver.
   Is this a pricey restaurant? A swank hotel?
   No. Downtown Cedar Rapids.
   This eastern Iowa city with a population of 110,000 is giving
valet parking a three-month trial run in its congested downtown to
encourage people to shop and conduct other business there.
   ``No matter what it seemed like we did for downtown development,
we still had that one major pitfall _ parking,'' Mayor Don Canney
said.
   ``You think of valet parking at posh restaurants or at hotels
where parking is not highly visible,'' said Canney. ``In this case,
it's a service geared to eliminate the hassle of parking ramps or
meters.''
   In its first four days, the service parked 128 cars, from
Cadillacs to Yugos.
   The city-run service employs eight valets and two cashiers, and
is offered from 30 minutes before downtown stores open until 30
minutes after they close, Monday through Saturday. Four hours'
parking costs $2.
   Some motorists found it perplexing.
   ``How does this work?'' Chris Sterner, of Marion, asked an
attendant Friday. ``Will you give me enough time to get my stroller
out of the car?''
   Attendant Ira Hatter even offered to help.
   Mrs. Sterner used the valet parking as she took her 5-week-old
son Joey downtown to show him off to co-workers.
   ``When I'm not on maternity leave, I park downtown every day,''
she said. ``Let somebody else deal with it today.''
   Parking cashier Chris Elliott said the service was believed to
be only the second in the country for downtown shoppers. The other
is in Anaheim, Calif., he said.
   ``I think that generally, people still like to be pampered,''
Elliott said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strict sentencing guidelines imposed in
November for federal crimes have been ruled unconstitutional by a
panel of U.S. District Court judges in California's Central
District.
   The federal judges voted 14-10 Thursday to reject the guidlines
imposed by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a seven-member group
formed by Congress.
   Federal judges in Maryland also have declared the guidelines
unconstitutional. Individual judges elsewhere have disagreed on
whether to implement the rules.
   ``The Department of Justice wants to take this up to the Supreme
Court on an expedited basis,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney James
Berliner. ``We look forward to a prompt resolution by that court.''
   The guidelines set up a prescribed range of penalties based on
the severity of the crime and the defendant's background. Although
designed to make federal sentencing more uniform, some jurists say
they unfairly restrict a judge's ability to select the best
sentence in individual cases.
   The decision here affects 32 federal judges working in the
seven-county Central District, which extends from San Luis Obispo
to San Clemente.
   The majority opinion written by Judge A. Andrew Hauk attacked
the constitutionality of the guidelines in two areas.
   He wrote that the sentencing restrictions violate a defendant's
right to due process by barring judges from their ``traditional and
fundamental'' ability to exercise discretion.
   They also violate constitutional separation of powers among the
three branches of government because three federal judges serve on
the sentencing commission formed by Congress, Hauk wrote.

   House Republicans have decided to omit from the
annual budget a proposed footnote criticizing college instructors
who are not articulate in English.
   ``Some of the brightest people we have don't speak English very
well,'' said state Rep. John Ulvang.
   House GOP members voted 27-5 Thursday to eliminate the Senate
measure, which chided foreign-born college instructors.
   However, the House-Senate conference committee working on a
compromise budget bill had already voted to eliminate the footnote
and, instead, send a letter of concern to colleges.
   Sen. Wayne Allard, who proposed the footnote, said he will not
pursue the matter. ``I just wanted to bring the issue up and call
it to everyone's attention,'' he said.
   Allard said he had received several complaints from students at
Colorado State University about incomprehensible instructors.
   Some officials said they doubted the legality of the footnote
since the state constitution bars inclusion of issues other than
spending in the annual budget bill.

   A watch traded by a famished American
prisoner of war for a piece of bread near the end of World War II
has found its way back to the soldier's widow.
   Thomas Willis Pitts, who was captured during the Battle of the
Bulge in December 1944, gave his watch to a fellow prisoner for the
bread at a compound at Muhlberg, Germany.
   After the war, Pitts returned to his job with the Internal
Revenue Service, where he worked until retirement in 1976. He died
in June.
   After her husband's death, Esther Pitts joined the 106th
Infantry Division Association Inc., composed of men who had
belonged to the division and their wives. One day while looking
through the organization's magazine, she saw this notice from
Theodore William Young of Ozark, Ala.
   ``Anybody out there who traded a watch for bread in 1945? ... I
had a piece of bread ... when some GI came over to me and said,
`I'll give you this watch for your bread.' I still have the watch
(and) would like to return it.''
   ``When I saw the ad, I got cold all over,'' Mrs. Pitts said. ``I
said, `That's got to be Willis'.'''
   She wrote Young and described the watch. They agreed it had been
her husband's.
   Young said he kept the watch in an old matchbox for the rest of
the war. When he returned home, then in Columbus, Ohio, Young gave
the timepiece to his father-in-law.
   About four years ago, the father-in-law returned the watch to
Young.
   The watch, still keeping time, was delivered to Mrs. Pitts' home
Monday.

<HEAD>WHO Says Only Half Of World's Children Are Immunized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization said Friday only
half the world's children are immunized against polio and 275,000
children are still being stricken with the disease in developing
countries each year.
   Dr. Halfdan Mahler, outgoing director-general of the WHO, called
for a campaign to eradicate the disease worldwide by the year 2000.
   The WHO, the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International
Development and other relief agencies already spend $150 million a
year to immunize children against polio and five other major
childhood diseases, measles, diptheria, whooping cough, tetanus and
tuberculosis.
   The WHO estimated that the agencies would have to raise that
budget to $500 million to achieve the goal of wiping out polio,
just as smallpox was eradicated a decade ago.
   In addition to the efforts by international agencies, individual
countries are spending $350 million annually to immunize their
children. That effort, too, needs to be stepped up, according to a
report from the Geneva-based health organization.
   Polio, which terrorized U.S. families in the 1950s before
development of vaccines, is now rare in developed countries. There
was only one reported case in the United States in 1986, and the
WHO said transmission of the polio virus is expected to be
eradicated from the Western Hemisphere by 1990.
   The disease attacks the central nervous system in severe cases
and causes paralysis; one in 10 people paralyzed by the infection
dies. In its mild form, polio is characterized by headaches, sore
throat and fever.
   Ten million people in the world today are lame from bouts with
polio, the WHO said.
   It said the countries with the most reported cases of the
disease in 1986 were: India 14,600 cases; Afghanistan 1,843;
Vietnam 1,600; China 1,537; Bangladesh 810; Brazil 665; Yemen 579;
Philippines 533 and Laos 523.
   The WHO believes only 1 in 10 cases worldwide is reported to its
Geneva headquarters.
   The organization said it costs $10 to immunize a child against
polio and other major diseases. The costs may be higher, however,
to reach children in remote parts of the world, it said.

   A police officer was shot in the face with his own
gun Friday during a struggle with a burglary suspect outside a pawn
shop, officials said.
   Steven L'Huillier, 28, a six-year veteran and 1983 rookie of the
year, was in serious but stable condition after surgery at
Methodist Medical Center, spokeswoman Brenda Vrana said.
   Police said L'Huillier was shot in the cheek with his
.45-caliber gun and the bullet lodged in his jaw.
   A 20-year-old man arrested near the scene was being questioned,
although no charges have been filed, police spokesman Ed Spencer
said.
   Police said the suspect is a parolee released from the state
prison in March after serving 18 months on a five-year sentence for
theft. Spencer said the man faces charges of attempted capital
murder and burglary.
   The incident began when L'Huillier and his partner responded to
a burglary call early Friday at Weldon's Pawn Shop.
   The two officers split up and walked to different sides of the
building.
   Investigator Hollis Edwards said L'Huillier surprised a suspect.
``He struggled with the suspect, and the suspect gained access to
his weapon,'' Edwards said.
   A shot was fired, and his partner found L'Huillier kneeling on
the ground, wounded. Police said the suspect fled with the
revolver, which was recovered later from the back of pickup truck
near the scene.
   Police searching on foot and with helicopters later captured a
man matching the description given them by L'Huillier. The man had
blood on his clothes and he emerged from between two houses near
the shooting scene.
   The suspect told police that he was in the neighborhood looking
for lawns to mow.
   The suspect is black and the officer white, but Spencer said
race was not a factor in the shooting, the 11th this year involving
a Dallas officer. Three officers have been slain.
   The January fatal shooting of Officer John Glenn Chase sparked
tensions between the mostly white police force and the minority
community when then-police Chief Billy Prince blasted black elected
officials, saying their criticisms of the department helped foster
a climate of hatred of police.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Shows Strong Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $4.46 billion more in
installment credit than they paid off in March, the fourth
consecutive strong monthly increase, the government said Friday in
a report that provided more evidence or strong consumer spending.
   The March gain in consumer debt was down from a $5.04 billion
increase in February, but still represented an annual rate of gain
of 8.6 percent, the Federal Reserve said.
   For the first three months of the year, consumer borrowing
increased at a 10.3 percent annual rate, compared with 7.2 percent
all of last year.
   However, analysts said rising interest rates and weak wage
increases likely would slow consumer borrowing in the months ahead.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington
forecasting firm, attributed the growth to strong pre-Easter
spending in March and to relatively high level of auto sales.
   The credit report said car loans increased $3.21 billion in
March, a 14.1 percent annual growth rate, compared with a 14.5
percent rate in February.
   The category which includes credit card debt grew $2.22 billion,
a strong 16.3 percent growth rate, which followed a gain at a 10.3
percent rate in February.
   The growth was offset by declines in borrowing to purchase
mobile homes and in the category including loans from banks and
credit unions not secured by real estate.
   Non-real estate loans fell by $796 million, a drop at a 5.4
percent annual rate, after rising at a 3.4 percent rate in February
and a 6.0 percent rate in January.
   Ms. Shaber said the evidence of strong consumer spending in
March, coupled with a drop in the civilian unemployment rate in
April to 5.4 percent, the lowest since 1974, may increase fears
that inflation will heat up.
   However, she said she expected growth in consumer spending to
slow in the months ahead because salary and wage increases have
been weak.
   ``My feeling is people will overstate what this means. ... Car
sales weakened a bit in April and department store sales were
terrible,'' she said.
   ``Consumer credit is not going to be growing in the months ahead
as it did in the first quarter. ... A lot people are working, but
on a per-worker basis, wages and salaries are not keeping up with
inflation.''
   She said consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds
of the nation's economy, would likely grow by 2 percent this year,
similar to the 1.9 percent growth last year, but only about half of
the growth rate earlier in the expansion.
   Analysts say rising interest rates, by boosting the cost of
credit purchases, are likely to dampen spending.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Friday that fixed-rate
mortgages rose in the current week to 10.32 percent, up from 10.28
percent a week earlier.

   An earthquake shook southern Nicaragua
Friday, damaging buildings and sending frightened residents rushing
into the streets. No injuries were reported.
   Alejandro Rodriguez, director of the government's Institute of
Land Studies, said a local seismograph registered the quake at 8:46
a.m. (10:46 a.m. EDT) and the tremor had a magnitude of 5.9 on the
Richter scale.
   He said the quake was centered near San Rafael del Sur, 15 miles
south of Managua, and there was no cause for alarm. Radio
broadcasts called on the public to remain calm.
   Managua was devastated by an earthquake in December 1972 that
killed at least 10,000 people. The city has not been completely
rebuilt and the shells of abandoned concrete buildings remain in
what was once the downtown area.
   Friday's quake was felt in northern Costa Rica, but officials
there said they had no reports of damages or injuries.
   Workers and residents in Managua returned to their daily
routines within minutes after the quake. Some said they had not
noticed any tremors.
   Radio Sandino reported some buildings were damaged in Rivas, 70
miles south of Managua. Landslides were reported in southern
Nicaragua near the Asososca lagoon, which provides a significant
part of Managua's drinking water.
   Earthquakes are common in Nicaragua. On April 21 a quake
registering 4.8 on the Richter scale rattled sections of the
country but caused no damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion recorded on seismographs. Every
increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas and one registering 6 is capable of causing severe
damage.

   Attackers shot to death a police
captain and a retired sergeant in front of their homes Friday,
bringing the number of people killed in a three-day spasm of
violence to at least 26.
   Police said they believed the killers of Capt. Teofilo Tan, a
deputy station commander, and retired Sgt. Feliciano Belandrez were
members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila unit of communist
guerrillas who have been fighting the government for 20 years.
   The brigade has been blamed for the killings of more than 100
policemen and soldiers in daylight ambushes in Manila and its
suburbs since early 1987.
   Military officials said communist rebels of the New People's
Army also killed a neighborhood leader and two soldiers in separate
ambushes Friday on the outskirts of Legaspi City, 215 miles
southeast of Manila.
   They said a fourth man was found dead at a school there, but
police did not know who killed him. Human rights groups in Legaspi
said the victim was a known leftist and they believed he was killed
by anti-communist vigilantes.
   Officials say at least 20 people have been slain since Wednesday
in clashes between soldiers and rebels.
   A senator quoted President Corazon Aquino as saying Friday she
did not want members of Ferdinand E. Marcos' immediate family to
attend the funeral of the exiled former president's mother because
they might be assassinated.
   Marcos, his wife and three children fled to Hawaii in February
1986 after a civilian-military uprising drove him from the office
he had held for 20 years and put Mrs. Aquino in power. Her
government has banned the Marcos' from the country.
   On Wednesday, after Josefa Edralin-Marcos died at age 95, Mrs.
Aquino said she would not allow Marcos to return for the funeral,
citing national security considerations.
   Asked by reporters Thursday if she would allow Marcos' son
Ferdinand Jr. to attend the funeral, the president said she had
received no such request and would respond only if one was made.
   Sen. John Osmena told reporters Friday: ``The president
expressed concern that security might be imperilled, and it could
be possible that enemies of the government will make attempts (on
the life of Marcos' son) so as to embarrass the government.''
   Osmena said Mrs. Aquino made the remark ``in passing'' during a
ceremony at the presidential palace. He said Mrs. Aquino scoffed at
suggestions that the body be flown to Hawaii so Marcos can pay his
respects.
   Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, said Mrs.
Aquino asked him if he thought Ferdinand Marcos Jr. should be
permitted to visit and he advised against it.
   ``I don't think any member of the Marcos family should be
allowed here,'' he said. ``It would only cause trouble.''
   A brother and sister of the former president said they hope Mrs.
Aquino will change her mind and have not set a funeral date.

<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists shot to death a family
of seven and then killed a blind man and another person while
making their escape, the United News of India said Friday.
   Four other killings also were reported overnight in Punjab
state. The slayings raised to 900 the number of deaths blamed on
Sikh extremists this year.
   The lower house of Parliament voted Friday to extend federal
rule in Punjab for another six months. The upper house was expected
to approve the action.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi dismissed the Sikh-dominated state
government on May 11, 1987, for failing to curb the Sikh
separatists. Since then, the federal government has directed
security and day-to-day operations in the state. The federal rule
was due to expire Tuesday.
   The United News of India said the slain family included Harbans
Singh, his wife, three sons and two daughters. It said the killings
occurred Thursday night in the village of Gulhar in the
southeastern part of the state.
   The extremists also killed two people while escaping from the
area, the news agency said. One was reported to be a Sikh, the
other identified only as a blind man. It had no details on the four
other deaths.
   Most victims of the victims of Sikh violence have been Hindus or
moderate Sikhs.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   They have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982 for more
political autonomy or an independent Sikh homeland in Punjab.

<TEXT>
   Pravda heaped praise on one of China's 14 open
economic zones Friday and suggested that the Soviet Union needs a
rebirth of working spirit to bring similar prosperity.
   The authors of the article on China's Tianjin region did not
draw direct lessons from it, but recited the accomplishments in the
open zones and said the success of ``Chinese perestroika'' was due
to an inspired work force.
   Perestroika is the name Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev gives
his plans for economic and social reform in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has referred to the Chinese economic experiments
favorably but the article in the Communist Party newspaper was the
most complimentary to date about developments in the neighboring
communist country.
   Soviet supporters of perestroika, which means restructuring,
have encouraged broader use of joint ventures to attract foreign
investment.
   Many problems face foreign business executives in the Soviet
Union, however, including low worker productivity, unreliable
delivery of supplies, poor storage and transportation facilities,
and poor hotels and living accommodations.
   The fact that the ruble is non-convertible, not traded on world
currency markets, complicates joint ventures and has reduced the
number the Soviets have been able to negotiate.
   China's 14 open economic zones contain only 8 percent of the
nation's 1 billion people but account for more than one-quarter of
industrial production and 40 percent of exports, Pravda said. The
paper noted that they were established only four years ago.
   Its report was the second this week praising China's economic
policies. In the government newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday, writer
Chingiz Aitmatov criticized Soviet agriculture and pointed to a
Chinese move away from large collectives toward family farming.
   Pravda raised the question whether ``Chinese perestroika'' had
succeeded at the expense of workers and answered that it had not.
Pay in the open zones averages 50 percent more than for similar
jobs in other parts of the country, the newspaper said, but greater
productivity makes labor costs lower.
   China's special economic zones have attracted foreign capital
and joint ventures because the Chinese built the necessary support
facilities, Pravda said.
   In the Tianjin region, buildings ``literally pop up like a
mirage in the desert,'' it said, and developers built luxury
hotels, a golf course, sports clubs and other services that make
Western business executives feel comfortable while in the area to
oversee their enterprises.
   Transport problems were worked out ahead of time to ensure
enough shipping capacity and a lenient tax system has drawn more
foreign investment each year, the newspaper said.
   Pravda said the Tianjin region alone had 80 contracts for joint
ventures and more than $100 million was invested there in 1987.

<HEAD>Wright's Office Fire Sparks Debate Over Safety of Capitol
Buildings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overseer of congressional buildings said
Friday that the structures exceed federal safety standards, but a
fire chief-turned-congressman said a blaze in House Speaker Jim
Wright's office demonstrates the need for improvement.
   ``The federal government should accept no fire standards less
than they require of private businesses downtown,'' said Rep. Curt
Weldon, R-Pa., whose office is next to Wright's in the Longworth
House Office Building.
   Weldon, a former volunteer fire chief in suburban Philadelphia,
said the fire Thursday was able to rage unimpeded for 10 minutes
because the building opened in 1933 lacked fire hoses and alarms.
   Elliott Carroll, executive assistant to Capitol Architect George
C. White, contended that congressional office buildings are ``as
safe as any place in the world,'' and that the damage to Wright's
office was minor.
   Still, Carroll told reporters, a $47.5 million modernization
project is under way to make the congressional offices safer. Voice
fire alarms and smoke detectors will be put in the buildings, but
there will be no new sprinkler systems installed, he said.
   And ``the monumental space'' _ those with extensive historic
value _ will not be touched, he said.
   Carroll said congressional buildings ``meet and exceed'' the
Building Officials' Conference of America code, which is described
as the national standard.
   ``All these buildings are fireproof,'' said Carroll. ``They all
are made out of brick and stone. The solidness of the buildings can
be shown by the fact that the fire was contained in one room.''
   Carroll said the fire started in a copying machine located in a
kitchenette in Wright's second-floor office and was confined to
that room. Two other rooms received smoke and water damage, he said.
   He placed the damage estimate at $10,000. The District of
Columbia Fire epartment had estimated Thursday night that the fire
caused $120,000 in damage, but Carroll said the lower figure was
more accurate because repairs would be done by congressional
employees.
   Had there been hoses in the hallway, Weldon said, ``we could
have put the fire out with little damage. I was told that the D.C.
Fire Department recommended that the inch-and-a-half hoses be
removed because they sometimes deteriorate. That's what inspections
are for.''
   Capt. Ted Holmes, spokesman for the D.C. Fire Department; Ken
Butters, president of the International Association of Fire Chiefs,
and Carroll said the hoses were removed because fire departments
won't use them.
   ``You have to be aware that the D.C. Fire Department does not
use any of those hoses because of deterioration and the (water)
pressure would splinter them,'' Holmes said.
   Carroll said the Capitol and congressional office buildings are
exempt from localfire code laws, not by law but because all federal
buildings are exempt from them.
   Butters explained that this was the case because it would be too
difficult to write regulations to cover the entire nation. ``Just
about every local community writes its own code which usually is
more stringent than state or county codes,'' he said. For instance,
he said, it is not unusual for state universities to be exempt from
local codes.
   Carroll said the Capitol, the six congressional office
buildings, the three Library of Congress buildings and the Supreme
Court ``were all in compliance with local laws, and this is
important, at the time they were built. There is no requirement to
bring them up to higher standards.''
   Holmes said the District of Columbia uses the building
officials' association, but he declined to say whether the
buildings are now in compliance with the city's regulations. ``That
would be speculation on our part because we don't inspect them,''
he said.
   Holmes said the newer structures, such as the Senate's Hart and
Dirksen buildings, the House's Rayburn building, the library's
Madison building and the Supreme Court have state-of-the-art
equipment.
   The Longworth and Cannon House buildings and the Library's
Jefferson and Adams are currently being worked on. Some work has
been done on the Capitol and the Senate Russell buildings.

<HEAD>Bill Banning Late Abortions Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hisses and cheers rose from the gallery of the
House of Commons on Friday after a bill that would have restricted
the right to abortion was defeated by delay tactics.
   The measure would have been the first change in the law since
Britain legalized abortion in 1967. It would have barred abortions
after the 17th week of pregnancy instead of the 28th week, as the
current law allows.
   Conservative John Wakeham, the House leader, rejected a final
appeal for the government to provide extra time to secure passage
of the bill.
   During a heated debate, a spectator was ejected from the gallery
after shouting an expletive at a legislator who argued against
passage.
   Conservative Sir Bernard Braine denounced what he called ``the
scandal of late abortions for social or convenience reasons.''
   ``I'm talking about the right of life of the unborn,'' he said.
``We should remember that the unborn child marked down for abortion
has no choice at all.''
   Jo Richardson, a prominent feminist member of the opposition
Labor Party, accused supporters of taking an ``absolutist and
fundamentalist'' view of abortion.
   ``They are willing to barter with women's bodies and gamble with
children's lives to try to maximize support for this bill and
inflict a substantial blow on the 1967 act, which has given women
and doctors 20 years of safe, legal abortions,'' she said.
   Procedural wrangling left no time for a vote on whether the bill
should proceed to a final debate and vote in the House of Commons.
   Britain, by allowing abortions at up to 28 weeks, or about seven
months, of pregnancy, has one of the Western world's most liberal
abortion laws. In the United States, abortions are allowed without
regulation in the first three months of pregnancy.
   After that, some state regulation is allowed.
   Supporters of the new law argued that abortions should not be
allowed when a fetus might have a reasonable chance to survive
outside the womb. At 24 weeks, such survival is rare, but survival
at 28 weeks is estimated at 74 percent in optimal conditions. The
usual length of pregnancy is 40 weeks.
   Of the 172,286 abortions in England and Wales in 1986 _ the
latest year for which statistics are available _ 10,770, or 6
percent, were done after 17 weeks, according to the Department of
Health and Social Security.
   Opponents of the bill contended that an 18-week limit would deny
women the choice of abortion because of a fetal handicap, since it
might not be possible to detect the handicap at such an early stage
of pregnancy.
   Fourteen previous attempts to amend the 1967 Abortion Act have
failed, but Parliament's anti-abortion lobby had gained widespread,
bipartisan support for the latest bill.
   In January, the Commons approved the bill by a majority of 296
to 251 at a crucial parliamentary stage, leading to speculation
that it might be approved, albeit in a watered-down form.
   The medical profession and the government of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher had supported a four-week reduction in the time
limit, to 24 weeks. By withholding government support for an
18-week cutoff, Mrs. Thatcher had significantly lowered its chances
of passage but left open the possibility of a compromise.
   The bill's sponsor, David Alton of the Social and Liberal
Democratic Party, has said he would mount another attempt to
tighten the abortion law if his bill failed.

<HEAD>French Hostage Says Jailers Were Unstable</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-France-Hostages, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian Moslems holding foreigners hostage in
Lebanon often degraded their captives and ``took everything away
from us, even our first names,'' a freed French hostage was quoted
as saying Friday.
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, one of three French hostages released
Thursday, said one jailer carried out a terrifying mock execution.
   ``As everywhere else, I imagine, some of our jailers were very
human, but in a very hard context,'' Kauffmann was quoted as saying
by Agence France-Presse.
   ``There was an Abu Hassan who didn't speak a word of French but
who was attentive, obliging, always in a good humor, which was not
the case with many of his fellows, very unstable, sometimes
perverse. Most of them were not able to maintain a constant
attitude. The best alternated with the worst for reasons that
escaped us.''
   Another of his guards, whom Kauffmann identified as Abu Ali, was
particularly cruel.
   ``He left us in filth, because for him we were impure,'' said
Kauffmann, a reporter for the weekly Evenement du Jeudi who was
abducted May 22, 1985. ``He continued to humiliate us, not to
mention a mock execution in June 1987 which was particularly
frightening.''
   The first year, and above all the first weeks, were the most
difficult, Kauffmann was quoted as saying, ``because it took some
time for me to become accustomed to being a prisoner.
   ``They tried to degrade us. They took everything away from us,
even our first names.'' He said the kidnappers gave each of the
three French hostages a new name _ Habib for Marcel Carton, Najib
for Marcel Fontaine, and Labib for Kauffmann.
   The journalist said he was moved 18 times in his nearly three
years of captivity. His worst memory, apart from the death of
fellow French hostage Michel Seurat, was in the beginning of 1987
when the Syrians entered West Beirut.
   He said he was bound with cloth strips like a mummy and placed
in a sort of coffin under the bed of a truck.
   ``Before leaving, we had to swear to be silent each time the
vehicle stopped or we would be executed,'' Kauffmann was quoted as
telling AFP.
   After each move, the hostages had to renegotiate even the
smallest privileges, he was quoted as saying.
   ``The smallest change had a considerable affect on our existence
and our morale. A cup of coffee was a real festival.''

<HEAD>States Ask Court to Review DOT Rule on Airline Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five states asked a federal appeals
court Friday to review a new Transportation Department regulation
concerning air fare advertising that they contend undercuts state
consumer-protection laws.
   The petition for review filed with the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here said the March 10 order allowing airlines to advertise
air fares without including taxes, fees and other surcharges in the
total price ``conflicts with the states' interpretation of their
own consumer protection statutes.''
   The order ``will undercut the protections provided to consumers
to know the total price of air transportation,'' the petition said.
   The states contended that the total advertised price should
include ``foreign departure taxes, customs fees, immigration fees,
security fees'' and other charges imposed by government agencies.
   ``Each of the states interprets its consumer protection statutes
that it is a deceptive practice for airlines to advertise a price
to be paid by a consumer for air transportation without disclosing
the total price to be paid for the air transportation,'' the
petition said.
   The Transportation Department order allows the airlines to
advertise the air fare at the top of ads without including the fees
in the total price, provided that the fees are mentioned in
legible, readable type at the bottom of the ad.
   The petition was filed by the states of Alaska, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.

   Jesse Jackson declared Friday that
``California has the power to determine the next nominee of our
party'' and urged voters to ignore those who say the Democratic
race is locked up.
   ``California, here we are,'' he told a sun-soaked rally at Santa
Monica Community College.
   Earlier, in a dramatic speech to a high school rally, Jackson
spoke against gang violence, stating, ``I challenge you because I
love you, because I care, because I'm not scared of you.''
   ``When I become president, I'm going to break it up,'' he said
of the gang warfare.
   Referring to a rash of gang killings in the Los Angeles area,
Jackson said, ``You who are so precious, who are so dear, are
living beneath your privilege.''
   Some of the 3,000 Fremont High School youths in the athletic
field bleachers were wearing gang colors.
   Starting his campaign day at a labor breakfast, Jackson said the
race is still tight despite the wide delegate lead enjoyed by his
rival, Michael Dukakis.
   Speaking in a state with substantial dependence on military
contracts, Jackson also proposed non-military development of space
as a way to recover defense industry jobs that would be lost under
his proposed military budget freeze.
   He declined to give specifics when asked by reporters how many
jobs could be created in space development or how much spending he
proposed.
   With Dukakis holding nearly a 600-delegate lead, Jackson also
continued to call for party officials to ensure a ``reasonable
correlation'' between the primary popular vote, which stands at 37
percent to 28 percent against him, and the delegate count. There
are 314 delegates at stake in California's primary on June 7.
   ``This race is a close race, but it's about directions,'' he
told more than 400 unionists at a Los Angeles County Federation of
Labor breakfast.
   ``The press, the pundits, the party, the candidate _ it's not
just me and him; it's me and them,'' he said.
   After the speech, Jackson told reporters he does not consider
his call for fairness ``at all divisive.''
   But he said the party establishment ``super delegates'' should
wait until after the primary season ends before committing to a
candidate so they can help offset any imbalances in places where
the delegate count is not directly proportional to the popular vote.
   On another subject, he was asked by reporters what he sees as
Dukakis' weaknesses in the battle for Calfornia's delegates.
Jackson referred to what he said were state budget problems in
Massachusetts and said Dukakis as governor was cutting programs for
pregnant teens and for elderly people to make up revenue.
   Voters should consider, he said, ``As we look toward 1989, on
whose backs will we balance the budget?''
   The most dramatic event of Jackson's campaign day came after his
speech at Fremont High School in San Pedro. About 300 students came
down from the bleachers, admitted they used drugs and said they
would try not to any more.
   `If you've tried drugs and you want to get well, come on down,''
he said. ``Let them through the gate, our children want to get
well,'' Jackson told security officers at the fence separating his
stage from the bleachers.
   He had the teen-agers raise their hands and repeat the words,
``I can be and will be a better person.''
   Afterward, Stanley Chaney, 18, who said he had tried drugs once,
said, ``It was an experience for everybody.''
   ``It helped a lot. It makes you realize you're not by
yourself,'' said Gina Brooks, 17, who said she drank alcohol but
was not a drug user.
   One boy, who disavowed drug use, said he came down on the field
``because I just wanted to see him.''

<HEAD>Leukemia Risk Not Great Enough to Ban Growth Hormone Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children who receive hormones to help them
grow may face a slightly higher risk of developing leukemia, but
the increased risk _ even if proven _ is not great enough to
warrant withholding treatment, scientists said Friday.
   Cancer and growth experts from several countries met this week
to review 15 cases of leukemia worldwide in patients treated with
synthetic growth hormones. The meetings were prompted by reports of
leukemia in five Japanese children who had received the treatment.
   ``There is no therapy that is risk-free,'' said a statement by
the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, which represents
doctors and scientists working in the field. ``Because GH therapy
is essential for optimal growth and development in GH deficient
children, it would be inappropriate and unwise to withhold such
treatment from needy patients.''
   The group said it has not been proven that there is an increased
risk and patients can be told that if there is one, it is small.
   The incidence of leukemia among patients taking growth hormone
worldwide is estimated at 1 in 21,000 patient-years of treatment,
the society said, while a reasonable estimate of the risk among
nonpatients in the same age range is 1 in 42,000.
   Among the 15 cases examined, four were deemed not to have been
caused by the treatment because they either occurred within two or
three months of treatment or there were compelling reasons to
suspect other causes, the group said.
   The society said that if there is a relationship between growth
hormone treatment and leukemia the cause could be the effect of the
hormone on bone marrow cells, a contaminant in hormone
preparations, or the combined effect of the hormone and genetic or
environmental factors in certain patients.
   The Human Growth Foundation, which is supported by 1,000
families with children having growth disorders, participated in the
meetings that examined the cases. Experts came from the United
States, Canada, Japan, Australia and several European countries.
   The foundation had no figures immediately available on the
number of children currently receiving treatment.
   Manufacturers of growth hormones estimate that about 2 million
U.S. children are in the lowest 2 percentile by height, meaning
they are shorter than 98 percent of children their age.

   President Reagan assured a concerned West
German official Friday that U.S. commitment to Bonn and the NATO
alliance remains unshaken, the White House said.
   Reagan also told Dr. Alfred Dregger that ``U.S.-German
cooperation is the cornerstone of the NATO alliance,'' presidential
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   Dregger is chairman of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's majority faction
in the Bundestag (parliament). He said he was satisfied and
relieved by assurances from Reagan and other U.S. leaders that
nuclear disarmament will not be allowed to break the strategic
unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Urging the United States and the West to seize the intiative as
soon as possible in negotiating with the Soviet Union a reduction
of non-nuclear weapons in Europe, Dregger also told Reagan that
Bonn would cooperate fully in maintaining NATO's strategy of
flexible response, Popadiuk said.
   Reagan told the West German that U.S. ``commitment to Germany
and Western Europe is unshakeable,'' Popadiuk said.
   ``I am very satisfied with my sessions in Washington and I am
convinced that the alliance will guarantee the security of the
(German) Federal Republic and Europe for (another) 40 years,''
Dregger told reporters afterward.
   Dregger said Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and arms
control adviser Paul Nitze had confirmed to him ``that we will
continue to have unbroken unity of deterrence and risk-sharing
between North America and Europe, that the entire alliance will
remain a strategic unity.''
   Dregger said he also confirmed in his talks that sea-launched
cruise missiles and airborne nuclear weapons of medium range would
remain after the dismantling of land-based intermediate systems
under the treaty signed by Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at the Washington summit last December.
   ``Therefore we will still have medium-range missiles which
constitute a link between the strategic systems and the short-range
systems in Europe,'' Dregger said.
   The Bundestag defense expert said in a Thursday speech his
Christian-Democratic party would go along with plans for
modernizing short-range tactical nuclear weapons ``so long as
risk-sharing and deterrence sharing with respect to
intermediate-range weapons is maintained.'' This is because
``denuclearization of Europe would give full effect to the Soviet
Union's huge conventional and chemical superiority,'' he said.
   The Pentagon agreed with this but reacted sharply to Dregger's
statement that Germans want to pursue the question of ``whether
nuclear artillery is necessary and expedient.'' Dresser said this
should be covered in a comprehensive review of nuclear strategy for
disarmament ordered at the last NATO summit.
   When the issue of short-range nuclear weapons, those with ranges
of less than 300 miles, was raised with Reagan, the president said
their reduction would be discussed only after East-West balance is
achieved in conventional, non-atomic weapons, Popadiuk said.
   Dregger said the purpose of nuclear artillery ``can only be a
limited one'' such as ``to prevent the concentration of
conventional assault forces, especially tank armies.'' It should
not be relied on for a deterrent, he said, because the range is too
short to target eastward to Soviet territory, he said.
   But the Pentagon said Friday that ``modern nuclear artillery
rounds are an integral element'' of the minimum-level credible
nuclear deterrent posture approved in NATO's 1983 decision at
Montebello, Canada, and revalidated last month by the alliance's
defense ministers.
   ``Their elimination would have a number of adverse effects on
NATO flexible response strategy,'' the Pentagon said, starting with
reducing Soviet uncertainty as to ``when, where and how NATO would
respond to an attack.''
   Dregger said the greater the range of a modernized version of
the Lance missile, with a current range of 70 miles, the less will
be the need for nuclear artillery rounds. But the Pentagon declared
that ``both a follow-on to Lance and continued modernization of
nuclear artillery are necessary'' to keep NATO's nuclear deterrent
up to date.

<HEAD>Drug Used to Treat AIDS Patients to be Studied as Pre-Infection
Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of the AIDS drug Retrovir, citing
studies that the drug shows promise as a preventive treatment in
animal experiments, is launching a study to find out if the drug
can prevent infection in health workers exposed to the AIDS virus.
   ``There is some previous work in animal models of retroviral
infection which indicates that administration of Retrovir, if begun
within a few days of viral exposure and continued for only a few
weeks, may prevent the establishment of retroviral infection or
significantly alter disease progression,'' said Dr. Sandra
Nusinoff-Lehrman, associate head of the infectious diseases
department at Burroughs Wellcome.
   This is the first study by Burroughs Wellcome, the only
pharmaceutical company that makes Retrovir, to determine the drug's
ability to prevent HIV infection, company spokeswoman Kathy
Bartlett said Thursday.
   Retrovir, formerly known as AZT, is the only drug that has
received federal approval as an effective treatment against the
human immunodeficiency virus. There is currently no therapy proved
to prevent infection upon exposure to the AIDS virus.
   Health care workers who treat patients with AIDS and
accidentally come in direct contact with blood products infected
with HIV will be given Retrovir shortly after the exposure, Ms.
Bartlett said.
   Burroughs Wellcome will examine how well patients tolerate the
drug. Ms. Bartlett said the same dose recommended for treatment of
AIDS patients will be administered to health care workers.
   Retrovir has been found to cause nausea, insomnia, muscle pains
and bone marrow suppression in HIV-infected patients taking the
drug. The relatively brief period of Retrovir therapy is likely to
produce few significant side effects in healthy individuals, Dr.
Lehrman said.
   Company officials said it is too early to determine whether the
drug could be used to prevent infection among individuals in
high-risk groups who think they have been exposed to the virus.
   The major cause of transmission in the health care industry is
accidentally puncturing the skin with a needle or other sharp
instrument contaminated with infected blood, said Dr. Wayne
Thomann, director of Environmental Safety and Hospital Epidemiology
at Duke University Medical Center.
   Contact with the HIV virus doesn't necessarily mean a person
will become infected, however. Studies show the chance of a health
care worker being infected with the AIDS virus is 1 in 200, Ms.
Bartlett said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is gearing
up for a trip to the Middle East in June in another effort to
promote Arab-Israeli peace talks, a U.S. official said Friday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a final
decision to make the trip is likely next week. Shultz would make
stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria, hoping to open
negotiations over Palestinian self-rule and then on an overall
Mideast settlement.
   He would fly to the Middle East at the windup of the Moscow
summit meeting June 2 and then attend a meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's foreign ministers in Madrid June
9-10, the official said.
   Two trips by Shultz to the Middle East this year failed to
produce peace talks, but the secretary refuses to give up. ``Who's
afraid to struggle against odds?,'' he said at the end of the last
venture in April. ``What am I saving myself for, anyway?''
   He also suggested that Arabs and Israelis, despite their public
lack of enthusiasm for negotiations, had privately urged him to
keep trying.
   Shultz's first goal is a peace conference that would sponsor,
but not steer, negotiations to provide some form of self-rule for
the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held West
Bank and in Gaza.
   The secretary told a Senate appropriations subcommittee last
week that ``under the right circumstances'' King Hussein of Jordan
would be agreeable. However, he also testified that Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir had made the conference the ``centerpiece''
of his objections to Shultz's plan.
   Shultz also was unsuccessful last month in Moscow in trying to
persuade the Soviet Union to accept a limited role in the
negotiations.
   Shamir _ and Shultz _ are unwilling to give the Soviets an
opportunity to shape the outline of an Arab-Israeli settlement. But
Hussein is insisting on Soviet involvement.
   On the other hand, Jordan is resisting negotiations with Israel
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost
during the 1967 Mideast war. Shultz has advised Hussein that was
not ``in the cards.'' But he backs the idea of Israel trading some
territory on the West Bank for peace and said the future of
Jerusalem should be decided in negotiations.
   Despite the long odds, Shultz said he did not think his plan was
``fated to failure.''
   Shultz's plan called for a peace conference in mid-April, the
opening of negotations on the Palestinians May 1 and a second stage
of talks on an overall settlement beginning Dec. 1.
   The first two deadlines have passed. Still, Shultz has said he
will keep trying to get negotiations started in the 8{ months that
remain to the Reagan administration in order to give the next
president a head start.

   The State Department on Friday added two

   In a ceremony attended by several hundred present and former
Foreign Service officers, Secretary of State George P. Shultz read

their lives ``heroes.''
   Buckley, a U.S. intelligence officer stationed in Lebanon, was

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
said Friday hefty pay raises for corporate executives should
inspire rank-and-file workers to be ambitious rather than envious.
   William S. Kanaga, the 1988-1989 chairman of the board of
directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was asked by reporters
at a luncheon what he thought of the fact that management salaries
have been increasing at a faster rate than the pay of lower-ranking
workers.
   He replied that he was reminded of a story told by Walt Frazier,
a former star for the New York Knicks basketball team.
   ``Frazier was asked, `What are you doing for the black race?'.
... He replied, `I drive my Rolls Royce through Harlem every Sunday
and if that won't motivate them, I don't know what will,''' Kanaga
said.
   Asked if it was healthy for executives, figuratively speaking,
to flaunt their Rolls Royces in front of workers, he said, ``One of
the beauties of the free enterprise system we have is if a fellow
wants to go down a certain avenue, he can make a lot of money.''
   He said Frazier's Rolls Royce ``may have driven some fellows
back to the basketball courts up there.''
   Kanaga, who is chairman of the advisory board of Arthur Young &
Co,. an accounting firm, was asked if he believed athletics were
the only route out of the ghetto for young blacks.
   ``I'm not suggesting it is the only one, no. There are others,''
he replied, mentioning education.
   The value of incentives, he said, is illustrated by the supply
of taxicabs in Beijing before and after economic reforms in China.
Before the reforms, taxis were nearly impossible to find at dinner
time because drivers were paid a flat monthly salary. Now that the
drivers get to keep a part of the fare, cabs are plentiful, he said.
   Kanaga also said that higher managerial salary hikes when a
company succeeds must be balanced against the possibility that they
will be out of the job if their company's fortunes take a downturn.
   He said Chrysler Corp. workers are probably delighted, even
though they earned far less than Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca,
because of Iacocca's leadership in saving the company.

<HEAD>Bank Discounts Arson Rumors While Officials Call for Tougher Fire
Laws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fire that gutted four stories of
California's tallest skyscraper, killing one person and injuring
40, could have been prevented if City Council had done its duty 14
years ago, a lawmaker charged Friday.
   Meanwhile, First Interstate Bancorp officials discounted
speculation of arson prompted by fears of impending layoffs. City
fire officials had yet to determine the cause of the blaze at the
62-story First Interstate Bank tower.
   Councilman Nate Holden introduced a motion Friday to require all
high-rises to install sprinkler systems. A similar law that took
effect in 1974 did not apply to structures built before then. The
bank was built in 1973.
   Workers were installing a sprinkler system in the 859-foot
skyscraper when the fire _ the worst high-rise blaze in Los Angeles
history _ erupted late Wednesday.
   ``If you had done your duty in 1974, we wouldn't be here
today,'' charged Holden, who was elected last year.
   The motion was given little discussion because it was not on the
agenda. It was put on Tuesday's agenda.
   City officials said as many as two-thirds of the city's 765
skyscrapers lack sprinklers that could prevent fire catastophes.
   A First Interstate spokesman discounted arson speculation
prompted by news that the company's capital markets group was sold
in a deal that closed Wednesday night. The group employs 100 people
on the floor where the fire apparently broke out.
   Spokesman John Popovich said the sale was consummated after the
close of business and kept secret from workers until Thursday
morning, after the fire. Further, the bank had announced its
intention to sell the group, which buys and sells government bonds,
in October.
   ``I firmly believe that at this stage it's random chance,''
Popovich said of the timing of the sale and fire. ``If the idea is
that there is a disgruntled employee, that would have been six
months ago.''
   Printon, Kane & Co. of Short Hills, N.J., which bought the group
for $40 million, plans no layoffs or moves, said Robert Grimmig,
managing partner of the firm.
   The blaze that gutted the 12th through 15th stories and damaged
part of the 16th floor of the skyscraper, causing $450 million in
damage. A maintenance engineer was killed and 40 people were
injured.
   Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
were also investigating.
   Consumer services, including checking, savings and automatic
teller machines in the 19 states where First Interstate does
business continued except at the tower branch.
   Securities trading and electronic funds transfers from other
institutions continued smoothly, largely because the bank had
recently developed an emergency plan for use in an earthquake,
Popovich said.

   American and British convoys sailed
parallel courses down the Persian Gulf on Friday, with helicopters
scouting ahead for mines.
   Observers who saw the two convoys 30 miles off Dubai at midday
said the British group was made up of five tankers escorted by the
Royal Navy's 4,100-ton destroyer Gloucester.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English said the American
guided-missile frigate Jack Williams was escorting the U.S.-flag
79,999-ton Kuwaiti products tankers Chesapeake City and Ocean City
and had picked up a ``hitchhiker,'' the Liberian-flagged tanker
Neston.
   Other ships often follow those protected by warships through the
Strait of Hormuz, the narrow gateway to the gulf where Iranian
gunboats often attack unescorted ships. A total of about 500 ships
have been attacked by Iran and Iraq since the countries went to war
in September 1980.
   The U.S. convoy was the 29th of this year and the fourth in a
week. The convoys were disrupted last month by a confrontation
April 18 between U.S. and Iranian forces, in which two Iranian oil
platforms and six naval craft were destroyed or damaged.
   Gulf-based shipping executives and Pentagon officials in
Washington, all speaking on condition they not be named, reported
earlier that Iran's fleet of armed speedboats was increasing in
size and activity around the Hormuz naval base at Bandar Abbas, but
the reason was not known.
   Iran has said it will avenge its losses and Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during
a visit to the region that the threat could not be dimissed.
   Officers on the 3,700-ton Jack Williams were said to be more
concerned about mines than the reports of armed speedboats. The
Williams played a key role in the U.S.-Iran clash and was one of
three U.S. ships that came under Iranian missile fire near Hormuz.
   ``It could be anything. Who knows what they're up to?'' one
officer said, according to a report filed from the ship by a
Pentagon news media pool.
   Lookouts posted on the frigate's bow scanned the waters with
binoculars, looking for ``floaters,'' as the helicopters searched
farther ahead. Submerged mines sometimes can be seen from the air.
   Last month, the Jack Williams passed unscathed through an area
of the central gulf less than a day before its sister frigate
Samuel B. Roberts sailed into a field of newly laid mines and hit
one. Ten crewmen were wounded.
   Friday's convoy was the first to negotiate the 110-mile Hormuz
passage since Washington announced a new policy that allows U.S.
warships to intervene in Iranian attacks on commercial ships
bearing other flags.
   The policy applies to any ship in international waters and not
carrying war-related cargo for Iraq or Iran. Previously, U.S.
warships could defend only vessels flying the American flag.
   Since the U.S. Navy began escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers
last July, none of the 51 convoys has been molested by Iran's
surface raiders.
   Iran condemned the new U.S. policy as ``aggression'' and
promised to continue raids on shipping.

<HEAD>Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rates Up for First Time Since Stock Market
Crash</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fixed-rate home mortgages, after falling since
the October stock market crash, headed higher in April, the
government said Friday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates savings
institutions, said its nationwide average for conventional 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages on single family homes rose to 10.48 percent
in early April, up from 10.33 percent in March.
   It was the first increase in the bank board's monthly average
since October. Interest rates began falling after the stock market
crash as the Federal Reserve Board pumped money into the economy to
guard against a recession.
   Market analysts believe the Fed tightened the money supply in
March, pushing rates higher, as it shifted its emphasis from
recession-fighting to dampening fears of inflation.
   The bank board survey said rates for the most popular type of
one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, those with limits on how much
the rate can increase, dropped slightly from 8.64 percent in March
to 8.62 percent in April.
   It was the first time in six months that the spread between
rates for the two types of mortgages has widened. However, the
April margin of 1.86 percent was still much smaller than the record
2.42 percent gap in October.
   ``Interest rates are on the rise once again, particularly for
fixed-rate mortgages,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice president
of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. ``This reflects a
general uptrend over the past few weeks in the bond markets and
renewed fears of inflation.''
   The bank board ``numbers really reflect the world of a month ago
and since then rates have gone still higher,'' he said, adding that
the April unemployment report, showing the jobless rate dropping to
5.4 percent for the first time since 1974, will fan inflation fears
and ``is only going to make things worse.''
   However, Lasko said, ``We don't think this rise in rates will
throttle home-buying. If anything, it will cause people to buy
sooner to take advantage of rates while they are still attractive.''
   According to a separate weekly report by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., 30-year, fixed-term rates rose this week to 10.32
percent, up from 10.28 percent a week ago. Those averages are lower
than the bank board's because they do not include add-on fees,
known as points, which are paid by borrowers.
   The bank board also said the share of mortgage loans with
adjustable rates fell below 50 percent for the first time since
last July. The adjustable-rate share, which peaked at 69 percent in
December, fell from 54 percent in March to 48 percent in April.
   Lasko said he expected that trend to reverse as the gap widens
between fixed and adjustable rates.

<TEXT>
   A Brownie troop's hopes of sending
Girl Scout cookies to U.S. sailors have been snarled in red tape
because of a half-baked $2,000 Japanese import tax slapped on the
goodies, a troop leader said Friday.
   The 402 boxes of Thin Mints, Golden Yangles, Scot Ts, Savannahs,
Jubilees, Classic Cremes and Hoedowns are piled up at the Corpus
Christi International Airport while officials try to figure out how
to get them to their destination.
   ``We thought there would be a small import fee, but not this
much,'' groused Marchetta White, leader of Brownie Troop 807 in
nearby Beeville.
   The 18 girls in the troop sold the cookies to crew members of
the USS Midway, berthed in Atsugi, Japan, and were eagerly awaiting
letters from the servicemen who bought them, Mrs. White said.
   American Airlines shipped the cookies April 26 to Japan without
charge. However, when Japanese customs officials demanded a $2,000
import tax, the boxes sat in a customs warehouse for four days
before being returned to Corpus Christi. They have been in storage
in one of the airline's offices this week.
   The troop's top cookie seller, 8-year-old Nickelle Clark, said
she did not like how the plan crumbled.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' she said. ``I'm mad.''
   Jean Titus, general manager for the airline in Corpus Christi,
said it probably will fly the cookies to Honolulu, where the Navy
will pick them up, but it could take several weeks for the shipment
to arrive.
   ``I'm quite sure that they will be leaving in the morning,'' she
added.
   Iso Mura, with the Department of Customs Inquiries in the
Japanese Embassy in Washington, said cookies would have a duty
equal to 24 percent of the item's value and its freight costs. He
said the $2,000 fee seemed high.
   ``It may be a mistake,'' Mura said.
   The cookie crisis even got Sen. Lloyd Bentsen involved. The
Texas Democrat has been working through diplomatic channels since
Thursday ``to get those cookies on the way to the sailors on the
Midway,'' a spokesman said.
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokesman Curtis Coker said
that if the situation were reversed, ``we would let it go right
through to the Japanese in their ship or at their base. You have to
apply a bit of common sense in regulating the food supply.''
   Mrs. White said that she chose the Midway because her son-in-law
is stationed on the ship, and that the Brownies have been
corresponding with the crew since they sent Christmas cards to the
sailors last year.
   Girl Scout leaders have not told all of the first-, second- and
third-graders that their cookie scheme met an international barrier.
   ``They decided at this point, since the cookies are going to get
to the sailors, they didn't want to complicate the Brownies'
lives,'' said Ann Diaz, executive director of the Paisano Girl
Scout Council in southern Texas.
   However, some of the girls' parents have told them about the
detained cookies.
   ``Some of the younger ones weren't real comprehending about what
happened, and the older ones do understand and are a little
disappointed the guys didn't get their cookies,'' Mrs. White said.
   Next time, she vowed, they will go through the military or the
mail.

<HEAD>Damage Over $100 Million, Residents Nervous About Plant Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Damage estimates topped $100 million
Friday from explosions that demolished a rocket fuel plant, while
city officials tried to calm residents by meeting with a
neighboring company making the same product.
   ``We've created a monster of fear,'' said City Councilman
Michael Harris. ``I don't think anybody other than maybe some of
those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard
inside.''
   Union officers, meanwhile, huddled to review safety records of
Pacific Engineering and Production Co., where a 1982 union letter
wondered why the plant hadn't already been ``blown off the face of
the earth.''
   Jim Barnes, state industrial relations director, said Pacific
underwent 11 inspections by the state Occupational Safety and
Health Division over the last five years.
   The inspections resulted in 10 citations as well as four fines
for incidents Barnes termed serious.
   ``There have been problems from time to time, mostly minor,'' he
said. ``Our opinion is that overall there record has been a good,
moderate record.''
   Executives of Kerr-McGee Corp., which manufactures the same
ammonium perchlorate a mile from the earthquake-force blast that
leveled Pacific, met with city officials amid calls from frightened
residents to shut the second plant down.
   ``It's too early to say we're going to run Kerr-McGee out of
town,'' said Harris. ``We have to wait and find out what caused
this. It may create a tremendous war out here.''
   Kerr-McGee voluntarily shut down Thursday.
   ``We will not resume until we're absolutely certain it's safe,''
said Kerr-McGee spokesman Paul Reed. ``But we've been operating 35
years without any sort of accident. We think our plant safety
record is exemplary.''
   Two Pacific executives were killed and 326 people were treated
at hospitals for injuries in Wednesday's blast, which threw houses
off their foundations and severely damaged buildings throughout the
city 10 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   Six people remained hospitalized, including a 5-day-old child
cut over the eye by flying glass in a hospital nursery.
   Nearly a third of the city's 16,000 homeowners filed damage
claims by Friday. City Manager Gary Bloomquist said initial damage
estimates topped $100 million.
   ``The number of claims already has really startled me,'' said
Bloomquist. ``But things are going real well. Practically
everything is running again and people are ordering new windows and
garage doors.''
   President Reagan was asked on Thursday to declare a disaster
area to qualify the city for federal grants.
   John Molovich, a United Steelworkers union safety and health
expert, flew to Henderson from Pittsburgh to meet with local union
officials. ``The reports we're getting is they've had problems with
fires of late,'' said Molovich.
   Molovich wrote a 1982 letter that questioned plant safety after
he took a tour. In the letter, he wrote of fears of an explosion
because of the chemicals used at the plant.
   ``The company moved on some of the items,'' Molovich said
Friday. ``I'm not saying they didn't do anything. But they moved on
the minor things, some of the major things were just not being
done.''
   This city of about 55,000 grew up around an industrial complex
that began during World War II with a plant that produced titanium
for warplanes. Growth here has been sharp in recent years, making
it the third-largest city in Nevada.
   Although Pacific has vowed to rebuild the plant within six
months, Bloomquist said it had better be someplace else.
   ``We don't have a facility big enough here to hold all the
protesters if they try and rebuild there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Justice Department Says No Further Review of Meese Allegations Is
Warranted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has found that no
further review is warranted of allegations against Attorney General
Edwin Meese III involving the bankruptcy of a computer software
firm doing business with the department, a spokesman said Friday.
   The department said in a letter that allegations by INSLAW
Inc.'s president, William Hamilton, provided no basis for an
independent counsel to look into the charges. The letter was sent
to Charles Work, Hamilton's attorney.
   The criminal division's acting chief, John Keeney, has
concluded, ``There's no need for an independent counsel to
investigate this matter,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry
Eastland.
   Meese is not under investigation by any section of the
department with regard to the INSLAW matter, said a department
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Among Hamilton's allegations was that Meese interceded to have
the company's former attorney, Leigh Ratiner, dismissed from the
Washington law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin. Hamilton
contends in court papers that Ratiner was asked to leave shortly
after Meese discussed the INSLAW case with one of his politically
connected law partners, Leonard Garment.
   Garment called the allegation involving Meese ``pure baloney''
but said he was questioned about the allegation two months ago by
the Justice Department's public integrity section.
   Hamilton said he had not yet seen the letter, adding that public
integrity investigators never interviewed him, his wife Nancy, nor
Ratiner.
   ``We are surprised they reached a conclusion without talking to
either the complaining witnesses or one of the victims,'' Hamilton
said.
   Under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, allegations must be
deemed to be specific and credible in order for a matter to be
referred to an independent counsel.
   Meese has been under criminal investigation since last May 11 by
independent counsel James C. McKay on other matters. McKay's office
had referred the INSLAW allegations about Meese to the Justice
Department's public integrity section to determine if they required
further investigation. If they had merited such further
investigation, the allegations would have been returned to the
independent counsel.
   INSLAW won a $6.8 million judgment against the Justice
Department from a federal bankruptcy judge who ruled that officials
used ``trickery, fraud and deceit'' to steal software the company
had developed under a $10 million government contract. The Justice
Department is appealing the ruling.
   The department's public integrity section is conducting an
investigation of possible perjury by government officials who
testified last year at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceeding involving
INSLAW, according to sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The perjury investigation stems from a ruling last year by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge George F. Bason Jr. that there had been an attempt
by Justice Department officials in 1985 to force INSLAW into
liquidation of its assets, which would have put the firm out of
business.
   The judge expressed disbelief in testimony given by two former
bankruptcy trustees and Thomas J. Stanton, head of the department's
Executive Office of U.S. Trustees.
   Stanton denied that he tried to pressure the trustees to convert
INSLAW's Chapter 11 reorganization into a Chapter 7 liquidation.
Bason found Stanton's testimony ``utterly incredible and unworthy
of belief.''
   The judge also refused to believe the recantation of deposition
testimony by former U.S. trustee Cornelius Blackshear, that Stanton
had asked him to help liquidate INSLAW.
   Blackshear, now a federal bankruptcy judge in New York City,
signed an affidavit recanting the sworn statements a day after he
gave the deposition in his chambers. He said he had confused the
INSLAW case with another bankruptcy matter.
   The Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, however, has
decided to conduct a full investigation of INSLAW's charges that it
was the victim of a vendetta by Justice Department officials to put
it out of business.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., decided last week to
conduct the investigation based on information compiled in a
preliminary inquiry, according to congressional sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Bason ruled last year that the Justice Department vendetta was
spearheaded by an official who administered INSLAW's contract. The
judge found that C. Madison Brewer was ``consumed by hatred and an
intense desire for revenge'' because he had been fired by INSLAW
before going to work at the Justice Department.
   Stanton agreed to help Brewer liquidate INSLAW to ``curry
favor'' with higher Justice Department officials, whose support he
needed to preserve the trustee's office, Bason said.

<HEAD>Reagan Meets Yugoslave Leader Vrhovec</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Yugoslav leader Josip
Vrhovec compared notes Friday on the Soviet Union and discussed
Yugoslav's economic problems in what the visitor called ``an
interesting exchange.''
   Vrhovec, a member of the non-aligned socialist country's
nine-member presidency, said the meeting with Reagan should provide
``new impetus to friendly development of our relations.''
   Yugoslavia supports U.S.-Soviet disarmament efforts and Vrhovec
told reporters he assured Reagan that his country supports efforts
to strengthen human rights and ``fight against all forms of
international terrorism.''
   The White House said the two ``discussed the Soviet Union'' and
its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, including Gorbachev's talks last
month in Belgrade and Reagan's three summit meetings with the
Soviet general-secretary.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said Reagan
congratulated Vrhovec on Yugoslavia's agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for a loan to support the country's
monetary and economic programs. Vrhovec summarized the terms to
Reagan, he said, and asked the president for continued U.S.
financial help.
   At IMF headquarters, where the loan has not yet been announced,
a spokesman said it was premature to release details of the amount
of credit or conditions Yugoslavia agreed to meet. Conditions often
include promises to reduce government subsidies, restructure prices
and devalue currency.
   Fitzwater quoted Reagan as saying that for Yugoslavia, the
United States ``would work with the Paris club to help out on other
financing as much as possible.'' ``Paris Club'' stands for wealthy
countries holding the debts of poorer nations which, after a debtor
meets IMF credit conditions, normally agree to extend the repayment
times.
   Yugoslavia has a $20 billion foreign debt and Europe's highest
inflation, 170 percent.
   The two leaders agreed that U.S.-Yugoslav economic relations are
developing ``in a very good way,'' and economic cooperation needs
to be upgraded and diversified, Vrhovec said.

   The yellow and white papal banners
that welcomed John Paul II last year were largely absent Friday on
the eve of the pope's second visit to South America's smallest
republic.
   And there were far fewer posters of the pontiff taped to
storefronts and home windows than before the March 1987 visit.
   ``His first visit here was cause for celebration. It brought out
those curious to see the pope, but this time nobody's quite as
excited. Perhaps the novelty is gone,'' taxi driver Arturo Branco
said.
   ``It's probably a bigger deal in the interior than it is in
Montevideo,'' said storekeeper Sara Beisso.
   The pope is scheduled to arrive Saturday at 5 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT)
in Uruguay's capital to begin a 12-day visit that includes stops in
Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay. It will be the pontiff's first trip to
landlocked Bolivia and Paraguay.
   During his South American visit last year, the pope met with
Chilean President Gen. Augusto Pinochet and caught a whiff of tear
gas during a clash between anti-Pinochet demonstrators and police
during an outdoor Mass.
   Among those the pontiff will meet during this trip are
Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner, a general in power since
1954, and Uruguay's president, Julio Sanguinetti, an agnostic.
   Uruguay, a country of 3 million, is considered the most
secularized nation in Latin America apart from Cuba. Uruguay has
permitted divorce and enforced separation of church and state since
1917.
   Church leaders say 80 percent of Uruguayans are Roman Catholic,
but studies indicate only 4 percent of Montevideo residents
regularly attend church. Montevideo accounts for almost half of
Uruguay's population.
   Regardless, 82,000 people are expected to hear the pope speak
Saturday night at Centenary Stadium shortly after his arrival at
Carrasco International Airport. He is scheduled to visit Catholic
University and spend the night at the Vatican envoy's residence.
   On Sunday morning, the pope is to fly to Melo, 250 miles
northeast near the Brazilian border. Authorities say up to 30,000
Brazilians are expected to cross the border to see him.
   He also is scheduled to have lunch with bishops from the
Uruguayan Episcopal Conference on Sunday and say Mass in Florida,
90 miles north of the capital.
   On Monday, the pope meets in the morning with President
Sanguinetti, then flies to the northwestern city of Salto, where
authorities expect up to 50,000 Argentines to cross the frontier to
hear him say Mass.
   The pope later leaves for Bolivia for a 5-day visit.
   The pontiff will spend a day and a half in Lima, Peru, which he
also visited in 1985, then fly to Asuncion, Paraguay, on May 16.
The pope will celebrate his 68th birthday on May 18 in Paraguay,
then leave that night for Rome.

   A British air force helicopter
taxiing during an air show burst into flames after one of its
rotors struck a loading ramp Friday. Two crewmen were killed and at
least seven people were seriously injured, officials said.
   Officials said ``numerous others'' suffered minor injuries from
flying debris in the accident at the Hanover Airport.
   A statement by the British Army of the Rhine said, ``We can
confirm that a Chinook Royal Air Force helicopter from Guetersloh
(air base) had a ground taxiing accident at Hanover Airport.'' It
said there were five British military personnel aboard the
U.S.-made Chinook helicopter and three survived but were injured.
   The Guetersloh base is 65 miles southwest of Hanover.
   Hanover Airport fire officials said at least four people near
the ramp were seriously injured.
   The ZDF television network said late Friday that at least 10
people were seriously injured, but it did not give attribution for
its account.
   ``It was like a bad dream, like a bomb went off,'' said Caren
Niewisch, 27, of Los Angeles, who had been watching the air show.
``People fell and tried to get away,'' she said. With her was
Marcus Fontaine, also of Los Angeles, who said he is a pilot.
   ``It wasn't the pilot's fault,'' Fontaine said. ``The man on the
ground (directing the helicopter) underestimated the radius of the
rotor blades in the turn.'' Neither Californian was injured.
   A British soldier who was guiding the helicopter to its parking
position with hand signals was among those seriously injured, the
Royal Air Force statement said.
   The twin-rotor helicopter flipped over onto one side before
bursting into flames. There were several explosions and flames shot
more than 25 feet into the air.
   British military officials said a board of inquiry was set up to
investigte the cause.
   Initial reports had said the helicopter belonged to the U.S.
military, but airport officials later said it was a U.S.-made
helicopter flown by the British military.
   The accident occurred at about 6 p.m. (12 noon EDT) shortly
after the air show's activities for the day had ended, officials
said.
   Witnesses said crowds of people were milling about the aircraft
exhibits at the time.
   It took fire crews more than 30 minutes to extinguish the fire.
   More than 420 exhibitors from 16 countries are participating in
the air show, which opened Wednesday.

   A woman whose 9-year-old daughter lost
her lower legs to frostbite after being trapped for days in an
unheated apartment pleaded guilty Friday to felony child neglect.
   Darlwin Britt, who has been held in the Lake County Jail since
her arrest Jan. 20, agreed to plead guilty to one count after
prosecutors said they would drop two other felony counts of child
neglect.
   Under the plea agreement, Ms. Britt, 25, would be sentenced to
14 years in prison. But Lake County Superior Court Judge Richard
Maroc said he has the option of suspending part of that sentence,
and will make a decision at a May 27 hearing.
   Ms. Britt took the stand only briefly during the 40-minute
hearing. She admitted that her daughter, Darlwin Carlisle, needed
medical attention, yet she did not seek it.
   Off the stand, Ms. Britt told Maroc that she was taking cocaine
during the time in January that young Darlwin was forced to live in
the unheated attic apartment. Otherwise, she gave no explanation
for the incident.
   Ms. Britt showed no emotion at the hearing, and Maroc did not
admonish her.
   The spunky youngster, described as a good student by her
teachers and ``very courageous'' by hospital personnel, now lives
with her great-grandmother in Gary. After her ordeal was publicized
nationwide, at least $125,000 poured in to help pay her medical
bills and future expenses.
   Darlwin has learned to skip rope and roller skate on her
artificial legs, therapists said at the time she was released from
a Chicago hospital.
   The little girl was found in a freezing apartment in Gary on
Jan. 18 by a construction worker who had been sent to board up the
building after a mortgage foreclosure.
   At the time, Jeff Griffin said he heard a child pleading for
help, removed a refrigerator from the top of the stairway and
kicked open a padlocked door to rescue the girl.
   Prosecutors said she had been without food or water for three to
five days.
   Doctors at Chicago's Wyler Children's Hospital said her lower
legs could not be saved. Darlwin was fitted with artificial legs at
La Rabida Children's Hospital, also in Chicago, where she also
received therapy.
   The Rev. Cozetta Olive of First AME Church in Gary said she read
about Ms. Britt's arrest in January and has visited her weekly at
the county jail.
   ``She is very refreshed but despondent,'' Olive said outside the
courtroom. ``She loves her daughter and that needs to be
understood. She's just happy the child is alive. She believes God
has answered her prayers, but she knows that she has done wrong.''
   Lake County Prosecutor Jack Crawford said young Darlwin has not
visited her mother, adding, ``interestingly, she has not indicated
that she wants to.''
   ``It's a strange case,'' Crawford said. ``Ms. Britt would come
back to the apartment and visit her daughter but not spend the
night. Instead she was hanging out on the streets.''
   Crawford said electricity, heat and water had been turned off at
the building late last summer.
   Olive said Ms. Britt told her that she had left young Darlwin
unattended so she could go find money to buy food and water.

   A French spy convicted in the sinking of the
Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior and the death of a photographer on
board was freed from her island exile Friday because she is
pregnant, Premier Jacques Chirac said.
   Capt. Dominique Prieur's departure from Hao, a French military
base, came about five months after the other agent convicted in the
incident, Maj. Alain Mafart, was returned to Paris. Mafart had
complained of a stomach ailment.
   Mrs. Prieur's release also came two days before a presidential
election that pits Chirac, a conservative, against Francois
Mitterrand, the Socialist incumbent and heavy favorite.
   The newspaper Le Monde said: ``You can't make us believe that
the captain's condition demands that her situation be arranged 48
hours before the elections.''
   Destruction of the protest ship in July 1985 at its berth in
Auckland, New Zealand, was a fiasco for the French secret service.
It was a dark hour for the Mitterrand administration but the
agents, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, were heroes at home.
   Defense Minister Andre Giraud greeted Mrs. Prieur and her
husband Joel when they arrived late Friday night at Villacoublay
military airport near Paris. The couple left without making any
comment to reporters. Prieur, a Defense Department employee, was
posted to Hao after his wife was exiled there.
   Mrs. Prieur, 38, and Mafart, 37, were arrested after explosives
attached to the hull sank the Rainbow Warrior, which was preparing
to sail to the French nuclear test site in the South Pacific. A
Greenpeace photographer was killed.
   They were sentenced to 10 years each in a New Zealand prison but
under an accord reached by the United Nations in 1986 were to
remain on Hao for three years.
   Prime Minister David Lange of New Zealand said freeing Mrs.
Prieur is a ``breach of France's obligation under international
law.''
   Chirac told a campaign luncheon in Agen: ``Mrs. Prieur is now
pregnant, and the accord foresaw that, in this circumstance, she
should be returned to Paris. I respect my signature. ... when I
sign an accord, it should be known that I respect it.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said an illness in Mrs. Prieur's
family ``accelerated'' the release.
   Louis Maire, Mrs. Prieur's father, is hospitalized with an
unspecified illness. He told Monte Carlo radio he had not known of
his daughter's return, but ``I'm very sick so it will be a pleasure
to see her before dying.''
   Lange said in a statement that her departure from Hao ``is not
consented to'' and he will pursue the matter with France next week.
   At the United Nations in New York, French Ambassador
Pierre-Louis Blanc met with Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to discuss the circumstances surrounding Friday's
repatriation.
   Benedicte Scalabre, a press attache to the French U.N. mission,
called it ``just an informational meeting.'' He refused comment on
whether pregnancy was a condition for repatriation under the U.N.
agreement.
   A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said the government
learned of the pregnancy several days ago.
   ``The New Zealand government was immediately informed and at the
same time invited to proceed with a medical examination,'' the
spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with French
practice.
   The newspaper Le Monde said Mrs. Prieur's baby is expected early
next year.
   Lange denounced Mafart's return to France in December and on
March 31, at New Zealand's request, a Dutch diplomat was sent to
Hao to make sure Mrs. Prieur was still there.
   The New Zealand government has has tried unsuccessfully to force
the return of Mafart, who has completed entrance examinations for a
French war college since arriving in France.
   Chirac's announcement of Mrs. Prieur's release came a day after
three French hostages were freed in Lebanon and 23 hostages held by
separatists in New Caledonia were rescued from a cave in a surprise
assault by security forces.
   There was speculation those events were timed to coincide with
the French election.
   The Rainbow Warrier bombing occurred while a Socialist
government was in power. Defense Minister Charles Hernu resigned
and the intelligence chief was dismissed, but polls indicated the
French people were less concerned about the bombing than the
bungling of the operation.

<HEAD>Three Church Appointments Expected In June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two auxiliary Roman Catholic
bishops and an apostolic administrator will be appointed in June as
a step toward improved relations with the communist government,
church sources said Friday.
   The disclosure came after two Vatican envoys, Archbishop
Francesco Colasuonno and the Rev. John Bukowski, visited Prague for
talks with Vladimir Janku, head of the state office for church
affairs. No details of the talks were reported.
   Both auxiliary bishops will serve under Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek of Prague, the 88-year-old Catholic primate, and the
apostolic administrator will be assigned to Trnava in Slovakia.
Apostolic administrators are considered titular bishops, ranking
below full bishops.
   No names have been disclosed but church sources said privately
the nominees were expected to be Jan Lebeda and Antonin Liska as
auxiliary bishops and Jan Sokol as the apostolic administrator.
   They said the auxiliary bishops probably would be ordained June
11 and the Trnava appointee June 12, by a Vatican delegation led by
Cardinal Achille Silvestrini.
   Ten of Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses still will not have full
bishops. No new bishops have been appointed since 1973 and the
remaining three are over age 75.
   Janku was quoted Thursday by the youth daily Mlada Fronta as
saying the government seeks ``earnest solutions to disputed
questions'' with the Vatican.
   His statement was seen as evidence of better relations with the
Holy See, which have been strained by religious activism and
disputes over choosing bishops.
   The Vatican refuses to accept candidates from the
state-sponsored clergy association Pacem in Terris, which the
Vatican does not recognize.
   In the interview, Janku said: ``In principle we have already
reached agreement on criteria for the selection of bishops.
   ``The Vatican has three requirements: faithfulness to the
church, capability of pastoral care and moral purity. ... We have a
fourth requirement: He should be a man loyal to the state.''

   Nearly 60,000 Cuban agricultural workers will
get wage increases of 20-30 percent during the summer months to
increase the food supply, Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency said
Friday.
   The report received in Mexico City said the decision was made by
the State Committee of Labor and Social Security and the increases
would be for the months of June, July and August when manual farm
work is heaviest.
   Prensa Latina said the measure's purpose is to increase the
harvest of vegetables and other foodstuffs during the summer
because of difficult weather conditions later in the year.
   It said the increases for Agriculture Ministry workers in
grains, vegetables and citrus fruits will be 30 percent in the city
of Havana and surrounding Havana province and 20 percent elsewhere
in Cuba.

   Three Bible-thumping children of a street
preacher have been suspended from school a third time in two weeks
for preaching outside instead of entering the building on time, the
principal said Friday.
   Jim Gost suspended 5-year-old Matthew Strode for 10 days
Thursday. He also suspended Matthew's 6-year-old sister, Pepper,
and gave their 10-year-old brother, Duffey, his third suspension on
Friday.
   Gorst said the Strode children were disciplined for failing to
enter the building as required in school rules, not for their
preaching.
   The school handbook says students must enter when they arrive at
school at 7:30 a.m., but the three insisted on preaching loudly
outside until 7:45 a.m.
   Their parents insist that is their children's right under the
First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and religion. The
children were first suspended April 23.
   ``I hope the Lord takes every last one of them and does
something to them. They ain't nothing but a bunch of hypocrites,''
Robin Strode, the children's mother, said after a meeting with the
principal.
   ``Other kids break rules that are in the handbook, and they
don't get suspended,'' Mrs. Strode said. ``They smoke cigarettes
both on and off campus. They use those four-letter words. They get
into fights, and nothing gets done to them.''
   Gorst said he has tried reasoning with Mrs. Strode and her
husband, David, a street preacher since 1981, but ``we just did not
seem to make any headway.''
   On Thursday morning, Pepper stood quietly with Matthew behind
the school's rear entrance while Matthew and Duffey alternately
shouted Bible verses. Duffey stood in the road outside the school
gate, 100 yards away.
   ``You're in violation of school rules by being out here,'' Gorst
told Matthew and Pepper.
   ``Woe unto you, scribes and pharisees,'' yelled Duffey from the
gate.
   ``Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled. But
whoremongers and adulterers God will judge,'' Matthew replied.
   Procedures call for expulsion from school if a student is
suspended four times within a school year.

   An intensifying storm system moved through Wyoming on Friday,
spawning snow, thunderstorms, hail and high winds from Montana and
North Dakota into New Mexico.
   Snow fell in northern Nevada, where 9 inches had accumulated by
noon in Austin, 8 at Jackpot and 4 to 5 at Mountain City. A winter
storm watch was issued for Friday night and Saturday in the
mountains of central Montana.
   Heavy thunderstorms deluged western North Dakota and central
Nebraska. Alliance, Neb., received half-inch hail.
   Rain or snow, most of the West was buffeted by high winds. A
gust of 85 mph was clocked at the Arapahoe Baskin Ski Area in
Colorado. Just west of Colorado Springs, wind blew down a major
transmission line and cut off power to 9,000 utility customers.
Gusts of 63 mph were reported in Montrose and Gunnison, Colo.
   Rock Springs and Casper, Wyo., Milford, Utah, and Ruidoseo,
N.M., clocked gusts of more than 50 mph.
   The winds stirred up dust and limited visibility in eastern
North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota.
   Elsewhere, cool and rainy weather continued in the Middle
Atlantic states and southern New England. A flood warning was
issued for central and western Maryland, northern Virginia and
northeastern West Virginia.
   Temperatures were in the 80s along the Gulf Coast and across
much of Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Hailey, Idaho, and Elko, Nev., to 90 at Carlsbad, N.M.
The morning low for the nation was 20 at Truckee, Calif.
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
extending from Arkansas across the upper half of the Mississippi
Valley, the northern Plains, the northern Rockies and the
intermountain west to northern California and the Pacific
Northwest. Snow is predicted for the higher elevations from Montana
to Nevada.
   Highs should range in the 40s and 50s over the intermountain
west and the northern Rockies. Highs should hit the 80s from the
South Atlantic States across the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys
and the lower two-thirds of the Mississippi Valley to the Southern
Great Plains. Texas' Rio Grande region might get highs in the 90s,
with temperatures in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.

   Provincial councils in the
Tamil-dominated Northern and Eastern provinces will not be elected
until the end of the officially declared emergency in the region,
the government said Friday.
   President Junius Jayewardene's government imposed emergency rule
in 1983 after separatists in the Tamil minority began a war against
the Sinhalese majority. More than 7,000 people have been killed in
the conflict.
   ``The nomination of candidates for the purposes of elections to
be held in the Northern and Eastern provinces shall not take place
so long as the provisions of the Public Security Ordinance are
effective,'' a government statement said.
   Elections for four of the nine provincial councils were held
last week and Jayewardene's United National Party won majorities.
The other three councils are to be elected next month.
   Provincial councils are part of an Indian-sponsored peace plan
designed to give greater autonomy to the provinces. The plan also
requires the rebels to surrender their arms in exchange for
participation in local government, but they rejected the plan and
violence has continued.
   India, which has a Tamil minority of 60 million, has sent more
than 50,000 soldiers to disarm the militants in this island off
India's southern coast.
   In Sri Lanka's Southern province, Sinhalese extremists have
sworn to kill supporters of the peace plan, which they say makes
too many concessions to Tamils.
   They also oppose the council elections and the underground
People's Liberation Front was blamed for the killings Wednesday of
three candidates.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese.

   A tentative contract covering 66,000
Chrysler Corp. employees in 15 states was approved by the United
Auto Workers' 140-member national Chrysler council Friday and goes
next to the rank and file.
   ``We believe it will be ratified overwhelmingly,'' said UAW Vice
President Marc Stepp, head of the union's Chrysler department.
   The two-year, job-protecting contract reached Wednesday would
replace a three-year pact that runs out Sept. 14. In 1990, all Big
Three contracts will expire together for the first time in a
decade, boosting the UAW's bargaining power.
   The Chrysler council approved the pact after a 5{-hour meeting.
A provision giving full Chrysler seniority to former American
Motors Corp. workers in 1990 was deleted by the council before it
gave its approval. GM acquired AMC last year.
   The contract, which also covers 65,000 retirees at the No. 3
automaker, will be presented to union members for ratification on
Wednesday.
   It is patterned on the contracts in place at Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors for the first time since 1979, when the UAW granted
Chrysler deep concessions to help rescue the automaker from near
bankruptcy.
   The contract prevents further plant closings and layoffs for any
reason other than slow sales, halves the attrition rate and
restricts the automaker's ability to transfer work to outside
suppliers or foreign countries.
   It also contains lump-sum bonuses equal to 3 percent of wages
each year and provides profit-sharing to Chrysler workers for the
first time.
   ``It should pass. The job security is there, that was the most
important issue,'' said Mike Allen, a union official with UAW Local
624 in Syracuse, N.Y.
   Stepp said the settlement and approval by the council had
brought to an end months of bitter conflict that led the two sides
to seek a solution by holding early contract talks. ``There's peace
in the valley,'' he said.
   Unlike the Ford and GM agreements, the Chrysler pact includes a
$1,000 signing bonus and prevents Chrysler from paying executives
cash or stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula
generates no payout for workers.
   In addition, it covers 1,200 former AMC workers still on the job
in Wisconsin after a 5,500-worker AMC assembly plant in Kenosha,
Wis., closes at year's end.

   When Fay Walker's four children
were growing up, she always answered demands for fancy clothes or
toys the same way: ``Oh no, not until I get my pink Cadillac
convertible.''
   Well, last week Mrs. Walker turned 60 and graduated from
college, and you can guess what her children gave her.
   After receiving her political science degree, she returned to
the parking lot with her husband, Chuck. Family and friends were
waiting.
   As she approached, the group parted. Behind them, loaded up with
eight of her 10 grandchildren, was a refurbished, 1973, pearly pink
Cadillac Eldorado convertible _ the top down, of course.
   Blasting from the cassette player was Aretha Franklin's
``Freeway of Love,'' in which she sings of riding in a pink
Cadillac.
   ``I was in total shock,'' Mrs. Walker said. ``My kids really
pulled one. I don't know what I said. Everybody on campus at JU
(Jacksonville University) knew they were doing this and they were
all watching.
   ``The kids gave me a whole list of things they're telling me
they've been waiting for me to do for years, now that I've got the
pink Cadillac,'' she said.
   ``I'm afraid to look at the list.''
   Mrs. Walker had started college in 1945, but marriage
interrupted her education. She returned to school when son Andy
went to college seven years ago, but there were other interruptions
as she helped out when grandchildren were born.
   Finally, graduation loomed.
   Son Jef, 37, ``said it would really be neat if we could find an
old Cadillac and paint it pink, and then we immediately dismissed
the idea,'' said son Tim Walker, 35, of Jacksonville.
   ``But then we all started looking around in garage sales and car
lots in Orlando and Jacksonville.''
   Andy Walker, 25, found the Caddy the sons and daughter Celia
James, 33, of Tampa, bought for $800 in February. It was white and
it ran, but it needed work and paint. The family chipped in, with a
son-in-law providing mechanical work, Tim taking care of the paint
and others helping sand the car.

   Seven dissident Contra field commanders detained
and expelled from Honduras arrived here Friday blaming their
military chief for their plight and pledging to seek total reform
of Nicaragua's rebel forces.
   The men were arrested without explanation in Honduras, held for
three days and put on a plane to Miami on Friday, they said here.
   The seven included military field commanders and top civilian
aides who had called for the removal of Contra military chief Col.
Enrique Bermudez.
   They have accused Bermudez of corruption and charged that he has
surrounded himself with supporters of deposed Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
   One of the dissidents, Donald Lacayo, a legal adviser to the
rebel military, said the seven were expelled because they presented
Contra leaders with a petition demanding that Bermudez go.
   ``There is a total rejection of him by all the combatants,''
Lacayo said.
   The dissidents will go to the Contras' Miami headquarters next
week to demand a total restructuring of the rebel military, said
Lacayo.
   Field commander Walter Calderon Lopez, known as Cmdr. Tono, said
Bermudez was also trying to undermine the cease-fire agreement
signed March 23 in Sapoa, Nicaragua, by the Sandinistas and the
Contras.
   ``If Bermudez remains as head of the northern front, we will
never get back to Nicaragua,'' he said.
   The seven men said they had been well treated by the Hondurans
but were offered no explanation for their detention and expulsion.
Honduras has allowed the Contras to use the country as a staging
ground for attacks on the Sandinistas.
   Arriving with Lacayo and Tono were Enrique Sanchez; Orlando
Montealegre; Encarnacion Valdivia, who is known as Cmdr. Tigrillo;
Tirzo Roman Moreno, also known as Cmdr. Rigoberto, and Gustavo
Quezada.

   The French presidential campaign drew to a close
Friday with the country euphoric about the freeing of French
captives in Lebanon and New Caledonia but party loyalists arguing
over the timing of the releases.
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, favored to win a second
seven-year term in Sunday's runoff, capped his electioneering with
a final rally in the southern city of Toulouse. Campaigning is
prohibited Saturday.
   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac toured the south, basking in
the release in Beirut Wednesday of Marcel Fontaine, 45, Marcel
Carton, 62, and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, and in the freeing
Thursday of 23 French lawmen held by Melanesian separatists in New
Caledonia.
   The release from exile Friday of a French spy convicted in the
1985 sinking of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior increased the
recent dose of good news for Chirac.
   It wasn't clear how the hostage releases would affect Chirac's
chances in Sunday's runoff, because polls are forbidden in the
final week of the campaign. Most political analysts felt any
benefits would be insufficient to overcome the wide lead held by
Mitterrand in the final opinion surveys last week.
   The last polls indicated Mitterrand was favored by 53 percent to
57 percent of voters, compared to Chirac's 43 percent to 47 percent
rating. The men advanced to the runoff by being the top two
vote-getters in the first round of voting April 24.
   In that vote, Mitterrand won 34.1 percent of the vote and Chirac
won 19.9 percent.
   Attempts to keep partisan presidential politics out of the
celebration of the hostage releases lasted less than a day.
   Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party, claimed
Chirac pushed for the releases to bolster his own campaign.
``Jacques Chirac and his team is working public opinion with force
in a formidable attempt to manipulate the end of the campaign,'' he
said Friday.
   But Jacques Toubon, secretary-general of Chirac's Rally for the
Republic party, denounced what he called the ``wet blankets, the
grumblers who split hairs when they should simply be happy.''
   ``An objective fact: with the government of Jacques Chirac, when
there are hostages, they are freed,'' he added. ``For order,
liberty and security, Jacques Chirac and his government are very
effective.''
   In Paris' central Place de la Concorde, 40,000 Chirac backers
gathered for a final outpouring of support.
   ``We have 36 hours left to convinced the undecided,'' Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua told the crowd.
   ``France needs a president who decides,'' he said. ``When it was
necessary to decide for the liberation of hostages in Lebanon,
Chirac knew how to decide. When it was necessary to decide to free
the hostages in New Caledonia, Chirac knew how to decide.''
   Chirac rejected allegations that his actions were motivated by
the elections. He said it was ``my duty to do everything possible,
even if it could lead to critical comments, to get the last
(French) hostages out of Lebanon.''
   Mitterrand himself welcomed the hostage releases and made no
insinuations about his opponent.
   On Thursday morning, French security forces stormed a cave in
the French island territory of New Caledonia, freeing 23 hostages.
Two assault team members and 19 Melanesian separatist kidnappers
were killed.
   On Friday, the government announced that Capt. Dominique Prieur,
one of two French agents convicted in New Zealand of the 1985
bombing of an anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship, had been allowed to
leave her island exile for France. Chirac said she was freed
because she is pregnant.
   She and the other agent, who has already returned to France,
were convicted of manslaughter. A photographer aboard the Rainbow
Warrier had been killed.
   The left-leaning newspaper Le Monde questioned the coincidence
of the release of the hostages in Lebanon four days before the
election.
   ``Would it be dignified and honorable under these conditions to
accept that the terrorists interfere in French political life, that
they influence in one way or another the French people's choice of
a president?''
   The newspaper also questioned the assault on the New Caledonian
island of Ouvea.
   ``If these events leave a bitter taste, it is because it is
difficult to resist the idea that someone was trying to get votes
in metropolitan France with blood in Ouvea. It is difficult to
resist the idea that in 48 hours, Mr. Chirac wanted to play
presidential poker,'' the paper said.
   Le Monde said it was difficult to believe that Mrs. Prieur's
condition required that she be repatriated just 48 hours before the
election.

   The Reagan administration is
misinforming the American public about efforts to resolve Panama's
political crisis, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said in an interview
Friday.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces and the power
behind the civilian government, has resisted U.S. pressure,
including economic sanctions, to resign.
   He said that Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, is ``damaging the Reagan administration''
and misinforming the U.S. public about any talks to resolve the
dispute.
   The general said he has held ``conversations,'' not
``negotiations,'' with ``southern and northern leaders'' and spoke
of what he called a positive proposal submitted by President
Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala. But he declined to give any details
about that proposal.
   Noriega agreed to the interview after he inaugurated a water
line to the community of Sajalices 45 miles southwest of Panama
City.
   He said Panama wanted a democracy ``in the image and likeness of
Panama and not of the United States. Leave us alone. Let them not
interfere with our tamoborito (a Panamanian folk dance) and we will
not interfere with their political rock and roll.''
   The Reagan administration wants ``docile governments'' in Latin
America instead of friendly ones that can be treated as equals, he
added.
   Noriega was indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida last
February on drug-trafficking charges, which he denies.
   The U.S. government imposed sanctions to force Noriega to resign
and leave Panama after the legislature controlled by the general
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle Feb. 26. That was the day
after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega.
   Banners in Sajalices read ``Welcome general,'' and Noriega shook
hands and chatted with people at the ceremony inaugurating the
three-mile pipeline.
   Noriega opened the water faucets at a soccer field and then
cupping his hands threw water at those around him. He kicked a
soccer ball to open an amateur league's season and spent nearly an
hour talking with residents.
   He claimed Abrams is ``disinforming the people of the United
States about conversations with Panama'' because Abrams' previous
advice to President Reagan ``has been a failure.''
   He said he has not refused to talk with U.S. repesentatives.
   ``But there are no negotiations,'' he said. ``We do not
negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate the dignity
of a man.''
   In recent days there had been reports in Washington that an
agreement has been reached that would have Noriega resign as chief
of the 15,000-member Defense Forces but remain in Panama.
   Noriega has denied there is such an agreement.

   Newspapers will survive and flourish if they
keep pace with the nation's changing lifestyles and growing
minority population, industry leaders said Friday.
   ``Doom-saying for newspapers is an old pastime, and it has been
booming in recent years,'' said Larry Jinks, senior vice president
for news and operations at Knight-Ridder Inc. ``We are, as an
industry, more clear-eyed about our problems and advantages, and
more determined to do what's necessary to flourish.''
   ``The future of newspapers is very bright, so long as we don't
take that future for granted,'' agreed Sam S. McKeel, chairman of
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., which publishes The Philadelphia
Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News. Both are Knight-Ridder
papers.
   Jinks, McKeel and others spoke at a conference held by Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism, which is celebrating
its 75th anniversary.
   Jinks said during a panel discussion on the future of newspapers
that industry concerns include competition, illiteracy, a transient
population and a dwindling attention span among those ``raised in
front of the tube.''
   ``It's been the change in social patterns _ leisure time,
working women, changes in family structure _ that probably have
caused more changes in newspapers than technology has,'' added
Anthony J. Marro, editor and senior vice president of Newsday.
   Mark C. Miller, associate editor of the Berkshire Eagle in
Massachusetts, said afternoon papers are giving way to morning
editions because readers don't have time to sit down at the end of
the day.
   ``Most households have a couple of people who are earning their
living outside the home,'' he noted. ``We're competing with all
sorts of leisure time activities ... cable satellites, VCRs, people
jogging around with things stuck in their ears.''
   Dorothy Gilliam, a Washington Post columnist, cited figures
showing that minorities will account for 25 percent to 40 percent
of the population by the turn of the century.
   ``It seems to me what is too often missing in newspapers is the
authentic voice of the different groups that make up our society
today and that will increasingly comprise our society in the
future,'' she said.
   Jinks agreed, saying, ``You can't have a bunch of middle-aged,
white males sit around in a news conference and decide what to put
in tomorrow's newspaper and have a newspaper that's going to appeal
to the whole, general population.''
   More than half the nation's newspapers have all-white reporting
staffs, and non-whites account for only 5 percent of the
decision-makers at newspapers, Gilliam said.

<HEAD>Canada Suspends Fishing War Talks Over Trawler Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada suspended talks with France on their
fishing war Friday, the day after a Newfoundland trawler was
stopped at sea and taken to a port on the French-held islands of
St. Pierre and Miquelon.
   Foreign Secretary Joe Clark summoned French Ambassador Philippe
Husson and made a formal protest of what John Crosbie, minister of
international trade, described in Parliament as a ``provocation by
France.''
   In St. Pierre, charges of illegal fishing were filed against the
trawler Maritimer, and its five crewmen were released after the
Canadian government posted bail of $35,000 ($28,350 U.S.).
   Opposition parties demanded that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Conservative government suspend negotiations with France for the
purchases of 10 nuclear-powered submarines and 34 European Airbus
jetliners.
   Clark said they wanted to start a ``casual trade war'' and
``there is no reason at this stage for us to contemplate that.''
   He called the trawler's interception by a French naval tug ``a
bizarre incident'' that could be resolved diplomatically.
   Mulroney, speaking to reporters in New Brunswick, promised
``vigorous action'' if the rights of Canadian citizens were
violated.
   French officials said the vessel was ``escorted into port,'' not
arrested, and the crew spent Thursday night at a hotel.
   In Newfoundland, provincial Premier Brian Peckford accused
France of infringing on Canadian sovereignty. His government
canceled a $729,000 (U.S.) offshore oil contract with a French
company and withdrew from a Paris food show scheduled for next fall.
   Clark said he had ordered talks suspended in the fishing
dispute. A Canadian negotiator had been scheduled to meet his
counterpart in Paris on Friday for discussions of fishing quotas in
the waters around St. Pierre and Miquelon, which are 10 miles south
of Newfoundland.
   Canada and France disagree over the international boundary of
the islands and quotas for cod and other fish in nearby waters.
France claims a 200-mile economic zone but Canada recognizes only a
12-mile limit around the islands.
   A French trawler, the Croix de Lorraine, was arrested last month
when it deliberately penetrated Canadian inshore waters to protest
fishing restrictions. All 21 men aboard, including four French
politicians, were jailed in St. John's, Newfoundland, until the
French government bailed them out.

   Police and soldiers seized more than
3,000 pounds of cocaine in a raid on a big drug-processing
laboratory, the army announced Friday.
   More than 15,000 pounds of cocaine have been confiscated during
the past week in raids on 13 laboratories in a ranching and farming
area about 225 miles north of Bogota.
   Officials said the raids have been the biggest blow against drug
trafficking in Colombia since cocaine production became big
business in the 1970s.
   An army release said the latest raid was at a farm near the town
of Puerto Berrio on Thursday and that police found 3,080 pounds of
98 percent pure cocaine hidden among trees near the end of a paved
runway. Officials estimated the value of the cocaine would be about
$100 million in the United States even before it entered the street
market.
   The army statement by Gen. Raul Humberto Rojas said troops are
searching for 25 additional cocaine laboratories believed to be in
the same area north of the capital.
   It said police and troops also seized thousands of gallons of
ether and other chemicals needed to process coca base into cocaine.
   ``This is the biggest operation ever carried out against drug
trafficking in Colombia and we will continue it until we have wiped
out the scourge,'' Gen. Guillermo Medina Sanchez, the national
police commander, told a news conference Thursday.

   Thousands of trucks were backed up Friday at
Italian crossing points on the borders with France, Switzerland,
Austria and Yugoslavia as Italian customs officers refused to work
overtime.
   A meeting between union and government oficials failed to
resolve the dispute. Further talks were scheduled for Tuesday.
   Hundreds of truck drivers blocked the Milan_Chiasso highway on
the Italian-Swiss border to protest delays in clearing freight
documents.
   Police reported thousands of trucks lined up at other crossings
and said automobile traffic was badly delayed.
   About 5,000 customs officers are refusing to examine freight
documents after the end of their regular work hours at 2 p.m. to
press their demands for pay increases and a reorganization of the
customs system.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels on Friday
announced an end to a ban on transportation that had drastically
curtailed traffic during the week.
   ``The national strike of transportation ends after three days of
guerrilla victories throughout the national territory,'' the rebels
said in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos. ``From
the first hours of this Friday the national transportation strike
is suspended.''
   The armed forces' information office said guerrillas destroyed
six vehicles and damaged 11 during the action that began Tuesday.
It had no reports of injuries or deaths.
   It said the traffic ban had the most impact on eastern El
Salvador, where the guerrillas are most active, and in San
Salvador, the nation's capital and largest city.
   Public transportation employees estimated the ban affected about
90 percent of public transportation.
   The rebels ordered the ban because of what they claimed was an
increase in repression by police and the military.
   It was the third such ban declared this year by the rebels who
have been battling the U.S.-backed government for eight years.
   In the two previous actions this year four people were killed,
11 were wounded and 15 vehicles were burned or damaged by gunfire.
   The rebels said this week they would take the license plate
numbers of vehicles being operated during the ban and would take
retaliatory action.

<HEAD>Government Certifying Local Election Results Despite Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government says it will certify
results of township elections held three months ago despite
protests from a group that is Haiti's most vocal defender of the
constitution.
   The Information Ministry said Thursday the results will be
binding when they are published in the official gazette, Le
Moniteur.
   It said everything was ready for publication after Prime
Minister Martial Celestin and Home Secretary Yves Auguste
accompanied Jean Gilbert to the office of a notary public Thursday
to authenticate Gilbert's copy of the results. Gilbert is past
president of the Provisional Electoral Council.
   Dr. Louis Roy of the Honor and Respect for the Constitution
Committee said: ``The Manigat government is taking us for idiots.''
   ``Officialization of the results will be one more illegal act of
his illegitimate regime,'' Roy said of President Leslie Manigat.
   He said the Provisional Electoral Council was dissolved Feb. 7
in conformity with the constitution and ``proclamation of the
results has come too late to be legally binding.''
   The original copy of the election results was said to have been
mislaid in the National Palace after the vote Jan. 31. Gilbert said
on television Thursday he sent copies to the relevant ministries
and the original to the president's office eight or 10 days after
the elections.
   The Honor and Respect for the Constitution Committee is an
association of Protestant and Roman Catholic Church leaders, human
rights groups, business people and private citizens formed to
defend the constitution approved in a referendum March 29, l987.
   A recent declaration by the committee listed 33 articles it said
had been violated, and Roy said ``this will be the 34th violation''
since Manigat took office Feb. 7.
   Two recent demonstrations against failure to publish results of
the township elections were dispersed without violence.
   Haiti has 567 township councils, which are the basis of
decentralized authority under the new constitution.
   Nine regional assemblies are composed of members from the
councils, which also are to provide the candidates for a permanent,
autonomous Electoral Council required by the constitution.

   Riot police fired tear gas to disperse
about 1,000 students staging an anti-government protest Friday and
demonstrators responded with firebombs.
   The students from 10 schools in Seoul threw hundreds of
firebombs in sporadic clashes at Hanyang University.
   ``Topple the dictatorship controlled by Yankees,'' the students
shouted, referring to U.S. influence in their country.
   They also demanded that the government ensure North Korea's
participation in the Olympics, to be held in Seoul this summer.
Communist North Korea has demanded that it be made a co-host of the
Games in return for its participation.
   In another development, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called
Friday for sweeping judicial reforms and charged that the courts
have been used as ``the maid of the government.''
   The opposition leader told a news conference that his Party for
Peace and Democracy will make changing the judiciary its highest
priority during the new National Assembly session.
   ``The fort of human rights has fallen down to the maid of the
government,'' Kim said.
   Kim, whose party emerged as the main opposition force after last
month's legislative elections, charged that many justices in the
Supreme Court ``have curried favors with suppression of human
rights.''
   Kim warned that the government would face ``serious troubles if
it wants to get the Parliament's approval by retaining judges who
have aided the government.''
   Following the governing Democratic Justice Party's loss of its
majority in the April 26 elections, President Roh Tae-woo said he
would work with the opposition to carry out democratic reforms.

<HEAD>Lebanon Asks Security Council For Measures Against Israeli Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon on Friday asked the Security
Council to condemn Israel for sending thousands of troops backed by
tanks and helicopter gunships into its territory earlier this week.
   ``It is no longer permissible that Lebanon and its people should
remain at the mercy, at the whim of Israel's politicians ... or
their expansionist ambitions,'' Lebanese Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury
told the council.
   ``Such an operation cannot be merely an incursion,'' Fakhoury
said. ``Indeed, it was an invasion.''
   Fakhoury said Lebanon wants the council to condemn the raid,
demand that Israel withdraw and take steps to prevent further
Israeli ``aggression.''
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein told the council his country
thrust into Lebanon to protect itself. He said years of civil war
have left Lebanon unable to curb the warring Arab factions that use
its territory to attack Israel.
   ``Israel's only interest and purpose in this operation was to
defend and ensure the peace and security of its villages and
towns,'' Bein said.
   The real threats to Lebanon, he said, are the 35,000 Syrian
troops in that country, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas who
want to set up a radical Islamic state and feuding factions of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Two Palestinian factions battled in Beirut slums on Friday,
leaving at least 28 people dead and 90 wounded, said police in the
Lebanese capital.
   According to Fakhoury, about 800 Israeli troops were still in
southern Lebanon on Thursday. Bein said Israel had withdrawn all of
its troops Wednesday, two days after the raid was launched.
   Israeli officials said their operation was aimed at Palestinian
guerrillas, but it turned into a battle with Hezbollah guerrillas
in Maydoun, a village in southern Lebanon.
   Fakhoury said 3,000 Israeli troops and their Lebanese Christian
militia allies destroyed homes, orchards and crops and left at
least 500 families homeless, including the population of Maydoun.
   Bein said Hezbollah had evicted all the civilians from Maydoun a
year ago and turned it into a fortified guerrilla base. ``During
the action, utmost caution was taken to avoid civilian
casualties,'' he said.
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and withdrew most of its
occupation forces in 1985, but maintains a six-to-10 mile
self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon as a buffer against
terrorist raids.
   The council is scheduled to resume debate Monday.

   A crazed man who slit the throat of a
6-year-old and refused to surrender when sheriff's deputies stormed
the apartment was shot to death Friday, still clutching the boy,
authorities said.
   The child, William Newby, died at Foothill Hospital shortly
after the 7 a.m. attack.
   The assailant, the live-in boyfriend of his mother, was
identified as Leonard W. Browne, 33. He died at University Medical
Center.
   The boy's mother, Glena Trammel, fled their North Point
apartment shortly before the attack and told neighbors Browne had
threatened to hurt the child.
   When deputies stormed the apartment, they found Browne lying on
his back on the kitchen floor, clutching the youngster across his
chest and holding a knife to his throat, said homicide Lt. Ray
Biondi of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.
   ``He was screaming like a wild man,'' Biondi said. ``He was
berserk.''
   ``The suspect was ... ripping at the throat at the child with
his hands, trying to rip the throat out of the child,'' said Lou
Blanas, a sheriff's spokesman.
   Biondi said Browne refused to let the boy go. A deputy fired a
shot into Browne's abdomen to force him to release the child, but
the shot ``only seemed to agitate him,'' Biondi said.
   A deputy then shot two more times into Browne's abdomen and ``he
went limp,'' the lieutenant said.
   Biondi said before the child was attacked there was a
disturbance in the bedroom where Browne and Trammel were. Browne
then grabbed the child, he said.
   Biondi said investigators discovered a cache of crack in the
apartment. Officers at the scene said Browne appeared to be under
the influence of drugs.

   In an easing of its sanctions against North Korea,
Japan will allow a North Korean ping-pong team to visit later this
month, the government said Friday.
   ``We concluded that the group's sole purpose (in visiting Japan)
is to participate in the Asian Table Tennis Championships and that
its lineup is bona fide,'' said Keizo Obuchi, the chief government

   Park Soo-gil, South Korea's assistant foreign minister, said in
Seoul on Friday that his government was studying the Japanese
decision.
   The North Korean team visiting for the May 15-22 tournament
includes two government sports officials.
   The sanctions were announced Jan. 26, after Tokyo blamed North
Korea for the disappearance of a South Korean passenger jet in
November.
   The measures restricted contact between Japanese and North
Korean diplomats and barred North Korean officials from visiting
Japan. The countries do not have diplomatic relations.
   Tokyo newspapers have reported that the Japanese government
wants to improve ties with the North and encourage it to
participate in the 1988 Olympic Games, scheduled to be held in
South Korea in September.

<HEAD>Slovenia Tells Deputies To Try To Unseat Federal Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Parliament of the republic of
Slovenia instructed its deputies in the federal Parliament on
Friday to try to unseat the Yugoslav government, the state news
agency Tanjug reported.
   The issue will be decided May 14-15 when a progress report on
the government of Premier Branko Mikulic will be discussed in the
Parliament.
   ``The Slovenian parliament is instructing its delegation in the
Council of Republics and Provinces of the Parliament of ...
Yugoslavia not to accept the report of the Federal Executive
Council (government) on its two-year work and at the same time
raise the issue of confidence in the federal government,'' Tanjug
said.
   If the six Yugoslav republics and two provinces withdraw their
support for the government through a vote of confidence in the
chamber, it would bring about the first resignation of a Communist
government in the country's history. The Yugoslav constitution,
which includes such a provision, made the country a federal
republic in 1946 under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, a Communist.
   Slovenia is Yugoslavia's most advanced constituent republic. It
has the highest standard of living and almost no unemployment,
although throughout the country more than 1 million of Yugoslavia's
23 million people are unemployed.
   Slovenia has repeatedly criticized the government's unsuccessful
attempts to solve Yugoslavia's economic problems and called for
radical changes in the single-party system.
   Yugoslavia has a 170 percent annual inflation rate and a $20
billion foreign debt.
   ``Although the government carried out numerous tasks, this has
not helped improve the economic situation of the country,'' Tanjug
quoted the Slovenian parliament as saying.
   ``As the source of a majority of laws and steps of economic
policy and its implementer, the Federal Executive Council
(government) is responsible.''
   The Slovenian parliament on Friday elected Janez Stanovnik,
executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe, as president of the republic.
   He and other candidates for the pos had been given air time on
state-run Slovenian television to present their views on how the
crisis in Yugoslavia should be resolved, Tanjug said.
   A popular Belgrade TV commentator wryly observed that Stanovnik,
who receives a $2,000 monthly salary from the United Nations, will
be the first high-ranking Yugoslav official ``not to burden the
working class.''

   The government on Friday banned marches,
meetings and other large public gatherings in the capital before
and during a visit by Pope John Paul II.
   The order, published in the official gazette El Peruano, was
issued under a seldom-used clause in the 2-year-old
state-of-emergency decree. It takes effect Sunday.
   Security will be greatly increased during the Roman Catholic
pontiff's 40-hour stay in Lima to guard against violence by leftist
guerrillas, officials said.
   The Peru visit May 14-16 comes midway through the pope's
four-nation Latin America tour, which begins Saturday.
   While in Lima, the pope is scheduled to celebrate an open air
Mass, hold meetings with church, political and private groups and
close a conference of Latin American bishops.
   The Episcopal Conference of Peru, which is coordinating the
visit, said all of Lima's 50,000 police officers will be on duty
during the pope's stay.
   The conference said an undisclosed number of troops will also be
stationed around the city.
   Police declined Friday to comment on security plans.
   During the pope's only other visit to Peru, in February 1985,
Maoist Shining Path guerrillas caused a widespread power outage,
plunging Lima's airport into blackness as the pope's plane was
landing. The craft touched down safely.
   The Shining Path, Peru's largest and most violent guerrilla
band, has been fighting for eight years to topple the government
and install a worker-peasant state modeled on the China of Mao-Tse
Tung. The government says more than 10,000 people have died in the
fighting.

   Two soldiers said they and two other
troopers were shot and wounded by Nicaraguan rebels Thursday after
they tried to speak with the rebels. It was the second cease-fire
violation reported in two days.
   Forces of the leftist Sandinista government and the
U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, halted offensive military
operations on March 21, two days before Sandinista and Contra
negotiators reached a cease-fire pact. A 60-day truce went into
effect April 1.
   The two soldiers told The Associated Press they were among a
group of Sandinistas who approached about 40 Contras in the town of
El Colorado, about 140 miles southeast of Managua.
   Luis Noel Solano Jarquin, a Sandinista People's Army soldier,
said from his hospital room in Juigalpa, about 65 miles east of
Managua, that the Contras told the soldiers that only top rebel and
government leaders could conduct ``conversations between the two
sides.''
   ``Suddenly we heard shots and had to disband,'' Solano Jarquin
said.
   He said the incident occurred at 9 p.m. Thursday (11:00 p.m.
EDT). He did not specify how many Sandinistas were involved, but
indicated it was not a large group.
   Solano Jarquin nursed a wounded left arm. Another soldier,
Trinidad Bermudez, had fractured ribs and a broken forearm. They
said two other Sandinista soldiers were wounded and being treated
at a hospital in Ciudad Rama, about 140 miles east of Managua.
   A Defense Ministry official said he had no information on the
incident.
   Solano Jarquin and Bermudez said several armed confrontations
have occurred between Sandinista and rebel forces since the
cease-fire went into effect.
   On Thursday, the Defense Ministry charged that Honduras-based
Contras used speedboats to attack a Nicaraguan military position
Wednesday. The rebels did not comment on this.
   Adan Artola, a commander for the Indian rebel group known as
Yatama, said Friday that troops recently attacked rebel positions
in Auya-Pinhi, 270 miles northeast of Managua.
   In a telephone interview from Miami, he said Yatama killed seven
Sandinista soldiers and wounded 23 in the incident.
   The Defense Ministry offered no information on that report.
   Yatama claims to have more than 4,000 guerrillas whose objective
is autonomy for Nicaragua's Indian populations on the Caribbean
coast. It is not formally linked to the Contras.

<HEAD>Kidney Transplants End 3-Year Moratorium On Organ Transplants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Physicians have broken a three-year Japanese
moratorium on organ transplants, caused by controversy over the
definition of donors' death, by transferring kidneys to two
recipients, medical officials said Friday.
   Physicians at the Shinrakuen Hospital in Niigata, 160 miles
northwest of Tokyo, removed the kidneys Thursday from the body of a
brain-dead male donor after receiving permission from his
relatives, a hospital official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Although Japanese physicians have performed about 150 kidney
transplants in the past, Thursday's operations were the first
transplants of major organs conducted in Japan since 1985.
   Organ transplants came to a halt that year after doctors at
Tsukuba University near Tokyo were accused both of murdering a
patient to extract his kidneys and pancreas and of injuring the
recipient, who died about one year after the operation.
   In January, the Japan Medical Association opened the way again
for transplants by deciding that the cessation of brain function is
a sufficient criterion for death. Opponents of transplants have
argued that under Japanese law, human life comes to an end only
when the heart stops and all visible signs of life have disappeared.
   The Science Council of Japan backed the medical association's
decision in February after a yearlong study by the council's
special medical committee.
   Heart transplants have an even shorter history in Japan. The
country's only recorded heart transplant was conducted in 1967 by
Dr. Juro Wada of Sapporo Medical College. Wada was later accused of
sacrificing the life of the donor. The recipient died 82 days after
the operation.

   A labor leader in Gdansk was ordered
jailed Friday for organizing an illegal strike, and Lech Walesa
stirred workers with a speech in the city's strikebound shipyard
after a young man tried to jump from a window.
   Food and morale both were running low when the Solidarity leader
gave his impassioned, impromptu speech to the strikers.
   Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Church, whose mediators had
been trying to solve strikes at Gdansk and Nowa Huta, said in an
official statement that it regretted the government's decision to
end the Nowa Huta strike.
   Th government took steps to toughen its anti-strike laws one day
after police crushed a 10-day-old steelworkers strike at the Nowa
Huta mill in southern Poland.
   New signs cropped up that the government of Premier Wojciech
Jaruzelski was broadening its counterattack against the worst wave
of labor upheaval in Poland since a 1981 military crackdown.
   Jaruzelski, in a speech to a Polish bankers' group, said the
nation's economic difficulties were ``yet again being taken
instrumental advantage of against socialism and ... against our
entire society.''
   He did, however, admit that some mechanisms of the government's
reform program have been ``insufficiently effective,'' the PAP news
agency reported.
   At the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, hundreds of police surrounded
the complex while 800 to 1,000 strikers remained inside. They are
demanding higher wages and union rights.
   Walesa has been in the shipyard since Wednesday.
   A young striker on Friday suddenly rushed to a window of the
big, second-floor cafeteria where most of the strikers have been
gathering, smashed the glass and tried to leap out, according to
Western reporters at the scene.
   Friends grabbed him, pulled him in and took him _ his hands and
face covered with blood _ to the nearby shipyard infirmary. Details
about him were not available, and witnesses could not say what
prompted his sudden action.
   Walesa immediately raced to the dining hall, mounted a chair and
gave an emotional, impromptu speech which had an obvious effect in
lifting spirits.
   Walesa told the strikers, holed up in the shipyard since Monday,
``You know that Solidarity is also taking care of the person next
to you.
   ``Everyone has a thousand problems: because he loves his wife
and he must stay here, another left 500 zlotys ($1.25) to his wife
when he left. Suddenly he realizes she has nothing to live on.
   ``Solidarity must be big here.''
   Reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, said tension
eased and spirits rose after the speech.
   With food supplies to the shipyards stopped by police since
Thursday morning, the strikers had only sauerkraut soup to share.
   ``It seems they are going to use a different scenario than in
Nowa Huta,'' said senior Polish dissident Adam Michnik. ``They
probably want to take the shipyard by hunger.''
   Also Friday, a Gdansk court sentenced a union leader who called
the Lenin shipyard strike on Monday to three months in prison.
   Bogdan Lis, the head of the Gdansk region of the outlawed trade
union federation Solidarity, was convicted of calling an illegal
strike.
   At least five other Solidarity activists were detained Friday,
said Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw who
keeps tracks of arrests nationwide.
   The government drafted a bill that would punish organizers of
strikes and protests with prison sentences of up to one year.
   The draft, obtained by Western news agencies in Warsaw, also
would suspend the already limited right to strike by officially
recognized trade unions.
   At the Nowa Huta steelworks in Krakow, where police staged a
lightning raid with deafening percussion grenades Thursday while
strikers slept, sullen workers emerged after their shifts ended and
refused to talk with reporters. Some murmured that all was normal
in the plant.
   ``We express deep sorrow that an attempt of dialogue and social
conciliation did not bring the expected results,'' the Roman
Catholic Church secretariat said. ``This does not serve the welfare
of society or the country.''
   ``With outrage we protest the use of force against striking
workers and students. We think that the use of force leads to the
worst possible social effects,'' said a statement by Aleksander
Koj, rector at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, a state-run
university.
   A local Solidarity leader, Stanislaw Wadolowski, said the threat
of force ended a one-day strike by bus drivers in the northwestern
city of Szczecin. He said riot police were put into position
outside bus yards Thursday, six strikers were briefly detained, and
the strike ended after 10 hours.
   Wage demands triggered by 42 percent inflation this year have
prompted at least five strikes since April 25, and the government
confirmed this week it would seek additional economic powers to
accelerate its program to reform the economy.
   The government has said the strikes could derail the reform
plans by making wages rise faster than prices. Plans call for
higher and more realistic prices, smaller government subsidies and
improved conditions for managers and private enterprise.
   Solidarity generally favors the reforms. But a statement by
Walesa Friday from inside the shipyard said that, ``Society must be
the co-author and partner in the solutions.''

   Vice President George Bush characterized
Jesse Jackson as a ``hustler from Chicago'' on Friday during a day
in which he said he was ``troubled by some of the allegations''
against Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Bush's remarks about Jackson came on the way home from three
days of campaigning in the West.
   Addressing a Republican dinner at the University of Nebraska,
Bush said: ``It's a pleasure to be here. And I'll be back. And I'm
not going to be out-hustled by the hustler from Chicago or from
that traditional liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.''
   It was a clear reference to the two remaining Democratic
candidates: Jackson, who has a home in Chicago, and Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, the front-runner.
   While Bush has called Dukakis a traditional liberal Democrat
before, his ``hustler'' remark was the first time he has described
Jackson in such terms.
   Bush spokesman Stephen Hart said the vice president ``was
talking about how hard he (Jackson) has hustled. It was nothing
derogatory.''
   Earlier, Bush said that comments by two senior campaign aides
suggesting Meese was a campaign liability had not been authorized
by him. At the same time, he said he was troubled by some of the
allegations against Meese.
   The vice president said that ``my position on Meese is that the
system is working, the investigation is going on and can't be
enhanced by my fine-tuning or criticizing.''
   Bush's comments, in a session with reporters, came after his
communications director Peter Teeley and Robert Teeter, a senior
campaign adviser, were quoted as saying that Meese has become a
liability in Bush's campaign for the presidency.
   ``I haven't authorized anything. Now I have to get on the phone
and find out what they said,'' Bush told reporters earlier in Twin
Falls, Idaho.
   In Billings, Mont., Bush said that he had talked to the aides
but declined to characterize his conversation. A campaign source,
who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Bush was angry when
he talked with Teeley.
   Of Meese, Bush said in Billings: ``I know him well, favorably,
but I must say I am troubled by some of the allegations. I think
fair play dictates that the system go forward and make the
determination.''
   Asked if Meese had become an albatross on his campaign, Bush
said: ``An albatross? I don't think so.''
   Bush added that the independent counsel investigating the
attorney general's legal difficulties was due to release a report
soon, and said: ``We'll see what it says. It's only a matter of a
few days away.''
   The Detroit News, in a story published Friday, said Teeley and
Teeter made their comments in interviews this week in Washington.
   ``Meese is a liability,'' Teeley was quoted as saying.
   ``All things considered, you would rather not have that problem
going on right now,'' Teeter said, referring to the independent
counsel's investigation of Meese.
   In comments on other subjects:
   _The vice president called on the government of Poland to
negotiate with striking workers and to include the outlawed labor
union Solidarity in talks to end violence there.
   _Campaigning for farm-area support, Bush attacked Democratic
front-runner Dukakis for advocating a greater federal role in
control of Western water rights.
   ``We're going to have a lively debate in the fall,'' Bush said.
``He was wrong and I was right.''
   Talking with a group of farmers in a barn in Idaho, with a sleet
storm howling outside, Bush said water allocation for irrigation
should remain under state control.
   He also promised to keep sugar quotas and other government farm
trade supports in place, despite the Reagan administration's desire
for an eventual elimination of all farm subsidies and quotas
worldwide.
   Bush said the quotas should be maintained at least until other
countries eliminate their own farm subsidies.
   In Billings, Bush continued with his agricultural theme, telling
an airport rally, ``There will be no more grain embargoes against
the Soviet Union or anyone else. We are not going to use food as a
political weapon.''
   Former President Carter's grain embargo _ in response to the
sending of Soviet troops into Afghanistan _ was unpopular in
grain-producing states.
   Bush expressed surprise when told by reporters of the comments
on Meese by his two aides.
   In the past, Bush has said the Justice Department should be
``above reproach.'' But he has also said he does not want to
prejudge Meese, and the legal system should be permitted to take
its course.
   ``I've said about all I need to say on that for awhile,'' Bush
said on Friday.
   However, the aides' public comments that Meese's legal
difficulties have become a liability to the Bush campaign reflect
what other campaign advisers have said privately in the past.
   Campaign aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, have
said that Bush would be relieved if Meese would resign because the
situation had become an embarrassment for the campaign.
   The same sources said Bush had not urged Meese to resign nor
advocated such a course to the president.
   On Poland, Bush said the government there should recognize the
reality of the Solidarity movement and deal with its leaders to
avoid further violence in that strike-torn country.
   ``I know they consider Solidarity illegal. But given the state
of play there, they should talk to each other and get this under
control so people in Poland will not be hurt,'' he said.
   Speaking to students at the College of Southern Idaho, Bush
heralded the 5.4 percent unemployment figure for April reported
earlier in the day _ the lowest rate since 1974 _ and used it to
mount a new attack on Democrats.
   ``When I hear the political opponents going around about pink
slips and disaster, they're flying in the face of some
extraordinary economic progress. Yes, some people are still
hurting, but I want to see this recovery continue until everybody
benefits,'' he said.
   In comments to local reporters in Twin Falls, Bush made light of
the ``Massachusetts miracle'' of economic revival that Dukakis has
trumpeted.
   ``I think there will be plenty of things to use in our favor in
terms of who's responsible for the Massachusetts miracle,'' he
said. ``I happen to think the Reagan-Bush administration had
something to do with that.''
   Bush also asserted that although he expected the Iran-Contra
affair to be used against him in the general election, ``I'm not
worried. It's been tested and tried in the primary.''
   His involvement in the affair ``doesn't show up as a great
vulnerability,'' he has said.

   Avery Fisher Career Grants, designed to assist
musicians believed to be on the threshold of major careers, were
awarded Thursday to two violinists, a pianist and a guitarist.
   Violinists Pamela Frank and Ida Kavafian, pianist Andrew Rangell
and guitarist David Starobin were named this year's recipients of
the grants of $1,000 each.
   Miss Frank, 20, born in New York and living in Philadelphia,
studies at the Curtis Institute of Music with Jaime Laredo. Miss
Kavafian, 35, born in Istanbul and living in New York, has a
masters degree from the Juilliard School. She was a founding member
of the group Tashi and has recorded for RCA and Nonesuch.
   Rangell, 39, born in Chicago and living in Hanover, N.H., has a
doctorate from Juilliard and was a Naumburg Competition finalist.
From 1977 through '85, he taught piano at Dartmouth College.
   Starobin, 36, born in New York and living in Great Neck, N.Y.,
is a member of and conducts the contemporary music ensemble
Speculum Musicae. In 1981 he founded Bridge Records. More than 150
guitar works have been composed for him.
   Three to five Avery Fisher Career Grants can be awarded each
year, all to U.S. citizens. Recipients are proposed by a large
board and chosen by a nine-man committee of musicians and arts
administrators. The grants are part of the Avery Fisher Artist
Program.

   A polio-stricken executive at a burning
rocket fuel plant chose to stay behind and call the fire department
rather than flee with fellow workers, and that cost him his life,
plant officials say.
   Shortly after Leroy Westerfield made his telephone call, an
earthquake-force explosion obliterated the Pacific Engineering
Production Co. building and 11 others in the industrial complex,
killing another man and injuring more than 255 people.
   Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, a friend of Westerfield, apparently
died while he tried to coax the crippled man from the inferno,
co-workers say. Westerfield, 62, had been partially paralyzed by
polio since he was 19.
   ``If he was there, he'll stay around until everyone gets out,''
said Halker's wife, Roma, as she awaited word of his fate. ``That
plant was his whole life.''

unbalanced equation in talks aimed at reaching a long-term cease
fire in their seven-year war.
   ``The message will be given to the ... Sandinista government

   The number of Americans at work rose by 606,000 last month while
those listed as unemployed fell by 191,000 to 6.6 million, dropping
joblessness 0.2 percentage points from March's rate of 5.6 percent,
the Labor Department said.
   The rate was the lowest since June 1974 when it also stood at
5.4 percent but at time when the nation was well into a steep

   Even a regional dish, the unique charcoal-roasted beef called
``carne asada,'' has been maligned.
   ``Where carne asada begins, civilization ends.''
   So said Jose Vasconcelos, the intellectual and Mexican education
minister in 1920-24.
   His remark was often repeated by others.
   But attitudes like these are starting to change, thanks to
Northern Mexico's new-found economic strength, impressive cultural
programs and election-year politicking.
   Underlying the North's sudden popularity is a government attempt
to strengthen national unity at a time when overall economic and
political uncertainty troubles the entire country.
   ``I've come to tell you that I'm proud to be of the North,''
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, presidential candidate of the dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party, said on a campaign tour. ``Here,
words are converted into actions.''
   Although born in Mexico City, the often-scorned federal capital,
Salinas de Gortari's father was a Northerner and the candidate has
maintained strong ties to the North.
   Another reflection of the attitude change appeared in a recent
issue of the national magazine El Cotidiano: ``For a long time the
border was viewed as a place where the most corrosive elements of
the nation took root: denationalization, provincialism, barbarism,
unlimited reinforcement of the `American way of life.'
   ``Recent investigations ... have proven the fallacy of the
generalized idea that border inhabitants are, by definition,
pro-North American.''
   The North consists of the states of Northern Baja California,
Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. They are
spread across 316,000 square miles of mostly barren land that
extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Thirteen
million of Mexico's 82 million people live there.
   Divided from each other by vast deserts and two Sierra Madre
ranges and from the rest of Mexico by hundreds of miles and
different histories, the isolated Northerners have learned to rely
on themselves.
   Their ties to the U.S. Southwest, which was part of Mexico until
1848, are cultural and economic, but their national identity and
regional pride is strong.
   ``The United States wants to analyze Mexico according to
American standards. They think whatever is good for America has to
be good for the rest of the world,'' said Mayor Jaime Bermudez of
Ciudad Juarez, a Northern city.
   ``But we're different. We think differently and we live
differently.''
   Out of a hostile environment, Northerners created strong
regional economies that have helped sustain Mexico for decades: the
mines of Chihuahua and Coahuila, cattle ranches and agricultural
fields of Sonora, industry and citrus of Nuevo Leon, fishing and
tourism in Baja California, oil shipping, agriculture and border
businesses in Tamaulipas.
   Aptly nicknamed ``The Sultan of the North,'' the city of
Monterrey with 2.8 million people is the region's largest, richest
and most industrialized city.
   Nearer the border, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, vying to become
second largest with a little over a million people each, are the
two most dynamic cities in the area today. This is due largely to
investments in the ``maquiladora'' industry, foreign-owned assembly
operations that produce goods at Mexico's lower wages for export,
mostly to the United States.
   ``When the economic crisis began in 1982 this zone suffered
serious and profound uncertainty,'' said the outgoing President
Miguel de la Madrid during his most recent tour of border cities.
   ``But with new development plans during these past few years,
the northern border has become one of the most dynamic zones in the
country from the economic point of view.''
   As did previous presidents, de la Madrid has pumped hundreds of
millions of pesos into the North, much of it for sewers, roads,
electricity, water and other necessities.
   But government funding has been targeted in recent years for
cultural centers, museums, libraries and city beautification
projects like parks and plazas.
   The emphasis on Northern cultural development, which started
about five years ago, stemmed from a mistaken belief in Mexico City
that the border states needed to be rescued from a U.S. cultural
invasion, said Jorge Bustamante, director of the Tijuana-based
Northern Border College.
   Nevertheless, such cultural programs as a first-ever arts
festival in Sonora last year, forums on border issues and a new
magazine called Cultura Norte are giving Northerners opportunities
to express their unique art forms.

   And inevitably, the ``uncultured provincial hicks'' tag is
fading away, while regional pride is strengthened.
   ``We've always resented the fact that the North was paying taxes
and everything went to Mexico City,'' said Mayor Bermudez.
   ``But now the government sees the monster it created (in Mexico
City). It has finally realized that we are producing things, and
it's investing here.'' Meanwhile, Northern Mexico's ``maquiladora''
industry is becoming more and more crucial to national efforts to
ride out the severe economic crisis that has plagued the country
for six years.
   Shunned as second-class operations when they started in the
mid-1960s, the maquiladoras now vie with tourism as the No. 2
source of foreign income for Mexico after oil.
   More than 330,000 people worked in 1,400 maquildaoras last year
while the industry brought in more than $1.4 billion in revenues.
And new plants are opening up throughout the North.
   ``Nowadays the opportunities are more in the North. This is the
land of opportunity,'' said Jorge Juarez, manager of a maquiladora
in Ciudad Juarez.
   One result has been higher education levels and incomes in the
North than national averages. Uemployment generally is lower.
   Still, Northern Mexico has problems.
   Inflation and the cost of living in the largely dollar-based
societies usually run higher than the national average, up to 25
percent higher right on the border.
   The North is a new frontier for people fleeing the chaos caused
by overpopulation, pollution and earth tremors of Mexico City, the
poverty of Mexico's indigenous South, and the boredom of life on
sparse communal farms.
   It's a way station for illegal immigrants on their way to the
United States, and the drain on limited public services is showing.
   Crime and drug addiction are rising. Housing is in short supply
in the cities. Farmers are clamoring for increases in the
guaranteed prices for their products.
   Even with that, however, Northern Mexico still gains new
respect, not only because of its increasing economic power but also
because of candidate Salinas de Gortari's emphasis on his Northern
heritage and what his party calls his ``Northern qualities.''
   ``Northerners always have had to fend for themselves,'' said
Romeo Flores Caballero, a federal congressman from Nuevo Leon,
where Salinas de Gortari's father was born. ``That produced a
independent breed of people known for their sincerity, work ethics
and frankness.
   ``Salinas de Gortari definitely has those qualities.''
   Northern Mexico, however, is a stronghold of the opposition
National Action Party, and its presidential candidate is wooing
voters with a promise of cleaning up corruption, long a sore spot
with Northerners.
   Meanwhile, the third major presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, has drawn huge crowds in the North, specifically in
Coahuila's Laguna Region.
   Farmers there remember Cardenas' father, the late President
Lazaro Cardenas, for his agrarian reform program that gave them
land.
   While other Mexicans are looking northward with new respect
these days, Northerners are looking southward, mindful of the
distant past.
   Hector Manuel Gallego, the rector of the University of Baja
California, alluded to that in his book, ``Northern Mexico:
Historical Vision of the Border.''
   ``If the abrupt mountains and the sizzling deserts have
separated those in the different regions of the border, the
knowledge of a shared past brings us together,'' he wrote.
   ``What geography has separated, history unites,''

<HEAD>Fred De Cordova Tells All About Johnny Carson in New Book</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fred de Cordova says anyone familiar with his
18 years as executive producer of NBC's ``Tonight Show'' would know
his autobiography would not be a ``Johnny Dearest.''
   ``Johnny Came Lately'' is a tell-all book about ``Tonight Show''
host Johnny Carson _ except, as De Cordova tells it, Carson is a
nice guy and he's enjoyed every minute of their association.
   ``I believe that when you've known someone as long as I've known
Johnny,'' he said, ``and your reactions are almost identical as to
what's acceptable, there's no fear this would be a `Johnny
Dearest.' Some people say I go lightly on Johnny. But I've never
harbored any differences.''
   The book ``Mommie Dearest'' was a scathing account of life with
actress Joan Crawford by her adopted daughter, Christina Crawford.
   ``I'm a great fan,'' De Cordova said. ``So it wasn't likely that
I would say Johnny is a star but not a nice guy. ... We've had our
differences, as anyone would over 18 years. But we've never carried
anything over to the next day.''
   De Cordova twice booked himself as a guest on the show to talk
about his new book. And twice bumped himself before the writer's
strike shut down the show.
   ``The Tonight Show'' returns Wednesday night, with Carson
writing his own monologues and introductions. De Cordova said one
of the first things he will do is re-schedule himself as a guest.
   The title to the book was picked by De Cordova's wife, Janet,
because the association with Johnny Carson came late in De
Cordova's career, when he was already 60.
   Carson has been host of the late-night show 25 years. ``I can't
imagine when Johnny will say he's had enough, and I don't think
it's in the near future,'' De Cordova said, ``but I can't think of
anything else that would be as interesting and as much fun as this.
It's the best job in television.''
   He said he and Carson work closely on the show, discussing
guests and what they will do each night. ``He cares,'' he said.
``He does not phone it in. He works very hard and he wants everyone
else to work as hard as he does.''
   De Cordova does speak out on other personalities:
   Jack Paar, Carson's predecessor _ ``He came back against `The
Tonight Show' and he thought the audience might love him again. I
don't say this rudely, but that was not the case. He was the same
Jack Paar he was 10 years ago, but the audience's tastes had moved
on.''
   Pat Sajak, host of the ``Wheel of Fortune'' game show _ ``He had
a letter hand-delivered to Johnny telling him he was going to CBS
to do a late-night talk show (scheduled to premier sometime in the
new season). Johnny, in his fashion, wished him luck _ but not too
much.''
   Comedian Joan Rivers, one-time regular stand-in for Carson who
briefly had her own late-night show on the Fox Broadcasting Co.
network _ ``To my practiced eye it was apparent quite quickly she
wasn't going to be strong competition to `Tonight.' When she was
Johnny's sub she was a good change of pace. She did well in the
ratings, but there was heavy mail against her. Also _ and this is
self-serving _ when she worked on our show she was under strict
control. We really fought her on jokes. She said they went over in
her night club act, but we'd tell her she was playing to Johnny's
audience.''
   The book, published by Simon & Schuster at $17.95, also looks at
De Cordova's long career on the stage, in movies and in television.
   DeCordova, fresh out of Harvard Law School, got a job as a
``gofer'' in the theatrical offices of Lee and J.J. Shubert in New
York in 1933. He became a stage manager, then a director. The last
show he did was `Ziegfeld Follies' in 1943 with Milton Berle,
Arthur Treacher and Ilona Massey.
   After that, he signed with Warner Bros. One of the pictures he
directed there was ``Bedtime for Bonzo,'' which starred Ronald
Reagan and a chimpanzee. He directed about 50 pictures in all
before going into television.
   He was the producer or director for ``Burns and Allen,'' ``The
Jack Benny Show,'' ``My Three Sons,'' and numerous specials for
Bing Crosby, Claudette Colbert, Noel Coward, Lauren Bacall and many
others.
   ``I have managed to involve myself with people who are extremely
pleasant to work with and who are extremely talented, and that
includes Johnny Carson,'' De Cordova said. ``Carson makes me happy
to go to work and my wife makes me happy to go home.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Need an expert on reincarnation? Nuclear power?
Economics? Sex? Boredom?
   Questions about computers, atheism or weight loss have you
stumped?
   The ``Directory of Experts, Authorities and Spokespersons''
offers to fill the void.
   The 1987-88 directory, the fourth annual edition, provides in
its 384 yellow pages an encyclopedia of sources of fact and opinion
on subjects ranging from AIDS to zoological parks. The sources
range from serious experts to whimsical organizations.
   Subscribers to what is subtitled the ``Talk Show Guest
Directory'' include the major TV networks, magazines, newspapers
and the U.S. bureaus of foreign publications and news agencies.
   ``This new edition has been written from scratch after directly
contacting tens of thousands of sources,'' said editor Mitchell P.
Davis. ``We have done the research to find 3,524 experts,
authorities and spokespersons who have stated their willingness to
be interviewed.''
   Subjects and sources are interspersed with advertisements,
similar to the Yellow Pages telephone directory. The book is
published by Broadcast Interview Source of Washington.
   ``More Americans are Trying Nude Recreation,'' says a full-page
ad by the American Sunbathing Association in Florida, which is
available for media questions regarding nudist viewpoints.
   The Society for the Eradication of Television has a cartoon
drawing of a man kicking in a TV. ``The battle over the future of
TV is looming as Eradicators challenge couch potatoes,'' the ad
says.
   The couch potatoes, so named because of a tendency to vegetate
in front of the telly, counter in a separate ad below with ``six
arguments in support of television.'' They include: ``TV viewing is
purely an American form of meditation.'' For information call head
spud Bob Armstrong in California.
   The ``minister of information'' for the Couch Potatoes, Jack
Mingo of Alameda, Calif., acknowledged that his group is mostly
tongue-in-cheek.
   ``But we practice what we believe, or else we would be
hypocrites, don't you think?'' Mingo said.
   He said the unpaid ad has brought numerous calls. Most of them
come from radio stations who enjoy getting the potatoes in debate
with the TV eradicators, whom Mingo described as ``grimly serious.''
   The Shameless Hussy Press pledges to provide speakers on women's
subjects. Various others offer expertise on handwriting analysis,
psychic phenomena and financial matters, including one which states
in bold letters ``Offshore Banking Is Not Evil.''
   The Boring Institute provides commentary on politics, show
business, televison films and personalities, ``plus some good
advice on how to avoid and overcome boredom,'' even in sex.
   ``We pursue those amusing ads because they interest people and
get them to read the book. It's not just a reference book,'' said
Davis, who got the idea from a monthly newsletter of sources put
out by a public relations firm for which he worked.
   About 95 percent of the ads are paid, he said. Some are offered
for public service or for graphic interest.
   One that falls in both categories is the full-page ad with
surprising photos of bruised, bare buttocks, put in by People
Opposed to Paddling of Students.
   Other advertisers in the directory use clever lead-ins.
   ``Totally `Childish' Conversation,'' is promised by a Cleveland
hospital offering ``expert conservation on all manner of childish
subjects: neonatology, birthing, obstetrics, pediatrics.''
   Others are more straightforward.
   School prayer, cults, creationism? ``American Atheists can speak
on all of them _ and more.''
   Davis said this year's book contains about 180 pages of ads at
$360 a page. Copies distributed, including free ones, total 4,000,
he said.
   According to Davis, the book is popular enough to be a viable
business.
   ``It'll be back next year in a fifth edition,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sheehy: Dukakis Fiercely Determined, Bush `Ideal No. 2'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has a strong desire to prove
that he is the best. Michael Dukakis pursues success with a fierce
determination. George Bush is an ``ideal No. 2.''
   Gail Sheehy provides these character assessments of the
presidential candidates in her new book, ``Character: America's
Search for Leadership.''
   The book, which will be published this week, updates a series of
profiles Sheehy did for Vanity Fair magazine during the past two
years and adds a new study _ President Reagan.
   ``Character is more than just a factor in our evaluation of how
we are going to vote,'' Sheehy writes in her book. ``It affects us
all as an essential ingredient in how we work, play and deal with
other people.''
   The author, asked during the 1984 campaign to write a story on
``What made Gary Hart tick?,'' said she found ``a virgin
territory'' of reporting on a candidate's character.
   ``I went and looked at them as human beings,'' Sheehy said in a
telephone interview last week. ``Why wait for the biography when
they're out of favor, out of office, out of life. These are early
biographies.''
   At the time, Sheehy said there was ``a lot of snickering about
this sort of soft-headed approach.''
   ``It's wasn't hard horserace stuff, tipsters. I'm not saying
it's more important, but additional,'' she said.
   However, some critics say the style of reporting is
psychoanalyzing by a journalist and that Sheehy is neither trained
nor qualified to do it. She believes she answers her critics in the
book.
   ``I don't pretend to be a psychoanalyst, nor do I work like
one,'' she wrote. ``I base my character analyses on evidence _
evidence I go out and dig up.''
   In discussing whether she answers the critics, Sheehy noted that
she doesn't use any psychiatric terms in discussing the candidates.
   ``I use the words of journalists and biographers, those being
insights,'' she said. ``Insights are part of political journalism
and literary journalism. It hasn't often been done with major
national political figures except in biographies.''
   Her purpose, she says, is to ``mentally go beyond the facade''
created by the campaign image-makers and the media.
   Here is a summary of Sheehy's profiles of the three remaining
presidential candidates and Reagan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEORGE BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Bush has, in fact, the perfect resume for someone seeking
appointive office. He has always been an ideal No. 2: He does what
he is trained to do, never challenges, never initiates ...,''
Sheehy wrote. ``If he reaches the White House in 1989, it will not
be through the process of political combat and conquest, but by
polite succession to the throne.''
   She suggested that Bush rarely gets fired up about ideas and has
spent a lifetime avoiding confrontation, despite his televised
run-in with CBS anchorman Dan Rather over the vice president's role
in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Bush's baseball hero was not Babe Ruth, but the Yankees' quiet
Iron Horse, Lou Gehrig, Sheehy notes.
   In the portrait, Bush describes flying torpedo bombers over the
Pacific during World War II, including the morning of Sept. 2, 1944
when his plane was hit. Bush bailed out and survived in a tiny raft
until rescued by a U.S. submarine.
   The vice president has difficulty discussing the death of his
young daughter Robin, who succumbed to leukemia. According to his
wife, Barbara, Bush maintained a bedside vigil at the New York
hospital where his daughter underwent chemotheraphy, returning to
Texas every few days to manage a new oil business in Midland.
   But Sheehy writes, ``Bush apparently can't synthesize the
episodes of highest drama in his life and assign them meaning. If
he had been able to see his war experiences as a test of strength,

   ``Stubbornness. This above all, registers as the most consistent
mark of Michael Dukakis' character. Monos mou _ by myself _ if not
his first words, he admits, were certainly the watchword of the
second son born to Panos and Euterpe Dukakis. Was he always
stubborn? I asked his mother. `Always. Michael never gave up.'''
   Dukakis describes programming himself to grow three inches every
year until he was 5-foot-11, but he stopped at 5-foot-8.
Nevertheless, in junior high school, when the gym teacher said,
``All the tall kids line up over here for basketball,'' Dukakis
joined the tall kids.
   Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants who dreamed of being
governor even in high school, succeeded through much of his life _
upper-middle-class, Swarthmore, Harvard Law School, and finally
governor of Massachusetts. But in 1978, he suffered his first
failure, losing his re-election bid. At the age of 44, Dukakis was
forced to rethink his mistakes and his career.
   ``I blew it,'' he would say, ``too management-oriented and
politically naive?''
   Sheehy writes, ``Dukakis accepted blame for failure just as he
had pursued success _ monos mou, by himself.''
   In January, Dukakis told Sheehy, ``I want to be president, but
not so badly; I mean, it's an incredible experience, for all of us.
And I'm running to win. But if it isn't there, I'm still going to
be a happy guy.''

   ``He is in transition. Indeed, he seems to be in the middle of
at least three passages at once: personal, political and
historical,'' Sheehy writes.
   ``He has lived all his life as an outsider and learned to
capitalize on it. Now he is within reach of what he has always
wanted, to be accepted.''
   Jackson, as a child nicknamed ``Bo-Diddley'' for the guitarist,
is an illegitimate son who furtively and enviously watched his
half-brother Noah Robinson Jr., across the street from the
Greenville, S.C., playground.
   ``I wanted to be with him so bad,'' Noah Robinson Sr., told
Sheehy.
   When Jackson was asked about his childhood, he said, ``I never
was motherless or fatherless, or hungry. I was never orphaned. I
was (legally) adopted when I was a teen-ager.''
   Jackson would tell Robinson Sr., ``Just you watch, I'm going to
be more than you think I can be.'' After the second year of high
school, Jackson had a dream in which he led his people across the
river, ``I was a born leader,'' he said.
   Sheehy details the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., when Jackson said he was on the balcony and
cradled the slain civil rights leader in his arms. Black leaders
questioned his story and the whether the turtleneck sweater he wore
was really stained with King's blood.
   ``That to me is the most gruesome crime a man can commit,''
Sheehy quotes the Rev. James Bevel as saying. ``To lie about the
crucifixion of a prophet within a race.''
   ``A lot of people aspire to the presidency,'' Jackson told
Sheehy. ``But they are so preoccupied with the day-to-day
adjustments and maneuvering, they don't take the time to think
presidential.''

<HEAD>RONALD REAGAN</HEAD>

   ``If his father used alcohol to escape reality, and his mother
used religious devotion, Ronald Reagan found his escape in
daydreams,'' Sheehy writes.
   ``Since early childhood, then, Reagan has been denying harsh
realities and concocting his own, more pleasant alternatives.''
   This profile, previously unpublished, is based on interviews
with the president's close advisers who requested anonymity and
excerpts from various books written by Reagan, journalists and
former White House staffer Michael K. Deaver.
   Sheehy concludes that, ``In reality, Reagan has been one of the
most passive and easily manipulated presidents of this century.''
   The portrait traces the Reagan image, the control by his wife,
Nancy, and his loyalty to his staff, including Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, Deaver and Lyn Nofziger.
   Deaver and Nofziger have been convicted of criminal charges, and
Meese is the subject of a grand jury investigation.
   Sheehy says adult children of alcoholics ``often show extreme
loyalty, but of a childish kind, sticking for those who are
underserving of such loyalty.''
   She concludes that the Reagan presidency went wrong ``because he
came into office quite unable to change. The American people caught
on that his story was imaginary. They discovered what Ronald Reagan
had tried to hide as a kid _ that he lived in a world of pretend.
He didn't have a strong second act. And finally he couldn't find a
happy ending.''

   Cool weather and an early Easter hurt retail sales in April,
reports from the nation's largest general retailers reveal.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Thursday its overall sales rose 4.8
percent from April 1987's results, while K mart Corp. was up 2.5
percent and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. fell 0.4 percent.
   Analysts said cool weather hurt sales of spring apparel as well
as lawn and garden and seasonal merchandise, while early arrival of
Easter this year meant consumers did their spring shopping in March.
   Although some retailers saw sales rise, analysts said the gains
were less than expected.

   Oil futures prices have strengthened in the wake
of a Gulf Coast refinery explosion that tightened gasoline
supplies, and amid market sentiment that domestic demand for crude
is accelerating, analysts say.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for
wholesale unleaded gasoline closed up 0.89 cent at 50.61 cents per
gallon on Thursday. Wholesale heating oil rose 0.37 cent to 46.57
cents per gallon.
   June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark
crude, also closed higher Thursday, rising 19 cents to $17.39 per
barrel.
   In Norco, La., an early morning explosion and fire devastated a
Shell Oil Co. refinery and much of the surrounding town. The
accident ruptured the refinery's catalytic cracker, which converts
crude oil to gasoline, and seriously damaged control rooms and
other facilities.
   Greg Dreis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said the
destruction created a squeeze in the Gulf Coast, sending gasoline
futures prices up in New York when the market opened.
   Bob Baker, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst, said he
agreed that the explosion ``clearly gave some relative strength to
gasoline here.''
   He also said crude moved higher because ``people realize we're
going to be needing crude oil here _ and (foreign) oil producers
are still holding the reins'' of production.
   ``They're not talking with each other all the way. But they're
talking enough,'' he said, referring to both the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and independent producing nations.
   OPEC and several major independent producers failed earlier this
week to reach an accord on joint output cuts aimed at boosting
prices.

<HEAD>Footnotes Expanded for AP Mutual Fund Lists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mutual fund lists appearing in newspapers are
carrying some new footnotes.
   Because of the growing complexity and variation in commissions,
dividends and fees for mutual funds, The Associated Press has
revised the footnotes it uses to denote those aspects of funds.
   For instance, an ``NL'' designation in place of an offering
price is being used in the daily list now only when a mutual fund
truly is ``no load'' _ that is, there is no sales commission to buy
into the fund or to redeem shares and get out.
   The weekly mutual fund tables will denote no-load funds with an
``n'' footnote after the name.
   Some funds do not charge a commission when you buy shares but do
charge a fee if the shares are sold within a certain period, a
condition called a contingent-deferred-sales charge. Those funds
are shown having an offering price the same as the net asset value
(NAV) and carry a new footnote _ ``r'' _ after the name of the fund.
   Some funds charge an annual fee to cover marketing expenses,
although they do not include the charge in their advertised sales
fee. That condition is denoted with a ``p'' footnote following the
fund name.
   Funds that both have a contingent-deferred-sales charge and
charge a percentage of fund assets for marketing expenses now carry
a ``t'' footnote.
   Footnotes also have been changed for denoting ex-dividend,
ex-distribution and stock split or stock dividends.
   Previously, all those conditions were represented by an ``x''
footnote. Now ``x'' designates an ex-dividend, ``e'' means
ex-distribution of capital gains and ``s'' denotes a stock split or
stock dividend.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Here is the explanation of the footnotes for the mutual funds
list:
   e _ Ex capital gains distribution. s _ Stock dividend or split.
x _ Ex cash dividend.
   f _ Previous day's quote. (NL)n _ No frontend load or contingent
deferred sales load. p _ Fund assets are used to pay for
distribution costs-12(b)(1) plan. r _ Redemption fee or contingent
deferred sales load may apply. t _ Both p and r.

   Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills rose
in the government's latest auction to the highest level since
December.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.8 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 6.74 percent on Thursday, up from 6.57
percent at the last auction on April 7.
   The rates were the highest since Dec. 17, when the one-year

   A cold spell and an early Easter curbed consumer buying last
month and contributed to lower-than-expected sales for the nation's
largest general retailers, according to industry analysts.
   April was not expected to be a strong month because many
consumers did their Easter shopping in March, due to the
earlier-than-usual holiday. But it was colder than usual in many
parts of the country last month, and that slowed sales of spring
clothing and of seasonal merchandise such as gardening equipment
and patio furniture, analysts said.
   The ongoing slump in consumer spending also contributed to the
poor results, which were released Thursday by the nation's big
general retailers.
   Sales rose for some retailers, but analysts deemed the gains
lackluster.
   Linda Kristiansen, an analyst with the investment firm Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., described spending as ``softer than it had
been,'' and predicted there would be little improvement before the
end of 1988.
   ``It's a continuing of what we've been seeing for the last
several months,'' said Joseph Ronning, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman Inc. Ronning predicted sales would pick up in the
second half of the year.
   Economists watch retail sales closely because consumer spending
accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales rose 4.8 percent from April 1987, and 3 percent for
the first 13 weeks of the fiscal year. Sales from stores open at
least a year _ known as same-store sales _ rose 2 percent in April
and 1.4 percent for the year so far.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 2.5 percent last month
and 4.4 percent for the year to date. Its same-store sales fell 0.6
percent in April and rose 1.5 percent for the first 13 weeks.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales climbed 32 percent
in April and 33 percent for the first three months. The rapidly
expanding chain said its same-store sales rose 12 percent last
month and 13 percent for the year so far.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which heavily emphasizes its apparel
lines, saw sales decline 0.4 percent last month. Year-to-date sales
were up 3.7 percent.
   Limited Inc., another major apparel retailer, said its overall
sales fell 8 percent last month and rose 1 percent for the first
three months of the fiscal year. Same-store sales fell 16 percent
in April and 7 percent so far this year.
   Fashion retailers have been slumping since last fall and are not
expected to see business turn around until this summer at the
earliest.
   The sales announced Thursday were from general and apparel
retailers and do not reflect sales of auto dealers or supermarkets.
   Among other retailers, Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall
sales rose 7.9 percent last month and 18.2 percent for the first 13
weeks. Same-store sales declined 6.9 percent in April and rose 1.4
percent year-to-date.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales fell 4.4
percent in April and rose 2.6 percent year-to-date. May's
same-store sales dropped 7.1 percent last month and 0.9 percent so
far this year.
   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported a 5.3 percent drop in sales last
month, and an 11.6 percent increase for the first 13 weeks.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its sales dipped 0.3 percent last
month, and rose 2.7 percent for the year so far.

<BYLINE>With Chrysler Back on Pattern, UAW and Big Three Can Aim at
Japanese</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union has brought the Big
Three U.S. automakers back under an industry pattern contract for
the first time in a decade, with this week's settlement at Chrysler
Corp.
   But since the UAW first allowed Chrysler to negotiate a separate
concessionary contract in 1979, the U.S. auto industry has changed,
and the pattern contract that is shaping its future has changed
with it.
   Instead of just the Big Three _ Chrysler, General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. _ and American Motors Corp., eight U.S. and
foreign companies build cars in the United States.
   Chrysler bought AMC in August and Volkswagen, the only European,
will leave the picture later this year when it closes its
Pennsylvania assembly plant.
   That leaves Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor
Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp. _ all strong Japanese competitors as
importers and all promising strong futures as domestic makers.
   So far, the UAW represents only Mazda and one of Toyota's two
U.S. plants.
   By 1990, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries, the
maker of Subaru, and Isuzu Motor Co. also will be building cars in
this country.
   That means although the UAW will be bargaining with the Big
Three simultaneously in 1990, it must face competitive market
realities it may have ignored before 1979.
   The pattern contract is helping reshape Big Three labor and
management through 1990 so the companies can survive the
increasingly intensive competition on their home soil.
   ``The union and the companies are riding down a rough river with
rapids and rocks ahead _ in the same raft. They know that if either
kicks a hole in the bottom, they'll sink together,'' said David
Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive
Transportation at the University of Michigan in Dearborn.
   Chrysler's 66,000-worker contract must be approved today by
leaders of its local unions before it can be presented to the rank
and file for ratification.
   The contract gives workers greater job security. In turn, it
gives the automakers a chance to use workers more flexibly by
removing national union leaders' opposition to Japanese-style work
agreements negotiated at the plant level.
   Furthermore, while basic wage levels are the same at all three
companies, workers' earnings can vary by an unprecedented amount
from company to company because of a profit-sharing formula.
   The formula generated nearly $4,000 a worker at Ford from 1987
profits, $1,500 for Chrysler workers _ paid as a $500 bonus from a
previous contract and a $1,000 contract-signing bonus _ and nothing
for GM workers.
   In the past, the purpose of pattern bargaining was to remove
wages from competition _ essentially saying the Big Three could
compete among each other on the basis of productivity and quality,
but could not compete on the basis of wage costs, said Harley
Shaiken, labor and technology expert at the University of
California at San Diego.
   Now, part of workers' annual pay is dependent on their
companies' performance.
   ``We've seen a tremendous increase in union emphasis on quality
issues. They're saying `If quality sells, we're going to support
everything in this company that improves quality because we know
it's going to affect our compensation,''' Cole said.
   Increasing recognition of the interdependence between management
and workers is key to the Big Three pattern. But at Chrysler, the
UAW took it a step farther, forbidding payment of cash or stock
executive bonuses in years when the profit-sharing formula
generates no payout for workers.
   The clause largely is symbolic: it doesn't affect payouts
promised in executives' contracts, limit the size of bonuses,
prevent lost bonuses from being recovered in later years or
prohibit stock options _ the main source of the whopping $17.9
million Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca took home in 1987.
   But, Cole said, it is a first step toward making sure executives
and hourly workers ``understand they are all playing the same
game.''

<HEAD>Coal Talks Take New Twist As Miners Work With No Contract At
Pittston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the last contract between the United
Mine Workers and Pittston Coal Group Inc. ran out earlier this
year, people in the southern Appalachian coalfields braced for a
potentially violent strike.
   But this past weekend marked three months that some 2,000 UMW
members have remained on the job with no contract at Pittston's
mines in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   There have been no bombings, no sabotage, no snipings, and no
strike.
   Instead, both sides have waged corporate and public relations
campaigns while contract talks plod along on a two-days-a-week
circuit that alternates between Norton, Va.; Charleston, W.Va.; and
Washington, D.C.
   The company also has changed its tight-lipped media stance of
the past in favor of an unprecedented openness that has been dubbed
``coalfield glasnost,'' in reference to the Soviet Union's new
self-stated policy of openness.
   Neither side seems able to predict where this new type of labor
battle will lead in an industry where just a few years ago union
miners would not have worked a minute without a contract.
   ``I think that unions are becoming more inclined to do that
today,'' Pittston Coal President Gene Matthis said in a recent
interview from his Lebanon, Va., office.
   The negotiations mark the first time Pittston, a subsidiary of
Greenwich, Conn.-based Pittston Co., has tried to reach its own
contract with the UMW. Last May, the company dropped out of the
industry group that has done the bargaining on past contracts, the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   In February, for the second straight contract, the BCOA reached
a new UMW pact without a strike, but Pittston would not go along.
   UMW leaders repeatedly have accused Pittston of trying to break
the union, a charge Matthis denies. Matthis also disputes the
suggestion that Pittston may be winning the battle by keeping
employees on the job with no contract.
   ``I don't think that it gives us an upper hand,'' Matthis said.
``We still have to hammer out an agreement.''
   UMW officials claim Pittston refuses to bargain in good faith.
But although the UMW negotiating team has the authority to call
strikes at any or all of Pittston's mines, it has not done so.
   Instead of striking, the union has launched a corporate
campaign, aimed at putting pressure on Pittston in the boardroom
instead of at the mines.
   This past week, union members and supporters protested Pittston
twice in Richmond, demonstrating against the re-election of
Pittston Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Paul W. Douglas to the
board of Philip Morris and then at the offices of Pittston lender
Crestar Bank.
   The union also has demonstrated at the New York offices of Chase
Manhattan Bank, another Pittston lender, and union officials have
contacted state government officials in Michigan, one of Pittston's
biggest stockholders.
   Matthis said he has gotten no heat from the corporate campaign.
He could not say if any waves have been made with his superiors at
the Greenwich headquarters. A spokesman there did not return a
phone call.
   Union officials say their corporate attacks on Pittston are not
entirely new to the labor movement, but they certainly are
different from the violent strikes of the past.
   During a rally in Lebanon earlier this year, while guitarists
sang old labor ballads, UMW International President Richard Trumka
lashed out at Pittston in the language of the modern business
world. He blasted the parent corporation for setting up ``golden
parachute'' severance agreements for its executives and accused
Pittston of trying to force a bad deal on miners to make its coal
operations bear the costs of unwise acquisitions in the air freight
business.
   UMW spokesman Ken Zinn said the union has tried to convince
banks to let Pittston know that settling with the union would be in
its best interest.
   ``The loan they have extended to Pittston is a high-risk one,''
Zinn said. He said the company's working capital has plummeted from
$90 million in 1984 to $2.1 million last year. Moody's Investor
Service has downgraded Pittston's debt rating during that time.
   ``They lost over $133 million last year,'' Zinn said. ``They
haven't paid a dividend to their stockholders in the last five
years.''
   The union tells the banks that if Pittston is struck, its
moneymaking coal operations could suffer, making debt repayment
impossible. Pittston has said it would operate through a strike.
   Zinn declined comment on whether the corporate campaign was
working. Other UMW officials have said they believe a strike is
inevitable, but they won't say when.

<HEAD>Allegheny Creditors Seeking To Halt Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy court judge has scheduled a
hearing on a request by Allegheny International Inc.'s unsecured
creditors to halt a proxy fight being waged by two investment firms
for control of the company.
   Judge Joseph Cosetti set a hearing for next Thursday over the
creditors' request to block the firms, Spear Leeds & Kellogg and
Bomar Holdings, from trying to gain control of the 13-member board
in a May 20 shareholder vote.
   The dissident firms contend Allegheny International's top
managers are more interested in keeping their jobs than in
preserving shareholders' interests as the company reorganizes under
federal bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   The firms are trying gain seven seats on the company's board.
   On Thursday, Allegheny International announced it planned to
send letters to shareholders urging them to oppose the dissident
shareholders group. But the company later said it had canceled
those plans.
   Allegheny International's prime businesses are the consumer
products produced by Sunbeam, Oster, Northern Electric,
Almet-Lawnlite, Springfield Instrument, Soloray and Hanson Scale.

   A special service offered to stamp collectors
could make it possible for late taxpayers to mail their returns
this month and still beat the April 15 filing deadline, but
government officials say the practice is questionable.
   People using the special ``First Day of Issue'' service can
still get envelopes with postmarks dated in March, Linn's Stamp
News, a newspaper for collectors, points out in its May 9 edition.
   The way it works is that the Postal Service allows collectors to
buy stamps, put them on envelopes, and mail the envelopes in bulk
to the post office where the first-day ceremonies were held.
   The first-day cancellations are then affixed, often as much as a
month after the event, and the envelopes returned to the collector.
   This is done for stamp collectors, since most of them are unable
to travel to each city where new stamps may be issued, and the new
stamps cannot be purchased in other cities until the day after
issue.
   Offering the first-day cancellations for 30 days or so takes
pressure off the issuing post office and gives collectors time to
buy the new stamps and send them in for the cancellations.
   Thus, a collector could put the new ``E'' stamps on an envelope
containing tax forms, send it to Washington for the first day
cancellation, and it would then be delivered with the date March 22
on the envelope.
   The deadline for First Day cancellations of the ``E'' stamps is
May 21, slightly longer than normal because of the short notice
before the stamps were put on sale.
   The ``E'' stamps were issued March 22 in anticipation of new
postage rates, which took effect April 3.
   Technically, then, a taxpayer could still send in the forms ``on
time,'' under court decisions that have held a postmark is evidence
of filing.
   But Dick Rustin, manager of the post office's stamp information
branch, says cancellations for the first day of issue look
different and are treated differently from regular-date
cancellations affixed to mail.
   Regular cancellations do confirm the date something was mailed,
he said. But, for those which state ``first day of issue,'' he
said, ``we would not verify that the mail entered the system on
that day.''
   Generally collectors send in envelopes addressed to themselves
for these cancellations, he said.
   Rustin said postal officials might raise a question and contact
a collector ``if it appeared obvious that their intent'' in getting
the special cancellation was to defraud. But, he added, ``we're not
a police state, either.''
   Tax forms arriving a month late with a March 22 cancellation
might also raise questions at the IRS, said spokeswoman Johnell
Hunter. She said the tax agency might check to see if the
individual sending in the form had a history of being late.
   The IRS says perhaps 3 million tax forms have yet to be sent in,
although many of those are for Americans who live overseas and have
more than a month left to file.

<HEAD>Unemployment Rate Slips In April</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with April unemployment, new
jobs figures; uppicks 2nd graf pvs: On Wall...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The national unemployment rate has hit its lowest level since
June 1974, dropping to 5.4 percent in April, the government said
today.
   With 606,000 people finding jobs, the number of unemployed
Americans fell by 191,000 to just over 6.6 million, shaving 0.2
percentage point from March's 5.6 percent level.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a gain of 175,000
jobs in April, more than one-fourth of them on factory assembly
lines in industries that have increased their exports in recent
months.
   The Labor Deparment's figures came one day after the nation's
largest retailers issued April sales figures that analysts
described as disappointing.
   On Wall Street, stocks fell Thursday for the second consecutive
session as traders awaited today's report on April employment. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.08 points to close
at 2,020.23, following a 22.05-point retreat on Wednesday.
   The sluggish April retail sales results were blamed on cool
weather and the early arrival of Easter this year, which pushed
spring shopping into March. Although several major retailers
reported their sales rose during the month from a year earlier, the
gains were deemed lackluster.
   Jeffrey B. Edelman, a retail industry analyst with the
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the sales
increases were ``below expectations.''
   ``Put it all together, it's a dismal picture,'' said Linda
Kristiansen, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said its
overall sales rose 4.8 percent from April 1987, while sales from
stores open at least a year were up 2 percent for the month.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 2.5 percent last month,
but the so-called same-store sales fell 0.6 percent. Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. said its overall sales climbed 32 percent in April
while same-store sales rose 12 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which emphasizes its apparel lines, saw
sales decline by 0.4 percent last month.
   In other economic news on Thursday:
   _The nation's money supply rose sharply in the week ended April
25, the government reported. The increase had no impact on
financial markets and was regarded by economists as largely
inconsequential.
   _Assets of the nation's 426 money market mutual funds rose
$611.7 million in the week ended Wednesday to $273.61 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said. The increase followed a revised
$1.47 billion decline the previous week, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said.
   _Ward's Automotive Reports said domestic automakers were
scheduled to produce 249,292 cars and trucks this week, virtually
unchanged from last week's 249,889.

   A federal judge has dismissed the claims of some
of the bondholders suing the Washington Public Power Supply System
over the scrapping of two nuclear plants.
   Judge William Browning, at a pretrial hearing in Seattle
Thursday, granted a defense motion ruling out the damage claims of
people who bought bonds used to finance the plants, Nos. 4 and 5,
but who bought them after the projects were stopped in early 1982.
   Browning appeared to reverse an earlier decision in which he
included bondholders who had bought bonds for the plants between
Jan. 22, 1983, when the projects were terminated, and June 15,
1983, when the Washington Supreme Court invalidated the agreements
under which the projects were financed.
   It was not immediately clear how many of the approximately
35,000 bondholders in the suit were removed by the ruling. Clearing
Up, an energy and utility newsletter published in Seattle, last
September placed the number of ``post-termination'' bondholders at
4,800.
   The ruling pleased defense attorneys, who maintained that after
WPPSS terminated Plants 4 and 5, bond buyers should have been aware
WPPSS was having difficulties.
   The suit alleges WPPSS, underwriters and others misled bond
investors by withholding information about WPPSS' financial
problems and alleged mismanagement of the projects.
   But after the projects were scrapped, ``the (bond) market was
aware of the matters that the plaintiffs were claiming had been
concealed,'' said David Jurca, attorney for a group of utilities.
   Arthur Hoffer, a Hauppauge, N.Y., resident who chairs a national
committee of WPPSS bondholders, said the judge should have kept
bondholders in the case based on how much each knew about WPPSS
problems when they invested.
   The Washington Public Power Supply System, headquartered in
Richland, attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s
to serve Northwest customers. Of those, one plant, WPPSS No. 2 at
the Hanford nuclear reservation, is operating.
   Two others, WPPSS No. 1 at Hanford and No. 3 at Satsop, west of
Olympia, were mothballed while still unfinished in the early 1980s.
   WPPSS terminated its other two plants, No. 4 at Hanford and No.
5 at Satsop, in 1982, after $2.25 billion had been invested.
   Termination of the plants eventually resulted in default on the
$2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance the construction of WPPSS
Nos. 4 and 5. It was the biggest default in the history of the
municipal bond market.
   Most of the litigation has been consolidated in one case that is
set to go to trial on Sept. 1 in Tucson, Ariz., if an out-of-court
settlement cannot be reached.

   A federal judge will hear a Texaco
Inc. lawsuit against Carl C. Icahn by June 3, four days before the
oil giant's annual meeting at which Icahn has threatened to stage a
fight for five board seats.
   But attorneys for both sides said Thursday they hope to have the
suit resolved before then.
   Texaco has sued the takeover specialist over alleged violations
of federal securities laws. Among other things, the lawsuit seeks
to void a slate of directors that Icahn its largest shareholder, is
seeking to elect to the company's 14-member board at Texaco's June
7 meeting in Tulsa, Okla.
   Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco's stock, has maintained
that the company was badly run and should be restructured or sold.
He has offered to withdraw his slate if the company puts itself up
for sale at at least $55 per share. Texaco's management refuses to
to do that.
   His lead lawyer, Raymond Falls, told U.S. District Judge Geard
Goettel that the two sides would file pre-hearing materials by May
27.
   Goettel set a hearing for June 3, but said the hearing could
occur as early as May 31.
   Texaco's suit, filed Tuesday, charged that Icahn, his associates
and companies he controls used ``deceptive and manipulative means''
to either force the company to pay greenmail, force its sale to a
third party, or to acquire it in order to break it up and sell the
pieces, ``in each case thereby obtaining vast profits for
themselves in disregard of federal law and the long-term interest
of the shareholders.''
   Greenmail refers to a transaction whereby a target company buys
back its stock held by an unwanted suitor at a premium price not
available to all shareholders.
   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy code a year ago. It emerged last month and
has launched a restructuring plan that includes the sale of $5
billion in assets.
   The bankruptcy was brought on by a 1985 Houston jury ruling that
it had improperly interfered with a Pennzoil Co. acquisition of
part of Getty Oil Co., then bought Getty itself.
   The jury awarded Pennzoil $10.53 billion, an amount that had
been reduced through court action to $10.3 billion when Texaco
filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 12, 1987.
   Dennis O'Dea, the attorney who represented the shareholders
committee during the oil company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, said the committee was ``caught in the middle'' of the
litigation.
   Another attorney, Stanley Bernstein, told Goettel that he was
representing a class of shareholders who planned to sue Icahn,
charging that Icahn manipulated stock prices when he bought shares
from Bernstein's clients.
   Bernstein said the suit would be filed in the next few days,
seeking damages for shareholders who claim they did not receive
fair prices because of Icahn's alleged manipulation of the market.

   British industrialist Brian C. Beazer offered
employees of Koppers Co. unspecified job guarantees in exchange for
a friendly merger with the cement concern.
   Koppers did not immediately respond to the offer, made in a
letter dated Thursday. Beazer, together with the investment bank
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a British bank, has a hostile
$1.7-billion tender offer on the table.
   Beazer wrote that in exchange for ``an immediate merger
agreement that avoids further waste and delay, we will offer
substantial and important employment guarantees to every single
employee ... other than senior management.''
   Beazer spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said today from New York that
she could not elaborate on whether Beazer is offering guaranteed
employment, severance pay or some other form of compensation.
   The chairman of the British construction company Beazer PLC said
he was renewing an earlier invitation to negotiate, which Koppers
rejected, in order to quell employees' fears that jobs will be cut
after a takeover and to ``end further senseless and expensive
litigation.''
   That litigation has resulted in federal court orders in
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles blocking the $60-per-share tender offer,
which is set to expire May 18 unless extended.
   Beazer claims that as of May 4, nearly 16.4 million common
shares had been tendered. Those shares combined with the two
million shares the group already owns represent 65.7 percent of
Koppers' outstanding common shares, he has said.
   ``An overwhelming majority of your shareholders wish to accept
our offer,'' Beazer said. ``They obviously prefer it to your
mythical recapitalization.''
   Koppers management has said it is studying various restructuring
plans in order to boost stock value.

   The stock market staged a modest rally today in
a muted response to the latest news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.31 to 2,024.54 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 541 up, 351
down and 480 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.19 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6
percent the month before.
   There had been concern on Wall Street that stocks might suffer a
setback on signs of continuing strength in the economy, because of
concern that upward pressure might be increasing on inflation and
interest rates.
   However, the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of
174,000 came in toward the low end of advance estimates.
   And analysts said it looked as though stocks had taken into
account any worries the job data might pose with their decline
Wednesday and Thursday.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up { at 44]; USX,
up ] at 32[; American Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at 26\, and
Bethlehem Steel, up ] at 19{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.28 to 146.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .03 at 302.36.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.08 to
2,020.23, bringing its loss over the past two sessions to 38.13
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 558 up, 904 down and 507 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 171.84 million shares, against 141.32 million in the
previous session.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and South Korean negotiators said
Friday they reached agreement on cigarette imports and made
progress on other issues in five days of trade talks aimed at
opening the South Korean market to American goods.
   Local trade analysts estimated that U.S. cigarettes could
capture 10 percent of the South Korean market as a result of the
agreement.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in
addition to full agreement on cigarettes, there was ``good
progress'' on other issues such as agricultural products and
intellectual property rights.
   ``The talks were more organizational than before and the results
were very good,'' said the official. However, the agreements still
must be approved by senior officials in each government.
   The U.S. side declined to disclose details of the talks, but
South Korean officials said they agreed to allow greater American
cigarette sales by lowering prices and ending most sales
restrictions.
   South Korean officials said the prices of foreign cigarettes
would be lowered from the present $1.76 per pack to $1.03 effective
July 1. The prices could go down further next year after South
Korea revises its laws, cutting tariffs and various excise taxes
levied on tobacco, they said.
   The U.S. government has been pressing South Korea to cut its
growing trade surplus by opening its market wider to foreign goods
and services.
   South Korea opened 1 percent of its $2.1 billion cigarette
market last September, but U.S. cigarette sales have remained below
the quota.
   Under the agreement reached this week, import quotas and sales
restrictions on imported cigarettes will be abolished. After next
year, foreign exporters will be able to set their own retail
prices, officials said.
   U.S. negotiators also sought to open the South Korean market to
54 American agricultural products, but South Korea agreed only to
allow imports of avocados, meat extracts, most vegetable juices and
frozen potatoes for use in French fries, effective July 1.
   South Korea agreed to honor U.S. intellectual property rights
for 911 ``pipeline products,'' which are patented in the United
States but not yet sold in South Korea, for 10 years, retroactive
from last year, the officials said.
   No agreement was reached, however, on wine and advertising, for
which the United States sought to open the South Korean market
immediately, the officials said.
   South Korea said it would open its wine market in 1990, one year
ahead of schedule, but proposed no specific time frame for
advertising, they said.
   The talks, originally scheduled to run from Monday to Wednesday,
were extended until Friday to solve last-minute differences on
cigarettes and other issues.

   The stock market showed some scattered gains
today in a muted response to the latest news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.45 to 2,028.68 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 699 up, 429
down and 549 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.37 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6
percent the month before.
   There had been concern on Wall Street that stocks might suffer a
setback on signs of continuing strength in the economy, because of
concern that upward pressure might be increasing on inflation and
interest rates.
   However, the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of
174,000 came in toward the low end of advance estimates.
   And analysts said it looked as though stocks had taken into
account any worries the job data might pose with their decline
Wednesday and Thursday, when the Dow Jones industrials dropped
38.13 points.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up 1 at 44~; USX,
up { at 32\; American Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at 26\, and
Bethlehem Steel, up ] at 19{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.69 to 147.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .13 at 302.52.

<HEAD>Agency Estimate: OPEC Oil Output Up To 18.2 Million Barrels Daily
In April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   April oil production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries rose from March by a half-million
barrels daily, to 18.2 million barrels a day, the International
Energy Agency estimated Friday.
   The April figure includes a daily output of 2.6 million barrels
by Iraq, which is not a signatory to the group's current production
sharing program.
   That meant that OPEC's other 12 members were pumping 15.6
million barrels daily, slightly above their official combined quota
of 15.06 million barrels daily.
   Daily production gains, compared with March, included:
   _Saudi Arabia _ 4.3 million barrels from 4.2 million barrels.
   _Iran, 2.2 million barrels from 2.1 million.
   _United Arab Emirates, 1.3 million barrels from 1.2 million, and
   _Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels from 1.1 million barrels.
   _Iraq, 2.6 million barrels from 2.4 million barrels.
   Only Kuwait lowered its daily output, to 1.0 million barrels
daily from 1.1 million barrels in March, while all other
signatories to the current output agreement held their output
steady in April, the IEA said.
   Global oil supply during April was estimated by the agency at
48.7 million barrels a day, up from 48.5 million barrels daily in
March.
   The modest rise was led by higher OPEC output and a rise in
exports by East Bloc countries to 2.0 million barrels a day from
1.8 million barrels daily, the agency said.
   These elements were partly offset, however, by a drop in daily
output by countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, to 16.6 million barrels from 17.0 million barrels
in March.
   The agency said the OECD decline, in part, reflected the
beginning of maintenance work on the North Sea.
   The IEA did not release monthly consumption estimates for April.
   But it said it made an upward revison of its first-quarter OECD
demand estimates to 36.9 million barrels a day from 36.6 million
barrels a day previously.
   The revised first-quarter figure is up 1.7 percent from a year
earlier and mainly reflects unusually cold weather in North
America, which boosted consumption there by about 5 percent over
the previous year.
   Consumption growth in North America in the first quarter was led
by heavy fuel oil and heating oil, it said, noting that gasoline
use was also higher.
   European conumption was generally lower in the first quarter,
attributable to mild winter weather. Consumption in the Pacific
region was up about 2 percent from the first quarter of 1987.
   Following the first-quarter increase in OECD demand, the agency
said it expects consumption from these countries to show a rise of
between 1 and 1.5 percent for 1988. This would be higher than its
previous estimate of 1 percent growth for the year.
   The latest forecast is based on assumptions of 3 percent
economic growth in the OECD for 1988 and end-user prices holding
near current levels for the rest of the year.
   The agency estimated that oil stocks on land in the OECD totaled
the equivalent of 102 days of forward consumption.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat was a little lower, corn was
nearly unchanged, and soybeans were slightly higher.
   The modest rally in the soybean complex was led by soybean meal,
which enjoyed fairly strong European demand, analysts said.
   Weather forecasts reducing the amount of rain expected to fall
over the weekend in soybean-growing states lent further support to
the soybean complex.
   Some chart theorists believe soybean futures may be nearing the
end of their recent rise, said Steve Freed, an analyst in Chicago
with the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``I think we're going to make one more attempt at contract
highs, then we'll be done for a while,'' he said.
   Wheat and corn retreated in response to slack export demand,
analysts said. Wheat also was pressured by expectations of a
bountiful winter wheat harvest.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $2.96 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $2.03\ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $1.61 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with May at $6.91{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at
72.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with May at 79.60 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with June at 51.40 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .07 cent to .27 cent lower with May at 52.15 cents a
pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>Poll: Financial Managers Expect Growth for at Least Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate financial managers expect continued
economic growth for at least 12 more months, but many foresee a
mild recession after that, according to a poll by a trade group.
   The National Association of Accountants said 29 percent of its
3,200 corporate controller members responded to the survey, which
was conducted in the third week of April.
   Of those, 65 percent said they expected the economy to be the
same or better in one year, while 35 percent said they foresaw
worse conditions.
   Asked if they predicted a recession in 1988, 86 percent of the
respondents said no.
   But the balance shifted for 1989, with 65 percent predicting a
recession will occur sometime next year. Of that number, however,
78 percent said they expected the downturn to be mild.
   The Montvale, N.J.-based accountants group, which has a total of
85,000 members, asked the corporate controllers to rank the top
three factors they felt would have the greatest impact on the
economy through October.
   Interest rates drew the greatest number of replies, at 62
percent, followed by the federal budget deficit, at 59 percent. The
fluctuation and decline of the dollar was third, at 48 percent,
followed by the trade deficit (38 percent) and election campaigning
(35 percent).
   The controllers' near-term outlook on the stock market was
cautiously bullish. With the Dow Jones industrial average hovering
at about 2,000 at the time of the poll, 20 percent said they
expected it to be around the same level by June 30, and 51 percent
predicted a 2,100 or higher level. Twenty-nine percent predicted
the average would be lower.
   By overwhelming margins, the controllers said they expected
their companies to record higher sales and profits for 1988,
compared with 1987. In both categories, a majority predicted gains
of 10 percent.
   Capital expenditures were expected to remain the same or
increase in the second half of the year by 73 percent of the survey
respondents.
   Among other key indicators:
   _73 percent said they expected inflation to run between 4
percent and 5 percent through next April.
   _Half predicted higher short-term interest rates through the
rest of 1988, while only 8 percent foresaw a decline; 42 percent
said they expected rates to remain stable.
   _51 percent saw higher long-term interest rates in the same
period, vs. 8 percent predicting a decline and 41 percent expecting
stability.
   _Employment was expected to remain steady through October at 47
percent of the controllers' firms. Thirty-eight percent predicted
an increase, with the heavy emphasis in hiring going toward
production and clerical-administrative jobs.

<HEAD>Two Former Bankers Face Retrial In Federal Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say they have decided to retry two
former bank executives whose first trial on federal fraud charges
related to the near-collapse of Continental Illinois National Bank
and Trust Co. resulted in a hung jury.
   John Lytle, a former Continental vice president, and William
Patterson, former head of energy lending at Penn Square Bank of
Oklahoma, will be retried on 11 counts of bank fraud, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Duffy.
   ``These defendants deserve to be held accountable for their
actions,'' he said.
   Prosecutors have charged that Lytle accepted kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for buying Penn Square loans that violated
Continental's lending policies. The kickbacks came in the form of
nearly $600,000 in unsecured personal loans extended to Lytle by
Penn Square, prosecutors contend.
   But jurors who heard the lengthy trial failed to reach a verdict
against Lytle and Patterson and a mistrial was declared on Tuesday.
   A third defendant, Tulsa oil contractor Jere Sturgis, was
acquitted. He had been accused of aiding the alleged scheme by
purchasing oil wells from Lytle at a 300 percent return in hopes of
obtaining a Continental loan.
   Duffy said the overwhelming majority of jurors in favor of
convicting Lytle and Patterson was a factor in the decision to
retry the case.
   ``The fact it was 11-to-1 demonstrates the strength of the case
and that we were able to convince 11 people beyond a reasonable
doubt,'' he said.
   Penn Square collapsed in July 1982 under the weight of energy
loans it could not collect. In 1984, Continental needed a $4.5
billion government bailout to survive one of the largest runs on
deposits in banking history.

<HEAD>Children's Book Publisher Says It's Talking With Gulf & Western</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Publishing Group Inc., a children's book
and printing company, says it is discussing a possible merger with
Gulf & Western Inc., the entertainment concern that been expanding
its publishing interests.
   Both companies noted, however, that there were a number of
issues still open and there were no assurances an agreement would
be reached.
   Western Publishing disclosed a week ago it was taking about a
possible merger with an unidentified company.
   On Thursday, it said the talks were with Gulf & Western, which
subsequently confirmed that preliminary discussions were under way.
   Western Publishing said there were unresolved tax issues arising
from the proposed combination, but said its board wanted to
continue the talks with Gulf & Western on a non-exclusive basis.
   Before any transaction is completed, Western said, it intends to
spin off its Penn Corp. division to its shareholders.
   The Penn division makes party goods such as napkins and plates
and also makes pens and creates vinyl products that can be
imprinted with various corporate names and logos for use as
giveaways.
   Western Publishing said its board intended to review the status
of merger negotiations and the proposed spinoff of Penn in about
two weeks.
   In trading at midday Friday, Gulf & Western was up 50 cents a
share to $38.12{ in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while
Western Publishing was off $1 a share at $22.25 in over-the-counter
trading.
   Western Publishing is best known for its Golden Book series for
children, has an extensive distibution system for its books,
puzzles, games and crayons and is a major commercial printer.
   For its fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Western earned $21.6 million,
or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $457.4 million.
   The company said that if Penn had been a separate company last
year, Pennt would have reported on a pro-forma basis pre-tax income
of $1.4 million on revenue of $71 million.
   Western was acquired by Mattel Inc. in 1979, was taken private
five years later and emerged again as a public company in 1986.
   Gulf & Western has spent more than $1 billion over the last few
years to expand its publishing business.
   A longtime owner of Simon & Schuster, which publishes books for
mass circulation, Gulf & Western bought the elementary school
publisher Esquire Inc. and the college and professional business
publisher Prentice-Hall Inc. in 1984.
   It bought Ginn & Co., an elementary and high school publisher,
in 1985 and acquired Silver Burdett Co., an elementary textbook
publisher in May 1986.
   Gulf & Western also has extensive interests in entertainment and
financial services.

   Northwest Airlines has denied a Teamsters
union claim that it ordered female flight attendants not to eat hot
dogs or ice cream cones while in uniform because it may be sexually
suggestive.
   The Teamsters union, which represents the airline's flight
attendants, said an employee bulletin circulated at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport contained the directive. The airline says the
bulletin is a fake.
   ``That's absurd,'' Northwest spokesman Redmond Tyler said. ``We
certainly don't have a policy of this type.''
   Tyler said Northwest's Detroit base manager, Wendy Wells, and
some uniformed flight attendants will eat hot dogs and ice cream at
the airport.
   Teamsters spokesman Ken Daugherty said the policy came out in
the monthly Northwest Detroit Inflight, a newsletter for employees.
   He said it was signed by Wells, but Wells called the document a
fake.
   Daugherty did not return a telephone call this morning seeking
comment on Northwest's response.
   Northwest operates one of its three hubs nationwide from Detroit.

   Share prices on the London stock exchange rose
Friday, boosted by gains in early trading on Wall Street and a
flurry of markups after the start of a new trading account.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
rose 11.6 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1801.1.
   Speculative stocks remained in the spotlight, accounting for
much of the day's trading volume and the major stock price moves.
   But dealers also reported some new institutional buying
interest. A bullish report on the British equity market, issued by
Nomura Research Institute, gave a boost to investor sentiment, they
said. The report also was perceived as encouraging Japanese
investors to invest in London, they said.
   Later, shares gained some more when Wall Street shrugged off
mixed signals about the U.S. economy in the form of unemployment
data for April. And the start of a new two-week trading account
brought a wave of markups by market makers, with virtually no
selling pressure to bring prices back down, dealers said.

<HEAD>Help-Wanted Ads Little Changed In March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While businesses placed slightly more
help-wanted advertisements in March than they did in February, the
volume of ads has basically remained unchanged since November, a
business information group reported Friday.
   The Conference Board said its seasonally adjusted Help Wanted
Advertising Index rose 3 points in March to 159.
   The index, which measures the volume of classified advertising
in 51 major newspapers around the nation, is an indicator of
changes in demand for labor and general business conditions.
   ``Want-ad volume peaked in November 1987 (at 164) and has been
basically marking time since then,'' said board economist Kenneth
Goldstein.
   ``The consensus of economic forecasts indicates the unemployment
rate will inch up from 5.6 percent in March to 6.3 percent this
summer, and the latest readings on help-wanted advertising are
certainly not consistent with that scenario,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment
fell in April to 5.4 percent, the lowest it has been since 1974.
   The Conference Board said advertising volume rose modestly
around the nation in March, picking up most in the Pacific region,
with a 3.3 percent gain, and least in the Middle Atlantic Region,

   The stock market drifted lower today in a muted
response to the latest news on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.64 to 2,013.59
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 630 up, 792 down and
525 unchanged.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6
percent the month before.
   There had been concern on Wall Street that stocks might suffer a
substantial setback on signs of continuing strength in the economy,
because of concern that upward pressure might be increasing on
inflation and interest rates.
   However, the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of
174,000 came in toward the low end of advance estimates.
   And analysts said it looked as though stocks had taken into
account most of the worries the job data might pose with their
decline Wednesday and Thursday, when the Dow Jones industrials
dropped 38.13 points.
   Among actively traded blue chips, USX rose ] to 32[; American
Express was unchanged at 23|; American Telephone & Telegraph
dropped [ to 26, and General Electric lost ] to 39|.
   Micron Technology rose 1\ to 22} on large volume in the
over-the-counter market. The stock has recently been recommended by
investment adviser Yale Hirsch and oter analysts as a beneficiary
of heavy demand and rising prices for computer memory chips.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.24 to 146.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .45 at 301.94.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.65 million shares with an
hour to go.

   The stock market posted its third straight loss
in slow trading today, faced with employment statistics that raised
fears of tighter credit and higher interest rates.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6
percent the month before.
   Wall Street had been warily awaiting the figures for several
days, worrying that signs of continuing strength in the economy
would be read as a portent of increasing upward pressure on
inflation and interest rates.
   At first, the market advanced on the news, apparently because
the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 174,000 came
in toward the low end of advance estimates.
   But as the session passed, prices headed lower while bond prices
dropped and analysts described the job data as a likely negative
for the inflation outlook.
   ``Hourly earnings rose a disquieting 0.5 percent,'' said
economists at Merrill Lynch in their initial appraisal of the
report. ``Tight labor markets will lead to further wage gains and
rising inflation this year.''

<HEAD>Jacobs Suchard Raises Stake in Rowntree to 29.9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacobs Suchard SA, a Swiss food and confectionery
maker, raised its stake Friday in the British confectioner Rowntree
PLC to 29.9 percent, the maximum allowed under British law short of
a full takeover bid.
   Jacobs Suchard has paid an estimated 450 million pounds, or $841
million, for the Rowntree shares, which it has acquired gradually
since it accumulated a 14.9 percent stake on April 13. It held a
23.5 percent stake on Wednesday.
   A full Jacobs Suchard bid would have to top the 2.1
billion-pound takeover bid for Rowntree launched last week by rival
Swiss foods giant Nestle SA.
   Nestle has built up a 7.1 percent holding in Rowntree, or 15.4
million of the company's 215 million shares.
   London analysts said they doubted Jacobs Suchard would try to
outbid Nestle in a takeover battle for Rowntree.
   ``My guess is that they will use the stake as some sort of lever
against Nestle,'' said John Mozley, an analyst at the brokerage
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   Jacobs Suchard could use its stake to force a higher offer from
Nestle or gain some influence over the future management of the
company, but it declined to comment on its next move.
   ``We won't reveal our strategy,'' a company spokesman said.
   Nestle wrote Friday to Rowntree shareholders recommending they
accept the Nestle offer. Nestle stressed the company's role as a
food manufacturer in Britain in an apparent effort to deflect
mounting criticism in Britain of the takeover bid.
   ``We have the resources to help Rowntree grow faster than it
could on its own, particularly in Europe and the U.S.,'' wrote
Nestle managing director Helmut Maucher.
   Nestle said it was not worried about the possibility that a
takeover could be referred to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to determine if the buyout would be in the public
interest.
   ``We have a lot of understanding for the fact that this
acquisition has some emotional value, but there is no monopoly
point of view that could be realistically justified,'' said Nestle
spokesman Francois Perroud.
   He said Nestle was not likely to make a new, higher offer for
Rowntree soon. ``It's a good price, a fair price, and there are a
lot of people suggesting it's actually too much to pay for
Rowntree,'' he said.
   Rowntree spokesman Gavin Russell said the company has not
directly approached the government to suggest the Swiss purchases
should be referred.
   It has relied instead on British legislators who are lobbying
the government to block the purchases, he said.

   Coleco Industries Inc., the company
that rocketed to super-stardom with its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls,
may need another miracle to recover from its current financial
problems.
   Unless it can restructure its $335 million debt and raise
working capital, Coleco could soon wind up in bankruptcy court
seeking protection from its creditors, said Morton E. Handel, who
was named this week to replace Arnold C. Greenberg as chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``I see myself under a very tight time deadline, measured in
days or weeks, in order to be able to resolve the problems
currently facing us,'' said Handel, 53, a 14-year Coleco veteran
and most recently the head of finances and investor relations.
   ``We're zealously trying to find some sources of working capital
in order to give us the opportunity to run the company and bring it
back to the point of profitability and viability,'' he said in an
interview.
   The company has proposed that investors who own its bonds
exchange those securities for 6 million shares of Coleco stock and
new bonds worth $119 million.
   The company is in default on the interest payments on its $335
million in debt and has set a deadline of May 13 for the exchange.
Coleco has also hired Cleveland-based Hallwood Group Inc. to help
it restructure its finances.
   ``Somebody obviously has a great sense of black humor since it's
Friday the 13th,'' David Leibowitz, senior vice president of
American Securities Corp. in New York, said Friday.
   In an effort to cut costs, Coleco this week laid off 475 workers
_ 45 percent of its total U.S. work force _ mostly at its three
manufacturing plants in the Albany, N.Y., area. That left it with
about 580 employees in the United States, compared with an average
of 2,500 in 1987.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
   Leibowitz and other analysts said the same aggressive management
style that helped Coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls in 1983 helped bring on the current woes.
   The dolls, which were introduced in 1983 after a number of other
toy companies rejected the product, helped Coleco end 1985 in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $776 million and
record earnings of $64 million.
   ``What went wrong? The company was just too aggressively run,''
said Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Corp. ``They
bet the ranch basically and lost. They waited until it was too late
to address their inflated costs and shore up their finances.''
   Valentine said he didn't blame Greenberg or any particular
product line, such as the toys based on the Rambo movie character
or the troubled Adam home computer. Rather, Coleco's woes stem from
a financial approach common in the toy industry, he said.
   ``They didn't cut their costs quickly enough after sales of the
Cabbage Patch dolls fell off sharply,'' he said. ``Like many toy
companies, Coleco had a cost structure which assumed only the
greatest success for the company's products.''
   The company, which became Coleco Industries in 1961, has faced
tough times before. It entered the snowmobile business in 1972, but
snowfalls were light for the next three years, the economy was
depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a $22 million loss in 1978, threatening its
survival. In 1980 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its
$600 Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost $79.8 million in 1984 despite $540 million in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.
   Valentine said he doesn't believe Coleco will have to file under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, saying investors have
appeared more willing in recent weeks to consummate the exchange.
He also predicted Coleco may sell off a toy line to raise some cash.
   If it can weather the current storm, Leibowitz said Coleco has a
strong enough product line to remain an industry leader.
   ``This is a company that has a strong pedigree in the business
and one is not going to write them off as a meaningful player in
the trade,'' he said. ``What we are saying is the overwhelming
consideration and the major concern right now is simply the ability
to keep the doors open and work out an accommodation.''

   Unemployment fell in April to 5.4 percent, the
lowest it has been since 1974, with export-led hiring on factory
assembly lines in the industrial heartland leading the latest spurt
of new jobs, the government said Friday.
   The number of Americans at work rose by 606,000 last month while
those listed as unemployed fell by 191,000 to 6.6 million, dropping
joblessness 0.2 percentage points from March's rate of 5.6 percent,
the Labor Department said.
   The rate was the lowest since June 1974 when it also stood at
5.4 percent but at time when the nation was well into a steep
recesssion, in contrast to the current economic expansion.
   ``One of the best barometers of the state of our economy is to
see more people working,'' President Reagan said in reaction to
Friday's report. ``The good news ... continues. The economy
continues to grow at a moderate pace and inflation is under
control.''
   Private analysts agreed, although some of them repeated
assertions they have been making since last September _ when the
jobless rate first dipped below 6 percent _ that the tighter labor
market is bound to push wages up soon and exert inflationary
pressures on prices as well.
   ``We have reached the zone of full employment when the jobless
rate is so low that wage inflation starts accelerating, and it
clearly is now,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist for The Boston
Co., a New York financial consultant.
   In another report adding to fears of inflation, the Federal
Reserve Board said consumer installment debt grew by $4.46 billion
in March, a strong annual rate of growth of 8.6 percent. Consumer
debt grew a 10.3 percent annual rate for the first three months of
the year, compared with 7.2 percent for all of 1987.
   The Labor Department said in its report on the job market that
the average hourly wage nationwide in April rose to $9.22, a nickel
over March, for an average annual increase of 5.6 percent. That is
twice the 2.8 percent average increase in hourly wages for all of
1987.
   Other economists, however, said the wage gains are still not big
enough to trigger a tightening of credit by the Federal Reserve
Board through higher interest rates in an effort to cool off the
economy.
   ``The fears of an inflationary boom are overstated,'' said Larry
Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., an
economic consulting firm. ``I don't think it will get out of hand.
Manufacturing is strong, but other areas of the economy such as
services, retailing and construction are showing some weakness.''
   Richard Rahn, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief economist,
said it is a myth that low unemployment causes inflation.
   ``The opposite is more often the case,'' he said. ``Since 1950
we have had 15 years when unemployment was at or below today's
rates. The average inflation rate in those years was 3.6 percent.
During the other 23 years when unemployment was above today's
number, inflation was a dramatic one-third higher or 4.8 percent.''
   Growth in new factory jobs, which had been sluggish the previous
three months after rising dramatically in 1987, accounted for more
than one-fourth of the 175,000 increase in employers' payrolls in
April.
   Leading the surge were export-related industries such as
machinery and fabricated metal products. But production jobs in the
U.S. auto industry also climbed by 10,000, reversing wide-scale
layoffs in January and February.
   Michigan's unemployment rate dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.4
percent, as did joblessness in several other states whose economies
are heavily dependent on manufacturing.
   The rates fell from 3.8 percent to 3.5 percent in New York, from
4 percent to 3.5 percent in New Jersey, from 7.7 percent to 6.3
percent in Ohio and from 5.1 percent to 4.8 percent in Pennsylvania.
   And nearly all of the jobless decline in April was among adult
men, who are more likely than women to work on the goods-producing
side of the economy as opposed to the service sectors.
   The jobless rate for adult men fell 0.3 percent points to 4.6
percent in April. For women, it remained unchanged at 4.8 percent.
   Hospital and business services and retail outlets such as stores
and restaurants which had been the hottest areas of job growth the
past year showed a total payroll gain of just 71,000 in April.
   The Labor Department said nearly all of the improvement in the
unemployment figures was among people who had been laid off from
their last jobs, as opposed to those who had quit or were seeking
employment for the first time.
   ``The number of unemployed job losers declined to slightly less
than 3 million and their proportion of the total jobless was at its
lowest point this decade, 44 percent,'' said Janet L. Norwood, the
commissioner of labor statistics.
   Growth in voluntary part-time jobs accounted for two-thirds of
the increase in the number of working Americans in April.
   ``We often fall into the trap of reacting negatively to any job
expansion that is not full time,'' Ms. Norwood told the
congressional Joint Economic Committee. ``But some one out of every
eight workers _ 15 million in all _ do not want full-time jobs.''
   The number of people working part-time because they could not
find full-time work actually fell by 150,000 last month to 5.2
million, still a ``level of concern,'' Ms. Norwood said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. said Friday its board
has approved a sweetened offer from its chairman, Carl C. Icahn,
for the shares in the company that he does not already own,
removing one barrier in his effort to take the airline private.
   The takeover specialist controls TWA through eltities that own
77 percent of its 30 million common shares outstanding. He dropped
a similar proposal after the Oct. 12 stock market crash, then came
back with a revised bid on April 22.
   Under the bid approved by TWA's board Friday, shareholders not
affiliated with Icahn would receive for each share of common stock
$20 in cash and $30 in face amount of 12 percent notes due in 2008.
   Those notes had carried a $29 face value in Icahn's April 22
offer.
   At the same time, the entities controlled by Icahn would
receive, for each common share, $20 in cash and a new issue of
preferred stock and a retained share of common stock, a TWA
statement said.
   Once completed, Icahn and entities controlled by him would own
about 90 percent of the airline's stock. The remaining shares would
be owned by an employee stock ownership plan.
   The airline also said that upon closure of the deal, it intended
to:
   _Pay off at least $64.5 million of debt.
   _Seek the consent of holders of some preferred stock to
eliminate voting rights on that stock and to exchange other
preferred issues for 12 percent notes.
   The transaction is subject to various conditions, including
regulatory clearance and approval by a majority vote of
shareholders unaffiliated with Icahn. A vote on the proposal is to
be conducted at TWA's annual meeting, to be held toward the end of
the year.
   TWA said an independent committee was selected by its board to
evaluate the fairness of both of Icahn proposals to the public
shareholdeps of TWA's common stock.
   ``The Independent Committee has determined that Icahn's revised
offer is fair to the public holders of TWA common stock from a
financial point of view and will recommend that the common
stockholders approve the transaction,'' the statement said.
   It added that the investment banking firm of Dillon, Read & Co.
Inc. had told the committee orally that the Icahn's latest offer
``is fair to public holders ... from a financial point of view.''
   Industry analysts had been generally positive about Icahn's
April 22 offer, putting a value on the combined package of cash and
note at levels between $35 and $45 per outstandinf share.
   That would make the offer worth at least $276 million, at $40
per share for the 6.9 million outstanding shares Icahn does not
already control.
   The April 22 offer sent TWA's stock up $7 a share to $35.12{.
The stock rose $1.12{ a share Friday to close at $35.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Despite the response in April, it appeared Icahn faced pressure
raise it anyway.
   ``He had several conversations with the investment bankers who
had been retained by the independent committee, and maybe they
persuaded him it should be made a little sweeter,'' said Mark
Buckstein, a TWA spokesman.
   John Pincavage, who watches TWA for the PaineWebber Inc.
securities firm, said Friday that he had priced the April offer at
$36 to $38 a share.
   ``So maybe this makes it $39,'' he said.
   ``I think it's a good deal for shareholders,'' Pincavage added.
``After all, Icahn could have bought it on the market at a lower
priae, if he wanted to.''

   Eastern Airlines sued two of its unions for $1.5
billion Friday, accusing its pilots and machinists of ``Eastern
bashing'' to drive down the carrier's value so they could buy it
cheaply on the stock market.
   In the latest of a series of court battles with labor,
Miami-based Eastern and parent company Texas Air Corp. allege the
International Association of Machinists and the Air Line Pilots
Association ``have campaigned to smear'' them.
   ``The smear campaign is one of a number of tactics to facilitate
a takeover,'' airline attorney Parker Folse III of Houston said of
the suit, filed in U.S. District Court here.
   Also Friday, Texas Air reported a $124.3 million loss for the
first three months of 1988 on revenues of $2.1 billion, vs. a loss
of $101 million on revenues of $2 billion for the same period a
year ago. Eastern had a $31 million loss for the first quarter,
compared with net income of $2.1 million in the same period in 1987.
   Eastern's ALPA chairman, John Bavis, among those named
individually in the suit, brushed it off as a company tactic to
divert attention from a U.S. Department of Transportation probe of
the carriers' finances and safety.
   ``This is like the lions suing the Christians for animal abuse.
The situation at Eastern today has been called the corporate
version of the battered child syndrome _ with the company being
mugged by its own parent, Texas Air,'' Bavis said.
   Machinist local President Charles Bryan said in Atlanta that the
lawsuit was an effort to shift public opinion, which he claimed had
been gaining momentum on the side of employees.
   ``It's clear evidence of a last-ditch effort by a very desperate
man, and that man's Frank Lorenzo,'' he said of Texas Air's owner.
The suit is ``a typical gesture on his (Lorenzo's) part, to blame
others for his problems,'' Bryan said.
   ALPA, the IAM and Eastern's Transport Worker Union tried to buy
the carrier before Texas Air bought it in 1986 for $676 million, a
sale they then tried to block. The suit says the two unions still
hope to obtain Eastern, which has lost $900 million in the past 10
years.
   ``They seek this by an all-out effort to injure Eastern's
business _ to make it a financial millstone for Texas Air _ by
means of ... mail fraud, wire fraud, extortion ... Further, they
have set out to destroy Eastern's good will and reputation,'' the
suit says.
   The suit also said that ``by promoting deceitful accusations
about the safety of Eastern, defendants have induced the news media
to join in an `Eastern bashing' effort, and have led the DOT and
the FAA to conduct costly investigations of the airline, all of
which have further damaged Eastern's business.
   ``Indeed, that is the precise objective of the smear campaign _
to drain Eastern of its economic vitality, and to continue draining
it until either Texas Air delivers the company into union hands or
Eastern is driven into bankruptcy.''
   If unable to obtain Eastern, the pilots and machinists ``are
prepared to destroy both companies,'' says the suit, which notes
the labor groups have consulted with T. Boone Pickens on a plan to
take over Texas Air for $1.2 billion.
   The suit is baseless, said John Edmond, a Washington lawyer for
the machinists. Their contract dispute with Eastern _ which seeks
wage cuts of up to 50 percent _ is in federal mediation.
   The unions have long contended that Texas Air and Lorenzo aim to
strip Eastern of its assets and bust its labor groups. Friday's
suit is another example, said Mary Jane Barry, president of the
TWU, which represents about 7,000 flight attendants and is not
named in the suit.
   ALPA's Bavis said the suit merely aims to divert attention from
the federal probes of Eastern, Texas Air and another of its
subsidiaries, Continental Airlines.
   Also last month, the Federal Aviation Administration announced
it was seeking $823,000 in penalties from Eastern for past safety
violations and it then began a plane-by-plane inspection of the
carrier. Last year, Eastern paid a $9.5 million fine for violations.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a
non-binding resolution on Thursday urging the Transportation
Department, parent of the FAA, to widen the probe of Eastern and
Texas Air to include how the public and workers might be affected
by company policies.

   The stock market lost ground for the third
straight session in slow trading Friday, faced with employment
statistics that raised fears of tighter credit and higher interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.77 to
2,007.46, bringing its loss for the week to 24.87 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 602 up, 845 down and 545 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 129.08 million shares, against 171.84
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index lost
.63 to 145.88.
   Before the market opened the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6
percent the month before.
   Wall Street had been warily awaiting the figures for several
days, worrying that signs of continuing strength in the economy
would be read as a portent of increasing upward pressure on
inflation and interest rates.
   At first, the market advanced on the news, apparently because
the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 174,000 came
in toward the low end of advance estimates.
   But as the session passed, prices headed lower while bond prices
dropped and analysts described the job data as a likely negative
for the inflation outlook.
   ``Hourly earnings rose a disquieting 0.5 percent,'' said
economists at Merrill Lynch in their initial appraisal of the
report. ``Tight labor markets will lead to further wage gains and
rising inflation this year.''
   Losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 3\ at 152;
International Business Machines, down } at 110{; Procter & Gamble,
down | at 74}; Ford Motor, down ~ at 47, and General Electric, down
{ at 39{.
   Genentech fell 2} to 30}. A company presentation prompted some
analysts to scale back their expectations for sales this year of a
Genentech drug used in treating heart-attack victims.
   Trans World Airlines climbed 1[ to 35{. Directors approved a
slightly increased offer from Carl Icahn, the company's chairman,
to take it private by acquiring the approximately 23 percent of the
stock still in public hands.
   Micron Technology rose 1} to 23\ on large volume in the
over-the-counter market. The stock has recently been recommended by
investment adviser Yale Hirsch and other analysts as a beneficiary
of heavy demand and rising prices for computer memory chips.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.37 billion, or 0.40
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 151.29 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.65 to 300.01, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.31 at 257.48.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dipped .09 to 379.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 301.81, down .58.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Surge In Response To Jobless Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged Friday in response to a
government report showing the national unemployment rate dropped in
April to its lowest level since June 1974.
   Silver futures also advanced while gold moved lower.
   On other markets, energy futures were higher; grains and
soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Among the precious metals, platinum futures showed the sharpest
reaction to April's 5.4 percent jobless rate. The platinum contract
for delivery in July jumped $5.40 to $526.60 a troy ounce on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But silver gained, too, and analysts said the net impact of the
unemployment report on the metals markets was positive.
   ``I'm not surprised there's a little jockeying going on, with
silver and platinum higher and gold a little lower. Maybe Monday
it'll be the reverse,'' said Richard Levine, vice president of
precious metals and foreign exchange trading with Elders Futures
Inc.
   The report's implications for a robust economy supported notions
that consumer prices are bound to rise, which could stir more
demand for precious metals, analysts said.
   Platinum prices got an extra boost because a growing economy
would mean greater industrial demand for the metal.
   ``Some parts of the report have to be viewed as having potential
for inflation,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``Work hours were up, hourly wage was up, overtime hours were
up,'' said Levine. ``We're talking about an economy that's really
moving along in terms of employment.''
   At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $1.70 to
$1.80 lower with June at $445.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents
to 2.2 cents higher with May at $6.381 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures climbed substantially higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in response to the International Energy
Agency's prediction of rising world demand.
   In its monthly report, the group predicted a 1.9 percent
increase in global oil demand this year compared to an increase of
1.45 percent last year, said Bob Baker, an analyst in New York with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 35 cents
higher with June at $17.74 cents a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent
to .85 cent higher with June at 47.42 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to .91 cent higher with June at 51.52 cents a
gallon.
   Soybean and wheat futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade
while corn finished marginally lower in a session dominated by
conflicting ideas about the weekend crop weather.
   ``Some weather guys have more rain in the forecast for the
weekend and early next week and others have less,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``The market was a little bit tentative, but it did seem to
favor those who tend to think there will be little less rain than a
little more,'' he said.
   The soybean market has been particularly sensitive to
indications of dry weather because recent government reports
indicate a poor crop could lead to a severe tightening of supplies.
   Soybean planting is barely under way, Lespinasse said, while the
corn crop is nearly half planted.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $2.97} a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.01} a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $1.61 a
bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 4\ cents higher with May at $6.92
a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as
the futures market continued an upward adjustment aimed at reducing
the steep discount of live cattle futures prices to cash cattle
prices, analysts said.
   Most hog prices settled slightly lower as the market took a
breather after four days of rising prices, said Tom Morgan,
president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``A lot of people are expecting a rally in the cash hogs and the
futures rallied earlier this week in anticipation of that,'' he
said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .55 cent higher with June at
72.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent
higher with May at 79.77 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with June unchanged at 51.65 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .23 cent to 1.07 cents lower with May at 52 cents
a pound.
   Stock-index futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
where the contract for June delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
index settled 1.20 points lower at 258.15.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower in Domestic Trading; Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly lower in domestic
trading Friday after rising overseas on the strength of a favorable
report on U.S. unemployment.
   Gold prices fell. In New York, Republic National Bank quoted
bullion at $443.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $445.25
on Thursday.
   The dollar finished mostly higher overseas and moved up sharply
in early domestic trading on the heels of a Labor Department report
that said the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent in
April, its lowest level since 1974.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a gain of 175,000
jobs in April. Growth in new factory jobs, which had been sluggish
the previous three months after rising dramatically in 1987,
accounted for more than one-fourth of the payroll increase.
   Leading the surge were export-related industries such as
machinery and fabricated metal products.
   ``The market interpreted it as slightly bullish for the
dollar,'' said Robert Ryan, senior trader at Irving Trust Co.
   But the dollar began to drift lower once the reaction to the
Labor Department data had run its course. The currency was met by
strong resistance when it tried to break out of the narrow range it
has held to for the past several weeks, and trading tapered off to
a trickle, dealers said.
   The dollar typically does not respond to employment data, but
dealers hoped Friday's announcement would provide some fresh
fundamentals on which to trade.
   ``People are looking for a catalyst to get us out of this
range,'' said James McGroarty, vice president at Discount Corp.
   The dollar closed at 124.88 Japanese yen in Tokyo, where markets
reopened after a three-day holiday, higher than 124.32 yen in
London late Thursday. The unemployment report was issued after the
close of trading in Tokyo.
   Later, in London, the dollar fell to 124.85 yen. In New York the
dollar closed at 124.77 yen, down from 124.905 yen on Wednesday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8730 from $1.8665 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8630 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.8620.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.67935 West German marks, down from
1.68405; 1.3995 Swiss francs, down from 1.4035; 5.7090 French
francs, down from 5.7275; 1,252.375 Italian lire, down from
1,258.00, and 1.23725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23365.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6805 West German marks, up from 1.6780; 1.4015
Swiss francs, up from 1.3955; 5.7230 French francs, up from 5.7052;
1.8860 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8790; 1,254.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,253.25; 1.2375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2333.
   Gold prices were buoyed by the U.S. unemployment data, but then
retreated amid profit-taking, dealers said. In London, the metal
fell to a late bid price of $442.10 a troy ounce, down from $445.25
bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it fell to $443 bid from $445.50 bid
late Thursday.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $443.70 a troy
ounce, down from $445.40 on Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose to a closing bid of $448.71 from
$447.07 bid at Thursday's close.
   Silver finished higher at $6.381 a troy ounce on New York's
Comex, up from $6.327 on Thursday. In London the metal fell to a
late bid price of $6.36 a troy ounce from $6.37 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Savings Bond Sales Dip in April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of U.S. savings bonds dropped for the
first time in eight months in April, falling 6.4 percent to $661
million, the government said Friday.
   The Treasury Department said April sales were $45 million lower
than in March, when sales were $706 million, and an identical
amount lower than sales a year ago.
   Still, with the inclusion of interest earnings, the value of
outstanding bonds rose by $1.07 billion to total $105.09 billion in
April, 10 percent higher than a year ago. Sales had increased for
seven consecutive months, from September through March.
   Since November 1982, savings bonds held five years or longer
earn market-based interest rates. The current rate, in effect until
Nov. 1, is 6.90 percent, down from 7.17 percent in the six months
ending May 1.
   The Treasury Department is hoping a new program, which began
Tuesday, will boost bond sales. Investors now can use a credit card
to buy bonds by calling a toll-free number, 1-800-US-BONDS, 24
hours a day.

   USG Corp. said Friday it has proposed a
settlement to lawsuits filed by shareholders who objected to parts
of the company's plan to recapitalize in the face of a hostile
takeover bid.
   An unspecified number of suits were filed in Delaware Chancery
Court sometime after Monday, when USG unveiled details of its $2.2
billion recapitalization plan. The Chicago-based building products
company is incorporated in Delaware.
   The proposed settlement, which still must be approved by the
court, would add $92.4 million to the cost of the recapitalization.
   The investor group pursuing a $2 billion takeover bid, Desert
Partners LP of Midland, Texas, said in a statement it did not
believe the settlement would be approved.
   Shareholders objected to aspects of the recapitalization plan
that would dilute the value of their shares, USG spokeswoman Randi
Killian said.
   Under its initial plan, USG proposed to pay shareholders $37 in
cash, debentures with a face value of $5 and a share of stock in
the recapitalized corporation for each common share.
   But each of the 2.2 million shares held by the company's
employee investment plans instead were to be swapped for eight
shares in the new company. USG would have had to issue 17.9 million
new shares to the investment plans, which irked some shareholders
over dilution of their holdings.
   As part of its proposed settlement, USG agreed the shares held
by the employee plans would receive the same payout of cash, notes
and stock as other sharesholders, rather than just straight stock.
   The settlement proposal would keep the number of outstanding
shares at 54 million, down from the 70 million called for under the
original plan.
   ``It is now costing USG more, but the shares are worth more''
because there are fewer outstanding, Killian said.
   Desert Partners called the proposed settlement a ``thinly
disguised public relations gesture to bolster (USG's) position in
the upcoming proxy contest.'' The two sides are building up to a
showdown at USG's annual meeting on May 11. Desert Partners has
nominated a slate of six candidates to USG's 15-member board.
   The partnership noted in a statement that USG is not obligated
to go through with the terms of the settlement if it is not
approved by the court.
   Desert Partners, a partnership headed by two Texas oilmen, has
been trying to acquire USG for months. The partnership has a
$42-a-share tender offer outstanding that values USG at $2.16
billion, but has made repeated efforts to negotiate a merger at a
higher price.
   Earlier this week Desert Partners offered to acquire USG in a
deal Wall Street sources estimated would be worth $50 a share, or
about $2.58 billion.
   Desert Partners, headed by Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown,
owns about 9.9 percent of USG's shares and said that as of last
Friday about 19.3 million shares, or 37.5 percent, had been
tendered under its $42-a-share offer.
   USG is the holding company for United States Gypsum Co., USG
Interiors Inc., Masonite Corp. and several other operating
subsidiaries.

   A class action suit was filed Friday
on behalf of Texaco Inc. shareholders who claim takeover strategist
Carl Icahn manipulated the price of the oil giant's shares so he
could buy them cheaply.
   The suit is a companion to one filed by Texaco earlier this week
alleging massive securities law violations by Icahn, who is
Texaco's largest shareholder and chairman of Trans World Airlines
Inc.
   Stanley Bernstein, an attorney who helped file the shareholder
suit, said he expected the case to be joined with the main Texaco
action at U.S. District Court in White Plains. Texaco is
headquartered in nearby Harrison, N.Y.
   The shareholder suit claims that Icahn, along with associates
and companies he controls, deceived, manipulated and harmed other
Texaco shareholders to advance his own interests since buying a big
block of Texaco stock last fall.
   Icahn was out of his office and unavailable for comment on the
suit.
   He began buying the stock while Texaco was negotiating a
settlement with rival Pennzoil over a $10.3 billion judgment
awarded Pennzoil after a Texas jury found Texaco had illegally
interfered with Pennzoil's merger with Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy code last year and emerged last month under a
court-approved reorganization plan.
   The shareholder suit charges Icahn interfered with the
reorganization process, traded on inside information, circulated
false and misleading information and otherwise engaged in acts
which constituted a ``manipulative or deceptive device'' prohibited
by the federal securities laws.
   Such actions allowed Icahn to purchase an estimated 30 million
shares of Texaco between October 1987 and May 1988 below market
value, the suit said.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of all those Texaco
shareholders who sold stock during the period Oct. 2, 1987 and May
3, 1988.
   The suit was filed in Manhattan but was expected to be
transfered to White Plains.
   Texaco's suit, filed Tuesday, seeks to invalidate Icahn attempt
to install himself and some associates on the company's board of
directors.

<HEAD>Texas Air Posts $124.3 Million Loss for First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. on Friday reported a net loss of
$124.3 million for the first quarter, which the airline giant
blamed largely on labor troubles at Eastern Airlines and bad winter
weather affecting Continental Airlines.
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline holding company with
about 20 percent of the market, is the parent of Eastern and
Continental. Its overall loss of $124.3 million widened from a
$100.7 million loss in the first three months of 1987.
   The latest loss occurred despite an increase in revenue, to
$2.13 billion from $2.04 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   Texas Air attributed the losses at Miami-based Eastern to a
``crippling'' campaign being waged by the Eastern pilots and
machinists unions against the carrier.
   Eastern and Texas Air sued the two unions Friday for $1.5
billion, accusing them of ``Eastern bashing'' to drive down the
airline's value so they could buy it cheaply.
   Eastern posted a net loss of $31 million for the first quarter,
compared with net income of $2.1 million a year earlier. Revenue
declined to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion.
   The company said Houston-based Continental's losses were caused
by bad weather and the costs of integrating the airline into the
parent, which had also been problems in late 1987.
   Continental recorded a first-quarter loss of $80.6 million on
revenue of $1.1 billion, narrowed from a loss of $97.9 million on
revenue of $900 million.
   Continental's earnings for first-quarter 1987 were restated to
include the results for People Express, New York Air and Rocky
Mountain Airways, which Continental purchased from Texas Air in
April 1987.
   ``The losses reported by both (Eastern and Continental) are
close to our expectations and reflect the unusual operating
environments which each airline faces at this time,'' Texas Air
spokesman Bruce Hicks said.
   He said Continental experienced a difficult first quarter but
ended the period ``on a positive and profitable note.''
   Improving fare levels, operating performances and generally
positive traffic trends are producing a marked change in
Continental's financial performance, Hicks said.
   At Eastern, ``aggressive'' cost control and the elimination of
non-economic services helped reduce the first-quarter loss from the
level of losses incurred in the second half of 1987, Texas Air said.
   Texas Air officials have blamed the pilots and machinists unions
at Eastern for the current investigations of both big Texas Air
carriers by the Department of Transportation and the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The investigations have turned up no major safety flaws in the
planes.
   Hicks said the past several weeks have been ``most difficult and
challenging'' because of the investigations.
   ``We strongly believe that Texas Air and its airlines will
emerge from this process with renewed confirmation of our
objectives,'' he said.

   Interest rates headed higher and bonds declined
in value Friday after the government reported that the nation's
jobless rate slipped to its lowest level in 14 years during April.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue, which on Thursday
gained about \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, ended down
$6.25. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose to 9.15
percent from 9.09 percent.
   Bond prices started out on a positive note but fell sharply
shortly after the Labor Department reported that last month's
unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent, the lowest since June 1974.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a gain of 175,000
jobs, more than one-fourth of them on factory assembly lines in
industries that have increased their exports in recent months.
   Analysts said the employment figures suggested the economy was
strengthening and that might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten
its credit policies to rein in growth. A tighter policy means
interest rates will rise, thereby lowering the value of existing
bonds
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were [ point to \ point lower, intermediate maturities
fell between \ point and { point and long-term issues were down
about | point, according to Telerate Inc., a business information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.34 to 109.65. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, slipped

   The federal government on Friday charged
E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc. in connection with an alleged
money-laundering scheme that helped organized crime figures and
businessmen conceal at least $532,000 from the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Hutton was expected to plead guilty to the three felony counts
of conspiracy and money laundering, U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond
said.
   Two former Hutton brokers were also named in documents, known as
a criminal information, filed in U.S. District Court here. One of
the brokers, Stephen S. Fusco, died shortly after the investigation
began, and Almond said charges against the other, Brian J. Lareau,
46, of Jamestown, would be filed next week.
   The charges accuse Hutton of failing to report at least $532,000
in currency transactions through its Providence office. Federal law
requires that cash transactions of greater than $10,000 must be
reported to the IRS.
   The people for whom the transaction were allegedly made were not
named. In the past, Almond has said up to $1.2 million was
involved, some of it from organized-crime figures and some from
businessmen.
   Hutton was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
and the company is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. A
Shearson spokesman, Michael O' Neill, said the company would
acquiesce to the charges.
   ``There was an agreement reached about a month and a half ago at
which Hutton agreed to a criminal disposition,'' O'Neill said. The
filing of the charges, he said, was ``the next logical step.''
   O'Neill said the charges would not interfere with Hutton's
current operations. ``It's an old matter and the principals have
long since left the firm,'' he said.
   Hutton faces up to $1.01 million in fines.
   Almond called the alleged scheme ``a major problem existing in
the Providence office of Hutton.'' He said he did not know of any
wrongdoing at other Hutton offices.
   He declined to give details of the alleged crimes on Friday but
said they would be spelled out after a court hearing on May 16.
   According to the criminal information, Fusco allegedly accepted
cash in amounts greater than $10,000 from clients and directed
other Hutton employees to take the cash to Providence banks and buy
cashier's checks in denominations smaller than $10,000.
   The cashier's checks would then be deposited in the customers'
accounts and used to purchase bearer bonds, which would be redeemed
through intermediaries to conceal their true ownership, the
information charged.
   Almond said the investigation of Hutton began in the summer of
1985. After the probe was completed last summer, the Justice
Department and the company began several months of negotiations
which led to the charges being filed.
   Fusco, who died of cancer in late 1985, committed ``the more
egregious offenses,'' Almond said. ``Lareau was an offshoot of
that.''
   No other individuals will be charged in the case, Almond said. A
corporation can be held criminally liable for the acts of its
employees, but there was no evidence other Hutton employees
participated in the alleged crimes, he said.
   Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, a felony
conviction could result in the total suspension of investment
services.
   Shearson said last month it expected to receive waivers from the
SEC that would allow it to continue business.
   Last October, the SEC found that Hutton had violated provisions
of the SEC law and rules relating to financial record keeping and
reporting of currency transactions.
   As a result, Hutton was censured and directed to report to the
SEC on policies and procedures regarding the receipt of cash
deposits and to adopt surveillance procedures to monitor deposits
of multiple bank checks.

<HEAD>Proxy Count Review Confirms Gillette Victory</HEAD>

   A recount of shareholder ballots confirmed that
Coniston Group's attempt to oust four Gillette Co. directors
failed, the toiletry maker said Friday.
   Gillette spokeswoman Joan Fitzgerald said the review of
Tuesday's proxy ballot results by Corporation Trust Co. settled
Coniston's challenge of the count.
   Coniston, a New York-based investor group, has been maneuvering
to take over Gillette, a major maker of men's toiletries that has
battled other takeover attempts in the past.
   Coniston principal Paul E. Tierney Jr. downplayed the
significance of the recount and said an upcoming trial in U.S.
District Court will determine if there were any irregularities in
obtaining the votes.
   ``What it shows is that Corporation Trust ... did in fact add
them up correctly,'' said Tierney. ``It did not show that those
votes were legally obtained or properly obtained.''
   A final report and certification of the ballot count is expected
next week. The trial stemming from challenges filed by both
Gillette and Coniston during the proxy fight is scheduled to begin
June 13.
   On Tuesday, a preliminary count of about 87 million shares
voting in the proxy election showed 48 percent support for
Coniston's four director candidates, who pledged to try to convince
the other eight directors to sell Gillette's personal care empire.
They needed a simple majority to be elected.
   The proxy ballots were submitted during Gillette's April 21
annual meeting in Andover following a three-month battle
highlighted by full-page newspaper advertisements and several
mailings to shareholders.
   New York-based Coniston, which controls 6.76 million shares,
about 5.8 percent of Gillette's 115.5 million shares outstanding,
immediately challenged the results of the preliminary count.
   Gillette fell 75 cents a share Friday to $38.62{ in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
   Besides Tierney, the Coniston candidates were Coniston
principals Augustus K. Oliver and Keith R. Gollust and former cable
executive David Strassler.
   The Gillette directors up for re-election to three-year terms
were Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman M. Mockler Jr.,
Lawrence E. Fouraker, Herbert H. Jacobi and Joseph F. Turley.
   In 1986, Gillette halted several takeover attempts by Revlon
Group Inc. by signing a 10-year no-takeover pact and buying back
Revlon's stock for nearly $580 million.

<HEAD>Chrysler-UAW Settlement Approved By Chrysler Council</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with tentative contract approved by Chrysler
council.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

   A tentative early contract settlement
between the United Auto Workers union and Chrysler Corp. was
approved Friday by the UAW's 140-member national Chrysler council.
   The job-protecting pact will be presented to rank-and-file
members next week for ratification.
   The two-year contract covers 66,000 hourly and salaried workers
and 65,000 retirees at the No. 3 automaker. If ratified by workers,
it will replace a three-year pact that would have expired Sept. 14.
   The Chrysler council approved the pact after a 5{-hour meeting.
One of the subjects of debate was a provision that would have given
full Chrysler seniority to former American Motors Corp. workers in
1990. The settlement was approved after that provision was taken
out.
   ``It should pass. The job security is there, that was the most
important issue,'' said Mike Allen, a union official with UAW Local
624 in Syracuse, N.Y.
   ``It is a good contract and will provide reasonable gains until
1990,'' said Thomas Russell, president of Local 1413 in Huntsville,
Ala.
   But Russell, whose plant belongs to the Acustar Inc. parts
subsidiary that Chrysler tried unsuccessfully to sell earlier this
year, added that his temperament was altered somewhat because,
``I'm still stinging from the proposed sale of Acustar'' and had
hoped the contract would keep Chrysler from being able to sell the
operation.
   Unlike the Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. agreements it
was patterned on, the Chrysler pact also includes a $1,000 signing
bonus, guarantees workers will receive a minimum of $500 in
profit-sharing for 1988 regardless of the company's performance and
prevents Chrysler from paying executives cash or stock bonuses in
years when a profit-sharing formula generates no payout for workers.
   In addition, it will cover 1,200 former AMC workers in Wisconsin
beginning 90 days after a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha,
Wis., closes at year's end. Workers at a 1,000-worker engine plant
in Kenosha and a 200-worker parts depot in Milwaukee, whose
operations will remain open, will then be folded into the UAW's
Chrysler family.
   In order to finish negotiations, Chrysler and the UAW first
settled the issue of millions of dollars that AMC owed 9,000
active, laid-off and retired Wisconsin workers when Chrysler bought
the ailing automaker in August.
   Under that settlement, the workers will receive an average of
$6,000 to $8,000 each or $57 million _ 100 percent of the money
they loaned AMC in concessions in 1982 but none of $8 million in
interest AMC had promised.
   Some delegates at Friday's meeting said they weren't satisfied
with the $1,000 signing bonus, in part because of the size of the
payments to AMC workers.
   But most indicated they expected the industry-pattern pact to be
ratified.
   A particular high point was a provision that appears to prevent
the layoff of workers at four of Chrysler's Acustar Inc. parts
plants to be closed or sold by September 1989. The four plants _
three in the Detroit area and one in Van Wert, Ohio _ employ about
2,000 workers.
   Under the contract, Chrysler will continue paying the salaries
of workers who otherwise would be laid-off if the plants or closed
or sold. Instead of being laid off, those workers would be placed
in a job bank and allowed to move to other plants when openings
occur.
   If any of the plants are sold, their workers also can choose
whether they will stay with Chrysler or go with the purchaser.
   ``I can live with that. That's what we attempted to negotiate,''
said Don Lingar, president of Local 372. Lingar's 105-worker
Acustar chemical plant in Trenton is certain to be closed because
of serious health-and-safety problems.
   The contract returns Chrysler to the industry pattern for the
first time since 1979, when the UAW granted Chrysler deep
concessions to help it win federal loan guarantees that rescued the
automaker from the verge of bankruptcy. In 1990, all Big Three
contracts will expire together, giving the UAW a choice of any of
the three at which to set the pattern for the others.
   The pattern contract prevents further plant closings and layoffs
for any reason other than production cuts caused by slow sales,
halves the attrition rate, restricts companies' ability to transfer
work to outside suppliers or foreign countries, pays lump sum
bonuses equal to 3 percent of wages each year and provides
profit-sharing based on a company's U.S. performance.
