   A drifter who supported himself
and his flair for New Wave clothing by gambling goes on trial
Monday on charges he sexually assaulting two aspiring teen-age
models and murdered their chaperones.
   Herbert James Coddington, 29, is accused of luring Reno, Nev.,
modeling school owner Maybelle ``Mabs'' Martin, 69, her friend
Dorothy ``Dottie'' Walsh, 67, and the teen-agers to his South Lake
Tahoe mobile home last May with the ruse of making an anti-drug
videotape.
   The women were strangled and their bodies stuffed in green
plastic trash bags. The girls, then aged 12 and 14, were imprisoned
in a sound-deadened room in the trailer where they remained for two
days until FBI agents stormed in, freed the girls and recovered the
victims' bodies.
   Defense lawyers have indicated Coddington, who faces death in
the gas chamber if convicted, will plead insanity.
   ``We don't say he didn't do it,'' said attorney Steve Tapson.
   Jury selection will begin Monday in Superior Court in
Placerville, Calif., where the case was moved because of extensive
news coverage following his arrest here on May 18, 1987.
   Last July, Coddington was charged with another murder. He was
accused of killing Sheila Keister, 12, whose battered body was
found in the desert in August 1981, just outside Las Vegas, Nev.,
where she was abducted while playing.
   In high school, Coddington was known as ``Herb,'' a quiet loner
who didn't date and was said to be a math whiz, possibly explaining
his gambling abilities.
   Prosecutor Ron Tepper said the defendant's successes at the
poker, blackjack and baccarat tables ``show we're not dealing with
somebody who is intellectually impoverished. We're dealing with
somebody who has some gift.''
   Although he had been unemployed for some time before his arrest,
Coddington drove a new BMW, on loan from a South Lake Tahoe car
dealership, which became the key link that led to his arrest and
the rescue of the girls.
   Coddington had made the rounds of Reno-area modeling agencies in
the week before the girls and their chaperones disappeared, looking
for blonde, all-American girls for the purported videotaping
session.
   While most of the agency representatives remembered only a
dirty-looking man with grimy hair who smelled bad, one recalled the
BMW and its dealer's license plate.
   Neither side in the case has discussed any motive, and Tapson
said his client is ``violently anti-drug and opposed to drinking,
smoking and coffee.''

   Former Rep. Gladys Noon Spellman died early
Sunday in a suburban Maryland nursing home at age 70. She had been
in a coma for nearly eight years.
   Mrs. Spellman, a Democrat who represented Maryland in Congress,
was headed for re-election to her fourth term in the House when her
heart stopped beating temporarily on Oct. 31, 1980, while she was
judging a Halloween costume contest at a shopping mall.
   Four days later, she was re-elected to Congress with 80 percent
of the vote over little-known Republican Kevin R. Igoe.
   Mrs. Spellman remained hospitalized in critical condition for
several weeks following her heart attack, but her condition later
stabilized and she was able to breath without the aid of
life-support equipment.
   She never regained consciousness.
   After receiving a medical analysis stating that Mrs. Spellman
was in a ``trance-like state'' and unable to take the oath of
office, the House declared her seat vacant in February 1981.
   It was the first time the House vacated the seat of a member who
had become mentally or physically disabled.
   Thirty-two Republican and Democratic candidates, including Mrs.
Spellman's husband, Reuben, entered a special primary on April 7,
1981, to select the nominees to run for election in Maryland's
Fifth District.
   Spellman was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Steny
Hoyer, who went on to defeat Audrey Scott, the GOP mayor of Bowie,
Md., in a special election held May 19, 1981. Hoyer continues to
serve in the House.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., recalled Sunday that Mrs. Spellman
was assigned as a ``big sister'' to help acquaint her with the
workings of Congress when she arrived in 1977.
   ``After an hour and a half, I felt like an old hand after being
in Gladys Spellman's hands,'' Ms. Mikulski said.
   ``I thought Gladys Spellman was great,'' she continued. ``She
knew how to respond to the day-to-day needs of her constituents.
She was probably one of the best Maryland public servants in terms
of constituent services.''
   Ruth Davis, a longtime friend who was Mrs. Spellman's office
manager, said Mrs. Spellman died at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday. She died
at the Hebrew Home of Greater Washington in Rockville, Md.
   Born in New York City on March 2, 1918, as Gladys Noon, Mrs.
Spellman was educated in Washington D.C. public schools, and
attended George Washington University and the Graduate School of
the Department of Agriculture.
   Her first elected position was as a member of the Prince
George's County Board of Commissioners in 1962. In 1967, she was
appointed by President Johnson to the Advisory Commission on
Intergovernmental Relations.
   She was first elected to Congress in November 1974.
   She is survived by her husband and three children, Stephen
Louis, Richard Eric and Dana Spellman O'Neill, in addition to four
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Abbie Hoffman Smoking Mad At Continental Airlines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activist Abbie Hoffman said Sunday he was ordered
off a Continental Airlines plane at O'Hare International Airport
after a flight attendant unjustly accused him of smoking marijuana
in the lavatory.
   Hoffman, the 51-year-old former Yippie leader, said ``some very
strange things'' seem to happen to him in Chicago, where 20 years
ago he was a key organizer of the August 1968 anti-Vietnam War
protests at the Democratic National Convention.
   The incident occurred late Friday afternoon just after he had
boarded a flight bound for Newark, N.J., after visiting Chicago to
meet with Playboy magazine editors, Hoffman said by telephone from
Northampton, Mass., where he was speaking at an anti-nuclear power
rally.
   Minutes before takeoff, Hoffman said, he went into the lavatory
to take some prescription medicine. Suddenly, the fire alarm bells
started ringing.
   ``Then the stewardess pushes in the door with her knee like a
stormtrooper, and starts shouting, `You've been smoking
marijuana,''' Hoffman said. ``I said, `Like hell, bring on the
dogs. I'm not smoking anything.'''
   ``She's lucky I didn't have my pants down.''
   Hoffman said he was ordered off the plane, and as he was getting
off some passengers asked for his autograph.
   He said he was briefly questioned by an official who didn't
identify himself, and then allowed to board Continental's next
flight to Newark. But the airline lost his carry-on bag, he said.
   Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman, said it was company policy
not to release passenger names, but confirmed that a male passenger
was ordered off the Newark-bound flight.
   He said several crew members and passengers ``smelled a burning
odor coming from the lavatory'' after the smoke alarms went off
while the plane was refueling.
   ``Smoking on the ground or in a lavatory is in violation of
federal aviation regulations and could conceivably put the safety
of passengers and crew members at risk,'' said Walker, reached at
his home in Houston.
   ``The passenger admitted to our personnel that he was in the
lavatory smoking a Cuban cigarette,'' said Walker, adding that he
did not know the cigarette's contents.
   The man then ``apologized and assured our personnel that he
would conduct himself in accordance with the law,'' Walker said.
   In his Northampton appearance, Hoffman criticized actress Jane
Fonda's recent apology for her 1972 trip to North Vietnam and
called her ``a fink.''
   Fonda last week expressed regret for her trip to Hanoi, which
has embittered many veterans and conservatives for years.
   ``The times were extreme and maybe what we did was extreme but
you need the generals to apologize for what they did,'' Hoffman
told a crowd of about 300.

   Dexterity in the operating room translates
into sleight of hand on stage for an orthopedic surgeon who spends
some of his nights performing at a Hollywood magic club.
   Dr. Jeff Berman, chief of orthopedics and director of sports
medicine at Century City Hospital, has appeared occasionaly at the
Magic Castle for the past five years.
   Berman, 36, makes coins disappear, reassembles a rope cut into
pieces and does seemingly impossible things with playing cards.
   ``I think being an orthopedic surgeon has made it easier for me
to learn magic,'' said Berman, 36. ``I'm used to performing
intricate operations with my hands.''
   He began taking magic lessons from a professional magician
friend after completing his medical education and residency.
   ``Both activities require exquisite attention to detail,''
Berman said in a recent interview.
   He practices his tricks at home, first by himself, then with his
wife, Nancy, and baby daughter, Samantha, as the audience.
   Berman appears at least once a month at the club as an unpaid
performer, but his hospital job doesn't allow him to keep a regular
schedule.
   ``It's not the kind of thing I could do carrying a beeper,'' he
said.

   The Rt. Rev. Frederick Houk Borsch was
ordained as the fifth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los
Angeles in ceremonies that combined ancient rites with modern
ethnic concerns.
   About 3,000 members of Southern California's diverse
Episcopalian community attended Saturday's ordination at the Sports
Arena, including more than 20 Episcopalian bishops from around the
world and clergy from other faiths.
   In a ritual dating to the Christian church's earliest days,
Borsch, 52, knelt before the denomination's leader, Presiding
Bishop Edmond Lee Browning, as visiting bishops laid hands on him
and prayed, said Dan Crossland, a video consultant with the diocese.
   The ethnic and cultural differences of the diocese's 151
congregations were emphasized by the presence of a mariachi band
along with a traditional choir.
   Borsch was presented with the bishop's robes and staff of
office, and received his miter from Janice Rusack, the widow of his
predecessor, Robert C. Rusack, who died in July 1986, Crossland
said.
   He received symbolic presentations including bread, water and
oil.
   Borsch, who was elected bishop at a diocesan convention on Jan.
8, will head a diocese comprised of 80,000 people scattered
throughout Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange and San
Bernardino counties and half of Riverside County.
   Borsch was dean of the chapel at Princeton University, a post he
held since 1981. Before that, he was dean of the Church Divinity
School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., and taught at various
seminaries and colleges.
   He is married and the father of three grown sons.

   Five Palestinians went on trial Sunday on
charges they killed five Britons and two Sudanese in terrorist
attacks last month at a hotel and a club frequented by foreigners.
   The defendants, who face the death penalty if convicted, refused
defense lawyers and claimed Judge Ahmed Bashir already made up his
mind they were guilty.
   They told the court they were ``strugglers for the sake of the
Palestinian cause.''
   Judge Bashir calmly replied his verdict will be based only on
evidence before the court. He consented to a prosecution request
for the court to appoint a lawyer and adjourned the closed-door
trial until next Sunday.
   The Palestinians are charged with premeditated murder,
participation in murder and possession of illegal arms in
connection with bombing and shooting incidents May 15.
   The attacks occurred at the Acropol Hotel, which caters mostly
to foreigners, and the Sudan Club, which is reserved for British
and Commonwealth nationals.
   The seven victims included a four-member British family.
Twenty-one others, mostly foreigners, were also wounded in the
attacks.
   The defendants, arrested shortly after the attacks, had Lebanese
passports and claimed to be affiliated with the terrorist Abu Nidal
group. Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabry Banna, heads a faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization that opposes PLO leader
Yasser Arafat.
   Security sources said the defendants told questioners they were
sent to avenge the assassination of Khalil Wazir or Abu Jihad, the
second-ranking man in the PLO who was killed April 16 in Tunis,
allegedly by an Israeli team.
   The defendants are Mustafa Gasim Rufai, 26, Imad Ahmed Huwilo,
23, Hassan Gasim, 25, Sharif Izzat Atawi, 22 and Ibrahim Fusaei, 30.

   The investigation of alleged bribery and fraud
in Pentagon weapons-buying shows the ``good old boy network'' in
the Reagan administration was more worried about winning huge
defense budgets than about making sure the government spent its
money wisely, four key legislators said Sunday.
   Meantime, President Reagan, attending a summit meeting of the
leaders of western democracies in Toronto, refused to comment on
news reports that former Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. may have
warned his long-time ally, military consultant Melvyn Paisley, that
Paisley was under investigation.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the Pentagon has had ``a serious management problem
... for a number of years.''
   ``I also knew that we did not have the kind of people in the
Pentagon at high levels that really had background in management,''
said Nunn. ``We had people being selected for their ideological
beliefs, for their salesmanship, but not for good sound management.
   ``I think the emphasis has been on salesmanship and getting the
money and the management end of it has been the last of the list of
priorities,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of House Armed Services
Committee, said on the ABC show he agreed and added, ``I do think
that, in one sense, it's surprising this hasn't happened before.
You know, it's always been advantageous to have (inside)
information. There's always always been a lot of money floating
around.''
   They were referring to the two-year-long investigation into
allegations that defense contractors paid consultants and
government officials for secret Pentagon information that was
useful in winning weapons contracts worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. The investigation, under way for two years, came to light
last Tuesday when FBI and Naval Investigative Service raided the
offices of Pentagon officials, defense contractors and consultants.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson has said that perhaps as many as 200
indictments could be expected out of the investigation, a
government source said Sunday.
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a sharp critic of Pentagon waste,
said the affair arises from ``the good old boy network, it's an
ethic within the Defense Department that breeds an attitude among
the defense industry, `catch us if you can.'''
   Grassley was interviewed on CBS-TV's ``Face The Nation,'' along
with Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Dingell's panel has investigated Pentagon waste
as has the Senate Judiciary administrative practices subcommitte,
which Grassley has chaired.
   Both said their committees turned up evidence of Pentagon waste,
but nothing was done.
   ``We've been aware of this stuff for a long time, except nothing
was done about it,'' said Grassley. ``Its both an institutional
problem, but it's also a case of personal greed. It's part of the
culture of the military-industrial complex and we have been trying
to send this message for five years to prosecutors, to the Justice
Department, to get interested in this sort of thing.''
   Grassley said investigators have contacted his subcommittee
staff members to discuss information which casme to light in a
series of 1985 hearings which he said focused on similar
allegations.
   In answer to questions, Grassley said, ``I'm not suggesting
there's a cover-up'' by top Pentagon or Justice Department
officials.
   Dingell complained that administration officials didn't want to
act. ``Nothing discernable was done,'' he explained.
   ``We have found consistant instances where the buddy-buddy
approach would prevent vigorous actions by the Defense Department
into these kinds of abuses.''
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who resigned after
seven years in November, defended the administration's efforts to
prevent procurement fraud but said he would support changes in the
military contracting process if reports of extensive wrongdoing
proved true.
   ``If there are some procedures that permitted this to happen and
it's more than just simple greed and dishonesty, then obviously the
procedures need tightening,'' Weinberger said in a telephone
interview with The New York Times published in Monday's editions.
   Federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the possibility
that Lehman tipped Paisley off that he might be the subject of an
investigation. It was disclosed last week that Paisley's home and
office were wiretapped in the investigation. He has emerged as a
key figure in the probe.
   Paisley was a former top Navy official under Lehman before
resigning in April, 1987 and opening a consulting business. Paisley
has emerged as a key figure in the investigation.
   ``I am not going to comment until we have all the information,''
Reagan said in response to a question shouted at him during his
arrival in Toronto.
   Aspin noted that when Lehman headed the Navy, he centralized
power.
   ``The thing about the Lehman Navy is that the decisions in the
Lehman Navy were really highly centralized in a few people right
around the secretary, John Lehman, and he had a very strong view
about people who were with him and people who were against him. And
some of the people who were with him may be a little shady
characters.''
   ``But if you were with John Lehman, on his side in all of the
fights, boy, you were on the inside,'' said Aspin. ``And if you
were against him, even though you were honest and capable, you were
really kind of stiff-armed in the whole process.''

   It works like an intricate telephone cable, with millions of
microwires carrying messages to and from body organs and
extremities. But if these ``wires'' fray or snap, they can't be
spliced, glued or soldered.
   Injury prevents brain messages of balance and movement to reach
the limbs. Messages of pain, touch and temperature can't reach the
brain.
   ``You sit there and rot and wait to die,'' Sandy Valentino, 24,
paralyzed seven years ago in a car accident, said of her initial
devastation. ``When you don't die, you pick up the pieces and
decide what you're going to do with the rest of your life. Despair
makes you search for something, anything, to try.''
   Miss Valentino is now working to build her arm muscles in the
biofeedback unit at the Miami Project.
   When the spinal cord is injured, bleeding and swelling kill off
the nerve fibers, and the eventual scars block messages to and from
the brain. Any cure must come from regenerating the nerves to grow
through or around the scar.
   The problem is that spinal nerves are biologically programmed to
grow only in the fetal stage. Peripheral nerves, however, such as
those found in arms and legs, can grow back, and researchers are
trying to transplant them inside the spinal cord.
   In 1982, Dr. Albert Aguayo of Montreal's McGill University
Medical School grafted cells from a rat's leg nerve into its
damaged spinal cord. The nerve grew but stopped at the other side
of the scar without making a functioning connection.
   At the Miami Project, one promising research effort toward nerve
regeneration is being moved to Sweden because of intense feeling on
abortion here.
   The particular research implants cells from aborted human
fetuses into rats to see if new spinal cord nerves will sprout. Dr.
Ake Seiger, director of basic research at the Miami Project, also
worked on the Swedish research teams that used fetal cells to
regenerate brain cells in victims of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
diseases.
   Anti-abortion groups in the United States oppose using fetal
cells, and the National Institutes of Health in April barred
federal researchers from transplanting fetal brain tissue into
Parkinson's patients.
   Arthur Caplan, head of the Center for Biomedical Research at the
University of Minnesota, backs the use of fetal cells despite the
abortion debate.
   ``If it works, it would revolutionize medicine. It would offer
cures and help to people who had nothing. It will be almost
irresistible to use, no matter what the ethical questions are,''
Caplan said.
   In other spinal cord research:
   _ Neuroscientist Paul Reier at the University of Florida in
Gainesville is working with rat fetal cells to build a bridge
around or through a spinal cord injury;
   _ Scientists using fetal cells on a thin splint got a damaged
peripheral nerve that controls the toe of a rat to grow back into
the spinal cord, where it made connections to restore function. The
work was done by neurologists Jerry Silver of Case-Western Reserve
University and Michael Kliot of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
   _ At Purdue University, biophysicist Richard Borgens has
implanted tiny batteries above spinal cord injuries, creating
low-level electrical pulses that encourage nerves to grow through
scar tissue. Of 200 paralyzed guinea pigs implanted, 25 percent
showed some movement, Borgens said.
   When he played for the Dolphins, Nick Buoniconti was the heart
of a unit of overachievers known as the No-Name Defense that helped
Miami win two Super Bowls and go unbeaten in the 1972 season.
   After his son's injury, he helped coordinate existing research
and assembled a team of doctors to try to beat paralysis.
   In 2{ years, the Miami Project has raised $8 million and has
spent $6 million on research. It hopes to raise $20 million for a
self-sustaining endowment.
   ``We've replaced the word despair with hope. We've given science
an opportunity,'' said the elder Buoniconti.
   His son just completed his first full semester at the University
of Miami, where he made the dean's list as a psychology major.
   ``There's a great possibility I'll live and die in this
wheelchair,'' Buoniconti said. ``But there's no reason to feel
sorry for myself. I've been taught that in all adversity, never
give up. I wouldn't know how to give up.''

   The state's first gay pride march was held
Sunday in Oklahoma City without any incidents, despite rumors that
the Ku Klux Klan might attempt to disrupt the event.
   ``Here in Oklahoma, because it is the buckle of the Bible Belt,
the gay rights movement has been very slow,'' said parade chairman
Andy Southam. ``We're hoping that with this first march people's
thinking will start to move forward.''
   Parade organizers said nearly 400 lesbians and gay men came from
Oklahoma and nearby states participated, as did Jeff Levi,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, who
flew back from an AIDS conference in Stockholm, Sweden.
   ``This first march is a coming of age for the local community,''
Levi said. ``It's important in coalescing a feeling of community
and a feeling of pride. Particulary during the AIDS crisis, it is
important to be doing positive things when so many people are sick
and dying.''
   A group of people with AIDS were honorary grand marshals for the
parade. Other participants carried balloons that Southam said
represented people who could not attend because of social pressures.

   Oscar H. Davis, a judge for the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the federal circuit, died Sunday at the age of
74.
   Davis died of cancer at George Washington University Hospital.
   He was named to the U.S. Court of Claims in 1962, and was chief
judge during the 1970s.
   Davis was named to the appeals bench six years ago, following a
federal court reorganization that abolished the Court of Claims and
set up a new federal circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   He was a native of New York City and served with the Army Air
Forces during World War II. A Harvard University graduate in 1934,
Davis was a 1937 graduate of Columbia University Law School.
   He joined the Justice Department's claims division in 1939 after
practicing law in New York City for two years. Davis joined the
solicitor general's office in 1949, and was named first assistant

   Davis argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court
during his tenure in the solicitor general's office, and

<TEXT>
   Norris Paxton, who headed The Associated
Press bureau in Albany, N.Y., for nearly three decades, has died of
cancer. He was 87.
   Paxton, who moved to Madison 16 years ago, died Saturday at a
nursing home here where he had spent his last five days.
   He was one of the wire service's youngest bureau chiefs when he
took charge of its Albany bureau in 1936. When he retired on March
31, 1966, Paxton was the AP's senior bureau administrator in years
of service.
   ``He set a standard of excellence for the reporters working for
him that has never been matched again,'' said Charles Dumas, the
chief capital correspondent during Paxton's tenure and now director
of communications for the New York state Senate.
   On his 20th anniversary at the bureau, Paxton won praise from
the Albany Knickerbocker News as ``a newspaperman's newspaper man.''
   Paxton was born in Richmond, Mo., and attended the College of
Emporia in Kansas, where he got his first taste of journalism doing
odd jobs for the Emporia Gazette.
   He worked at the Topeka State Journal, the Wichita Eagle, the
Pratt (Kansas) Tribune, the San Antonio Star and the Kansas City
Journal before joining the AP in Kansas City in 1926. He also
worked for the AP in New York before taking charge of the Albany
bureau.
   Paxton is survived by daughters Janet Cummings, a reporter, and
Laura Lee Nixon of Tokyo, three grandchildren and one great
grandchild.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

   Vietnamese Archbishop Philippe Nguyen
Kim Dien, who defied communist attempts to control his country's
Roman Catholic Church, died June 8. He was 67.
   The official Vietnam News Agency, in a report monitored in
Bangkok, said Dien died of an illness at Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi
Minh City, formerly Saigon. It gave no cause of death.
   Dien was barred from work as a priest and put under house arrest
in 1984 for urging priests not to join the Committee for Solidarity
of Patriotic Vietnamese Catholics. The state had formed the group
the previous year, and critics said it was designed to control the
church.
   While under house arrest, Dien continued to circulate letters
among his parishioners, and authorities apparently made no serious
attempt to replace him. He remained under house arrest until his
death.
   The Vatican said Kim was born in March 1921 in Vinh Long. The
city was a traditional center of the Catholic Church in the Mekong
River Delta in southern Vietnam. He was ordained in July 1947 and
became a bishop in 1961, the Vatican said.

   Thousands of gallons of water failed
to control a chlorine plant blaze that raged for a second day
Saturday, sending clouds of gas over the city, injuring 275 people
and forcing the evacuation of up to 30,000 residents.
   The city's five pumpers were turned on the Advanced Laboratories
factory in hopes of ``turning the plant into a big swimming pool,''
said Fire Department spokesman Giorgio Placanico.
   The attempt to extinguish the blaze remained unsuccessful late
Saturday. Fire engulfed the four-story building, sending flames 100
feet high and spreading the chlorine cloud about two miles long and
four blocks wide.
   Seven of the 125 firefighters battling the blaze were injured
Saturday night. More were on call from neighboring towns, Placanico
said.
   ``We're flooding it with everything we have,'' he said.
   Placanico said 20,000 to 30,000 people were evacuated and buses
still were transporting residents away from the area early Sunday.
   Earlier, the city extended an evacuation order to one mile
around the plant and 1{ miles to the northeast, where winds carried
gas clouds hundreds of feet tall over a residential area. Two city
high schools and a hospital were opened to house the evacuees.
   At least 150 people Saturday and 125 people Friday were treated
at three city hospitals for skin burns and respiratory problems
caused by the fumes, authorities said. There were no reports of
serious injuries.
   ``I don't need this and my kids don't need this,'' said Kathy
Trucx, an evacuee at Municipal Hospital, who said her two children
suffer from bronchitis.
   Authorities said they were abandoning an earlier plan to use 52
tons of neutralizing chemicals after dawn Sunday to try to put out
the blaze at the plant, which makes swimming pool chemicals.
   ``We just decided we can't wait until morning,'' Placanico said.
``It was too dangerous to leave alone.''
   The center of the fire Saturday was a room containing 600 to 800
barrels each filled with 300 pounds of granulated chlorine. The dry
compound is 90 percent chlorine, Placanico said.
   Explosions from the room came ``three and four and six a
minute'' after starting around noon Saturday, said John Higgins,
regional director of the state Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering.
   Higgins said authorities had planned to pump 26 tons each of
boric acid and sodium sulfate through fire hoses into the room
containing the barrels.
   Chlorine is flammable and can burn the skin and lungs. It can be
fatal in large concentrations.
   Around 6 p.m. Saturday, yellow-green clouds rising several
hundred feet were visible from a police and fire command post in a
gas station about two miles from the plant. Shortly afterward, the
command center also was evacuated.
   In some parts of town, visibility was limited to about 50 feet,
witnesses said.
   Some residents in this city of 170,000 were evacuated after the
fire broke out Friday morning and more than 6,000 people were
ordered from their homes Friday night after the fire engulfed three
stories of the brick plant.
   All but about 200 people were allowed to return home Saturday
morning, but when the evacuation area was expanded later in the
day, police with bullhorns herded many of the returnees into school
buses to leave the area.
   ``It smelled like pure bleach was coming through my window and
burning my eyes,'' said Judy Williams, 34, an evacuee at Municipal
Hospital.
   More than a dozen firefighters also were injured, including two
who were knocked against a wall by an exploding barrel around noon
Saturday.
   After Fire Chief Raymond S. Sullivan ordered 35 firefighters to
withdraw from the plant, more barrels could be heard exploding.
Firefighters in the building dove behind trucks.
   The first fire was ignited around 10 a.m. Friday by rain that
blew in an open window and set off highly reactive chlorine pellets
lying in a hopper, Placanico said.
   The first fire was small and quickly extinguished although the
fumes forced the evacuation of about 1,800 people, including 1,200
schoolchildren, he said. However, about 12 hours later, a passing
police officer spotted more flames and fumes.
   The second fire consumed most of one wing of the plant,
orginally a section of the Springfield Arsenal, and forced the
second evacuation.
   State Commissioner of Environmental Quality Engineering Daniel
S. Greenbaum said the old plant was equipped with a sprinkler
system that may have dampened additional barrels of chlorine and
sparked additional reactions and fires.
   State and federal officials will investigate the company's
operations, Greenbaum said.

   Congressmen touring the drought-stricken Plains promised farmers
Saturday they would introduce relief legislation, while dredges
continued cutting safe channels through shallow sections of the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
   ``This drought is very, very serious. It certainly the most
serious one in my lifetime this early in the year,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said
while visiting Aberdeen, S.D.
   Leahy, five other senators and two congressmen looked at acre
after acre of dry land and stunted crops east of Bismarck, N.D.,
later Saturday, then headed for Montana to continue their
information-collecting tour.
   The drought has not been limited to farmers or the Midwest. It
has left some bodies of water in the Southeast too low to supply
water to cool power plants. Officials of one Illinois town voted
Saturday to cut off water completely to customers who violate
conservation measures.
   ``We haven't had enough rain to amount to anything in five
years. It's pitiful,'' said David Lee Rhodes, whose family grows
apples near Edneyville, N.C., which hasn't had a soaking rain since
mid-April.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in only a few areas
Saturday, including parts of North Dakota, Kansas and Iowa, but an
area of high pressure building over the Rockies was expected to
extend the dry period.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson led a prayer for rain Saturday in the
drought-stricken cornfield of Dan Mau at Chatham, Ill., and then
told the state Democratic convention in nearby Springfield there
should be a national moratorium on farm disclosures. ``No one
should lose his land because of this drought,'' he said.
   In California, which has water problems of its own, Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley asked participants at his annual ``Mayor's Prayer
Breakfast'' to pray for farmers in dry regions of the nation.
``Those farmers suffer, their families suffer and all Americans
suffer as well,'' he said.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., told a group of farmers he has
drafted legislation to allow them to collect price supports known
as deficiency payments. ``The bill will be put in the hopper Monday
morning,'' he said.
   Under the 1985 Farm Bill the government won't make deficiency
payments if prices are high, and the drought is driving up prices.
But the drought may prevent farmers from producing a crop that they
could sell at the high prices.
   ``Deficiency payments are caught in a `catch-22' that did not
take into consideration a drought,'' Leahy said.
   Among the stops on the lawmakers' itinerary was the Fort Benton,
Mont., ranch of Mike O'Hara.
   ``We're completely out of stock water,'' O'Hara said in a
telephone interview. ``The last rain that we got that amounted to
anything was in August of '87.''
   An estimated 1,800 barges were backed up on the shrinking
Mississippi near Greenville, Miss., waiting for dredges to cut a
deep channel, while nearly 700 barges were stuck on the Ohio
awaiting dredging near Mound City, Ill.
   Late Saturday, barges began to move on both rivers, but traffic
was limited, authorities said.
   Bob Campbell, assistant chief of operations for the Army Corps
of Engineers' Vicksburg District, said it would take two to three
days to unsnarl the traffic along the Mississippi once the channel
was cleared.
   The Mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began
keeping records in 1872.
   Authorities said tow boat owners were losing about $10,000 a day
while they waited to move the barges, which carried grain,
chemicals, coal and oil.
   Dixie-Portland Flour Mills in Chattanooga, Tenn., had a shipment
of 50,000 bushels of wheat sitting on the Ohio River, and wheat
traffic manager George Norris said the company may have to resort
to more expensive rail shipping.
   At least one ship had to delay leaving New Orleans on Friday
because the barge tie-up kept its load of export coal from arriving
in time, officials said.
   The drought has cut the Tennessee Valley Authority's
hydroelectric power production nearly in half this year, and water
dropping below intake pipes or rising too high in temperature
threatens operation of the Sequoyah nuclear power plant near
Soddy-Daisy and the Allen Steam Plant near Memphis, said TVA Power
Manager Robert C. Steffy Jr. He said the Sequoyah plant, which
receives water from Lake Chickamauga, must have cooling water of
less than 83 degrees.
   The drought already has cost TVA more than $110 million in lost
power production from its hydroelectric dams.
   Village officials in Oak Brook, Ill., voted unanimously to shut
off water to homeowners who repeatedly violate water restrictions.
Authorities in the Chicago suburb issued more than 500 warnings
last week for violations of lawn watering limits designed to
conserve well water.

   A motorized canoe filled with
parents and children on a shopping trip for school's opening
capsized, drowning eight of the children, the military said Sunday.
   The boat overturned Saturday after it was buffeted by big waves
brought about by monsoon rains, said Lt. Col. Porcawa Dia, the
Philippine Constabulary commander on Basilan island. The accident
happened between the nearby islands of Bubuan and Saluping in the
Sulu archipelago nearly 600 miles miles south of Manila.
   The boat was carrying about 20 passengers from Bubuan island,
mostly parents and their elementary school children who were on a
last-minute shopping trip for supplies in Basilan for Monday's
school opening.
   Most of the passengers were able to swim back to the overturned
boat and were picked up by passing craft. However, eight of the
children were reported missing and believed to have drowned, Dia
said.
   The capsized craft, called a pumpboat or motorlaunch, is a
motorized canoe with outriggers. In some areas of the Philippines,
pumpboats are the only mode of transportation from one island to
another.
   Many such boats are small and can carry only a few people, but
others can transport up to 100 passengers.

   An Iraqi-backed rebel army opposed to the
regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Sunday it launched a
major offensive into western Iran, where it claimed it killed,
wounded, or captured thousands of Iranians.
   The National Liberation Army, an Iraq-based organization of
Iranians opposed to Khomeini's government, said its forces captured
Mehran, an Iranian town on the Iran-Iraq border 100 miles east of
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. It said its fighters had battled two
divisions of Iranian troops around the town.
   The official Iranian news agency, also monitored in Nicosia on
Sunday, confirmed fighting in the Mehran area. However, it said
fighting in the area pitted Iranian and Iraqi forces.
   One dispatch said a six-pronged attack on Mehran by Iraqi forces
was repulsed and only Iranian mopping-up operations were continuing.
   A second dispatch said clashes between Iranian and Iraqi forces
were intensifying west of Mehran. It said the Iraqis sustained
heavy casualties.
   The Iraq News Agency, quoting Iraq's minister of information,
Latif Nasif Jassim, denied that any Iraqi army troops were involved
in the Mehran offensive. It said all the attackers belonged to the
rebel group and they had captured Mehran.
   The rebels' statement said the offensive was the largest
operation yet undertaken by the rebels. It said the attack involved
22 brigades of combat and support troops and covered a front 31
miles wide.
   The group made its claims in a statement telexed to Nicosia from
Baghdad.
   ``Thousands of enemy troops under Khomeini's command have either
been killed, wounded or captured so far,'' the statement said. It
said strategic heights inside Iran had been captured and two
highways cut.
   The offensive was being led by rebel commander Massoud Rajavi,
the statement said.
   The National Liberation Army, formed a year ago, is built around
activists known as Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Warriors, who
helped Khomeini overthrow Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi in 1979.
However, they were later outlawed by Khomeini's Islamic
fundamentalists.
   They describe themselves as an Islamic movement seeking a
secular government.
   With Iraqi support, the rebel forces have been playing a small
but growing role in the Iran-Iraq war, in its eighth year.

   A political scandal is drawing sharp criticism of
the links between Japan's second-largest opposition party and the
huge Buddhist organization that supports it.
   Junya Yano, secretary-general of the Komeito, or Clean
Government Party, told reporters on June 10 that the removal of
outspoken parliamentarian Toshio Ohashi from the party roster was
not an effort to put a lid on dissent.
   ``If there is criticism, we must face it head-on,'' Yano said.
   According to Komeito leaders, Ohashi was given the boot on June
6 for womanizing and accepting bribes totaling $264,000.
   But the forced departure of Ohashi, 62, a member of the powerful
House of Representatives and a former kamikaze pilot, came shortly
after he published an article saying the party's independence had
been usurped by Daisaku Ikeda, honorary president of Japan's
largest religious group, the Soka Gakkai.
   ``(Ikeda) may publicly claim the separation of religion and
politics, but that is not the reality,'' Ohashi wrote in the June
edition of Bungei Shunju, a prestigious monthly magazine. ``Nothing
happens in the Gakkai or the party without his final OK.''
   Ohashi quoted former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's description
of Ikeda as a ``sutra-chanting Hitler,'' and said he was declaring
war on Ikeda to restore the integrity of the middle-of-the-road
Komeito.
   The Komeito has 200,000 members nationwide and holds 80 seats in
the two houses of Japan's parliament. All but eight of Komeito's
parliament members are Soka Gakkai adherents.
   The Soka Gakkai, founded on the ideals of a nationalistic brand
of Buddhism expounded by the 13th-century priest Nichiren, has 12
million members in Japan and 1.2 million overseas, including more
than 330,000 in the United States. Ikeda became its leader in 1960,
four years before the Komeito was established.
   In 1979 he retired as president following charges he was
creating a personality cult, but he has remained its honorary
president.
   The Komeito is the second-strongest opposition force after the
Japan Socialist Party, which has 110 parliament seats. When it was
founded, the Komeito advocated ``Buddhist democracy,'' a platform
later dropped as the Soka Gakkai officially withdrew from politics.
   But the division between religion and politics has often proved
to be a fine line.
   ``This is not a religious party,'' Takenori Kanzaki, head of the
party's International Division, said. ``Our party maintains clear
independence from the Soka Gakkai on all matters of policy and
personnel.''
   The Komeito says Ohashi's decision to oppose Ikeda was prompted
by party retirement rules that would make this Ohashi's last term
in office.
   Ohashi has denied this.
   Disciplinary action against an outspoken supporter of Ohashi,
Tokyo Municipal Assemblyman Yukimasa Fujiwara, is pending.
   According to Kanzaki, the Komeito will not support Fujiwara in
the next assembly elections.
   ``We decided last April to run another candidate,'' Kanzaki said
in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Ikeda has made no public response to Ohashi's statement, but
Kanzaki said Ohashi's comments were ``untrue, and contain many
perversions of the facts.''
   A party member who requested anonymity said rumors about
Ohashi's misconduct had been ``making the rounds since late last
year,'' and the Bungei Shunju article was simply the last straw.
   At his press conference June 10, Yano said the Komeito had not
become a ``personal possession of Ikeda,'' though it ``incorporates
several religious ideas.''
   ``The Komeito is a public party, not a religious organ,'' he
said. ``Though we do at times accept pleas from the Soka Gakkai to
uphold public morals, that is only natural. It is the
responsibility of our supporters to make such pleas.''

   Suspected Sikh extremists threw a bomb
Sunday into a crowd watching a Hindu religious series on a
community television, killing at least 15 people and injuring about
30 others, a news agency said.
   The attack was carried out in a market in the town of
Kurukshetra in northern Haryana state, according to the Press Trust
of India news agency. The town is considered holy by Hindus.
   Six of the injured were reported in critical condition at local
hospitals, it said.
   It reported the market was littered with limbs and torn flesh of
the victims.
   The attack came as the crowd and an estimated 100 million
Indians tuned in to state-run television nationwide to watch the
weekly ``Ramayana'' show, which recounts the adventures of the
Hindu god Lord Rama.
   The town of Kurukshetra is holy to Hindus because it was there
that Lord Krishna, an incarnation of one of Hindu's trinity of
gods, gave a lecture on battling for righteousness. His army later
went on to defeat a rival Aryan tribe.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   Earlier Sunday, Punjab police said that three policemen were
killed overnight in two separate attacks by Sikh radicals. They
also were blamed for the death Sunday of a Sikh farmer in central
Punjab.
   Also Sunday, Sikh radicals ambushed a car carrying a militant
Hindu leader in Punjab state, killing him, his bodyguard and an
aide, the news agency said.
   The Hindu leader was identified as Rama Kant Jalota, president
of the Punjab Shiv Sena, or army of Shiva. The Shiv Sena views
itself as a defender of Hindus and their religion.
   The news agency said Jalota's car was attacked as he was en
route to Jalandhar, which is a district capital 50 miles southeast
of Amritsar.
   The latest killings raised to more than 1,320 the number of
people killed by the radicals in Punjab since the start of the
year. Last year, 1,030 people died.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed
to the militants' separatist campaign. The radicals have at times
targeted police, government officials and their families.
   Sunday's attack was the second bombing by Sikh extremists
outside Punjab in less than a month.
   On May 20, a series of bombs went off on several buses in
Himachal Pradesh state northeast of Punjab. At least 10 people died.
   The last Sikh attack in Haryana, south of Punjab, came on May 8,
when Sikh extremists attacked a Hindu wedding party. At least 14
people were killed and 26 injured.

<HEAD>Convention Reconvenes After Attempted Assassination Of Premier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The governing Motherland Party's general
congress met under tight security Sunday after an escaped convict
shot and slightly wounded Premier Turgut Ozal in the convention
hall.
   Turkish newspapers reported Sunday that seven different
underground groups claimed responsibility for the assassination
attempt, which left Ozal wounded in the right hand. The claims,
which included Marxist-Leninist, rightist and Moslem factions,
could not be confirmed independently.
   Delegates gave Ozal a standing ovation when he arrived at the
convention hall Sunday. He greeted his supporters with his right
hand in a bandage and his arm hanging in a sling.
   Ozal, 61, was delivering an opening speech at the convention
Saturday when a gunman fired twice at him.
   Police fired at the suspected assailant, hitting him in the arm,
as scores of screaming people ran for cover in panic. Sixteen other
people suffered bullet wounds from the returning fire of bodyguards
and four were bruised in the stampede.
   According to an announcement from Numune Hospital, 10 people
remained hospitalized on Sunday.
   The suspected gunman, identified as Kartal Demirag, 32, was
convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison
last year, Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said. He escaped from a
low-security Mugla prison in January, the governor said.
   Beduk said the handgun that was seized had jammed after two
shots were fired.
   Newspapers reported that Demirag was a member of the now defunct
neo-fascist National Movement Party's youth organization before
1980. Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman wounded Pope John Paul II
in 1981, was also accused of belonging to the group.
   Newspapers reported that the assailant had either one or two
accomplices who escaped later. Beduk denied the reports.
   Beduk also said no one remained under custody except the gunman
on Sunday. About 50 people were taken into custody Saturday in an
attempt to determine whether people involved in the decoration of
the convention hall were responsible in smuggling the gun.
   Ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.

   Thousands of residents began returning
to their homes early Sunday as firefighters extinguished a chlorine
plant blaze that spread a cloud of toxic gas over two cities,
injuring 275 people.
   The fire, which started Friday, was finally put out Sunday
morning, and fire officials reduced the off-limits zone from 2{
miles to a quarter-mile.
   ``It's the worst public health and environmental disaster in the
past 20 years,'' said John J. Higgins, regional director for the
state Department of Environmental Quality Engineering. The
department took air readings in area churches to see if it was safe
for people to attend Sunday services.
   Authorities Sunday lowered their estimate of the number of
people evacuated from about 30,000 to 10,000 to 15,000. Some of
those returning home Sunday morning had been away for two nights.
   Fumes had stopped forming into the dense cloud of dangerous gas
that had spread throughout the area earlier, said Fire Commissioner
Darnell Williams. Firefighters poured about 14,000 pounds of water
on the blaze every minute during the height of the battle.
   Seven of the 125 firefighters on the line were injured Saturday
night or Sunday morning.
   The old wood and brick building, onetime home of the Springfield
Arsenal, was used by the Advanced Laboratories Co. to make chlorine
products for swimming pools.
   The fire engulfed the two-story, block-long building with
three-story towers, sending flames 100 feet into the air early
Sunday. Officials said a cloud of chlorine fumes about two miles
long blew northeast across the city of 170,000.
   One large room in the building was believed to contain 600 to
800 barrels, each holding about 300 pounds of granulated dry
chlorine, Fire Department spokesman Giorgio Placanico said.
   The fumes went into the adjacent community of Chicopee where
Mayor Joseph Chesney ordered a voluntary evacuation of three
neighborhoods near the city line.
   Fire officials said the Clean Harbors Co. of Kingston, a
hazardous waste firm, brought in a truckload of sodium sulfate, a
neutralizing chemical, early Sunday.
   However, Williams said any use of sodium sulfate or boric acid
would be held up until fire officials are sure they know what was
stored in the big building for fear of creating other problems.
   The city extended an evacuation order to residential
neighborhoods one mile around the plant and 1{ miles to the
northeast.
   Placanico said 20,000 to 30,000 people were evacuated and
several thousand were in four emergency shelters. Others went to
stay with friends or relatives, or waited in unaffected areas of
the city in hopes the cloud would disperse soon.
   Two elderly residents declined to leave their homes and were
brought out by police, said James Controvich, city emergency
response coordinator. State troopers came in to help guard affected
areas, but there had been no problems with looters.
   Officials said 150 people were treated at three city hospitals
Saturday, while 125 had been treated on Friday for skin burns and
respiratory problems caused by the corrosive chlorine fumes. No
serious injuries were reported.
   Chlorine is flammable and can burn the skin and lungs. It can be
fatal in large concentrations. Firefighters could get no closer
than 100 feet from the building, even with protective gear.
   Some residents had been evacuated after the fire broke out
Friday morning, but most were allowed to return home later.
   However, more than 6,000 people were ordered from their homes
Friday night after the rekindled fire engulfed a wing of the
four-story brick and wood plant.
   Two city high schools, a hospital and the Springfield Civic
Center were opened to house the evacuees.

<HEAD>Falling Water Level May Raise Pollution Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought staggering America's farmlands may
pose a danger for the rest of the nation, too _ increased pollution
in the rivers, lakes and wells that provide drinking water and
recreation.
   Millions of streams and rivers across the nation carry off
sewage, industrial wastes, agricultural chemicals and other
pollutants. Some people describe the process with the rhyme: ``The
solution to pollution is dilution.''
   ``Just common sense would tell you that if you have less flow in
a stream, there is less dilution of whatever components are being
carried by that stream,'' pointed out Ben Jones, assistant regional
hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
   There have, for example, been recent complaints from Northern
California that large volumes of sewage discharge had appeared in
streams.
   These were streams where there was normally enough water to
handle the treated sewage, Jones said. But because of dry
conditions, suddenly the volume of sewage exceeded that of clean
water and people reacted to the sudden change.
   Drought-induced low water in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers has
attracted attention by stranding barges, but it also has
concentrated pollutants in those rivers, which accept the runoff
from much of the nation.
   Bob Meade of the Geological Survey's Denver office has just
returned from a water-quality survey of the Mississippi. One of the
things the scientists found was a broken sewer in Memphis, spewing
thousands of gallons of what he termed ``floatable solids'' into
the river.
   Meade's detailed pollution measurements won't be completed for
months, but he concurred with Jones that reduced river flows
increase the concentrations of chemicals like nitrates and
herbicides that are dissolved in the water.
   Warm weather and low water levels lead to stress on much aquatic
life, added Gary Pederson, a survey hydrologist in Atlanta.
   For one thing, warmer water can hold less dissolved oxygen,
Pederson explained. That, in itself, can be a problem for fish and
other aquatic life. Moreover, because oxygen is needed to help
clean the water, low water and less oxygen increases the chances of
the water becoming toxic.
   The survey's monthly analysis of the nation's streams and rivers
showed flows at below normal in May in the Pacific Northwest,
California, the Great Plains and the Southeast.
   The Mississippi marked its second lowest flow in 60 years while
the St. Lawrence, the nation's second largest river, fell below
normal for the first time since 1967.
   May saw five record low stream flows recorded at locations in
Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Arkansas, the survey reported.
   In addition to lakes and rivers, known as surface water,
millions of Americans depend on ground water: those great
underground pools tapped by wells.
   ``As a drought deepens and strengthens, people tend to go more
and more to ground water supplies as a source,'' Jones added. And
in some cases they may start to pump water from underground
aquifers which are not normally used.
   Ground water is already more concentrated with minerals because
of its longer contact with them, he noted. ``As water supplies
become less and less available for agriculture, there will be more
and more chance of arid areas having soil begin to salt up from
water with a higher mineral content,'' he said.
   Salt-laden soil already has been reported as a problem in some
parts of the Southwest.

<TEXT>
   Louise Lindblom surveyed the crowd that
turned out for Michael Dukakis. ``People who've worked in every
campaign in Alabama since 1960 _ they showed up this afternoon,''
she said.
   She pointed out Billy Joe Camp who was a leading backer of
George C. Wallace and a minister who was Alabama chairman for
George McGovern in 1972.
   ``I've never seen them all together at one time,'' said
Lindblom, a veteran of state and national Democratic Party politics.
   It was a remarkable turnout in a state the Massachusetts
governor had little reason to think he could carry against
Republican George Bush in the fall presidential election.
   The Democratic presidential candidate carried Alabama only once
in the last six elections.
   A three-day trip through seven Southern states that his staff
described as the first swing of the general election campaign was
marked by the turnout of Democratic Party officials, people who
often had kept their distance from their party's presidential
nominees in recent elections.
   ``Folks who hid out before, they ain't hiding out on Mike
Dukakis,'' said Larry Harrington, an aide to Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr.
   Gore endorsed Dukakis on this trip and so did Gov. Ray Maybus of
Mississippi and both talked about their willingness to campaign for
the Massachusetts governor.
   Equally significant, if not more so, was the willingness of
party officials and members of Congress to come out and be seen in
public with the Massachusetts politician who has locked up their
party's presidential nomination. The victory of a man perceived
early on as a Northern liberal was an outcome they had hoped to
avoid when they banded together to get nearly all Southern states
to hold primaries on March 8, an effort designed to give one of
their own a shot at the nomination.
   But Dukakis has shaken that label and the Southerners appeared
comfortable with him, far more comfortable than they ever were with
Walter Mondale in 1984.
   ``Everybody committed to help us put together the coalition we
need to win in the fall,'' said Donna Brazile, deputy political
director of the campaign.
   ``Will you help us?'' she said the politicians were asked during
private meetings at every stop. ``They said yes.''
   ``It was a good three days,'' Dukakis said as he flew back to
Boston.
   The Southern trip was a statement by Dukakis, a challenge to
Bush on what the vice president thought was his own turf, his
political base.
   ``I wanted so very much to make this first swing of the campaign
in the South,'' Dukakis told the rally in the Alabama capital.
   He said he wanted to demonstrate that ``I'm serious and you're
serious about campaigning hard in the South, working hard in the
South and winning the South.''
   He offered Southern voters the kind of tough talk about crime
and drugs that they want to hear and showed no sign of being
rattled by the Republican surrogates who preceded him at many stops
and branded him a ``Teddy Kennedy liberal'' from Massachusetts who
was soft on crime.
   Dukakis pointed to statistics that showed his state has the
lowest homicide rate of any industrial state and also had one of
the largest drops in major crime.
   The Massachusetts governor dismissed criticism from one such
surrogate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as the words of someone who
``doesn't know beans from brown bread.''
   When Bush attacked Dukakis for a program under which criminals
are permitted brief furloughs from prisons, even convicted
murderers, the Dukakis' staff was quick to point out that
California had a similar program under Gov. Ronald Reagan.
   Opinion polls certainly had a role in encouraging Southern
Democratic politicians to stand by their certain nominee.
   The day Dukakis arrived in the region a new survey by
Atlanta-based pollster Clairborne Darden of voters in nine states
in the region said Dukakis was leading Bush by a narrow margin of
45 percent to 42 percent, within the poll's 3 percent margin of
error.
   But those politicians knew better than to put much faith in
polls at this stage of a campaign.
   They also knew that most of their states have been regularly
supporting Republican presidential candidates for two decades with
the exception of 1976 when Georgian Jimmy Carter was the Democratic
nominee.
   A lot of things can change the campaign mood in the months
before Election Day.
   Dukakis still must deal with Jesse Jackson, find common ground
on issues without seeming to cave in to the former civil rights
activist, resist demands without alienating black voters who are an
indispensable part of the Democratic coalition.
   ``There's a lot of indecision among blacks,'' said Brazile, who
worked with Jackson in his 1984 presidential campaign.
   ``People don't know who Mike Dukakis is,'' she said. ``All they
know about Mike Dukakis is he was Jesse Jackson's competitor and
he's a Democrat and a good Democrat.''
   B.A. McDowell, a doctor from Bessemer, stood at the back of the
crowd and listened to Dukakis.
   A Jackson supporter in the Alabama primary, McDowell said he
thought Dukakis needed help in the South, the kind of help he'd get
from a Southern running mate, somebody like Gore or Sen. Sam Nunn
of Georgia.
   ``The general consensus, I think, in the black community is
Jesse ought to be offered it (the vice presidential nomination),''
McDowell said. ``But the politicians who know how things work say
if Jackson is on the ticket he's going to run all the white folks
off.''
   Was McDowell impressed with Dukakis?
   ``I think he's all right,'' he said. ``He's the closest thing
we've got to a winner.''

<HEAD>Senators' Feud on Judgeship Nominations Hits Boiling Point</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sens. Patrick J. Leahy and Strom Thurmond have
been locked in a partisan snit for months over the pace of
judgeship confirmations, and last week, the feud just about reached
the boiling point.
   The two met privately, senator-to-senator, in an anteroom
outside a committee room as staffers outside the door could hear _
as one described it _ ``the decibel level rise.''
   The trouble began in the opening moments of a hearing for a
judicial nominee from California, when Thurmond, R-S.C., asked that
testimony get under way.
   Leahy, a liberal Democrat from Vermont, who was presiding, chose
instead to read his entire single-spaced, 10-page letter to
Thurmond, denying that Democrats were stalling President Reagan's
court nominees.
   It wasn't long before Leahy's cigar smoke wafted toward
Thurmond, whose disdain for smoking is equaled only by his low
regard for alcohol and liberals. Thurmond kept waving papers to
deflect the thickening smoke.
   Later, when Thurmond asked witnesses opposing the nominee if
they belonged to gay or lesbian groups, Leahy accused his rival of
McCarthyism.
   Then, as the hearing ended, Leahy cleared the area of staffers,
and the blunt-speaking former prosecutor from Vermont and the
85-year-old former judge from South Carolina had their meeting.
   ``Sometimes you need conversations that are senator to
senator,'' Leahy said.
   But, lucky for Leahy, Thurmond didn't resort to the method of
resolving disputes that he used more than 20 years ago.
   In that instance, Thurmond's opponent was former liberal
Democratic Sen. Ralph Yarborough of Texas. And instead of moving
behind closed doors, the two senators, both 61 at the time,
wrestled on the floor outside a Senate Commerce Committee room. The
issue was Thurmond's attempt to stall a vote on a director for a
civil rights panel.
   Still, according to reports at the time, the battle that July
day in 1964 ``was good tempered,'' with ``no sharp words exchanged
before or after.''
   The feud between Thurmond and Leahy, on the other hand, has
become a very personal affair, especially to Leahy, who accused
Thurmond of hounding him to speed up confirmation hearings even
while Leahy's son was hospitalized for surgery.
   Thurmond, for his part, denied that there's anything personal
involved. ``I feel sorry his son was hospitalized,'' he said,
adding he has an obligation as ranking GOP committee member to
represent Republicans who believe their court nominees are victims
of a Democratic stall.
   Leahy countered that most nominees are moving ahead in timely
fashion, but blamed any delays on his party's refusal to rubber
stamp the president's candidates, and on Justice Department delays
in responding to committee information requests.
   To complicate matters, Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., has been recuperating at home from two aneurysm
operations, and is unable to act as a peacemaker.
   When Republicans controlled the Senate and Thurmond was
Judiciary Committee chairman from 1981-86, Biden developed a
special relationship with the South Carolina lawmaker. The two like
each other personally, keep the level of animosity low when they
disagree, and often work out compromise legislation on key issues.
   While Leahy has handled confirmation hearings for the committee,
Biden has been heavily involved in judgeship issues. He has
promised that every nominee would receive a fair hearing and a
vote. He likely would have tried to defuse the Leahy-Thurmond
battle.
   Leahy said in an interview that GOP senators who sponsored
nominees _ and the candidates themselves _ have been complimentary
on the fairness of their hearings.
   ``I told Thurmond I can't understand what his motives are in
constantly raising questions of delay, when other senators don't
see that at all,'' Leahy said. ``I said all the people who Biden
promised will get votes will (get them).
   ``I asked why he raised questions which he keeps asking over and
over again. He even did so in a week when I had a son in for
serious surgery. I didn't find his answers satisfactory.''
   Thurmond, in an interview, said he told Leahy ``There's been
delay after delay. I said Biden promised to have these judges acted
on, and he (Leahy) was not following that course.''
   One Democratic source, knowledgeable about the feud, said, ``I
don't think there's any way to control what two senators do in the
absence of the chairman.
   ``There's no doubt Thurmond would be going to Biden and trying
to work out something. But to say Biden could have kept this from
hard feelings, is an overstatement.''
   Thurmond has shown an ability to behave as a true Southern
gentleman.
   And Thurmond decided to play the gentleman last week, when asked
if he resented Leahy sending cigar smoke his way.
   ``The wind was blowing that way,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Government to Seek to Ban Under-16s From Game Arcades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study showing that as many as 100,000 youths
skip school daily to play slot machines has prompted the government
to propose banning children under 16 from arcades, a report said
Sunday.
   The government will recommend the new law next month when the
Home Office releases the study by a psychiatrist, who estimates
that 500,000 British children are hooked on the machines, The
Sunday Times reported.
   Emanuel Moran, who conducted the study, compared an addiction to
slot machines to dependencies on alcohol or drugs, the report said.
   ``When children find themselves in that situation, it's a type
of desperation,'' the report quoted Moran as saying.
   ``Even if they get over it, they have wasted vital years,'' he
said. ``If you go into the history of people who, in adulthood, had
a serious gambling problem, large numbers of them started in their
teens.''
   Moran was quoted as saying that young people addicted to the
machines steal money from their parents or friends to gamble.
   British laws say people under the age of 18 cannot gamble, but
the report said slot machines are available to children in
amusement arcades, railway stations and other public places.
   A voluntary industry code says that children under the age of 16
should not be allowed to enter gaming arcades unless accompanied by
an adult.
   In order to turn the code into law, the report said the
government plans to give local authorities stricter licensing
powers and create penalties for arcade operators who break the new
rules.
   It quoted Alan Willis, general secretary of the British
Amusement Catering Trades Association, as saying his group opposed
the proposed changes.
   ``We accept there are one or two young people with problems, but
the numbers are small,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He said his association was working to tighten its disciplinary
procedures but felt that the voluntary industry code was effective
in keeping young children from the arcades.

   West Berlin police clashed with about 500 rock
music fans who hurled bottles and cans at the stage after a concert
at the Berlin Wall, officials said Sunday.
   The violence erupted after the concert, part of a three-night
``Berlin Rock Marathon'' featuring such stars as Pink Floyd and
Michael Jackson, ended Saturday night.
   Several thousand of the estimated 35,000 concert-goers shouted
for encores, police said.
   Most fans left after being asked to do so, but about 500
remained behind, including neo-Nazis. Police said they set small
fires and threw beer bottles and cans at the stage.
   Police charged at the troublemakers, scuffling with a number of
them, authorities said. Two police officers received minor
injuries, and eight people were arrested.
   Among charges against the eight were inflicting bodily harm and
circulating Nazi pamphlets, police said.
   The rock marathon began Friday and concludes Sunday with a
performance by Jackson.

about 25 others, the United News of India reported.
   Witnesses told the news agency that the accident occurred when
the truck driver lost control of his vehicle and it hit the bus.
The truck driver was among those killed, UNI said.
   The wreckage blocked the highway for nearly two hours, the
agency said.
   Meerut is 50 miles northeast of New Delhi.

   Radical students demanding the
execution of former President Chun Doo-hwan battled riot police
with firebombs and rocks Sunday after they were blocked from
marching to Chun's house.
   Police with shields hurled tear gas grenades when about 100
students tried to force their way through police lines after a
rally at Yonsei University in Seoul. Hundreds of other students
cheered the marchers.
   ``Execute Chun Doo-hwan!'' the students yelled as they attacked
riot police with firebombs, rocks and iron and wooden clubs.
   Hundreds of people out for Sunday walks ran from the flying
rocks and firebombs or cried and choked because of tear gas.
   ``They should beat them. This is outrageous,'' complained a
middle-aged man in a suit as he ran for cover.
   Police outnumbered the radicals and had few problems containing
them. The protest was smaller than most recent clashes have been.
   Student leaders demanded that Chun and his successor, Roh
Tae-woo, be punished for the bloody suppression of a 1980
anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju in which
nearly 200 people died, according to government figures. Chun and
Roh were top generals at the time.
   The unpopular former president stepped down in February after
heading an authoritarian government that suppressed opposition and
imposed rigid controls for seven years.
   Hundreds of police guarded Chun's house and roads leading to it
in a residential area about one mile from Yonsei.
   Two police vans, supported by scores of charging troopers, drove
protesters back with clouds of white tear gas pumped out by
machines.
   Several police officers and protesters were injured by rocks and
other missiles. Police did not report any arrests.
   Police seized several boxes of firebombs from marchers that
officers said were to be used in an attack on Chun's residence. Six
students were arrested June 16 when about 20 radicals with
firebombs tried to attack the former president's home.
   Radical student leaders denounced Chun and Roh at a rally at
Yonsei before Sunday's march and demanded Chun's execution for
murder and corruption.
   Roh took power Feb. 25 after presidential elections. He has
pledged to punish corruption and any other misdeeds under the past
administration.
   They have demanded a probe into alleged corruption under the
Chun regime. The former president's younger brother, Chun
Kyung-Hwan, has been charged with embezzling millions of dollars in
government funds in a massive extortion and influence peddling
scheme.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' about 300 students
chanted Sunday. They carried a banner that read, ``Execute the
Chun-Roh clique.''
   Hundreds of riot police in combat fatigues and visored helmets
charged the radicals several times to force them back. Police
armored vans fired barrages of tear gas into the ranks of the
students as rifle squads fired tear gas canisters.
   Waves of students pelted police with firebombs that exploded in
orange showers of blazing gasoline. Several troopers were covered
in flames that were quickly extinguished by other officers.
   The National Assembly is expected to consider opposition calls
this week to establish committees to investigate the Kwangju
revolt, corruption and other matters. The governing Democratic
Justice Party lost its majority in the assembly in April 26
elections.

   A dissident said Sunday that police detained five
people who planned to protest in Moscow for return of the Crimean
Tatars' homeland, taken away by Josef Stalin.
   Alexander Podrabinek said four Crimean Tatars were detained
Sunday morning for alleged violation of internal passport laws.
Podrabinek, editor of the weekly dissident journal
Express-Khronika, said a fifth man was arrested Saturday.
   He said those detained Sunday included a Muscovite, Yevgeny
Ametov, and three Tatars from the Krasnodar area of southern
Russia. He did not identify them.
   Podrabinek said the man detained Saturday was Reshat Zhemilev of
Tashkent in Soviet Uzbekistan.
   Ametov and the three Tatars from Krasnodar had planned to
present a petition at Communist Party Central Committee
headquarters Monday demanding that a party conference that opens
June 28 consider returning their homeland to them.
   Podrabinek said about 50 police and plainclothes agents detained
them near a monument to Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, where they
were meeting with Moscow residents to explain their demands.
   The three had arrived from Krasnodar on Saturday, he said.
   Soviets may be in a location other than their home for 72 hours
without registering with authorities.
   Another dissident, Valery Senderov, said Zhemilev had been in
Moscow for several weeks before being detained on a street
Saturday. He said he had no other information about the arrest.
   Crimean Tatars, descendants of the Mongols, were exiled from
their homeland by Stalin for allegedly collaborating with Nazi
invaders in World War II. Many died on their way to regions of the
Ural Mountains and Soviet Central Asia.
   Hundreds of Tatars converged on Moscow last summer, and in late
July they staged an overnight protest in Red Square.
   The Soviet government formed a commission under President Andrei
A. Gromyko to study their demands and then forcibly removed them
from Moscow several weeks later when they refused to go home.

   President George Vassiliou has agreed to
meet with the leader of this Mediterranean island's breakaway
Turkish state to discuss reunification, an official announcement
said Sunday.
   Vassiliou agreed Saturday to a proposal by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to hold talks with Rauf
Denktash, the government announcement said.
   In a recent report to the U.N. Security Council, Perez de
Cuellar said he had proposed to Vassiliou and Denktash that they
meet soon without preconditions to seek a settlement based on a
two-state federation.
   The announcement said Vassiliou ``decided to respond positively
and accept the U.N. secretary-general's proposals as they stand.''
   A Greek Cypriot official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the talks may start in July in Geneva during a scheduled visit
there by Perez de Cuellar.
   Turkish Cypriot officials have indicated Denktash would accept
the secretary-general's proposal and meet with Vassiliou, but no
official announcement has been made.
   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish troops invaded in 1974 and
captured the northern third of the island after a Greek Cypriot
coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
   Turkish Cypriots, who comprise one-fifth of the island's 650,000
people, have formed their own breakaway state, headed by Denktash,
in the Turkish-controlled territory.
   Several rounds of talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriot
leaders, under U.N. mediation, have failed to resolve disputes over
the form of a federation and withdrawal of about 29,000 Turkish
troops stationed on northern Cyprus.

   Radical students seeking revolutionary
change are waging a violent struggle in the streets that poses a
threat to South Korea's fragile political stability.
   The nation has been hit by a new wave of political violence in
the past month as the radicals have battled riot police and staged
firebomb attacks to press for the fall of the government, expulsion
of U.S. troops and unification of the Korean Peninsula.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' ``Yankee go home!'' and
``Unite our fatherland!'' protesters have chanted.
   Radical leaders insist that President Roh Tae-woo's government
is a front for military rule and domination by the United States,
which has 42,000 troops stationed in South Korea.
   The radicals reject recent democratic reforms and say they are
determined to topple the government and the ruling elite through
violence.
   Analysts say the students have little chance of achieving their
goals.
   The radicals account for only about 10 percent of South Korea's
1 million college students.
   They have lost support and become isolated as most Koreans have
welcomed recent political reforms and rejected the extremism.
   But some analysts say the students are nevertheless an explosive
and unpredictable factor in a nation with a history of violent and
uncompromising political confrontation. They say the radicals are
dominating South Korea's politics and derailing the political
process.
   ``This nation is now experiencing a most difficult period. We
have the still very serious problem of college campus unrest,''
said Rhee Chong-ik, a political analyst.
   ``It is deplorable for the government to have become the
prisoner of activist students,'' said political commentator Chong
Un-bung.
   The radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds.
Children of senior officials and military officers join children of
workers and poor farmers in campus groups that embrace a common
idealism and anger at government abuses over the years.
   The movement is bolstered by anti-government dissidents and
intellectuals who for years battled South Korea's authoritarian
governments. Some unemployed continue radical activity after
college, including many who are blacklisted because of their
records and are unable to get good jobs.
   Observers worry about the long-term impact of radicalism, since
many bright and talented students with potentially important roles
in the country's future are attracted to the radical ranks.
   The radicals _ who are often vague about their goals _ say they
are fighting for the creation of an idealistic ``society of the
masses,'' with students, workers and peasants uniting to end
oppression, poverty and exploitation. Radical leaders stress that
the solution to the nation's problems is to destroy the power of
the military, government bureaucracy and major corporations that
dominate the economy.
   ``We feel in our hearts that something must be done now. People
just talk, and the government uses that to continue its rule. We
must act to force change,'' said one leader, who refused to be
named.
   The radicals' philosophy of forcing change was demonstrated June
10 when they attempted to march to the border with communist North
Korea to press for reunification of the Korean Peninsula, divided
since 1945.
   The government blocked the march and radicals fiercely battled
police.
   Many South Koreans, who fear the North is determined to conquer
the South, were stunned by the sight of the radicals embracing one
of the world's most oppressive regimes.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to spark the Korean War.
   The radicals have also stressed anti-Americanism, accusing the
United States of controlling South Korea's governments and dividing
the peninsula to rule the South.
   Protesters have attacked U.S. diplomatic facilities.
   Government officials and critics accuse the radicals of being
``utopian romantics'' or ``communist dupes'' and say they are
immature and ignorant about politics and ideology.
   Officials also worry the radicals will drift toward terrorism.
They point to Japan's Red Army and other terrorist groups that
evolved out of similar radical movements.
   But many South Koreans have mixed feelings about the students
because of the country's long and honorable tradition of student
activism.
   Students helped lead the struggle against the Japanese colonial
occupation during the first half of the century. The students also
played a key role in overthrowing the dictatorial regime of former
President Syngman Rhee in 1960 and headed opposition to more recent
authoritarian governments.

<HEAD>Nunn Says Enlisting Military Not Sole Answer To Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee has a simple response to those who insist the war against
illegal drugs can be won with legislation requiring the military to
seal U.S. borders against narcotics traffickers.
   ``If you passed it, it would be like passing a law saying it
shall rain two inches in the Midwest by Sunday morning,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``You can pass it and it makes you feel good but
it's not going to do anything.''
   The House, however, passed such legislation just last month as
part of its defense budget bill for fiscal year 1989. The Senate
also included an anti-drug provision in its version of the defense
bill, although it did not go nearly as far as the House.
   The Senate bill would give the military a greater role in the
detection and tracking of drug smugglers, would allow the use of
military equipment and personnel in border enforcement and would
give the Navy limited arrest powers outside U.S. waters.
   Nunn, who persuaded the Senate two years ago to reject a similar
House proposal to use the military to seal the borders against drug
traffickers, helped fashion the compromise amendment the Senate
attached to its defense bill.
   But in an interview last week, Nunn said he's still not
convinced Congress should extend arrest powers to the military. He
described his involvement in the development of the Senate drug
interdiction plan as ``an effort to make some sense out of the bill
that was inevitably going to pass.
   ``You sort of sense the mood of a body and something was going
to pass,'' he said. ``The Senate of the United States was going to
shake its fist and say to the people of the country, we have dealt
with the drug problem, we have sicked the military on them.''
   Nunn said the chorus of election-year calls in Congress for
greater military involvement in the anti-drug effort is just
another example of the propensity on Capitol Hill for proposing
easy answers to complex problems.
   ``There is no easy answer,'' he said. ``This is a deep societal
problem and we have to treat it in a multifaceted way, with
education, and with health preventive measures and also with law
enforcement and interdiction.
   ``If you get all the effort on interdiction, and you don't do
anything about cutting down the demand side, the drug user is going
to find some way to get drugs in here,'' he said.
   Since both houses approved their anti-drug amendments to the
defense bill during floor debate, bypassing the normal committee
process, Nunn took the unusual step two weeks ago of scheduling
hearings by his committee on an issue that already had been acted
on.
   The message from most witnesses at those hearings was strikingly
similar to what Nunn has been preaching: that past drug
interdiction efforts haven't been effective in slowing the flow of
drugs into the country and that anti-drug efforts should be focused
more on curbing demand.
   ``The most you can do with interdiction is make the price
higher,'' Nunn said. ``And making the price higher is a worthy goal
because it cuts down consumption. But making the price higher
doesn't solve the problem.''
   Nunn, who now is heading the House-Senate conference on the
defense bill, said he hopes the panel will not decide on a major
increase in drug intediction efforts by the military.
   The House proposal to seal the borders, he said, would cost $3
billion to $5 billion and likely would do little more than force
the drug smugglers to shift their operations.
   Ideally, Nunn said, the military's role in the drug war should
be limited to gathering intelligence on the source of illegal
drugs, conducting surveillance of ships and planes suspected of
carrying drugs and communicating that information to civilian law
enforcement authorities.
   If the military carries out those three tasks effectively, he
said, then domestic law enforcement agencies should be able to
handle the arrests of drug traffickers without any help from the
military, he said.

   The landmark Cipollone cigarette liability
case boiled down to a few key questions, not all of which got
definitive answers.
   The question asked by the cigarette makers was, should a company
really be forced to pay money because a smoker contracted lung
cancer when she knew people were saying cigarettes were dangerous?
   Attorneys for Rose Cipollone, who died in 1984 at 58 after four
decades of smoking, put it another way: shouldn't the makers of her
cigarettes _ just like any other company _ be held responsible for
their actions in making a potentially dangerous product?
   And the 4{-month trial, which ended a week ago Monday with the
nation's first liability finding against the industry, posed a
broader question: Is the courtroom the place to change public
policy?
   The jury cleared Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip
Morris Inc. of conspiring to misrepresent the dangers of smoking.
   But it granted $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone in finding that
Liggett, which made the cigarettes his wife smoked before warning
labels were put on packs in 1966, violated advertising promises
that its products were safe.
   The jury also partly found against Liggett on a failure-to-warn
claim, determining the company should have told consumers of
smoking's risks before 1966, that the omission contributed to Mrs.
Cipollone's smoking and that the smoking contributed to her death.
   Yet the panel said Mrs. Cipollone was mostly responsible for her
injuries and thus not entitled to damages.
   Aside from the industry's exoneration on the fraud conspiracy
claim, company lawyers said they essentially won the case because
the jury found Mrs. Cipollone responsible for her injuries,
supporting the classic industry argument that smokers make an
independent, intelligent choice to smoke.
   But Cipollone's lawyers said the verdict supported the charge
that smoking causes cancer _ which the industry denies has been
proven _ and that actions by a cigarette maker can be blamed for a
smoker's disease.
   Industry victory proclamations caused some skepticism in
anti-smoking ranks.
   ``To me, it seems like the captain of the Titanic saying, `Just
a little ice, folks,''' said Don Davis, an Austin, Texas, attorney
whose firm handles cigarette liability cases.
   Both sides promised an appeal. They have until June 29 to file
post-trial motions with U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin, with
oral arguments expected toward the end of July.
   Anti-smoking advocates see liability cases as a way of reducing
the number of smokers, raising the price of cigarettes through
mounting industry legal bills and drumming up public opinion
against cigarettes. But others don't see that as the role of the
courts.
   A jury ``rules in favor of a plaintiff or defendant, but doesn't
rule on the issue involved,'' said Boris Yavitz, a Columbia
University business school professor with a chair in business
ethics.
   Consensus on rules of a society should be reached first through
public debate and the actions of elected officials, and the courts
should then enforce compliance with what is decided, in Yavitz'
view.
   But the courts have often been put to good use for important
causes, said John F. Banzhaf, a George Washington University law
professor and anti-smoking activist.
   Environmental protection and rights for minorities, prisoners
and women have been won and maintained in courtrooms, he said.
   Cigarette liability trials, with an individual victim and
testimony from bereaved family members, take the impersonal face
away from statistics about smoking's casualties, he adds.
   A momentous verdict, like in the Cipollone case, grabs the
attention of legislators. And an anti-industry verdict will spawn
more filings, spreading the industry's legal resources thin and
creating more opportunity for errors by industry lawyers, Banzhaf
contended.

   The mounties, a boa constrictor and five women
with shaved heads, at least one with a tattoo on her scalp, rode
out a drama over the weekend that ranged across Oregon and
Washington and ended up in a British Columbia jail.
   It began Friday night, police said, when the five abducted a
16-year-old girl from a party in Portland, Ore., forcing her into
her own car. The girl was tied up, beaten repeatedly and threatened
before being pushed out on Interstate 5 about 50 miles north of
Seattle.
   The women drove off with the car and the girl's pet boa
constrictor, police said.
   The teen-ager, thrown into a ditch and still tied up, managed to
crawl to the edge of the highway, where she was discovered by a
passer-by and taken to the hospital, said Elliott Woodall,
spokesman for the Snohomish County sheriff's department. She was
treated for multiple bruises and released to her mother Saturday
afternoon, a nursing supervisor said.
   Late Saturday, the car was spotted speeding by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police in Golden, British Columbia, about 200
miles north of the U.S. border. Officers stopped it, discovered it
was stolen and arrested the three women inside. The whereabouts of
the other two suspects were not known.
   The snake was recovered unharmed and was being looked after by
the mounties, Woodall said.
   A woman described by the victim as having an English accent and
a tattoo on the back of her shaved head that read, ``East Side
Chelseas,'' was among those arrested, he said. Canadian authorities
said she was a Calgary, Alberta, resident and that the other two
women taken into custody were U.S. residents whose addresses were
not immediately known.
   Robbery was the apparent motive for the abduction and attack,
Woodall said.

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will allow two hospitals
to open test-tube baby clinics, but only married couples can take
advantage of the procedure, officials said Sunday.
   In 1985, Saudi Arabia became the first Arab nation to open an
in-vitro fertilization clinic after Moslem theologians ruled the
procedure permissible, provided it involved the sperm and egg of a
married couple.
   The government in Bahrain plans to help establish two clinics
but will ban embryo banks and any fertilizations involving sperm
from anonymous donors.
   Kenneth A. Wordsworth, spokesman for International Hospital of
Bahrain, said officials hope to establish a clinic at the hospital
early next year. A spokesman for the Bahrain Defense Force Hospital
said that it had plans to open a clinic in two months.
   Babies conceived through in-vitro fertilization are commonly
called test-tube babies because the mother's egg is removed from
her body, fertilized in a laboratory dish and then reimplanted in
the womb.

   Under the slogan ``Let Toronto Shine,'' civic
leaders and summit organizers launched a clean-up campaign of what
is already one of the cleanest cities of North America.
   But some of their efforts backfired.
   Faster than crews of industrious workmen could spray and scrape
graffiti off some 200 buildings, groups of university vigilantes
were spray-painting the surfaces with fresh wall writings.
   ``Cancel the Summit, Cancel the Clean-Up,'' read one gaudily
painted protest in northeast Toronto, the work of a political
science major at the University of Toronto.
   ``This city has more graffiti now than ever before _ not that
they had very much at all,'' said the student, who would only
identify himself as John. ``If they hadn't called attention to this
with their clean-up, no one would have noticed this graffiti.''
   But the rest of the $48,000 summit spruce-up was received with
approval by local residents.
   Enterprising residents took advantage of a clean-up hotline set
up by the city to rid their yards and basements of debris. All they
had to do was call the hot line and complain of an unseemly blemish
on the summit landscape, such as left-over cement or a garbage heap
in their front yard, and a clean-up crew would show up and cart
away the offending items _ gratis.
   ``Many people just used the opportunity to get rid of things
they didn't want. People figured it's free, why not?'' said Carlo
Deriva, a taxi driver who took advantage of the service.

   One of the most eager summit participants is Amik, a
two-year-old beaver who has drawn more media attention than most
heads of state.
   The reason: he is on display in Summit Square, an enclosed area
where officials from the eight summit delegations and the estimated
3,000 journalists covering the events can eat and drink for free.
   By day, Amik swims around in a small pool, munching contently on
carrots and corn. At night, he checks into a luxury hotel for a
long soak in the tub of his handler, Julie Perreten.
   ``He's never been away on his own and he would have been very
stressed without me,'' she said. The home of the 30-pound mammal is
at the Science Center in Sudbury, Ontario, about 300 miles north of
here.
   ``He loves it here. He's getting a lot of attention,'' she added.
   The beaver, Canada's national animal, reaches maturity at the
age of 4. Amik will grow to weigh about 60 pounds, said Miss
Perreten.

   For those summit leaders who get bored poring over briefing
papers at night, a Toronto strip joint is offering an alternative:
a free performance by exotic dancers.
   ``If they can prove they're a head of state, they get a free
table and a girl to dance on it,'' said Ted Cody, who works at the
club called Filmore's.
   Filmore's is next door to the headquarters of the joint summit
security task force. ``The neighborhood is crawling with police,''
Cody said, ``and it's not even a raid.''

   A local drug store chain also is cashing in on the summit, which
city leaders hope will enhance Toronto's chances to host the 1996
Summer Olympics and the year 2000's World Fair.
   ``Who would you rather follow home this week? Maggie, Francois,
Helmut or Nobi,'' the radio commercial says.
   Shoppers can sign up to win a free trip to the country of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois
Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, or even to the far off
Land of the Rising Sun, whose leader, Noboru Takeshita, is one of

   Results were hard and fast in the National
Concrete Canoe Race finals at Lake Lansing.
   The canoes were made by engineering students from mixtures of
concrete and glue.
   The University of California at Berkeley team won the event
Saturday, which emphasized design principles, canoe maneuverability
and speed in the water. The 15 teams from universities nationwide
also were judged on design papers and formal presentations about
their project.
   Dense concrete was needed to keep water from seeping into the
canoe. Some vessels were only a quarter-inch thick but weighed more
than 100 pounds. Flotation foam was allowed in the bow and stern of
the canoes. The races were up to 600 meters long.
   The canoes demonstrated the versatility of the material, said
Edd Parker of Master Builders, which sponsored the event.
   ``You walk on it every day,'' he said. ``The only thing some
people feel about concrete is that it cracks and looks ugly.
   ``It can be molded in any number of forms and designed to fit
any need,'' Parker said. ``It's a simple material that can be
complex in its uses.''
   Cal-Berkeley defeated teams from the University of New
Hampshire, the University of Akron, Portland State University and
the University of Alabama at Huntsville.
   The winners received $5,000 for Cal-Berkeley's undergraduate
civil engineering program.

   Gov. Henry Bellmon took the first bite of
the famed Okmulgee pecan pie and summed it up in six words.
   ``It's very big, and very good,'' he said at the city's festival
Saturday.
   And while Bellmon arguably could be called biased in his
opinion, this was no ordinary pie. It measured 24 feet in diameter,
weighed 13,000 pounds and contained more than 1,100 pounds of
pecans.
   ``We used the same recipe that we've used for the past two
years,'' said Glenn Shoaf, baking instructor at the Oklahoma State
University Technical Branch who supervised about 100 student
volunteers in baking the pie.
   ``We took it from a smaller scale, put it on a computer and just
increased the ingredients as much as we needed,'' Shoaf said.
   Okmulgee has been swapping win-lost records for pecan pie sizes
with folks in Georgia for several years. Their latest pie appears
to outdo a recent 22-foot effort presented by the Sunbelt
Agricultural Exposition in Moultrie, Ga.
   ``I understand (Georgia) is talking peanuts,'' Shoaf said,
referring to a switch festival organizers have made in their pie's
main ingredient. ``We'll go after them again, if necessary.''

   Hogs, dogs, kids, cats, cows,
coyotes, the weather _ you name it. If it can be hollered at, it
was at the 20th Annual National Hollerin' Contest here.
   A crowd of about 5,000 sat sweltering in Saturday's steamy heat
to watch the contestants turn red in the face and risk an aneurysm
in pursuit of the title of champion hollerer.
   Shawn Kent, 8, won the junior competition in a runoff by calling
coyotes and crows.
   ``Aaaaaaaawk! Aaaaaawk!'' the bespectacled youngster cawed,
cupping his hands around his mouth. ``Det, det, det, whoooo-ah,
whoooo-ah, wak!''
   Shawn, who recently moved to nearby Sanford from Vancouver,
British Columbia, said later he didn't have a hollerin' repertoire
planned when he got up on the stage in this juncture in the road 40
miles south of Raleigh.
   ``My dad kept telling me things to do on stage, but I thought
they were stupid, so I just thought of the things I used to hear in
Canada and came up with coyotes,'' he said, grinning widely and
brandishing his trophy.
   Glenn Bolick of Lenoir took home the grand prize in the men's
competition. Bolick, wearing coveralls and a train engineer's cap,
said he thought he won because of his hog-calling lineage.
   ``I'm a fifth-generation hollerer. My grandparents did this for
years,'' he said. ``I didn't really expect to win, though. ... I'm
excited to death.''
   Ann Lorek of Castle Hayne won the women's category with her hen
and rooster calls, while Spivey's Corner native Brenda Carroll
Wrench pulled down a third-place ribbon by showing folks how she
called her dog, Fatty Bread, home.
   ``Whooo-op, whooo-op, here Fatty Bread, here Fatty Bread,
whooo-op,'' she called. ``Goot, goot, goot, goot.''
   Mrs. Wrench said she was surprised she did well since she was so
scared.
   ``I did it because of my son. He said if I got up on stage to
holler, he'd put his head in a hole,'' she said. ``I said, Start
digging, son.'''

<HEAD>Thousands of Journalists Gather for `Non-Event'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of journalists brushed up on
international economics, pored over the words of world leaders and
searched Sunday for a new angle on what has become an old story _
the annual economic summit of industrialized democracies.
   ``With the possible exception of royal visits, economic summits
are the most over-covered non-events on the media calendar,'' wrote
columnist Jeffrey Simpson in the Toronto Globe and Mail.
   Bob Asman, executive producer of NBC News, said the summits
``have become so institutionalized'' that they tend ``to be routine
and routine things aren't news.''
   Moreover, this year's gathering is expected to be low key.
   President Reagan, one of the seven world leaders at the meeting,
is a lame-duck with only seven months remaining in his term.
   In addition, the world economy is showing few trouble signs.
   Only a possible dispute over the unglamorous question of
agricultural subsidies threatens to mar the event. The United
States has proposed eliminating all agricultural subsidies by the
year 2000, a suggestion that has raised the ire of Europeans whose
farmers are heavily subsidized.
   Yet, summit organizers say nearly 3,000 reporters, editors,
technicians, producers, cameramen and others falling into the
``media'' category have been accredited to the gathering.
   Canadian reporters keeping tabs on their country's performance
as host of the 14th meeting account for about half the media crowd,
according to summit spokeswoman Joan Walters.
   The United States has sent about 400 journalists, and Japan, 212.
   In all, some four-dozen countries are represented by journalists
working at computer terminals, typewriters and sound booths
spanning the length of 2{ football fields in the Metropolitan
Toronto Convention Center.
   Why the media crush?
   ``We expect the amount of real hard news to be minimal but you
never can tell,'' said Asman. ``When the leaders of the Free World
nations gather, you must be prepared to cover.''
   Jeff Goldman, associate producer of PBS' MacNeil-Lehrer News
Hour, agreed, saying, ``You can't ignore it, certainly.''
   But does he expect much news from the event? ``I don't think
so,'' he replied, laughing. ``I think it's going to be more
ceremonial than substantive this time.''
   But for Susan Zirinsky, senior producer for CBS News and a
veteran of about a half-dozen summits, the gatherings are never
boring.
   ``They take on a life of their own. ... It's the nature of the
beast,'' she said. ``I don't think I've ever been to a summit that
I can say was dull. There's always something,'' she said.
   But some news organizations have scaled down their coverage
compared to past gatherings, which rotate among the United States,
France, Italy, Japan, Canada, Great Britain and Germany.
   ``The size of the effort here is smaller than it has been in
other summits,'' said Michael G. Duffy, senior producer for special
events of ABC News.
   Coverage has been reduced, he said, because of the limited
amount of news expected from the summit.
   Moreover, he noted, it comes just weeks after the U.S.-Soviet
summit in Moscow, which attracted about 5,000 journalists.
   Unlike the Moscow summit, none of the principal anchormen for
the major U.S. television evening newscasts plans to broadcast his
program from Toronto.
   The networks will carry coverage of the summit in their news
programs but not to the extent of the historic meeting between
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. That reunion prompted
widespread coverage of the Soviet Union, a country still seen as a
threat and an enigma by many Americans.
   Duffy said the more limited coverage of the Toronto gathering
gives news organizations ``an opportunity to cover the economic
summit a little more economically.''
   Ms. Zirinsky described CBS' effort as ``money conscious.''
   Japanese journalists, though, appear to be pulling out all the
stops.
   Hidetoshi Fujisawa, a Washington correspondent for the leading
Japanese TV network NHK, described their reporting as ``very, very
heavy ... maybe the biggest coverage among broadcasters.''
   Japanese viewers, he said, are interested in learning how their
country is perceived by the other leaders because of criticism in
recent years of the nation's enormous trade surplus.
   ``How Japan is seen in this summit,'' he said, ``is very, very
important.''
   ``We cover much heavier than the United States ... because we
have the hours to cover (and) Japanese people are very interested
in international affairs,'' he said.
   But to Simpson, whose column ran in Saturday's editions of the
Globe and Mail, ``Summits represent the classic manifestation of a
sensible idea gone wild. ... Put simply, the media attention stands
in inverse relation to the event's importance.''

<DATELINE>KURUKSHETRA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb planted by Sikh extremists
exploded Sunday in a crowd of people gathered outside an
electronics shop to watch a popular Hindu epic on television,
police said. Fifteen people died and 25 were wounded.
   The bomb was hidden in a cloth bag and left among the mainly
poor Hindu laborers who were watching the program. Officers said
the bomb apparently was detonated by remote control.
   Shortly after the bombing in Kurukshetra in Haryana state, Sikh
radicals assassinated the head of a militant Hindu group in
neighboring Punjab state. The Hindu leader's bodyguard and an aide
also were killed.
   In other violence in Punjab, Sikh extremists shot and killed
three police officers late Saturday, police said. They also were
blamed for the death Sunday of a Sikh farmer in central Punjab.
   A full alert was ordered in six states and in New Delhi, India's
capital.
   The bomb exploded a few minutes after the start of ``Ramayana,''
a popular weekly television serial. The story recounts adventures
of the Hindu god Lord Rama, and some radical Sikhs had warned
people not to watch it.
   Sikhs are a religious minority in India and claim discrimination
by the majority Hindus.
   ``I had come to the market to buy food and then I realized it
was time for `Ramayana,''' said Ram Pal, a 42-year-old civil
servant, from his hospital bed.
   ``I stopped outside the television shop. Suddenly there was an
explosion. I was hurled off my feet,'' said Pal, whose left arm was
cut by shrapnel.
   The blast shattered glass cases inside the shop and started a
stampede among the 150 people near the store.
   Blood and pieces of bodies covered the lane outside the shop.
   Police said bodies of 11 people could not be identified. Four
others died on their way to a hospital.
   Police blamed the bombing on Sikh extremists. They said the
explosive was left outside the shop.
   Authorities closed roads around the city of 500,000, about 90
miles north of New Delhi, but reported no arrests.
   It was the second bombing attack by Sikh extremists outside
Punjab in less than a month.
   On May 20, a series of bombs exploded in several buses in
Himachal Pradesh state. At least 10 people died.
   In Punjab, Rama Kant Jalota, president of a group to protect
Hindus and their religion, was assassinated by Sikh radicals who
overtook his car on a highway and opened fire, police said.
   Jalota's bodyguard and an accountant in the group also were
killed, the police said. Another bodyguard was reported in serious
condition and two bystanders were injured, police said.
   There were no details on the other slayings in Punjab.
   Hindu militants called for a general strike Monday in Punjab to
protest the slayings.
   The killings raised to more than 1,325 the number of people
killed in Punjab by Sikh extremists since Jan. 1. Militants have
been blamed for at least 42 more deaths in adjoining Himachal
Pradesh and Haryana states.
   The Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982.
   Sikhs' religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam.
   Most of the extremists' victims have been Hindus or moderate
Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but are a majority in Punjab.

   A 20-year-old Virginia man was stabbed to
death and two teen-agers suffered knife wounds when violence
erupted at a dance concert at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, police
said Sunday.
   Sean Shorts, 20, of suburban Alexandria, died from stab wounds
at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Washington Hospital Center, District of
Columbia detective Norman Brooks said.
   One teen-ager was admitted to another hospital with a stab wound
to the chest. He was listed in good condition Sunday. Another youth
was released after treatment for a superficial cut.
   Police estimated 4,000 people attended the Out of School Boogie
Concert given by a group called Rare Essence, which plays go-go, a
form of dance music popular with teen-agers in the nation's capital.
   Fighting erupted at about 7:45 p.m., just 15 minutes before the
concert was scheduled to end. The concert, which included eight
bands, began early in the afternoon.
   Police said they were not sure if the stabbings were related.

<HEAD>Politics, Capitol Hill Ill Will Work Against House Speaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A combination of national politics and Capitol
Hill ill will ensures that House Speaker Jim Wright won't soon
shake the ethics allegations against him even if he proves his
claim that he violated no rules.
   Wright wants the House ethics committee, which announced it is
examining six possible violations of House rules by the Texas
Democrat, to quickly dispose of the case.
   But the committee is under pressure from Republicans to hire
outside counsel _ even though it is the only panel in the House
where Republicans hold the same number of votes as Democrats.
   Sources familiar with the panel's thinking say the case against
Wright is not considered strong, but members are determined to
avoid charges of a ``whitewash.'' If an outside counsel is brought
in, the earliest a finding could be made would be September, said
one source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Even without an outside counsel, at the minimum, Wright will
remain under a cloud until after the Democratic National Convention
next month in Atlanta, where Wright is scheduled to serve as
chairman.
   And many Republicans have made it clear they won't accept a
finding of ``innocent'' if it comes, because it was the Democrats
who wrote the current House rules and the loopholes that Wright has
taken advantage of.
   ``Power corrupts, in my estimation, and they (the Democrats) are
corrupt,'' said Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev., chairman of the
Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives that
this week called for an outside counsel.
   Although Wright might proclaim he didn't violate any rules, she
said, ``if he doesn't think it's unethical, I think he needs a
course in ethics.''
   ``I don't think this blows over until after the (November)
general election,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., citing the GOP
need to use Wright to counter the charges of sleaze against the
Reagan administration.
   House Democrats have long made hay of the administration's
ethical lapses, with the House civil service subcommittee compiling
a list of 242 officials implicated through March 30. Some have been
cleared, but many have been convicted or resigned.
   As a result, Republicans need to smear Wright as much as
possible, Anthony said. ``Outside of nailing the speaker's hide on
the wall, they're not going to be satisfied with anything,'' he
said.
   However, there is division among Republican ranks over how far
that campaign should go.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., whose complaint launched the ethics
probe against the speaker, and others of the far right wing of the
party have included attacks on the backgrounds of some of Wright's
employees.
   The speaker's top legislative aide, John Mack, served two years
in prison after pleading guilty 15 years ago to malicious wounding.
Wright hired Mack, now 34, as a clerk at the urging of the
speaker's daughter, after Mack was put on a work release program.
Mack is Wright's daughter's brother-in-law.
   Also named in the attacks by Republicans was a press aide and
speech writer for Wright, George Mair, who once published a
collection of excerpts from sex books.
   Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan, recently sent
Wright a letter, with copies to the press, calling for the speaker
to fire the two men. ``Mr. Speaker, your office is the epitome of
sleaze!'' the letter concluded.
   Johanna Schneider, spokeswoman for House Republican leader Bob
Michel of Illinois, said the attacks on Wright's staff were coming
from ``a tiny segment.''
   Mack, she said, was well liked and ``I don't think anybody wants
to make an issue of that at all.'' But she said House Republicans
are united in their impatience with Wright's legislative tactics,
which the speaker himself concedes are heavy handed.
   The ethics case against Wright, timed to coincide with the
presidential election campaign, gives House Republicans the
opportunity to air their beefs nationally.
   ``It puts a focal point on the fact that the Democrats control
the House and they're doing a lousy job of it,'' says Steve
Lotterer, spokesman for the Republican National Congressional
Committee, which supports GOP House campaigns. GOP challengers will
point out that Democratic House incumbents voted for Wright for
speaker.
   ``Jim Wright is going to have a great deal of visibility as
chairman of the convention,'' he said. ``It think it has risen to
the point where people on Main Street know that Jim Wright has been
engaged in some very questionable activities.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic
presidential nominee, apparently has not yet asked Wright to step
aside.
   ``I thought there was a presumption of innocence in this
country,'' he said last week when asked about the case.
   The ethics committee has said publicly it is looking at a half
dozen accusations.
   Those include whether Wright is accused of improperly lobbying
federal and foreign officials on behalf of Texas oil companies with
which he might have had a financial relationship. The panel is also
looking at whether he used undue pressure on federal authorities on
behalf of Texas banks.
   Wright's use of a friend's Fort Worth condominium as his home
while paying for the days he stayed there, but no monthly rent, is
also under scrutiny.
   But it's the speaker's book deal that's received the most
publicity.
   Wright in 1984 had a collection of his remarks and writings
printed by a Texas friend who had also done more than half a
million dollars of work on Wright's campaigns.
   The deal gave Wright 55 percent of the royalties from the $5.95
paperback when it wasn't sold through bookstores _ which accounts
for most of the sales from the 20,000 copies.
   The arrangement gave Wright $55,000 in extra income beyond the
regular limits in the House rules, because book royalties are
exempt. Many of the books were sold in bulk to political supporters
of the speaker, raising questions as to whether the book was merely
a vehicle to steer around the limits that apply to speech honoraria
and other methods of giving Wright money.
   While Democrats concede the rules may need to be tightened,
there appears to be a rising anger at the Republican attacks on the
speaker.
   ``There are House Democrats who really believe this is wholesale
partisanship of the worst variety, and they are genuinely angry at
Gingrich and those who support him,'' Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.,
said, adding that he expects to see ``attempts at retribution.''
   Wright himself has said he feels toward Gingrich as ``a fire
hydrant feels toward a dog.''
   Republicans say Wright's power may also be responsible for the
lack of defection by Democrats.
   ``You don't want to be the one two years from now who didn't
stand by the speaker, if the speaker survives until then,''
Schneider said.

   A 57-year-old Georgia man who was
jailed when his visa expired went into a rage Sunday and beat up at
least 10 of his fellow inmates, three of whom had to be
hospitalized, officials said.
   Franklin Coleman, a former U.S. Air Force lieutenant, was being
treated for burns he suffered when he allegedly started a fire in
his cell after beating his fellow inmates, authorities said.
   Coleman had been held in a detention center for three days when
he began shouting complaints Sunday about his living conditions and
the slow disposition of his case, immigration officials said.
   They said Coleman was subdued and handcuffed by guards and other
inmates after he tore off his shirt and smashed windows with his
fists.
   But the 6-foot-2, 198-pound Franklin broke the chain of the
handcuffs and began thrashing his fellow inmates, officials said.
   Immigration authorities said seven inmates suffered minor
bruises and three others had to be rushed to a hospital for
treatment. Coleman suffered several cuts on his hands, they said.
   Immigration officials subsequently transferred Coleman's
cellmates to the commission's main office building.
   Later in the day, authorities said Coleman was burned when he
set fire to the cell's mattresses and blankets. Arson investigator
Sgt. Rogelio Elorta said Coleman suffered second-degree burns and
smoke inhalation and had to be revived with oxygen by firefighters.
   Guards at the Commission on Immigration and Deportation's
detention center said they did not know Franklin's hometown. The
detention center houses foreigners facing deportation for various
offenses.

   Soviet Armenia has been closed to foreign
journalists since ethnic unrest erupted there and in neighboring
Azerbaijan in February. Free-lance reporter Paul Hofheinz, an
American, was able to travel through the region last week and filed
this report.

<TEXT>
   A storm blew through Leninakan in
Soviet Armenia on a Monday evening, briefly dispersing the throngs
of people who had gathered in Theater Square in the city center.
   Local estimates put the crowd, which easily filled the
tree-lined square, at 50,000. Certainly there were many thousands.
   On an ordinary night, a few old men would have collected at the
heart of the 2,400-year-old city to play checkers and drink the
famed local cognac. But this night was different.
   It was June 13, the first day of a general strike to press
demands for resolution of a territorial dispute. Groups of
Armenians wandered up and down Kalinin Street, dropped by Theater
Square to hear speeches and mingled with friends.
   The city's center was closed to traffic. Several hundred
policemen were on hand to maintain order. They listened to the
proceedings and politely directed motorists to side streets.
   Since late May, crowds had gathered nightly on Theater Square
and in many Armenian cities to protest the 15-year prison term
given an Azerbaijani convicted of killing Armenians in ethnic
riots. Armenians didn't think the sentence was harsh enough.
   At least 32 people, most of them Armenians, died in three days
of rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.
   The strike was called by the Karabakh Committee, a group that
coordinates Armenia's popular protests. Protesters seek annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-dominated region that has been
attached to the republic of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   The stoppage was nearly total in Leninakan, a city of more than
170,000. A torrential downpour interrupted the flow of speeches in
Theater Square, but only briefly. Within 15 minutes, speakers
resumed calls for aid to the victims of the Sumgait riots and urged
unification of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.
   Placards included official portraits of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are one!'' proclaimed one red
banner in Armenian script.
   ``We're very angry that people in Moscow are saying we're
hooligans,'' said Tigran, a social worker, who had not been to work
that day. He and others interviewed requested only their first
names be used.
   ``Why don't they show this on television?'' he asked. ``We're
very peaceful people ... If they'd just give us Nagorno-Karabach,
they wouldn't hear another word from us.''
   Workers, factory managers, athletes, Sumgait refugees and others
addressed the crowd.
   ``It is important that we stay organized,'' a man named Gevork,
who identified himself as a manager of a local factory, told the
crowd.
   ``We must do everything we can to help the victims of the
massacre at Sumgait!'' he said. The audience applauded, but a
heckler shouted ``Why don't you make one of your dachas available
to them?''
   Those close enough to hear laughed. A dacha is a summer home.
   Official figures published Wednesday in the Armenian newspaper
Kommunist say 2,527 Armenians have been resettled after leaving
Sumgait. The Communist Party first secretary in Armenia, S.G.
Arutunyan, told the republic's Supreme Soviet that 86 families are
still homeless.
   The general strike nearly shut down Leninakan for three days,
despite official appeals for people to return to work.
   But authorities acted to protect the demonstrators.
   When a few dozen protesters set out on foot for Yerevan, the
Armenian capital 40 miles away, police provided an official escort.
   Elsewhere, some office workers took advantage of the general
strike to go into the mountains for a picnic.
   ``In Armenia, the cognac flows in rivers,'' explained Viken, a
fireman who was roasting a slaughtered lamb over an open fire with
friends. ``You dip your bottle in, and fill it up.''
   But when talk turned to Nagorno-Karabakh, the picnickers grew
serious. ``Azerbaijanis are Turks!'' said Levon, a local party
official. ``They're Muslims, and we're Christians. We've been
fighting each other for centuries. Stalin was wrong to put
Nagorno-Karabach under their control.''
   Josef Stalin was in charge of the nationalities policy when the
republics' boundaries were drawn.
   On Wednesday, news spread swiftly of the Armenian Supreme
Soviet's decision to petition Moscow to put Nagorno-Karabach under
Armenian control.
   ``This is very good news,'' said Agonye, a local bureaucrat.
``They wouldn't have taken a decision like that without Moscow's
approval.''
   Wednesday night, after the Armenian government announcement,
Theater Square was quiet. Hundreds of cigarette butts strewn across
the square were the only reminder of the recent days' events.
   But Friday, the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet announced it would
oppose any move to take away Nagorno-Karabakh. The dispute is not
over yet.

<HEAD>Pope Canonizes 117 Saints Martyred in Vietnam In Largest Such
Ceremony</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II canonized 117 martyrs from
Vietnam on Sunday in an event that drew thousands of Vietnamese
refugees from around the world and irked that country's Communist
authorities.
   The Hanoi government had said that it wasn't against the
canonization _ the largest in Roman Catholic history _ but it
charged that Vietnamese emigrants seized on the occasion to make
anti-communist declarations.
   An estimated 8,000 Vietnamese, some of them ``boat people'' who
fled Vietnam since 1975, were among the 20,000 people who attended
the canonization Mass in St. Peter's Square.
   They later staged reunions in nearby restaurants or ate rice,
vegetables and grilled chicken from campers parked within the
Vatican's ancient walls.
   The pope said he felt ``profoundly and particularly close'' to
the estimated 3.5 million to 5.3 million Catholics in predominantly
Buddhist Vietnam.
   ``We can say that the blood of martyrs is for you, Christians of
Vietnam, a source of grace to progress in the faith,'' the pope
said during the noon Angelus prayer following the Mass.
   The Vietnamese were enthusiastic but orderly, joining in the
celebration without any apparent display of political sentiment.
   ``It's very special, it's great,'' said Tuan Nguyen, 14, who
left Vietnam eight years ago and now lives in Kristiansand, Norway.
A chartered bus brought him and two brothers, a sister and his
mother to the Vatican. Charters brought many of the Vietnamese from
their new homelands.
   Among those made saints were eight bishops, 50 priests and 59
lay people, including the mother of six children.
   The 96 native Vietnamese, 11 Spanish and 10 Frenchmen were
killed for their faith in the Southeast Asian land in the 18th and
19th centuries.
   Radio Hanoi, Vietnam's state radio, reported Thursday that a
Vietnamese bishop told Roman Catholics in his diocese not to
celebrate the canonization of the martyrs after officials told him
they were displeased with the ceremony.
   It said Bishop Huynh Dong Cat wrote a letter to priests and lay
followers also noting that before the Communists defeated South
Vietnam and reunited the country in 1975, June 19 had been a day
that honored the South Vietnamese army.
   The Vatican has said the date was a coincidence.
   Since the 1975 Communist victory, the Vatican has had no formal
ties with Vietnam.
   The Communist authorities had taken steps toward reconciliation
with the country's Christian minorities until announcement of the
planned canonization strained informal relations.
   The pope, who spoke briefly in Vietnamese to welcome the crowd,
alluded to the problems of the church in Vietnam and the delicacy
of its relations with the government.
   During the noon prayer, the pope spoke of a sanctuary to the
Virgin Mary of La-vang, which was burned during Christian
prosecution in the 19th century, rebuilt in 1901, and reduced to
rubble during this century's battles.
   ``Nevertheless, pilgrims today still gather around it, despite
difficulties, to pray to invigorate their faith,'' the pope said.
   After saying he hoped that the sanctuary would be rebuilt soon
``in a spirit of freedom and peace,'' the pope expressed a wish for
``national unity, as well as the true civil and moral progress of
the country.''
   The Vatican said 130,000 Vietnamese have died for their faith
since Christianity arrived in the late 16th century.
   In 1954, hundreds of thousands of Catholics fled south after the
country was divided into a non-communist South and communist North.
   ``The Vietnamese church, with its martyrs and by means of its
testimony, has been able to proclaim its will and its commitment
not to reject the cultural tradition and the legal institutions of
the country,'' the pope said in his homily, which was delivered in
French and Spanish.
   ``On the contrary, it has declared and demonstated that it wants
to incorporate it in itself, contributing with faithfulness to the
genuine building of the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Civilians Captured on Wake Island During WW II Get Memorial _ 47
Years Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WAKE ISLAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heroic, 16-day defense of this coral
atoll in December 1941 by a small force of soldiers and civilians
inspired a United States suddenly plunged into war.
   ``Remember Wake Island'' became a rallying cry for a nation
wounded by Pearl Harbor.
   After nearly four years in Japanese prison camps, the military
survivors came home to ticker-tape parades. Almost as soon as the
war ended, a memorial to the 449 Marine defenders was erected on
Wake.
   But it took 47 years for the government to memorialize the
civilians who fought and died with the military and desperately
staved off a Japanese invasion that began hours after the attack on
Pearl Harbor, 2,200 miles to the east.
   On Thursday, 42 civilian and 14 military defenders and more than
100 others gathered here for the dedication of a monument to the
civilians. The rectangular monument of dark marble consists of
engravings of heavy equipment and a plaque that tells the story of
the civilians.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., whose father was among the
captured and imprisoned civilian workers, read congratulatory
letters from President Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   Packard, who for the last three years helped the survivors wage
their struggle for recognition, said, ``What they wanted seemed
pretty simple, but I must say the government threw up roadblock
after roadblock.''
   Seventy civilians died during the siege, more than 30 perished
in prison camps and 98 civilians kept on the island as slave
laborers were machine-gunned to death in retaliation for an
American air strike.
   The onslaught began Dec. 8, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor
occurred only hours before the assault on Wake, but Wake is west of
the International Dateline and it was a day later here.
   The siege ended 16 days later with the surrender of 523 military
personnel _ 449 Marines, 68 sailors and six Army Air Corps members
_ and 1,150 civilian workers on the three small islets known as
Wake Island.
   More than 1,000 Japanese died during the battle and 2,000 more
later perished of starvation or sickness. In 1957, Japan Air Lines
helped pay for a simple monument, a few hundred feet away from the
Marine memorial, asking that ``peace prevail on the waters of the
Pacific forever.''
   Throughout the years, the civilians were ignored.
   ``When we started asking for veterans' benefits, the government
wanted to know exactly what we did,'' said Walt Moser, 71, who
lives in Fremont, Calif. ``Sure the military guys did the main
fighting, but we passed the ammunition and patrolled the beaches
and moved the anti-aircraft guns at night.
   ``We sandbagged and dug revetments and buried the dead. We
really did help. We weren't all just hiding out there under the
brush.''
   In 1981, 40 years after the siege, the civilians were deemed
eligible for veterans' benefits.
   For years, the sole memorial to the civilians on the island was
one they created themselves: a large coral boulder, painstakingly
hand-carved in May 1943 with the initials of the 98 men left as
slave labor on Wake after their comrades became POWs in Japan and
Shanghai. Five months later, the 98 were massacred.
   In 1985, a group of civilian survivors returned to the island to
confront their memories, compare experiences and renew old
friendships. They were joined by about 40 soldiers who had also
surrendered here.
   ``We had 98 men out here who were butchered, and nobody cared,''
said Bill Taylor, a 71-year-old retired contractor from Provo,
Utah. ``There was nothing out here, nothing at all. It was really
an injustice.''
   The civilians asked for help from the Air Force, which maintains
the island mainly as a refueling stop. The Air Force gave them some
concrete, and the men poured a one-foot-square slab, stuck on a few
pieces of coral and inscribed ``Civilian Workers of Wake,
12-23-41.'' They left before the makeshift memorial was dry.
   ``It just really bothered me, and it kept bothering me,'' Taylor
said. ``I wanted to do something. But I knew we were just a bunch
of old guys with no clout, not that much money and not a whole lot
of organization.''
   Taylor then found Packard, whose father was a civilian helping
to build air strips and military facilities on Wake when he was
captured.
   ``I remember what it was like not knowing if our father was
alive or dead,'' said Packard, 57. ``Wake Island was a significant
part of our own family history, and I wanted to help these
survivors if I could.''
   Packard helped get the memorial approved and persuaded the Air
Force to help install and maintain it. The survivors paid the
$4,700 cost with help from Idaho-based Morrison Knudson
Construction Co., one of the main companies in the consortium of
firms that contracted for the construction work.
   The memorial stands between the one for the Marines and the one
for the Japanese.
   On Thursday, the Rev. Joe McDonald III, a Catholic priest and
the son of a civilian captured on Wake, asked the survivors to
forgive not only the Japanese but also the bureaucracy that
thwarted them for so long.

   About 50 youngsters from a fundamentalist
Christian boarding home shut down earlier this month are missing,
and officials blame Mississippi's exempting such homes from
licensing for the almost impossible task of finding the youths.
   ``We started out with an unknown number of children, and we're
still left with an unknown number of children,'' state Welfare
Commissioner Thomas Brittain said as Youth Court proceedings wound
down for the 72 children taken into custody from the Bethel Home
for Children in Lucedale.
   The home's operator, the Rev. Herman Fountain, refused to tell
state officials how many children he boarded, although the court
ordered him to provide a list. Fountain says the constitutional
separation of church and state exempts him from state regulation.
   ``You can't investigate in a reasonable manner unless you have
someone's name and something about where they came from and so
forth,'' Brittain said.
   Fountain told reporters that he had about 120 children living at
his 28-acre independent Baptist compound. With 72 in state custody,
that leaves about 50 unaccounted for.
   Youth Court Judge Robert Oswald ordered the state Welfare
Department on June 10 to take custody of the home's children,
ranging in age from 10 to 17. Oswald ruled they were subjected to
``physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to
imprisonment.''
   Most of the children taken into custody were found roaming the
streets of Lucedale. They reportedly were told to flee the home
minutes after Oswald's order and before state welfare officials
arrived.
   About 50 of those taken into custody were returned to their
parents, who in most cases were required to sign an agreement that
they wouldn't be returned to Bethel, Brittain said.
   Parents of 13 of the children were refused custody because of
reports of child abuse before their children came to Bethel, he
said.
   Many supporters claim action was taken against Bethel to
pressure the Legislature into passing licensing laws.
   Brittain denies that. ``Absolutely not. We went into Bethel
because we had repeated reports of runaways and abuse.
   ``If this in fact helps lead to licensure, we'd be happy about
it.''
   Mississippi is among six states which exempt religious boarding
homes from licensing, said Jake Terpstra, licensing specialist with
the U.S. Children's Bureau of the Department of Health and Human
Services in Washington.
   Others are Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Missouri, he said, adding that Florida requires registration, but
not licensing.
   About 20 unlicensed religious homes are discovered around the
nation each year in the 44 states requiring licensing, said Betsy
Rosenbaum, project manager of the Washington-based American Public
Welfare Association, a national organization of child welfare
administrators and agencies.
   ``Most states have had to deal with this,'' Terpstra said of the
oversight problem.
   Every state supreme court that has considered the issue has
ruled in the state's favor, Terpstra said.
   Nela Hughes, licensing specialist for Mississippi, says there
are 28 licensed residential child-care facilities in the state. She
estimates there are at least that same number of unlicensed
facilities.
   Some of the unlicensed facilities could be non-religious, she
said, because there is no penalty for failing to comply with
licensing regulations.
   Licensed child-care facilities must provide information about
administrators and the children in their custody and must have
written discipline and punishment policies, she said.
   ``This department does not recommend corporal punishment, but
there is no way we can prohibit it,'' she said, adding the law
forbids ``cruel and inhumane punishment.''
   Brittain said the Welfare Department has lobbied for licensing
reform.
   Hattiesburg attorney Dan Wise, a Youth Court judge who heard a
similar case two years ago involving the now-defunct Bethesda Home
for Girls in Forrest County, this week blamed legislators.
   ``The members of the Legislature who have obstructed passage of
regulations of 24-hour child-care homes by their unwillingness to
face up to and deal with a serious problem have caused the state of
Mississippi and mainstream religious homes to suffer yet another
black eye,'' Wise said.
   Paul Nunnery, executive director of the Mississippi Baptist
Convention's Baptist Children's Village in Jackson, said his
facility has voluntarily submitted to state licensing even though
it is exempt.
   ``We are Southern Baptists and believe in the separation of
church and state. We have not found that state licensing of our
children's home has interfered in the least with the practice or
tenets of our faith,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brawling English Soccer Fans Leave Town</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of raucous English
soccer fans have left town after three nights of trashing taverns,
breaking windows and waging drunken street brawls with fans from
other countries, police said Sunday.
   Authorities in Munich, meanwhile, said a group of West Germans
who incited some of the violence were part of an organized gang
that travels to major events to cause trouble.
   More than 800 people were arrested in six West German cities
since the European soccer championships began on June 10.
   But officials said many of the English fans returned to Britain
after their team was eliminated with a 3-1 loss Saturday to the
Soviet Union.
   ``There are no rowdies in the streets. They've left the city,''
Frankfurt police spokesman Axel Dorff told The Associated Press.
The hard-core English troublemakers were estimated to number 300 to
400.
   British fans broke up taverns, attacked patrons and chanted
``God Save the Queen'' as they roamed through the streets of the
Sachsenhausen district and near the train station.
   English fans attacked two motorists stopped at red lights and
forced many city residents to stay away from areas where clashes
with fans of other teams were taking place.
   Intoxicated British and German soccer fans roamed the area near
the city's main train station overnight following the Soviet
Union's win.
   Drunken soccer fans started tearing up two bars at around
midnight, but police quickly arrived and restored peace, officials
said.
   ``Rowdies tore out a beer tap in one of the bars. The bartender
turned off the lights and called the police,'' said another
Frankfurt police spokesman, Kurt Kraus.
   Police picked up 76 British and 22 German rowdies overnight, but
most had been freed, Kraus said Sunday.
   About 200 people, most of them English, were arrested during
three nights of disturbances in Frankfurt.
   Earlier, the English fans had left behind a trail of arrests and
broken beer bottles in Stuttgart, Cologne and Duesseldorf. The body
of an Irish fan was fished from the Main River in Frankfurt on
Thursday night. Police said he apparently drowned while intoxicated.
   While most of the attention was focused on the English,
authorities also pointed the finger at West Germans, including 16
right-wing extremists arrested Saturday in Frankfurt.
   On Sunday, Munich police said an organized ``horde of several
hundred traveling thugs'' from three West German cities has also
been going from match to match instigating violence.
   ``These thugs seek out important events only for the purpose of
causing trouble,'' said Munich police spokesman Georg
Schratzenstaller.
   Schratzenstaller said the traveling groups of West German
troublemakers were mostly from Cologne, Nuremberg and Gelsenkirchen.
   A total of 120 rowdies were arrested in Munich on Friday, and
many belonged to that group, Schratzenstaller said.
   The next round in the European Soccer Championships is slated
for Tuesday in Hamburg. West Germany plays the Netherlands in a
semifinal match.
   The violence by English fans already has prompted England to
withdraw its application for readmission to European club soccer
tournaments next season.
   English clubs were banned after the 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy
in Belgium in which 39 people, most of them Italians, were killed
in violence sparked by English soccer fans.

<HEAD>Shultz: Nicaragua Is `Bad Apple' in Central American Barrel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Sunday
labeled Nicaragua a ``rotten apple in the barrel'' of emerging
Central American democracies and said neighboring countries must
help the United States ``get them into this fold.''
   Describing the Central American mission he will embark upon late
this month, Shultz said that ``I'm going to carry the U.S. message
of what our objectives are, and our program and ideas for getting
there.''
   In an interview on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press,'' the secretary
said that he thought the Reagan administration's doctrine of
pushing democracy, freedom and economic development in the region
had been mostly successful, and he cited changes in Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
   But when asked directly to name his No. 1 foreign policy
disappointment, Shultz pointed to the continuing rule of Nicaragua
by the Marxist Sandinista government headed by President Daniel
Ortega.
   ``In spite of the fact that we've made great strides there
(Central America), ... the fact is we still have this bad, rotten
apple in the barrel in the form of Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Shultz described the continuance in power of Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega as ``a gnawing problem,'' but predicted anew
that Noriega will not surmount pressure to step aside.
   The secretary of state refused to be drawn into lengthy
questioning about the administration's options for getting new
assistance to the Contra rebels, saying no decisions had been made
on that matter. Administration officials have acknowledged that it
would be very difficult to win congressional approval of direct
U.S. military aid to the rebels, notwithstanding the failure of the
Contra peace talks with the Sandinistas.
   The State Department announced on Saturday that Shultz would
travel to Central America on June 29-July 1 for talks on the
collapse of the peace negotiations. Veteran diplomat Max Kampelman,
who has been instrumental in U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, has
been holding talks in the region.
   Shultz maintained in the NBC interview that administration
policy in Central America has been largely successful.
   ``The odd man out is Nicaragua. It's the rotten apple in the
barrel,'' he said. ``And somehow or other, Nicaragua has got to be
brought into this fold. That's a problem, and we want to somehow,
through some combination of pressure that's generated internally to
Nicaragua ... to get them into the fold.''
   ``The situation in Nicaragua is really lousy, both from the
standpoint of the suppression, repression and from the standpoint
of the absolute terrible situation of their economy,'' Shultz said.

   Rock superstar Michael Jackson fulfilled a
childhood dream by visiting the widow of Charlie Chaplin at her
home in Switzerland during a break in his European concert tour, a
Swiss newspaper reported Sunday.
   The tabloid Sonntags Blick said Jackson visited Oona O'Neill
Chaplin on Friday at her home in Vevey, overlooking Lake Geneva. He
gave a concert Thursday night in Basel.
   The paper quoted Mrs. Chaplin as telling Jackson that he had ``a
lot in common with her husband'' because they were both born poor
and had to strive to achieve what they did.
   The paper said Jackson was a great admirer of Chaplin and that
he knew many details of the life of the silent-film comedian who
died in 1977.
   Sonntags Blick quoted Jackson as saying after the meeting, ``I
have just fulfilled my biggest childhood dream.''

   After completing a two-month, 1,581-mile trek
across the Greenland icecap, explorer Will Steger says he's
confident he and his team can cross Antarctica next year.
   ``Now I know we can do it,'' Steger said Saturday by telephone
from a lakeshore cabin in southern Quebec, where he and his five
crew members relaxed for the first time since leaving for Greenland
on April 13.
   The men and 30 sled dogs completed a south-north crossing of
Greenland _ which has been done only once before _ last week when
they reached the Humboldt Glacier. Most of the journey was
conducted without being resupplied with food or equipment.
   But the icecap expedition was just a warmup for a 5,000-mile
trip across Antarctica planned for 1989 and 1990.
   ``It was the same thing, day in and day out,'' Steger said.
``Sometimes the snow would be deeper, sometimes there'd be drifts,
but the terrain never varied at all.
   ``I knew it would be monotonous, and it didn't disappoint me.
Day after day after day. After a while it was kind of like a jail
term.''

   Oliver Stone of ``Platoon'' fame spoke
out for a veteran who served with him in Vietnam in the platoon
that was the basis of the director-writer's Academy-Award winning
movie.
   Stone told the Oklahoma parole board Saturday that Toby T.
Sanders, convicted of burglary, developed his drug habit in the
platoon where both saw duty and were wounded in 1967. Sanders was
awarded the Army Commendation Medal for Heroism.
   ``I'm either going to be in a penitentiary all my life or be
drug free,'' Sanders told the board.
   The board unanimously approved Sanders' parole request on
condition he seek drug counseling. Sanders has been serving a
10-year sentence since 1985 for burglary of a doctor's office.
   Stone said he has heard that other members of the platoon have
been jailed or are dead from car accidents or suicides.
   ``I hope the board shows some mercy (for Sanders) as a Vietnam
veteran for what he went through,'' Stone said.
   ``You country owes you for your service,'' board chairman Carl
Hamm told Sanders. ``But by the same token, you owe it to your
country to obey its laws and rules.''

   The Oak Ridge Boys country music group
and an ousted singer with the quartet are close to settling a $40
million lawsuit, the former member says.
   William Lee Golden, who was voted out of the award-winning group
a year ago, said an out-of-court settlement is being worked out.
   Wayne Halper, his lawyer, said Friday a settlement could come
within three-to-five days, but added, ``Sometimes these things take
longer.''
   Golden had been a member of the quartet for 22 years when the
other three ousted him in spring 1987 because of personal and
musical differences.
   He filed the suit for $30 million in punitive damages and $10
million in general damages.
   The Oak Ridge Boys are best known for their 2 million-selling
hit, ``Elvira,'' and ``Bobbie Sue,'' which sold 1 million records.

   Adrian Dantley of the Detroit Pistons said he
doesn't care who was on the other end of the phone, all he wanted
was his insoles.
   On Friday in Los Angeles, Dantley got the telephone call he'd
been waiting for since Game 5 of the National Basketball
Association championships against the Los Angeles Lakers.
   ``They guy just called and said, `I have your orthotics
(insoles),''' Dantley said. ```I'm going to the airport and mailing
them right now.'
   ``I don't know who he was and I didn't ask why he took them. I
was just happy.''
   The Piston forward said that after Thursday's game, which
Detroit won 104-94 to take a 3-2 lead in the series, someone came
into the Pistons' locker room and swiped Dantley's shoes and the
insoles, which he uses because one of his legs is longer than the
other. He issued a plea for the souvenir snatcher to keep the
sneakers, but send back the insoles.
   On Saturday, Dantley got a Federal Express package with his wish
_ the insoles and a note reading, ``Good luck. Sorry A.D.! Meant no
harm. Go Pistons!''
   ``Now the series can go on,'' Dantley said.
   The shoes were replaced.

   Frenchman Marc Fabre, primed in the frenzy of a
Parisian cafe, won the annual waiter's race on Sunday, crossing the
finish line with a bottle and three glasses still upright on his
tray after a five-mile hike around town.
   A Japanese waiter, Sakai Osamu, placed second, scurrying to the
finish ahead of about 500 other participants.
   The race, which started and ended at City Hall, took the servers
on a jaunt by some of Paris' landmarks, including Notre Dame and
the Paris Opera.
   The competitors were not timed.

<HEAD>Army Closes Three Schools, Rabin Meeting Palestinians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army Sunday closed three Arab schools where
student protests have erupted, and a spokesman for Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said Rabin had met with Palestinian leaders in an
effort to resolve the uprising.
   ``He's trying to create a dialogue, to ask what is happening and
about the future, what they suggest'' as solutions, spokesman Eitan
Haber said. He would not elaborate.
   Haber would not say where or when the meetings had taken place.
   The daily Haaretz reported that the defense minister recently
met with an author of the Palestinian National Charter, a platform
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The report did not name
the Palestinian or give the date of the meeting.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Rabin decided against publishing the names of the Palestinian
leaders who met him, fearing they could be assassinated.
   The decision followed the June 7 stabbing and wounding of the
Israeli-appointed mayor of the West Bank town of El Bireh, Hassan
Tawil.
   In a related development, Shaike Erez, a military governor for
the West Bank, met more than 30 Arab merchants in the city of
Ramallah to discuss ``ways of improving commerce'' following
repeated strikes in the Arab uprising, said Olivier Rafowicz, a
spokesman for the military government in the West Bank.
   Rafowicz described the talks as ``very good'' but refused to
elaborate.
   News of Rabin's meetings with local leaders in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip followed a weekend of violence in the
territories that Israel captured in the 1967 war.
   At least 210 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8.
   In the West Bank, army troops Sunday shot and wounded a
20-year-old Palestinian during disturbances in the village of Salem
near Nablus, a military spokesman said.
   The spokesman said Arab residents attacked a routine army patrol
``with rocks, slingshots and road blockades.'' An official at the
Ittihad hospital in Nablus said the man was hit in the left side of
the neck but was in fair condition.
   The army closed two schools in the West Bank and one in the Gaza
Strip on Sunday after student protests erupted, the military
government spokesmen said. The schools closed in the West Bank were
in Tubas and El Khader. A school in the Ein el Sultan refugee camp
near Jericho was closed last week.
   Rafowicz said they would be closed ``several days.''
   The refugee camp school in Ein el Sultan is run by the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency. In the camp, an 18-year-old was
shot to death by a civilian bus driver last week after young men
threw stones at the bus.
   Israel radio reported that the Tubas school was closed after
students came to school Sunday morning but refused to attend
classes and stood outside the building. Classes are normally held
Sunday.
   Soldiers also shut a U.N.-operated junior high school for girls
in the Gaza town of Bani Suheila following anti-Israeli
demonstrations on Saturday and several previous occasions, said a
spokesman for the Gaza military government. He said the school
would remain closed until the school year ends at the end of June.
   Arab schools in the West Bank and east Jerusalem were closed for
about four months by authorities who said they were staging grounds
for disturbances in the uprising.
   The schools reopened in late May and early June.
   Also Sunday, government leaders issued an appeal for Israelis to
help battle hundreds of fires that are being blamed on Arab
arsonists.
   Cabinet ministers at their weekly meeting appealed to Israelis
to ``help all bodies that deal with extinguishing and preventing
fires.'' Thousands of blazes have broken out since early May and
have destroyed more than 25,000 acres of trees and pasture land, a
government statement said.

   Cambodia's premier said anti-government
rebels are losing strength, and he pledged to resist their demands
for a new regime.
   However, Premier Hun Sen said in an interview seen Sunday in
Bangkok that the army faces a great challenge as Vietnam pulls out
its troops, which had bolstered his government.
   The official also played down fears of a takeover by Khmer Rouge
guerrillas, the strongest rebel force opposing the government that
Vietnam installed after invading in late 1978.
   Hun Sen's declarations came as his government, the three
guerrilla factions, Vietnam, and other nations prepared to attend
unprecedented peace talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, in July.
   The makeup of a new government was a key point of contention
that led to the break-off in previous talks between Hun Sen and
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the resistance coalition.
   Hun Sen made no reference to the Jakarta talks but said ``if a
political solution could be achieved, the main thing we must strive
for is to safeguard the gains of the revolution. We are not so
naive or venturesome as to seek a solution which might lead to the
abolishment of the regime and state of the People's Republic of
Kampuchea,'' or Cambodia.
   The premier was interviewed by Vietnam's ``All People's National
Review.'' A text was carried by an official Vietnam News Agency
report dated Saturday.
   On Vietnam's planned withdrawal of 50,000 troops this year, Hun
Sen said, ``No doubt this is a big trial for the Kampuchean army
and people.''
   But he said his forces were gaining strength faster than the
largest guerrilla force, the Khmer Rouge. Diplomats are skeptical
of that claim.
   ``We may liken the situation to a short-distance race between us
and the enemy,'' he said. ``We have outpaced them by 10 yards, and
as of now we continue to push on a higher speed. So how can they
overtake us?''
   Vietnam's pullout, starting this month, and its pledge to
totally withdraw by 1990 have renewed concern about the return of
the Chinese-backed communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of people and attacked the Vietnamese and Thai borders
before Hanoi ousted the group from Phnom Penh.
   Vietnam is believed to have already withdrawn some troops.
   Some diplomats say the Khmer Rouge has been avoiding direct
clashes to store arms and establish bases for an all-out offensive
in 1990.
   But Hun Sen said, ``In our view, the present low level of enemy
actions does not stem from, as others believe, their intention to
keep their force in waiting for the opportunity, but actually from
their dwindling strength.''

<HEAD>Americans Seek Reunion With Children In Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired accountant from San Diego who
spent eight years in Vietnam is among four Americans returning to
the country Monday to try to retrieve the children they left
behind, a sponsor of the effort said.
   The four have written their Amerasian children to tell them of
their planned arrival in Ho Chi Minh City, said Bruce Burns,
director of the California-based Amerasian Registry.
   Burns, whose organization aids such reunions, said the four hope
to leave with their children for Bangkok in a week, then return to
the United States.
   The Vietnamese government has been cooperating and the four are
awaiting approval from the Thai government and the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok, he said in an interview.
   Burns identified the four as Joseph Crotty of Redding, Calif.;
West Anderson of Poulsbo, Wash.; Verdun Andrus from San Diego; and
Nam Small, the Vietnamese-American wife of John Small of Westbrook,
Maine. She is trying to bring out the couple's son.
   Burns said Crotty, 62, a retired navy officer and former
California Highway Patrolman, left his pregnant girlfriend, Pham
Thi Tam, in Vietnam in August 1969. Their son, Khuc Thua Si, 18,
lives in Danang and was granted U.S. citizenship a few years ago.
   Burns said Anderson, 38, who works in a munition factory, spent
two years in the army in Vietnam. He brought his wife back to the
United States, but left behind their daughter, Nguyen Thi Lang, now
16.
   Andrus, 59, a retired accountant, spent eight years in Vietnam
working for a civilian architectural and engineering firm, Burns
said. He said Andrus has not seen his wife, Hoang Son Andrus, since
the communist victory in April 1975. She and their 14-year-old son,
Vo Thi Tham, live in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Mrs. Small's son, Nguyen Ngoc Linh, 16, lives in Can Thoc south
of Ho Chi Minh City. Burns said she has not seen him since 1974
when his medical examinations were not completed and she had to
leave to join her husband.
   John Small, 45, a postmaster, spent two years in the army in
Vietnam.

   By summer's end, this area of western Nevada
will be tapping its last available drops of water, and experts warn
there will be no reserve left if there's an unprecedented third
consecutive dry winter.
   ``The next couple of months are going to be spooky at least,''
federal Watermaster Garry Stone said Saturday.
   Irrigation ditches to farms and ranches will begin drying up
this month, and by August the Truckee River will be trickling
through Reno at one-tenth its current low rate, Stone said.
Reservoirs which also serve as recreational areas will be running
dry.
   ``The runoff is gone. We're not going to get any more storage
than we have today,'' Stone told a meeting of Associated
Press-affiliated radio and television reporters.
   With two weeks left in the July-June precipitation measuring
period, Western Nevada is on the verge of being the driest it's
ever been for that 12 months since records began at the end of the
Civil War, state Climatologist John James said.
   Western Nevada is dependent on the spring and summer meltoff
from winter's snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which also supplies
much of California's water reserve. But that snowpack was half of
normal this past winter for the second straight year, and Stone
said water reserves in Lake Tahoe and other reservoirs are near an
end.
   ``By the end of August, Lahontan will be empty. That will end
any irrigation below Lahontan,'' he said. ``The vast majority of
irrigation above Lahontan will end in the next three weeks.''
   Lahontan Reservoir, about 35 miles east of Reno, is a narrow,
20-mile-long lake in the heart of one of Nevada's few agricultural
areas and a prime destination for boating, swimming and fishing in
this arid region.
   Stone said the Truckee, which runs out of Lake Tahoe to supply
the Reno area, is flowing at just under 500 cubic feet per second.
By Oct. 1, that flow will be down to 50 cfs, Stone said.
   While Westpac Utilities, which supplies water to the Reno-Sparks
area, has first dibs on that dribble, Bob Firth, the utility's
manager for water resources, said the company will have to turn to
limited storage in Donner and Independence lakes just west of the
California-Nevada state line and to its wells.
   ``I think we'll make it through, but if we have a third winter
with less than 70 percent of our average snowfall, we'll have major
problems,'' he said.
   Stone said he expected to be able to maintain the current flow
in the Truckee River through the end of July, but it ``will drop
off dramatically after that.''
   By the first week in August, ``most of the irrigation ditches in
the Truckee Meadows will be off,'' he said.
   Lake Tahoe currently is just 1.55 feet above its natural rim.
When it falls below that federally mandated minimum level around
Oct. 1, Stone will have nothing left to tap for the Truckee
Meadows, which encompasses the Reno-Sparks area.
   The region has received 3.13 inches of rain and snow since July
1 compared to 3.15 inches for the same period in 1882-83, the
previous driest July-June in the past 118 years, James said. The
average is 7 inches a year.
   ``With the growing population, we're going to be in a lot of
trouble,'' James said.

<HEAD>Jurist Calls for Guarantees of Citizen Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet jurist called Sunday for strong new laws
to protect citizens' rights while the Soviet Union evolves into a
more open society under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A system of laws and judicial mechanisms should regulate
citizens' access to statistics and archives, guarantee open
information on changes in political leadership, and state what can
be published, legal scholar Yuri Baturin said.
   In material published in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda,
Baturin said new laws will have to make up for the Soviet Union's
lack of experience in guaranteeing citizens' rights.
   Publication in Pravda indicated there was some high-ranking
support for Baturin's ideas.
   ``With the background of our current political culture and as a
temporary measure, this kind of law is necessary,'' he said. ``In
20 or 30 years, if today's political tendencies don't change, the
need for them will be gone.''
   The Soviet Constitution theoretically guarantees broad citizens'
rights, but they often are ignored by Communist Party and
government officials.
   Both the czarist governments of the early 19th century and
today's Soviet government have censorship, but the czarist
governments openly published what the law was, Baturin said.
   In contast, ``it is almost impossible to mention in print our
Glavlit,'' the agency that decides questions of censorship, he said.
   The Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of State and Law has
presented to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's top
executive body, a law ``fixing not only the basic rights and
freedoms of citizens and their associations, touching glasnost, but
the corresponding obligations of responsible officials and state
organs,'' he said.
   Glasnost is Gorbachev's effort to allow freer flow of
information and greater criticism on selected topics.
   In the past year, the Presidium has made no decision on the
institute's proposal.
   Laws and judicial procedures should guarantee access to
archives, statistics and ensure that citizens are given full
information about the appointment and firing of officials, Baturin
said.
   Eleven years since a constitutional article permitted
referendums on important national questions, a similar law is not
in force. A law regulating the mass media has been debated for many
years, ``not openly, but in the corridors,'' Baturin said.
   A program adopted by the party's policy-making Central Committee
for a party conference that begins June 28 bluntly tells Communist
Party members that they must obey the constitution and the laws of
the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Fonda Meeting Declared Start Of `Healing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAUGATUCK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ``almost spiritual'' meeting between
Vietnam veterans and actress Jane Fonda, who angered them by
traveling to North Vietnam, has changed some feelings and led the
local VFW commander to take down an anti-Fonda poster.
   Fonda met privately for 3{ hours Saturday night with about 25
veterans from Connecticut and Massachusetts, where her plans to
film part of a movie this summer have been met with vigorous
protests by some veterans.
   The meeting came a day after she apologized on national
television for hurting veterans with some of her anti-war
activities, including posing for photos on a North Vietnamese
anti-aircraft gun during a trip to Hanoi in 1972 and saying
prisoners of war were lying about having been tortured.
   ``There seemed to be a genuine bonding between Jane Fonda and
the Vietnam veterans who were present,'' said Brian Powell, a
Naugatuck mailman who served in Vietnam in 1969-70. ``There was
finally some clarity about her feelings about why she did what she
did, why she went to Hanoi.''
   Powell, 37, said Fonda told the veterans that ``in her anti-war
passion she did some things that were very stupid and very hurtful
to Vietnam veterans.''
   ``The atmosphere at the meeting was almost spiritual in
nature,'' Powell said, adding that Fonda's message was that ``she
was not anti-veteran, she was anti-war.''
   Fonda said in a statement issued Sunday by her spokesman, Steve
Rivers, that she had wanted to meet with local veterans since
January, when protests heated up over her plans to film ``Union
Street'' in Waterbury, next door to Naugatuck, and Holyoke, Mass.
   ``I've met with Vietnam veterans many times over the years and
I've learned from that experience the importance of doing away with
preconceptions and stereotypes,'' Fonda said. ``That opens the way
for the healing process.
   ``I thought it was a very good meeting. We were totally honest
with each other, and I think we learned a lot about each other. It
was a very moving experience and I hope a helpful one for all of
us.''
   The meeting was set up by Rivers, Powell, Veterans of Foreign
Wars Post 1946 Commander Robert L. Genovese, and the Rev. John
McColley, rector of St. Michael's Episcopal Church and also a
Vietnam veteran. It was held at St. Michael's.
   James Sparrow, executive director of Vietnam Veterans Agent
Orange Victims in Stamford, said Fonda apologized ``a hundred
times'' while the veterans listened, then the veterans asked
questions.
   Genovese said that after the meeting he had a sign promoting
sale of anti-Fonda bumper stickers and a poster featuring a
caricature of the actress taken down in the VFW hall ``to go along
with the spirit of the evening.''
   ``Everybody learned a lot from everybody else. I'm not
completely convinced, but we both have a little better
understanding about each other now,'' said Clayton Hough, a former
Marine from Holyoke, Mass., who lost both legs in Vietnam and wore
an anti-Fonda button into the church.
   The anti-Fonda coalition held three rallies in Waterbury,
including one in April attended by more than 1,000 people. The
Holyoke Board of Alderman voted in February to approve a symbolic
resolution protesting Fonda's film plans in the area.
   The Waterbury Republican and American newspapers have printed
about 450 letters on the controversy, including letters in Fonda's
support from former first lady Rosalynn Carter and former senator
and presidential candidate George McGovern.
   The movie, ``Union Street,'' which also will star Robert DeNiro,
is about a working-class woman fighting her way up the social
ladder who teaches an illiterate man to read. Waterbury and
Holyoke, Mass., were chosen because of their working-class,
industrial characters.

<TEXT>
   From home on the range to home on the
grange, wild mustangs that once faced hunger out West find love and
care on heartland farms and in East Coast stables.
   The federal government's adopt-a-horse program has found new
homes and owners for about 84,000 of these mustangs since the
mid-1970s, helping to thin out the wild herd.
   ``They are wild when you get them, but they turn into
affectionate puppy dogs that follow you around like household
pets,'' said Cesi Bell, attending the latest adoption session in
Danville over the weekend. ``You've got to convince the horse you
are not going to hurt him _ he's got to trust you.''
   Charlie Most of the federal Bureau of Land Management said there
is at least one opportunity a month in the eastern United States
for people to adopt a wild mustang.
   ``Some people expect some scruffy, shaggy, potbellied thing, but
these are very fine looking animals,'' said Most. ``They are not
mean, but they are afraid at first. They need confidence.''
   He expected no trouble finding homes for the 125 horses brought
to this east-central Illinois city.
   ``This place is swarming with people and there is lots of
enthusiasm,'' said Most, as the adoptions began Friday.
   Tens of thousands of the animals are roaming free in several
western states, eating forage meant for cattle. Under a 1971 law
passed in response to complaints from ranchers, the bureau is
required to round up excess wild horses on the Western range.
   It used to kill the surplus animals, but abandoned that practice
in 1982 and started adoptions after protests by animal rights
activists.
   Prospective owners must promise good care and adequate
facilities. They pay $125, which helps cover the cost of catching
the horses, bringing them to the adoption site and providing exams
and shots by a veterinarian.
   ``If someone likes horses and has the facilities, this is a
remarkable opportunity,'' said Most. ``Normally, you couldn't buy a
decent horse for less than $400.''
   It also takes about $30 a month in good feed, fresh water, and a
stall with 6-foot wooden fences.
   Mrs. Bell was at the Danville Livestock Commission as people
arrived to look over the selection of horses. She is a member of
the Midwest Mustang and Burro Association, and offered advice to
those adopting their first mustang.
   It takes patience and time to tame the horses _ perhaps a month
_ and having a radio in the corral with the animals helps them get
used to human voices, she said. ``But not rock'n'roll _ that just
gets them agitated like someone at a disco.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega called Sunday
for another round of talks this month between his leftist
Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported Contra rebels to reach
a permanent truce in the war.
   ``We consider it very important to hold another meeting here in
Managua before June 30,'' Ortega told a news conference. A truce
that began March 21 ends at the end of June.
   In a first meeting March 23 in the southern border post of
Sapoa, the two sides signed an agreement on steps to end the war,
but they have remained deadlocked on details for implementing the
accord.
   The two sides mostly differ on a timetable for the peace process
and on democratic reforms to be taken by the government.
   The Contras lobbied in Washington last week for renewed U.S.
military aid. That aid ended at the end of February, and Congress
voted down a renewal.
   The Sapoa agreement bars the rebels from receiving anything but
humanitarian aid.
   The rebels said at the end of the last talks on June 9 that
there would be no further meetings.
   At the last minute, they presented a proposal that called for
moves previously rejected by the Sandinistas.
   The proposal urged the Sandinistas to free all political
prisoners immediately, rather than gradually as stipulated in the
Sapoa accord; disband the Supreme Court; establish an assembly to
rewrite last year's constitution; and allow soldiers to drop out of
military service if they so desired.
   The Contra proposal was dessribed as ``absurd'' by the
Sandinistas.
   The Reagan administration blamed the breakdown in talks on
alleged Sandinista intransigence.
   On Sunday, Ortega said a new round of talks to start June 26
would be to work on a 32-point government plan. He claimed the two
sides had already agreed on 20 of the points.
   ``We are aware that the situation is not easy,'' Ortega said,
adding that the Reagan administration was trying ``to kill the
negotiating process.''
   The Sandinista proposal offered earlier this month bowed to a
key Contra demand that democratic reforms should take place before
the rebels lay down their weapons. But the rebels said the
government proposal did not go far enough.

<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal visited wounded party
delegates at a hospital Sunday, and newspapers reported seven
underground groups claimed responsibility for his attempted
assassination.
   The 61-year-old leader, his right hand bandaged and in a sling,
told reporters he felt close to death when an escaped convict fired
at him Saturday, but he said: ``I was not afraid.''
   Ozal later told state television that all politicians had
enemies as well as supporters, ``so such incidents are
unavoidable.''
   The premier was delivering an opening speech at a convention of
his Motherland Party when a gunman fired twice at him.
   Police shot the assailant in the arm as people ran for cover.
Sixteen delegates suffered bullet wounds and four were bruised in
the stampede. Ten were hospitalized Sunday.
   Ozal uffered only a hand wound and completed his speech.
   A government prosecutor said the gunman, identified as
32-year-old Kartal Demirag, would be charged with attempting to
kill a member of Parliament. If convicted, he could be sentenced to
death, said prosecutor Ulku Coskun.
   Turkish newspapers reported Sunday that Demirag gave
contradictory testimony following his detention.
   ``I have psychological problems. I did not shoot to kill but
fired to get killed,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The newspapers said seven groups claimed responsibility for the
attack, including the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, the Turkish
Communist Party and several organizations not previously known.
   The papers also said Demirag was a member of the now defunct
neo-fascist National Movement Party's youth organization before
1980.
   The party's youth branch, known as the Gray Wolves, was active
in a wave of terrorism that killed 5,000 people from 1978 to 1980
and prompted the military takeover of 1980.
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who wounded Pope John Paul
II in 1981, also was accused of belonging to the Gray Wolves.
   The newspaper claims could not be verified independently.
   After the shooting, police discovered Demirag was carrying $295
in West German marks and Turkish lira, according to the reports.
   ``The assailant is a prison escapee ... (who) carries foreign
currency. He needs to give explanation to these things. It requires
deep investigation,'' Ozal said.
   Police tightened security at the convention hall for the second
day of the Motherland Party convention, conducting searches and
doublechecking the identification of delegates.
   Demirag, 32, was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to
10 years in prison last year, Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said.
Demirag had been in hiding since he escaped from a low-security
Mugla prison in January, the governor said.
   Beduk said the gun, a British-made eight-shot pistol, jammed
after two shots.
   Prosecutor Nusret Demiral said Demirag did not seem mentally ill.
   ``He might have given his early testimonies under shock, he is
not giving us trouble at the moment. But we are not going to reach
to a conclusion only with his testimonies,'' Demiral told the
Associated Press.
   Demirag spent Friday night in a hotel near the convention hall
under the name of a repairman in the southern province of Adana.
Policemen tracked down the repairman and sent him to Ankara for
questioning, the Anatolia News Agency reported Sunday. No other
details were given.
   Newspapers also reported that Demirag had one or two accomplices
who escaped later. But police officials did not confirm the reports.
   Newspapers also said the showing of the American movie
``Executive Action'' on state television Friday might have given
the idea to the assailant. The movie is about the 1963
assassination of President Kennedy.
   Ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in
1983.
   The premier told state television some people may not like his
policies, which include an end to cigarette smuggling into the
country or his recent talks with Greece. The two countries nearly
went to war over Aegean seabed rights last year.

   More than 30 Western activists have been
expelled from Czechoslovakia for attending an unofficial East-West
seminar organized by Czechoslovak human rights and peace groups,
participants said Sunday.
   The expulsions came after police disrupted a series of private
meetings Friday and Saturday, detained participants, confiscated
materials prepared for the meeting and warned Westerners not to
continue the seminar, Western participants said.
   At a news conference sponsored by the International Helsinki
Federation, which monitors human rights in Eastern Europe, four
Americans who had attended the seminar said 32 people were expelled
Saturday.
   They were among 35 foreign activists from 16 countries who
attended the seminar organized by the Czechoslovak human rights
group Charter 77 and the newly established Czechoslovak Indpendent
Peace Association.
   In a brief report Sunday, the Czechoslovak news agency CTK
carried the first official report on the seminar and police actions.
   It said a group of Charter 77 members had ``tried to misuse
Czechoslovakia's active peace efforts for anti-socialist aims'' by
organzing ``a provacative seminar.''
   ``State organs prevented the provocation in a resolute way,'' it
said. ``Several foreign participants who repeatedly contravened
Czechoslovak laws had to leave the territory of Czechoslovakia.''
   A protest statement drafted by Western participants and signed
also by Czechoslovak activists said: ``We are dismayed and deeply
concerned at the arrest of 19 Czechoslovakians and one Hungarian,
and the police-state tactics of the Czehcolsovakian government,''
   Joanne Landy, of the New York-based Campaign for Peace and
Democracy _ East-West, said 17 people were detained when police
disrupted two workshops on the opening day of the seminar Friday.
She said they were released Saturday morning.
   A Hungarian rights activist, Ferenc Miszlivetz was also detained
Friday and deported the same day, she said.
   Landy said about 12 people were detained Saturday. A
representative of the Helsinki Federation said they had all been
released by 2:00 p.m. Sunday.
   Among the Czechoslovaks detained were Petr Uhl, a member of the
independent Charter 77 human rights group and one of the organizers
of the seminar; Jiri Hajek, a Charter 77 signatory and former
foreign minister; and Stanislav Devaty and Milos Hajek, both
Charter spokesmen.
   Rob Leavitt of the Massachusetts-based Institute for Defense and
Disarmament Studies said foreigners were sent away from the meeting
Saturday with a warning that they faced expulsion if they continued
the seminar.
   A third workshop on conscientious objection and alternatives to
military service was able to take place without interference. Brad
Knott, a peace activist from Washington D.C. who was at that
meeting, said police watched the apartment from a van in the street.
   Judith Hempfling from Amherst, Mass. said the protest statement
was read to about 30 people who gathered at an apartment Saturday
morning. She said it was circulated for signatures as police were
on their way upstairs.
   Leavitt said the foreigners present were ``escorted downstairs,
put in police cars and driven to the central police station.''
   He said 32 foreigners, including one activist from Yugoslavia,
were kept for about five hours in a central waiting room and were
then told they had to leave the country by midnight.
   ``The activities of the Czechoslovakian govenment fly in the
face of recent East bloc promises for democratic reform,'' the
protest statement said.

<HEAD>Patriarch Of Crow Indian Tribe Dies At 98</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LODGE GRASS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Summers Yellowtail Sr., a
patriarch of the Crow Indian Tribe and a modern-day warrior who
fought the tribe's battles with words, has died at the age of 98.
   Yellowtail, who died at his home Saturday, studied law and
planned to become a lawyer, but instead became involved in tribal
affairs and politics. The University of Montana School of Law
eventually awarded him an honorary degree.
   Yellowtail said his most memorable experience was a war of words
in the U.S. Capitol on April 6, 1917, when all the great chiefs of
the Crow Tribe gathered in Washington to fight homesteading on
their reservation, site of Custer's Last Stand on the Little
Bighorn.
   The chiefs met with the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to
defend their people against a proposal by Sen. Thomas J. Walsh of
Montana, who wanted to open their reservation to white settlement
and who had a reputation as one of the best legal minds of the era.
   The old chiefs did not speak English and the task of arguing
their case fell to Yellowtail, then a 28-year-old law student.
   ``The gallery was jammed full of spectators,'' Yellowtail once
recalled. ``They said I would have 18 minutes to answer Sen. Walsh,
but I took 4{ hours.''
   World War I interrupted his speech when the committee was called
to a special assembly in which President Woodrow Wilson asked
Congress to declare war on Germany.
   But the committee reconvened to hear Yellowtail and, when he
finished, Walsh withdrew his proposal.
   Yellowtail served several times as tribal chairman, and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs appointed him superintendent of the
reservation, the first Indian named to the post, which he held for
11 years.
   During the Eisenhower administration of the 1950s he was offered
the post of commissioner of Indian affairs, but turned it down.
   ``I never did get along with the Indian bureau, even when I
worked for it,'' he said.
   Yellowtail Dam on the reservation is named for him, even though
he opposed the dam from the beginning and never changed his mind.
   He also ran a successful cattle ranch near this southeastern
Montana reservation town.
   Funeral services were tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Polish Passport Regulations Eased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Ministry has approved changes
that will make it easier for Poles to travel to the West, the
official news agency PAP announced Sunday.
   The regulations, which take effect Monday, will allow Poles
temporarily staying abroad to invite anyone to visit, rather that
just close family as in the past.
   All Poles must have some form of invitation to apply for a
passport, a regulation introduced after the imposition of martial
law in 1981.
   Poles still will not be allowed to keep their passports at home,
but prospective travelers will be able to pick up their passports
immediately after submitting a short request form.
   Poles still face obstacles before they go abroad because they
must obtain visas to visit Western countries. It can take weeks and
even months to obtain a visa for such popular destinations as
England, Italy or West Germany.
   About 6 million Poles will travel abroad this year compared to
5.2 million in 1987, according to the Interior Ministry.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said at a news conference
Sunday that lack of a computer system to keep track of passports is
the main reason Poland does not allow citizens to keep their
passports with them.

<HEAD>All-Republican Board Declares Democrat Kerrey Nominee of
Independent Party</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Changes second reference to governor to Mrs. Orr, sted Orr.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROL ZUEGNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's all-Republican Board of
Canvassers has declared Democratic former Gov. Bob Kerrey, who's
seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican David Karnes, the
nominee of an independent party _ as the result of a primary in
which he received 20 votes.
   Under state law, Kerrey can only run as the candidate of one
party. Although it's believed he'll continue his candidacy as a
Democrat, Kerrey has said he won't immediately decline the
nomination of the New Alliance Party.
   At first, the board, which includes Republican Gov. Kay Orr and
four other high state Republican officials, said the party's
nomination was won by Ernie Chambers, an unconventional state
legislator whose political hero is Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Some observers believed that Chambers, the state's only black
legislator, might harm Kerrey's chances for election by drawing off
liberal and black votes.
   Although Karnes, appointed by Mrs. Orr in 1987 to fill the
unexpired term of the late Democratic Sen. Ed Zorinsky, made a
strong showing in the Republican primary, the most recent poll
showed him trailing Kerrey by 16 percentage points.
   On Friday, however, the board reversed itself and said Kerrey,
not Chambers, had received the most votes _ 20 _ from those
requesting ballots for the NAP. Chambers, the board said, actually
finished fourth with five votes; originally, it said he won the
nomination with four votes.
   In the Democratic primary, Kerrey had 153,500 votes, or 92
percent of the total cast.
   ``The situation revealed this week may possibly be no
accident,'' Kerrey said in a prepared statement Thursday.
   ``This doesn't appear to be a simple mistake,'' he added,
referring to Chambers' candidacy.
   Mrs. Orr, who succeeded the highly popular Kerrey in 1986 when
he declined to seek re-election, said the Democrat overreacted.
   The lesson from the confusion, she said, was that the state's
election laws need to be modified.
   ``Four votes _ certainly to my mind _ or 20 or 50 or 100 do not
duly constitute a viable nominee or candidate for a statewide
election,'' she said.
   However, state Attorney General Robert Spire, a Republican and
also a member of the canvassing board, said he would appoint an
independent special assistant to examine the activities of the
board.
   Kerrey's campaign manager, Bill Hoppner, said Friday the issue
isn't who was nominated by the New Alliance Party but how the votes
were counted.
   ``We need to know why the votes weren't counted correctly the
first time,'' he said.
   The New Alliance Party had only 14 registered voters in Nebraska
going into the May 10 primary. That number has reached at least 15,
since Chambers switched his registration from that of an
independent.
   In the May 10 primary, the party had only a space for write-in
votes.
   On a national level, the party's presidential candidate, Lenora
B. Fulani of New York, received $205,565 in federal matching funds
in January. She's seeking the party's nomination on some state
ballots and is trying to run under the banner of other political
parties in other states.
   Chambers, a barber who has a law degree from Creighton
University, said he wants to run for senator because both Kerrey
and Karnes are young _ Kerrey is 44 and Karnes is 39 _ and whoever
is elected may serve a long time. The 50-year-old legislator still
has several options to get on the November ballot.
   Chambers, who represents a predominantly black district in North
Omaha, said he also intends to run for the legislative seat he has
held since 1971. His reading of state law leads him to believe he
may run for both offices, he said.
   Nebraskans have learned to expect the unexpected from Chambers,
who wears a sweatshirt or T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes in the
Legislature. He refuses to take the bar exam because he says the
state shouldn't have the authority to issue the license.
   Instead, he rents a chair in a barbershop in his North Omaha
district. But he spends most of his time in his Capitol office,
where mountains of newspaper clippings, reports and other papers
cover his desk. Posters and pictures of Khadafi decorate the walls.
   Chambers said he admires Khadafy's resilience, his never-say-die
attitude, and what he has done for the Libyan people in social
services.
   Last year, he successfully sponsored a bill to pay University of
Nebraska football players and athletes in the Big Eight conference.
However, Mrs. Orr vetoed it.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is ill prepared to
guard against security breaches when teams of Soviet inspectors
arrive on U.S. military bases July 1 as part of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, a magazine reported
Sunday.
   The pact, sealed in Moscow May 31 by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, provides for the elimination of
nuclear missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles.
   It also allows the Soviets to send inspectors to 26 sites in the
United States and Europe to make sure the missiles have been
destroyed as agreed. The U.S. military will send inspectors to 133
Soviet-bloc bases.
   However, U.S. News & World Report said in this week's edition
that the United States does not have enough trained personnel to
prevent the Soviets from seeing facilities and equipment they are
not supposed to see.
   The magazine said the number of trained U.S. agents assigned to
the Pentagon's Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures Program,
which guards U.S. bases from electronic surveillance by hostile
intelligence agencies, has been cut from 160 to 32 in the past six
years.
   Only 10 of those agents are assigned to bases in the United
States, while the others are at U.S. bases overseas. However, U.S.
News said Pentagon sources, which it did not identify, said at
least 30 such agents are needed in the United States.
   The Soviets are arriving in less than two weeks, yet it takes
eight months to train a countersurveillance agent, the sources told
the magazine.
   The magazine also said mock Soviet inspections of U.S. bases
conducted by the Defense Department during the past four months
turned up a number of mistakes.
   U.S. officials playing the part of Soviet inspectors were able
to elude their trained escorts for up to an hour, copy down
classified information on data plates on weapon systems and enter a
sensitive weapons facility on the way to an inspection area.

<TEXT>
   Nine people were reported dead Sunday
after rioting between ethnic Indians and native Pakistanis in the
southeastern city of Hyderabad.
   The riots started Saturday after buses filled with Pakistanis
arrived in Hyderabad, 84 miles north of Karachi, and opened fire on
the immigrants, witnesses said.
   The Indian Moslem immigrants came to Pakistan after its
partition from India in 1947 and are demanding recognition as a
separate ethnic group. A majority of them live in the southern
province of Sind, which includes Karachi and Hyderabad.
   Five people with gunshot wounds were taken to a hospital in
Karachi, doctors said. Another 35 were being treated at hospitals
in Hyderabad.
   After quelling the riots, police imposed a curfew on Hyderabad.
Businesses, offices and schools were closed and police in riot gear
patrolled the streets and warned residents to stay at home.
   The curfew has created food problems for the city's 1 million
residents, many of whom were not able to reach local markets.
   ``There is nothing in my house to cook,'' said Hayat Balock, an
elderly resident. ``I do not have (a refrigerator), so I buy
essential goods every day.''
   Residents contacted by telephone said police were warning people
to stay indoors or risk being shot.
   Ethnic riots in the past two years have killed hundreds of
people in Sind province and Karachi, a port city on the Indian
Ocean where the rival ethnic groups share cramped, squalid slums,
and compete for scarce jobs.
   In May, at least 30 people died in such clashes, and the
violence still flares every few weeks.

   A grandstand collapsed Sunday during
festivities to celebrate links between a French and West German
town, and 30 people were slightly injured, officials said.
   Seventeen people attending the festivities at the La Tour
d'Hautil chateau west of Paris were rushed to hospitals in
surrounding suburbs for examinations, but most suffered simply
bruises and scrapes, fire officials said.
   They said seven children were among the injured when the stands,
which rose eight feet, collapsed.
   The festivities marked the 20th anniversary since the French
town of Triel and the West German town of Selingenstadt became
sister cities.
   German firefighters taking part in the celebration helped in the
rescue operation.
   Only one of several stands on the grounds collapsed.
   Officials in nearby Versailles said the festivities continued.
   Officials were investigating the collapse.

   A man armed with a shotgun walked into a
sheriff's office Sunday and killed a radio dispatcher with a single
blast, then freed two prisoners in the parish lockup, authorities
said.
   Authorities mounted a massive search in northeast Louisiana for
an ex-convict they allege was responsible for killing Deputy Jeff
Gathings, 23.
   The suspect, 19-year-old Frank Bancroft, had been released from
jail Tuesday after serving a sentence for theft, said West Carroll
Parish Sheriff Gary Bennett.
   Set free were Sonny Caston, 20, and his brother, Frank Caston,
21. Both men had criminal records and were in the parish jail
awaiting trial on burglary and arson charges, Bennett said.
Bancroft and the Castons had been fellow inmates.
   Bennett said authorities are working on the assumption that
Bancroft plotted the break with the Castons prior to being released.
   Authorities set up road blocks around Oak Grove, located about
10 miles south of the Arkansas state line. Authorities found a
black Chevrolet pickup truck that may have been used by the three
men Sunday afternoon near the Castons' hometown of Lake Providence,
on the Mississippi River about 10 miles east of Oak Grove.
   Bennett said Gathings was alone in the radio room, adjacent to
the jail, when the killer entered.
   Inmates at the jail heard the blast of the 12-gauge shotgun and
saw Bancroft let the Castons out of jail, Bennett said. ``All of
them (the inmates) know him,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett said the door to the sheriff's office is locked at night
ordinarily; if normal procedures were followed, Gathings would have
had to push a button to unlock the door electronically and let any
outsiders enter. Television cameras allow the dispatcher to monitor
the entrance, the sheriff said.

   Police are searching for a thief; they say someone
has been stealing the fancy doorknobs from doors at police
headquarters.
   It may be the same person who is defacing walls and signs in the
building with graffiti _ in some cases altering signs to change the
word ``legal'' to ``illegal.''
   The doorknobs bearing the city seal are apparently valuable
souvenirs, police spokesman Jim Jordan said. In the past few weeks
a half dozen have been stolen from doors on the middle floors.
   ``To be sure nothing else like this or worse can happen, we're
installing surveillance equipment,'' he said.
   Detectives are investigating the doorknob thefts, he said,
although it doesn't rank high on their priority list when compared
with the city's serious crime.

<HEAD>Parliamentary Delegation Goes To Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four members of Parliament flew to Tehran Sunday
to seek improved relations with Iran and they warned against
raising hopes the visit might lead to the release of foreign
hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``We are cautiously optimistic,'' said Cyril Townsend at
Heathrow Airport before he and the three others boarded an Iranair
jet. ``This is very much a toe-in-the-water type operation.''
   Members of the delegation are Townsend and Robert Hicks of the
governing Conservative Party, Thomas Clarke of the Labor Party and
Lord Tordoff, a Social Liberal Democrat.
   Tordoff told an airport news conference that reports of the trip
had blown out of proportion the hope for winning the release of
three British hostages believed held in Lebanon.
   The Britons are among 18 foreign hostages held in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. It is believed most were kidnapped by
pro-Iranian Moslem extremists.
   Tordoff said the delegation does not know if it will discuss the
hostages during the visit to the Iranian capital.
   ``It's clearly something that is at the back of our minds and is
important in the general relationship between the two countries. To
say that we have a specific item on our agenda would be quite
wrong,'' he said.
   The legislators said they were not taking any messages from the
hostages' families.
   ``We are fully aware of how strongly they (the families) feel
and that's one of the reasons it would be quite improper for us to
build up people's hopes,'' said Clarke.
   The delegates said they did not know their program, how long
they would be in Iran or with whom they would be meeting, although
they expected to see Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The mission, arranged privately through the office of the
archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, is not sponsored by the
government and the delegates said their purpose is to try to ease
strains between Britain and Iran.
   But there have been many expressions of hope that an improvement
of relations might increase the chances for the release of the
British hostages.
   One of the Britons, 49-year-old Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, in Beirut while on a mission for the
archbishop of Canterbury to help free the hostages.
   British television journalist John McCarthy, 31, has been
missing since Feb. 17, 1986, and Alec Collett, 64, a New York-based
journalist, disappeared March 25, 1985, while on assignment for the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency.
   An Islamic extremist organization reported Collett was killed,
but there has been no proof he is dead.
   Most of the missing foreigners are believed to be held captive
by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iran Shiite Moslem group.
   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
in Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Relations between Britain and Iran deteriorated sharply last
summer after retaliatory diplomatic expulsions, the beating of a
British diplomat in Tehran and the shoplifting arrest of an Iranian
diplomat in Britain.
   Mohammad Jawad Larijani, Iran's deputy foreign minister for
European and American affairs, said the recent agreement to pay
claims for damages to each other's embassies was a sign of growing
cooperation.
   Larijani, speaking in an interview carried by Tehran Radio and
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, said the visit by the four Britons
could pave the way for cooperative exchanges in economic,
scientific and cultural matters.

   President Reagan and French President Francois
Mitterrand sidestepped thorny topics on Sunday and used a 35-minute
meeting to discuss relations with the Soviet Union and problems in
education, a spokesman said.
   The two men, attended by senior officials, met before the formal
opening of the economic summit for a session French spokesman
Hubert Vedrine described as cordial and warm.
   Two key summit issues on which Reagan and Mitterrand have
conflicting views _ agricultural subsidies and Third World debt
relief _ were not brought up, Vedrine said.
   Reagan opened the session by asking Mitterrand, re-elected last
month, what his priorities would be in his second seven-year term,
Vedrine said.
   The French president said he would concentrate on education,
after which Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz commented
on efforts to improve American schools, the spokesman added.
   Mitterrand and Reagan also discussed relations with the Soviet
Union, agreeing that disarmament talks should seek a balance in
conventional weapons in Europe and that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``needs peace'' to make the changes he wants in Soviet
society, Vedrine said.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker III also participated in the
meeting, as did French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy and
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   Mitterrand is staunchly opposed to Reagan's effort to get the
leaders of the seven industrialized democracies to endorse
elimination of farm subsidies. Mitterrand's major summit
initiative, a plan to ease the debt burden of the poorest
countries, has encountered U.S. opposition.

<HEAD>Thatcher Apologizes to Kohl Over Soccer Hooliganism</HEAD>

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
apologized Sunday to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the
hooliganism displayed by British soccer spectators in his country,
officials said.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher apologized deeply. She was very upset and very
angry,'' West German government spokesman Friedhelm Ost told
reporters. He said that in a nearly hour-long private meeting, Mrs.
Thatcher told Kohl she supports stiff sentences for people involved
in such rowdyism.
   A British official said Mrs. Thatcher apologized to Kohl ``in
forthright terms'' for the British rowdies' behavior during last
week's European Championship matches in West Germany. More than 50
Britons were arrested.
   ``The prime minister expressed her very great concern that this
sort of thing should have been inflicted on the West German
people,'' said the British official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified.
   He said Mrs. Thatcher told Kohl she hoped West German courts
would impose stiff setences and ``not be deterred at the prospect
of having to keep them (the jailed spectators) there.'' She noted
that under West European agreements, nationals jailed in a foreign
country could be repatriated to serve their sentences.
   Mrs. Thatcher also thanked Kohl, her spokesman said, for the
``firm way'' West German police dealt with the British hooligans.
   On Friday, the British Cabinet, after an emergency meeting on
the notorious behavior of British soccer fans in other European
countries, ordered the soccer authorities to take stern measures,
including ensuring that only listed club members are permitted to
follow teams.
   English football authorities withdrew an application for English
clubs to be allowed to compete again in Europe. They were banned
after a rampage in which 39 people were killed at a Belgium stadium
in 1985.
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher spent nearly an hour sightseeing in
Toronto's bay area under heavy security.
   Police on Saturday arrested on immigration charges an Irishman,
Michael Derek Collins, 31, who is suspected of having links with
the IRA and is wanted for questioning by police in British-run
Northern Ireland.
   Mrs. Thatcher also met separately with the new Italian Prime
Minister, Ciriaco De Mita, in what her aides said was mainly a
``getting acquainted session.''

<HEAD>Best AIDS `Cure' Is Behavioral Education, Women In Medicine Say</HEAD>

   Educating people that everyone stands at
risk of AIDS ranks as the most important duty facing doctors,
members of the American Women in Medicine Association say.
   Dr. Virginia Anderson, director of the Pediatric AIDS Study
Group in New York, told the gathering of about 60 female
health-care professionals that all categories of society face the
danger of becoming infected with HIV, adding:
   ``If the behavioral change could follow the education, there
need not be another new case of HIV,'' or human immunodeficiency
virus.
   ``Since we have nothing to treat (AIDS) with, our job is to
teach to change our behavior,'' association President Doris
Bartuska said.
   The doctors, meeting to discuss the impact of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome on women and children, were told by Anderson
and other speakers that people must be made to realize that HIV
exposure is not limited to homosexual men and to intravenous drug
users, two of the population categories at highest risk.
   ``AIDS is in the heterosexual population. It is in the
heterosexual female population, and it is not always in the groups
that have been high-risk groups in the past,'' said Dr. Mary
Guinan, assistant director for science at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   Guinan gave CDC data showing that of 4,738 reported cases of
AIDS in women as of April 30, the majority _ 52 percent _
contracted the disease through intravenous drug use; of the 12,684
heterosexual men with the disease, 69 percent contracted it through
intravenous drug use.
   But the percentage differed greatly when heterosexual contact
was determined to be the cause of the infection. In heterosexual
men, 2 percent contracted AIDS through sexual contact with the
opposite sex, while 24 percent of the women were infected the same
way.
   ``It's not kinky sex that puts people at risk,'' Guinan said.
``It's sex, normal sex ... and the number of sex partners.''
   She said CDC data also show that women are the source of 80
percent of AIDS cases in infants, infecting their children either
through childbirth or before birth.
   Guinan said the best method of fighting the spread of AIDS is to
fight for better sex education, ``which includes a healthy sexual
lifestyle.''
   She told the physicians to encourage condom use, but even
better, to call for celibacy or monogamy.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishop Meets With Cuban Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARKSVILLE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic bishop from Miami met
Sunday with Cuban inmates at the Avoyelles Parish Jail, where a
disturbance two weeks ago led to a nine-day hunger strike.
   Auxiliary Bishop Agustin A. Roman of Miami, who last year helped
end violent sieges by Cubans at two federal prisons, spent about 35
minutes visiting individual cells to talk with prisoners. He told
reporters later that the message he delivered was a sprititual one.
   ``We are not orphans and we have a Father,'' Roman said. ``We
have one Father and he is in heaven.''
   Last November, Roman helped negotiate an end to inmate takeovers
at a federal detention center in Oakdale, La., and a federal prison
in Atlanta.
   Roman said Saturday the United States must ensure that the Cuban
government will respect the rights of Cubans forced by this country
to return to their homeland.
   ``Every country should have the right to expel any undesirable
persons,'' Roman said. ``We're concerned about the situation in
Cuba. We are not sure human rights are served in Cuba.''
   The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service is reviewing
the cases of thousand of Cubans in the United States.
   When Cuban leader Fidel Castro agreed last year to take back
many of the Cuban exiles, it sparked the Oakdale and Atlanta riots
among detainees who wanted to stay in this country.
   Many of the detainees have served sentences for crimes committed
in this country and are awaiting word from the INS on whether they
must be deported, remain in prison, sent to halfway houses or freed.
   Since the riots, officials have dispersed Cubans to lockups
around the nation. Roman said Saturday that about 900 Cubans have
been freed as a result of the agreement that ended the riots.
   About 200 Cubans are at the Avoyelles jail, where more than a
dozen took over a large cell two weeks ago and held it for seven
hours. After deputies regained control, about 45 inmates said they
were going on a hunger strike to protest jail conditions and the
slow pace of INS review of their cases.
   The strike ended last week after inmates said they were assured
that Cubans' cases were being expedited, although INS officials
publicly said they made no deals.
   Roman said Sunday that the inmates he talked to ``are happy and
are waiting to be free with their families.''
   On Friday, federal officials announced that almost 1,000 Cubans
were being told their requests for freedom were being rejected and
that they faced deportation. Inmate Jose Lopez, 42, a spokesman for
the hunger strikers, said Sunday that 36 Avoyelles Cubans had been
rejected. But he said they can appeal that decision to the Justice
Department.

<HEAD>More Hot, Dry Air Over Central Part Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An area of high pressure accompanied by high temperatures was in
place Sunday to continue dry weather over the central part of the
nation, while thunderstorms rained on the South.
   The high pressure area, centered over northeastern New Mexico,
extended northward to cover the central Plains, the central Rockies
and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah.
   It would divert any major weather systems up across southern
Canada and maintain dry weather across much of the Plains and as
the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   During the night, showers and thunderstorms moved across parts
of Minnesota and Wisconsin but drought-stricken areas of
northwestern Minnesota got little benefit.
   The high pressure also pushed hot air across the central Plains
and Missouri Valley with highs in the mid 90s as far as South
Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, and between 100 and 105 degrees
over parts of south-central Nebraska and north-central Kansas.
   Record highs Sunday were 92 at Alpena, Mich., a tie; 89 at
Duluth, Minn.; 88 at International Falls, Minn., a tie; 97 at
Kansas City, Mo.; 86 at Marquette, Mich.; 100 at North Platte,
Neb.; 100 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 102 at Sioux Falls, S.D.
   Thunderstorms were widespread across the lower Mississippi
Valley, accompanied by heavy rain.
   Thunderstorms also occurred over the central Appalachians, the
Florida Peninsula, the southern tip of Texas, central California
and northwestern Arizona. Thunderstorms also developed during the
afternoon across western Georgia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 105 at Cozad, Neb., and Hill
City, Kan. Sunday morning's low was 36 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from central and southern Georgia into the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast and Florida. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were
forecast between the central Sierra Nevada and the central Rockies,
and over northern New England.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were predicted along the California
coast into the Pacific Northwest, and from the northern Great Lakes
region into the upper Ohio Valley and the northern Appalachian
Mountains; around 100 from south-central Nebraska through western
and central Kansas into western Oklahoma, from extreme eastern
Montana into western South Dakota, and from the central valleys of
California into the desert Southwest; and in the 90s across much of
the rest of the nation.

   Leftist guerrillas on Sunday attacked
two Colombian towns, killing at least eight people including four
policemen, state and local authorities reported.
   Guerrillas stormed the town of Supia, 124 miles northwest of the
capital of Bogota, authorities in the state of Caldas reported.
They said the attack was by rebels of the Popular Liberation Army,
a Maoist organization.
   ``More than 100 armed guerrillas, women and men, joined in the
attack,'' a Caldas official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He said the guerrillas attacked two banks and the town's
main square where peasants were attending a local fair.
   ``They killed four policemen, one bank employee and a campesino
(peasant)'' in the one-hour raid and then fled, the official said.
He did not provide further details.
   Guerrillas from the rebel group M-19 attacked the town of Silvia
in the state of Cauca, 186 miles south of the capital, according to
local authorities. They said the gunmen robbed a farmers
cooperative and then left taking two rsidents as hostages.
   The captives were slain outside the town, said a spokesman for
the army's Third Brigade.

   About 1,000 young people mocked nationwide
elections Sunday with a rally and march in Warsaw's Old Town. A
police captain responded with humor instead of force.
   The officer even loaned his loudspeaker to the demonstrators.
   The Warsaw youths reflected the Wroclaw-based ``Orange
Alternative'' movement that in recent years has held ``happenings''
that poke fun but do not directly attack the communist state.
   Dressed in mainly white costumes, groups of high school and
university students marched through the cobble-stoned streets
Sunday afternoon chanting ``Everybody to the polls'' and ``All
power to the councils.''
   They were referring to the elections to municipal and provincial
People's Councils.
   One man waved a red banner with a picture of Lenin and another
carried a flag of the Socialist Youth Union. Many held aloft copies
of the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu or folded it into
paper hats.
   At the Old Town's market square, the ``dwarfs'' _ as
participants called themselves _ swarmed around a parked police
command jeep. Rally leaders conferred with the police captain and
the two sides agreed on a 20-minute rally.
   The captain then loaned his loudspeaker to the ``head dwarf'' to
relay the message. ``Do you want to disperse in 20 minutes?'' the
rally leader asked. ``No'' the crowd chanted back.
   But appreciative of the unusual sight of a demonstrator speaking
over a police loudspeaker, the people began chanting: ``Captain
Captain.''
   The head dwarf then read a news item from Trybuna Ludu that said
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev plans to come to Poland in July.
The crowd roared its approval and sang a round of ``Sto Lat'' _ the
Polish equivalent of ``For he's a jolly good fellow.''
   The demonstrators next held a mock election, spoofing among
others government spokesman Jerzy Urban, before voting on a
candidate named ``Jan Council-less.''
   After a march to nearby Castle Square the captain finally got
the youths to disperse with this exchange:
   ``Dwarfs, listen, roll up the banners,'' the police officer said
``Let's bid farewell nicely. We'll give you all teddy bears.''
   ``Kiss, kiss,'' the demonstrators demanded.
   ``All right, senior dwarf, come over here and I'll give you a
kiss,'' replied the captain, who would not give his name to
reporters.
   ``Listen,'' he continued. ``Let's stop it. ... I haven't had my
lunch yet.''
   ``Good appetite,'' the crowd wished him back.
   When the captain persisted the crowd started chanting,
``Gargamel,'' the name of the villain in the Polish television
version of an American cartoon series about blue-skinned ``Smurfs.''
   ``Don't insult me,'' the blue-uniformed captain retorted,
showing he watches television too. ``I'm not Gargamel. I'm a
Smurf.''
   People in the crowd laughed and began going home.

<HEAD>Mrs. Reagan Arrives Early At Dinner, Gets Unscheduled Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Nancy Reagan got an unscheduled tour
of the University of Toronto on Sunday after she showed up earlier
than protocol dictated for a dinner for spouses of leaders at the
economic summit.
   Mila Mulroney, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
as the hostess was the first to arrive at the dinner at the Royal
Ontario Museum.
   The visiting first ladies were supposed to arrive in the reverse
order of their husbands' seniority in office _ the procedure
required by diplomatic nicety.
   This meant Anna Maria DeMita of Italy first, Naoko Takeshita of
Japan second, Hannelore Kohl of West Germany third and Mrs. Reagan
last. The spouses of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
French President Francois Mitterrand did not come to Toronto.
   The plan went awry when Mrs. Reagan's motorcade drove into view
shortly after Mrs. DeMita's arrival and before either Mrs.
Takeshita or Mrs. Kohl had showed up.
   Aides to the firt lady who were waiting outside the museum
radioed a warning to the motorcade and it continued on its way.
   Wendy Webber, a spokesman for Mrs. Reagan, said the first lady
arrived at the time appointed, and she did not know what caused the
mix-up.
   At any rate, after Mrs. Takeshita and Mrs. Kohl had entered the
museum, Mrs. Reagan's motorcade rolled up for the second time.
   Asked what happened as she walked into the building, Mrs. Reagan
gave a diplomatic answer.
   ``We wanted to see the college,'' she said.
   The campus is near the museum.

<HEAD>Report: General Motors Assisted State in Undercover Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. helped the Maryland
attorney general's office in an undercover investigation of an
automobile repair business, according to a published report Sunday.
   The giant automaker made cars and transmissions available as
part of a nationwide program to help combat fraud in the industry,
The (Baltimore) Sun quoted David A. Collins, a lawyer for GM in
Detroit, as saying. He said the company has contributed to
investigations in other states as part of a three-year program that
has received virtually no public recognition.
   A consumer advocate questioned the ethics of GM's role because
of the company's financial interest in the auto repair industry.
The nation's largest automaker not only provides replacement parts
but also has paid out millions of dollars for repairs in a 1983
settlement of a case involving allegedly faulty transmissions in
about 5 million cars.
   ``From an attorney general's perspective, a lot of them could
use some help in ferreting out these bad repair shops, but I'm not
sure they should accept help from a business that has a financial
interest in it,'' said Russell J. Shew, a spokesman for the Center
for Auto Safety, an independent non-profit consumer group based in
Washington.
   ``It's kind of a muddy ethical question, no question about it,''
said Lawrence P. Mutter, executive vice president of the Automotive
Parts Rebuilders Association.
   GM cars and transmissions were among those used in a Maryland
sting operation resulting in consumer fraud charges against Cottman
Transmission Systems Inc., based in Fort Washington, Pa., according
to court documents cited by the Sun.
   The state attorney general alleged that 11 of the 13 Cottman
shops in Maryland violated consumer laws by making unnecessary
repairs, charging for work not performed and withholding cost
estimates until after work was begun on cars that had been in
perfect repair or had only minor problems.
   Attorneys for the Cottman chain have denied the charges.
   Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. and William
Leibovici, an assistant attorney general who heads the office's
consumer protection division, declined to comment. They cited a
partial gag order imposed by a Baltimore judge.
   Telephone calls by The Associated Press to the homes of GM
spokesmen Donald Postma and John F. Mueller went unanswered Sunday.
   But Collins acknowledged that the carmaker had approached the
state of Maryland and offered to supply automobiles and
transmissions for sting operations in other states.
   Collins declined to say how many other states have used GM's
services in undercover operations, but put the overall national
cost at ``under $1 million and probably less than half a million
dollars.''

<HEAD>Old Jail To Be New Home For Disadvantaged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old city jail with medieval-style turrets and
thick stone walls would be transformed into a complex of 67
low-cost apartments for working poor people under an ambitious
project by an urban ministry.
   The Atlanta Stockade, once a debtors' prison, is listed in the
National Register of Historic Places. From 1897 until the 1920s, it
housed criminals. Except for limited use by the city's school
board, the building has been empty for most of the past 60 years.
   The renovated prison, to be called Glencastle, would be a
partial answer to the housing crisis faced by working poor people,
according to Renny Scott, project coordinator for the Family
Consultation Service.
   The apartments, he said in an interview last week, will be for
``precisely the person who's being priced out of the housing
market. There are people who spend 75 percent of their income on
housing.''
   In 1985, two developers bought the stockade property, which
includes a 25,000-square-foot warehouse _ formerly the prison
stables _ and an old blacksmith shop. They planned to turn it into
luxury condominiums.
   But they were unable to get the financing they needed. They
couldn't sell it to another developer. And they couldn't even tear
it down and start over; the cost of destroying the stockade's 2- to
3-foot-thick walls would have been too high.
   Family Consultation Service, located in the southeast Atlanta
neighborhood around the stockade, was looking for space to store
and sell home fixtures.
   ``We wanted the warehouse,'' Scott said. ``It was perfect for
what we wanted to do. But the guys that owned it said we had to
take the prison, too.''
   Officials of FCS, which helps inner-city residents, contemplated
uses for the building; Scott suggested housing. A local businessman
spent $210,000 to buy the property for FCS, and Scott, 43, was
named coordinator.
   ``It took us about six months to figure out which questions to
ask, and another six months to get them answered,'' he said.
``We're about 60 days away from the end of our pre-development
phase.''
   Individuals and groups from the Atlanta area have donated time
and skills to produce architectural plans and cost estimates.
   The total cost of the Glencastle project, including the
conversion of the blacksmith shop into a chapel and community
center, may reach $3 million, Scott said.
   ``We're looking for about one-third of it to come from in-kind
donations, from the plumbers and electrical people and so forth.
Another one-third we hope to get from corporations, foundations and
sources like that.
   ``The final third we hope to get from a public campaign,'' he
said. FCS wants to encourage people to purchase units for the cost
of their conversion, approximately $20,000, and donate them for
rental.
   Each of the one- and two-room efficiency apartments will measure
about 300 square feet and will rent for no more than $200 per month.
   Glencastle residents will enjoy a life far different from that
of their predecessors.
   Adult male convicts from the stockade were forced to work on
chain gangs. Female and young male prisoners cleaned, cooked and
worked the prison's farm.
   All the inmates toiled in a quarry near the stockade. Though
most had been convicted of minor offenses, prisoners were kept in
chains, which they forged in the blacksmith shop, Scott said.
   Despite its harsh history, the jail is a distinctive building. A
broad porch with five fluted columns stretches across the front.
Barred windows are generous; some offer a view of Atlanta's
skyline. Each corner sports a turret, once used as a guard tower.

<TEXT>
   Iranian fighters opposed to the regime of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini captured this Iranian border town
Sunday. Iran claimed Iraqi army units attacked the town using
chemical weapons ``on a large scale.''
   The town, mainly a pile of rubble from earlier battles between
Iranian and Iraqi armies, was filled with cheering fighters of the
National Liberation Army including many women.
   Mehran, beside the border on the central front and about 100
miles east of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, has changed hands four
times since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in September 1980.
   On Sunday there was no indication of a major battle in the town
_ no bodies, no wounded, no destroyed vehicles or fires.
   Leaders of the anti-Khomeini Iranians said most of the fighting
occurred in the foothills of the mountains to the north and south
where artillery controls the town and that the offensive punched 12
miles into Iran at its deepest point.
   A press officer at the Baghdad headquarters of the National
Liberation Army told reporters the group's fighters ``liberated''
Mehran in a major offensive that started Saturday night.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press office in Baghdad,
the group's commander, Massoud Rajavi, said the capture of Mehran
Sunday morning ``is a great victory and a basic step toward the
overthrow of Khomeini's oppressive regime.''
   ``Thousands of of enemy troops under Khomeini's command have
either been killed, wounded or captured,'' the statement said but
it gave no specific figures.
   Liberation Army leaders in Mehran said 1,400 Iranian government
troopers were taken prisoner. They acknowledged 48 of their
fighters were killed and said casualty figures were incomplete.
   A report by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, said ``a large number of Iranian
Moslem combatants were martyred and injured when Iraqi warplanes
chemically bombed the Changuleh region east of Mehran.
   ``Earlier in the day, Iraqi warplanes had chemically bombed the
town of Mehran.''
   IRNA said Iranian special units were dispatched to ``neutralize
the cheical weapons using special techniques'' and that hundreds of
Iraqis were killed in fighting near the town.
   It also reported Iranian warplanes flew five missioons to bomb
Iraqi positions in the Mehran area.
   An earlier dispatch from IRNA said a six-pronged attack on
Mehran was repulsed and that Iranian troops were mopping up enemy
positions.
   Iraq denied its forces were involved in the attack on Mehran or
that chemical weapons were used.
   Iranian claims that chemical weapons had been used against its
forces in Mehran are ``nothing more than a pretext to explain away
a new military setback,'' said Latif Nusayyif Jasim, Iraq's culture
and information minister.
   ``The attack ... was mounted by forces of the National
Liberation Army of Mujahedeen Khalq, which have no chemical weapons
in their possession,'' Jasim said, according to a statement carried
by the official Iraqi News Agency, INA.
   Iraq said its combat aircraft flew 553 combat missions Sunday,
the highest number since fighting renewed last Monday with an
Iranian offensive in the Salamcheh region east of the southern
Iraqi city of Basra.
   Iraq also said its forces reclaimed 13 mountains in heavy
fighting along the northern border and that an Iranian helicopter
was shot down there. Iran denied the claim, saying all its aircraft
returned safely.
   The National Liberation Army statement said the Mehran
offensive, named ``Forty Stars,'' was the largest operation
undertaken by its forces and involved 22 brigades of combat and
support troops and covered a front 30 miles wide.
   But the statement did not say how many troopers are in each
brigade or give an overall figure of the number of fighters
involved.
   The group, formed last June, is built around the Mujahedeen
Khalq (People's Warriors) that helped Khomeini overthrow Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. It later was outlawed by Khomeini's Islamic
fundamentalists and created a base in Baghdad.
   Members of the Mujadedeen Khalq describe themselves as Islamic
socialists seeking a secular regime in Iran.
   Supported by Iraq, the National Liberation Army has been playing
a small but growing role in the war. Western diplomats in Baghdad
put the number of the group's fighters at about 15,000.

   A woman who called her banker husband and said
she was being held for ransom at gunpoint was found shot to death
Sunday in a wooded area, authorities said.
   The body of Sally Weiner, 37, wife of Pennbank branch manager
Harry Weiner, was found by a farmer about 8 a.m. in a clearing
about about 100 yards off a dirt road and five miles northwest of
Corry, state police said.
   Her body, which was fully clothed, was taken to an Erie, Pa.,
hospital for an autopsy, said Erie County Coroner Merle Wood. He
said the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head.
   ``I would say she died instantly,'' Wood said.
   No information regarding the time of death or the kind of gun
used was released.
   Dozens of state and local police officers and FBI agents had
combed Erie County in northwest Pennsylvania for the woman since
Friday afternoon. That's when she told her husband she would be
killed if he didn't meet an unspecified ransom demand, said Thomas
Doolin, president of Erie-based Pennbank.
   State police Cpl. Harold Eberhardt said Sunday he could release
no other information other than that the body had been found.
   Doolin said Mrs. Weiner appeared to be reading a prepared
statement when she telephoned her husband, who runs Pennbank's
branch in Corry, a community of 7,100 people.
   ``She said they were holding a gun to her and that there was a
death threat,'' Doolin said Saturday. ``She said ... he would find
instructions on what to do in a paper bag in the parking lot
outside the bank.''
   Weiner was told to buy a walkie-talkie, set it at a certain
frequency, and go to an isolated, wooded area outside Corry at 9
p.m. Friday, Doolin said.
   ``We followed the instructions and went to the designated place,
and they were supposed to make contact and they never did,'' he
said.
   ``In one way this thing looks to be well organized and in
another way it looks amateurish. This is a tiny little branch
office in a tiny little community, so it's hard to figure out why
this has all taken place.''

   More than 3,000 people marched in downtown Tokyo
Sunday in the annual protest against the U.S.-Japan security treaty
that allows the United States to maintain military bases on
Japanese territory.
   Police reported 21 people were arrested. They said that was the
largest number of arrests in a demonstration against the treaty in
at least five years.
   Many of the protesters wore helmets and snake-danced through
downtown streets carrying banners that said: ``Scrap the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty.''
   The treaty, originally signed in 1952, allows the United States
to maintain military bases in Japan ``for the purpose of
contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of
international peace and security in the Far East.''
   It has been renewed on a year-to-year basis since 1970.

   Four divers claimed records for the
longest and deepest traverses of an underwater cave system Sunday
after emerging from an 8,440-foot limestone tunnel near where a
companion died in a preliminary dive.
   They surfaced several minutes after 5 p.m. EDT. They had spent
more than an hour breathing specially blended gases to decompress
from the journey that took them 240 feet beneath the surface of
Leon and Wakulla counties south of here.
   ``My lungs are a little scratchy from breathing all that
(oxygen). Other than that, I'm fine,'' said Parker Turner, director
of safety for the National Association for Cave Diving. ``It went
real smooth. But boy, if you had a problem, it would have been
distressing.''
   Turner, 36, ran into trouble almost immediately after starting
the dive four hours earlier in Sullivan Sink when his
high-intensity light short-circuited. He could have been stranded
in the lightless waters if not for a smaller backup and his
companions' beams.
   The previous record for the longest cave traverse was set by a
6,400-foot dive in Keld's Head, England, and the deepest cave
traverse was set during a 230-foot dive in the Sullivan system,
said Turner.
   The diving team had measured the 40 million-year-old Sullivan
tunnel system in January in separate dives by stringing lines from
each end, setting a record for connecting the longest underwater
cave. But the divers had not traversed the entire system in one
dive until Sunday.
   Aimed primarily at mapping the tunnels, collecting rock samples
and studying the caves' geologic structures, the expedition could
result in evidence linking the caves to underwater rivers that flow
into the Gulf of Mexico some 20 miles south.
   The caves are part of what is believed to be a 40,000-foot
system, which would make it the longest documented underwater
limestone cave system. The second-longest is the 36,000-foot
Lucayan tunnel beneath Grand Bahama island, said Lisa Burkett, the
diving team's publicist.
   Team member Bill McFaden, 32, died on May 15 while exploring the
Little Dismal Sinkhole. After exhausting his air, he floated upward
about 100 feet but developed an embolism while his partners tried
to maneuver him to safety through the system of caves.
   His companions had to abandon his body but it was recovered
later.
   Ms. Burkett estimated the cost of the expedition will be about
$8,000. That money will come from the divers and other private
sources, she said.

   Protesters burned the American flag and
caricatures of the seven world leaders attending the economic
summit Sunday, and police said more than 100 were arrested by the
time authorities cleared the streets.
   Some 2,000 demonstrators, carrying placards and colorfully
dressed, defied a police ban and attempted to march one mile from
the front of the provincial legislature to summit headquarters.
They shouted ``Arrest the G-7'' as they went, referring to the
summit group of seven countries.
   Their intent was to deliver a citizens' warrant for the arrest
of the seven leaders for alleged crimes against humanity.
   When police barricaded University Avenue, the broad thoroughfare
leading to the summit at Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center,
more than 60 demonstrators hurled themselves over crowd-control
barricades into the arms of tactical squad officers in dark blue
uniforms.
   The demonstrators espoused a host of causes ranging from
opposition to U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to urging
more help for victims of the deadly AIDS disease and saving the
rain forest.
   After they burned the caricatures, flag and three newspaper
boxes containing the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, busloads of
tactical squad officers linked arm to arm and rushed across the
intersection shouting ``move, move, move.'' They arrested those who
refused to clear the street.
   About 30 demonstrators sat on the road singing ``Give Peace a
Chance'' and flashing the peace sign. Phalanxes of police scooped
them up and dragged them away.
   Supporters shouted ``the world is watching'' as the dramatic
scenes, unprecedented in Toronto, developed.
   Police Supt. Bob Guay said when it was all over, at least 101
had been arrested and charged with breach of the peace.
   Organizer James Ensley of the Alliance for Non-Violent Action
said: ``I think people are showing today that its wrong for the
streets of Toronto to be shut just because seven people come to
town.''
   Protesters said they were seeking to dramatize their argument
that President Reagan and the six other world leaders have been
involved in militarism and economic policies that abandoned the
poor and the homeless.
   Reagan arrived here Sunday from Washington to begin a series of
talks with the leaders of Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and
Germany. The summit is the 14th annual gathering, designed to focus
primarily on international economic issues.
   Police had granted the protesters a permit for a rally, but
denied permission for them to march.
   A police superintendent told them through a loudspeaker, ``This
is an unlawful parade. Please disperse.''
   One protester shouted, ``These are our streets, man. This isn't
Russia.''
   Just outside a 15-foot-high chain link fence surrounding the
convention center, eight Japanese Buddhist monks wearing yellow
robes chanted for peace and pounded drums. They stood under a
banner calling for a new human consciousness of non-violence.
   Gisela Ramacher of West Germany said the protest was a ``special
prayer of peace for creating world peace and the victory of
non-violence.''

   Three West Germans were convicted of
smuggling Romanians to the West in the hidden compartment of a
truck for up to $12,000 each, a newspaper reported.
   The town court of Gyoer in northeastern Hungary sentenced
Siegfried Schwanke of Solingen, West Germany, to five years for
smuggling at least 20 people, mostly ethnic Germans, from Romania
to West Germany, the Magyar Nemzet said in its weekend edition.
   Roland Botschner and Heinz Christoph Dewenter received suspended
sentences of one year and eight months.
   The three belonged to a smuggling ring run by Hungarian-born
West German Ferenc Garbacz, who never went to Hungary. Ten other
West Germans were known to have worked for him, the paper said.
   The daily said Garbacz offered to smuggle relatives of people
settled in West Germany out of Romania for a fee of between $6,000
and $12,000.
   The West German smugglers met their clients in Hungary where the
Romanians had traveled as tourists, and then smuggled them in the
hidden compartment of a truck across the Hungarian-Austrian border
at Hegyeshalom, usually on Saturday or Sunday evenings when border
traffic is heavy, the paper said.

<HEAD>Summit Agrees In Principle To African Debt Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's seven richest countries agreed Sunday
in principal to grant wide-ranging debt relief measures to the
poorest countries of Africa, officials reported after the economic
summit's opening session.
   A British official, saying the United States had softened its
position, said the leaders reached a ``general agreement to
action'' based on a mixture of write-offs of loans, rescheduling of
debt and concessionary interest rates.
   ``The Americans at this summit have shown they are willing to go
further than they had previously,'' said an aide to British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Canada, the host, said the leaders of the United States,
Britain, France, Italy, West Germany and Japan had agreed they have
a responsibility to developing nations to find a solution to the
overwhelming debt problem.
   The British official said the summit leaders will send a ``very
strong signal'' to the Paris Club of Western creditor nations ``to
allow relief in these ways.''
   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the final
communique will show ``clearly the direction we feel we should go
... and will provide industrialized countries, members of the Paris
Club, with flexibility.''
   The British official said the leaders' agreement meant that
creditor nations could choose from a menu of options outlined in
separate, but overlapping initiatives, put forward by Lawson,
Britain's top financial official, and French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The British plan, first put forward and rejected a year ago by
most major creditor nations, called for a three-pronged approach of
write-offs, rescheduling and concessionary interest rates. The
French proposal allows creditor nations a choice of options.
   Before the summit, Lawson said in London that the American
attitude to Third World debt relief was inadequate.
   The United States has said it cannot legally write-off loans or
grant concessionary interest rates, but can grant extended interest
repayment periods.
   The Third World debt issue dominated Sunday's discussions by the
seven finance ministers meeting separately, and also apparently was
a major topic in the talks among the heads of government.
   French officials quoted Mitterrand as saying, ``the poverty of
the Third World destroys their societies and threatens ours.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in an otherwise
upbeat speech that the poorest countries ``are not sharing in world
economic success and we must do something to help them.''
   The reported consensus means that each country can choose relief
measures that do not conflict with its laws on write-offs and
special interest rates. Fears that differing regulations in
creditor countries would mean some nations paying a much heavier
price than others to help the poorest have helped block previous
attempts at agreement.
   There was no word on any new initiative to help the
middle-income debtor nations, mainly Latin American countries,
which owe by far the most, but are not as badly off as the poorest
nations _ the countries of Africa below the Sahara desert.
   The debt of the poorest African countries totals around 85
billion dollars, a small fraction of the $1 trillion debt owed by
all Third World countries.

   Violence during a nationwide strike by
private bus and truck drivers has injured at least 130 people and
damaged more than 100 vehicles, police said Sunday.
   Members of the Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation
walked off the job Friday to protest a proposal to increase from
five to 25 years, the jail term for anyone convicted of killing
people in traffic accidents.
   An average of two people are killed every day in traffic
accidents in Bangladesh.
   Nearly 100 people were hurt and 20 arrested Saturday when
striking drivers attacked state-run buses and other vehicles with
small bombs and scuffled with non-striking workers, police said.
   On Friday, 30 people were injured and 100 arrested, police said.
Fifty vehicles including passenger buses were damaged.
   The violence Friday and Saturday centered on Dhaka and
neighboring areas. There were no reports of violence Sunday.
   Salahuddin Ahmed, leader of the transport workers' federation,
said about 30,000 buses, minibuses and three-wheeled motor-scooter
taxis stayed off the streets. The job action also idled an unknown
number of freight-hauling trucks.

   Sioux medicine man Leonard Crow Dog, using an
eagle bone whistle and peace pipe, tried to summon rain Sunday for
this drought-stricken community.
   ``Four days from now, there's going to be thundering, lightning,
rain,'' Crow Dog said after performing a 30-minute Sioux ritual
that he says has never failed to bring rain.
   Cliff Doebel of rural Sandusky County, who owns a greenhouse and
plant nursery, paid $2,000 to bring Crow Dog and eight other
Indians from the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
   This northern Ohio town has received one-third of an inch of
rain in the past month. And the five-day National Weather Service
forecast held no chance of showers or thunderstorms until Friday.
   ``Without water, there is no life; without the direction of the
wind, there is no breathing,'' Crow Dog said. ``The Thunder Being
knows when there needs to be rain.''
   Crow Dog, 49, said his first rain ceremony was in 1953 when he
participated with his grandfather. He said he has done 126
ceremonies since then, all of which have been successful.
   Although Crow Dog performed no dance at the ceremony, the Red
Eagles, a Columbus, Ohio,-based Indian organization, performed
several folk dances unrelated to the rain ritual. The group also
chanted and played drums while Crow Dog, assisted by Sioux Indian
Chuck Grignon, blew a whistle toward the north, south, east and
west, toward the sky and toward the ground.
   ``We blow to the four winds, to the creator and Mother Earth,''
Crow Dog explained.
   The Sioux tribesmen who were to assist Crow Dog had car trouble
and arrived after Sunday's ceremony had ended, but they will assist
him in rituals to be held each day through Wednesday.
   Many of those in the crowd were dubious about Crow Dog's
rain-making claims, but said they were willing to try any solution
to end the drought.
   ``They pray by dancing, we pray by going to church. It's the
same God,'' said Mary Lou Noftz, one of the spectators.

<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 people returned home
Sunday after a two-day evacuation of neighborhoods choked by toxic
fumes from a chemical plant fire that sent 275 people to the
hospital.
   But 4,600 residents were barred from returning to their
neighborhood near the smoldering factory that continued to flare up
and spew deadly yellow-green gas. The plant makes chloride pellets
for swimming pools.
   Authorities said they would wait until Monday to pour 52 tons of
neutralizing chemicals on the remaining chloride. Firefighters
continued pumping water on the remains of the Advanced Laboratories
plant.
   The neighborhood around the plant was kept closed because small
explosions continued throughout Sunday. Anyone entering the area
was subject to arrest, officials said.
   ``I understand the difficulty of the inconvenience for the 1,800
homes involved ... but we think it's absolutely necessary to
conduct ourselves in a prudent manner,'' said Kevin Kennedy, an
aide to Springfield Mayor Richard Neal.
   Two schools, two housing projects for the elderly and a nursing
home remained off limits. Evacuees stayed for the third straight
night in city shelters.
   ``I'm miserable, inconvenienced, sweaty, hot, uncomfortable and
I want to go home,'' said Shellie Spencer Jr., 30, from his cot at
Municipal Hospital where he and his family stayed since early
Saturday.
   The last of the three weekend fires at the plant was finally
brought under control about 6 a.m. Sunday after a huge chlorine gas
cloud moved over this city of 170,000 people and forced the
evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 residents from Springfield and
neighboring Chicopee.
   The corrosive fumes also sent 275 people, including 22
firefighters, to area hospitals with complaints of skin burns and
breathing problems, but only two residents were admitted, both with
respiratory problems. They were reported in stable condition Sunday.
   ``This is the worst public health and environmental disaster in
the 20 years I've been here,'' said John J. Higgins, regional
director of the state Department of Environmental Quality
Engineering.
   Fire Chief Raymond Sullivan called the blaze the largest in
memory and Kennedy said the disaster would cost the city millions
of dollars.
   The fires began when rain blew in a window in the two-story
factory and reacted with chlorine tablets in a hopper. The heat
from the reaction started a blaze at the pre-Civil War factory,
authorities said.
   The fire was quickly extinguished, but another began just before
midnight Friday about 30 feet away. Investigators initially
speculated that the sprinkler system that dumped 4 inches of water
in the plant started the second blaze, but then ruled that out.
   That fire appeared under control by noon Saturday, and 6,000
evacuees began returning to home. But water-soaked barrels of
chlorine exploded, throwing two firefighters against a wall and
prompting the extensive evacuation.
   The last fire was brought under control about dawn Sunday after
sending a huge gas cloud over the city of 170,000 people.
   Chlorine is used in diluted form for bleaching clothes and
cleaning swimming pools but is deadly in its pure, gaseous form.
   At the core of the fire was a room containing 600 to 800
barrels, each filled with 300 pounds of granulated chlorine that
was 85 percent pure.
   Firefighters pumped 14,000 pounds of water per minute in an
attempt to turn the plant ``into a big swimming pool,'' according
to Fire Department spokesman Giorgio Placanico. More than 50 tons
of sodium sulfate and boric acid were then mixed to pour on the
chloride in hopes of turning it into harmless table salt.
   Some of the chemicals were flown in overnight from Maine in
response to a plea from the Fire Department, but officials said it
wasn't enough. ``We don't have anything near the amount needed to
neutralize it,'' said Higgins.
   Although they risked reigniting the chloride, firefighters said
they needed to control the fire and dissipate the gas cloud with
water. ``If allowed to go on, the cloud would have stayed for
weeks,'' said Sullivan.
   At its height, the gas cloud measured two miles long and four
blocks wide and it drifted with changing winds. Its fumes could be
smelled as far as Palmer, 15 miles to the east.
   The cloud forced police and fire officials to move their command
post a half-dozen times, once at the order of panicked officers
yelling ``Get out of here!'' as the cloud rolled up the street.
   Police twice invoked emergency powers to forcibly remove elderly
tenants who refused to leave, according to Kevin Sullivan, an aide
to Neal.

<HEAD>Diplomat To Washington For Compromise Talks on Beach Strip</HEAD>

   A leading Israeli diplomat will travel to
Washington this week for renewed efforts to settle a dispute with
Egypt over a strip of desert beach held by Israel, a Foreign
Ministry official said Sunday.
   The controversy over Taba, a 250-acre strip of land that
includes a beach resort, dates to 1982 when Israel relinquished the
bulk of the peninsula to Egypt in keeping with a 1979 peace treaty.
Both countries claimed the tiny enclave.
   In 1986 both countries agreed to send the issue to a panel of
international arbitrators, which was expected to announce a
decision this summer.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and two top ministers decided Sunday to send Ronnie Sabel,
legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry, to Washington this week to
discuss the issue with American and Egyptian officials.
   The official said Israel agreed to negotiate a compromise
because Egypt dropped a condition that Israel acknowledge Egypt's
right to the beach.
   Israel radio said the compromise negotiations would take the
place of the arbitration by the five-member panel.
   But Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismat Abdel-Meguid appeared to
contradict the Israeli version when he told reporters Saturday in
Cairo that his country would accept the arbitration decision.
   The Israeli daily Davar reported last week that the arbitrators
would rule in Egypt's favor. Israeli officials refused to comment
on the report.

   Amid extraordinary security, leaders of the
world's seven richest nations opened an economic summit Sunday,
expressing ``confidence and optimism'' about the future but still
firmly at odds over President Reagan's push to abolish farm
subsidies.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the host of the 14th
annual summit of industrialized nations, described the first
session as a ``productive and spontaneous discussion'' and said
there was ``a vigorous and comprehensive review of major concerns''
of the leaders.
   Indeed, the meeting lasted 45 minutes beyond the two hours
planned.
   ``We just had a lot of things to talk about,'' Reagan said later
as he posed for pictures on the lakefront lawn of a country club
with the six other leaders.
   He said they talked both about foreign policy and economic
issues, and that reducing agricultural subsidies was still on the
agenda. ``Believe me, it's going to be discussed,'' Reagan said.
   A 3,000-person security force was deployed on the ground, on
rooftops, in boats and in helicopters to protect the leaders as
they conferred in a windowless, underground room in a convention
center, sealed off by concrete barriers and a high chain-link fence.
   Reflecting the high level of caution, a ``red alert'' was
declared as Reagan's motorcade took him from the airport to
downtown, causing his armored limousine to slow noticeably. White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater explained later that security
forces had spotted a man carrying a bag marked ``ammunition'' _ but
that it merely contained his lunch.
   Many demonstrators defied police orders and tried to march to
the summit compound, carrying a ``warrant for the arrest'' of the
leaders. More than 100 protesters were arrested by the time
authorities finally cleared the streets.
   The meeting, the 14th annual summit, brought together the
leaders of the United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy and Canada.
   Mulroney's statement, issued on behalf of all the leaders and
read by Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said, ``We feel we
have made real progress in recent years. Our message is and should
be one of confidence and optimism in dealing with the challenges
confronting us.''
   Injecting a note of caution, the statement said. ``The leaders
agreed there is no room for complacency. Difficult problems
remain.''
   With the world economy in good shape, there were no problems
requiring immediate answers. No dramatic initiatives or
breakthroughs were expected, and the biggest threat to an
argument-free meeting was the volatile issue of agricultural
subsidies.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, usually an ideological
soulmate of Reagan's, said the president's plan to abolish all
agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 was ``very courageous but
not very realistic,'' according to Hubert Vedrine, a spokesman for
French President Francois Mitterrand, who opposes Reagan's idea.
   Vedrine said Mrs. Thatcher gave ``a long and vigorous
criticism'' of the subsidies and said they could ``ruin our
economies.'' Reagan said there was no simple answer and that ``we
all subsidize,'' Vedrine said.
   The agricultural subsidies, which cost major industrialized
countries upwards of $200 billion a year, are extremely popular
with farmers. European negotiators have said they would be willing
to talk about cutting them, but not abolishing them.
   Reagan has indicated the dispute could wait till the end of the
year, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged the
idea was going nowhere here.
   ``We realize it will not be resolved at this summit, nor do we
expect any sweeping conclusions or admonitions or directions on
agriculture to come out of the summit,'' he said. ``But we do want
to begin building the internal political and social pressure for
change in this area.''
   On another subject, the leaders also discussed the overwhelming
debt problem of the poorest nations in Africa. A British official
said they agreed in principle to a mixture of proposals involving
both loan writeoffs, rescheduling and concessionary interest rates.
   After economic discussions at the afternoon session, the leaders
were free to delve into political subjects over dinner at a country
club. Fitzwater said he expected Reagan would discuss his recent
summit in Moscow with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The spokesman also said the summit would produce a statement on
East-West relations, stressing the importance of strength and unity
among U.S. allies.
   Summing up the talks, Reagan told reporters that it was
``fine.'' Mrs. Thatcher agreed, saying all had gone ``very well.''
   Fitzwater said that Reagan suggested to new summit participants
that the meeting be on a first-name basis, and added, ``My name is
Ron.''
   Wilson said the leaders agreed that ``our countries must develop
further our economic coordination efforts. Sound policies must be
continued.''
   Specifically, he said, ``The response to the Oct. 19 (Wall
Street) stock market crisis, and the better-than-expected
performance of the world economy since then show just how far this
cooperation has developed and succeeded.''
   On trade, Wilson said, they all agreed to resist protectionism
and to insure that a midterm review in Montreal gives a strong
signal of progress.
   Unlike many earlier summits, there were no foreign policy issues
or outside matters likely to dominate the agenda, as the Persian
Gulf war did last year in Venice and terrorism did a year earlier
in Japan.
   Each of the vistors was welcomed one-by-one earlier at a
ceremony featuring the honor guard of the 48th Highlanders militia,
clad in kilts and black bonnets and playing bagpipes and drums.
   Behind the pageantry, there were ever-present reminders of
concern about possible terrorism.
   Many demonstrators hurled themselves over the barricades and
into the arms of blue-suited police tactical squad officers. The
fracas took place a mile from the place where the leaders were
holding their first round of formal talks.
   The demonstrators, dressed in colorful garb, espoused a host of
causes ranging from opposition to U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels to urging more help for victims of the deadly AIDS disease.
   Outside the fence, eight Japanese Buddhist monks in yellow robes
chanted for peace and pounded drums under a banner calling for a
new human consciousness of non-violence.
   Security fears were underscored by the arrest of Michael Derrick
Collins, suspected of being a low-key Irish Republican Army
operative, on charges of overstaying his visa. Collins, 31, is
being sought by authorities in British-run Northern Ireland,
according to a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher.
   Under rules of protocol, Reagan, the longest-serving head of
state, was the last to arrive at the official welcoming ceremonies.
The first was Jacques De Lors, president of the European Economic
Community, followed by Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Mrs. Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Reagan.
   Reagan and Mitterrand met for 35 minutes in a downtown hotel
just before the first session, discussing disarmament and the
challenge of improving education in their countries, said Vedrine
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher apologized to Kohl for the hooligan behavior of
British soccer spectators in West Germany and urged stiff jail
sentences, officials said.

   When ``The Grand Tour,'' a musical based on S.N.
Behrman's play ``Jacobowsky and the Colonel,'' opened on Broadway
in 1979, it was overproduced and undernourished.
   The story of the friendship between a likable, ever-resourceful
Jew and an aristocratic, anti-Semitic Polish army officer often was
swallowed up by the show's lavish production. How could it compete
with a full-scale automobile that trundled across the stage,
singing nuns, an elaborate railroad car, a chorus of exuberant
Hasidim, a gargantuan flag of Poland that served as the focal point
of a big dance number, and a colorful circus scene? The show died
in two months.
   Now a streamlined and much simpler version of ``The Grand Tour''
has opened at off-Broadway's Jewish Repertory Theater. The result
is an absolute delight, a show brimming with tuneful songs and a
touching, funny and immensely human story that is finally allowed
to shine. It's a joyful revival, on par with last season's engaging
resurrection of ``Flora, The Red Menace,'' another musical
obscurity.
   The transformation in ``The Grand Tour'' from more to less has
been startling. Director Ran Avni makes do with two wooden
turntables for the set designed by Jeffrey Schneider. Gone are the
nuns and the Polish flag. The automobile is conjured out of a few
pieces of wood and a turntable. The circus atmosphere has been
reduced to a few colored pennants.
   What expands into this spartan atmosphere is the plot and
characters. Jacobowsky and the colonel band together to flee the
Nazis as they advance through the French countryside in 1940. They
are accompanied by the colonel's French girlfriend who inevitably
becomes the focal point in a love triangle.
   The revival, with a revised book by Michael Stewart and Mark
Bramble, puts these three people back in focus. The story of their
journey to freedom is important but it doesn't surplant their
growing affection for each other.
   That affection is expressed in Herman's music which piles melody
on top of melody. It's a dizzying display of song. The evening
starts with Jacobowsky's entrance number, ``I'll Be Here
Tomorrow,'' a survivor's song worthy of Dolly Levi or Mame Dennis.
But there are several other number, particularly ``Marianne,'' a
haunting love song for the colonel, and ``I Belong Here,''
Marianne's hymn to home, that deserve to be heard again.
   Joel Grey was the original Jacobowsky in ``The Grand Tour.''
Stuart Zagnit is his worthy successor here. It's a performance that
straddles a very difficult line. Zagnit is able to be appealing
without descending into cloying cuteness. And he's got one of those
terrific musical comedy voices that makes every lyric count.
   Zagnit has a worthy opponent _ and finally _ friend in Paul
Ukena Jr., who turns the colonel into someone more than a buffoon.
Patricia Ben Peterson, who plays Marianne, manages to make the
woman into more than a bone of contention between the two men.
   The show succeeds this time around because it has taken the
trouble to care about its characters. And now, so does the
audience. ``The Grand Tour'' is a grand musical comedy, a worthy
journey for anyone to take.

   Barges got moving Sunday in new channels cut in the shrinking
Ohio and Mississippi rivers, but rain on the upper Mississippi
Valley did little to ease the drought that has withered wheat and
seedling Christmas trees alike.
   An Ohio newspaper columnist offered Sunday to print the names of
Akron's worst water wasters.
   ``I keep hearing from farmers about how bad it was in '36, '53
and '54,'' said James Craig Wood, 33, who farms near Westfield,
Ind. ``But it's the driest I've ever seen.''
   ``Each week without rain we lose 10 percent of the crops,'' said
Tim Shank, spokesman for the Ohio Grain and Feed Association.
   Lee Jones, who lives west of Bloomington, Ind., found that her
200-foot well had gone dry _ leaving her no water for her 8{ acres
of herbs, vegetables and fruit. ``We're very lucky to be members of
the Y so we can go there for showers,'' she said.
   In Washington, D.C., Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., proposed Sunday
that Commodity Credit Corp. and Agriculture Credit Insurance Fund
money, usually used for loans, be made available for disaster
relief and to supplement federal crop insurance.
   ``The rapidly worsening drought situation mandates Congress to
move quickly to complete some reasonable assistance package which
will help producers who are on the brink of financial ruin and
mental distress,'' Marlenee said. ``It would be cruel and unfair
for us not to act now.''
   Showers and thunderstorms moved across sections of Minnesota and
Wisconsin overnight, pouring 1.72 inches of rain in 24 hours on
Duluth, Minn. But Minnesota's driest farms are on the opposite side
of the state, which got only spotty rain.
   Even if hard rain had fallen in the farming regions, much of it
would have rolled off because the ground is too dry, said
meteorologist Rainer Dombrowsky.
   Limited barge traffic resumed late Saturday on the Mississippi
River near Greenville, Miss., and on the Ohio River near Mound
City, Ill., and moved slowly Sunday.
   Both rivers have been dwindling because of the lack of rain in
the Midwest and northern Plains. The lower Mississippi is at its
lowest level since the start of record keeping in 1872.
   An estimated 1,800 barges had been backed up on the Mississippi
waiting for dredges to cut a channel through a shallow area, and
nearly 700 barges were stuck on the Ohio. Bob Campbell, assistant
chief of operations for the Army Corps of Engineers' Vicksburg
District, said it would take two to three days to unsnarl traffic
along the Mississippi.
   The Mississippi was closed during the night north of Memphis,
Tenn., because a towboat ran aground in the dark.
   ``Dredging continues,'' said Bill Schult of the Corps of
Engineers. ``It's like fighting scattered fires now.''
   Stuart Warner, a columnist for The Akron Beacon Journal in Ohio,
offered readers a coupon to clip out of Sunday's newspaper with
which to report people who waste water.
   ``They shower every day. Alone. Their cars are clean. Their
lawns are green. These big drips must be stopped,'' Warner wrote.
He said he would publish the names of worst water wasters.
   By Sunday, one day after the ordinance was passed, water service
to seven households had been shut off in the Chicago suburb of Oak
Brook because they had broken water restrictions more than once,
Village Manager Stephen Berley said Sunday. He said four had paid
the $200 fee required to get back service.
   Rain fell on Mississippi during the weekend, but it was too
little and mostly in the wrong place to save parched crops. State
Agricultgure Commissioner Jim Buck led a prayer ceremony for rain
Sunday in Jackson.
   The drought could affect Christmas observances years from now.
Steve Latzig of Badger Evergreens at Merrill, Wis., estimated the
operation has lost 2 percent of its new trees and could begin
losing 1 percent a day this week if no rain comes.
   The drought could cost North Dakota tens of millions of dollars
in tax revenue, a state budget forecaster said. That would
virtually wipe out any chance of triggering pay raises for state
workers on Jan. 1, and could be severe enough to force spending
cuts, said Dave Clark, executive budget analyst.
   Last week, North Dakota State University economist Arlen Leholm
predicted the drought would cost the state's economy at least $2.7
billion through loss of crops, lower federal farm subsidies and
reduced farm spending. Clark said at least 40 percent of the
state's wheat crop has been wiped out.

   Japan and the United States signed an agreement
Monday to end the dispute over Japanese imports of U.S. beef and
oranges, officials said.
   The agreement was signed by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Takashi
Sato, said ministry sources. They refused to discuss details of the
accord.
   Japanese television showed the two men signing the pact and
shaking hands.
   A commentary carried with the program by Japan Broadcasting
Corp. said the basic agreement calls for Japan to liberalize its
imports of U.S. beef and oranges after three years and orange juice
in four years.
   Japan would be allowed to implement emergency import
restrictions after liberalization gets under way, according to the
television report.
   As part of the accord, the United States agreed to withdraw a
complaint filed with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the sources said.
   U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment on the reports.

<TEXT>
   For three men and their families the best Father's
Day present was meeting their newly adopted children Sunday after a
congressman cut through eight months of frustration and
bureaucratic delays.
   The four children from the Dominican Republic _ ages 16 months,
5, 7, and 9 years old _ entered the United States on probationary
visas after Rep. William Lehman, D-Fla., intervened for the parents
and adoption agency.
   Lehman blamed the delay on the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service misinterpretating a 1986 law dealing with
U.S. servicemen adopting sons and daughters born out of wedlock in
Southeast Asia.
   The INS said it was only following the law.
   In the meantime, the four children were living in foster homes,
and most of the adoption paperwork was completed.
   After months of appealing to INS administrators, Lehman received
permission to bring the children into the country on rarely granted
humanitarian parole.
   ``I think the INS is like many government agencies in enforcing
technicalities beyond their intent,'' Lehman said while waiting for
the children's arrival.
   Added Dianne Racheleau-Malaret, new mother of the youngest
child, ``I've dealt with bureaucracies before, but this is
ridiculous.''
   The 5- and 7-year-olds are a brother and sister adopted by the
same family. A third family adopted the 9-year-old.
   Lorri Kellogg, executive director of the Miami-based Universal
Aid for Children adoption agency, accompanied the children from the
Dominican Republic.
   ``The bureaucracy has to show a little more sensitivity,'' she
said.

   A crewman stabbed on the Queen

and police detectives boarded the QE 2 to investigate, authorities
said.
   The Filipino crewman, who was in his 30s, was taken by a Royal
Air Force helicopter to a Plymouth hospital where he was in stable
condition, police Constable Adrian Gale said in an interview. He
did not identify the victim.
   A Royal Air Force spokesman, who was not identified in keeping

   Five detectives boarded the ship and would remain aboard as it
sailed from Plymouth to Southampton, southwest of London, Gale said.
   He said he did not know where the QE2 had sailed from before
entering Plymouth Sound and the offices of Cunard, the vessel's
owner, were closed.
   Gale said the 67,000-ton ship paused in Plymouth Sound outside
the port while the crewman was taken off.

   Amid extraordinary security and some arrests,
leaders of the world's seven richest nations opened an economic
summit Sunday billed as a showcase of harmony and a farewell to
President Reagan.
   With the world economy in good shape, there were no problems
requiring immediate answers. No dramatic initiatives or

argument-free meeting was the volatile issue of agricultural
subsidies.
   However, Reagan signaled that he would not press his case for
ending all subsidies by the year 2000, instead letting the issue
slide until the end of the year. ``We're going to meet and discuss
all of these things,'' Reagan said as he sat at an octagonal table
at the opening round of the three days of talks.

   Thousands of journalists brushed up on
international economics, pored over the words of world leaders and
searched Sunday for a new angle on what has become an old story _
the annual economic summit of industrialized democracies.
   ``With the possible exception of royal visits, economic summits
are the most over-covered non-events on the media calendar,'' wrote
columnist Jeffrey Simpson in the Toronto Globe and Mail.
   Bob Asman, executive producer of NBC News, said the summits
``have become so institutionalized'' that they tend ``to be routine
and routine things aren't news.''
   Moreover, this year's gathering is expected to be low key.
   President Reagan, one of the seven world leaders at the meeting,
is a lame-duck with only seven months remaining in his term.
   In addition, the world economy is showing few trouble signs.

   The investigation of alleged bribery and fraud
in Pentagon weapons-buying shows the ``good old boy network'' in
the Reagan administration was more worried about winning huge
defense budgets than about making sure the government spent its
money wisely, four key legislators said Sunday.
   Meantime, President Reagan, attending a summit meeting of the
leaders of western democracies in Toronto, refused to comment on
news reports that former Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. may have
warned his long-time ally, military consultant Melvyn Paisley, that
Paisley was under investigation.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the Pentagon has had ``a serious management problem

   The Cabinet said Sunday it will force Soviet
Jews emigrating with Israeli visas to travel directly from the
Eastern bloc to the Jewish state to prevent them from settling
elsewhere.
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said the decision appeared to
contradict the United States' position supporting freedom of travel
for Soviet Jews.
   Emigration activists said the decision may reduce the influx of
Soviet Jews to Israel.
   The Cabinet said in a statement that it ``decided to act, in the
framework of legal means available, that Jews who ask for an exit
visa from the Soviet Union in order to come to Israel would indeed
reach Israel directly.''
   Israeli officials say the decision is aimed at boosting Soviet
Jewish immigration and reducing the number of ``dropouts'' _ Jews
who prefer to go to the United States and other Western countries
instead of Israel.

in the rivers, lakes and wells that provide drinking water and
recreation.
   Millions of streams and rivers across the nation carry off
sewage, industrial wastes, agricultural chemicals and other
pollutants. Some people describe the process with the rhyme: ``The
solution to pollution is dilution.''
   ``Just common sense would tell you that if you have less flow in

   A combination of national politics and Capitol

   Wright wants the House ethics committee, which announced it is
examining six possible violations of House rules by the Texas
Democrat, to quickly dispose of the case.
   But the committee is under pressure from Republicans to hire
outside counsel _ even though it is the only panel in the House
where Republicans hold the same number of votes as Democrats.
   Sources familiar with the panel's thinking say the case against
Wright is not considered strong, but members are determined to
avoid charges of a ``whitewash.'' If an outside counsel is brought
in, the earliest a finding could be made would be September, said
one source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

   Pope John Paul II canonized 117 martyrs from
Vietnam on Sunday in an event that drew thousands of Vietnamese
refugees from around the world and irked that country's Communist
authorities.
   The Hanoi government had said that it wasn't against the
canonization _ the largest in Roman Catholic history _ but it
charged that Vietnamese emigrants seized on the occasion to make
anti-communist declarations.
   An estimated 8,000 Vietnamese, some of them ``boat people'' who
fled Vietnam since 1975, were among the 20,000 people who attended
the canonization Mass in St. Peter's Square.
   They later staged reunions in nearby restaurants or ate rice,

   The army Sunday closed three Arab schools where
student protests have erupted, and a spokesman for Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said Rabin had met with Palestinian leaders in an
effort to resolve the uprising.
   ``He's trying to create a dialogue, to ask what is happening and
about the future, what they suggest'' as solutions, spokesman Eitan
Haber said. He would not elaborate.
   Haber would not say where or when the meetings had taken place.
   The daily Haaretz reported that the defense minister recently
met with an author of the Palestinian National Charter, a platform
of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The report did not name
the Palestinian or give the date of the meeting.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Rabin decided against publishing the names of the Palestinian
leaders who met him, fearing they could be assassinated.

   Sens. Patrick J. Leahy and Strom Thurmond have
been locked in a partisan snit for months over the pace of
judgeship confirmations, and last week, the feud just about reached
the boiling point.
   The two met privately, senator-to-senator, in an anteroom
outside a committee room as staffers outside the door could hear _
as one described it _ ``the decibel level rise.''
   The trouble began in the opening moments of a hearing for a
judicial nominee from California, when Thurmond, R-S.C., asked that
testimony get under way.
   Leahy, a liberal Democrat from Vermont, who was presiding, chose
instead to read his entire single-spaced, 10-page letter to
Thurmond, denying that Democrats were stalling President Reagan's
court nominees.
