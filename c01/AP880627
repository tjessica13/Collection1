   The State Department on Monday called for full
cooperation from Egypt in an investigation into an alleged scheme
to illegally export U.S. technology to the Middle Eastern country.
   An Egyptian army colonel stationed in Washington was one of five
people charged in the case last Friday.
   ``We take violations of our laws very seriously,'' Charles E.
Redman, the State Department spokesman, said.
   Federal authorities alleged a conspiracy to export the chemical
carbon-carbon, which is used to make missile nose cones and stealth
aircraft less visible to radar. Lt. Col. Mohammed Abdella Mohammed,
who was assigned to the Egyptian embassy in Washington, was
arrested in Baltimore and then released after claiming diplomatic
immunity.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that Mohammed
and another Egyptian military procurement official, Adm. Abdel
Rahim Elgohary, had been called home by Egypt in the wake of the
charges and that the two returned to Cairo last weekend.
   Citing an Egyptian source it did not identify, the Post said the
two would help authorities in Cairo ``carry out the necessary
investigation.'' Although Elgohary was not charged in the case, the
Customs Service mentioned him in an affidavit as having played a
role.
   It was not immediately known if the two would return to the
United States, the newspaper said.
   Redman said U.S. diplomats had discussed the case with Egyptian
officials since last Friday. ``We expect full cooperation,'' he
said.
   Otherwise, the spokesman declined comment on the substance of
the case.

<HEAD>Rebels Reject Meeting with Sandinistas in Miami</HEAD>

   Nicaragua's rebels on Monday rejected
a proposal by the leftist Sandinista government to meet in Miami to
resume stalled peace talks, but said they would maintain a
cease-fire indefinitely.
   The U.S.-supported rebels, called Contras, proposed that future
peace talks be held outside Nicaragua and that President Daniel
Ortega head the government delegation.
   A statement issued in Miami by the directorate of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, said the rebels set no
deadline for ending the cease-fire and charged ``the Sandinista
regime is the one that has signaled a deadline.''
   A truce that went into effect on March 21 and expired at the end
of May was unilateraly extended for 30 days by the Sandinistas.
That extension puts the truce deadline at June 30.
   Peace talks between the government and the rebels reached an
impasse this month over differences on democratic reforms and a
timetable for the rebels to lay down their weapons.
   The last round of negotiations broke off without agreement on
June 9.
   The government proposed that a new round be held this week in
Managua. The Contras refused, saying the capital didn't have a
``favorable atmosphere'' for negotiations because the government
wanted to put too many restrictions on rebel negotiators.
   The government then suggested a preparatory meeting be held
Tuesday and Wednesday in Miami to discuss the agenda for the next
high-level negotiating session.
   The rebel letter issued Monday was signed by directorate member
Roberto Ferrey and directed to Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
the president's brother, who headed the government team in previous
negotiating sessions.
   ``A new high-level meeting should take place to overcome the
evident lack of political will of the Sandinista government in
complying'' with a Central American peace plan signed by the
region's five presidents last August, the statement said.
   That plan, authored by Costa Rica's President Oscar Arnulfo
Arias, called for negotiations aimed at ending civil wars in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. Arias won the Nobel Peace
Prize last year for sponsoring the plan.
   The Contra letter also said any new round of talks would have to
take place in another Central American country and called on
President Ortega to head the government negotiating team.
   It said any agreement reached would have to be guaranteed by the
presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.
   The letter to Gen. Ortega said the meeting could not take place
in Nicaragua because of ``threats, even those you have made
personally, and insults made in the Sandinista communications media
against the Nicaraguan Resistance delegation.''
   President Ortega said in Havana, Cuba, on Monday that his
government will keep ``searching (for) a negotiated solution to the
conflict that the United States has imposed upon us.'' He is in
Cuba on a state visit.

   The marks of battle cover trees and
telephone poles in this small town _ signs of cows with prison
stripes on them, stickers that say only ``Never.''
   It's all part of New Braintree's five-year fight to keep a
medium-security state prison from being located among its dairy
farms, a fight that now includes a federal investigation of how the
administration of Gov. Michael Dukakis chose the site.
   In this rural hamlet, where the 2,000-head dairy herd is more
than double the population, the cow dictates the pace of life.
Patrons fill the small general store for breakfast after the
morning milking; people avoid the road in front of town hall when
the cows cross from the fields in midafternoon.
   The residents' protest, which confronted Dukakis at a campaign
stop in Iowa last year, gained momentum last week with revelations
of an FBI investigation.
   However, Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, is
not a subject of the investigation, the FBI stressed.
   ``There are still some people in town who believe you can't
fight the state,'' said Susan Reed, co-owner of Reed's Country
Store, the only commercial establishment in New Braintree, about 60
miles west of Boston. ``But we're proving them wrong.''
   The town meeting last month narrowly approved $100,000, nearly
one-fifth of the town's annual budget, to fight the prison plan.
   ``Now it's much more of a horse race,'' said Dorothea
Thomas-Vitrac, a town selectman and a leader of Conserve Our Small
Town. ``They outweigh us in raw power, but we balance them in
people power. I think our horse is a little ahead now.''
   Nearing the fifth year of their fight, COST members and
supporters claim the proposal to transform the former Pioneer
Valley Academy campus into a 500-bed, medium-security prison would
irreversibly alter life in New Braintree, which has no municipal
water system and a part-time police chief.
   COST, relying on donations and profits from from bake sales, has
hired an attorney to seek a court injunction against the prison and
press for release of all related state documents.
   COST has questioned links between the owners of the school site
and Dukakis. The state has appraised the 784-acre school site at
$8.7 million, although a development firm owned by Daniel Striar
and Gary Jacobson purchased the land from the Seventh-day Adventist
Church for about $3 million in December 1985. Jacobson is a boyhood
friend of Dukakis and gave $1,000 to his presidential campaign.
   Dukakis administration officials maintain there are no
improprieties and claim New Braintree would be the most appropriate
location for a prison in Massachusetts, which has one of the
nation's most overcrowded penal systems.
   But the disclosure of the FBI investigation has elevated hopes
here that Dukakis may abandon the prison plan to avoid campaign
controversy.
   ``I don't think the governor wants to take this baggage around
with him on the way to the White House,'' Selectman Steve Cronin,
64, said Friday.
   ``It's not a political fight,'' said Thomas-Vitrac, who followed
Dukakis to a campaign stop in Osceola, Iowa, in February 1987. She
said she also spoke with FBI agents last year and recently sent
information to the Massachusetts Republican Committee.
   ``It's a fight for our way of life,'' said Thomas-Vitrac, 44,
who moved here 11 years ago.
   New Braintree was founded 237 years ago as farm and recreation
land for the residents of Braintree, a suburb south of Boston.
Little has changed.
   Cows sometimes wander into the schoolyard. The tree-shaded
crossroads at the village center is marked only by an old brick
post office and a Congregational church. There are no stop lights
and no pay phones.
   Town Clerk Carolyn Glidden, 54, said the ``influx'' of
non-farming families has increased New Braintree's population from
about 500 in the 1960s to nearly 800 today.
   ``We're still a little farming community, but things are slowly
changing,'' said Glidden, whose husband dons the police chief
uniform after finishing his full-time landscaping job. ``We just
want this prison thing to end so we can get on with our lives.''
   ``It's been an education for all of us,'' said Thomas-Vitrac.
``Before, cows and the weather were the hot topics.''
   Cecelia Imbier said she recently rejected a $1 million offer for
part of the family dairy farm, which her great-grandfather started
more than 150 years ago.
   ``The developers are already speculating that the prison will go
through,'' said Imbier, 66. ``They underestimate us.
   ``Dukakis says he is the persistent candidate. Well, we are just
as persistent. We have too much to lose.''

<HEAD>Trade Agreement Expands Opportunities For U.S. Sales to Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese officials acknowledge that
their latest agreement to increase sales of American consumer
products in Japan is just one step on a long road to more balanced
trade.
   ``This is just a dent in the trade deficit,'' Commerce Secretary
C. William Verity said after officials from the two countries
announced the pact over the weekend. ``It's going to require we
make a lot of different dents.''
   The program is aimed at giving a boost to Japanese sales of
U.S.-made sporting goods and leisure products, jewelry, furniture,
pet foods and processed foods.
   Those items accounted for almost $1.6 billion in American
exports to Japan in 1987. But the U.S. trade deficit last year was
$170 billion, and fully $60 billion of that came from an imbalance
with Japan.
   U.S. government and business officials have long complained that
American products are not allowed fair access to Japan's rapidly
expanding market.
   Under the agreement, trade officials from both countries will
help American manufacturers locate potential customers in Japan.
Verity said he would meet soon with U.S. business executives to
discuss the program.
   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry will help
remove obstacles that have hindered U.S. sales in Japan, the
officials said.
   ``MITI will work with them in opening opportunities to get the
products on the shelves,'' Verity said. Now, he said, ``in
department stores, all products are Japanese.''
   Japanese banks and trading companies also will try to spur sales
of U.S. goods.
   Verity and Japan's minister of international trade and industry,
Hajime Tamura, announced the pact at a news conference Saturday and
said they hoped that additional industries would soon be added to
the initiative. Verity said officials from the two countries had
discussed the eventual inclusion of about 20 products, including
medical and computer equipment.
   Verity and Tamura declined to estimate what effect the agreement
would have on sales of the American products in Japan. They
acknowledged, however, that the initial results would not be
dramatic.
   ``We don't have flowers immediately when we try to sow the
seeds,'' Tamura said through a translator. ``We have to sow the
seeds first.''
   Tamura said Japan's international trade surplus, which peaked in
1986, has been dropping in recent months while domestic demand has
been growing sharply. He said that in the first five months of this
year, U.S. imports to Japan increased 43 percent over the same
period in 1987.
   ``Now is the best possible opportunity for market entries,'' he
said.
   U.S. exports to Japan last year totaled $204 million in sporting
goods and leisure products, $34 million in furniture, $217 million
in jewelry, and $1.1 billion in processed foods and pet food.
   This is the second trade agreement between the United States and
Japan in a week. Last Monday, the two countries reached a trade
pact that would result in large increases in U.S. imports of beef
and citrus fruits to Japan by phasing out or reducing quotas and
tariffs.

<HEAD>Dial-a-Porn Ban Held Up for Court Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government has agreed not to enforce a law
due to take effect July 1 banning sexually explicit telephone
messages until a federal judge reviews a challenge to the statute,
Justice Department sources say.
   The suit, filed earlier this month by a California business in
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, contends that the law has a
``chilling effect'' on constitutionally protected free speech.
   Another challenge was filed last Thursday in U.S. District Court
in New York on behalf of a group calling itself ``Consenting Adults
Telephone Rights Association.''
   The government has agreed to give the Los Angeles court until
July 25 to decide whether to put the so-called ``dial-a-porn'' law
on hold pending further hearings, said Justice Department sources
who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
   Challenges to the law were expected. When President Reagan
signed a massive education measure to which the dial-a-porn ban had
been added, he noted that ``current Supreme Court jurisprudence is
unfriendly to parts of this bill.''
   The law applies only to interstate dial-a-porn calls and those
in the District of Columbia, but most dial-a-porn services use a
976 prefix and must be reached from a local exchange. Only in
California and a few other states can they be reached long-distance
with an area code.
   Barry W. Lynn, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union,
says the law would apply only to about 10 percent of the
dial-a-porn business. But Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., a prime
sponsor of the measure, says even a limited effect would spur state
legislatures to pass their own bans.
   The law does not distinguish between live and recorded phone
communications. It does not appear to apply to party-line services,
Lynn said.
   It provides for both criminal and civil prosecution and carries
penalties of up to $100,000 for each day of violation and
imprisonment of up to six months.
   Dial-a-porn is estimated to produce about $54 million a year in
revenue for providers and phone companies, according to the
Information Industry Bulletin.
   The plaintiffs in both suits charge that the law would infringe
on their First Amendment rights.
   The Los Angeles lawsuit, filed earlier this month by Sable
Communications of California Inc., claims the law is overly broad
and vague, chills free speech and is not the least restrictive way
to keep children from reaching these services.
   Sable Communications is an affiliate of New York-based Carlin
Communications Inc., one of the country's largest dial-a-porn
providers.
   Lawrence Abelman, the attorney for Carlin whose name appears on
the suit, did not return several telephone calls for comment.
   Carlin several times has challenged Federal Communications
Commission dial-a-porn rules requiring providers to restrict access
to children. The Sable suit notes that a federal appeals court
decision in a Carlin challenge earlier this year ruled that the
government could ban ``obscene'' but not ``indecent'' telephone
communications.
   The FCC, applying a Supreme Court test, considers material to be
obscene if it depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way,
appealing to the prurient interest of an average person and lacking
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   The new law bans both obscene and indecent phone messages.
   The New York suit seeks to block enforcement of the law against
``live telephone conversations between consenting adults that have
been paid for in advance by credit card,'' said Bruce J. Ennis Jr.,
a Washington D.C. attorney who filed the suit.
   Ennis said the plaintiffs in the action want to remain anonymous
for reasons of privacy. They are listed in the suit as ``Jane Roe,
John Doe Inc. and Consenting Adults Telephone Rights Association.''
   Pressure from anti-pornography groups and complaints about
access by children who run up huge bills listening to pornographic
messages has been reducing the areas in which recorded dial-a-porn
services may operate.
   BellSouth, the regional Bell company covering nine southeastern
states, does not allow dial-a-porn on its network, and US West has
begun to pull the plug on these recorded messages in the 14 states
it serves.
   Also, many of the pornographic services that used American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s pay-to-listen 900 lines have dropped
off since the company changed its billing system earlier this year,
the company says.

   The remains of 28 American servicemen found
in Canada in November will be returned to this country for burial
this week, 174 years after they were killed while fighting in the
War of 1812.
   The soldiers will be buried Thursday with full military honors,
including a 21-gun salute, U.S. Army officials said. A plaque also
will be placed in the cemetery in the town of Bath commemorating
the soldiers' deaths in 1814 during the closing days of the Niagra
campaign, the discovery of their remains in 1987 and reburial in
1988.
   ``These boys will be treated as if they died yesterday,'' said
Lt. Col. Robert Trotter. ``Just because we're late doesn't mean
they won't get what they deserve.''
   The skeletons were unearthed by construction workers digging a
house foundation in Fort Erie, Ontario, across the Niagara River
from Buffalo.
   Archaeologists moved the remains to a Toronto laboratory where
most were identified as Americans, Trotter said.
   Trotter said hundreds of sites were considered for the
reburials, but military records indicated most of the men were from
central New York, where Bath is located.
   ``We figure about 90 percent of the men who fought in the
Niagara campaign were from the Finger Lakes area,'' he said. ``It's
only right that they should be going home.''
   Although individual indentification of the remains could not be
made, Ronald Williamson, a Canadian archaeologist who led the
investigation, said the discovery yielded extensive information
about the war between the Americans and the British.
   Williamson said most the soldiers were in their teens and early
20s and died horrible deaths.
   ``The philosophy of medicine at the time was to make a complex
wound simple. If you got shot in the hand, they cut off your arm,''
he said.
   Williamson said the soldiers probably died during the daily
assaults by British mercenaries on a U.S. position at Snake Hill.
The burial ground was a sandy knoll on the shore of Lake Erie.
   Each body showed some preparation before burial, indicating that
the survivors were in a rush, he said. ``These probably weren't
battlefield deaths, but victims of snipers or artillery barrages in
the weeks after the main battle.''
   Military records indicate that about five men were lost each day
during the siege on the position.
   The campaign ended weeks later when American forces withdrew and
the burial ground was apparently forgotten.

<HEAD>Dukakis ``A Blank Page'' With Voters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To an uncertain and divided electorate,
Michael Dukakis is ``a blank page'' whose lead over George Bush is
grounded in negative feelings about the Republican vice president,
rather than positive attitudes toward the Democratic nominee-to-be,
according to a survey released today.
   The national poll did find Democrats remarkably united behind
Dukakis at this point, although there are weaknesses in the
coalition that Bush could exploit to build his chances for a fall
victory.
   Much of Dukakis' strength comes from voters worried about the
course of the nation.
   ``Democrats are seen as the party of change. Bush is not,'' said
Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization, which conducted
the poll for the Times-Mirror Corp.
   The survey, the latest in a series for the media company, is
based on interviews with 3,021 adults in person from May 13-22. The
margin of error was two percentage points.
   The horse-race numbers for the poll gave Dukakis 53 percent of
the registered voters and Bush 40 percent. Seven percent were
undecided.
   Overall, Dukakis drew a favorable response from 66 percent of
the sample, while 22 percent rated him unfavorably. Bush got 51
percent positive marks and 42 percent negative.
   But the Dukakis numbers are the result of a ``vague, mildly
positive image,'' the poll analysis said, pointing out that
relatively few voters could rate Dukakis on a range of specific
characteristics. Only 29 percent said he ``can get things done''
while 33 percent said he is well-informed.
   Bush's image is a bit clearer, since he has been on the national
scene longer, but he is stuck with ``some strong negatives and
relatively few positives,'' the analysis said.
   ``Dukakis is still a blank page to most people,'' Kohut said,
adding that ``neither man has a clearly drawn image.''
   Asked in the poll if they were voting more for their candidate
or against his opponent, Bush backers were mostly positive. Of his
40 percent support, 26 percentage points were based on pro-Bush
sentiments and 11 percent anti-Dukakis. Three percent were not sure.
   But half of Dukakis' supporters took a negative stance. Of
Dukakis' 53 percent, only 22 percentage points were pro-Dukakis; 26
percent were anti-Bush; and the rest were not sure.
   The Times-Mirror surveys over the past year have divided the
public into 11 groups based on their values and partisan
affiliation.
   Dukakis is doing well in part because he is drawing strong
support in three of the four usually Democratic groups _ 80 percent
or better. In fact, the poll said that Democrats are slightly more
loyal to Dukakis at this point than Republicans are to Bush _ a
dramatic change from the high rates of Democratic defection in
recent decades at the presidential level.
   Bush has solid backing in the two key GOP groups.
   But the vice president has not won the strong support Ronald
Reagan had in a group the poll calls the ``Disaffecteds,'' those
who are pessimistic and deeply suspicious of both big government
and big business.
   There are, however, weaknesses in the Democratic coalition.
   One conservative segment _ called ``God and Country Democrats''
_ and a swing group called ``Seculars'' are giving about a quarter
of their support to Bush, despite the groups' natural Democratic
leanings.
   Bush's poor showing, in the face of the relative economic
prosperity of the country under a Reagan-Bush administration, seems
to spring from long-term trends worrying the public.
   For example, 54 percent think they will be personally better off
next year, while only 10 percent say their financial situation will
deteriorate.
   And 24 percent think the national economy will improve in the
next year, while 46 percent believe there will be little change.
Twenty percent are pessimistic.
   In sharp contrast to such optimism, only 41 percent of the
public was satisfied with ``the way things are going'' in the
country, while 54 percent were dissatisfied.
   And 37 percent said is likely or certain that the U.S. economy
could collapse in the next 10 years because of foreign competition.
   With such pessimism after seven years of GOP control of the
White House, it should not be surprising that the Democrats are
perceived as the party most likely to bring about changes.
   Forty-three percent of those questioned said the Democratic
Party ``can bring about the kinds of changes the country needs,''
with only 27 percent labeling the GOP that way. Nine percent said
both parties, 11 percent said neither and 10 percent were not sure.

   Bob Dole couldn't be nicer to George Bush
these days, so nice that people are beginning to wonder if the
Kansas senator yearns to be No. 2 to the man he once said had
``gotten quite a ways without ever doing much.''
   The caustic tone of the campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination is gone and Dole now proclaims he's ready to hit the
road to help the vice president in his battle against Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   ``We're available,'' Dole said after Bush met with GOP senators
at the Capitol recently. ``Send us where you want, we're ready to
go.''
   For months, Dole belittled the vice president as a likely loser
in November and as someone who could point to nothing he had done
on his own.
   But now the Kansas senator directs his fire at Dukakis, the
certain Democratic presidential nominee. And when Dole attacks
Dukakis as an ``out-of-touch liberal,'' he often gets a nice
thank-you note from Bush.
   The warming in relations between Bush and Dole prompts
speculation the senator could end up as the Republican vice
presidential nominee.
   But Bush on Sunday dismissed a report that his aides were
focusing on Dole as the leading candidate for the slot, saying,
``Nobody is authorized to speak in my behalf.''
   ``There isn't a long list or a short list,'' Bush said.
   ``He clearly is running for vice president,'' Lyn Nofziger, a
former White House political aide and Dole friend, said of the
senator. Nofziger quickly added that he did not base his view on
any conversation with the senator.
   ``He certainly isn't lusting after it,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman
of New Hampshire, who supported Dole for the GOP presidential
nomination and remains close to the senator.
   Rudman said he saw nothing in the shift in Dole's attitude to
indicate he was eager to be vice president.
   ``I don't see anything in Bob's actions to indicate he is
pursuing this (the vice presidency),'' said Rudman. ``It's in Bob
Dole's interest to have George Bush win the presidency.''
   But would Dole take second on the ticket?
   Dole was asked Saturday about chances he'd be the running mate.
   ``If I got the call, I'd say, `Mr. Vice President, let's talk,'
but that hasn't happened,'' Dole said.
   ``What he would do if asked the question, I just don't know,''
said Rudman.
   ``I don't have any doubt if he's asked, he'll take it,'' said
Donald Devine, a former adviser to the Dole presidential campaign.
   ``It's George Bush's call,'' said Walt Riker, a Dole spokesman
when asked if the senator would accept the vice presidential
nomination. ``And it's a long way between now and New Orleans.''
The city is the site of the GOP convention in August.
   Riker said that ``at this point Dole would like to be Senate
majority leader again,'' a post he held until Republicans lost
control of the Senate in the 1986 election and his title changed to
minority leader.
   Opinion polls suggest a Bush-Dole ticket would be a strong
Republican combination.
   For example, a poll published last month in the Charlotte, N.C.,
Observer, said a Bush-Dole ticket was preferred by North Carolina
voters by 9 points over a Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   Surveying South Carolina voters, the same poll found a Bush-Dole
ticket preferred over Dukakis and several different running mates
including Nunn, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Jesse Jackson.
   Of course, a Bush-Dole ticket will jog memories of all those
things Dole said about the vice president when they were battling
for votes in Iowa and New Hampshire and the other Republican
primary and caucus states.
   To those who recall Dole describing Bush as nothing more than
``a resume and a retinue,'' and who remember the senator demanding
that Bush ``stop lying about my record,'' it would be an
uncomfortable pairing.
   But then Bush became Ronald Reagan's running mate after a
campaign during which he coined the term ``voodoo economics'' to
describe Reagan's plan to cut taxes, increase defense spending and
balance the budget.
   John F. Kennedy offered Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas the second
spot on the ticket and was described by his brother, Robert F.
Kennedy, as stunned when Johnson accepted the offer.

<HEAD>Trade Work Continues Despite Farm Subsidy Impasse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators report they are making significant
progress in the effort to expand and strengthen the rules governing
world trade despite a contentious fight over farm subsidies.
   But the Reagan administration is concerned that global trade
talks could be dealt a severe setback if the next president doesn't
make the negotiations a top priority.
   The United States and 95 other countries have been holding talks
since late 1986 on ways to improve the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the global compact which governs trade.
   These talks were in the headlines last week at the Toronto
economic summit when President Reagan repeated his call for a total
elimination of all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000. The
other nations refused to endorse the idea, opting instead for a
call to reduce subsidies, which now annually total $200 billion
worldwide.
   But the world's largest industrial powers, the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, did adopt
strong language urging their trade ministers to make progress in
the current global trade talks, known as the Uruguay round because
they were launched in that country at a conference in late 1986.
   ``As the Uruguay round enters a more difficult phase, it is
vital to ensure the momentum of these ambitious negotiations,'' the
summit nations declared. ``The greatest possible advance must be
made in all areas.''
   Negotiators for the biggest trading markets, the United States,
Japan, Canada and the 12-country European Economic Community, met
after the Toronto summit for an additional two days at a lake
resort in Brainerd, Minn. Officials there said they were encouraged
by progress made in narrowing other differences.
   An American official, who spoke on condition that his name not
be used, said negotiators were close to reaching agreement on
tougher rules to protect patents, copyrights and trademarks, areas
where international piracy has cost U.S. businesses more than $46
billion.
   The United States is also pushing for rules to govern trade in
services, such as telecommunications and insurance, and global
investment, two areas where the United States has a competitive
edge. Neither category is now covered by global trading rules.
   Officials said progress had been made in finding ways to
increase the free flow of investment between countries, but they
reported less success in trying to write rules governing trade in
services, primarily because of a dispute over just which of 150
services categories should be covered.
   Trade officials were more hopeful that a session scheduled for
Montreal in December would bring agreement on ways to strengthen
the Geneva-based GATT's procedures for settling trade disputes
between nations by speeding up a process that can now drag on for a
decade or more.
   U.S. officials said they believed a new streamlined dispute
mechanism would receive approval in Montreal and begin operating by
next year.
   Likewise, U.S. negotiators expressed confidence that reforms in
the operation of the GATT would also be adopted, at least on an
interim basis. The United States is proposing establishment of a
12- or 14-member steering committee representing both industrial
and Third World countries. It would set trade policy between the
meetings of all 96 nations which belong to GATT.
   After the Minnesota negotiating session, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was more hopeful that
significant progress can be made at the Montreal session, which is
coming at the midpoint of the scheduled four-year Uruguay round of
talks.
   ``We have narrowed the differences and achieved consensus in
quite a number of areas,'' he said.
   But on agriculture, U.S. negotiators remained far apart from
officials of Western Europe and Japan, who believe Reagan's call
for a total elimination of all subsidies by the end of the century
is politically unrealistic.
   Officials of other countries also expressed concern about how
much authority U.S. negotiators will have in Montreal to speak for
the next administration, which will not take office until Jan. 20.
   Yeutter said the administration will brief trade advisers for
the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates to keep them
informed on the progress of the negotiations. He said he did not
expect major changes in the U.S. negotiating position regardless of
who is elected.

<HEAD>Many Defense Contractors Don't Register As Lobbyists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When lawmakers are asked to identify Pratt &
Whitney's chief lobbyists on Capitol Hill, they quickly rattle off
the names of Jack Humphries and Mary Ellen Jones.
   But despite their close and frequent contact with legislators
and top aides, the two Pratt & Whitney employees are not registered
as lobbyists with the clerk of the House. The company _ and other
defense contractors who do not register their legislative liaisons
_ say the staffers are not lobbyists but ``information providers.''
   The confusion is an illustration of a federal law that critics
say does not clearly describe what constitutes lobbying or provide
a mechanism to regulate it effectively.
   Pratt & Whitney and its parent company, United Technologies
Corp., do not register their legislative liaisons as lobbyists
because, they say, the staffers are only providing information to
Congress _ even though the information is about congressional
issues that have a direct bearing on the businesses.
   ``Our people only visit the hill to provide information,'' said
UTC spokesman James Linse. ``He's not saying, `Lowell, vote for A,
B and C.' He's providing information.''
   The 1946 law describes a lobbyist as a person who is paid ``for
the purpose of attempting to influence the passage or defeat of any
legislation by the Congress.''
   ``The law is basically loophole-ridden,'' said Ann McBride,
senior vice president at Common Cause, which has fought to toughen
the law's reporting and enforcement requirements. ``It is a law
that is widely ignored.''
   McBride said the lobbying registration issue has been rekindled
in the wake of the FBI's military purchasing investigation, which
involves contractors, their Washington-based officials and their
private consultants.
   The registration statute has virtually no enforcement provisions.
   ``We don't go out and seek lobbyists and determine whether those
persons do or do not meet the requirements,'' said Patricia Bias,
director of the House Clerk's Records and Registration Office. ``If
someone would complain, they would be (referred) to the Justice
Department.''
   But that rarely _ if ever _ happens.
   Critics say the law needs to be expanded to add an enforcement
provision and widen the definition of lobbying to include
``information providers'' such as those from Pratt & Whitney.
   ``You present information which is building the case for your
issue. You're not going in there giving information that gives the
other side of the issue,'' McBride said. ``It is information used
to make your best case why an issue should be passed or defeated.''
   United Technologies is not the only major defense contractor
that does not register its legislative liaisons as lobbyists. Among
the nation's 10 biggest defense contractors, McDonnell Douglas
Corp., Raytheon Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. also have no
employees registered as active lobbyists, according to company
officials and House lobbing records.
   ``We look at this as liaison as opposed to influencing
legislation,'' said Frank Tomlinson of McDonnell Douglas.
   Officials at the four contractors say their legislative liaisons
respond to congressional requests for information on specific
programs, attend hearings and track legislation. The ``lobbying''
of lawmakers is left to consultants and firms hired by the
contractors, they say.
   Yet the other major contractors _ General Dynamics Corp.,
General Electric Co., Lockheed Corp., General Motors Corp., Boeing
Co. and Grumman Corp. _ all have similar legislative liaisons who
are registered as lobbyists, in addition to hired lobbyists from
outside the companies, the House records show.
   ``The policy has been if you're going to lobby you register,''
said Boeing spokesman Joe Vranich.
   Registering legislative liaisons has not always been the policy
even at those companies. General Dynamics staffers only began
registering with Congress in 1985.
   ``We felt that in order to avoid any question we would go ahead
and register,'' said General Dynamics spokesman Al Spivak. ``Prior
to that we felt that under the explicit provision of the law it
wasn't necessary, but we decided to avoid any question on the
matter.''

<HEAD>Report Warns Against US Grain Subsidy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An analysis by the Agriculture Department
raises questions about waging an export subsidy war with the
European Economic Community to force acceptance of U.S. demands for
phasing out all farm subsidies by the year 2000.
   The staff report, ``Targeting of U.S. Agricultural Export
Subsidies,'' used four theoretical cases involving the
subsidization of wheat and corn exports to selected countries where
subsidized foreign competition _ notably the EEC _ has undercut
U.S. sales.
   It concludes that while U.S. farmers would benefit from higher
export revenues, ``domestic consumers will be hurt.''
   ``Given the effect of U.S. subsidies on the world wheat and corn
markets, other exporters would not likely remain passive'' while
the United States increases its market share at their expense.
   ``All four cases show gains to the subsidy programs in terms of
net export revenue, even if the EEC targets its wheat subsidies to
maximize its export revenue,'' the report said. ``Most gains come
from the subsidization of wheat rather than of corn.''
   The report added: ``Given the objective of export revenue
maximization, the United States does not have the power to coerce
the EEC into a weakened export position. Also, the net (annual)
cost to the United States of such a program would be about $1
billion.''
   The United States has insisted that agricultural trade barriers,
including direct and non-direct subsidies, should be eliminated
over the next decade or so.
   But the EEC, the main target of such a plan, has rebuffed the
idea as unrealistic and unworkable.
   At last week's round of trade talks in Brainerd, Minn.,
involving the United States, Canada, Japan and the EEC, negotiators
remained far apart on the farm subsidy issue.
   Even so, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the
United States was not willing to modify its demands and would
continue to seek the reforms, at least for now.
   Yeutter also said Congress might increase U.S. export subsidies,
as it did in 1985, if negotiations stall.
   The study was prepared as ``a theoretical analysis'' by Stephen
L. Haley of the department's Economic Research Service, who said
its purpose was to assess U.S. ability to influence world wheat and
corn markets through ``an actively supported targeted export
subsidy program.'' A copy was provided at the request of The
Associated Press.
   Such a program has been in operation for three years as the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Under it, exporters are paid
subsidies, or ``bonuses'' of surplus government-owned commodities,
so they can sell wheat, corn or other designated products to
selected foreign countries at reduced prices.
   ``In all four cases, the benefits to the wheat and corn
producing sectors do not outweigh the subsidy costs,'' the report
said. ``In all four cases, losses of $1 billion (a year) occur in
national welfare. The drive to maximize export revenue is not
self-financing.''
   Not only would other countries likely to retaliate, large shifts
in trading patterns might violate restrictions in the 94-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on ``inequitable'' market
shares, the report said.
   ``The United States would be more vulnerable in the world wheat
market because its world wheat market share is considerably less
than its corn share,'' the report said.
   It added: ``Although Canada and Australia could conceivably
retaliate for the U.S. program, it is the EEC, judged by its past
behavior, that would be the likely candidate to take retaliatory
action in the world wheat market.''
   The Reagan administration has been under pressure from some farm
groups and members of Congress to continue the Export Enhancement
Program at its recent high level, even though drought has raised
uncertainties about U.S. grain production this year.
   But Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng says it's too early to
make a firm commitment on EEP, because more needs to be known about
U.S. and world grain supplies for 1988-89.
   ``But I'll tell you this,'' he said last week. ``We will not
neglect our export trade.''

<HEAD>Bush Faults Congress in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says the
nation's prison capacity should be dramatically expanded as part of
a get-tough attitude toward drug dealers.
   Bush, who is slated to get the Republican presidential
nomination this summer, also claimed that Congress has failed to
support law enforcement against drugs.
   A representative of Democrat Michael Dukakis, meanwhile, laid
the blame at the door of Bush and the Reagan administration.
   The opposing assertions by Bush and Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., were made Sunday at a national conference of the Fraternal
Order of Police.
   Focusing on what has become a major issue in this year's
presidential campaign, Bush and DeConcini each pointed the finger
for letting the drug situation escalate out of control.
   On the prison issue, ``The single most important thing Congress
could do in the war on drugs is alleviate the shortage of state
prison space, responsible for the premature release of countless
criminals,'' Bush told the audience of about 200.
   He said the country is spending ``anywhere from $2 billion to $5
billion a year on domestic military bases we don't need any more''
and that those could be converted to minimum-security prisons.
   He said at a subsequent news conference that he did not have a
list of bases in mind but that a review of such facilities should
be conducted and that no state should be exempt.
   ``Congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs,
but when it comes to law enforcement, some of them go AWOL,'' Bush
claimed, using the military jargon for absent without leave.
   He said Congress reduced the administration's Coast Guard budget
request last year by $72 million, and by $864 million over four
years.
   But DeConcini said that was ``just a bogus argument.''
   He said it was the administration that did the cutting and
Congress that restored drug-fighting dollars. He said President
Reagan's 1988 budget sought a $900 million cut in anti-drug funds,
including money for the Coast Guard and Border Patrol, and a 60
percent cut in drug prevention and education programs.
   DeConcini said Congress restored 70 percent of the money.
   DeConcini also attacked Bush's performance as head of the
National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, which he said was
``an organization of half-empty offices lacking organization'' that
failed in its drug-fighting goals.
   DeConcini said he was addressing the group as a surrogate for
Dukakis, who has sewn up the Democratic presidential nomination and
is spending a few days vacationing in Nantucket, Mass.
   In his speech, Bush called for mandatory testing of ``anyone
responsible for the public safety,'' recriminalization of drug
possession in states where it has been decriminalized, and the
death penalty for drug kingpins and those who commit drug-related
murders.
   He also urged continuation of the ``zero tolerance'' policy
aimed at users of drugs in even small amounts, and drug education
programs for youth and in the work place.
   At his news conference, Bush was asked about a New York Times
report that his aides are focusing on Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas as
the leading candidate to become Bush's running mate.
   ``Nobody is authorized to speak in my behalf,'' Bush said,
adding he does not yet have ``a long list or a short list.''
   Dole, while campaigning for Bush on Saturday in Oregon,
indicated the two have not had a discussion about his joining the
ticket.
   In choosing a running mate, Bush said he would look for ``a
philosophical compatibility and a temperamental compatibility.''

<HEAD>Scientists Downgrade Solar Flare Effects Expected Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Effects of a magnetic storm set off by a major
solar flare last week and expected to reach Earth Monday won't be
nearly as severe as first predicted, federal scientists said Sunday
night.
   ``We've dropped our forecast further still,'' said Norm Cohen of
the Space Environment Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration based in Boulder, Colo.
   Initially, arrival of the magnetic storm was expected to cause
major disruptions to electrical transmission and to shortwave and
other communications, including contact between airliners and
ground controllers and long-distance telephone calls.
   Cohen said these effects would be ``either non-existent or much
less intense.'' But he said the magnetic storm could still cause
errors in the orbits of some satellites.
   ``The region (on the sun) responsible for the very large flaring
several days ago has decreased in its level of complexity although
it still retains potential for producing large energetic flares,''
Cohen said.
   NOAA officials in Boulder on Friday predicted the serious storm
after the largest solar flare in four years exploded on the sun _
an explosive release of hot gas, electrically charged particles and
X-rays. The original forecast was downgraded Saturday and
downgraded further on Sunday.

   Wasp larvae or water bug eggs are fine, but
Gene DeFoliart prefers deep-fried greater wax moth larvae, which
taste just like bacon.
   ``Insects are as nutritionally valuable as many kinds of meat
animals,'' said the University of Wisconsin entomologist, who has
been promoting bugs as a staple since around 1974.
   ``They are the most protein available to people who don't have
anything else. They also have a good fat, vitamin and mineral
content.''
   DeFoliart, who snacks on the critters himself once in a while,
finds ways to use them as cheap feed supplements in poor countries.
   There are 500 different insect species worldwide eaten by people
in nearly three dozen Asian, African and South and Central American
countries, he said.
   DeFoliart said he is concerned many people in developing
countries are being pressured to consume less nutritional
alternatives to insects because of growing Western influence on
those areas.
   ``It's not a goal of ours to get people in the United States to
eat insects,'' DeFoliart said. ``But we don't think we should stand
in the way in places where they are being used.''
   In Mexico, a favorite is wasp larvae, which taste like almonds.
Various ants taste like lemon, nuts or cola.
   Certain types of water bug egg, which taste like shrimp, are
harvested for Mexican caviar and served in the best restaurants.
Another delicacy is escamoles, or immature ants.
   In 1983, the Thai government began urging farmers not to spray
crop-damaging grasshoppers, but catch them, DeFoliart said.
   Soon after, fried grasshoppers became a favorite. ``They hawked
them in the streets of Bangkok and served them in the best
restaurants,'' said DeFoliart.
   ``Termites are particularly important in some parts of Africa.
The termites we're talking about are much bigger than the ones you
see here,'' he said. ``Some of these have a wing-span of 4 to 6
inches.''
   DeFoliart is involved in two projects to determine the value and
feasibility of using insects as feed supplements.
   This spring, Nepalese farmers are harvesting a species of large
brown cricket for poultry feed in place of imported fish meal, an
expensive item.
   In Mexico and Central America, Wisconsin researchers are raising
crickets for poultry, swine, and pond fish food, as well as human
consumption, DeFoliart said.
   Similar efforts in the United States, involving mormon crickets
primarily found in the West, have had little success.
   ``We have not yet found a feasible way to mass produce them so
that crickets can compete economically with soybean meal,''
DeFoliart said.
   One of his less important pet projects is to someday market
three types of insect food for human consumption in the United
States: cricket nymphs; bee brood, which is the pupae stage of the
drone bee; and greater wax moth larvae.
   ``If they're ever on the market they'll probably be expensive.
It will be a novelty item for a cocktail party,'' he said.

   Women have yet to reach equality with men in
any country but they come closest in Sweden, followed by Finland
and then the United States, a study by a private population group
concludes.
   At the other end of the scale, women's status is lowest in
poverty-stricken Bangladesh, according to the report by the
independent Population Crisis Committee.
   ``The world's poorest women are not merely poor. They live on
the edge of subsistence. They are economically dependent and
vulnerable, politically and legally powerless,'' said Sharon L.
Camp, vice president of the committee which studies population
issues.
   Scoring well in many categories, particularly in social equality
and employment opportunities, Sweden was ranked first in women's
status.
   Finland was listed as No. 2, while the United States placed
third, doing particularly well in providing educational
opportunities for women.
   No country managed to be listed as ``excellent,'' however.
   Sweden led the ``very good'' section and was joined by Finland,
the United States, East Germany, Norway, Canada and Denmark.
   Bangladesh finished a distant last, with Mali, Afghanistan,
North Yemen and Pakistan rounding out the bottom five.
   The ratings are based on measures of women's status in health,
marriage and children, education, employment and social equality.
   Nowhere do women enjoy equal status with men, the report said.
   ``But in the least developed countries of Africa, the Middle
East, Asia and Latin America, crushing poverty overlaid with
longstanding patterns of discrimination create living conditions
for women almost too harsh to imagine,'' the report said.
   Women grow half the world's food but most own no land. They are
one-third of the paid work force, but are concentrated in the
lowest-paid jobs. Those who have jobs outside the home usually put
in a double day with household and child-care chores.
   Here is a rundown of the five areas of women's status and the
findings of the study:
   _Health:
   This category included infant and child mortality, mortality of
women in their childbearing years and life expectancy. Finland was
the top-ranked with a rating of 20. Austria and France were close
at 19.5.
   The United States scored 19, tied with Australia, Belgium,
Canada, West Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Last was Afghanistan at only 3.5; Bangladesh and Mali were not
much better at 5.5.
   _Marriage and Children:
   This ranking was based on the percent of women who marry while
still adolescents, national fertility rate, prevalence of
contraceptive use and ratio of widows and divorced women heading
households.
   Australia and New Zealand were the only countries to score a
full 20 points. Scoring 19.5 were Sweden and Taiwan, while Belgium,
Finland, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom all scored 19.
   The United States scored 18.5, as did Canada, China,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, East Germany, West Germany and
Switzerland.
   Last was Saudi Arabia at 4 points, while Bangladesh had 4.5.
   _Education:
   This category covered school and college enrollment of women,
percentage of women teachers and differences in literacy rates
between men and women.
   The United States ranked first at 18.5 points, followed by
Jamaica with 18. Sweden managed only 15.5 here.
   Last was Benin at 2.5 points, while North Yemen had 3 and Nepal
and Libya rated 4.
   _Employment:
   The employment category was based on the percentage of women
working for pay, the share who are self-employed and the number in
technical and professional occupations.
   Sweden was tops in women's employment at 14.5 points, followed
by East Germany at 13.5 and Mozambique and the Soviet Union at 12.5
each.
   The United States scored 10, tied with Canada and
Czechoslovakia, but trailing Barbados and Finland at 11.5; Denmark
and Norway at 11; and Bulgaria at 10.5
   Tied for last place with ratings of 2 were Afghanistan, Algeria,
Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and North Yemen.
   _Social Equality:
   This category generally measured women's political and legal
equality with men, the degree to which they can expect equal
treatment in the workplace, property rights, rights in divorce and
protection from discrimination.
   Finland and Sweden were tops with 18.5 points each.
   The United States managed 16.5, as did Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East
Germany, West Germany, Greece, Hungary, Jamaica, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
   Finishing last with ratings of 2 were Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Key Defense Lawmakers Get Millions from Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political action committees representing six
of the companies linked to the Pentagon purchasing fraud
investigation have given nearly $3 million to congressional
candidates in the last three election cycles.
   Nearly half of this money _ 47 percent _ was channeled to
members of the four military committees in Congress, according to
Federal Election Commission reports. Members of these panels
received average contributions of $1,293.
   The reports also show how, in some cases, the defense
contractors have been able to legally provide money to lawmakers
they would not legally be able to give to other government
officials.
   The principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucial
decisions about Pentagon spending and procurement priorities
through their memberships on the House and Senate armed services
committees and defense appropriations subcommittees.
   Last year, 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four military
committees reported receiving about $137,100 in speaking fees from
defense contractors publicly linked to the Pentagon probe.
   All but $10,000 went to the House side of the Capitol, with 33
members _ Democrats and Republicans alike _ averaging $3,852 each
in so-called honoraria.
   Speaking fees are legal on Capitol Hill, but they are forbidden
by law among executive branch officials. Senators can pocket up to
$35,800 a year in such outside income, House members up to $26,850.
   The Associated Press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosure
statements of committee members and campaign contribution reports
filed with the Federal Election Commission for the 1988, 1986 and
1984 elections.
   The reports were filed by political action committees maintained
by six of the defense contractors who have been searched under
warrants issued in the massive probe of alleged Pentagon
procurement fraud and bribery.
   They are McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defense
contractor; Litton Industries; United Technologies-Pratt & Whitney;
Northrop; Cubic Corp. and Hazeltine Corp.
   The survey hit only the tip of the iceberg. The companies tied
so far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry, with
dozens of others routinely making campaign contributions and paying
honoraria to members of Congress.
   Congressional leaders said last week that they had been told by
the chief prosecutor, Henry Hudson, that no lawmakers were targets
of the 2-year-old investigation or had their records seized by the
FBI.
   The destination of the speaking fees _ often accompanied by free
trips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts
_ tells a lot about where the real power of the Pentagon purse lies
on Capitol Hill.
   Twenty-two of the 52 members of House Armed Services reported
getting speaking fees from the surveyed defense contractors. This
panel sets broad policy and authorizes items like weapons systems.
   But a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it,
and that money on the House side of the Capitol comes from the
smallest military panel in Congress, the 11-member House defense
appropriations subcommittee headed by Rep. William Chappell, D-Fla.
   Last year, Chappell and eight colleagues on the subcommittee
reported getting $46,250 _ an average of $5,138 apiece _ from
contractors tied to the investigation.
   Chappell may head the committee, but he wasn't the favorite
speaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records. That was
Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who said he collected $8,000 for four
appearances. Chappell reported $4,000.
   Others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyed
contractors included Reps. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, $7,000; Les
AuCoin, D-Ore., $6,250; Bob Livingston, D-La., $6,000; and Bill
Young, R-Fla., $6,000.
   Young's disclosure statement illustrated a practice among
defense contractors, who may fight each other for Pentagon jobs but
can cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour.
   Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16, 1987, nine contractors _ seven of
them not named in the probe _ shared the costs of flying, housing
and feeding Young for a trip that included visits to facilities in
California and Texas.
   For nine speeches in the five-day stretch, Young picked up
$13,000 in honoraria, according to his disclosure statement.
   Speaking fees are small change for defense contractors compared
to what they pour into campaign treasuries, especially those of
military committee members.
   The biggest spread was in 1983-4 by Northrop's PAC: an average
of $2,014 for members of military committees, $876 for non-members.
   Again, the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored PAC
targets. The average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was
$1,866.
   House defense appropriations was all-but blanketed with PAC
money, with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members.
For the 18-member Senate counterpart, no PAC gave to more than
eight members in the same election cycle.
   A PAC can give a candidate up to $10,000 in each two-year
election cycle. The survey found three instances: Northrop's PAC to
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., in 1984 and United Technologies-Pratt &
Whitney's PAC to Warner and Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the same
year.
   Military committee members consistently getting
higher-than-average PAC contributions included Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif.; Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Murtha; Chappell; Rep. Roy
Dyson, D-Md.; and Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala.
   Two lawmakers on Armed Services committees _ Sen. Lawton Chiles,
D-Fla., and Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. _ took neither honoraria
nor PAC money from the defense contractors identified with the
investigation, the records showed.

<HEAD>Orchestra Plays 4 Ellington Tone Poems</HEAD>

   Duke Ellington liked to compose tone poems, as
well as short jazz tunes, and the American Composers Orchestra
performed four of those longer work at Carnegie Hall in what was
billed as the first all-Ellington symphonic concert.
   The evening was conducted by Maurice Peress. She worked with
Ellington on several projects including in 1969 making a symphonic
suite from Duke's 1943 ``Black, Brown and Beige.''
   The symphonic suite includes ``Work Song,'' with its crashing
sounds and optimism; ``Come Sunday,'' with the melody played by the
orchestra's first cellist, then with delicate shading by alto
saxophonist Frank Wess, and ``Light,'' which has a big finish _ Jon
Faddis' trumpet was heard _ as light really streams in.
   The Sunday night concert began with ``Les Trois Rois Noirs''
(``The Three Black Kings''), which Ellington was working on, for
the Dance Theater of Harlem, when he died in 1974. His son, Mercer
Ellington, composed it with him and finished it and Luther
Henderson orchestrated it for jazz band and orchestra.
   ``King Solomon'' is roiling and majestic. The theme for the
black King of the Magi was played in mellow fashion by saxophonist
Jimmy Heath. The final section eulogized Martin Luther King and
included a swinging march.
   All four of the evening's tone poems concern black history and
life. All the music combines seriousness, dignity, the lightening
of jazz and a very American-sounding optimism.
   We might have preferred performance by an ensemble with less
``sweetening'' by a huge string section and more muscle from the
brass. Guest musicians who did add fiber were bassist Ron Carter,
one-time Basie Band drummer Butch Miles, pianist Roy Glover and
saxophonists Joe Temperley, Bill Easley and Walt Weiskopf.
   Sir Roland Hanna had the pianistic style right for the piano
concerto, ``New World A-Comin','' which Ellington composed in 1943
and revised for his First Sacred Concert.
   ``Harlem,'' commissioned by the NBC Symphony in 1950, ended the
concert. Ellington undoubtedly had a detailed program in his head
when he composed ``Harlem,'' and it's fun to hear the melodies and
decide when Duke had the populace partying or somebody feeling blue.
   After intermission, the composer's sister, Ruth Ellington
Boatwright, presented an original manuscript page of ``New World
A-Comin''' to Betty Allen, a Carnegie Hall board member. The page
will hang in the composers gallery of the Carnegie Hall archives,
Miss Allen said.
   The American Composers Orchestra, which has an annual concert
series in New York, specializes in American symphonic music.
   The evening was an event of the JVC Jazz Festival and the First
New York International Festival of the Arts.

   There's a new gold rush in the
California desert, powered by 1980s technology for coaxing gold out
of low-grade ore, but miners are worried that plans for a national
park could someday end the boom.
   In the last five years, the amount of gold produced in the
region has soared from 5,000 ounces a year to 300,000, and the
industry is now worth $135 million a year, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management.
   There are 15 active mines in the area stretching roughly from
Death Valley to the Mexican border, and seven more awaiting
approval to start operations, according to the BLM, which manages
much of the region.
   ``What we are doing down here makes the Mother Lode look like
small change,'' said Peter Ertman, who oversees mining for the BLM
in Imperial County.
   The boom is the result of a decade-old run-up in gold prices and
demand combined with large-scale use of a gold extraction technique
called the heap-leach method.
   Low-grade ore that wouldn't have been worth exploiting with
older technology is crushed, pushed in to heaps hundreds of yards
long and more than 10 feet tall, and then saturated with a solution
of cyanide and water. The cyanide dissolves, or leaches out the
gold, and the water is collected at the bottom of the heap for
treatment to remove its precious cargo.
   But prospectors' horizons may be shrunk by a proposal to set
aside vast areas of the desert as a park and wilderness, miners
told U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel at a recent meeting at
Gold Fields Corp's Mesquite mine.
   A proposal to create a new, 1.5-million-acre Mojave National
Park and confer wilderness status to 4.5 million more acres of
desert would drastically limit areas for exploration, said Richard
Graeme, site manager at the Imperial County mine.
   The proposal, introduced in Congress by Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., excludes existing mines from wilderness or park
protection.
   But Hodel and others point out that each site contains finite
amounts of ore, and that miners must move on after using it.
   ``I have two kids who want to grow up to be mining engineers,''
Graeme said. ``I don't want to see anything happen to preclude them
from making a positive contribution to the economy of the United
States.''
   Environmentalists worry that the huge heap-leach mines endanger
the water table and wildlife because the cyanide-laced water runs
through open troughs from the base of the ore piles to huge open
ponds, where it sits awaiting further processing.
   Complaints have forced a variety of protective measures,
including laying multiple layers of lining beneath leach piles and
ponds to keep cyanide out of underground water supplies.
   The ponds are enclosed by chain-link fences topped with razor
wire and reinforced with small mesh at the base to keep out animals
large and small. Brightly-colored streamers are draped across the
ponds, and compressed-air cannons boom at regular intervals to
scare away birds.

   Jeff Mathis' pet, Sam, won't fetch a ball or

a fat night crawler first.
   The l{-foot-long, 3{-pound bass, who makes his home in Fontana
Lake in western North Carolina, is spending his third summer
panhandling customers at Almond Boat Park. Mathis spent hours
training him.
   Sam lurks just under the water, barely waving his tail. When
someone dangles a treat near the water's surface, Sam cocks his
head, eyeballs the snack and gently floats toward the surface.
   Then, in a fluid movement, he breaks water, snaps the worm out
of the giver's hand and slides back underwater.
   ``You should be down here and watch when the women feed him. He
bites their finger and they scream,'' Wade Hoyle of Whittier said.

   Jim Davidson may call himself a couch
potato, but he spends hours working as the president of NAAPM _ the
National Association for the Advancement of Perry Mason.
   People are fascinated by Mason, the defense attorney who won
countless cases in the old black-and-white TV series and continues
racking up victories in occasional specials, because they identify
with his battles against injustice, Davidson, 31, said in a recent
interview.
   The fan club, which Davidson founded two years ago, has 108
members in 104 states who pay $15 a year, ranging from Roger
Christman, 16, of Reading, Pa., to George Fister, 79, of Oakdale.
   ``Perry Mason stories are always a thrill,'' said Fister, whose
collection of the 150 books by Perry Mason creator Erle Stanley
Gardner number 300 volumes.
   Davidson's passion for Perry began after he quit work as a jazz
musician to pursue ``interest in other things.'' During a
subsequent career lull, he found he couldn't pull himself away from
TV reruns.
   ``Perry Mason started out being one of those `other things,' but
now it's consumed my whole life. It's almost like a monster,'' he
said, adding that he works 21 hours a week as a data processing
clerk and the rest of the time as the club's chief officer.

them from anglers.
   Dr. Carroll W. Traylor has about 300 artificial lures, fishhooks
and a few other objects, many taken from anglers who hooked
themselves on nearby Kentucky Lake.
   Traylor, who has a family practice and does minor outpatient
surgery at his clinic, began saving the items around 1958 and has
them displayed in his examining room.
   ``They're really just for conversation,'' Traylor said. ``I
really don't fish very much at all.''
   The physician is confident his collection will keep growing.
   ``I make a deal with the patients,'' he said. ``I don't take the
lure out unless they give it to me. It's as simple as that.''

   It's 112 degrees in the shade in
parts of the Mojave Desert these days. But the political heat is
rising as folks from here to Washington fight over a plan to set
aside 7.5 million acres as wilderness.
   The battleground is a starkly beautiful land of brushy desert
and craggy mountains, stretching from Death Valley to the Mexican
border, from the snow-capped Sierra Nevada and coast ranges to the
sandy borders of Nevada and Arizona.
   The rugged 35,000-square-mile sweep is home to shy bighorn
sheep, the threatened desert tortoise and a few hard-working cattle
ranchers. It has two existing national parks, rich lodes of gold
and minerals and a sprinkling of fiercely independent communities.
   Park proponents, led by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Sierra
Club and the Wilderness Society, see the desert as a fragile
treasure, already scarred beyond recovery in some spots by mine
pits and recreational vehicles.
   They would set aside a slice of varied desert terrain bigger
than the state of Delaware as Mojave National Park.
   And, they would designate as wilderness areas 80 spots deemed
ecologically sensitive, biologically unique or just beautiful,
including the South Algadones Dunes, the Orocopia Mountains, the
Saline Valley, and the Mecca Hills.
   Even opponents agree the desert deserves special reverence.
   ``It's not the dollar value,'' said cattleman Dave Fisher,
sipping a beer at a barbecue thrown by ranchers worried the bill
might drastically limit livestock grazing on federal land. ``It's
the greatness of a way of life. My God, look at that sky. Look
across the top of them old pinon trees. This is God's country.''
   Leading the fight against the bill is U.S. Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel, who toured the region last week.
   Hodel believes Mojave National Park would unfairly exclude
hunters, prospectors and explorers. He also backs a Bureau of Land
Management recommendation to limit designated wilderness areas to
44, covering less than half the area envisioned by Cranston.
   Government land outside park and wilderness should be open to
multiple use, say Hodel and the BLM, meaning vehicles could
traverse unmaintained roads and tracks, and selected mining and
grazing would be allowed.
   ``I just don't think we have to choose between either preserving
and protecting on the one hand and natural resources,
transportation corridors and the rest on the other hand,'' Hodel
said. ``We can do both.''
   Park backers nervously monitor the encroachment of civilization
from Los Angeles and San Diego.
   ``What is the megalopolis of Southern California going to need
in its back yard 100 years from now?'' muses Jim Dodson, Sierra
Club desert coordinator and resident of the booming desert suburb
of Lancaster. ``My feeling is, if we don't set these areas aside
right now, my grandchildren won't have any opportunities.''
   The two sides line up like this:
   _The Mojave National Park would cover 1.5 million acres of the
eastern Mojave Desert next to the Nevada border between Interstates
10 and 40. The BLM wants the same land declared a national scenic
area, allowing carefully regulated off-road vehicles, cattle
grazing and other commercial activities that wouldn't be permitted
in a park.
   _Cranston's proposal, dubbed S-7 after its Senate bill number,
would make 4.5 million acres of wilderness off-limits for vehicles
and new mining. The BLM is proposing 44 wilderness areas totaling 2
million acres.
   _Death Valley National Monument would be expanded from 2.1
million acres to 3.4 million acres under S-7, and Joshua Tree
National Monument would grow from 600,000 acres to 800,000. The BLM
favors less extensive expansions of both parks.
   The debate is complex, mixing economic and national security
concerns with the battle over recreation.
   One issue is the fate of four-wheel-drive routes. The vehicles
would be limited to established roads in parks and banned from
wilderness areas.
   ``It would fence out old people, young people, people with
physical impairments,'' said Carmelita Swarts, a San Diego retiree
who has roamed the desert by Jeep, collecting agates, jasper and
petrified wood.
   Bill backers say proposed wilderness boundaries were carefully
drawn so that 85 percent of the wilderness would be within 3 miles
of a road or track that would remain open to vehicles.
   The BLM estimates that S-7 would close 2,200 of the 21,000 miles
of unmaintained but passable dirt roads and tracks in the area
covered by the bill, while the Sierra Club puts the mileage at
1,200.
   About 5,000 acres would remain open for riding across country.
   Mining also would be affected. New technology that extracts gold
from low-grade ore has brought a mineral boom. Each year, about
$135 million in gold is mined in the desert, along with other
minerals that bring the total mining take to $1.2 billion.
   S-7 supporters say they drew park and wilderness boundaries to
leave known mineral-rich areas in the clear. But mining executives
worry that wilderness designation, which forbids new exploration,
could close off rich areas.
   Four big military bases in the desert provide troop training and
testing grounds for planes and missiles.
   Military brass, who limit low-level flights over park and
wilderness areas, worry that S-7 would hem their bases in with
wilderness, pressuring them to further limit flights.
   The Sierra Club's Dodson, a civilian Air Force employee, said
flight assurances can be written into the law.
   The battle appears unlikely to be resolved in the present
session of Congress. Environmentalists hope the next presidential
administration will look more favorably on the park.

   Paying the world's highest prices for fertilizer
and feed and confined to tiny plots of land, Japanese farmers are
in the best of times squeezed to make a profit.
   But a new U.S.-Japan pact to open up the nation's markets to
cheaper American beef and oranges has sown considerable anxiety
among farmers.
   Ikko Abe, a 57-year-old cattle farmer in Japan's northeastern
Iwate Prefecture, decided he could no longer cope. He hanged
himself on June 18, just two days before U.S. and Japanese
officials finished the beef and orange agreement.
   ``I oppose the liberalization of beef imports. I will protest
with my death,'' Abe wrote in a suicide note.
   The Japanese government acceded to U.S. demands to gradually
phase out quotas blocking imports over a three-year period
beginning 1991.
   Farm Minister Takashi Sato signed a similar agreement with
Australian officials in Canberra on June 24.
   Prior to liberalization, Japan agreed to raise the annual beef
quota allotment by 60,000 tons annually to 394,000 tons by fiscal
1990. Afterwards, it will be allowed to set tariffs ranging from 50
to 70 percent for the next three years to soften the impact of
cheaper beef imports on domestic farmers.
   On citrus fruit, Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh
oranges by 22,000 tons over the coming year to 192,000 tons. From
1991, Japan will permit unlimited imports of U.S. oranges, but
subject to current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20
percent off season.
   However, Japan's small-scale farmers like Abe are plagued by
mounting overhead costs and diminishing profits. They say they
cannot compete against cheaper American imports because
productivity is low in this land-starved country where the average
farm is just three acres.
   Japan has the lowest self-sufficiency rate of any major
industrialized nation and is the largest market for U.S.
agricultural exports.
   Philip Seng, Asia division head of the U.S. Meat Export
Federation, says Japan purchased 85 percent of the 190 million
pounds of beef and veal exported by the United States last year, a
load that with beef by-products was worth about $600 million.
   Imports of American oranges and orange juices totaled almost
$100 million in 1987, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
   Yasuo Sasaki, a beef farmer from the major beef-producing region
of Iwate, laments the advent of a free market system, contending
that his operation will be doomed after the three-year moratorium
ends.
   He said the government has already forced him to cut rice
cultivation by 50 percent due to overproduction and declining
consumption. If the beef market is swamped by cheaper imports, he
said farmers will be at a loss to find alternate sources of income.
   Masahiro Shiratsuki, who has a herd of 40 steers in Japan's
northernmost Hokkaido, said farmers in his rugged area, which is
not suited to cultivation, will be wiped out unless the government
implements aid measures.
   ``Dairy farmers around here can't subsist alone on the sale of
milk and they depend a great deal on the price of male calves that
they raise,'' he told the Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Japanese
newspaper.
   ``But when beef is liberalized the price of calves will fall,
demolishing the farmers around here if the government doesn't take
action.''
   After concluding the beef and orange pact, the Japanese
government announced it would introduce farm emergency measures,
including subsidies, to protect producers.
   Farmers spend about $3,200 to buy and raise a steer that they
can sell for around $4,000. When demand is down, however, prices
can fall as low as $1,600, Sasaki and other farmers say.
   By comparison, imports of U.S. carcasses sell off the dock for
$1,150, including freight and a 25 percent tariff, according to the
U.S. Meat Export Federation.
   Seng told reporters recently that the Japanese government is
forcing farmers to pay two to three times world prices for feed
grains through import taxes. The government says it takes such
steps to ensure that Japan is self-sufficient in food production.
   Takeo Hayashi, who grows mandarin oranges in Wakayama Prefecture
in southwestern Japan, says farmers in his sector have seen profits
decline even under current import restrictions.
   Orange and orange juice imports, almost entirely from the United
States, have cut sharply into domestic production, reducing the
overall cultivation from 370,000 acres in 1979 to 260,000 acres
last year.
   But critics say Japanese consumers should not have to bear the
burden of farm subsidies and import tariffs that drive up foodstuff
prices.
   Domestic beef, for example, sells for about $3.60 per 3.5
ounces, double the price of U.S. imported beef, when it is
available.
   Moreover, while the average farming income of producers has
declined sharply _ falling by 7.1 percent in 1987 to total $7,700
dollars _ income from non-farm sources is rising, according to the
Agricultural Ministry.
   The total combined income of the Japanese farmer, including
government subsidies, averages $56,850 per household, well above
the $52,800 of city-dwellers.

<HEAD>Iraq Takes Initiative in Persian Gulf War, But Iran Vows To Fight
On</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   By pushing Iran out of its last foothold
in southern Iraq _ the oil-rich Majnoon islands, Baghdad has left
no doubt that it owns the initiative in the Persian Gulf War.
   Iraq's recapture of the islands over the weekend marked the
third time in nine weeks that it employed innovative tactics and a
new-found aggressive spirit to whip the Iranians, who appeared to
have been caught napping.
   With a fourth offensive apparently nibbling away at Iran's last
brideghead in the northern Kurdistan mountains, Iraq's success in
driving the Iranians off their soil has dramatically changed the
military balance in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   The battlefield defeats have intensified Iranian disarray amid
signs of political unrest there.
   They have also forced Iran to abandon its long-held strategy of
using a 3-to-1 edge in manpower to gradually smother Iraq's
superior firepower.
   Having wrenched the initiative away from the Iranians with
unexpected ease, Iraq may now be in a position to break the
stalemate on the battlefield, some Western military analysts
believe.
   But others say they think Iraq's new aggressiveness and Iran's
expected retaliation signals another bout of heavy fighting in the
coming months.
   The Iraqis drove the Iranians out of the Faw peninsula on April
18, ending a two-year occupation, and from a bridgehead around
Salamchech east of the blockaded port city of Basra on May 25.
   The Iranians fought to within 6 miles of Basra in early 1987,
suffering huge losses but leaving what was once Iraq's second
largest city dangerously exposed.
   Tehran's military problems were heightened by its defeat by the
U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf on April 18, when six of its naval
craft were sunk or disabled.
   Iraq's Defense Minister Gen. Adnan Khairallah boasted that
Saturday's victory at Majnoon, held by the Iranians since 1984,
``directly affects the course of the war in a way that will compel
the Iranian enemy to understand the logic of peace.''
   By keeping up the pressure, Baghdad clearly hopes to exploit
political uncertainty in Tehran amid growing signs of internal
opposition to the war due to recent defeats. By some Western
estimates, more than 500,000 Iranians have been killed so far.
   Nevertheless, Iran's hardliners, who made sweeping gains in
recent parliamentary elections, appear to hold the upper hand. They
show no sign of backing down from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
avowed aim of fighting on until Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
toppled.
   ``As a revolutionary regime surviving on its ideological
commitment, such a compromise would destroy the government's
credibility and spark serious political upheavals,'' analyst Vahe
Petrossian commented in the Middle East Economic Digest.
   Some analysts believe recent setbacks have jolted the Iranians
into making a belated attempt to tackle problems of falling morale,
friction between the regular army and the Revolutionary Guards and
what appears to be an alarming increase in desertions and
draft-dodging.
   Iran's powerful Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, named
commander-in chief by Khomeini on June 2 in a bid to galvanize the
military, noted June 15 that ``we are not insisting on getting our
rights on the battlefield. We have defined non-military solutions
to the war.''
   But he stressed that he saw little prospect of Baghdad conceding
it started the war and paying billions in reparations. Thus, he
stressed: ``We are planning to continue the war until victory.''
   Nevertheless, Iran is having problems mobilizing its people.
This is widely seen as behind its failure to mount a major
offensive this winter, the first time in six years it has not done
so.
   Mehdi Bazargan, the Islamic Republic's first prime minister,
whose Freedom Movement is the only opposition party allowed to
function, issued a statement earlier this year demanding an end to
the war and accusing Khomeini of ``erroneous policies.''
   In the past, authorities have ignored Bazargan's criticisms. But
this time, reflecting the unease in Tehran, Revolutionary Guards
seized his headquarters and arrested several of his aides.
   Bazargan is believed to have evaded the dragnet and gone
underground.

<HEAD>Youth Beats Alligator To Death in Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-foot-long alligator that turned up in
a dog's kennel was beaten to death by a 12-year-old boy wielding a
tennis racket as the reptile struggled with his Doberman pinscher.
   ``It freaked me out. It was so strong,'' said Ben Clifton. ``I
hit it in the head 15, 20 times and it still wasn't dead.''
   Ben said he was watching a ``Godzilla'' movie on television
Friday when he heard his dog, Fawn, barking and growling.
   He found both animals inside the Doberman's kennel, with Fawn's
teeth clenched on the back of the gator's neck and the reptile's
teeth around the dog's collar.
   Ben ran back inside for a weapon. ``I grabbed the closest thing
... a tennis racket.''
   Ben ignored Fawn's efforts to keep him out of the kennel, and
struck the alligator. It let go of the dog and approached the boy,
who hit it until it stopped snapping. Fawn was not seriously hurt.
   Although owning a live alligator is illegal, a fraternity member
at Northwood Institute student brought the beast to Midland after a
spring break trip to Florida, according to student Bill Sulkanen.
   The student sold the gator to a Midland man when he went home
for the summer, another man who refused to give his name told the
Midland Daily News. The new owner apparently released the alligator
after leaving Midland about three weeks ago, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Research on Medicare, Medicaid Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office says Congress is
making decisions about the $120 billion-a-year Medicare and
Medicaid programs on the basis of federal research that is often
delayed or of poor quality.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the Health Care
Financing Administration was producing reports that ``were often
not fully responsive to congressional needs, were frequently late
and were variable in their technical adequacy.''
   The GAO, in a report issued Sunday, attributed some of the
problems to the lengthy review and revision process conducted by
administration policy makers both inside and outside the health
field.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on human resources, said the report raises
serious questions about how important decisions affecting health
care are made.
   ``If policies are made on the basis of inadequate or misleading
information, or if the information needed is not provided on time,
then we can expect health care to deteriorate,'' Weiss, who
requested the report, said in a statement.

   A slogan condemning Attorney General Edwin
Meese III that has drawn the wrath of law enforcement officials is
also drawing big sales numbers at a bookstore in the nation's
capital that can't keep enough T-shirts with the logo in stock.
   T-shirts with the colorful logo ``Experts Agree: Meese is a
Pig'' are the hottest-selling item ever stocked by the Common
Concerns bookstore, manager David Marcuse says. He estimated that
about 1,000 of them have been sold so far.
   The T-shirts are produced by a group of punk rock musicians and
fans who say they got into the business after they were arrested
for putting up posters with the ``Meese is a Pig'' slogan in places
where no posting is allowed.
   Group members say they decided to sell T-shirts to get out their
message in another way and to raise money to cover their legal
expenses.
   ``We weren't intending to become a T-shirt fashion fad,'' said
Mark Andersen, spokesman for the group.

<HEAD>Record Solar Disturbances Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration says increased sunspot activity in the next few
years could lead to the most intense solar disturbances ever
recorded.
   Such intense disturbances can have serious effects, including
interfering with broadcasting, damage to sensitive electronic
systems in satellite and disturbances in electrical power and
telephone transmissions.
   The NOAA said Sunday they have detected increased sunspot
activity recently, signalling solar activity that some scientists
have speculated can affect the climate on Earth.
   Changes in rainfall patterns have occurred roughly in parallel
with changes on the sun over the years. However, proving that the
two are connected has, so far, eluded science.
   Sunspots occur in cycles of approximately 11 years.
Climatologists have found slight variations in rainfall patterns in
the United States over periods of 11 years in the central and
western states and over 22 years in the eastern states.
   The current cycle began in September 1986 and already has seen
record rates of increase in sunspots and radiation from the sun,
according to Gary Heckman, head of the NOAA-Air Force Space
Environment Services Center in Boulder, Colo.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Albert C. Johnston, a black whose experience
of passing as a white physician in New Hampshire during the 1930s
was the subject of the the movie ``Lost Boundaries,'' has died. He
was 87.
   Johnston died Thursday at Castle Medical Center, where he was
being treated for chest congestion, said his son, Albert C.
Johnston Jr.
   Johnston will be buried July 9 in Keene, N.H., where his racial
secret came to light in 1940 when he was refused a commission in
the Navy because he admitted being black, his son said.
   Actor Mel Ferrer portrayed the elder Johnston in Louis de
Rochemont's 1949 production of ``Lost Boundaries,'' which was based
on W.L. White's book of the same title.
   Johnston continued to work in Keene until the mid-1960s, when he
moved to the island of Kauai, where he was a radiologist at Wilcox
Memorial Hospital, his son said.
   Johnston received his early medical education in his hometown of
Chicago.

<TEXT>
   Jack Montgomery has a bunch of hard workers on
his northwest Georgia farm, but they haven't done much lately
except stay home and fan themselves.
   ``It's the danged drought,'' the 68-year-old beekeeper said.
``All the flowers have died. North Georgia's honey production
should be at its peak right now but it's already stopped for the
year.''
   So, instead of spending these summer days collecting nectar and
making honey, Montgomery's bees are trying to beat the heat, which
was expected to reach only the upper 80s today after hovering near
100 degrees for the past week or so.
   ``The bees actually air condition their hives when it gets this
hot,'' he said last week. ``They deposit little droplets of water
along the top of the honey frames and then fan their wings, causing
it to evaporate and cool the hive.
   ``Then, they move the cool air throughout the hive, and take it
out the door when it starts to heat up. They keep repeating the
process all day long.''
   Montgomery keeps about 1.5 million bees _ an Italian variety, of
course _ at his farm south of Rome.
   He began keeping bees as a hobby 12 years ago, shortly after
getting out of the dairy business. He now has 50 hives, or
colonies, on his 1,400-acre farm.
   ``My bees actually like hot, dry weather, as a rule,'' he said.
``The ideal temperature in the hive is about 95 degrees. But when
it gets as hot as its been around here of late, the temperature
will go up to 120 degrees inside the hive if the bees don't turn on
the air conditioning.''
   Making matters worse is the horrendous lack of rainfall.
Montgomery says he knows for a fact that he lives in perhaps the
hardest-hit drought area of the Southeast.
   ``We've only gotten 14.9 inches of rainfall since the first of
the year,'' said Montgomery, who has been keeping rainfall records
for the National Weather Service for 22 years. ``Under normal
conditions, we'd have gotten 30 inches of rain by this time of
year. ...
   ``I make my observations from the rain gauge I keep out in front
of the house,'' he said. ``This is the third real bad year in a row
for us. Our normal annual rainfall around here is 53 inches but we
only got 32.7 inches last year and just 29.O inches the year
before.''
   He said this translates into bad news for beekeepers, as well as
everybody else.
   ``Normally, I'd take about 4,000 pounds of honey from my hives
this summer but I probably won't get half of that. Last year, I
only got 2,000 pounds and only 1,000 pounds the year before that.''
   He says the area is so parched that the few flowers now in bloom
have ceased producing pollen.
   ``It wouldn't make any difference, anyway,'' he added. ``When it
gets this hot and dry the bees have to spend most of their energy
trying to stay cool. It's become a matter of survival now.''

   The League of Women Voters has started a
postcard-writing campaign to try to get the 1988 presidential
candidates to debate under its sponsorship.
   Two postcards, one addressed to Republican George Bush and one
to Democrat Michael Dukakis, are being sent to league members with
an accompanying letter from Nancy Neuman, chairwoman of the group's
education fund.
   ``The shameless attempt by the two parties to `steal' the
debates threatens more than the league,'' the letter said. ``It
threatens the voters.''
   The group has sponsored presidential debates since 1976, but
this year has been fighting with the Democratic and Republican
parties which are holding their own debates.
   Dan Schnur, a Bush spokesman, said, ``We will wait and see what
the two parties decide. We are not closing any options.''
   ``I know we are committed to the Democratic National Committee
and Republican National Committee debates,'' said Steve Akey, a
Dukakis spokesman. ``At this point that is all we have committed

   Even though polls show most women favoring
Democrat Michael Dukakis over Republican George Bush in the
presidential race, former candidate for president Shirley Chisholm
says female voters should not be taken for granted.
   ``We're not as monolithic as led to believe,'' the former
Brooklyn congresswoman told a National Organization for Women
conference this weekend.
   ``You constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote, but if
you are unable to deliver that, you will be ignored,'' she said.
   Chisholm said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984
when the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George Bush handed
the Democratic ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro a
disastrous defeat.
   ``Many women, particularly southern women, couldn't identify
with Ferraro,'' she said. ``We've got ask why and learn from our
mistakes.''
   She warned against single-issue ``litmus tests'' such as
abortion.
   ``You can't use one issue as a litmus test,'' she said. ``You
can't be that emotional about politics.''

   Although problems remain in setting up the

   Ms. Maxwell and her counterpart at CBS, David Buksbaum, gave

off-the-floor matters, especially housing.
   ``Hotel rooms are really a problem,'' said NBC producer Phil

downtown hotels.

<HEAD>Only Army Can Bring About Democracy, Namphy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who reassumed power in Haiti
with a military coup last week, says in an interview published
today that only the army can create the conditions necessary to
bring democracy to his country.
   ``It would be impossible to organize elections in the current
circumstances,'' he was quoted as telling the leftist Paris daily
Liberation in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, on Friday.
   ``First of all, we have to organize the state and establish the
basis of this democracy that everyone demands but does not know how
to prepare for,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Namphy overthrew the four-month civilian administration of
President Leslie Manigat and declared himself president of this
Caribbean nation of 6 million, the Western Hemisphere's poorest
country.
   The 55-year-old military commander presided over the three-man
junta that ruled Haiti for two years after dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled in February 1986.
   He turned power over in February to Manigat, who was elected the
previous month in military-run balloting that was rife with fraud
and boycotted by the four leading presidential candidates and most
Haitians.
   ``Only the army of Haiti, as an institution, can bring human
rights to this country,'' Namphy was quoted as saying. ``I am not
afraid to say it: Gen. Namphy is the champion of human rights in
this country.''
   On Nov. 29, independently run nationwide elections were thwarted
by thugs who massacred civilian voters, killing at least 30.
Soliders made no attempt to stop the attacks and in some cases
joined in.
   Namphy said Manigat, as president, ``did not respect the
constitution ... and we could not allow him to destabilize the
army.''
   ``I had nothing against him (Manigat), nor against his
government,'' Namphy was quoted as saying. ``But you can see the
people were convinced he wanted to keep power indefinitely.''
   The power struggle that provoked Manigat's ouster began after
Namphy attempted on June 14 to transfer or retire several
high-ranking officers. Manigat vetoed the reassignments and, three
days later, fired Namphy and placed him under house arrest.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the same 19 times out of
20 if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points for conservatives, for
example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. The anti-war protests of the 1960s reached a peak in the
summer of 1968. Do you think the anti-war protests of the 1960s
influenced U.S. policy in Vietnam?
   Yes: 54 percent. No: 26 percent. Don't know or no answer: 20
percent.

involvement in the war?
   Prolonged: 23 percent. Shortened: 59 percent. Neither: 9
percent. Don't know or no answer: 9 percent.
   1b. (If yes on question 1) Do you think the anti-war protests
prevented the U.S. from winning the war?
   Yes: 30 percent. No: 58 percent. DK-NA: 12 percent.
   2. Do you think the anti-war protests of the 1960s have had a
lasting effect on U.S. foreign policy?
   Yes: 57 percent. No: 27 percent. DK-NA: 16 percent.
   2a. (If yes on question 2) Overall, do you think that effect has
been positive or negative?
   Positive: 47 percent. Negative: 45 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.
   3. Do you think the anti-war protests of the 1960s have had a
lasting effect on American society?
   Yes: 74 percent. No: 16 percent. DK-NA: 11 percent.
   3a. (If yes to question 3) Overall, do you think that effect has
been positive or negative?
   Positive: 51 percent. Negative: 41 percent. DK-NA: 8 percent.
   4. Compared to 20 years ago, are you generally more liberal now,
more conservative, or about the same?
   Liberal: 17 percent. Conservative: 29 percent. Same: 37 percent.
Does not apply: 16 percent. DK-NA: 2 percent.
   5. What about American society in general _ do you think it is
more liberal now than it was 20 years ago, more conservative, or
about the same?
   Liberal: 52 percent. Conservative: 28 percent. Same: 15 percent.
DK-NA: 6 percent.
   6. Please tell me if you agree or disagree with these statements:
   a. Young people were more interested in changing society 20
years ago than they are now. Agree: 62 percent. Disagree: 32
percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.
   b. Young people were more idealistic 20 years ago than they are
now. Agree: 65 percent. Disagree: 29 percent. DK-NA: 7 percent.
   c. Young people are more selfish now than they were 20 years
ago. Agree: 71 percent. Disagree: 23 percent. DK-NA: 6 percent.
   d. Young people are more apathetic now than they were 20 years
ago. Agree: 57 percent. Disagree: 30 percent. DK-NA: 14 percent.
   e. Young people are more realistic now than they were 20 years

   Midwestern farmers whose crops are
threatened by drought rushed to insurance agents this month to buy
a unique rain-guarantee policy, but one official says it is more
like gambling than protection.
   Agents say farmers will collect if their counties receive less
than a certain percentage of the normal June-August rainfall,
regardless of how the weather affects their crops. More rain means
no payoff.
   ``I guess it's like playing a hand of poker _ you're just
gambling on the rainfall,'' said farmer John Clark of Reddick in
northern Illinois. ``If it rains in August and your crops are
already lost, you lose your money. But what do you do in a
situation like this?''
   Clark has about 800 acres of corn that soon will reach the most
critical stage, but without rain there could be substantial losses.
   ``We've never had a year like this in all the years we've
farmed,'' said Clark, who began working the land in 1945.
   Many Cornbelt farmers are in the same predicament.
   Federal crop insurance was available to protect farmers against
losses from drought and other disasters, but University of Illinois
farm management specialist Royce Hinton says only 13 percent of the
acres in Illinois are covered.
   And that insurance must be purchased each year by April 15. The
drought was not as apparent then as it was when private insurance
agents began advertising the newer drought insurance in May and
June.
   ``I received applications for about $7 million in total
coverage,'' said Gert McGinnis of Reddick, an agent with the
Shafer-Pearson Agency.
   She said about 150 farmers rushed into her office before the
June 17 deadline. One applied for $1 million in insurance and paid
a $20,000 premium.
   ``There is real fear and panic,'' said McGinnis. ``One man said,
`The money I gave you tonight was as good an investment as I could
make in Las Vegas.'''
   Her agency advertised that the drought insurance would
``guarantee rain between June 1 and Aug. 31.''
   Agent Earl Blair of Chatsworth said farmers jammed into his
office and lined up on the street to buy the policy.
   ``It's about the greatest thing there is,'' said Blair. ``It's
just like you're house being on fire and we'll still insure you.''
   Farmers said agents cautioned them that they were merely
applying for the insurance, and that companies could reject their
requests.
   Iowa-based seed company Pioneer International acted as an agent
for the drought insurance, offering policies in Iowa, Indiana, Ohio
and Wisconsin, said spokesman Steve Daugherty. He said other
companies also offered the insurance in states like Illinois.
   Richard Carlson, assistant director of the Illinois Department
of Insurance, said the drought insurance was being offered by
Federal Insurance Co., part of the Chubb Group of Insurance
Companies.
   ``We've never approved the form, and we're not sure it's
insurance,'' said Carlson, who has asked to see the policy and meet
with company officials. ``It may be closer to gambling.''
   Mary Lu Korkuch, manager of promotion and public relations for
the Chubb Group, said company officials would discuss the situation
with the Illinois department but had no immediate response to
Carlson's comments.
   Carlson said his department could fine the company for selling
the drought insurance without approval, and could order refunds to
farmers who believed they were misled.
   ``Your crops could be dead in the field and the last day of the
policy it would rain a foot and you would not recover any money,''
said Beth Stuchel of the Iowa Division of Insurance. ``But we have
no problem with the company or what they are selling as long as the
farmers understand what they are buying.''
   The insurance works this way, McGinnis explained:
   A farmer in Kanakee County would pay a premium of $2.10 an acre
for a maximum payoff of $100 per acre if the county received no
more than 30 percent of its normal 90-day rainfall of 12.4 inches.
   The more rain, the smaller the payoff. More than half of normal
precipitation would mean no money for insured farmers.
   Premiums for Kankakee County were as much as $14 per acre,
depending on the level of coverage.

   Fire crews from both sides of the border
Sunday night battled a major blaze that heavily damaged a shopping
center injured seven Mexican firefighters before being brought
under control.
   The blaze was under control by 10 p.m., officials said.
   The blaze, visible from San Diego, began in a commercial
district about 6:30 p.m., destroying 15 to 16 buildings, including
clothing stores and other businesses, said Tijuana firefighter
Ruben Garcia.
   Seven firefighters suffered smoke inhalation while battling the
blaze and were sent to hospitals, Garcia said. Their conditions
were not immediately available.
   San Diego fire Capt. Ralph Haynes said the blaze had spread over
a two-block area and damaged a bank and an apartment complex.
   About 120 Mexican firefighters were sent to the scene, and 1{
hours later, six San Diego firefighters were dispatched, Haynes
said.
   Fire investigators had not determined the cause of the fire.
There were no damage estimates.

   Twenty years after anti-war demonstrations
polarized the nation, Americans remain deeply divided over whether
the protests changed society for better or for worse, a Media
General-Associated Press poll says.
   Nearly three-quarters of those questioned in the national survey
agreed that the anti-war protests had a lasting effect on society,
and a smaller majority said the movement forged lasting change in
U.S. foreign policy.
   But those who said the protests changed American society were
split on whether the impact was positive or negative: 51 percent
said positive and 41 percent said negative. The rest didn't know.
   The division was even more pronounced among those who said the
protests had a lasting effect on U.S. foreign policy: 47 percent
said the effect was positive and 45 percent said it was negative.
The poll's overall margin of error was 3 percentage points.
   The movement protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War
reached a crescendo in the summer of 1968, as demonstrators
occupied college campuses and battled with police during the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
   Two decades later, the Media General-AP poll found that
divisions over the protest movement in many cases remain.
   For example, a majority agreed that the protests influenced U.S.
policy in Vietnam, and 59 percent said the effect was to shorten
the nation's involvement in the war. But 23 percent said the
protests prolonged the war.
   In another measure, the respondents who thought the protests
influenced Vietnam policy were asked if the effect was to prevent
the United States from winning the war. Fifty-eight percent said
no, but 30 percent said yes.
   More people who identified themselves as conservatives said the
anti-war protests prevented the United States from winning in
Vietnam. Similarly, conservatives were more likely to say the
protests had a negative effect on American society and U.S. foreign
policy.
   Fifty-two percent of respondents said society is more liberal
now than 20 years ago. But few said they personally have become
more liberal; a greater share said they are more conservative and
the greatest share said their views are about the same.
   The respondents also subscribed to the view of young people
today as less activist and more self-interested than those in 1968.
More than 60 percent agreed with statements that young people
``were more interested in changing society'' and ``were more
idealistic'' 20 years ago; less than a third disagreed.
   Even more, 71 percent, agreed that ``young people are more
selfish now than they were 20 years ago,'' and just 23 percent
disagreed. Smaller majorities said the youth of 1988 are more
apathetic and at the same time more realistic than were their
counterparts 20 years ago.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204
adults. Media General Inc., a communications company based in
Richmond, Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond
News Leader, the Tampa (Fla). Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.)

   For a few days that tried her
soul, Kate Uhlir left her suburban Cleveland routine to witness
life in a Georgia prison and to share what was supposed to be a
death-row inmate's final hours.
   On June 16, Freddie Davis, Ms. Uhlir's longtime pen pal, was
spared from the electric chair, at least for 90 days. The Georgia
Board of Pardons and Paroles suspended his execution six hours
before it was to be carried out.
   ``I sort of felt like a soldier on an island with a bow and
arrow to defend the island and there were tanks coming at me,'' Ms.
Uhlir recalled.
   She was in a waiting area outside the prison with some of Davis'
family and friends when the small group of his supporters learned
his execution had been delayed.
   ``We jumped up and down and screamed,'' Ms. Uhlir said.
``Finally, we burst into tears. ... I put my arms around his
mother. Her whole body just shook ... It was something really
extraordinary.''
   The 49-year-old office manager and mother of six first wrote
Davis in 1980 after a friend involved in a Cincinnati-based program
called Prison Pen Pals gave her his name and address. She said she
knew nothing about him or his crime.
   Except for a period in 1986, when Ms. Uhlir was struggling with
a personal problem, she and Davis have written each other at least
once a month.
   She learned that Davis, now 31, was sentenced to die for the
Jan. 30, 1977, rape and stabbing death of Frances Rice Coe, a
Meriwether County, Ga., neighbor of co-defendant Eddie Spraggins.
   Spraggins also was convicted of murder and sentenced to death,
but won a new trial. He was the prime witness against Davis during
his 1977 trial.
   However, Spraggins said in an affidavit recently filed with the
Georgia Supreme Court that his testimony that Davis was in the room
with Mrs. Coe when she was killed was false.
   The affidavit supported Ms. Uhlir's belief that Davis is
innocent, developed over her years of correspondence with him.
   His letters to Ms. Uhlir gradually became more personal, and she
regularly wrote him about her children. In his letters, he called
her ``Sis.''
   Davis had been sentenced to die on Christmas Eve 1982, but was
granted a stay of execution.
   In his letters, he insisted that he killed no one but was
preparing to die.
   After learning that Davis had told his attorneys he wanted to
meet his pen pal, Ms. Uhlir traveled to the Georgia Diagnostic and
Classification Center, in Jackson, Ga. She met Davis for the first
time in the prison June 14.
   ``We held each other right in the hallway,'' she recalled. ``In
the room, there were two plastic molded chairs. He said, `Take your
pick.' One of the things I remember well is that he was covered
with sweat. But he was well-groomed and clean. He was warm and
gentlemanly.
   ``He said, `I'm not afraid to die, but I would like to die the
way God wants me to die.' ...
   ``He said, `I didn't kill her, Katey. I've never killed
anybody,' I said to him, `Couldn't you have stopped it?' He just
said, `I don't know.'''
   A federal appeals court refused to grant a stay of execution
before the parole board suspended the sentence.
   In its decision, the board said it had questions about Davis'
culpability, Spraggins' recantation and the new trial granted
Spraggins.
   ``The state Board of Pardons and Paroles will not have an
opportunity for a full and fair investigation ... unless the
execution ... is suspended,'' said board Chairman Wayne Snow.
   ``I believe that he didn't kill anybody,'' said Ms. Uhlir. ``He
knew there was still hope. Even in his letters, he never had any
false fantasies. But what's next for him? I'm afraid to say.''

<HEAD>New Neighbor Rescues 12 From Fire Next Door</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who moved into a house three
weeks ago met his next-door neighbors by rescuing 12 of them from a
burning home.
   Richard Castro, a 26-year-old truck driver, said he awoke at
5:30 a.m. Sunday to the sound of an explosion and breaking glass
coming from his neighbor's house.
   ``He just grabbed a fire extinguisher from the kitchen and ran
next door,'' said his wife, Laureen, 27.
   As Ms. Castro dialed 911, her husband used the extinguisher to
pound the door of Irma Uriarte's house.
   Unable to get a response, Castro smashed a window, unlatched the
door and entered.
   ``It was so smoky in there, I was dying for air,'' he said. ``I
kept having to step outside.''
   Castro then rousted the family out of their beds.
   ``I thought someone was going to rob the house,'' said John
Pereira, one of the Uriarte relatives who was in the house for a
family gathering. ``We got up when we heard the noise and then we
saw the smoke.''
   Castro found the origin of the fire _ a living-room lamp and
couch _ and put it out before helping the family outside.
   The neighbors formally met on the Uriarte lawn and Metro-Dade
firetrucks pulled up about 10 minutes later, Castro said.
   ``Mr. Castro is a hero,'' said Pereira, who came for the reunion
from his home in New York. ``If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be
here now.''
   Said Castro, ``I really don't feel like a hero. I was just doing
what felt natural. I'm just glad everyone is OK.''

   The dollar closed at its highest level this year
against the Japanese yen at the end of trading Monday, while stock
prices continued a downward swing.
   The dollar closed at 131.70 yen, up 2.00 yen from Friday's
close, to reach its highest closing since December. It opened at
131.00 yen and traded in a range between 130.75 and 131.70 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which fell 194.18 points during Saturday's half-day session,
declined another 121.20 points, or 0.44 percent, to close the day's
session at 27,435.01.
   Dealers said a stronger dollar in New York on Friday was
boosting the currency in Tokyo at the start of the trading week.
   ``There may be profit-taking selling pressure, but the dollar
will remain in an upward direction,'' said an exchange dealer with
a major commercial bank, who requested anonymity.
   The Bank of Japan has refrained from intervening in the market,
according to analysts, who said the central bank had been expected
to step in to slow the dollar's rise at a level around 130 yen.
   Although share prices were mixed on opening, they plunged in
morning dealings, depressed by the rising U.S. currency.
   ``Movements on the foreign exchange market are affecting share
prices,'' said a trader with a Japanese security house in Tokyo.
``It's a strong trend, and we have to wait as the market corrects
itself,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

that crashed in eastern France on Sunday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MANUFACTURER: Airbus Industrie, a Toulouse, France-based
European consortium. First test-flown on Feb. 22, 1987, the plane
was certified on Feb. 26.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CAPACITY: Normally seats 150 passengers but can carry up to 179.
Carries a crew of two on the flight deck, with one (optionally two)
additional crew members. Four flight attendants.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DIMENSIONS: A 111-foot wingspan, overall length of 123 feet and
height of 38 feet. The wheelbase is 41 feet. Passenger doors are
front and aft on the port side, with two emergency exits over wings
on both sides.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SPECIAL FACTS: Has a range of about 3,700 miles and consumes 40
percent less fuel than similar two or three engine jets.
   It is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully
computerized flight-control system the manufacturer says permits
safer, electronically controlled flight. Instead of the old control
column in front of the pilot, there is a ``pistol-grip'' side stick
linked to five computers that modify and relay the pilot's
directions to wing and tail flaps.
   Airbus Industrie has 500 orders to purchase the craft, which
cost about $60 million each.

<HEAD>Flood Death Toll Rises To 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight more people have died in
flood-related accidents in Bangladesh, raising the death toll in
the past week to at least 17, officials and press reports said
today.
   Seven fishermen drowned after being swept into the Bay of Bengal
early Sunday when an embankment crumbled under the pressure of
flood waters, officials in the port city of Chittagong said.
   Another person was killed Sunday when a mudslide buried his
house in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Nine people died in floods earlier last week.
   Officials in Dhaka said rail and road links between the capital
and the northern Sylhet and Sunamganj districts _ hardest hit by
the floods _ have been disrupted by the swirling waters.
   All trains running between Sylhet and Dhaka have been canceled,
they added.
   Ittefaq, a Bengali-language newspaper, said floods have stranded
more than 500,000 people in the remote areas of northern Netrokona
district.
   Rescue teams have been evacuating the people to government
shelters, mostly by boat, the newspaper said.
   Thousands of homes have been destroyed in the region, Ittefaq
reported.
   Most of the victims are poor people who live and farm in
low-lying areas that are flooded when Bangladesh's many rivers
overflow during the annual monsoon rains.
   Earlier this month, at least 25 people died in the first spate
of monsoon-related flooding, according to official count.
Unofficial reports put the figure at 50.
   More than 1,200 people were killed last year in devastating
floods that destroyed crops the government said could have yield
3.4 million tons of rice for this impoverished, food-importing
nation of 105 million people.

<HEAD>Barge Traffic Delays Cause Grain Pileups</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Drought-Insurance, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOUND CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This community on the banks of the Ohio
River is living up to its name in an unexpected way: Piles of grain
valued at almost $1 million are heaped on its streets because of
drought-stranded barge traffic.
   The off-and-on closure of the river from Cairo to about 10 miles
north of Mound City, whose top industry is grain storage and
shipment, has made it tough to find empty barges to haul the grain.
   And the ones that are available cannot be stocked to capacity
because the Coast Guard has placed tonnage limitations on tow sizes
in hopes of avoiding vessel groundings.
   Dozens of towboats, which need a minimum depth of 9 feet, have
run aground in recent weeks because of fast-sinking water levels
and shoaling, a buildup of silt deposits caused by slow-flowing
water.
   ``How do you get the barges in if the river's close and they
can't move?'' asked Robert Hudson of ADM Growmark in Mound City.
``You have to bring them in by helicopter.''
   ADM Growmark, along with two other grain operators here, began
dumping grain on city streets near the river about two weeks ago.
Hudson said ADM will hold the grain rather than move it by rail to
save money.
   He estimated rail costs at 50 percent more than the highest
barge freight rates.
   Since the drought began taking its toll, barge operators have
doubled the average bulk commodity rates, to about $14 a ton, said
Robert Gardner of Conti Carriers and Terminals, a unit of
Chicago-based Continental Grain Co., the nation's fifth largest
barge company.
   ``I think a lot of people underestimate this industry,'' Gardner
said. ``It's resilient and it's able to cope with problems of this
nature. We're pretty resourceful.''
   By the middle of last week, about 200,000 bushels of grain
created huge mounds in Mound City and trucks continued to dump
more. Hudson estimated its worth at $700,000.
   The Coast Guard said barge traffic along the river, where depths
were only 6 feet in spots, remained limited during the weekend.
Sand bars, some larger than a football field, have forced closure
of the river to allow dredging.
   The pileup, Hudson estimated, will cost local grain operators
about $6,000 a month. But Hudson and other industry officials say
they've weathered tough times before.
   ``We take economic chances from time to time,'' said Gardner.
``We do it with the weather as well. All in all,'' he said, ``what
it does is slow things down a little bit.''
   Hudson noted, for example, that barges are still loading,
however slowly.
   Officials call the southern edge of the Ohio one of the nation's
most treacherous inland waterways because of its shallow waters.
   If a boat runs aground or rams the banks of the narrowing
channel, its barges can break up and float down river, possibly
damaging other vessels.
   At midweek, hundreds of barges were stranded on the Ohio. On
Sunday, 54 barges were waiting to go downriver, the Coast Guard
said.
   The delay meant up to $10,000 a day for each idled towboat
because of the costs of labor, gasoline and lost business.
   And Chuck Shumann, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman in
Louisville, Ky., warned last week: ``If the drought continues and
we do not get additional water in the river, there will be
additional dredging. In the worst we could have more severe
problems of boats getting through.''

   American soprano Grace Bumbry sang the first two

   Bulgarian Ghena Dimitrova took over the role of the Ethiopian

   Miss Bumbry had been suffering from tonsillitis and hay fever,

   She sang the first two acts in good voice but at the end of the
second act the audience was told she was indisposed and unable to
continue. Miss Dimitrova, due to sing the lead role tonight, was in
the audience and quickly responded to Miss Bumbry's call for help,
an opera spokeswoman said.
   The audience gave Miss Dimitrova cheers and rousing applause.

   The dollar jumped to its highest closing level this
year against the Japanese yen today, while stocks slumped in
moderate trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar surged to end the day's session at 131.70 yen, up
2.00 yen from Friday's close. It opened at 131.00 yen and was
traded between 130.75 and 131.70 yen.
   ``The market is taking its cue from gains in overseas currency
dealings,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. ``In particular,
the dollar rose sharply against the (West German) mark, and that's
moving the market here,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Today's closing was the highest since Dec. 10, when the currency
ended trading at 132.18 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
a 194.18-point loser during Saturday's half-day session, fell
another 121.20 points, or 0.44 percent, to close the day at
27,435.01.
   Volume traded on the first section reached about 850 million
shares, compared to the 600 million traded over the half-day
session on Saturday.
   Some traders said the market was reflecting concern over the
influence of the stronger dollar on Japanese prices and interest
rates. Others said the losses more likely stemmed from a correction
after sharp market gains this year.

   The millions of people who live in Eastern Europe
could not send delegates to the Communist Party conference that
begins Tuesday, but will certainly be watching it closely.
   The Kremlin sets the tone for reform in its Warsaw Pact allies,
and is now increasing pressure on those countries' Communist
leaders to follow Mikhail S. Gorbachev's lead.
   Because the extraordinary 5,000-delegate conference is not a
regular party congress, East bloc leaders will not get their
traditional invitation to sit in on the proceedings. But they are
sure to pay close attention.
   Gorbachev's opening speech is to be carried live by East bloc
television. East Europeans will also be tuning in for nightly
bulletins on the conference or scurrying out in the morning to buy
Soviet dailies that now sell out fast at the news stand.
   With Moscow now insisting publicly that its allies are free to
dictate their own reforms at their own pace, East bloc officials
are reluctant to admit openly that the outcome of the Soviet party
conference will have any bearing on their own policies.
   But in Prague, for example, officials privately admit they are
waiting to see whether Gorbachev will strengthen his hand.
   If the Kremlin leader gets a mandate for more radical reform, it
put the heat on Czechoslovakia's leaders _ installed after Moscow
crushed Gorbachev-like reforms with tanks 20 years ago _ to allow
some liberalization.
   Similar pressure might also arise in Bulgaria, where the wily
Todor Zhivkov, 76, has been in power since 1954 and skillfully pays
lip service to reforms while making changes in the economy that
have been chaotic.
   Poland and Hungary have gone furthest in matching or even
exceeding Gorbachev's reforms in the economic and political realms.
   In Budapest, officials openly boast now of great support from
the Soviets for their reforms, and accordingly have voiced the
greatest concern that Soviet proponents of change are not
well-placed to prevail at this week's conference.
   ``The fact is, the supporters of the new line cannot feel that
their position is safe at the party conference,'' the Hungarian
government daily Magyar Hirlap wrote last week.
   ``The open or covert opposition _ the more conservative elements
of the apparatchiks, the bureaucrats and the undecided _ will make
their presence felt as they did when the delegates were elected,''
the paper said.
   In Poland, the subject of the Soviet Union and its future comes
up in almost every conversation about the Poles' own future.
   An opposition platform partially published by the independent
Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny two weeks ago noted that
``chances for reform can be considered as growing'' as Gorbachev's
campaign crystalizes and ``will weaken the position of conservative
elements'' among Poland's ruling Communists.
   Soviet reforms have received scant attention in the official
media in East Germany and Romania, whose Communist leaders so far
have rejected any need to follow suit.
   But East German youth have shouted ``Gorbachev, Gorbachev'' when
protesting police attempts to disperse young rock fans at the
Berlin Wall.
   Romania's 23 million citizens are largely preoccupied in coping
with severe food shortages. But they paid close attention to a
visit from Gorbachev 13 months ago that offered them their only
chance to date to hear a long, televised speech by the Soviet
leader.
   All of eastern Europe's Communist leaders _ many now more
secretive and orthodox their Kremlin counterparts _ will closely
follow conference debate over the Stalinist past and the need to
open up Communist Party life.
   As Warsaw Pact allies embroiled in a fierce dispute over the
treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Romania, Hungary and Romania are
likely to take a special interest in the ethnic unrest that has
recently flared in the Soviet Union.
   Demands will be presented from the three Soviet Baltic republics
for more genuine autonomy from Moscow. The situation in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian enclave in the southern republic of
Azerbaijan that has demanded unification with Armenia, is also
likely to be debated.
   The Soviet Union has been at pains not to interfere openly in
the Hungarian-Romanian dispute.
   But any sign that Moscow might concede to the Baltic demands for
a greater role for their indigenous languages and culture would
certainly strengthen the hand of the Hungarians who demand an end
to alleged discrimination against the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians
living in Romania.

   The Airbus A320 jetliner that crashed in eastern
France during a demonstration flight had been set aloft with praise
for its advanced technology, but it also flew into an international
trade dispute.
   When the narrow-bodied 168-passenger Airbus A320 went into
service last month, it was touted for its computerized
flight-control system and fuel efficiency.
   Its maker, Airbus Industrie, said it has more than 500 firm
orders or letters of intent to purchase the A320, which uses 40
percent less fuel that similar aircraft and is already the fastest
selling plane in aviation history.
   But Sunday's crash, which killed three passengers and injured
50, raised questions about the twin-engine plane's safety.
   When the plane made its maiden flight for Air France over the
French capital last month, then-Premier Jacques Chirac called it
``the most modern plane in the world.''
   And Airbus Industrie, a four-nation European consortium based in
Toulouse that builds two other planes, plans a stretch version of
the A320 for 1993, as well as a four-engine, long-range version.
   Owned by aerospace companies from Britain, France, West Germany
and Spain, the company is widely regarded as a triumph of European
industrial and technical collaboration.
   In its 20 years, Airbus has carved out a substantial share of
the big-money, high-risk world commercial airline market dominated
by U.S. manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
   Airbus planes are in service with 61 airlines around the world.
   But they planes have kicked up a trans-Atlantic storm over U.S.
complaints of government subsidies for Airbus. In April, U.S. trade
representative Clayton Yeutter warned the governments of the
four-nation consortium to reduce support for Airbus or face a trade
war.
   He accused the four of trying to divert attention from their own
direct subsidies by criticizing the U.S. defense programs for
supporting the U.S. airline industry.
   ``The central issue under discussion is subsidies for the
development of commercial projects, not the amount of money
American taxpayers spend in defense of the free world,'' Yeutter
said.
   But Airbus Industrie countered that U.S. funds are actually
intended ``to perpetuate U.S. dominance of the world market for
civilian aircraft.''

<HEAD>Doctors Debate Proposals On AIDS, Medicaid Reform At AMA
Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

   American Medical Association delegates today
gathered to debate proposals for battling AIDS by testing all
immigrants and inmates, overhauling Medicaid and creating a type of
hospital worker to replace nurses.
   The annual policymaking meeting runs through Thursday and was
expected to attract up to 2,000 doctors from across the country.
The 420 doctors who are official delegates represent the
association's estimated 295,000 members and act as a legislature,
debating and setting policy for the nation's largest organization
of physicians.
   Today, the delegates were scheduled to debate 101 reports on
problems including child pornography and the health hazards of
clove cigarettes, and to consider more than 200 resolutions on such
issues as the health risks of tanning parlors and the need to
revamp the nation's Medicare health insurance system for the
elderly.
   Other proposals to be considered by the organization's House of
Delegates included banning plastic handguns, putting warning labels
on alcoholic beverages and clarifying the AMA's stand on mercy
killing.
   ``We take an open, liberal policy on resolutions and will
consider anything that we feel affects the public's health,'' said
Dr. William Hotchkiss, whose term as AMA president is ending.
   Hotchkiss said before the convention began that he expected the
AIDS epidemic, and how to combat it, would prompt detailed
discussion.
   ``AIDS, of course, is the biggest threatening health problem in
the United States. There is still considerable debate that I think
will take place over the issue of testing,'' said Hotchkiss, a
thoracic surgeon from Chesapeake, Va.
   One resolution up for debate today recommends requiring state
and local health departments to notify the sexual partners of
anyone who tests positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. The
proposal also calls on the AMA to recommend that all immigrants and
prison inmates be tested for exposure to the virus that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The AMA Board of Trustees' also is proposing a massive overhaul
of Medicaid, the nation's program for helping the poor pay for
medical care.
   A report for the convention says the Medicaid program is marred
by ``severe inequities'' nationwide and is ``in desperate need of
reform.''
   It proposes extending benefits to an additional 27 million
people and raising the annual cost of Medicaid by about $24 billion.
   A battle may erupt over the AMA's proposal to help offset the
nationwide shortage of nurses by creating a new class of hospital
workers to provide some bedside care to patients.
   The American Nurses' Association opposes the plan to create
licensed ``registered care technologists.'' Under the plan, high
school graduates could begin caring for patients as assistant
technologists with two months' training.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldiers Wreck Home of Arab Stabbing Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers today demolished the home of an Arab
suspected of stabbing a Jewish settler and police strengthened
their ranks in Jerusalem, where underground leaders urged an
escalation of the Palestinian uprising.
   Also, Israeli troops closed more than 40 Palestinian schools in
the West Bank city of Nablus, citing repeated stone-throwing
incidents in the area in recent days. The army said the schools
would be closed at least several days.
   The bulldozed house belonged to Abdel Majid Sharawne, 22.
American-born settler Yohan Chaiken said he chased and shot
Sharawne Friday after the Palestinian stabbed him in the West Bank
city of Hebron.
   Sharawne's home was the second building wrecked by Israeli
authorities in two days. On Sunday, the army blew up the second
story of a building in the occupied Gaza Strip, where it said
assailants threw a firebomb that badly burned two of its soldiers
last week.
   Five hundred extra police officers were put on alert in the
mixed Jewish-Arab city of Jerusalem today to confront expected
protests called in the latest leaflet distributed by underground
leaders allied with the Palestine Liberation Organization, said
city police spokesman Rafi Levy.
   Israeli news reports said 1,500 police in all were stationed in
the city.
   The leaflet said Palestinians should mark today and Tuesday as
``days for the escalation of the struggle.'' It said they should
march in Jerusalem, which it called ``the capital of the
Palestinian state.''
   The call was meant to protest Israel's annexation of the Arab
sector of Jerusalem a few days after it was captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel also seized the Gaza Strip
and West Bank.
   According to U.N. figures, 211 Palestinians and four Israelis
have died in the anti-occupation uprising that began Dec. 8.
   Underground leaders also urged merchants to take part in a
general strike on Tuesday ``in affirmation of the Arab identity of
the city (of Jerusalem).''
   Police have recently rounded up Palestinian guerrilla suspects
from Jerusalem's walled Old City, most of whom are aged 17 to 23
and believed responsible for a rash of recent firebomb attacks in
the city, the mass-circulation daily Maariv said.
   In another development, the army said it was investigating
allegations that soldiers used hypodermic needles to inject two
Palestinian men in the Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah on the
West Bank to pry information about stone-throwers from them.
   Nader Mahli, 24, said soldiers seized him Friday and gave him an
injection while they asked him for the names of stone-throwers and
members of the Shabiba, a PLO youth movement.
   Masaad Jaber, a driver for the United Nations, said soldiers
also forced his son, Midhad, to receive an injection during an
interrogation.
   One Palestinian showed reporters needle marks in his arm that he
said was caused by the hypodermics.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israeli troops clamped curfews on
the Beach camp and a portion of the Jabaliya camp after an Israeli
car was stoned and set ablaze in the nearby Beit Lahiya
neighborhood on Sunday, Israel radio reported.
   On Sunday, a fire damaged the Hassan Bek mosque in the seaside
port of Jaffa near Tel Aviv.
   Moslem leaders said the attack appeared to be the work of Jews
seeking revenge for fires that have razed more than 35,000 acres of
trees and farmland in Israel since May. Palestinian arsonists are
suspected in those fires.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Leon Sullivan, who wrote the
guidelines for U.S. companies doing business with South Africa,
exhorted his congregation to advance through work and faith as he
bid farewell to the church he led 38 years.
   ``Use what you have, and with self-help you can do anything you
want to do. You can climb any mountain, you can cross any stream,
you can follow the rainbow and you can find your dream. Self
Help,'' he shouted to the more than 2,500 people who jammed into
the Zion Baptist Church. ``Self help. Self Help.'' Sullivan, who
will remain pastor emeritus at the predominantly black
congregation, also spoke of his ambitious plans to work in
education and development in Africa.
   The 65-year-old minister is perhaps best known for the
``Sullivan Principles,'' a code of conduct he wrote in 1977 for
companies doing business with white-ruled South Africa. Sullivan
had been speaking out against apartheid since the early 1960s, when
his success as an innovative community leader led to his receiving
a post on the board of directors of General Motors.
   Sullivan gained attention for his Opportunities
Industrialization Center, which he founded in 1964. The
Philadelphia-based center, emphasizing the self-help philosophy,
now has 12 branches in Africa.
   Sullivan said those branches would be used for his program to
help Africans.
   Sullivan said he would build schools that would ``train tens of
millions of people in Africa.'' He said those who might be
skeptical about that figure should remember, ``Nothing is too big
with God.''
   Much of the work will be implemented through the International
Foundation for Education and Self-Help, a foundation Sullivan has
established. Sullivan said he plans to move to Phoenix, Ariz.,
where the foundation will be headquartered.
   Sullivan will be replaced as pastor at Zion by Rev. Gus Roman of
Berean Missionary Baptist Church in New York.

   Sneakers probably saved a teen-age
girl whose boyfriend died after the couple was struck by lightning
as they walked hand-in-hand through a hay field, authorities said.
   Shioban Ludwig, 19, was critically injured after she was struck
in the chest, authorities said. The bolt passed through her body
and then struck Anthony Cretella, 17, of East Haven in the head,
killing him instantly, police said.
   ``The only reason she's alive is that she was wearing sneakers
with rubber soles and he wasn't,'' said police dispatcher Phyllis
Dunphy.
   A resident heard Ludwig's cries for help around 2:30 a.m. Sunday
and called police, who found the woman crawling through the field.
Cretella was found face down where he was hit, Dunphy said.
   Ludwig was in critical condition but stable condition Sunday
night at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven with first-degree
burns and possible internal injuries, a hospital official said.

<HEAD>Prices Dip Despite Summer Vacation Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices bucked a summer trend and
dipped a quarter of a cent a gallon during the last two weeks,
according to a nationwide survey of more than 12,000 stations.
   The Lundberg Survey said the average price of all grades of
gasoline offered at all types of service stations was 99.98 cents
as of Friday, down from the June 10 average price of $1.0023 per
gallon.
   The average price was down nearly a full cent from comparable
June 1987 prices, according to the survey released Sunday.
   ``It is untypical for retail prices to be falling at this time
of year,'' when the demand from vacationing motorists usually pulls
up the price, said survey director Trilby Lundberg.
   She blamed the dip on competition between dealers and price
instablity on the global oil market.
   The survey found that average prices at self-serve pumps as of
Friday were: regular unleaded, 90.84 cents a gallon; premium
unleaded, $1.056 a gallon; and regular leaded, 88.09 cents a
gallon. Self-service pumps account for eight of every 10 gallons of
gasoline sold.
   At full service pumps, the average prices were: regular
unleaded, $1.1964; premium unleaded $1.2978; and regular leaded
$1.1592.

   Firefighters from both sides of the
U.S.-Mexican border battled a raging blaze that heavily damaged a
shopping center in this popular tourist city, authorities said.
   The blaze broke out in the one-story Centro Commercial Blanco
Libertad shortly before 6:30 p.m. Sunday and destroyed up to 16
businesses, said Tijuana Fire Department dispatcher Ruben Garcia.
   Firefighters from San Diego and the Mexican cities of Tecate and
Rosarito Beach helped bring the blaze under control within 2{
hours, Garcia said.
   Assistant Tijuana fire Chief Jose Carreno said fire hydrants in
the area did not work and water had to be hauled in.
   Some of the water used to fight the blaze was brought in from
San Diego, about 15 miles away, said San Diego fire Capt. Ralph
Haynes.
   Seven Tijuana firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation at
the scene, Garcia said.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation and there were no
damage estimates.

   Rudolf Nureyev will belatedly celebrate his 50th
birthday tonight in the company of fellow ballet greats such as
Dame Margot Fonteyn and some not-so-greats, such as the prima
ballerina Miss Piggy of ``Swine Lake'' fame.
   The Paris Opera Ballet, directed by Nureyev since 1983, will
perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in honor of the dancer's
birthday, albeit three months and 10 days after he reached half a
century.
   Nureyev's impact was first felt in 1961, when he bolted from the
Kirov Ballet, a Soviet company visiting Paris at the time, and
defected.
   Nureyev is credited with breaking molds within tradition and
blending a sensuality with disciplined virtuosity.

<HEAD>U.N. Disarmament Session Fails To Adopt Final Resolution On Arms
Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a month of speeches and debate on
disarmament, U.N. delegates were unable to agree on the future
direction of arms control and adjourned their special General
Assembly session in failure.
   Many of the 135 speakers at the session hailed the recent
U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap all intermediate-range nuclear
missiles. Yet they were unable to emulate the superpowers and
overcome national policy differences.
   Different nations and regional groups held a variety of
conflicting views. But the crucial rift developed between sweeping
proposals advanced by the Soviet Union and developing nations and a
more cautious approach backed by the United States and some of its
Western allies.
   Delegates clashed in debate over issues such as the U.S.
space-based missile defense system known as ``Star Wars,'' U.N.
monitoring of land-based weapons and disarmament, and a Soviet call
for a joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban.
   By Sunday morning, they gave up the attempt to write a mutually
acceptable document. No vote was attempted on the final resolution.
   The 159-member General Assembly has no enforcement power over
its decisions. But delegates believed a final resolution adopted by
consensus, would carry moral authority by expressing the will of
the world community.
   Chinese delegate Yu Mengyia seemed to blame the United States
when he said: ``A certain country which should have important
disarmament responsibilities had insisted on its position. That was
a major reason that consensus was not achieved.''
   Speaking for the Soviet Union, Vladimir F. Petrovsky said only
that no consensus was possible ``because of the actions of some
states.''
   U.S. delegate Max Friedersdorf said his country ``regretted very
much that it had not been possible to achieve consensus on the
chairman's draft document, which had been acceptable in large part
to most delegations.''
   The delegates attempted to rewrite the final document
unanimously approved at the first special General Assembly session
on disarmament 10 years ago, a utopian resolution that many nations
consider an important outline of the goal of a weapons-free world.
   An attempt to revise the document at the second special session
on disarmament in 1982 ended in disagreement.
   American and some other Western allies indicated during the
latest session that they would reject any document that did not
address basic concerns of the West, including:
   _ spiraling military spending by developing nations. Western
delegates said those funds would be better spent on economic
development, education and health care;
   _ the emergence of regional powers as major factors in
militarization and instability, such as Iran and Iraq, and India
and Pakistan. Virtually all wars since World War II have been
fought among developing nations;
   _ recognizing that the United States and the Soviet Union have
made progress on disarmament and stating that such treaties are a
strictly bilateral matter, as U.S. Secretary of Shultz George
Shultz told the special session.
   In addition, the United States favored emphasis on conventional
disarmament, especially in Europe where the Warsaw Pact is regarded
as stronger than NATO in such forces.
   In his speech to the session, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze called for elimination of all nuclear weapons by the
end of the century, troop reductions of 500,000 soldiers each by
the Warsaw Pact and NATO, and a joint U.S.-Soviet nuclear test ban.
   The Soviets and the developing nations also favored an expanded
role for the United Nations in arms control monitoring and an
international naval force under U.N. control, which the United
States opposes.
   Non-aligned nations further wanted to identify Israel and South
Africa as regional offenders in the final document, another bone of
contention with the West.
   The special session cost the financially ailing world body $7.4
million.

<HEAD>Pope Condemns Inter-Catholic Clashes in Face of Schism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today denounced
``bitter confrontations'' among Roman Catholics as a historic
schism loomed between the Church and its traditionalists.
   The Church's first break in more than a century could open if
traditionalist French archbishop Marcel Lefebvre goes ahead with
the consecration of four bishops in Switzerland over the Vatican's
objections.
   The action, threatened for Thursday, would mean automatic
excommunication for Lefebvre under Roman Catholic law.
   Also today, the pope, who was finishing his five-day tour of
Austria, issued special greetings to controversial President Kurt
Waldheim.
   The president has been accused of complicity in Nazi atrocities
during World War II, but denies any wrongdoing. The pope has met
with Waldheim during the visit, which has focused heavily on the
horror of the Nazi era.
   Speaking today to a crowd of 38,000, many clad in traditional
mountain peasant outfits, John Paul cited ``growing lack of
communications among generations, numerous divorces, suicides
including those among young people, all-out fights among
politicians and parties, bitter confrontation among Christians
themselves, cynical criticism of the church even in the church's
own publications.''
   ``These are all warning signs that God's command and the joyful
message of Christ for many are no longer the basis of their
behavior,'' the pontiff added.
   After his return to Rome today, the pontiff is expected to make
another attempt to head off what would be the church's first schism
since 1870.
   Lefebvre has announced his intention to consecrate four bishops
in Econe, Switzerland, on Thursday in defiance of the Vatican.
   ``A lot of people believe in tradition but not in rupture,''
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters in Salzburg on
Sunday.
   Navarro said the Vatican has received indications that only
about 20 percent of Lefebvre's followers would remain loyal to the
82-year-old prelate should he defy the pope.
   The Vatican spokesman estimated that Lefebvre has between 80,000
and 100,000 followers. But other Vatican officials say as many as
half a million Catholics around the world turn to tradionalist
priests for various church functions.
   Earlier, the Vatican's No. 2 official, Secretary of State
Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, called the impending schism a ``painful
wound'' and ``a break that could not be immediately repairable.''
   ``I am certain he will not have a large following and that
people will understand the pope has done all he could to avoid
it,'' the Italian prelate told reporters.
   Also Sunday, conservative Austrian Bishop Kurt Krenn said an
official of Lefebvre's Pius X Fraternity had given him a message
saying, in essence, ``we don't want a schism and hope that a
peaceful solution can be found.''
   Krenn said he relayed the message to the pope through a Vatican
intermediary.
   A compromise solution reached by the two sides last month fell
apart, and Lefebvre said he intended to go ahead and consecrate the
four bishops: a Swiss, a Frenchman, an Argentine and an American.
   The Pius X Fraternity, headquartered in Econe, claims to have
250 priests and 280 seminarians.
   The traditionalists reject many of the reforms approved by the
Second Vatican Council of 1962-65 and celebrate the Tridentine
Latin Mass, for which special Vatican approval is required.
   The last schism in the church involved the so-called ``Old
Catholics'' who broke with the Vatican in 1870 after the First
Vatican Council proclaimed the infallibility of the pope.
   Waldheim was in the audience at Innsbruck's Bergisel stadium for
this morning's Mass, during which the pope said: ``I greet the
esteemed representatives from the civil and governmental area,
especially among them the federal president and the two state
governors from the western part of Austria.''
   As the pope cited Waldheim, the crowd broke into applause while
Austrian television focused on the president and his wife,
Elisabeth.
   Waldheim was scheduled to wish the pontiff farewell at the end
of the trip tonight at Innsbruck airport.
   John Paul angered some Jewish leaders by meeting with Waldheim
at the start of his trip Thursday.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher But Off Best Levels On Profit-Taking, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in early European trading today
but dealers said it was off its best levels because of
profit-taking.
   Gold prices were slightly lower in quiet trading.
   Despite the dollar's slight retreat at midmorning, dealers
predicted it would continue to rise.
   ``There's been a complete reversal in trend against the
dollar,'' said one trader with a major Italian commercial bank.
   Traders said the absence of central bank intervention in the
market and heavy demand for dollars by Japanese financial
institutions had sparked the dollar's sudden advance.
   A trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said leaders of the seven
major industrialized nations attending last week's economic summit
in Toronto ``probably agreed to do nothing, or let the dollar drift
up.''
   ``The only thing that will stop the dollar from going up at the
moment is a central bank intervention,'' said another trader. ``And
even then, only intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve would be
taken as a serious signal'' that the dollar shouldn't climb higher.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 2.00 yen to a closing 131.70. Later, in
London, it was quoted lower at 130.99 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates:
   _ 1.8245 West German marks, up from 1.8010
   _ 1.5078 Swiss francs, up from 1.4945
   _ 6.1380 French francs, up from 6.0635
   _ 2.0581 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0305
   _ 1,351.25 Italian lire, up from 1,330.37
   _ 1.20995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2050
   In London, the dollar rose strongly against the British pound.
It cost $1.7158 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7430 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $442.60 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $442.00. Both were down from Friday's late bid
of $442.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $442.00, down from $442.90 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.55 to close at a bid $444.14.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.85 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's late bid of $6.84.

<HEAD>PLO Dissidents Overrun Arafat Loyalists in Rufugee Camp</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian-allied Palestinian dissidents
backed by a fierce artillery barrage today overran a Beirut refugee
camp and trapped Yasser Arafat loyalists in their final local
pocket of resistance.
   Police said 40 fighters loyal to the Palestine Liberation
Organization chief surrendered. Up to 160 others remained pinned
down awaiting possible safe passage out of the Chatilla camp.
   Seven people were killed and 11 wounded in the latest
hostilities between fighters of Col. Saeed Mousa's breakaway
Fatah-Uprising and Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in Chatilla
and the nearby Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp.
   A Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the dissidents seized control of Chatilla this morning after
they leveled what was left of the nearly half-mile square
shantytown in a sustained barrage of 25 shells a minute.
   Black smoke billowed from the two camps as the fighting raged
through the morning with the boom of shell blasts shaking the
Lebanese capital.
   ``You have a last chance to surrender and turn yourselves in to
the Syrian army or face a final onslaught,'' the dissident command
said in a statement communicated to the encircled loyalists. No
deadline was set.
   Fatah admitted that the dissidents had stormed Chatilla and
captured two of four bases seized by Arafat's men a month ago.
   The 40 who surrendered left with their hands clasped behind
their heads. Syrian army officers and Libyan mediators took charge
of them, police said.
   The remaining loyalists stopped firing but remained in their
position waiting for Syrian and Libyan mediators to arrange safe
conduct.
   The 40 guerrillas and others still trapped inside Chatilla would
probably be sent to the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts
of southern Lebanon's port city of Sidon, Palestinian and Lebanese
police sources said.
   That camp is controlled by mainstream PLO guerrillas.
   In all, 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since May 1,
when the rival factions began fighting for control of the two camps
on Beirut's southern outskirts.
   A PLO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Abdul-Amir Abbas, a Lebanese mediator, planned to enter Chatilla
later today to try to persuade Arafat's loyalists to lay down arms
and evacuate the camp.
   The official said the loyalists were willing to abandon the camp
if the Syrian army gives them safe conduct to refugee camps in
south Lebanon.
   Syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and
south Beirut. But the soldiers, who ring Chatilla and Bourj
el-Barajneh, have made no move to stop the Palestinian factional
fighting.
   The battles flared despite a reconciliation between Arafat and
Syrian President Hafez Assad in April after a five-year feud over
control of the Palestinian movement.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's second highest military leader
will visit the United States during the first two weeks of July,
Tass said today.
   The official news agency said Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev,
chief of staff and first deputy defense minister, will make the
trip at the invitation of Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staffs.
   Akhromeyev was Washington in early December for the summit
between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan.
   The invitation is the result of an agreement announced by the
countries' two defense chiefs in March to expand military contacts
and exchanges of information between U.S. and Soviet officials on
force strengths.
   The agreement was part of a joint statement by Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci and Soviet Defense Minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov after
a meeting in Bern, Switzerland believed to be the first such
session between the countries' defense ministers since World War II.
   Tass did not give Akhromeyev's exact departure date or details
of his schedule.

<TEXT>
   A valedictorian who killed his mother
with a baseball bat only 10 hours before he was to graduate from
high school said she wouldn't ``give him any freedom,'' police said.
   William Shrubsall, 17, was to be arraigned today on a charge of
second-degree murder. He was being held in the city jail without
bail.
   Shrubsall beat his 56-year-old mother, Marianne, to death
Saturday morning after an argument over his late return from his
girlfriend's house, Detective Lt. Richard Clute said.
   Friends and neighbors reacted with disbelief that Shrubsall, who
was bound for the University of Chicago this fall, could have
committed the crime.
   ``You can't say anything bad about him ... he was just super
nice,'' said neighbor Darlene Irish. ``Whenever his mother said
anything he did it just like that.''
   ``He had everything going for him,'' said classmate Terry
Adamec. ``He was the smartest guy in the whole school,''
   However, Shrubsall's attorney, Paul Cleary, said there was a
history of problems between mother and son. ``He made a detailed
statement of that to police and it will come out in court,'' Cleary
said.
   Mrs. Shrubsall, who weighed close to 300 pounds, had beaten the
teen-ager before, said The Buffalo News, quoting an unidentified
source. Despite the boy's success, she pressured him to do more,
the source said.
   ``He claimed his mother wouldn't give him any freedom,'' Clute
said.
   They had lived alone in their well-kept suburban home since
Shrubsall's father, William, Sr., died in 1985, police said.
   Before the killing, Mrs. Shrubsall called the girl's home
demanding that her son return home, police said. She was waiting
for him in the driveway, where the argument began.
   The two went inside and Mrs. Shrubsall threatened to call the
girl's parents. When Shrubsall tried to prevent her from using the
phone, she struck him in the face with the receiver, police said.
   Shrubsall went to his room and got the bat. The killing occurred
in a hallway outside his room, police said.
   School officials passed over the scheduled valedictory speech,
and made no mention of Shrubsall during Saturday's graduation.

<HEAD>British Airways Returns A320 Jets To Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-France-Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways said today it is satisfied the
A320 Airbus is safe and will return to service the two jets it
withdrew after the crash of an Air France model of the plane on
Sunday.
   British Airways suspended service of its two A320 jets at
midnight Sunday while waiting for information about the cause of
the crash near the Swiss-French border which killed three people.
   Following discussions with Airbus Industrie, the plane's
manufacturer, and Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, British
Airways said it will on Tuesday resume its A320 service between
London's Gatwick Airport and various European destinations.
   ``We are satisfied with the safety and operating integrity of
the aircraft,'' said an airline spokesman, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom.
   Michael Hennell, a professor of computational mathematics at
Liverpool University, said he has been warning authorities since
last year about flaws in the A320, the first civilian airliner with
a fully computerized flight-control system that performs many tasks
previously done by pilots.
   The system replaces the pilot's control stick with a series of
computers and miles of electronic cables. Instead of the pilot
physically moving the stick to adjust the aircraft's flaps, for
example, computers are used to send an electronic signal to the
flaps.
   Airbus Industrie maintains the system permits safer,
electronically controlled flight, but Hennell said it does not
always allow the pilot to override the computer. Airbus is a
four-nation consortium in which Britain has a large stake.
   ``The pilot has very little last say,'' Hennell said. ``It is
the computer that really determines what is to happen and that is
to avoid pilot error.
   ``Computers control almost every aspect of this aircraft. It is
very hard to see what could have happened that couldn't be laid at
the door of one of the computers.''
   Hennell has campaigned before Britain's Civil Aviation Authority
against licensing the A320.
   Hennell said in a British Broadcasting Corp. TV interview: ``The
basic problem as I see it is that we don't have the technology to
ensure that the computer programs are anything like correct. The
technology of writing programs and designing computers of this
complexity just is not adequate for this sort of task.''
   But Capt. Paul Wilson, of the Guild of Air Pilots, told the BBC:
``I don't believe the computer system is responsible for this
accident.''

<HEAD>Swiss Clear Prince Charles After Avalanche Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHUR, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators dropped a criminal
inquiry and cleared Britain's Prince Charles of personal fault
after an avalanche that killed one of his close friends and injured
another, authorities said today.
   The inquiry's outcome ran counter to early speculation in
British tabloids that the heir to the throne might face charges.
   Authorities said in their statement that the prince, who was
skiing in a six-member party March 10, ``cannot be faulted'' for
his role. ``Furthermore, according to prevailing opinion, he could
not have been prosecuted in Switzerland,'' the investigators said.
   They announced they had filed no criminal charges against anyone.
   However, the Grisons canton prosecutor's office said the entire
party of six skiers, including the prince, did collectively cause
the avalanche above the Klosters resort.
   ``Other causes can be excluded,'' the office said.
   Prosecutors said that, by skiing outside official marked runs,
the group had assumed a collective risk that excluded any one
member from personal responsibility for the accident.
   Bruno Sprecher, a Klosters mountain guide who was with the royal
party on the excursion, acted in conformity with his duties, they
said.
   The 39-year-old prince and three other group members, including
Sprecher, narrowly escaped the snowslide at about 6,000 feet.
   Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, a close friend of the prince and a former
aide to his mother Queen Elizabeth, died on the spot.
   Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, another friend of the royal family,
broke both legs and underwent surgery twice.
   The prosecutor's office said the prince never claimed immunity
and cooperated fully with investigators from the beginning.
   Its statement further noted that a regional avalanche warning
was in effect above 5,280 feet on the day of the accident.
   The prince was leading the group down an extremely steep,
unmarked slope he had skied dozens of times when the snowslide
struck, the statement said.
   An avid skier, he has been a winter regular at Klosters for
years.

   Jesse Jackson said today he will bring platform
differences with Michael Dukakis to the convention floor, but
signalled strong willingness to compromise and find ``common
ground'' with the Democrats' certain presidential nominee.
   Jackson's conciliatory tone came after the Dukakis forces
prevailed at a weekend party meeting on the platform in keeping the
party's statement on issues broad on principles and short on
specifics.
   Jackson, interviewed today from Chicago on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America,'' said he is meeting with campaign aides today to
discuss what issues his more than 1,100 delegates will press for at
the convention next month in Atlanta.
   ``In some measure, our mission is to find common ground in the
committee structure,'' Jackson said. ``Where that cannot take
place, we'll take it to the floor and simply let the people air it
out in the public. That's healthy for our party. Better we be on
the floor debating than outside dividing in this context,'' he said.
   Also today, Rep. William Gray III of Pennsylvania, a Jackson
supporter who chaired the platform committee meeting, said
Jackson's forces had an impact even if they didn't carry several
key issues votes.
   ``I think there are a lot of things in this platform that are
the result of Jesse Jackson's leadership in the debate in 1988 in
the presidential primaries,'' Gray, interviewed in Washington, said
on the CBS-TV ``This Morning'' program.
   ``What we were trying to do was pull together all the elements
of the Democratic Party and it's the result of all those elements
coming together and stating what are the broad principles,'' Gray
said.
   Looking ahead to fights over such issues as higher taxes and his
call for a freeze on military spending, Jackson said any fight he
wages over the platform ``is not to make it just loud for
excitement, but to deal with a direction that will make a
difference.''
   Both the Dukakis and Jackson strategists left the Democratic
Platform Committee meeting boasting of party unity and the common
ground they reached.
   But on key areas where there was no consensus, the majority
Dukakis delegates stood their ground and resisted Jackson planks. A
Jackson budget package, combining both his call for higher taxes on
the wealthy and a Pentagon freeze, went down, 108-44, in the only
stand-up vote.
   All other amendments were handled by voice votes, adding to the
atmosphere of harmony.
   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jackson told reporters: ``There will
no doubt be some minority positions taken to the floor.'' But he
said it was too early to say which issues.
   ``I do not think that bland is beautiful,'' Jackson said later
as he campaigned in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. ``People
ought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to keep
promises, ought to make commitments. People have given us a
mandate.''
   The platform committee also rejected Jackson amendments seeking
to double the education budget, commit the United States to
no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and call for Palestinian
self-determination.
   The platform vows the Democrats will ``restore competence,
caring and incorruptibility'' to Washington and ``reverse seven
years of `voodoo economics,' `trickle down' policies and fiscal
irresponsibility.''
   It does not mention taxes or say how the Democrats will reduce
the deficit.
   Many passages bore the stamp of Jackson. The document calls for
an indexed minimum wage, terms South Africa a terrorist stat, slaps
at corporate raiders and endorses same-day and mail-in voter
registration.
   The committee also accepted less controversial Jackson
amendments, including calls for Third World debt relief and
significant increases in child care aid for low- and middle-income
families.
   ``About 95 percent of all the issues that came up between these
two campaigns have been resolved in a peaceful and in a unified
way, and I know that scares the Republicans to death,'' former
Gary, Ind., Mayor Richard Hatcher, a Jackson campaign leader, said
Saturday.
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the party chairman, said in a statement from
Washington: ``Common-sense politics has given us a short statement
of principle all Democrats can run on in November.''
   Michael Barnes, who led Dukaki's platform team, said the
placidity of the platform writing indicates ``the Democratic party
really has matured and is ready to take the reins of government.''
   ``There may be in Atlanta some further discussion of these
issues,'' said Barnes, a former Maryland congressman. ``That's
normal. But I'm confident that if there is, it will be done in the
same spirit we saw here in Denver.''
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's platform chief, said in
weighing floor fights, Jackson must decide which issues are
``icing'' and which are worth risking a divisive debate.
   Norton, a Georgetown University law professor, said the
differences between Dukakis and Jackson have not evaporated, but
``the governor and the Reverend in these proceedings moved closer
together.''
   Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., summed up the reason for vagueness in
the platform Saturday during debate the amendment pledging no first
use of nuclear weapons.
   ``We have an old saying there on the floor of the House,'' he
said. ``Nobody, no member of Congress, has ever been defeated
because of something he didn't say.''

<HEAD>Singleton House Bombing Frightens Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crude homemade bomb that exploded in
front of a home belonging to the brother of convicted rapist
Lawrence Singleton left only a slight depression in the lawn, but
it deepened neighborhood anxiety.
   ``I'm afraid some innocent people are going to be injured,''
said neighbor Lester Heitlinger.
   Walter Singleton and his wife Dianne were home but were not
injured when the bomb exploded Saturday night about 30 feet from
the front door, said Sheriff's spokeswoman Debbie Carter.
   ``We don't know for sure who it was,'' Col. Cal Henderson of the
Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said Sunday. ``Hopefully, it
was just maybe some kids.''
   Lawrence Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old
hitchhiker, chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for
dead in a ditch southeast of San Francisco in 1978. The girl
survived.
   He listed his brother's address with authorities when he moved
to Florida after being paroled, prompting a local businessman and a
radio station each to offer Singleton $5,000 if he will move.
   Walter Singleton says his brother lives ``about two hours away''
but refuses to say exactly where.
   Singleton, 60, a former merchant seaman who grew up in Tampa,
spent eight years in a California prison. He completed a year-long
probation while living in a mobile home within the gates of San
Quentin prison after attempts to place him in various California
cities met with protests.
   Walter Singleton said Sunday he feared for his wife's and
daughter's safety.
   ``I'll be up every night, probably sitting outside,'' he said.
``I hope the police are out there protecting me.''
   Bomb squad experts were looking for fingerprints and other clues
on bomb bits picked out of the lawn, Ms. Carter said.
   ``Our bomb squad has the fragments that are left, we think it
was a homemade device. We found pieces of cardboard and duct tape.
We're processing them so hopefully we'll be able to tell something
from that,''' she said.
   Said Dave Stone, who lives down the street, ``I just wish they'd
leave the people alone. The man's not there.''
   ``If we're going to get rid of him, we have to do it without
violence,'' said Heitlinger.

   Famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright's
Taliesin complex near here is deteriorating and could need as much
as $15 million in preservation work, a spokeswoman says.
   Elaine Freed, vice president for external affairs with the Frank
Lloyd Wright Foundation, said the home ``needs a great deal of
work'' and that a study will be required to determine just how much.
   James Klauser, secretary of the state Department of
Administration, said Gov. Tommy G. Thompson was interested in
helping the foundation improve Taliesin and planned to make an
announcement this afternoon.
   Taliesin, including a home and a school for architects, was
declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.
   ``Clearly Mr. Wright made a substantial contribution to
architecture in Wisconsin and throughout the country,'' said
Klauser, who also traveled to Scottsdale, Ariz., to look at
Wright's Taliesin West.
   Wright, known for designs that influenced the development of
modern architecture, died in Scottsdale in 1959 at the age of 89.
   He and his students worked both at Taliesin and at Taliesin
West. Buildings he designed include the Guggenheim Museum in New
York City and Robie House in Chicago.

   Jesse Jackson today urged sure Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to pick a ``forward-looking''
running mate as he still refused to say whether he wants the job.
   ``The fact that we're now discussing it ... even that's about
expansion and development,'' Jackson said today on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America'' program.
   Jackson, who has said he feels he has earned the right to be
considered for the national ticket based on his second-place
showing in the primaries, would discuss only his vision for the job
and not whether he should be the man to fulfill that vision.
   ``Right now we're in the process ... I feel very good about
it,'' he said from his Chicago home.
   ``I do know now we must define that job to be a meaningful
one,'' said Jackson. ``I see that job as being the possibility that
we will structure into our party hope for our youth, commitment for
our farmers and workers and someone who has rapport in the Third
World. In other words, it must be a forward-looking constitutional
position and not a retirement plan or backup plan.''
   Speaking to a convention Sunday night of Operation PUSH, the
Chicago-based civil rights group he founded, Jackson also took
apparent swipes at Republican George Bush's role as vice president
in the Reagan administration.
   ``It's not a wimp job, although there have been some wimps in
it,'' he told the hometown crowd.
   Earlier Sunday, as he campaigned in the Caribbean, Jackson
referred repeatedly to the initials that stand for vice president.
   ``V.P. doesn't mean visions of the past. It must mean vitality
for the present and vitality for the future,'' he said.
   Jackson, wrapping up a trip to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands on Sunday, suggested the Democratic platform agreed to over
the weekend does not go far enough.
   ``I do not think that bland is beautiful,'' Jackson said.
``People ought to be specific, ought to make promises, ought to
keep promises, ought to make commitments. People have given us a
mandate.''
   Jackson's calls for a defense budget freeze, increasing taxes on
the rich and Palestinian self-determination were not incorporated
into the document.
   But Jackson indicated he will press his views at the convention
next month in Atlanta.
   ``There will no doubt be some minority positions taken to the
(convention) floor,'' Jackson said, but added it was too early to
say which issues might be contested.
   Jackson also told a rally in St. Croix that he was pleased with
his ``profound victories'' in the party rules committee meeting
over the weekend in Washington.
   The committee on Saturday agreed that the number of ``super
delegates'' should be cut in half in 1992 and to mandate
proportional representation from primary and caucus votes. Super
delegates attend the convention by virtue of their status as party
or elective officials, and are not obligated to vote as their state
or district did.
   Jackson had complained that the super delegates and delegates
were unfairly distributed this year.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas today claimed they
have captured a second Afghan provincial capital in two weeks and
opened a strategic position from which they can attack the capital
of Kabul.
   The rebels' Afghan News Agency said in an unconfirmed report
that Soviet and Afghan government troops Sunday retreated from
Maidan Shahr, provincial capital of Wardak province, about 25 miles
southwest of Kabul.
   The reported victory of the rebels, following heavy fighting,
would allow them to move toward the Paghman Heights overlooking
western Kabul.
   The report came one day after Western diplomatic sources
reported that a guerrilla rocket attack on Kabul airport destroyed
eight Soviet jet fighters, the worst Soviet loss of military air
equipment in a single day since Soviet forces intervened in
December 1979.
   Pravda, Moscow's Communist Party daily, said Sunday that
guerrillas seized Maidan Shahr for one day last week before Afghan
troops recaptured it in heavy fighting.
   But a reporter for the rebel agency, which is run by the Moslem
fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami Party, said today that Soviet-Afghan
forces withdrew from the city Sunday after more heavy fighting.
   The guerrillas seized the first provincial capital, Kalat in
southeastern Zabul province, on June 18.
   The Afghan Press Agency, a pro-rebel Pakistani news service,
reported Sunday that guerrillas repulsed a Soviet attack Wednesday
near the besieged southeastern provincial capital of Kandahar.
   It said the Soviets suffered 21 dead and several injured, and
left behind the wreckage of a tank and three armored vehicles. It
said the insurgents suffered five dead and 22 wounded.
   The guerrillas have taken several Afghan and Soviet posts since
the Geneva accords April 14. Under the agreement, the Soviet Union
began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan on May 15 and would have
until Feb. 15, 1989 to complete the pullout.
   The Soviet-backed Kabul government said only Soviet troops, not
Soviet military advisers, will leave.

   After three days of wool uniforms and no
showers, thousands of men helping reenact the Battle of Gettysburg
have forsaken the life of a Civil War soldier to the 20th century.
   ``I'd like to stay longer, but you have to make a living,'' said
Griff King, a 35-year-old machine operator from Weston, W.Va. and a
member of the 2nd Virginia Regiment.
   More than 8,000 uniformed men concluded a commemoration of the
battle's 125th anniversary Sunday by staging the final charge of
the war's bloodiest confrontation.
   Organizers billed the event as the largest Civil War reenactment
ever.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the reenectment over three days,
said Paul Baebler, a spokesman for Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which
staged the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the
actual battlefield.
   After the last shots were fired, participants from North and
South stood in silence as a bugler played taps and cannons fired
one after another in a 21-gun salute to honor those who died in the
actual battle.
   Close to 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed or
wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1-3, 1863, when the
Army of the Potomac turned back the Army of Northern Virginia's
attempt to invade the North.
   A series of cannon blasts by both sides opened the fighting
Sunday. Then Confederates gave out a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder 200 yards across and several men deep across a
field and up a ridge, where Union troops waited.
   Major Gen. George E. Pickett's unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
Confederate's final offensive push at Gettysburg.
   ``If the Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil
War, then Pickett's charge was the turning point of the Battle of
Gettysburg,'' said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army
Center of Military History.
   Troops for the North and South traded volley after volley in an
engagement staged at one-third the original scale of Pickett's
Charge.
   ``It was a great battle,'' said John McQueen, a 37-year-old
marketing manager from Atlanta who fought for the 52nd Ohio
Regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him.
   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of battle.
   Five ersatz troops required hospitalization for injuries
suffered during the three days of soldiering, said Dr. Bill
Steinour, director of the emergency room at Gettysburg Hospital.
   He said there were two serious leg injuries, a skull fracture, a
man suffering chest pain and another with a kidney stone ailment.
   ``All in all, we were lucky,'' Steinour said.
   The weather, too, held for the event. It was hot and dry all
three days.
   ``Mother Nature and God were looking out for us,'' Ms. Niero
said.

<HEAD>Party Conference Focus On Politics, Not Economy, Delegate Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading economic reformer said today that this
week's Communist Party conference will focus on the party's role in
society and should not be expected to produce economic miracles.
   Otto Latsis, deputy chief editor of the monthly Kommunist and a
conference delegate, told reporters that the conference's central
aim is to unite the party behind political reform.
   Another delegate, Kommunist editor Nail B. Bikkenin, said the
goal is to develop a political system that would not allow a repeat
of the tyranny of Josef Stalin or the stagnation prevalent during
Leonid I. Brezhnev's rule.
   ``We will reconstruct our political system, which is obsolete,
obsolete,'' Bikkenin said. ``What we must have is reliable
political guarantees against a recurrence of what happened in the
past.''
   A third delegate, Pravda editor Viktor G. Afanasyev, said
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would deliver a ``big and interesting report''
when the conference opens Tuesday. Afanasyev, appearing at one of a
series of news conferences about the meeting, gave no details.
   Weeks of discussion have produced thousands of suggestions for
change, some of them as radical as having the Communist Party
general secretary elected directly by nationwide ballot.
   Proposals have been floated in the press recently, and
unfettered political discussion has occurred.
   The economy, however, has made few visible advances, and
consumer shortages of items such as sugar and cheese have worsened
in recent weeks.
   Latsis noted that in an article published today in the Communist
daily Pravda in which he called the country's retail sales system
disgraceful.
   At his news conference, Latsis said the supply system could be
improved only by providing economic stimuli and incorporating a
much greater role for demand and supply in the Soviet Union's
centraly planned economy.
   But he made clear that such matters won't be decided at the
party conference, which is expected to last at least until July 1.
   ``The central question is the question of how the party should
change its role in our society,'' Latsis said. ``In this area,
there will be decisions.''
   ``These are decisions which will change our future, but not the
next day,'' Latsis said. ``There is a lot of waiting for a
miracle.''
   Banners and propaganda posters adorning the capital as the 5,000
delegates arrived over the weekend for the first such gathering
since 1941 struck a slightly different tone.
   New lettering on many banners invoked a revolutionary style of
writing not seen since the early 1920s, when Vladimir I. Lenin had
just propelled the Bolsheviks to power.
   Latsis' remarks reflected an attempt by reformers and officials
in recent weeks to lower pubic expectations about what the
conference will produce.
   It had once been billed as a forum that would institute radical
reforms.
   Latsis said he did not yet know exactly how the conference would
be run.
   A set of proposals, known as theses, was approved by the party's
policy-making Central Committee on May 23 and has since been
debated intensely in the media and society.
   Among them is a suggestion to limit all party and state
officials to a maximum two terms in office, with a possible third
term if the electing party forum agrees.

   A train and bus collision east of Havana killed 26
people, most of them youths, and left 80 other people injured,
Cuba's state-run radio reported today.
   The crash occurred Saturday, and more than half of those injured
were in serious condition, according to a broadcast monitored here.
Most of those killed were between 12 and 19, the radio reported.
   No cause was given for the accident, which occurred along the
Barrera Highway in the city of Guanabacoa, the destination of the
bus from Megano Beach. Guanabacoa is about 10 miles east of Havana.
   All but five of the victims' remains have been identified, the
report said. It did not list any names.
   It was the second transportation tragedy in Cuba in a week.
   A collision between a bus and a tractor-trailer along Cuba's
main highway left 10 people dead and 21 injured, a Havana radio
station reported Friday. That wreck occurred when the bus driver
was blinded by lights of oncoming traffic near Jaguey Grande in the
Matanzas province.

   Aloha Airlines has defended its use of a jet
that lost part of its roof last April, saying that while the
manufacturer had suggested a structural maintenance program for
older planes, no one suggested they were unsafe to fly.
   Boeing Co. told Aloha last November that some of its jets had
significant corrosion problems and needed major structural
inspections.
   But ``At no time was it suggested by Boeing or any agency that
Aloha's four older aircraft presented a safety problem,'' Aloha
President A. Maurice Myers said Sunday.
   ``In fact, when queried by Aloha top management, Boeing
specifically declared that the four older planes were safe to
continue flying while the structural maintenance program was under
way,'' Myers said.
   Myers was responding to a published report that Boeing told
Aloha it needed a new maintenance program five months before part
of the fuselage of one of its Boeing 737s peeled off on April 28. A
cabin attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the other 94
people aboard were injured.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Seattle-based
aircraft manufacturer advised the airline: ``Aloha has a
high-frequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive
environment. These factors certainly contribute to the corrosion
and fatigue damage observed on the two airplane surveys.
   ``This as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before
and during inspections, deferring repairs and-or making temporary
instead of terminating (permanent) repairs, contributes to our
mutual concerns.''
   The airline was urged to develop a new maintenance program that
would ensure thorough and frequent inspections as well as
preventive maintenance on Aloha's aging planes, the Post said.
   Boeing spokesman Bill Clark confirmed the newspaper report. He
said his company had been communicating with Aloha Airlines as part
of an evaluation of its older planes, but he declined to comment on
the results of the evaluation or on Boeing's recommendations.
   Meanwhile, a new rule is under consideration that would for the
first time limit the number of flights planes can make in their
lifetimes, according to a report today in The New York Times. The
proposal centers on the number of flights that metal-fatigue tests
show a given type of aircraft can safely endure.
   Work on the rule, which began months ago, was speeded up after
the Aloha accident. The Boeing 737, built in 1969, had made 88,000
flights, and under the proposed rule it would have been taken out
of service before the accident.

   Security officials from seven nations
and 13 airlines will meet this week to plan anti-terrorist measures
for the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Foreign Ministry said today.
   Ministry officials said representatives will meet Tuesday and
Wednesday to share information on terrorist groups, airline safety
and other security measures.
   The United States, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, and South Korea will attend the meeting, officials said.
Hong Kong, a British colony, also plans to send delegates.
   Thirteen airlines that fly to Seoul will discuss ways to ensure
security for their aircraft during the Olympics, officials said.
The airlines were not identified.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization, the International
Air Transport Association and the International Federation of
Airline Pilot Associations will attend as observers.
   South Korea, the United States and other nations have expressed
concern that Communist North Korea will attempt to disrupt the
Summer Games or that international terrorist groups may stage
attacks.
   Delegates will consider tightening airport security checks and
improving international cooperation to prevent terrorist attacks
against the Summer Games, which run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   South Korea and the United States have expressed concern in
recent weeks over improvements in North Korea's military forces,
including the deployment of advanced SAM-5 anti-aircraft missiles
close to the border.
   The two Koreas, divided since the partition of the Korean
peninsula in 1945 at the end of World War II, are bitter foes. The
two nations fought the bloody Korean War from 1950 to 1953 after
the North invaded the south.
   The United States has some 42,000 troops in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact and plans to beef up its forces in the region
to help safeguard the Olympics.

<TEXT>
   The main owner of the beleaguered Seabrook
nuclear power plant would abandon the unused plant for the right
price, the utility's president said today.
   ``We don't have any blinders on. We are willing to consider
anything,'' said Robert Harrison of Public Service Company of New
Hampshire.
   Harrison said the utility, which filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in January, already has held a preliminary meeting
with state officials about abandoning the plant. He refused to
identify the officials.
   ``I remain convinced that the best outcome from the point of
view of the customers is to have the plant operate. But if things
happen ... we, Public Service, are not bound inexorably to the
ultimate operation of Seabrook,'' Harrison said.
   Public Service is the largest of the plant's 12 owners with 36
percent ownership. A division of Public Service built the plant on
the Atlantic Coast in the southeastern corner of New Hampshire,
about 40 miles north of Boston.
   Harrison disclosed the abandonment talks to reporters during a
discussion of the utility's legal responsibility to maximize the
value of company assets. He was asked if Public Service would
consider a deal similar to one tentatively agreed to for the
Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island in New York.
   Long Island Lighting Co. has approved an agreement with the
state of New York under which the completed but unused Shoreham
plant could be torn down. If finalized, it would be the first time
in the nation that a completed nuclear power plant was abandoned.
   In return, Long Island Lighting would continue to operate as a
privately owned company and get annual rate increases for 10 years.
   Harrison today declined to speculate about the likelihood that
Seabrook would be scrapped, and said he still believes the $5.4
billion plant will be licensed. Completed in 1986, it hasn't
received a federal operating license.
   Harrison acknowledged that it is virtually impossible for
Seabrook to be licensed before new presidential and gubernatorial
administrations take office in January.
   Likely Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, as
governor of neighboring Massachusetts, has been the key to blocking
a license for Seabrook, and would presumably continue his
opposition if he were elected president.
   Dukakis has refused to submit required emergency plans for six
Massachusetts communities near the plant, saying public safety
could not be assured in case of a major accident.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, a strong Seabrook supporter, is
not seeking re-election.
   In the past, Public Service has fought fiercely for the plant,
originally expected to cost less than $1 billion for two reactors
and scheduled to begin operating in 1979. But Harrison said the
bankruptcy filing changed things.
   ``Though we still staunchly support Seabrook and want it to
operate, we do not have the same life-or-death dependency on that
project,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebels Free Three Soldiers Held Captive For 54 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels today freed three
soldiers from 54 days of captivity after a ``people's court''
cleared them of ``crimes against the people.''
   The soldiers were released in a ceremony at an unfinished
elementary school in a remote mountain village near the town of
Sipalay, about 400 miles south of Manila.
   The ceremony was attended by about 200 villagers, as well as
human rights lawyers, Roman Catholic clergy and communist New
Poeple's Army guerrillas armed with M-16 rifles, grenade launchers
and other weapons, witnesses said.
   No government military representatives were present.
   ``We were scared this morning because we thought we will be
executed in public,'' a jubilant Pfc. Ernesto Ayson told reporters.
   Pfc. Roger Bendir, the second freed soldier, said he will quit
the military and become a farmer. Godofredo Okit, the third man,
said he plans to return to his military unit.
   One of the human rights lawyers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it was the first time rebels had freed captured
soldiers since President Corazon Aquino rose to power in 1986.
   Rebel spokesman Armando Pueblo said that during the ``trial,''
the rebels took into consideration the fact that the soldiers
surrendered immediately when guerrillas raided a military
detachment in a nearby town last May. Nine soldiers and three
rebels were killed in that incident.
   Bishop Antonio Fortich of Bacolod, a port city about 300 miles
southeast of Manila, said he hopes the release will help reduce
tension on this strife-torn island of Negros. The bishop negotiated
with rebels in behalf of the three soldiers.
   In Manila today, Mrs. Aquino said she has directed military
commanders to remove communist rebel elements from the army.
   ``I have directed the various commands in our collective task of
removing the elements of insurgency from our midst to unleash the
weapons of war,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a speech on the 90th
anniversary of the Philippine Navy. ``Force must be met by force.''
   However, she said the military must temper its war on communist
rebels with kindness, especially to insurgents who wish to
surrender.
   She added that the military must be ready to receive ``with
temperance and compassion (rebels) who wish to mend their ways and
return to the fold of the law.''
   The outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines and its
25,000-strong armed wing, the New People's Army, have been waging a
19-year-old guerrilla war to establish a Marxist state.

   The flamboyant federal prosecutor who
prosecuted a reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin and prepared an
indictment against Panama's military leader kicked off his campaign
today for the U.S. Senate.
   ``I'm broke, I don't have a dime to my name, I'm going to need
contributions,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, 44, a Republican,
said as he announced his resignation and the start of his campaign.
He has no campaign organization or party backing.
   Merkle will challenge fellow Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack in
Florida's September primary. Mack is the lone Republican in the
race for the seat being vacated by three-term Democrat Lawton
Chiles. Four Democrats also are seeking the post.
   Since he was named U.S. attorney for Florida's Middle District
in 1982, Merkle has obtained indictments against three sitting
Florida representatives, two judges, three prosecutors and dozens
of bankers, attorneys and postal workers.
   He prosecuted Carlos Lehder Rivas, a reputed member of the
Colombia-based Medellin drug cartel, believed responsible for most
of the cocaine smuggled into this country. Lehder was convicted May
19 on drug charges and faces more than a century in prison.
   Merkle, nicknamed ``Mad Dog'' for his aggressive tactics when he
was a running back at Notre Dame, also prepared one of two U.S.
drug indictments against Panama's military leader Manuel Noriega.
   He had threatened to resign several times recently when the
White House reportedly offered to drop an indictment against
Noriega in return for the dictator's departure.
   Florida Republican leaders expressed dismay at Merkle's decision.
   GOP chairwoman Jeanne Austin said candidates normally would
check with the party before launching campaigns. But she said she
has never met or spoken to Merkle, and she noted that Mack's
well-organized campaign has tied up most Republican donors.

<HEAD>Court, in Mass. Case, Loosens Search Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today loosened the
requirements for law enforcement agents to first obtain court
warrants before conducting searches on private property.
   The justices split 4-3 in ruling that evidence initially
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trial
if the same evidence is ``rediscovered'' during a second, lawful
search.
   The court's three dissenters said the ruling ``emasculates the
warrant clause'' of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which
generally requires police to get a court's permission before
conducting searches.
   In a 1984 decision, the court significantly relaxed the search
warrant requirement.
   In that case, police had entered a drug suspect's apartment
without first getting a warrant. During a brief search, they saw
some drug paraphernalia.
   Only after the initial, warrantless entry did the officers
obtain a warrant. The police did not tell the magistrate who issued
the warrant about their previous search.
   During their second search of the apartment, the police found
illegal drugs.
   The Supreme Court, although finding the first search unlawful,
said the drugs confiscated during the second search could be used
as trial evidence because the search warrant had been issued on
grounds unrelated to what police saw during the first, unlawful
search.
   In that 1984 decision, the justices said police would not be
encouraged to conduct illegal searches because ``officers who enter
illegally will recognize that whatever evidence they discover as a
direct result of the entry may be suppressed'' as evidence.
   In the case decided today, FBI agents conducted an April 6, 1983
search of a South Boston warehouse without first obtaining a search
warrant.
   The agents saw, but did not seize, 270 bales of marijuana.
   They then got a warrant, re-entered the warehouse and seized the
marijuana.
   In upholding the use of the seized marijuana as trial evidence,
the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the FBI agents did
not depend on anything seen during their first entry in obtaining
the search warrant.
   But lawyers for two men convicted in connection with the
marijuana seizure _ Michael F. Murray and James D. Carter _ argued
that the 1984 ruling's language about evidence discovered ``as a
direct result'' of an unlawful entry should control their case.
   The two men were sentenced to four years in prison and fined
$15,000 each for conspiring to possess marijuana with intent to
distribute it.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Antonin Scalia said the
marijuana does not have to be excluded as evidence if the FBI
agents would have sought a warrant to search the warehouse even if
they had not entered unlawfully the first time.
   The case now returns to a federal trial judge who will have to
make that determination.
   ``So long as a later, lawful seizure is genuinely independent of
an earlier, tainted one, ... there is no reason why (the seized
evidence should not be used at trial),'' Scalia said.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented.
   In a opinion for the three, Marshall said, ``When the very law
enforcement officers who participate in an illegal search
immediately thereafter obtain a warrant to search the same
premises, I believe the evidence discovered during the initial
illegal entry must be suppressed'' from use at trial.
   The case is Murray vs. U.S., 86-995 and 86-1016.

   Scattered thunderstorms boomed from the West to the Southeast
today after unleashing tornadoes, winds and lightning that killed
five people, burned a hole in a jetliner and knocked over a race
track tote board.
   ``We've got trees down, fences down _ you name it; we've got a
mess,'' Police Sgt. Joe Deich said in Greensboro, N.C., following
Sunday's storms.
   In Utah, a search was to resume today for a 41-year-old man who
was swept away during a sudden storm Sunday at Utah Lake in which a
10-year-old boy drowned.
   Scattered thunderstorms fell today from northeast Florida to
North Carolina. Scattered showers and thunderstorms lingered in
Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.
   Sunday's fatalities included an 8-year-old Greensboro boy who
was struck by two trees as he rode his bicycle through a storm,
police said.
   To the southwest, a 38-year-old man was fatally struck by
lightning while boating on Lake Norman, said Mecklenburg County
police Capt. J.I. Pendergraph.
   In North Branford, Conn., lightning killed a 17-year-old boy and
injured his 19-year-old girlfriend as they walked hand-in-hand
through a hayfield, said police dispatcher Phyllis Dunphy. She was
in fair condition today with first-degree burns and possible
internal injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Near Boulder, Colo., one climber was killed and another injured
when they were hit by lightning while trying to descend a 600-foot
wall in Eldorado State Park on Saturday afternoon.
   ``We knew we needed to get on down, and we were doing just
that,'' Randall Jett, 21, of Salem, Ill., said Sunday at Boulder
Community Hospital, where he was recovering from burns on several
parts of his body.
   In Shelby County, Ala., a 19-year-old man was critically injured
when he was struck by lightning, apparently while swimming in the
Coosa River, said a spokeswoman for University Hospital in
Birmingham.
   Lighting hit a Piedmont Airlines 737 as it approached Charlotte,
N.C., on Sunday night, burning a small hole in the left wing flap
and causing minor turbulence, said airline spokesman Mike Clark.
   ``The passengers were never in any peril,'' Clark said. The flap
was repaired, and the jet departed for Savannah, Ga., 75 minutes
later.
   A man was in fair condition today at a Fort Smith, Ark.,
hospital after he was injured Sunday by debris sent flying when
high winds demolished a tote board, used to flash odds on different
horses to bettors, at Blue Ribbon Downs in Sallisaw, Okla.
   The winds knocked part of a wall and roof into the grandstands
and destroyed shortly before the start of the 11th race, forcing
cancellation of the 11th and 12th races, said Kerry Eason, the
track's publicity director.
   Tornadoes were reported Sunday in Colorado, Kansas, Texas,
Alabama, North Carolina, and gusts of 90 mph were clocked in Tall
Timbers, Md. Trees and power lines were downed in Oklahoma and from
Alabama to Virginia, the National Weather Service said.
   In Alabama, an estimated 12,000 people from Birmingham in the
north-central part of the state to Dothan in the southeast lost
power, Alabama Power Co. officials said. Service was restored by
today.
   The wind blew down a radio tower in Aiken, Ga., destroyed two
mobile homes in Andalusia, Ala.; damaged 19 mobile homes in
Rockingham County, N.C.; toppled small buildings in Honea Path,
S.C.; and blew the roof off an apartment complex in Stillwater,
Okla.
   Wind gusting to 75 mph damaged at least 25 homes in
Murfreesboro, Tenn., said police officer Jeff Stiles.
   ``It blew the sides off buildings, blew some roofs off and blew
the glass out of several store fronts,'' said Stiles.
   In Dothan, two sections of roof at the Dothan-Houston County
Airport were blown off. A section of roof that landed in the
airport parking lot, along with swirling rocks and gravel, damaged
an estimated 25 cars, said Houston County emergency management
coordinator Bobby Clemmons.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Exemption from State Sales Taxes of Indian Bingo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that grants an exemption from state sales taxes to high-stakes
bingo games run by Indian tribes.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Oklahoma
officials seeking to impose the tax on revenue from a bingo game in
Tulsa run by the Muscogee Creek Nation.
   The justices in February 1987 ruled in a California case that
state and local governments may not regulate high-stakes bingo
games and other gambling operations on Indian reservations.
   And last September, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that Oklahoma could not force the Muscogee Creek Nation to collect
and remit the state's 2.5 percent sales tax on the tribe's bingo
operations.
   The appeals court said the state's interest in collecting the
tax is minimal in this case.
   ``Patrons do not travel onto Creek lands to play bingo in order
to avoid sales taxes,'' the appeals court said. ``Creek Nation
bingo does not undermine the state economy or tax base. The state
is not losing tax revenues it would otherwise obtain from sales
made outside of tribal boundaries.''
   The appeals court also based its ruling in part on the Supreme
Court's ruling in the California case, which said state and local
governments have no say over Indian-run gambling unless Congress
gives them permission.
   The Muscogee Creek bingo game is conducted in Tulsa on a
100-acre area known as the Mackey site along the Arkansas River.
   The 10th Circuit court said the land is Indian territory in the
same way any reservation belongs to native Americans.
   The appeals court also said the fact that the bingo game is
managed by a non-tribal entity _ Indian Country, USA Inc. _ hired
by the tribe does not alter the exempt status of the gambling
operation.
   Forcing the tribe to collect and remit the sales tax would place
a heavy burden on the Indians even if the tax did not affect
revenue for the Creeks, the appeals court said.
   It added that the tribe would be subject to fines and liens on
its property if it were held responsible for collecting the tax and
then failed to do so.
   Asked for its views, the Reagan administration urged the court
to reject Oklahoma's appeal.
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Muscogee Creek Nation,
87-1068.

<HEAD>Heart Association Approves Plan To Endorse Some Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food products bearing a ``heart-healthy'' stamp
of approval from the American Heart Association will begin
appearing on store shelves within a year, the group says.
   A system to identify and endorse processed and packaged foods
that are low in salt, cholesterol and fat was approved by the
association Sunday.
   The first group of foods to be examined by an independent
testing laboratory will be margarines, cooking oils and salad
dressings. The association does not plan to endorse meats, fruits
and other non-processed food items.
   ``The idea is to make it easy for consumers to rapidly identify
a product that is appropriate for them,'' said Dr. Louis Rakita,
vice chairman of a committee that studied the food product-approval
program for two years.
   Committee members said dietary control is one of the most
effective ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Since
1961, the Heart Association has been recommending a diet low in
fat, salt and cholesterol as a way to help reduce heart disease.
   ``Many Americans have adopted healthier eating habits, and
dietary improvements recommended by the AHA clearly have played a
part in the welcome decline in heart attack and stroke death rates
that we have seen in the last two decades,'' said Dr. W.W. Aston of
Dallas, committee chairman.
   Heart and blood vessel diseases are the nation's leading
killers, and took nearly 1 million lives in the United States in
1985, the most recent year for which statistics are complete. The
Heart Association said nearly 65 million Americans have one or more
forms of the diseases.
   Approval of the program came at the annual meeting of the
association's policy-making delegate assembly.
   Aston said two independent nationwide surveys of consumers and
health specialists showed that they wanted more specific
information about fat and cholesterol levels.
   The program will include creation of a consumer health
information program. It will establish a toll-free national
nutritional telephone hot line staffed by registered dietitians who
will give information about nutrition and risk factors for heart
disease to the public and health professionals.
   The program also will include media campaigns and a brochure
listing products that receive the association's stamp of approval.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Veterans' Disability Benefits Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether military veterans' disability benefits indirectly may be
subjected to a state's community property law when they divorce.
   The court said it will review a ruling that California's
required splitting of benefits with ex-spouses does not violate
federal law.
   Gerald and Gaye Mansell were divorced in 1979 after 25 years of
marriage. Part of the divorce settlement, not at issue in the case,
entitled each to one-half of Mansell's Air Force retirement pay.
   Mansell receives about $1,200 a month in retirement benefits,
but has waived his entitlement to about $480 a month in additional
retirement benefits so he can receive Veterans Administration
disability benefits instead.
   Because VA disability benefits, unlike military retirement pay,
are exempt from taxes, such waivers of retirement pay are common.
   California courts also ordered that Gaye Mansell receive half of
the $480-per-month entitlement to retirement pay her ex-husband is
passing up.
   Mansell sought to modify the settlement in 1983, arguing that
the state's community property law was pre-empted by federal law
when it comes to dividing the disability benefits.
   ``Congress clearly intended the Veterans' Administration
disability benefits to remain the separate property of the disabled
veteran,'' Mansell argued in the appeal acted on today.
   His argument was rejected by a state trial judge and a state
appeals court. The California Supreme Court refused to hear his
appeal last April 29.
   At issue is a federal law passed by Congress in the wake of a
1981 Supreme Court decision that barred state courts from dividing
military retirement pay. It allowed retirement pay to be subjected
to alimony awards.
   Mansell contended that the 1981 law did not authorize such state
court awards based on disability benefits.
   Asked for its views, the Reagan administration urged the court
to review the controversy.
   Justice Department lawyers contended that California courts
cannot order Mansell to pay alimony based on his VA disability
benefits. But they said he could be ordered to pay half of his
retirement pay entitlement _ which includes the money he is waiving
each month _ from other available income.
   For example, Mansell could be forced to pay in alimony some $840
instead of $600 from the $1,200 in retirement pay he receives each
month, the government lawyers said.
   The case is Mansell vs. Forbes, 87-201.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, wrapping up a
four-day island vacation today, will travel to Washington on
Wednesday to discuss with Senate Democrats his selection of a vice
presidential candidate and other issues.
   Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan said the Massachusetts
governor had decided to delay by one day a scheduled campaign trip
through the Midwest in order to spend Wednesday in private meetings
on Capitol Hill.
   The meetings were announced as the Dukakis campaign signaled its
intention to unveil the running mate choice before the Democratic
National Convention begins on July 18.
   A report in today's Boston Herald quoted a campaign source as
saying the decision may be announced by July 4.
   Gearan said no decision had been made on when a selection would
be made or announced.
   ``I think it's much too early in the process to make any
determination like that,'' Gearan said.
   He said Dukakis would meet privately with 20 to 30 or perhaps
more Senate Democrats, individually or in groups, and would arrange
a meeting with House members at a later time. He said the vice
presidency would be among the topics.
   Dukakis was winding down a four-day holiday in Nantucket and
finding out that likely presidential nominees don't really get away
_ even on a getaway.
   Dukakis was accompanied on the trip by only a few aides but a
large group of Secret Service bodyguards and a large contingent of
reporters, photographers and television crews.
   Speaking with the journalists Friday in the yard of his borrowed
vacation home, Dukakis noted the presence of the hefty entourage.
   ``These days, strolling around isn't what it used to be,'' he
said a bit wistfully.
   The Massachusetts governor and his wife were leaving this
Nantucket Island resort off Cape Cod tonight.
   The weather was too cool for the Dukakises to visit the beach
during their break from the presidential campaign. Rain and
thunderstorms moved inSunday and kept them inside the house, where
press secretary Mark Gearan said Dukakis ate seafood, read and
relaxed.
   ``He's just been relaxing this afternoon,'' Gearan said Sunday
at a briefing for journalists accompanying the candidate to the
island.
   Gearan said Dukakis steered clear of major work on his next big
decision, selecting a running mate.
   He said the Massachusetts governor did not even talk by
telephone with aides in Denver, where the Dukakis campaign
succeeded in winning a proposed platform document free of calls for
higher taxes and a defense budget freeze sought by rival Jesse
Jackson.
   While the party platform action was taken amid signals of party
unity, and displayed Dukakis' strength in controlling the platform
issue, Gearan made no claim that the Democratic National Convention
in Atlanta next month would be free of floor battles over the
platform.
   ``We have a good working relationship with Jackson's campaign,
and things are going well,'' Gearan said.
   But he added, ``I think he's said all along there could very
well be some floor fights at the convention.''
   Gearan responded to comments by Vice President George Bush, the
certain Republican nominee, who has criticized Massachusetts'
prison furlough program and stepped up his charges last week by
saying drug dealers were being released on weekend passes.
   Gearan said a 1983 state law signed by Dukakis imposed mandatory
sentences for drug dealers that prohibits furlough releases.
   Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, who is wearing a neck brace while
she recovers from spinal surgery, took walks around the area before
the rain came and they slipped into the village of Nantucket for
dinner at a fashionable restaurant Saturday night.
   Dukakis and his wife are staying at the Colonial-style home of
longtime friends Bernard and Grace Grossman, situated on a
well-manicured hillside overlooking the water.
   They took most of their meals at their hosts' table, where Mrs.
Grossman served shrimp and prepared homemade apple pie and peach
muffins.
   The Dukakis' daughter Kara joined them with a college friend for
breakfast Sunday morning. Mrs. Dukakis went into town shopping with
her daughter and Grace Grossman while Dukakis read the Sunday
newspapers.
   Dukakis, known for being budget-conscious in his personal
habits, said on arriving he had no plans for shopping, ``Not a bit
of it.'' Mrs. Dukakis, who likes to shop while on campaign trips,
leaned over and said, ``We haven't discussed it.''
   Dukakis was returning to Boston on a commercial commuter flight
Monday night and planned to be back in his Statehouse offices
Tuesday. Mrs. Dukakis was traveling to nearby Martha's Vineyard,
another island off Cape Cod, for several days of relaxing, while
Dukakis plans a three-day campaign trip through six Midwestern
states.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether prison officials sometimes must explain why they bar an
inmate from having visitors.
   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling
that a Kentucky prison's visitation program created a ``liberty
interest'' for inmates that cannot be infringed upon without due
process.
   The appeals court ruling did not say what kind of due process _
perhaps a written explanation of denied visitation rights or some
type of hearing _ is required. But Kentucky officials appealed
anyway.
   More than half the states supported Kentucky's appeal in a
``friend-of-the-court'' brief, urging the high court to issue a
decision setting precedent nationally.
   They said the Kentucky prison's visitation policy is similar to
those at prisons in many states.
   ``More significantly, there are a number of other policies at
the correctional institutions ... concerning the daily operation of
prisons ranging from inmate job assignments to telephone privileges
which in all likelihood are also affected,'' the states' brief
contended.
   The Kentucky controversy stems from a lawsuit inmates of the
Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange filed over conditions there.
   The suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree, in which the state
agreed, among other things, to continue an ``open visitation
policy.''
   State officials subsequently adopted guidelines and procedures
for handling prison visits.
   In 1985, inmate Kenneth Bolitt's mother was denied the right to
visit him temporarily because she had brought to the prison with
her a man previously barred for smuggling contraband.
   Inmate Kevin Black's mother and girlfriend were barred from the
prison temporarily because Black had been convicted of possessing
contraband immediately after one of their visits.
   A ``class action'' lawsuit filed in behalf of all the prison's
inmates contended that the suspension of visitors' privileges
without any due-process hearing was unlawful.
   A federal trial judge ruled for the inmates, and the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last Nov. 19.
   ``Given the regulatory and mandatory language (in the visitation
policy guidelines), a liberty interest was created under the
circumstances here,'' the appeals court said.
   It sent the case back to a trial judge to determine ``the
particular procedural process due the (inmates) when visitation is
denied.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, state officials said the
appeals court ruling _ potentially binding law in Kentucky, Ohio,
Michigan and Tennessee _ could ``inhibit substantially corrections
officials from drafting policies that may confer a benefit on an
inmate.''
   Kentucky's appeal said the 6th Circuit court's ruling could
affect such inmate benefits as honor housing, furloughs, work and
study programs, outside trips, recreation, escorted leaves and
inmate clubs.
   ``Finding that such policies create a constitutionally protected
interest is untenable,'' the appeal contended.
   The case is Kentucky vs. Thompson, 87-1815.

   Dredging reopened shallow parts of the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers to barges today, but weekend rain over parts of the parched
South did little to end the drought there and a U.S. senator
threatened to hit crop speculators ``with hobnailed boots.''
   ``The bottom line is that the drought is not alleviated really
in the worst areas,'' the Midwest and the Tennessee Valley,
National Weather Service meteorologist Pete Reynolds said today
from Kansas City, Mo.
   The best chance for rain in those areas, suffering the nation's
worst drought since the Dust Bowl, is not until Friday, ``so we're
still looking for a pretty dry week,'' Reynolds said.
   On Sunday, thunderstorms boomed through much of the dry
Southeast, but temperatures reached 105 degrees in some places.
Temperatures in the northern Plains sizzled at up to 108 degrees
Sunday. Temperature records fell or were tied in a dozen cities.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also fell in the lower
Mississippi Valley and the southern Plains.
   Heavier rainfall in six hours ending Sunday evening included 3}
inches in Dothan, Ala., 1{ inches in Oklahoma City and more than an
inch in Fort Campbell, Ky.
   Also Sunday, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
predicted that food prices would rise 2 percent to 4 percent next
year because of the drought.
   The Vermont Democrat said on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' his
committee would monitor market activity in farm products.
   ``If my committee finds that anybody is speculating on this,
taken ... what's happening to these farmers ... whether it's
grocery stores, producers or exporters or anybody else, we're going
to come own on them with hobnailed boots,'' he said.
   Leahy said that although such speculation was not illegal, those
engaging in it would run the risk of being called before his
committee to explain how they ``bought profits based on the misery
of farmers.''
   The drought could cost cattle producers in Arkansas alone up to
$100 million, off last year's total of $400 million, because sales
of cattle in the face of dwindling grass are driving prices down,
Howard Young, executive vice president of the Arkansas Cattleman's
Association, said today.
   Record low water has slowed commercial traffic and repeatedly
caused huge barge backups on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
   At St. Louis, the Mississippi was reopened Sunday afternoon,
releasing a traffic jam estimated at 1,000 barges. Coast Guard
spokesman Gary Cooper said today that the backlog had cleared ``and
traffic is moving well as of this moment.''
   Down river at Memphis, Tenn., traffic moved slowly but steadily
early today, said Chief Warrant Officer Jackie Tucker. More than
1,100 barges had backed up until Friday, when the Army Corps of
Engineers finished cutting a channel through a sand buildup.
   ``There are problems on the river, but they are manageable.
We'll keep it open,'' said Robert Page, assistant secretary of the
Army for civil works.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has identified 30 to 35 possible
trouble spots on the lower Mississippi, most within 100 miles of
Memphis, but dredges will keep them open most of the time, said
Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Sands, who heads the Mississippi River
Commission.
   Sands and Page toured the lower Mississippi on Sunday with Rear
Adm. William Leahy of the Coast Guard.
   On the Ohio River, a section near Mound City, Ill., remained
open Sunday after being closed much of Saturday, but the flow of
water toward the city stopped when a dam a few miles up river was
closed.
   ``It's going to get shallower,'' warned Coast Guard Lt. Ron
Blake.
   The Coast Guard would decide whether to close the river
indefinitely because of shallow water, but without relief the river
may soon get too low to pass, Blake said.
   On the Missouri River, the Corps of Engineers decided last
weekend to end the commercial navigation season in mid-November,
instead of the usual Dec. 1, to conserve dwindling water supplies.
   The drought also threatens to snuff traditional Fourth of July
fireworks because of the fire danger, and Michigan Gov. James
Blanchard has imposed a statewide ban on open burning.
   On the dry northern Plains, a week-old forest fire on the
Montana-South Dakota border burned an estimated 50,000 acres by
today after 45 mph wind helped it break through an army of
firefighters Sunday and race several miles northward. It had been
70 percent contained before the outbreak.
   ``We essentially lost all firefighting capabilities,''
information officer Jack kendley said Sunday night in Billings,
Mont.
   Elsewhere, four weekend wildfires charred more than 700 acres of
drought-dry grassland in southern California, including one blaze
that injured 10 and damaged four homes. Rain and lower temperatures
helped firefighters control a 137-acre fire in the Boise National
Forest.

   A Cuban official said the visit of President
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua will strengthen the close relations the
two nations have maintained for nearly a decade.
   Ortega was to arrive today for talks with President Fidel Castro.
   During the visit, Ortega will be awarded Cuba's highest medal,
the order of Jose Marti, the 19th century Cuban revolutionary.
   ``This visit is to further strengthen our relations,'' said
Cuban Foreign Ministry press director Omar Mendoza. ``We have
always shown our solidarity in the face of the aggression, the
suffering imposed by the United States and its dirty war.''
   Ortega's visit to Cuba coincides with a trip this week by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz to U.S. allies in Central
America, including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras.
   Ortega's trip also comes as the Reagan adminisration is
considering renewing its congressional request for aid to the
right-wing rebels known as Contras, who have been fighting since
1981 to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government.
   At home, Ortega faces deep social, economic and political
problems. Two weeks ago he announced measures to steer the economy
away from socialist policies toward capitalism. The Cuban
invitation could serve as a nod of approval by Castro.
   Cuba and Nicaragua have maintained close relations since the
Sandinista government came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war
that ousted dicatator Anastasio Somoza. Diplomatic relations,
broken by Somoza in 1960, were reinstated days after the new
government was installed in Managua.
   Castro traveled to Managua in July 1980 to celebrate the first
Sandinista anniversary and visited again in January 1985 to attend
Ortega's inauguration as president.
   Castro, whose Communist government will mark its 30th
anniversary in January, has sent large numbers of Cuban teachers,
doctors and military advisers to work in Nicaragua.
   The United States broke diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba
shortly after Castro came to power in 1959.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to referee
environmental disputes over the planned development of a ski resort
in Washington's Methow Valley and an unfinished dam on Elk Creek in
southern Oregon.
   The justices said they will decide whether additional
environmental impact studies are required before federal agencies
may give final approval to both projects.
   Justice Department lawyers had appealed both lower court rulings.
   Sandy Butte, a 6,000-foot mountain in the Okanogan National
Forest overlooks the Methow Valley, a sparsely populated area on
the eastern side of the North Cascade Mountains in Washington.
   The valley is a winter home for Washington's largest migratory
deer herd.
   Methow Recreation Inc. in 1978 asked for permission to develop
and operate a ski resort, to be called Early Winters, on Sandy
Butte and a large parcel of land it had bought adjoining the
mountain.
   The project is expected to spawn extensive commercial and
residential development in the Methow Valley.
   The U.S. Forest Service in 1982 published a draft environmental
impact statement, and a final statement in 1984.
   In late 1985, the Methow Valley Citizens Council sued in federal
court. The suit contended, among other things, that the Forest
Service had violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
in approving the Early Winters project.
   A federal trial judge dismissed the suit, but the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it.
   The appeals court ruled that the Forest Service must come up
with detailed and effective ``mitigation measures'' to protect the
valley's air quality, the deer herd and other environmental aspects.
   The appeals court said the Forest Service's impact statement
offered ``no assurance whatsoever that the vague mitigation
objectives it features ... would ever in fact be achieved or even
that effective measures would ever be designed, let alone
implemented, if the Early Winters development were to proceed.''
   The 9th Circuit court concluded that the impact statement's
``discussion of mitigation measures is inadequate as a matter of
law.''
   The Oregon controversy dates back to 1962, when Congress
authorized construction of the Rogue River Basin Project a flood
control program in the southern part of the state.
   Elk Creek Dam was one of three dams included in the project, and
is the only one not completed and operating.
   Elk Creek is a tributary of the Rogue River, one of eight rivers
in the nation designated as ``wild and scenic'' by a 1968 law. The
Rogue is known for its white-water rafting and fly-fishing.
   The Corps of Engineers filed a series of environmental impact
statements on the Elk Creek project from 1971 through 1980 before
the Oregon Natural Resources Council and other environmental groups
sued.
   The lawsuit contended that the Corps of Engineers failed to
comply with the Natural Environmental Policy Act of 1969 by
submitting an incomplete final environmental impact statement.
   The 9th Circuit court agreed, stating, ``An EIS must include a
discussion of measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of
the proposed action.''
   ``Because the wildlife mitigation plan here merely lists
measures to be used and includes neither an analysis nor an
explanation of effectiveness, it is inadequate to satisfy the
NEPA,'' the appeals court added.
   The cases are Robertson vs. Methow Valley Citizens Council,
87-1703, and Marsh vs. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 87-1704.

   The Supreme Court today gave defense
contractors important protection against lawsuits by people who
accuse them of making defective equipment that causes death or
injury.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, refused to reinstate a $725,000
award to the family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a
1983 crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.
   The court said companies may not be sued when they make military
equipment using a design approved by the Pentagon, as long as the
contractors did not conceal any potential hazards from the
government.
   The Supreme Court previously has ruled that members of the armed
services may not sue the government directly over injuries suffered
in connection with the military service.
   Today's ruling marked the first time the high court has extended
similar protection to military contractors.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said state laws
authorizing personal injury suits generally are pre-empted by the
federal government's need to make unfettered military decisions.
   ``We are of the view that state law which holds government
contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in
some circumstances present a significant conflict with federal
policy and must be displaced,'' he said.
   Scalia said suits against contractors are barred when the
Pentagon approves reasonably precise specifications, the equipment
conforms to those specifications and the supplier warns the
government about potential dangers the equipment poses.
   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice William J. Brennan said,
``The court's newly discovered government contractor defense is
breathtakingly sweeping.''
   He said, ``This court lacks both authority and expertise to
fashion'' such broad protection for contractors ``whether to
protect the Treasury of the United States or the coffers of
industry.''
   The power to devise rules on when contractors may be sued should
be left to Congress ``where our Constitution places it,'' Brennan
said.
   The ruling comes at a time when Pentagon contracting is under
extraordinary scrutiny with an investigation underway into alleged
fraud and bribery in military procurement. Today's decision is not
connected to that investigation.
   Today's ruling also could have a bearing on the U.S. shuttle
disaster. Some lawyers have argued that granting military
contractors broad protection from lawsuits would shield Morton
Thiokol, maker of the shuttle.
   Today's case stemmed from a federal jury award of $725,000 to
the family of David Boyle, who drowned April 27, 1983, in the crash
of a CH-53 helicopter.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May 1986 threw out the
award against the helicopter manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft, and
its parent company, United Technologies Corp.
   The appeals court said Sikorsky, as a government military
contractor, was shielded from damages based on alleged design
defects in the helicopter. The appeals court also said there was
insufficient evidence to prove that Sikorsky improperly repaired a
steering control system in the helicopter.
   The company was accused of negligence in the design of the
helicopter's escape hatch.
   Boyle and the three other crew members survived the crash
impact. The three others escaped through emergency hatches, but
Boyle was unable to force his hatch to open against the pressure of
the water.
   His family also charged that Sikorsky defectively repaired the
pilot valve of the helicopter's servo, which acts as a form of
power steering to help the pilot fly the helicopter.
   The 4th Circuit court said a military contractor generally is
free from liability for design defects if it can show its product
conformed to Pentagon specifications and if it warned the military
about known dangers in the use of the equipment.
   The appeals court noted that Sikorsky built the helicopter with
the Navy reviewing its design, including a mock-up of the cockpit
with all instruments, controls and escape hatches in place.
   The appeals court also said allegations that Sikorsky improperly
overhauled the steering mechanism were conjectural.
   The Supreme Court today sent the case back to the 4th Circuit
court, but only to restudy a fairly narrow issue.
   The justices said the judgment for the Boyles must be thrown out
if the 4th Circuit court decides that the jury properly applied the
military contractor defense.
   The Supreme Court said the suit could be reinstated if the
appeals court improperly acted as a trial court and decided itself
that the facts of the case established the military contractor
defense.
   But in key respects, today's ruling appears to give military
contractors legal protection that goes beyond the ban on suits by
members of the armed forces for injuries suffered in connection
with military duty.
   The court extended the protection for contractors to cases in
which civilians are injured.
   Joining Scalia were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy. The dissenters, besides Brennan, were Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is Boyle vs. United Technologies Corp., 86-492.

<HEAD>A Revival of `The Night of the Iguana' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs at end with other critics</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The spooks'' who torment the major characters
in Tennessee Williams' ``The Night of the Iguana'' never seem very
threatening in the mild revival which arrived Sunday at the Circle
in the Square Theater.
   The drama, first performed in New York in 1961, simmers in
obvious symbolism, but this production, hampered by miscasting and
perfunctory staging, doesn't even capitalize on the play's more
florid poetry. It dilutes Williams' story, eliminating much of the
passion and leaving only the bare bones of the story.
   The time is 1940. The setting is a dilapidated tourist hotel on
the western coast of Mexico. And the iguana of the title is a
trapped creature, tied up and kept under the hotel porch where it
is being fattened up as a future meal.
   The main characters also are trapped, bound by their own fears
and failures. Chief among these neurotic captives is the Rev. T.
Lawrence Shannon, a defrocked minister reduced to leading Bible
Belt ladies on third-rate bus tours of the Mexican countryside.
   Shannon seeks refuge from the harridans on his tour in the hotel
which is run by Maxine, a lusty and cynical widow. Among the other
residents are ``the world's oldest living poet,'' struggling to
write a final poem, and the poet's unmarried granddaughter who
despite her spiritual quality displays a practicality that enables
her to survive.
   The ex-minister must battle his desire for liquor and
particularly young girls, a failing that has gotten him into
trouble once again when the curtain rises. As Shannon explains,
``When you live on the fantastic level as I have lately but have
got to operate on the realistic level, that's when you're spooked,
that's the spook.''
   Nicolas Surovy, who plays the dissolute Shannon, doesn't capture
the man's pain and weariness at having to perpetually struggle.
Besides looking too young _ and healthy _ for the role, Surovy
never manages to suggest that here is a man ready for death,
willing even to swim out to sea and drown if he could lose his
problems.
   Equally unconvincing is Jane Alexander in the role originated on
Broadway by Bette Davis and in the movie version by Ava Gardner.
Miss Alexander seems uncomfortable as the blowsy Maxine, maybe
wishing she were playing Hannah, the ethereal spinster. Maria
Tucci, in the revival's best performance, manages to portrayt
Hannah's steely resolve as well as her desperation at not knowing
what will happen after her grandfather dies.
   William LeMassena doesn't suggest the mental and physical
deterioration of the old poet, but a comic Pamela Payton-Wright
exudes the proper shrillness as the most vocal of the irate
tourists on Shannon's tour.
   The lush tropical setting by Zack Brown spills nicely across the
theater's elongated stage, filled with rocks, leafy plants and
exotic trees. But director Theodore Mann doesn't utilize the set.
At times, the characters stand around awkwardly, looking like they
are staring into a black void, rather than conversing with another
person on stage.
   The production ends up being a literal, static remounting of the
play, without the fire that should ignite the story. This ``Night
of the Iguana'' ends up as a long snooze rather than a compelling
drama of coping with personal demons that never will go away.
   What other critics said:
   In The New York Times, Mel Gussow wrote, ``Unsteadily guided by
Mr. Mann, the production seems, alternately, languorous and
heavyhanded. ... The Costa Verde is in place, with all its out of
season seediness, ready to welcome its disparate, lonely
characters, but, with the definite exception of Ms. Tucci, the
theatrical hotel is not amply inhabited.''
   Howard Kissel, in the Daily News, said, ``Watching Tennessee
Williams' `Night of the Iguana,' I kept wondering if Ted Mann, who
directed it and who runs Circle in the Square, which recently
presented a lame `Streetcar,' wants to do to Williams what Joe Papp
is doing to Shakespeare: present his plays so flatly you'd never
know the author was a poet.''
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post wrote, ``... in the final
count it lacks something in urgency and anxiety _ partly because of
the conventionally distraught but essentially bland portrayal given
by Nicolas Surovy as Shannon ... This is still a play in search of
its ultimate definition _ a definition that cannot come, oddly
enough, until a great and perhaps bizarre actor ... shows us how
the play can really work.''

<HEAD>Court Says Federal Judges Have Authority to Award Lawyers Fees in
California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today said federal judges
have substantial authority to award fees to lawyers who win suits
against the government.
   The justices, voting 6-2, said a California anti-poverty law
firm is entitled to recover legal fees for sucessfully challenging
the withholding of federal housing subsidies.
   But the court said $322,700 in fees awarded to the firm is
excessive and ordered further hearings to determine a lower amount.
   The Reagan administration had argued that the fee was both
excessive and not justified at all.
   The Western Center on Law and Poverty in Los Angeles represented
tenants of government-subsidized housing seeking to force the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to pay increased costs
for utilities and local taxes.
   The tenants challenged a decision by HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce
not to use money from a rental reserve fund to pay the costs.
   The case was settled when the government agreed to deposit $60
million into a special escrow fund to be distributed to needy
tenants and to owners of subsidized housing.
   While the settlement was being administered, Congress in 1980
passed the Equal Access to Justice Act to compensate attorneys who
win lawsuits against the government.
   The law generally imposes a $75-per-hour ceiling for lawyers'
fees but permits higher hourly pay in some circumstances.
   The law authorizes judges to award legal fees to the winning
side in suits against the government unless the judge finds the
government's position ``was substantially justified or that special
circumstances make an award unjust.''
   A federal judge in the California case applied an hourly rate
ranging from $80 to $120, totaling $322,700. The judge said the
litigation was complex, protracted and required attorneys with
special skills and qualifications.
   The Reagan administration said the tenants surrendered their
right to the lawyers' fees when they agreed to the settlement. It
also argued that the $75 per hour ceiling should be used if any
legal fees are awarded.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court today, upheld the
authority of the trial judge to decide that Pierce's position was
not ``substantially justified'' as defined in the Equal Access to
Justice Act.
   But Scalia said the $75-an-hour cap must apply. Granting the
lawyers higher fees must be based on more than the factors cited by
the judge in the case, Scalia said.
   Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor, in a dissenting
opinion, voted to strike down the award of legal fees entirely.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not take part in the ruling.
   The case is Pierce vs. Underwood, 86-1512.

   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway
today accused rich nations of playing lethal games with the Earth's
life-support system and made a proposal to combat the greenhouse
effect and protect the atmosphere.
   In a keynote address to the Canadian-sponsored World Conference
on the Changing Atmosphere, Dr. Brundtland, a noted
environmentalist, told more than 300 scientists and politicians
from 40 countries:
   ``The impact of climatic change may be greater and more drastic
than any other challenges that mankind has faced with the exception
of the threat of nuclear war.''
   She called for a ``new global ethic'' in which protection
against air and water pollution, ozone depletion and acid rain is a
prerequisite for economic development.
   ``We have been playing lethal games with vital life-support
systems,'' said Brundtland.
   Her five-point plan included development of renewable energy
sources in the next century; the transfer of modern, low-polluting
technologies to Third World countries; more research on climatic
change, and consideration of a global convention on protecting the
atmosphere.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney opened the four-day
conference by offering to host a U.N.-run World Conference on
Sustainable Development in 1992.
   By that time, he urged participants, an ``international law of
the atmosphere'' should be negotiated to limit all types of air
pollution.
   Those attending include the heads of U.N. environmental
agencies; cabinet ministers from Indonesia, the Netherlands and
Senegal; scientists from Harvard University and the Soviet Academy
of Sciences, and U.S. Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., and U.S. Rep.
George E. Brown, Jr., D-Calif.
   Scientists will discuss ozone depletion, acid rain, water
management and food prospects, but much interest centers on the
recent warming of the earth's surface due to the greenhouse effect,
in which gases humans have introduced into the atmosphere prevent
heat from escaping.
   Although experts are not yet ready to ascribe the 1988 drought
to the greenhouse effect, the earth has been warmer in the first
five months of this year than in any comparable period since
measurements began 130 years ago, a NASA climatologist, James
Hansen, told a Congressional hearing in Washington last week.
   Five of the warmest years on record have occurred in the 1980s
and scientists at Environment Canada predict global temperatures
could rise up to 8 degrees by the year 2050, partially melting the
polar ice caps and raising sea levels three feet.
   ``In the last 1,000 years, the climate fluctuated about a half
of a degree. Now we can expect it to go up at 10 times that rate, a
phenomenal change unprecedented in human history,'' Henry
Hengeveld, a climate expert for Environment Canada, told a news
conference.
   The problem is manmade. The burning of oil, gas, wood and coal
in factories, homes and cars sends the greenhouse gases of carbon
dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons into
the atmosphere.
   For much of the world, there are no alternatives to fossil fuel.
In developed countries, public opinion has turned against the
cleaner option of nuclear power because of the risk of catastrophic
accidents.
   Another major atmospheric problem is the gradual destruction of
the thin ozone layer, which protects the earth from the sun's
harmful ultraviolet rays. Chlorofluorocarbons used in spray cans,
insulation, refrigerators and industrial cleaning tear holes in the
ozone, and the result has been a marked increase in skin cancer.
   Twenty-four nations signed the Montreal Protocol on ozone last
year, pledging to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 50
percent by 1999.
   McDonalds restaurants promised to use something else to insulate
their take-away packaging and a new type of refrigerator with
helium as a coolant is under development. But global protection
remains a distant goal.
   Canada's first atmospheric priority is acid rain. The government
blames power plant emissions from the U.S. Midwest for at least
half the acid rain falling in eastern Canada, which has led to the
destruction of fish life in 14,000 lakes and extensive forest
damage.

   Northwest Airlines has on order up to 100
Airbus A320 jetliners like the one that crashed during a
demonstration flight in France, a company official said.
   The twin-engine Air France aircraft crashed in a forest at the
end of an airfield in eastern France near the Swiss border. Three
passengers were killed and 50 others were injured.
   ``I doubt (the crash) would have an impact on our decision to
purchase from Airbus,'' Alan Muncaster, a spokesman for Northwest,
said Sunday. ``But obviously we would want to check into the cause
of the crash.''
   Northwest, based in this St. Paul suburb, and Airbus announced
in October 1986 that Northwest would buy up to 100 Airbus A320s
from its manufacturer, Airbus Industrie, in a deal that would be
worth $3.2 billion.
   Pan American World Airways has ordered 16 A230s, with an option
to buy 34 more. In addition, two U.S. leasing companies have
ordered the A320. GATX Air has ordered 10 and International Lease
Finance Corp. has three on order.
   A spokesman for Airbus Industrie said there were indications
that human error caused Sunday's crash, but the president of the
airline's pilot's union said its engines may have failed to restart
at the pilot's command.
   The jet went into service in April for Air France and British
Airways, and last Thursday, Air France took delivery of the plane
that crashed.
   The Airbus A320 is the first civilian airliner equipped with a
fully computerized flight-control system, which the manufacturer
says permits safer, electronically controlled flight.
   The aircraft carries 168 people and consumes 40 percent less
fuel than similar two or three engine jets.
   The Northwest agreement calls for delivery of up to 100
A320-200s between 1990 and 1995. Northwest must make a firm
commitment on 10 A320s for delivery in 1990 and 1991.
   The Toulouse, France-based Airbus Industrie consortium says it
has more than 500 orders or letters of intent to buy the A320.
France, Britain, West Germany and Spain are partners in Airbus.

<TEXT>
   A third South African has been
arrested in connection with an army incursion into Botswana,
authorities said Monday.
   Barry Viviers appeared in magistrate's court on a charge of
unlawful possession of a hand grenade found at his home Friday.
   Police said Viviers, who lives in Gaborone, had been in contact
with a suspected South African commando, Theodore Hermansen, on the
day before the June 20 cross-border mission.
   During the incursion, a five-member South African army unit
fired at a group of Botswana policemen, injuring three officers.
Those five soldiers escaped back to South Africa, but Hermansen and
a colleague, Johannes Basson, were arrested at a roadblock and have
been charged with violating Botswana's National Security Act.
   Viviers, 20, was ordered held pending a bail application later
this week. He was born in Botswana but lived for most of his life
in South Africa before returning to Gaborone a few years ago.
   South African officials have said the army unit entered Botswana
on an intelligence mission as part of the campaign to combat the
African National Congress guerrilla movement. It has neither
confirmed nor denied Botswana's allegation that Hermansen and
Basson were linked to the mission.
   Botswana said the commandos planned a raid on a target in
Gaborone and has accused South Africa of ``state terrorism.''
   South Africa claims its soldiers fired at the policemen after
being fired at first. Botswama says the police patrol was unarmed.

<HEAD>Reformer: Trotsky Unlikely To Be Restored To Party Ranks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading reformer said Monday he doubts Leon
Trotsky will be restored to Communist Party ranks even if the
revolutionary's role in securing Bolshevik power is recognized and
his writings published.
   Asked by a Greek reporter whether Trotsky would be
rehabilitated, Otto Latsis, deputy editor of the monthly Kommunist,
said ``there are different kinds of rehabilitation.''
   Trotsky may undergo what Latsis termed ``civilian
rehabilitation'' in that his contribution to the Bolshevik
Revolution and to winning the civil war against the White Guards
should be recognized, he said.
   Restoration to party ranks was another matter, he said.
   ``I don't think there is any basis for that,'' said Latsis.
``Trotsky was not excluded from the party in 1937, but in 1927 for
his anti-party activity.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in November that a
Central Committee commission would review the cases of those who
had suffered under dictator Josef V. Stalin and would restore honor
to people who were unjustly repressed.
   Since then, revolutionaries Nikolai V. Bukharin, Lev Kamenev and
Grigory Zinoviev are among those who have been formally cleared of
what are now seen as trumped-up charges in show trials in the late
1930s. But they have not been restored to party ranks.
   Leading historian Yuri N. Afanasyev said on June 17 that Trotsky
should be exonerated of criminal charges and his works republished
for all.
   Trotsky has been reviled for half a century as a traitor and the
arch-enemy of socialism.
   Recognition of his revolutionary role would directly counter an
orthodoxy that has gone unchallenged for 60 years. It would also
signal how deeply the Soviet Union is now questioning the legacy of
Stalin, who ruled the country from 1924 to his death in 1953.
   Born Lev D. Bronstein, the son of a Jewish farmer, Trotsky was a
central figure in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the architect
of the Red Army's victory in the civil war that followed it.
   He served successively as commissar for foreign affairs and then
for war, but was bested by Stalin in the infighting which followed
the death of Vladimir I. Lenin in 1924.
   After his expulsion from the party in 1927, Trotsky was expelled
from the country in 1929. In the 1936-38 show trials that
accompanied Stalin's bloody purges, Trotsky was accused of treason.
In 1940, he was murdered in Mexico City, reportedly by a Soviet
agent.
   Talking about rehabilitation for Trotsky, Latsis said, ``We have
to stop the atmosphere around Trotsky, he played an important role
in the civil war and the revolution. We have to look at the role he
played, not more, not less, not better, not worse.''
   ``His books should be available,'' Latsis added. ``They are
historical documents and a contribution to the general struggle.
Soviet people should know about them.''
   Afanasyev said on June 17 that all those accused on false
evidence should be rehabilitated, including Trotsky.

<HEAD>Senate Cuts IRS Budget, Diverts Money to Anti-Drug Efforts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate passed a $15.9 billion 1989
spending bill for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and
several other agencies today that diverts money from the Internal
Revenue Service to anti-drug programs.
   The lawmakers approved the measure on a 81-4 vote. The House
version of the legislation would spend $196.3 million more for the
agencies, so the two chambers will have to work out their
differences before sending the bill to President Reagan for his
signature.
   The bill would cut the IRS budget proposed by Reagan and
approved by the House by $241 million to just under $5.1 billion,
the same amount the agency is spending this year. The money would
instead be given to the Customs Service, which would have a budget
of $1.05 billion.
   Administration officials have complained that the reduction in
the IRS coffers would hinder that agency's ability to collect taxes
for the government and to process returns quickly. IRS Commissioner
Lawrence B. Gibbs has complained that the reduction could cut
revenues by $1.4 billion next year.
   As part of the Customs Service efforts against illegal drugs,
the bill recommends the agency buy a surveillance airship capable
of carrying a sensor that can detect ship movements in the Gulf of
Mexico. The measure includes money for Customs to develop four
long-range P-3 planes to use in drug surveillance missions.
   The bill also calls for a 4 percent pay increase in 1989 for all
federal civilian employees except members of Congress, and 4.1
percent for military personnel.

   Americans believe the anti-war protests that
convulsed the country 20 years ago changed society, but they are
divided over whether the change was for the good, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   The national survey of 1,204 adults found many respondents at
loggerheads over the effect of the protests of the 1960s. Agreement
was restricted to one key point: Three-quarters said the unrest had
a lasting effect on society.
   A slight majority, 51 percent, said the effect was positive, the
survey found. But 41 percent said the anti-war demonstrations'
effect on society was negative overall. The rest had no opinion.
   In another measure, 57 percent said the protests had a lasting
effect on U.S. foreign policy, and they were split evenly on
whether that effect was positive or negative.
   A majority also thought the protests influenced U.S. policy in
Vietnam. When asked if the effect was to prevent the United States
from winning the war, 58 percent said no, but 30 percent said yes.
   The protests of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War reached a
crescendo in 1968, as demonstrators occupied college campuses and
battled with police during the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
   Of the poll respondents who said the protests influenced U.S.
policy in Vietnam, 59 percent said the effect was to shorten U.S.
involvement in the war. But 23 percent said the protests prolonged
the war.
   People who called themselves conservatives were more likely to
say the anti-war protests prevented the United States from winning
in Vietnam, and that the protests had a negative effect on American
society and U.S. foreign policy.
   Overall, 52 percent said they think society is more liberal now
than it was in 1968. But few said they personally are more liberal
now; more called themselves more conservative and most said they
are about the same.
   Majorities in the poll agreed with statements characterizing
young people today as less activist and more self-interested than
youth of 20 years ago. Seventy-one percent agreed that ``young
people are more selfish now than they were 20 years ago,'' and just
23 percent disagreed.
   More than 60 percent agreed with statements that young people
``were more interested in change'' and ``were more idealistic'' 20
years ago; less than a third disagreed. Smaller majorities said
youth now are more apathetic and at the same time more realistic.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone
interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204
adults across the nation. It has a three-point margin of error.
   Media General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond,
Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News

<TEXT>
   A Williamsburg County weekly newspaper
editor has been indicted on charges of criminally libeling two
state lawmakers, court officials announced today.
   The charges were brought by state Rep. B.J. Gordon and state
Sen. Frank McGill, both Democrats, after editor Jim Fitts wrote a
column urging voters to reject the politicians in the June primary
and accused them of stealing.
   The charges were presented to a grand jury, and Fitts showed no
reaction as the jury's decision was read. He said afterwards that
he was looking forward to telling his story in court. ``I got what
I wanted,'' he said.
   Though libel cases are not unusual, criminal libel cases that
can send a journalist to jail are. The Williamsburg County case is
believed to be only the fourth involving journalists in 40 years in
South Carolina and the first since 1984.
   The case will be tried in late August or early September,
Solicitor Wade Kolb has said. If convicted, Fitts could face $5,000
in fines and a year in prison on each of the two counts.
   Wallace Connor, attorney for both lawmakers, said he was
satisfied with the indictment.
   ``I think Mr. Fitts has gone too far with it. He apparently
wants to have the publicity regardless of what, so we'll
accommodate him,'' he said. ``I think he's got a million dollars
worth of publicity for a slander sheet.''
   Fitts, 62, said he would ask to move the trial from Williamsburg
County.
   ``The power structure has long roots in Williamsburg County,''
he said.
   Fitts, editor of The Voice, a black-oriented newspaper with a
circulation of 2,300 in a poor, rural county of about 40,000, riled
Gordon, who is black, and McGill, who is white, with a column in
his May 17 edition.
   Fitts wrote, in part: ``I will say to you, without fear of
contradiction, if every black in Williamsburg County would start
stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives,
they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their
time in power.''
   The column gave no specifics, and when asked later what he
thought they had stolen, he said only that they had taken the pride
of people of Williamsburg County. Both politicians won their June
14 elections.
   Fitts, who was jailed for two nights on the charges before being
released on bond, said Thursday that an indictment and jail term
might help him by drawing more attention to the problems of blacks
in the county.
   ``I've always been opinionated,'' he said. ``I just have an
opinion and I have no problem sharing it.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press in Washington, has said that Fitts made a
political statement about two politicians.
   ``It seems to me that punishing someone for speaking is not an
American concept,'' she said.

<HEAD>Brawley Advisers Blast Giuliani and TV Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advisers to Tawana Brawley, the young woman who
refuses to help police investigate her charges that she was
assaulted, are accusing a federal prosecutor and a television
reporter of conspiring to obstruct justice.
   Meanwhile, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins questioned
the tactics of the three advisers, accusing them of doing damage to
the civil rights movement with their ``wild charges.''
   Dinkins, the city's highest-ranking elected black official, made
his comments Sunday about the Rev. Al Sharpton and Brawley
attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. on WABC-TV's
``Eyewitness News Conference.''
   The Brawley case began when the teen-ager was found last
November in a plastic bag smeared with dog excrement. She claimed
that she had been raped and assaulted by six white men.
   Her family and family advisers have since claimed that she
cannot get justice from authorities and her family has refused to
cooperate in the investigation.
   At a news conference Sunday, Mason and Sharpton threatened a
$100 million lawsuit against WCBS-TV in response to Saturday's
arrest of Samuel McClease.
   McClease had claimed in an interview with the station that he
had tape recordings that would cast doubt on the Brawley story, but
tapes he gave to federal authorities were blank and he was charged
Saturday with obstruction of justice and perjury.
   ``Certainly with the arrest of Mr. McClease, Channel 2 (WCBS)
has knowingly participated in slandering me, slandering the
Brawleys and slandering the advisers,'' Sharpton said.
   McClease, 26, a self-proclaimed surveillance expert, claimed
that Sharpton had hired him to bug conversations involving Mason
and Maddox.
   In the WCBS broadcast, McClease said the tapes revealed that
there was no evidence to support the black teen-ager's contentions
that she was abducted by a gang of white men, and that the advisers
knew this.
   The advisers said Sunday that they want WCBS reporter Mike
Taibbi and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani to explain why they gave
credence to McClease.
   ``Rudolph Giuliani and Mike Taibbi met, agreed, conspired,
combined to obstruct justice in the Tawana Brawley case,'' Mason
said. Maddox was not at the news conference.
   Sharpton said Giuliani helped Taibbi ``undermine black
leadership'' by subpoenaing McClease.
   Giuliani said, ``The statements are illogical and not worthy of
response.''
   Phyllis Stewart, a spokeswoman for WCBS-TV, said the station
would have no comment on the advisers' statements.
   Dinkins said on WABC-TV that he was particularly bothered by
comments Sharpton, Maddox and Mason have made about Gov. Mario
Cuomo and state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The advisers have compared Abrams, who is special prosecutor in
the case, to Adolf Hitler and labeled Cuomo a racist.
   ``I don't think they help their cause or ours by calling the
governor and Robert Abrams and others names,'' Dinkins said. ``I
mean, just wild charges, unsubstantiated and, I am confident,
untrue.''
   ``As they seek to focus on the inequities in the criminal
justice system ... they don't do the cause any good and they
certainly don't appear to be assisting the cause of bringing to
justice the culprit in the Tawana Brawley situation,'' Dinkins said.

   The Supreme Court today gave communities
nationwide broader power to ban picketing of private residences.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said such bans do not necessarily
violate free-speech rights.
   The decision is a defeat for anti-abortion activists who were
barred from picketing a doctor's home in the Milwaukee suburb of
Brookfield, Wis.
   The ruling could also represent a significant setback for unions
locked in labor disputes.
   In another case, the court gave defense contractors important
protection against lawsuits by people who accuse them of making
defective equipment that causes death or injury.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, refused to reinstate a $725,000
award to the family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a
1983 crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.
   In the picketing case, a Brookfield ordinance that outlaws
``picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any
individual'' is tailored narrowly enough to protect freedom of
speech while protecting residents' privacy, the court said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
ordinance is limited to ``picketing taking place solely in front of
a particular residence.''
   ``So narrowed, the ordinance permits the more general
dissemination of a message,'' O'Connor said. ``General marching
through residential neighborhoods, or even walking a route in front
of an entire block of houses, is not prohibited by this ordinance.''
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said
Brookfield's ordinance makes it ``unlawful for a fifth grader to
carry a sign (saying) `Get Well Charlie _ Our Team Needs You' in
front of a residence for a period of time necessary to convey its
friendly message to its intended audience.''
   An anti-abortion group, the Milwaukee Coalition for Life,
demonstrated in front of Dr. Benjamin Victoria's home in Brookfield
on at least six occasions in 1985.
   Victoria performs abortions as part of his medical practice in
Milwaukee and Appleton, Wis.
   The demonstrators carried signs protesting abortion and shouted
slogans, such as ``Dr. Victoria, you're a killer.''
   The demonstrations ranged in size from 11 to more than 40 people.
   In the month that the picketing occurred, the Brookfield Town
Board enacted the disputed ordinance, challenged in court by
demonstrators Sandra C. Schultz and Robert L. Braun.
   U.S. District Judge John W. Reynolds in Milwaukee barred
Brookfield from enforcing the ordinance by issuing a preliminary
injunction.
   He ruled that the ordinance probably is unconstitutional because
a public street is the type of traditional public forum where a
flat ban on speech cannot be tolerated.
   An evenly divided 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
injunction.
   Today, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court ruling.
   ``Because the picketing prohibited by the Brookfield ordinance
is speech directed primarily at those who are presumptively
unwilling to receive it, the (town) has a substantial and
justifiable interest in banning it,'' O'Connor said.
   ``The nature and scope of this interest make the ban narrowly
tailored. The ordinance also leaves open ample alternative channels
of communication and is content-neutral,'' she said.
   Ms. Schultz, head of the Milwaukee Coalition for Life, said, ``I
understand that marching is still okay and we can go up and down
the block a little further. I'm a little confused about the
distinction and how far we have to go down the street before it's
legal. ... So we will just change our tactics and go a little
further down the street. It won't deter our movement.''
   Harold Furhman, an attorney hired by town of Brookfield, said,
``I'm very delighted with the decision and feel that it is
consistent with the argument ... throughout, both in our oral
arguments and in our briefs.''
   No matter what form or type of speech is involved, past court
rulings have let government place reasonable restrictions on the
``time, place or manner'' of expression.
   But such restrictions must be content-neutral, be narrowly
tailored, serve a significant governmental interest and leave open
alternate channels for communicating the same message.
   During oral arguments last April, Fuhrman contended for
Brookfield that the ordinance was aimed only at pickets who
concentrated on one particular home, and not at those who chose to
parade through a residential neighborhood with their messages.
   The justices appeared then to find signficance in that
interpretation of the ordinance, and in the fact that the
anti-abortion group was free to picket Victoria at his places of
business or in Brookfield's two commercial areas.
   At one point during the April argument session, Justice Antonin
Scalia said to the demonstrators' lawyer, ``You want to harass this
doctor. You want to stick your thumb in his eye. Isn't that what
this is all about?''
   O'Connor's opinion adopted Fuhrman's interpretation of the
ordinance.
   Brookfield's ordinance had been defended in
``friend-of-the-court'' briefs submitted by the National League of
Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Association
of Counties.
   The picketers were supported by an unusual coalition of
organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the
anti-abortion American Life League, Christian Advocates Serving
Evangelism and the AFL-CIO.
   Joining O'Connor in upholding the ordinance were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Byron R.
White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Joining Stevens in dissent were Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Loosened the requirements for law enforcement agents to first
obtain court warrants before conducting searches on private
property.
   The justices split 4-3 in ruling that evidence initially
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trial
if the same evidence is ``rediscovered'' during a second, lawful
search.
   _ Agreed to decide whether military veterans' disability
benefits indirectly may be subjected to a state's community
property law when they divorce.
   The court said it will review a ruling that California's
required splitting of benefits with ex-spouses does not violate
federal law.
   _ Let stand a ruling that grants an exemption from state sales
taxes to high-stakes bingo games run by Indian tribes.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Oklahoma
officials seeking to impose the tax on revenue from a bingo game in
Tulsa run by the Muscogee Creek Nation.
   _ Agreed to decide whether prison officials sometimes must
explain why they bar an inmate from having visitors.
   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court ruling
that a Kentucky prison's visitation program created a ``liberty
interest'' for inmates that cannot be infringed without due process.
   _ Said federal judges have substantial authority to award fees
to lawyers who win suits against the government.
   The justices, voting 6-2, said a California anti-poverty law
firm is entitled to recover legal fees for successfully challenging
the withholding of federal housing subsidies.
   The picketing case is Frisby vs. Schultz, 87-168.

   ``Right Behind the Flag'' by Kevin Heelan is one
of those mysterious little comedies that starts strong and then
fades in the finish, in this case because of a murky plot
permutation involving drugs.
   Heelan's angry banter is fast, funny and frequently on target as
it illuminates the angst of an air-conditioner salesman named
Bernie who has little good to say about the state of the world,
particularly what is happening to his rapidly gentrifying
neighborhood on Manhattan's West Side.
   Bernie rails against the world, particularly its moral
bankruptcy and then is faced with a crisis when his good friend
Frankie stands to make a lot of money from the distribution of
``high-tech pharmaceuticals'' to Manhattan yuppies.
   Kevin Spacey exposes his soul and a great deal more in capturing
Bernie's manic desperation. The actor sustains the character's
intensity even when the story sags. It's fascinating to watch his
anger grow, wondering how or if he can contain it.
   But Heelan lets the play get away from him, particularly when he
mixes in a female reporter (Amy Aquino) who shows some feeling for
Bernie and a baby-faced drug kingpin played with smarmy skill by
Paul McCrane. Neither is developed satisfactorily.
   ``Right Behind the Flag,'' a production at off-Broadwa's
Playwrights Horizons, can be savored for Spacey's performance.
Otherwise, it's a dead-end for much of Heelan's dark dialogue.

   ``There are 8 million stories in the naked city, and you don't
want to hear any of them,'' proclaims a character in ``Urban
Blight,'' a new musical revue at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater
Club.
   Yes, you do, particularly since some of the stories are by such
talented writers as Christopher Durang, Wendy Wasserstein, Jules
Feiffer, George C. Wolfe, Terrence McNally and A.R. Gurney Jr.
   As in an any revue, there are high and low points, but the peaks
outnumber the valleys in ``Urban Blight,'' and director John
Tillinger doesn't let the evening dawdle.
   Wolfe's scabrous satire of lovemaking in the 1980s is
particularly funny, ending with the partners wrapping themselves in
Saran Wrap before the final fadeout. Equally mirthful but just as
unsettling is Durang's look at one of those female comics who will
do anything for a laugh, even insult themselves. It contains a
terrific performance by the squeaky-voiced Faith Prince who
displays a superb sense of timing.
   More somber topics are covered by ``Andre's Mother,'' McNally's
poignant examination of what happens after the death of an AIDS
victim, and a monologue by Arthur Miller on what a burglary does to
one's sense of material possessions.

   ``V & V Only,'' a new play by Jim Leonard, has a modest sense of
place, but almost no sense of story to hold an audience's interest.
The season finale at off-Broadway's Circle Repertory Company
concerns the crumbling of the old order _ in this case, an old
Italian coffee shop in New York's Little Italy, giving way to the
gentrification.
   The coffee shop in all its fading linoleum glory has been
captured perfectly by set designer John Lee Beatty. Playwright
Leonard has more trouble defining its owner and customers. Most
come through as cliches _ the ailing owner, Vito; his dumb but
good-natured assistant; a vulgar but wisecracking cop who's always
looking for a handout and a lonely widow who complains about her
daughter.
   The play's one interesting character is Nick, played with the
right degree of macho defiance by Erich Anderson. He's the
superintendent of the building and stands to make the most when the
building goes co-op. But Leonard doesn't do much with Nick, except
set him up for the evening's violent and unsatisfactory conclusion.
``V & V Only'' is one little restaurant to avoid.

   Heard about the upscale Ben & Jerry's ice
cream from Vermont? How about some Shorty & Blondie's from Oklahoma?
   Shorty and Blondie are mules that crank out homemade ice cream
when attached to an ice cream making machine assembled by Bud
Potter.
   ``It's just like making ice cream on the back porch, but instead
of using a handle to turn the freezer, a pair of mules does the
job, walking around the freezer in a circle,'' Potter said.
   Potter, his brother, Don, and Ed Atkin, began making the
mule-powered ice cream last summer, and they attract a crowd
whereever they go.
   Atkin selected Shorty, a 600-pound white mule, to turn the
freezer.
   ``He's a good little mule and he can do it,'' Potter said. ``But
it's pretty hard to do it by himself. It's better with two (mules)
on it.''
   That's when Blondie, a matching mule, entered the picture.
   ``Ed hand-picked them to make it look just right,'' Potter said.
``The mules need to be a certain size and matched up to look good.''
   Once the mules get started, it takes about 20 minutes and 12
sacks of ice to turn out a freezer full of ice cream, Potter said.
   ``Shorty knows all about making ice cream, but he doesn't like
it. He likes oats and alfalfa hay,'' Potter said.

   This small town's designation as a ghost
town has some of its 700 residents irked.
   ``How dare he say we're dead? We're not dead,'' said Ruth
Schoenhofer, who has lived in St. Paul for 40 years.
   The town in southeast Kansas is included in a new traveler's
guide called ``Ghost Towns of Kansas,'' by Topeka historian Daniel
Fitzgerald.
   ``We'd love to have him come down here on a Friday night,''
agreed Betty Brogan. ``He could just see how much action there is
around here.''
   St. Paul has a post office, construction company, bank, fire
department, tavern, a couple of beauty shops, three gas stations
and a high school graduated 19 students last month.
   Fitzgerald, 29, an archivist at the Kansas Center for Historical
Research in Topeka, said he has been baffled by the fuss.
   He said he never claimed in his book that the town was actually
dead. Instead, he said, he defines a ghost town as ``a shadowy
semblance of its former self.''
   He said he included St. Paul in his book because the town's
regional importance and population has declined in the last hundred
years.

   A natural gas explosion early today
destroyed a three-story building and killed six people, including
four members of one family, in this tourist village near Naples,
authorities said.
   Firemen rescued Anna Di Somma, 14, but said her parents and two
teen-age brothers died in the apartment building blast. The girl
was listed in good condition at a local hospital with a broken hip
and leg.
   Officials did not elaborate on the cause of the explosion.
   Authorities said they had recovered the bodies of Luis Carlo
Rossi, 33, and Carlo Ingravalle, 27, who shared one of the two
apartments destroyed by the blast.
   Firemen also recovered the body of Gerardo Di Somma, 46.
However, officials said his wife, Maria Rosaria Masolli, and their
two sons, Antonio Di Somma, 19, and Raimondo Di Somma, 17, were
still buried under the ruble.
   Officials said the bodies had been located, but that efforts to
recover them had been hampered because of fears that a portion of
the building still standing might collapse.

   A federal judge today denied requests to call
Attorney General Edwin Meese III as a defense witness in the
racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi and six others.
   The defense wanted U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley to
allow them to call Meese, asserting that it was he who ``acted
corruptly'' in helping the Wedtech Corp.
   Biaggi, his eldest son, and five others are charged with turning
Wedtech, a now-bankrupt defense contractor, into a racketeering
enterprise that paid bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts.
   The defense wanted to call Meese and a former top aide of his to
show that Wedtech had connections with high Reagan administration
officials and didn't need to bribe Biaggi, D-N.Y., for his
assistance.
   But the judge ruled that Meese's testimony was ``not relevant to
anything that this jury has to decide'' about Biaggi's guilt or
innocence.

<HEAD>Economy No Boon for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is facing ``the worst
of both worlds,'' a new poll suggested Monday, getting little help
from voters' satisfaction with the short-term state of the economy
while being hurt by fears about the long-term fate of the nation.
   The vice president trails Democrat Michael Dukakis in the survey
conducted for the Times Mirror Corp. However, the Massachusetts
governor is not well known to most of the public, and that gives
Bush an opening to tighten the race in the fall, said analyst
Norman Ornstein.
   ``This poll doesn't tell who will win the election,'' Ornstein
told reporters. ``For most Americans, Michael Dukakis is a blank
slate. In the next couple of months, there will be a lot written on
the slate, and not just by Dukakis _ but also by the media and by
George Bush and the Republicans.''
   The survey, the latest in a series for the media company
conducted by the Gallup Organization, is based on interviews with
3,021 adults in person from May 13-22. The margin of potential
sampling error was two percentage points.
   The horse-race numbers for the poll gave Dukakis 53 percent of
the registered voters and Bush 40 percent. Seven percent were
undecided.
   Bush's relatively weak showing could be partly a result of being
saddled with the role of vice president. But conventional wisdom
would also suggest that he should benefit from the nation's
economic prosperity during the final six years of the Reagan
administration.
   Indeed, many people are optimistic about their own finances and
the national economy over the coming year. Fifty-four percent think
they will be personally better off next year, while only 10 percent
say their financial situation will deteriorate.
   Twenty-four percent think the national economy will improve in
the next year, while 46 percent believe there will be little
change. Twenty percent are pessimistic.
   But Ornstein said, ``Bush has gotten the worst of both worlds,''
pointing to poll findings that the public is very concerned about
the long-term future and a feeling that things are out of control.
   Only 41 percent of the public was satisfied with ``the way
things are going'' in the country while 54 percent were
dissatisfied, the poll said.
   An indicator of the depth of the fears was the finding that 37
percent said it is likely or certain that the U.S. economy could
collapse in the next 10 years because of foreign competition.
   Thus Bush is not getting a boost from the economic picture,
while he is suffering from concerns about the Reagan
administration's stewardship.
   Forty-three percent of those questioned said the Democratic
Party ``can bring about the kinds of changes the country needs,''
with only 27 percent labeling the GOP that way. Nine percent said
both parties, 11 percent said neither and 10 percent were not sure.
   And this gives Dukakis much of his strength.
   ``Democrats are seen as the party of change; Bush is not,'' said
Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization.
   Overall, Dukakis drew a favorable response from 66 percent of
the sample, while 22 percent rated him unfavorably. Bush got 51
percent positive marks and 42 percent negative.
   But the Dukakis numbers are the result of a ``vague, mildly
positive image,'' the poll analysis said, pointing out that
relatively few voters could rate Dukakis on a range of specific
characteristics.
   Bush's image is a bit clearer, since he has been on the national
scene longer, but he is stuck with ``some strong negatives and
relatively few positives,'' the analysis said.
   Asked in the poll if they were voting more for their candidate
or against his opponent, Bush backers were mostly positive. Of his
40 percent support, 26 percentage points were based on pro-Bush
sentiments and 11 percent anti-Dukakis. Three percent were not sure.
   But half of Dukakis' supporters took a negative stance. Of
Dukakis' 53 percent, only 22 percentage points were pro-Dukakis; 26
percent were anti-Bush; and the rest were not sure.
   The Times Mirror surveys over the past year have divided the
public into 11 groups based on their values and partisan
affiliation.
   Dukakis is doing well in part because he is drawing strong
support from usually Democratic groups. In fact, the poll said that
Democrats are slightly more loyal to Dukakis at this point than
Republicans are to Bush _ a dramatic change from the high rates of
Democratic defection in recent decades at the presidential level.
   Bush has solid backing from key GOP groups. But the vice
president has not won the strong support Ronald Reagan had in a
group the poll calls the ``Disaffecteds,'' those who are
pessimistic and deeply suspicious of both big government and big
business.

   Police seized 123 pounds of heroin smuggled
into Italy from Turkey in meat trucks and arrested 13 people on
drug trafficking charges, investigators said Monday.
   Police estimated the street value of the heroin at $58.3 million.
   Thirteen people _ including two Yugoslavs, one Turk and one
Austrian _ were arrested and charged with drug possession and
trafficking.
   Most of the heroin was smuggled into Italy through Yugoslavia
and Austria aboard Turkish trucks transporting meat.
   Earlier searches of apartments in Italy of alleged ring members
led to the seizure of several pounds of heroin, nearly seven pounds
of cocaine and about 3 million lire (about $250,000) in cash.

   The light green leaves of some trees in
the middle of the dark green forest of Michigan's Lower Peninsula
have the fragile look of spring's new growth, and some scattered
trees show exposed, brown branches.
   The thinner growth is evidence of a ravenous little caterpillar
_ the juvenile stage of the gypsy moth _ that is making life
miserable for uncounted people across the United States.
   And the drought is increasing the damage, as trees already
weakened by lack of water try to fight off the effects of repeated
defoliation by the hungry caterpillar.
   ``Now, the trees are fighting just to stay alive,'' said Jim
Hanson, forest entomologist for the U.S. Forest Service in St.
Paul, Minn.
   Trees will use up food reserves putting out a new growth of
leaves, he said. ``They don't have anything left, and they start
declining.''
   Two or three defoliations can kill a tree, and the drought may
hasten that process, said Frank Sapio, forest pest specialist for
the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
   The caterpillar likes oaks best and can kill 20 percent to 30
percent of the trees in a three-year infestation, Hanson said. But
the pest eats more than 200 plant species.
   From its initial foothold in New England, the gypsy moth is
slowly expanding its territory westward and southward. It's been
detected in all of Michigan's 83 counties.
   Experts offer little hope for homeowners driven to distraction
by caterpillars covering their houses and lawn furniture, stripping
their trees, defecating everywhere and stinking when they die.
   ``They are literally dripping off the eaves of homes,'' said
Ronald Priest, manager of the gypsy moth program for the Michigan
Department of Agriculture.
   Sue Eiseler moved to the Harrison area about three years ago,
but already she and her husband are thinking about leaving.
   ``We are totally covered,'' she said. ``This is the third year
our trees are totally stripped. It's a like a nightmare.''
   ``If they're chewing, you can sit and listen to them,'' state
Rep. Sid Ouwinga said. ``When you start getting 20 calls a day from
your constituents in one county, you know you have a problem.''
   There's no real threat to human health, although some people can
be allergic to the caterpillars.
   Experts have given up any hope of eradicating the pest and
endorse spraying chemicals only in selected spots. Other than that,
they advise people to reduce the nuisance by scraping gypsy moth
egg masses off houses and outdoor furniture and trying to keep the
caterpillars out of trees by putting bands of burlap or sticky
substances on the trunks.
   ``The biggest thing is for people to understand _ teaching them
that we can't eradicate them,'' said Rob Hallet, Clare County
chairperson for gypsy moth education. ``They're miserable, they're
a nuisance, but they're here. We can't get rid of them.''
   ``People demand something be done _ that translates into using
pesticides,'' Priest said. But at least one lawsuit filed by
environmentalists has blocked spraying of one chemical in part of
Clare County.
   ``That can be dangerous _ they're spraying poisons,'' Hallet
said.
   A map shows heavy infestations along the East Coast from Maine
to Maryland, some presence in Ontario and Quebec, wide infestations
covering much of Lower Michigan, spot outbreaks in Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and some detection of
the pest in Oregon and Washington.
   ``The female lays its eggs on just about anything,'' Hanson
said. ``When people move, they're transporting these egg masses
around the country.''
   According to experts in various states, a naturally occurring
virus killed many of the pests in Massachusetts; Ohio and Illinois
are generally free of the insect now; Connecticut expects to near
1987's figure of 127,452 acres defoliated; spraying in Oregon and
Minnesota reduced their problem; and the problem is in its earliest
stages in Colorado.
   In 1985, Michigan began a joint federal-state-local program of
voluntary spraying in 37 counties, and officials are testing
insects which feed on the moths. The state paid $250,000 for
spraying this year.

   Here are events in the investigation of
alleged procurement fraud and bribery involving government
officials, defense contractors and consultants:
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   TUESDAY, JUNE 14: Pursuing what FBI spokesman Gregory Jones
calls ``allegations of fraud and bribery,'' FBI and Naval
Investigative Service agents raid the offices of Pentagon
officials, defense contractors and consultants.
   More than 30 locations are searched in 12 states and the
District of Columbia. Law enforcement sources say the searches are
part of a two-year probe that has included wiretaps.
   Targets include Melvyn Paisley, a former assistant Navy
secretary who became a consultant to several aerospace contractors
immediately upon leaving the Pentagon. Also searched are the
Pentagon offices of Victor Cohen, a top Air Force acquisitions
official, and James Gaines, deputy assistant Navy secretary for
acquisitions, as well as offices and plants of some of the
country's largest defense contractors, including McDonnell Douglas
Corp. in St. Louis, United Technologies Corp. in Washington and
Unisys Corp. in Minneapolis and New York.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15: Government sources say that the office
telephones of Cohen and Gaines were tapped. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater says President Reagan did not learn of the massive
investigation until Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THURSDAY, JUNE 16: A search warrant issued in the investigation
states that McDonnell Douglas improperly received large amounts of
confidential Pentagon information from Paisley. Law enforcement
officials say some 275 subpoenas have been served.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says indictments may be handed
down in 30 to 90 days. Sources say Meese was not told of the probe
until late March because his name came up on a wiretap.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   FRIDAY, JUNE 17: Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and Bill Chappell,
D-Fla., deny reports that they are involved amid reports that the
office of at least three House members were put under scrutiny.
   Two more defense contractors _ LTV Corp. and Martin Marietta
Corp. _ acknowledge that they have been served with subpoenas.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SATURDAY, JUNE 18: A second search warrant reveals that the FBI
believes that Pratt & Whitney obtained confidential documents that
rival jet engine maker General Electric Co. had given to the
Defense Department in bidding for engine contracts worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.
   The warrant is used to search the offices of Eugene Tallia, vice
president of Pratt & Whitney and head of the company's Washington
office.
   Sources tell The Associated Press that U.S. Attorney Henry
Hudson, who is heading the investigation, answered, ``No comment''
when asked by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, whether former Navy
Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. is a target of the probe. Newspaper
reports, quoting unidentified sources, say investigators have
uncovered evidence that Lehman learned of the probe and warned
Paisley that he was under investigation. Neither could be reached
for comment. The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun report
that also under investigation are activities of the late Rep.
Joseph Addabbo, D-N.Y., who was chairman of the House
Appropriations defense subcommittee.

<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SUNDAY, JUNE 19: Four members of Congress who oversee
procurement policies say management problems _ and a ``good old boy
network'' in the Reagan administration _ were at fault.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he knew ``we did not have the kind of people in the
Pentagon at high levels that really had background in management.
We had people being selected for their ideological beliefs, for
their salesmanship, but not for good sound management.''
   Reagan, attending an allied summit meeting in Toronto, declines
to comment on the reports about Lehman having tipped off Paisley.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MONDAY, JUNE 20: Grassley says the Justice Department was
``asleep at the switch'' three years ago when a Pentagon
investigator discovered that defense contractors and consultants
were illegally obtaining Pentagon secrets. Meese denies the
accusation, saying that ``at no time has this department had to be
dragged into any indictment where the evidence is there.'' Meese
also refuses to say whether Lehman is under scrutiny.
   Top Defense Department officials discuss whether to suspend
officials implicated in the investigation.
   Three other congressmen _ Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., Andrew
Ireland, R-Fla., and Sam Stratton, D-N.Y. _ are reported on the
list of those under scrutiny, but not targets, in the case.
Chappell says no one in Congress is involved in the investigation,
but declines to give the basis for his statement.
   The U.S. attorney coordinating the probe, Henry Hudson of
Virginia, says 270 subpoenas have been issued.
   Three more defense contractors: Hercules Inc., Gould Inc. and
the Electronic Data Systems Corp., say they have been served with
subpoenas.

   TUESDAY, JUNE 21: Sources familiar with the cast say the
government has won the cooperation of someone whose voice turned up
frequently on court-ordered wiretaps, and a second target of the
probe appears on the verge of cooperating. One wiretap involves a
conversation between Lehman and Paisley.
   Pentagon spokesmen say Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has
issued a directive specifying that any Pentagon employee under
scrutiny in the bribery probe must be reassigned.
   President Reagan, in a news conference in Toronto at the end of
the economic summit, said he was ``very upset'' about reports of
wrongdoing. But he praised investigators for ferreting out the
misdeeds and said it was ``understandable how such things'' could
happen in a government bureaucracy.

   WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22: House Speaker Jim Wright says ``no member of
the House is under investigation'' in the case.
   Prosecutor Henry Hudson meets with members of Congress. The
corruption case is focusing on 75 to 100 defense contracts worth
``tens of billions of dollars,'' says Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Joan Galvin, an aide to Ireland and daughter of William Galvin,
another figure in the probe, is relieved of handling military
issues for the congressman.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in an interview,
denies responsibilty for whatever corruption may be found. ``No
matter how careful you are, you're not going to be able to
eliminate dishonesty,'' he says.
   BDM International Inc. of McLean, Va., is reported to have been
served with a subpoena. Paisley's wife Vicki is an employee of the
company.
   Court files show that Walter R. Edgington, then a vice president
of GTE Government Systems Corp., told federal agents four years ago
that a private consultant routinely provided his company with
secret Pentagon documents.

   THURSDAY, JUNE 23: President Reagan says he has arranged for a
report on the status of the investigation.
   The Los Angeles Times reports that investigators believe Gaines
was a principal supplier of Pentagon documents to Paisley. The
newspaper saaid Paisley arranged an elaborate scheme under which
high-level Pentagon officials smuggled classified documents out of
the Pentagon and allowed him to copy them with the aid of his wife.
The newspaper says Paisley allegedly passed the information to
McDonnell Douglas, which paid him ``staggering fees.'' An attorney
for the Paisleys denies the allegations.
   Gaines is revealed to be cooperating with authorities.
   A former Boeing Co. executive, James Durst, says he passed along
information to the government more than six years ago that Paisley
had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping operation and of
conducting bribery internationally on military projects.

   FRIDAY, JUNE 24: Federal and state records show that Mrs.
Paisley received $50,000 in payments from a defense consulting firm
set up by Galvin.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee considers legislation to
allow the government to suspend payments to defense contractors
under investigation in the case. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
offered the proposal but later withdrew it.

   SUNDAY, JUNE 26: Sources say investigators videotaped meetings
in which Defense Department officials allegedly took payoffs from
consultants. The sources say Gaines and Cohen appear on some of the
videotapes, as does Paisley. The sources tell the Associated Press
the tapes show Gaines was present when classified documents changed
hands.
   The Washington Post, meanwhile, reports that Cohen is
cooperating in the investigation.
   The Los Angeles Times reports that Paisley was able to get his
Pentagon post with high security clearance despite allegations
dating back a decade that he had bribed government officials and
wiretapped competitors while working for the Boeing Co.
   Weinberger, in a national television interview, answers
congressional critics of his Pentagon stewardship by saying: ``When
you're running one of these departments with approximately 3
million people involved, you're at the mercy of the person, or one
or two people, who may be dishonest.''

<HEAD>Boys From One-Parent Homes Likely to Complete Less Schooling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The more time that children _ especially boys
_ spend in one-parent homes, the less schooling they are likely to
complete, university researchers say.
   And time spent with a single parent during the formative,
pre-school years seems to have a particularly negative impact on a
boy's future education, according to Sheila Fitzgerald Krein and
Andrea H. Beller of the School of Human Resources and Family
Studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana.
   Single, working mothers appear to provide greater incentive, as
a role model, for their daughters than their sons, Beller said in a
telephone interview Monday. She said that while the role-model
influence, in the case of girls, appears to compensate for the
mother's loss of time at home, ``the boy doesn't have this model,
he just has the loss of a parent.''
   With the nation's increasing divorce rate, about 60 percent of
all children are now estimated to spend at least some of their
childhood in a single-parent situation, Krein and Beller reported.
   ``This trend has aroused social concern in part because these
families typically have fewer resources, in particular time and
money, than two-parent families,'' they reported in Demography, the
journal of the Population Association of America.
   ``Educational advancement is one route out of poverty, but the
children in these families get significantly less of it. Thus, this
lower level of education will have long-term consequences for the
economic well-being of the future family of this young adult,'' the
report states.
   While many studies have focused on the psychological
consequences for children in one-parent families, few have looked
at the long-term economics, the report went on.
   The two Illinois researchers said they studied effects on
education because it ``has been shown to be a predictor of welfare
recipiency and persistent poverty'' and ``lack of education is one
determinent of chronic unemployment.''
   Beller and Krein used a pair of long-term surveys to study two
generations of mothers and their offspring, totaling 2,500 boys and
girls.
   ``In general, the longer time spent in a single-parent family,
the greater the reduction in educational attainment,'' they found.
   The largest impact was among white males, they reported, with
each year spent in a one-parent family reducing eventual education
by about one-tenth of a year.
   ``White men who spent an average number of years (5.1) in a
single-parent family completed 0.5 fewer years of schooling than
those who spent none; white men who spent all 18 years in a
single-parent family completed 1.7 fewer years of schooling,'' they
found.
   Black males, on average, spent 8 years in a one-parent
situation, and received 0.6 year less schooling than those who
spent their entire childhood in a two-parent home. Black males
spending 18 years with just one parent finished 1.3 fewer years of
school.
   The impact was much less significant for women. Indeed, for
white women time spent in a single-parent family had no impact on
eventual education. The impact was slight for black women.
   ``This suggests room for a powerful role-model effect of the
working mother,'' reported Krein and Beller.
   A follow-up study, not yet published, found that the effect of
the missing parent is reduced, although not eliminated, in cases
where the father pays child support, Beller added.
   In these cases, though the father may not be present, he still
serves as a good role model and ``that affects educational
attainment in a positive direction.''
   The greatest impact on eventual education was among youngsters
whose pre-school years were spent in one-parent families, the study
said. It suggested that ``Since the pre-school years matter most,
affordable day-care with an educational component could replace
some of the functions of the absent parent.''
   Living in a family with brothers and sisters _ thus reducing the
time available for the parent to concentrate on any one child _
also reduced eventual educational attainment, Beller and Krein
found. Again, the effect was most pronounced among boys.
   Factors the researchers found to boost educational attainment
were higher family income, amount of reading materials in the home
and the mother's education. The father's education appeared to be a
factor among whites, but not blacks, they added.

<HEAD>Texas Treasurer Ann Richards to Be Democratic Keynoter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Richards announcement, subbing top 2 grafs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats' pre-convention pace accelerated today as the
party named Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards to be the
convention's keynote speaker and as apparent presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis scheduled a quick trip to Washington to talk with
senators about a running mate.
   The choice of Ms. Richards to give the nationally televised
address was announced at a news conference in Washington. Earlier,
Dukakis aides said the senators with whom he'll meet on Wednesday
will include several mentioned as possible vice presidential
candidates.
   One possible source of friction at the party convention eased,
when Dukakis rival Jesse Jackson praised a proposed platform worked
out in Denver.
   The developments came as a new poll indicated that Dukakis is
continuing to run well ahead of Vice President George Bush, the
likely Republican presidential nominee, although it suggested there
is plenty of room for voters to change their minds since Dukakis is
still ``a blank page'' to many.
   Bush was back in Washington today after a one-day trip to
Columbus, Ohio, where he singled out defense issues as a key
battleground for the summer campaign. Dukakis was wrapping up a
four-day vacation on Nantucket.
   The selection of Ms. Richards as convention keynoter was said to
have originated with party officials, although the Dukakis campaign
embraced it.
   Ms. Richards is the first woman elected to statewide office in
Texas in 50 years, and her selection is likely to be seen as a
Democratic effort to court not only women's votes but Southern
support as well.
   Dukakis press secretary Mark Gearan said the Massachusetts
governor had decided to delay by a day a scheduled campaign trip
through the Midwest in order to spend Wednesday in private meetings
with 30 or more senators on Capitol Hill. But officials also said
the Massachusetts governor would spend part of his time talking
with prospective running mates.
   Dukakis has said he hopes to make his decision before the
convention opens on July 18, although aides dismissed published
reports that an announcement could be made this weekend.
   Dukakis' aides last week sent out requests for background
information on several prospective running mates, including Jesse
Jackson, Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio and Bob
Graham of Florida, as well as House Democratic Leader Tom Foley of
Washington.
   Others mentioned as possible running mates include Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana. Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, who sought the presidential nomination, also
has been mentioned.
   The Gallup poll released today showed Dukakis with a 13-point
lead over Bush, 53 percent to 40 percent, with 7 percent undecided.
The survey, based on interviews with 3,021 adults from May 13-22,
had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. Its results were in
line with a string of surveys putting Dukakis' edge at 10 points or
more.
   But the poll, conducted for the Times Mirror Corp., also
indicated that Dukakis' lead came more from voters' negative
feelings about Bush than positive feelings about the Democratic
nominee-to-be.
   Dukakis tried to keep his island sojourn nearly free of campaign
business. Gearan said Sunday the governor had not even talked by
telephone with aides in Denver, where platform drafters were at
work on a campaign manifesto.
   The document that emerged conformed more closely to the wishes
of the Dukakis camp than those of the Jackson forces.
   Jackson's calls for raising taxes on the rich, freezing the
Pentagon budget, pledging no first use of nuclear weapons and
supporting a Palestinian homeland were all turned aside.
   Still, Jackson said today on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
``In some measure, our mission is to find common ground in the
committee structure.''
   ``Where that cannot take place, we'll take it to the floor and
simply let the people air it out in the public,'' he said. However,
he added, ``Lets look at the plus side. There is language in that
platform about a pension fund, a reinvestment plan, that's a step
in the right direction. A commitment to fight drugs, a commitment
to a new Soviet-U.S. approach to third world development, a
commitment to ending apartheid in Southern Africa.''
   And Democratic rule-makers, meeting Saturday in Washington,
agreed to an overhaul of party rules _ which Jackson hailed as a
``victory for the people. ... a victory for democracy.''
   Under the agreement, the number of ``super delegates'' to the
1992 convention will be cut nearly in half, and all the other
delegates would be awarded to presidential candidates in proportion
to public suppor.
   During the primary season, Jackson bitterly criticized
delegate-selection rules, complaining that his delegate total did
not reflect his proportion of the popular vote.
   Bush was in Washington today, after a one-day trip to Columbus,
Ohio, where he blamed Congress for hampering the administration's
drug war.
   ``Congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs,
but when it comes to law enforcement, some of them go AWOL,'' or
absent without leave, he told a police group.
   The vice president told reporters traveling with him on Air
Force Two he would be spelling out foreign policy differences with
Dukakis. On defense in particular, he said, ``a very serious debate
... has not yet been joined.''
   ``Obviously he (Dukakis) will have to join it,'' he said. ``I
think I will come out well on that.''
   Bush criticized Dukakis' calls for unilateral nuclear weapons
cuts. ``How do we defend if we eliminate these systems he's calling
for?'' he asked.

   A new Airbus A320 which crashed and killed three
passengers had flown too low when it made a pass during a
demonstration flight at an air show in eastern France, officials
said Monday.
   The Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority, Daniel
Tennenbaum, told a Paris news conference that the Air France jet
flew at an altitude of 30 feet when it made a low-flying pass over
an airfield near Mulhouse Sunday. He said the determination came
from a preliminary investigation of the crash.
   Fifty passengers were injured.
   In the eastern French town of Mulhouse, state prosecutor Jean
Volff also said the preliminary investigation of the crash showed
the plane was flying too low.
   ``The A320 passed at 30 feet altitude, which is completely
outside the technical norms when it is carrying passengers,'' Volff
said.
   Tennenbaum said the fully computerized aircraft needed eight
seconds to respond to the command of the pilot who, because of the
low altitude, had only five seconds to maneuver the plane upward.
   A spokesman for Airbus Industrie, the aircraft's manufacturer,
said earlier there were indications that human error caused the
crash Sunday of the Air France jet, which was carrying 133 people,
but the president of the airline's pilot's union said its engines
may have failed to restart at the pilot's command.
   Transport Minister Louis Mermaz said ``nothing for the moment
calls into question either the functioning of the aircraft or the
big Airbus project.''
   
   The narrow-bodied Airbus A320, developed by a European
consortium over four years at a cost of $2 billion, is the new
entry in the commercial aircraft market and a jet advertised as the
fastest-selling plane in aircraft history. It went into service in
April.
   The Air France twin-engine plane clipped some trees and plunged
from about 60 feet into a forest at the end of the airfield in
front of TV cameras and a crowd of about 1,000 people attending the
show. The aircraft burned and sent a pillar of black smoke in the
air.
   Only the plane's red, white and blue tail remained unscorched.
   A control tower official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the jet appeared to lose power as it passed over the field in
Habsheim, a village about 15 miles from the Swiss border.
   Christian Roger, the pilot's union president, had said there
were indications that ``the engines failed to restart'' at the
pilot's command.
   Unlike other planes, he said, connections from the controls to
the engines are made through the computer and not directly by
cables.
   The newspaper l'Humanite reported today that pilot Michel
Asseline told a rescuer, ``I wanted to increase the power, but the
aircraft did not respond.'
   Jean-Marie Schreiber, a reporter for the newspaper L'Alsace who
was aboard, told the daily newspaper France-Soir he felt a jolt
when the plane started to climb after passing over the field.
   ``Then, all of a sudden, I had the feeling we had hit a pothole,
and I saw trees from the window,'' he said.
   One passenger, Roland Schmitted, said, ``We were flying low, and
I was afraid there would be a catastrophe ... I am a pilot, and I
said to myself, he's never going to make it over those trees.''
   He said passengers were able to get out after fire broke out
because the crew put down the evacuation chutes almost immediately.
   Officials said 50 people required hospitalization and some were
badly burned. They said there was only a rudimentary passenger list
and some aboard may have left the crash site without identifying
themselves.
   Air France and British Airways, which each have two A320s,
temporarily grounded their planes as a precaution. On Monday,
however, British Airways said it will resume using the aircraft on
Tuesday, saying i was satisified the plane is safe.
   No American airline uses the A320 yet, although Egan,
Minn.-based Northwest Airlines has 100 of the planes on order and
New York-based Pan American World Airways has 16 ordered with an
option to buy 34 more.
   In addition, two U.S. leasing companies have ordered the A320 _
GATX Air of San Francisco has asked for 10 of them and
International Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., has
three on order.
   Air France took delivery just Thursday of the plane that crashed
and flew it six times on Saturday.
   Airbus, a Toulouse, France-based consortium, says it has more
than 500 orders or letters of intent to purchase the A320. France,
Britain, West Germany and Spain are partners in Airbus.
   The French news agency Agence-France Presse reported Monday that
the Airbus 320 has had two serious electrical problems since April,
the first on the inaugural flight March 26 and the second June 23
on a flight that was to have gone to Amsterdam, but did not depart.
   The aircraft carries 168 people and consumes 40 percent less
fuel than similar two or three engine jets.
   It is the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully
computerized flight-control system, which the manufacturer says
permits safer, electronically controlled flight.
   Instead of the old control column in front of the pilot, there
is a ``pistol-grip'' side stick linked to five computers that
modify and relay the pilot's directions to wing and tail flaps.
   In the event of total failure of the electrical flight control
system and all computers, the jet is equipped with a mechanical
cable link to the tail that would allow the pilot to fly manually,
although with reduced maneuverablity.
   The plane operates with a two-man flight crew. Earlier this
year, pilots and flight engineers of France's largest domestic
carrier, Air Inter, called a series of protest strikes, saying
three crewmembers were needed for safety.
   Newspapers quoted Romain Kroes, a union spokesman, as saying
Sunday's accident proved the necessity for a third person in the
cockpit. He said a flight engineer is needed to take over manual
controls in case of failure of the electronic system of supplying
the plane's engines with fuel.
   Mermaz said both black boxes with flight data had been recovered
and officials were studying them.
   The government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said pilot Asseline and co-pilot Pierre Mazieres were not injured
and should be able to help investigators.
   The plane had flown from Paris and landed in Mulhouse, about 320
miles to the east, to take on additional passengers and was to
circle Mount Blanc in the Alps, then return to Paris via Mulhouse.

   A suspended Fulton County Commissioner who was
convicted last month on three counts of extortion was sentenced
today to six years in prison and fined $25,000.
   U.S. District Judge Orinda Evans sentenced A. Reginald Eaves to
six years on each of two counts, to run concurrently, and a
six-year suspended sentence on a third count, with five years on
probation.
   The judge also said he may not seek elective or appointive
office while in jail or on probation.
   The commissioner was accused of taking payments of $20,000 and
$10,000 from an undercover FBI agent posing as a developer in
exchange for his vote on a rezoning matter. Eaves said the payments
were for consulting work.
   The government had sought a 12-year sentence and fines and
restitution totaling $300,000. The defense had suggested community
service.
   Eaves has been suspended from his seat on the county commission,
and defense attorney David Walbert refused today to say whether
Eaves would appeal his conviction.
   Eaves would be likely to serve about 18 months of the six year
sentence before being eligible for parole, said Walbert.
   Meanwhile, Eaves was replaced by state Rep. Mary Young-Cummings
as president of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials.
   Mrs. Young-Cummings, of Albany, has been acting president of the
black politicians' group since Eaves' conviction. She was named
president Saturday as the group's 18-member executive board met in
Savannah.
   Fulton County, with a population of almost 600,000, includes
most of the city of Atlanta.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   PICKETING
   
   The court gave communities nationwide broader power to ban
picketing of private residences.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said such bans do not necessarily
violate free-speech rights.
   The decision is a defeat for anti-abortion activists who were
barred from picketing a doctor's home in the Milwaukee suburb of
Brookfield, Wis.
   The ruling could also represensetback for unions
locked in labor disputes.
   The case is Frisby vs. Schultz, 87-168.
   
   MILITARY Ct a significant ONTRACTOR
   
   The court gave defense contractors important protection against
lawsuits by people who accuse them of making defective equipment
that causes death or injury.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, refused to reinstate a $725,000
award to the family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a
1983 crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.
   The case is Boyle vs. United Technologies Corp., 86-492.
   
   SEARCHES
   
   The court loosened the requirements for law enforcement agents
to first obtain court warrants before conducting searches on
private property.
   The justices split 4-3 in ruling that evidence initially
discovered during an unlawful search sometimes may be used at trd to usher
in the cashless society has instead
given cash a fresh boost with the spread of automatic teller
machines, or ATMs.
   In 1977, there were about 10,000 ATMs around the country. Today
the total exceeds 80,000.
   These machines are available to dispense cash to consumers at
any time of day or night, and their proliferation has doubtless
changed the way many people go about spending and managing money.
   Banks have been quick to adopt ATM systems in lieu of employing
more human tellers as a way to lower their operating costs.
   Another incentive for banks to promote their ATMs, Walker says,
lies in their dealings with the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed charges banks a fee for wire transfer of funds and for
processing checks. But it imposes no such fee for its
cash-processing services.
   The credit card has, meanwhile, been dealt a significant setback
under tax reform. The tax deduction for interest paid on consumer
interest is being reduced in stages to zero by 1991.
   Of course, many people pay their monthly credit-card balances in
full, so that they seldom or never incur interest charges. There
are also increasing numbers of debit cards, with which purchases
are processed just as if a check had been written.
   Still, amid all the plastic and paper, coin and currency
continue to hold a prominent position. Concludes Walker, ``Visions
of a cashless society are likely to remain just that. Cold cash
will be with us for some time to come.''

<HEAD>Jury Recommends Death for Carpenter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury today recommended that David J.
Carpenter, convicted of five Northern California murders, be
executed in the gas chamber for the so-called ``Trailside
Slayings.''
   Carpenter, 58, already has been sentenced to death for the 1981
killings of two 20-year-old women in Santa Cruz County parks.
   The series of attacks along popular Northern California hiking
trails panicked outdoor enthusiasts and left the parks nearly empty
of hikers for months.
   Carpenter, whose criminal history includes 17 years imprisonment
for crimes including attempted murder and rape, was convicted May
10 by the same San Diego jurors for the five 1980 Marin County
shootings.
   The victims were Cynthia Moreland, 18, of Cotati; Richard
Stowers, 19, of Petaluma; Anne Alderson, 26, San Rafael; Diane
O'Connell, 22, San Jose, and Shauna May, 25, San Francisco.
   Superior Court Judge Herbert Hoffman scheduled a July 19 hearing
for Carpenter's formal sentencing. He can either follow the jury's
recommendation or sentence Carpenter to life imprisonment without
possibility of parole.
   The trial was moved to San Diego because of pretrial publicity.
   Carpenter's defense was based on a claim that his troubled
childhood, including physical and mental abuse, and psychological
problems mitigated circumstances in the killings.
   Jurors hearing the case in San Diego were not told of previous
convictions and sentence for the Santa Cruz murders of Ellen Marie
Hansen and Heather Scaggs.
   The Santa Cruz case was heard in Los Angeles Superior Court in
1984 on a change of venue, also granted because of heavy publicity.

<TEXT>
   A minister has stacked up four boxes
full of cards from thousands of people expressing sympathy and
support for victims' families and survivors of the school bus
accident that killed 27 people.
   ``It sort of charges me up for the day,'' Don Tennison, pastor
at Radcliff First Assembly of God, said recently. ``It's been these
cards and things like that that've really helped keep me and my
wife going.''
   Fifteen members of First Assembly were among those killed May 14
when the bus was hit by a pickup truck. The bus was carrying riders
home from an amusement park. The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, later
was charged with 27 counts of murder.
   Tennison's son, Allen, was one of the 40 people who survived the
accident.
   ``There's some beautiful mail in there,'' said church secretary
Judy Wilson, nodding toward the boxes containing letters, poems and
cassette tapes.
   Branwyn Suko, a sixth-grader from Auburndale, Fla., printed a
letter to grieving parents, telling them: ``I'm sorry to hear that
your child was killed in the bus wreck. I'm sure he-she was very
nice. God will take care of it. I'm a Christian. Just keep praying.
I will pray for you.''
   Amanda Briggs, a member of a United Methodist Church in State
College, Pa., simply scribbled, ``Hang in There'' on a card filled
with other expressions of love and compassion.
   In a May 17 letter to church members, President Reagan wrote:
``Nancy and I were stunned and saddened to hear of the tragedy that
befell your church. ... Our hearts and prayers go out to each of
you.''
   Reagan urged the church members to ``take comfort, in the days
to come, in remembrance of your loved ones.''
   Tennison said that after parents and survivors take the mail
they want, he hopes the rest can be displayed in a special part of
the church library.

<HEAD>Door Should Stay Open for New Zealand Return to ANZUS, Australian
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia's defense chief said Monday the door
should be kept open for New Zealand to return to the three-cornered
military alliance with his country and the United States despite
the nuclear weapons dispute that brought New Zealand's ouster.
   Defense Minister Kim Beazley commented on the eve of the annual
ministerial meeting of the ANZUS pact. New Zealand was excluded
from it two years ago for barring U.S. nuclear-armed or -powered
warships from its ports.
   ``I can't say I see any developments in either New Zealand or
U.S. policy pointing to compromise,'' but ``it is very important to
hold open the possibility'' of restoring trilateral relations,
Beazley told reporters.
   Since the breakup, he said, ``We have tried to ensure that our
bilateral relations with the U.S. and with New Zealand are fully up
to speed, and substantial ... we'll continue on that course but do
not want to act in any way that would prevent the return to
trilateral.''
   Beazley said he assumes New Zealand ``would want to get back
into trilateral ANZUS arrangements'' if possible and must be
watching the current Washington meeting with interest. ``Of course
we talk to New Zealand constantly about our strategic perceptions
and relationships in our area,'' he added.
   Beazley and Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden are to meet
Tuesday and Wednesday with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and
Secretary of State George Shultz at the annual ANZUS session, which
also covers includes foreign policy, economic and procurement
matters.

<HEAD>SEC Calls Insider-Trading Case Second Biggest Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission today
charged an analyst with Morgan Stanley Group Inc. with profiting
from inside information in what an SEC official called the second
biggest insider trading case the agency has ever handled.
   The SEC filed a civil complaint against Stephen Wang Jr., an
analyst in Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions department.
   The complaint asked the federal court in New York to order the
return of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple that
amount in damages.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case is the
second biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC,
dwarfed only by a case brought in late 1986 against Ivan Boesky.
   Also named in the complaint was Fred C. Lee, a Hong Kong
businessman who allegedly traded on the information supplied by
Wang.
   Wang had been with Morgan Stanley for two years and had been in
the mergers and acquisition division for one year, Lynch said in an
interview.
   ``Over the course of the last year, we allege that he funnelled
information to Fred Lee, who then traded on that information,''
Lynch said.
   Investigators alleged in the complaint that Lee had attempted to
move money out of the United States and for that reason funds in
bank accounts should be frozen.
   Lynch said that investigators are alleging that the trading on
inside information involved stock in about 25 different companies
including E.F. Hutton, Stop & Shop Cos. and Utah Power & Light Co.
   Morgan Stanley said in a brief statement that it had suspended
Wang pending an investigation. A source at Morgan Stanley, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the firm had been cooperating
with SEC officials for some time in connection with Wang's
activities.
   Wang, 24, was a junior analyst on a two-year training program
for college graduates, the source said. He was only months away
from completing the program when the SEC announced its action
against him.
   The SEC complaint against Boesky was filed in November 1986.
Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million to settle civil charges
that he traded stocks on the basis of insider information provided
to him by Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Both Boesky and Levine are serving sentences in minimum security
federal prisons.
   The SEC complaint against Wang and Lee, who is a Taiwan citizen,
comes after a House investigating committee charged earlier in the
month that the SEC was not doing enough to pursue insider trading
by foreigners.
   A subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committeee had
charged that insider trading by foreigners was growing as traders
became more sophisticated in cloaking their identity by purchasing
U.S. stock through overseas banks.
   But SEC Chairman David Ruder had defended his agency's handling
of investigations involving foreigners, saying the SEC had made
substantial progress in coordinating investigations with other
countries.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed outrage Monday
over Mexico's release of a Puerto Rican nationalist wanted in the
United States for terrorist activities.
   William Morales, 37, was released from prison late last week
after serving five years of an eight-year term for the murder of a
Mexican policeman. Mexican officials said he also was granted
political asylum.
   Morales was reportedly released after Mexican Foreign Secretary
Bernardo Sepulveda rejected a U.S. request for his extradition on
the ground he was a ``political fighter for the independence of
Puerto Rico'' who had been ``politically persecuted.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, who indicated that
the United States had not been informed officially of Morales'
release, said allowing him to go free ``would be a serious blow to
international efforts to combat terrorism.''
   He said Morales was implicated in a 1975 plane bombing in New
York in which four people were killed and 60 injured and has been
sentenced to over 100 years in prison in the United States on
weapons possession charges.
   ``We are outraged and surprised by reports that Mexican
authorities may have released Mr. Morales,'' Redman said.
   Morales was arrested in New York in 1978 after a bomb he was
making detonated, blowing off most of both hands and disfiguring
his face. He escaped from U.S. custody a year later.
   He was said to be a leader of a Puerto Rican independence group
called the Armed Forces of National Liberation.
   Morales was arrested by Mexican authorities in 1983 after a
shootout with police in which a companion and a Mexican policeman
were killed. He received an eight-year prison term.
   Redman said U.S. officials have been told that Morales has been
turned over to the Mexican Secretariat of Government, which will
decide his eventual disposition.
   He said the administration is trying to clarify reports that
Mexico may grant Morales political asylum.
   ``We would be deeply disturbed that an individual with Morales'
record of criminal behavior, a convicted felon in both our
countries, should even be considered for possible political refugee
status,'' Redman said.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will give a
lengthy report at Tuesday's long-awaited Communist Party
conference, delegates said, but they cautioned against expecting
major changes or shifts in the party elite.
   The heads of delegations streaming into Moscow from each of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics and from the dozens of regions of the
sprawling Russian Republic huddled to decide who will sit on the
key steering bodies of the first conference of its kind in 47 years.
   Officials have said the presidium directing the conference will
decide which of the 5,000 delegates gets to speak at the forum,
expected to last at least until July 1.
   Viktor G. Afanasyev, editor of the Communist Party daily
newspaper Pravda, said Gorbachev would deliver a ``big and
interesting'' report after the delegates gather in the Kremlin's
modern glass and marble Palace of Congresses on Tuesday.
   But one delegate who has seen the party chief's speech said
privately there would be ``no surprises'' and that Gorbachev would
follow the broad outlines set earlier by the party's policy-making
Central Committee.
   Gorbachev announced in January 1987 that he wanted to call a
general conference, the first since 1941 and only the 19th in
Communist Party history. For months afterward, officials and
reformers suggested that radical changes would be decided at the
forum, which was seen as a watershed for the Kremlin's new policies.
   Slogans fluttering all over Moscow talk of a ``revolutionary
change,'' and officials insist the conference will help make
Gorbachev's ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, irreversible.
   But they concede it is unlikely that some of the most radical
reforms proposed in weeks of fervent discussion in the state-run
media will be approved at the conference.
   ``There is a lot of waiting for a miracle,'' said Otto Latsis, a
conference delegate and deputy editor of the monthly journal
Kommunist. ``But you can't expect that the day after the
conference, we will wake up in paradise.''
   Latsis' comments reflected a general effort by party officials
and reforms in recent days to play down expectations that the
conference would fundamentally change the course of society.
   Diplomats and other foreign analysts suggested the tactic was
intended to make any gains Gorbachev does make for his reform
policy appear as a significant strengthening of his leadership
position.
   Latsis said the forum won't decide on specifics of economic
policy but will concentrate on uniting the party behind a new
definition of the Communists' role in Soviet society.
   The original proposals for the conference, known as theses, were
published last month after being approved by the Central Committee
on May 23.
   The theses contained a few specific proposals for reform, such
as limiting office holders to a maximum of two five-year terms in
any one post, and a much broader but more vague program to
dismantle the remnants of the authoritarian rule of Josef V. Stalin.
   The Stalinist past is likely to be a topic of discussion as the
party tries to determine its role following Gorbachev's calls for
Communists to withdraw from day-to-day administration and play a
more political role in setting general goals for society.
   Echoing Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin's slogan of ``All power
to the soviets,'' the theses suggest that the power of the local
governing councils known as soviets should be strengthened.
   Latsis told reporters he believed workers in the party apparatus
should be barred from election to the councils in an effort to
divide power and increase the accountability of the Communist Party.
   But more conservative voices have insisted the party must keep
firm control over all aspects of society, as it has for most of the
70 years since the 1917 revolution.
   Some reformers had predicted the conference would elect a new
Central Committee, enabling Gorbachev to weed out old-timers and
install younger, more dynamic figures on the policy-setting body.
   Yuri A. Sklyarov, head of the Central Committee's propaganda
department, said Monday, however, that the election of new Central
Committee members is not on the conference agenda.
   There are 60 to 70 ``dead souls'' among the 300-plus members on
the Central Committee. ``Dead souls'' are those who have either
died or lost the jobs that entitled them to seats since the last
Central Committee was elected in 1986.
   Sklyarov suggested Thursday that new members might join the key
body. But he and another Central Committee official, Georgy
Kryuchkov, said Monday there was no reason why people who had
retired from previous posts should lose their Central Committee
seats now.

   President Reagan on Monday reiterated his
faith in the innocence of former aides Oliver L. North and John M.
Poindexter and said he expects they would be exonerated if tried.
   During a photo session with visiting Turkish President Kenan
Evren, Reagan was asked if he favored speeding up the
declassification of documents considered necessary for the trials
of North and Poindexter.
   ``Well, I hope that we could,'' he replied.
   ``I believe in the innocence of the two men and I would like to
see that established once and for all.''
   The White House had said last week that it favored legal
proceedings in the Iran-Contra case going forward, but said the
question of setting a trial date is up to the judge and the
prosecutors.
   Reagan has refused to say whether he would grant pardons to
North and Poindexter, former National Security Council aides ousted
in November 1986 amid revelations that proceeds from secret arms
sales to Iran had been diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.

   A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled Monday
that defense contractors enjoy broad protection from lawsuits when
defective equipment they sell to the government causes death and
injury.
   The ruling was denounced by dissenting justices as a
``breathtakingly'' far-reaching grant of immunity to the nation's
defense industry. They also accused the court of unlawfully
usurping congressional power and said the ruling seems to apply as
well to non-military contractors.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court refused to reinstate a $725,000 award
to the family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a 1983
crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.
   The ruling, coming at a time when Pentagon contracting is under
extraordinary scrutiny, marks the first time the justices have
extended broad legal protection to companies that supply military
equipment.
   The ruling is not related to the current federal investigation
into alleged fraud and bribery in military procurement.
   The court said a contractor is protected from suit when it makes
equipment conforming to ``reasonably precise'' Pentagon
specifications and the company warns the government about any
potential dangers of which it is aware.
   The ruling also could be a help to Morton Thiokol, manufacuturer
of the booster rockets for the space shuttle Challenger. A leaking
seal on one of the booster rockets was blamed for the Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts.
   The company has reached a $7,735,000 settlement with four of the
astronauts' families in which it contributed 60 percent and the
government 40 percent of the money.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in his opinion for the court Monday,
said shielding government contractors from suit is a vital public
concern.
   If a company may be sued easily, ``either the contractor will
decline to manufacture the design specified by the government or it
will raise its prices. Either way, the interests of the United
States will be directly affected,'' Scalia said.
   ``We are of the view that state law which holds government
contractors liable for design defects in military equipment does in
some circumstances present a significant conflict with federal
policy and must be displaced,'' he said.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``The
court's newly discovered government contractor defense is
breathtakingly sweeping.''
   He said, ``This court lacks both authority and expertise'' to
fashion the guidelines set by Scalia. The Constitution demands that
job be left to Congress, Brennan said.
   He also said the ruling could apply to non-military contractors.
For example, he said, a company that designs a government building
may be immune from suit ``when the elevator cable snaps or the
walls collapse.''
   The court previously has ruled that members of the armed
services may not sue the government over injuries suffered in
connection with the military service.
   Monday's ruling appears to give military contractors even more
extensive legal protection in some cases. For example, Scalia said,
the manufacturer of a jet engine ordered by the government should
be protected from being sued by civilians who say the engine is
needlessly noisy.
   Monday's case stemmed from a federal jury award of $725,000 to
the family of David Boyle, who drowned April 27, 1983, in the crash
of a Sikorsky CH-53 helicopter.
   Boyle survived the crash impact, but he was unable to force his
hatch to open against the pressure of the water.
   His family said the design was defective, because the hatch
should have opened inward to permit pilots to escape.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May 1986 threw out the
jury award against the helicopter manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,
and its parent company, United Technologies Corp. The appeals court
said Sikorsky relied upon the Navy's design.
   The Supreme Court sent the case back to the 4th Circuit court,
but only to restudy a narrow issue.
   The justices said the appeals court ruling will stand unless the
appeals court improperly acted as a trial court and decided itself
that the facts of the case established the military contractor
defense.
   Joining Scalia were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy. The dissenters, besides Brennan, were Justices Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.

   The nation's largest organization of doctors
began debate Monday on a wide range of AIDS proposals, including
recommendations for testing the nation's prison population and for
states to trace the sex partners of infected people.
   The proposals were part of a main report and four background
papers approved by the board of trustees of the American Medical
Association and set for action by the 420-member house of delegates
representing 295,000 doctors before its annual policymaking
convention ends Thursday.
   Included in the AMA board's proposals are recommendations that:
   _The nation expand treatment programs for intravenous drug
abusers, because they pose the most explosive potential for
spreading the deadly disease into the heterosexual population.
   _U.S. women infected with the AIDS virus avoid breast feeding to
reduce the chance of giving the disease to their children.
   _``Vigorous enforcement'' of existing antidiscrimination laws to
protect AIDS victims.
   _The president to create a new, national AIDS commission
identical to the one that recently finished its work ``to provide
the essential coordination between public and private institutions
that are addressing AIDS.''
   ``This is a disease we can't become casual about,'' said Dr.
John Dawson, an AMA trustee and a surgeon from Seattle. ``We're
still waiting for the explosion of cases that will arouse the
country.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's ability
to fight disease and is spread primarily through sexual
intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from breast-feeding
mothers to their infants. It is fatal and incurable.
   By 1991, the nation likely will have 270,000 cases of AIDS, the
report said, affirming previous estimates by other groups.
   In 1986, 148,060 people were tested in the United States for
infection by the AIDS virus and 22,775, or 15.4 percent, tested
positive, the main report said. Preliminary results for 1987 showed
that 623,493 people were tested and 17,629, or 2.8 percent, tested
positive.
   The report attributed the drop in positive tests to the opening
of new testing centers in areas with a low prevalence of AIDS.
   The AMA board recommended that all states without contact
tracing seriously consider launching such programs in an effort to
slow the disease's spread among heterosexuals.
   ``You have the potential for a frightening expansion of AIDS
into the heterosexual community,'' Dawson said. ``That's where
contact tracing would be important.''
   But the AMA acknowledges that legal or other issues may block
such programs, Dawson added.
   The report also reaffirms the AMA's call for mandatory AIDS
testing of all prison inmates because of the high prevalence of
infection among them.
   However, the AMA's proposed policy calls on prisons to take
steps to protect the confidentiality of AIDS-infected prisoners.
   Several delegates and health officials spoke against the
proposal Monday, saying it wouldn't serve any purpose unless
AIDS-infected inmates were segregated from other prisoners and that
testing may be too costly.
   A report focusing on intravenous drug abusers recommends that
federal and state governments increase funding for free drug
treatment programs, but stopped short of calling for providing drug
addicts access to clean, uncontaminated needles as some countries
have begun doing.

   A federal judge Monday approved a settlement
of a desegregation case that will use new attendance boundaries and
``magnet'' schools to promote integration, but does not include
busing.
   The plan also calls for immediate repairs to inner-city schools
with predominately black enrollments.

parties well,'' said U.S. District Judge W. Brevard Hand in
approving the proposal for the Mobile County school system.
   With that, the judge ended a 15-minute hearing and set into
motion a five-year program geared toward racial equality.
   The Mobile County system, Alabama's largest, has about 65,000
students in the city of Mobile and Mobile County, which together
have a population of 350,000. Enrollment in the school district is
about 44 percent black.
   The desegregation case, known as the Birdie Mae Davis lawsuit,
was filed 25 years ago by a group of black parents. Miss Davis was
a pupil at the time.
   The agreement, worked out by the parties in the case, calls for
strict adherence to new attendance zones and the creation of more
magnet schools. Such schools offer courses in special fields such
as the arts or sciences and are designed to draw students from
throughout the district.
   The plan does not include busing of students.
   The Mobile County School Board last week unanimously approved
the agreement.
   ``It's the beginning of the end of the case,'' James U.
Blacksher, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said Monday. The school
system remains under court jurisdiction, however, until the
agreement is carried out.
   Over the years, the school system had presented various
desegregation proposals to the court, some of which were carried
out, but none had received court approval.
   ``If we can carry out what's in the agreement we're going to
have a beautiful school system,'' said Robert Gilliard, school
board president and head of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Under the plan, buildings will be renovated, including immediate
repairs to predominately black Blount High School, which would have
been torn down under an earlier proposal. Blacks led a community
drive to save the school.
   School Superintendent Billy Salter said the school system has
$10 million available to begin the renovations required by the
court. Those funds were set aside for planned construction of a
high school that is no longer required under the settlement.

<HEAD>Traditionalists Claim Canon Law Allows Consecration</HEAD>

   The traditionalist movement of Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre on Monday challenged the Vatican's warning that Lefebvre
will be automatically excommunicated if he consecrates four bishops
without papal approval.
   The consecration, scheduled for Thursday at a seminary in Econe,
Switzerland, would lead to the first schism in the Roman Catholic
church in more than a century.
   In a letter to the media, the director of the Econe seminary
cited a German expert on canon law that no sanctions can be applied
by the church against the faithful who act in an emergency.
   The Rev. Alain Lorans said in the letter it was ``wrong to claim
that the code inflicts this punishment automatically without taking
into account certain cases of emergency.''
   Lorans cited passages from a book published in 1984 by Georg
May, a professor at the University of Mainz, who wrote that ``an
emergency situation justifies emergency rights.''
   ``Those rights can only be claimed if all possibilities to
restore the normal situation by positive (valid) law have been
exhausted,'' May wrote. ``In an emergency situation, the pastors of
the church can take extraordinary measures to protect or restore
the activity of the Church.''
   The Rev. Roland Trauffer, secretary of the Swiss Conference on
Bishops and an expert on canon law, confirmed that canon law
provides immunity for those breaking it in an emergency.
   ``But it is wrong to claim that Lefebvre acts in a state of
emergency,'' Trauffer told The Associated Press in an interview.
``An emergency is something unforeseeable, something that occurs
suddenly without warning and in which the person concerned has no
possibility to communicate with the pope.''
   Lefebvre's plan to consecrate bishops was announced last year.
It is to ensure the ``continuity'' of the church that he says is
threatened by ``neo-protestantism'' and other ``auto-destructive''
trends since the Second Vatican Council 1962-65.
   The 82-year-old prelate has been suspended from his priestly and
episcopal functions since 1976 for his campaign against the
conciliar reforms, especially against new guidelines on religious
freedom and more contacts with other faiths. In defiance of this
ban, he has ordained more than 200 priests and has scheduled 16
more ordinations at Econe on Wednesday, on the eve of the
consecration of the four bishops.
   The bishops to be consecrated are Richard Williamson,
48-year-old English-born head of the Ridgefield, Conn.,
traditionalist seminary; Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, 43-year-old
secretary general of the traditionalist St. Pius X; Alfonso de
Galarreta, 31, Spanish-born head of a seminary at Buenos Aires,
Argentina; and Bernard Fellay of Switzerland, 30-year-old chief
administrator of Lefebvre's fraternity.
   Galarreta and Fellay are under the canonical age requirement of
35 for bishops.
   Preparations for the ceremonies were in full swing at Econe, a
vineyard-flanked hamlet in the Swiss canton of Valais where
Lefebvre's fraternity was founded _ then with official approval _
in 1970.
   A tent has been set up where Lefebvre will officiate, assisted
by 84-year-old Bishop Antonio de Castro Mayer of Brazil, the only
one among more than 2,000 Roman Catholic bishops who has sided
openly with Lefebvre.
   Several thousand followers, arriving by bus from France,
Switzerland and Germany, are expected to attend.
   The Bishop of Sion, Henri Schwery, whose diocese includes Econe,
has called for three days of special prayers for the ``unity of the
church'' beginning Tuesday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed without fanfare Monday
legislation strictly limiting the use of lie detector tests by
private employers.
   Reagan made no statement on the legislation, and his decision to
approve the bill was contained in a terse White House bill-signing
announcement.
   Congress had approved the legislation to protect job-seekers
from inappropriate use of polygraph exams by companies. The
congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated that as
many as 2 million such tests were administered in 1987, about 90
percent of them by private employers.
   The bill prohibits an employee from being discharged, dismissed,
disciplined, discriminated against or denied employment or
promotion solely on the basis of the test. To take action against
the worker, an employer has to have additional supporting evidence
under provisions of the bill that Reagan signed.
   The final version of the legislation approved by House-Senate
negotiators in May would prohibit most private-sector employers
from requiring their workers or job applicants to take lie detector
tests. Exceptions would be made for drug companies and those
providing security assistance.

   A strong earthquake jolted Northern
California on Monday, causing San Francisco skyscrapers to sway and
briefly halting commuter trains, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injury.
   The state Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento said the
quake hit 5.2 on the Richter scale, while the U.S. Geological
Survey office in Menlo Park said the quake registered 5.0.
   The epicenter, USGS spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said, was about 16
miles south of San Jose, along the San Andreas Fault. The time was
set at 11:43 a.m., she added.
   There were no indications of injury or damage, San Jose police
said.
   The quake was felt over a large area, extending from Santa Rosa,
about 60 miles north of San Francisco, to the Santa Cruz area 70
miles to the south.
   The temblor lasted up to 10 seconds in many areas. The 38 trains
running on Bay Area Rapid Transit lines were halted briefly to
allow a check for track damage and then allowed to resume operation.
   ``It hit real hard like something going into the side of the
building. Nothing fell, but light standards swayed back and
forth,'' said Tom Honig, city editor of the Santa Cruz Sentinel.
   Walt Glines, news editor of The Dispatch in Gilroy, said half
the workers in the newspaper's city room ``didn't even notice'' the
rolling quake, which he said seemed to hit that area in two waves.
   ``The first time, I thought it was a caffeine rush. But when the
second one hit, I knew,'' he said.
   A South San Francisco police dispatcher, who identified herself
only as Pat, said her department had received a few calls, but none
reporting damage.
   ``I sure felt it,'' she said. ``There were two shocks.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energey released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Each increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 times
greater.
   On Sunday, a moderate earthquake shook a wide area of Southern
California, but there were no reports of serious damage. At least
four people were treated for minor injuries.
   The temblor was felt in downtown Los Angeles and as far away as
Saugus, some 70 miles northwest of the epicenter, and Palm Springs,
about 70 miles to the east. It was followed by several aftershocks.
   The quake in Southern California, centered 3 miles
north-northwest of Upland, struck at 8:04 a.m. and registered 4.5
on the Richter scale, according to Robert Finn of the California
Institute of Technology Seismology Lab in Pasadena. Instruments at
the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., recorded a slightly
higher reading of 4.7.
   Upland, in San Bernardino County, is a city of about 50,000
people located 40 miles east of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Finger Pointed at Brezhnev Protege for Ethnic Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Politburo protege of the late Soviet
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev is partly to blame for grave ethnic
problems plaguing the southern republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia,
a Communist Party official said Monday.
   Vyacheslav A. Mikhailov, a party Central Committee specialist on
the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups, also said ethnic
Armenians are ignoring appeals to end a strike they began more than
a month ago.
   Mikhailov spoke at a news conference on how ethnic problems will
figure in the 19th Communist Party conference, a meeting of 5,000
delegates convening Tuesday in Moscow to review Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies.
   He said the demands of Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh to
take their region out of Azerbaijan and annex it to the Armenian
republic resulted from years of inattention to their cultural,
historical and social concerns. He singled out Geidar A. Aliev, a
Brezhnev protege who was party chief of Azerbaijan from 1969 to
1982, and his successor, Kyamran M. Bagirov.
   ``Those mistakes were made by the leadership of Azerbaijan both
by the party and govermental authorities, including the first
secretary of the republic Aliev and first secretary of Azerbaijan
Comrade Bagirov. Much damage has been done and really grave
damage,'' Mikhailov said.
   The criticism put Aliev even further into disgrace. He was
retired from the ruling Politburo on Oct. 21, 1987, ostensibly for
health reasons but under a cloud of poor performance in the
industries he oversaw. The previous blow was Thursday, when the
Azerbaijani party decided to turn a mansion Aliev had built for
Brezhnev in Baku, the republic's capital, into a wedding palace.
   Aliev, who headed the Azerbaijan KGB, was chosen a candidate
member of the Politburo in 1976 and was Brezhnev's last appointment
to full Politburo status in 1982. Although Brezhnev died before
Aliev's selection could be fully ratified, the new Soviet leader,
Yuri Andropov, could not overturn Brezhnev's decision, and Aliev
was made a member of the Politburo at the end of November, 1982,
according to Soviet historian Roy Medvedev.
   Bagirov also has lost his job. On May 21, he and Armenian party
chief Karen Demirchyan were retired, officially for health reasons
but most likely for mishandling the ethnic unrest.
   The Moscow government approved a package of housing and social
services improvements for Nagorno-Karabakh in March, but has yet to
review the annexation demand. Moscow party officials have already
rejected the demand.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began a strike and street
demonstrations May 23 to demand their region be taken out of
Azerbaijan. Residents voted at a public meeting in
Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, on Saturday to end the
strike, which has cost at least $50 million in economic losses,
Soviet media have reported. But Mikhailov said the walkout was
continuing.
   ``Today the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh launched a campaign
among the working people of the region so as to stop strikes and to
resume the normal rhythm of work and to resolve the problem. We
didn't have any definite results as a matter of fact through
today,'' he said.
   Telephone calls to Stepanakert did not go through Monday. An
operator said communications to the region were disrupted.
   The legislature of Armenia voted earlier this month to endorse
annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, but Azerbaijan's legislature
refused to give its consent.
   Mikhailov said a plenary meeting of the central party's 300-plus
member Central Committee would be held within a year to discuss the
problems of the Soviet Union's nationalities. Gorbachev has said
the problems are among the most severe facing the country.
   In another development, Mikhailov disclosed Monday that four
more Azerbaijanis had been convicted in the ethnic rioting in
February in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait. Thirty-two people, 26
Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were killed, and 200 people were
injured. Mikhailov did not say when the four had been convicted or
give the charges. Soviet officials have said more than 80 people
have been charged in the case.

   Police will use electric cattle prods,
tear gas guns and other anti-riot measures to control demonstrators
and ensure the safety of the Seoul Olympics, police and news
reports said Monday.
   Home Minister Lee Choon-ku, in charge of the country's
135,000-member police force, ordered an extensive crackdown on
criminals and political radicals before the Olympics, police said.
   The former army general urged riot troops to be ``aggressive and
offensive'' and arrest all violent demonstrators, police said.
   Newspapers said Lee is giving police permission to use electric
cattle prods, gas guns and riot clubs against demonstrators, in
addition to tear gas.
   Security has emerged as a major concern for the Olympics, which
run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent student protests
and labor unrest in recent months. So far this year, more than
960,000 people took part in about 4,300 mostly anti-government
demonstrations, up 80 percent from the same period last year.
   Some radical students, who have supported North Korea's demand
to be a co-host for the Games, have also staged demonstrations
against the Olympics.
   North Korea announced it will boycott the Olympics after South
Korea rejected its demand. North Korea charges that the Olympics in
Seoul would prolong the partition of the Korean peninsula.
   The two Koreas, divided since the end of World War II, are
bitter foes. The two nations fought the bloody Korean War from 1950
to 1953 after the North invaded the South.
   South Korea, the United States and other nations have expressed
concern that North Korea will try to disrupt the Olympics or that
international terrorist groups may stage attacks.
   Security officials from seven nations and 13 airlines will meet
this week to plan anti-terrorist measures for the Olympics, the
Foreign Ministry said today.
   The United States, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, and South Korea will attend the meeting, officials said.
Hong Kong, a British colony, also plans to send delegates.
   Thirteen airlines that fly to Seoul will also discuss ways to
ensure security for their aircraft during the Olympics, officials
said. The airlines were not identified.

<HEAD>EPA Says Lead Found in Water from Coolers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has found
tanks lined with lead solder in eight of 12 water coolers
manufactured by a company that said it had never used lead tanks or
lead-lined tanks, according to documents made available by a
congressional source.
   Water from one of the tanks was contaminated with lead 40 times
the current EPA drinking water standard _ and 100 times the
standard expected to be adopted later this year.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health and
environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, last week asked te company, Halsey Taylor of Freeport,
Ill., to recall the coolers to repair or replace the tanks.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, testing water coolers from
two Navy installations in Maryland, last year found high
concentrations of lead in their water.
   This discovery led to a survey of manufacturers by the
subcommittee, which estimated in February that close to a million
tanks had lead solder in their plumbing connections.
   Several models of Halsey Taylor coolers used lead solder on
connections between 1978 and late last year. But President Robert
A. Hoagland wrote Waxman in January that the company ``never
designed or manufactured a water cooler that used a ``lead-lined'
or lead tank.''
   Of 22 tanks provided by the Navy for testing, 12 were made by
Halsey Taylor and eight had tanks lined with lead solder, according
to a letter from Michael Cook, head of the water office at EPA, to
a company official.
   Halsey Taylor, a subsidiary of Household International Inc.,
inspected 14,000 coolers in 1979, repairing many with pinhole leaks
that had permitted solder to get inside.
   Cook said he did not know why solder would be used for a lining.
``It's conceivable'' the tanks had similar leaks, ``but it doesn't
look like it. The solder is in a uniform layer inside,'' Cook said.
   The solder is 50 percent lead and 50 percent other metals, he
said. EPA has offered to provide parts of the tank for the company
to test and is awaiting a response, he said.
   The company's director of marketing, Tom Klein, said he believed
Cook's assessment was wrong. The tanks in question probably came
from the 1979 batch and might easily have developed a uniform
coating inside, Klein said.
   ``We are not hiding our head in the sand; we are cooperating
with Congressman Waxman,'' said Klein.
   One of the tanks provided a sample containing 2,000 parts per
billion of lead, according to Cook's letter. The maximum
permissible lead concentration is 50 parts per billion and EPA
expects to lower that to 20 parts per billion.
   Two coolers with solder-lined tanks were missing identification
tags. The other six carried model numbers WT8A, GC10A and GC10ACR,
according to Cook's letter.
   Lead is a poison that, in high enough concentrations, can damage
the brain and other organs. Children are particularly vulnerable
because their brains are still developing.
   Until 1986 solder used on copper pipes in homes contained lead
and many older cities have lead pipes in their water systems.
   ``People should not be preoccupied with water coolers,'' said
Cook. In addition to all the other possible sources, he said, ``we
have increasing evidence that brass fittings in homes do contribute
lead in the very first water you get when turn on the tap after it
has been idle.''
   EPA has estimated that 42 million Americans use tap water
containing lead above 20 ppb, of which 3.8 million are children
under age 6. An estimated 241,000 children under 6 are getting
enough lead to harm them, the agency estimates.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., planned to introduce a bill today
requiring EPA to help schools test and renovate water systems
contaminated by lead, forbidding the sale of lead-containing
coolers and requiring manufacturers to recall any previously sold,
and forcing EPA to make the new standard 10 ppb instead of 20 ppb.
   The Water Test Corp. of Manchester, N.H. wrote Waxman it would
test samples without charge for schools that request it. Schools
would have to get sample bottles from the company and pay shipping
charges.

   Some colleges in California are handing
out small pledge cards along with diplomas asking graduates to
consider the ethical implications of their careers.
   At Humboldt State University Andrea Pickart picked up her degree
but politely declined the card and walked on.
   Her boyfriend, Peter Jain, also graduated at the May 14
ceremony. He signed the ``Graduation Pledge of Environmental and
Social Responsibility'' as soon as he got it.
   No one wants to go on record against ethical behavior, but
detractors feel the cards are unnecessary or an invasion of the
tradition of graduation.
   ``Politically and philosophically, I feel the pledges are
responsible. But I didn't feel any need to sign it. My own
convictions are strong enough to ensure that my employment is
socially and politically responsible,'' said Pickart, who holds a
master's degree in biology, works for a nature group and is a
member of 10 environmental groups.
   But Jain, who received a bachelor's degree in music, says he
looked at the pledge as an ``acknowledgement of the greater
consideration of the work you are doing.''
   Signing the card, the graduate pledges to ``thoroughly
investigate and take into account the social and environmental
consequences of any job opportunity I consider.''
   The pledges were included in this year's graduation ceremonies
at seven West Coast colleges and universities, including Humboldt
State, University of California-Santa Cruz and Stanford, where
President Donald Kennedy praised the pledge as something that
``should be as acceptable to the politically conservative as to the
liberal.''
   Some graduates have signed them publicly, others have taken them
home for further consideration and at least one has torn his up in
protest.
   ``A reality of the world is that literally every single action
that we take has consequenses on the world around us, not just on
ourselves,'' said Matt Nicodemus, a self-described ``full-time
peace activist'' who helped start the movement at Humboldt State
last year.
   ``We're asking people to look closely at as many of the
consequenses as they can identify and look at personal values. Once
you've found those, use them as your ethical and political
yardstick.''
   ``We want them to know it is possible to investigate the
consequences,'' he added. ``In the past, that has not been the
norm. We're saying we think it would be a good idea if that became
the norm.''
   Some opponents say the pledge is coercive. Others believe
including the pledge in graduation ceremonies erodes tradition.
   The most vocal opponent at Humboldt is recent graduate David
Lofink. As a student government representative last semester, he
vowed to tear up the pledge during the ceremony.
   ``I think I hugged my mother first, and then I tore it up,''
Lofink said.
   He said he's concerned the university will have difficulty
turning down similar requests from other groups.
   ``When does it stop? Once you've let one group come in with
their idea on a pledge, when do you say no?'' he said. ``Most
students are indifferent. My philosophy is that most want to get
through college, out the door and on to a job.''

<HEAD>Anti-Khomeini Marchers Cite Recent Military Victories in Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 opponents of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini staged a rally and march Monday to mark the
seventh anniversary of their group's expulsion from Iran and to
celebrate a recent military victory along the Iran-Iraq border.
   Two members of Congress addressed the noisy rally across the
street from the White House, terming the People's Mujahedeen of
Iran a legitimate exiled opposition movement and comparing them to
``freedom fighters'' the United States supports elsewhere in the
world.
   ``There is no question in my mind yours is a just cause,'' said
Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., a member of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee. Dymally said he is trying to build diplomatic
and political support for the group, which is conducting its own
war against the Khomeini regime.
   A crowd that police estimated at 2,700 held neatly printed
banners condemning Khomeini and bearing photos of the resistance
movement's leaders, Massoud and Maryam Rajavi.
   Rep. Donald Lukens, R-Ohio, also spoke to the group, and told a
reporter he sees the organization as a force to establish democracy
in Iran. He said he had not even heard of the group until six
months ago, but had since become persuaded of its legitimacy.
   The United States is officially neutral in the eight-year war
between Iran and Iraq, and in the past has labeled the Mujahedeen a
terrorist organization. That criticism has been moderated in recent
months, however, and there have been staff-level contacts between
the State Department and the opposition group.
   At a press briefing before the rally, the group's international
affairs secretary, Moshen Reza'i, said the capture last week of the
Iranian city of Mehran by anti-Khomeini troops marked ``a military,
political and social turning point'' in its struggle.
   He said the group's National Liberation Army of Iran had
inflicted 8,000 casualties in four days of fighting, taken 1,500
prisoners and seized or destroyed $2 billion in weapons. Reza'i
said rebel troops had taken 44 tanks and some U.S.-made anti-tank
and anti-aircraft missiles.
   The town of Mehran itself has little strategic value and
virtually no civilian population, and was only lightly defended by
Khomeini's troops. But the victory was seen as having political
significance as one in a string of recent defeats for the Iranian
regime.
   Reza'i denied that his organization is funded by Iraq, saying
Iraq provides only sanctuary for the rebels along their border with
Iran. He declined to say how many rebel troops are under arms.
Press reports have put the group's strength at about 10,000.
   He said the group was not seeking military backing from the
United States, but was pressing for adoption of a broad embargo on
purchase of Iranian oil and an international embargo on weapons
sales to Iran.

<HEAD>Mexico Releases From Prison Man Wanted in U.S.</HEAD>

   A Puerto Rican separatist who is wanted in
the United States for terrorist activities has been released from
prison and sent to Cuba, the Mexican government said Monday.
   William Morales was flown to Cuba on Friday after completing
five years of his eight-year sentence, said Interior Department
spokesman Octavio Campos.
   The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said the U.S. government was
``outraged and surprised by reports that Mexican authorities may
have released William Morales, whom we understand had several years
left to serve on Mexican homicide and attempted murder charges.''
   The statement from Campos, which did not provide further
details, was the first confirmation of Morales' whereabouts since
reports surfaced this weekend that Morales, 37, had been released
from prison.
   Reports in the leftist newspapers La Jornada and Uno mas Uno,
which have been following the Morales case closely, said Morales
was released from prison Friday and turned over to the custody of
federal Interior Department immigration agents.
   The United States wanted him extradited to serve out a prison
sentence on weapons and explosives charges. But Mexico decided
earlier this month that his was a political case not covered by the
extradition treaty prevailing between the two nations.
   ``The United States would be deeply disturbed that an individual
with Morales' record of criminal behavior, a convicted felon in
both countries, should even be considered for possible political
refugee status,'' the U.S. Embassy statement said.
   ``The U.S. government already expressed our displeasure to the
government of Mexico over the Foreign Ministry's decision not to
extradite Morales to the United States,'' it said. ``Allowing him
to go free would be a serious blow to international efforts to
combat terrorism and an affront to U.S.-Mexican relations.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Morales was
implicated in a 1975 bombing in New York in which four people were
killed and 60 injured and has been sentenced to over 100 years in
prison in the United States on weapons possession charges.
   Morales was arrested in New York in 1978 after a bomb he was
making detonated, blowing off most of both hands and disfiguring
his face. He escaped from U.S. custody a year later.
   U.S. officials say Morales is a leader of the Puerto Rican
independence group, the Armed Forces of National Liberation, or
FALN.
   Morales escaped from the prison ward of Bellevue Hospital in New
York City a month after he was sentenced to a 29- to 89-year prison
term on state charges and up to 10 years in prison on federal
charges.
   He made his way to Mexico, where he was taken into custody in
1983. He was sentenced for his role in the death of one policeman
and the wounding of another on May 26, 1983, near the central city
of Puebla and for entering Mexico illegally.
   The Foreign Ministry's decision granting him political asylum
was announced earlier in June.
   Morales said in an interview with The Associated Press from
prison at that time that the decision was ``a political recognition
of our fight'' for independence.
   La Jornada's original report on the Mexican government decision
quoted a resolution signed by Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda
as concluding that Morales ``did not arrive at producing harm to
society or any individuals in particular, except those he inflicted
upon himself.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed the report.

   About 400 construction volunteers, led in a
rousing hymn by Mayor Andrew Young, began work Monday to build 20
homes in five days for working but poor families.
   The effort by the non-profit Habitat for Humanity, an ecumenical
Christian organization, is named the ``Jimmy Carter Work Project''
in honor of the former president, a former Habitat board member who
will join the workers for the final three days. It is the group's
largest project yet.
   Young, also a Congregationist minister, proclaimed it ``Habitat
for Humanity Week'' and led the crew in an impromptu rendition of
``When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder.''
   ``You bring with you the spirit and love of God, and a concern
for `the least of these' _ God's children,'' Young told the
workers. ``We are willing to combine our service and our cash in
the service of Christ.''
   The three-bedroom, one-bath houses being constructed in the
Edgewood neighborhood will be sold at no profit, with no interest,
to 20 working families with children. Mortgage payments will
average about $175 a month, including taxes and insurance.
   The new neighborhood is being built on a block of land in
southeast Atlanta donated by the city. Supporting the 400-odd
construction workers are another 800 volunteers handling a variety
of chores.
   Plans call for 30 more houses to be built in the Cabbagetown
neighborhood by 1989 and 25 more homes by 1990 in another
neighborhood. Habitat for Humanity is working to raise $1.5 million
for the first 50 homes in the Atlanta project.
   Young recalled that he and his wife, Jean, were able to buy a
home of their own years ago, when he worked on a small salary at
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and she earned even
less as a teacher.
   ``Now ... it's almost impossible to afford the home, the
financing and the interest,'' he said, adding that ``never before
in the history of this country have we had such a crisis in
housing.''
   But through Habitat for Humanity, ``we can have homes with no
profit, and no interest,'' Young said.
   The effort is ``real rewarding work,'' said project director
Bruce Gunter, an Atlanta investments counselor and veteran Habitat
volunteer. ``This is such a motivational bunch of folks.''
   About one-third of this week's workers are in the construction
business themselves, Gunter said. ``Another third are moderately
skilled, and the other third don't know one end of the hammer from
the other.
   ``But there's work for everybody; you need some people to tote
things, too,'' he said.
   Also on Monday, Habitat for Humanity supporters began a
1,200-mile walk from Portland, Maine, to Georgia. Along the way,
they plan to build 120 homes for needy families.
   Sunday in Macon, about 200 people walked a mile in 100-degree
heat to the first house built by Habitat in that central Georgia
city.
   Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by Millard Fuller, a
millionaire businessman who, in the late 1960s, gave away his
fortune and began working to house the poor.
   Carter served on Habitat's board from 1984-87 and continues to
work with the organization.

<HEAD>AMA Proposes Massive $24 Billion Medicaid Overhaul</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by the American Medical Association to
expand the government's Medicaid health insurance program to cover
27 million more poor people is laudable but may be unaffordable,
says one official.
   The report issued at the AMA's policy-making convention
recommends that Medicaid be expanded to cover 27 million more poor
people. The federal-state program now serves about 19 million poor,
elderly, blind and disabled.
   Members of the AMA's House of Delegates are expected to act on
the report during the convention, which runs Monday through
Thursday.
   ``The Medicaid program is totally inadequate to address the
problem of uninsured and underinsured people in the United
States,'' said Dr. William Hotchkiss, outgoing AMA president. ``As
physicians, we feel we must take the position of advocates for
making health care available to all low-income people.''
   The report proposes a massive overhaul of the Medicaid program
at an estimated annual cost of $24 billion. It calls for expanding
Medicaid to provide coverage for medical care to an estimated 27
million people who are living at or below the poverty level but not
receiving government health-care benefits.
   At 1988 spending levels, the AMA's proposal would raise
Medicaid's cost from $52 billion to $76 billion, but it doesn't
recommend how to pay for the increase.
   ``I think it's a laudable attempt by the AMA to address the
issue of how we provide medical care to the poor and working poor
of our country,'' said Dean Schott, a spokesman for the Illinois
Department of Public Aid, which administers the program in this
state.
   ``But the AMA, I think, has an obligation to also suggest how
this program would be funded. Do we raise taxes to pay for it? Do
we shift money from one program to another?'' Schott said Sunday.
   The AMA study found that an estimated 60 percent of U.S.
residents whose incomes are below the national poverty level don't
qualify for Medicaid because the eligibility standards vary widely
between states.
   To reduce these inequities, the AMA proposes creating uniform
national standards of eligibility and uniform payments for medical
care.
   When the federal goverment established Medicaid in 1965 it
failed to set uniform standards and any changes in the program
would require its approval.
   Without national standards, the program has evolved into a
``patchwork quilt'' with a wide variation in benefits among the
states, said Dr. Robert McAfee, an AMA trustee and a surgeon from
Portland, Maine.
   To qualify for Medicaid in 1986, for example, a family of three
who received welfare could have an income of no more than $1,416 in
Alabama, but in Alaksa the maximum income is $8,800, the AMA report
said.

<TEXT>
   About 400 Vietnamese troops
left central Cambodia on Monday as part of what Vietnam says will
be its largest troop withdrawal since it invaded Cambodia nearly a
decade ago.
   The Vietnamese troops boarded trucks and headed south from
Kompong Chhnang toward the capital, Phnom Pehn, local officials
said.
   The officials said the pullout left only 200 Vietnamese soldiers
in Kompong Chhnang, a central province away from the main
battlefields along Cambodia's border with Thailand. They said the
remaining troops would leave Oct. 25.
   Vietnam announced in May it would withdraw 50,000 troops from
neighboring Cambodia by the end of the year, beginning in June. It
also said all of its estimated 120,000 troops would be gone by
1990, leaving the fighting to the forces of the Phnom Penh
government it installed after the 1978 invasion.
   The Vietnamese have been fighting a coalition of guerrilla
forces in Cambodia that includes the communist Khmer Rouge, the
non-communist Khmer People's Party and followers of former leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Vietnamese authorities have said they plan to fly their entire
military command in Cambodia from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, on Thursday.
   Chhim Thoeun, vice chairman of the Kompong Chhnang provincial
party committee, told The Associated Press on Monday that all
Vietnamese social, economic and military experts also would leave
Cambodia by the end of year.
   ``The people in the remote villages are not happy with the
(Vietnamese) withdrawal'' because they fear the Khmer Rouge might
return to power, Chhim said. The Khmer Rouge murdered hundreds of
thousands of people during the bloody 1975-78 reign of Pol Pot.
   Chhim said 132,000 people were killed in Kompong Chhnang
province alone under the Khmer Rouge, and another 300,000 were
reported missing.
   Mok Vanny, chief of the Cabinet of the provincial Peoples
Committe, the local government, noted that ``from 1979 up until
now, the provincial town has never been touched by an enemy
attack.''

   A neurologist who has seen her Soviet
refuesnik husband just once in eight years says she always knew
they eventually would be reunited.
   Dr. Galina Vileshina and her husband, Pyatras Pakenas, were to
meet Tuesday in Washington, D.C., as he steps off the plane from
West Germany, said Ken Klein, an aide to U.S. Sen. Bob Graham.
   ``In my heart I've always been ready for him,'' Ms. Vileshina
said. ``In my heart I always knew he would come.''
   Pakenas' 18 requests for an exit visa were denied until May, but
he kept in touch with his wife through daily letters and weekly
telephone calls from Moscow.
   Ms. Vileshina, 52, last saw her husband during a 10-day visit to
Russia last year. She expressed concern about his high blood
pressure and said he needed better medical care.
   Pakenas, 55, left the Soviet Union on Friday, stopping in West
Germany. A Capitol Hill reception for the couple is scheduled
Wednesday.
   Ms. Vileshina enlisted the aid of politicans, human rights
activists, journalists and other ``divided couples'' in her
attempts to help her husband leave the Soviet Union. Her efforts
included meetings with President Reagan and Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   ``She really didn't give up, and it was tough on her,'' said
Orest Deychak of the Helsinki Commission in Washington, a group
that monitors human rights. ``Her level of commitment is
phenomenal. This case is a result of a lot of concentrated effort.''
   The couple originally applied to emigrate from the Soviet Union
10 years ago, but only Ms. Vileshina and their son were permitted
to leave in 1980. They lived in New York until 1985, when they
moved to Florida and became American citizens.

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old woman with a budding
journalism career has been found dead after less than two weeks at
her first job.
   Audrey Cardenas graduated May 13 and landed a summer internship
at the Belleville News-Democrat. But 11 days after her June 8
arrival, she was gone without a trace.
   Police sought clues in her disappearance. The newspaper that
hired her offered a reward. Her mother flew to southern Illinois to
help in the search.
   On Sunday, a Belleville East Township High School employee found
her body in a dry creek bed on school property.
   Police Detective Mike Boyne said Monday authorities have no
leads in the case, which was being treated as a homicide.
   Miss Cardenas's job as an editorial intern was her first since
her graduation from Texas A&M University.
   She was reported missing June 20 when she failed to show up for
work. Police searched her apartment, but found all her belongings,
minus a key ring, undisturbed. Her truck was still parked outside
her apartment.
   Friends and relatives said Miss Cardenas was a perfectionist who
didn't recognize the full extent of her talent.
   ``She struck me as a person who was good at what she did but
worried that she wasn't good enough,'' said Joe Ostermeier,
coordinator of the Capital Cities minority training program for the
News-Democrat. ``It's just sad to think about a life snuffed out
just at the start.''
   Her immediate goal was to be a good reporter and she had the
talent, attitude and dedication to become one, said Doug Starr,
head of the Texas A&M journalism department.
   Miss Cardenas was a quiet but popular student who worked hard to
maintain her B grades and ran on the university's cross-country
team, said her aunt, Patsy Perry of College Station, Texas.
   ``Everything she tried to do or wanted to do, she excelled at
it,'' Ms. Perry said. ``She put herself down too much. She just
needed more self-confidence.
   ``She was so shy that most of the time we found out she had run
a (cross-country) race from the paper.''
   A sports enthusiast, Miss Cardenas set her time around jogging
and Boston Celtics basketball games, Ms. Perry said. ``If the
Celtics were playing, you could always catch her at home, but you
wouldn't dare call her.''
   Police Chief Robert Hurst said the cause of death was not
immediately determined because of the body's decomposition. An
autopsy was planned, he added.

   Right-wing Cabinet Minister
Ariel Sharon demanded Monday that Palestinian firebombers be
``eliminated'' and Arabs involved in violent anti-Israeli protests
be deported.
   Sharon, the Trade and Industry minister, toured this Jewish
settlement to inaugurate four industrial plants. Ariel, with a
population of 8,000, is about 19 miles north of Jerusalem.
   Sharon has been leading a chorus of political hardliners and
Jewish settlers who insist on tougher army action to quell the
6-month-old Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``A terrorist should be eliminated. People throwing Molotov
cocktails (firebombs) should be eliminated. People who are involved
in violence should be expelled from the country,'' said Sharon, a
former defense minister who engineered Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon.
   He would not elaborate when asked what he meant by
``eliminated.''
   Sharon and others have repeatedly denounced Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and stepped up their criticism last week after an
Israeli farmer was bludgeoned to death and a Jewish settler
stabbed. Both attacks were blamed on Arabs.
   Sharon told reporters in Ariel on Monday that Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir must ``instruct the defense minister to impose law
and order immediately. And if the prime minister is not successful
... there are always means to solve it. To replace him (Rabin) is a
possibility.''
   Sharon, a member of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, also
criticized the left-leaning Labor Party, whose leaders have said
only a political settlement can end the uprising during which 211
Palestinians and four Israelis have died. Rabin is a Labor member.
   ``The root of evil is that some in the political establishment
are constantly trying to explain that the solution can only be
political,'' Sharon said. ``This just prevents the forces (the
army) from taking all the necessary steps.''

   NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman''
returns to the air Tuesday night with the first new shows since the
strike by the Writers Guild of America forced the popular talk show
into reruns three months ago.
   As of Monday, Letterman was expecting to come back without his
writers, though the show's producers were still trying to work out
a guild waiver that would allow the writing staff to work, too.
   ``Late Night'' head writer Steve O'Donnell stressed last week
that whether or not they were at work, Letterman was going on the
air with the writers' blessings and in no way was trying to
disadvantage the guild, of which Letterman is himself a member.
   ``We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the best
thing is to get the show on the air,'' O'Donnell said.
   Johnny Carson, host of NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' returned to the
air last month with Carson writing his own monologue.
   Letterman is not violating the strike as long as he writes his
own material, which he will do if his writers aren't allowed back
to work. Guests confirmed for Tuesday night's show include Billy
Crystal, Susan Sarandon, Graham Parker and Los Angeles Lakers coach
Pat Reilly.

<HEAD>House Extends Asbestos Cleanup Deadline For Some Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday approved legislation to
grant some school districts a deadline extension for drawing up
plans to get deadly asbestos out of their school buildings.
   The bill was sent by voice vote to the Senate, where a similar
proposal is pending.
   Under a 1986 law, school districts have until next Oct. 12 to
survey their facilities for the presence of friable, or crumbling,
asbestos and to draft plans to get the cancer-causing material
safely removed or stabilized.
   The House bill would allow a governor to extend this deadline to
May 9, 1989. The legislation would not change the July 9, 1989,
date by which the 1986 law requires school districts to begin
implementing their plans.
   Congress is in the process of allowing case-by-case deadline
extensions because school officials around the country have
complained that a shortage of trained personnel and money are
hampering the drafting of plans.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that as many
as 30,000 schools may contain dangerous asbestos, whose fibers have
been proven to cause lung cancer and other respiratory ailments.

<HEAD>Court to Hear Appeal in California Roadblock Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an
appeal by the family of a man killed when the allegedly stolen car
he was driving smashed into a police roadblock.
   The court said it will decide in the case from California
whether the roadblock _ a tractor-trailer placed at night in the
middle of a highway _ may have been an unreasonably dangerous means
of apprehending the driver.
   William James Caldwell was chased by Inyo County, Calif.,
sheriff's deputies for 25 miles on the night of Oct. 23, 1984. The
sheriff's office believed Caldwell was driving a stolen car.
   At one point during the pursuit, a deputy radioed ahead to set
up a roadblock. A tractor-trailer owned by Missouri-Nebraska
Express and driven by James M. Holmgren was placed by the deputies
in the middle of Route 395, blocking both lanes of the highway.
   Also, a sheriff's car was positioned in front of the
tractor-trailer with its headlights directed at the oncoming car
driven by Caldwell.
   Caldwell slammed into the rig and died shortly after the
collision.
   His mother, Georgia Brower, and his fiancee, Renee King, sued
the county and its sheriff's office on behalf of themselves and
Scott Daniel King, the son of Ms. King and Caldwell who will be 3
years old next week.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ordered further
lower hearings to determine whether the sheriff's office violated
Caldwell's due process rights protected by the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution.
   But the appeals court threw out the claim that Caldwell was
``seized'' unlawfully in violation of rights under the 4th
Amendment.
   Caldwell's mother and fiancee are seeking to reinstate the 4th
Amendment claim in their suit against the county, its sheriff's
department and the sheriff's deputies who set up the roadblock.
   The case is Brower vs. Inyo County, 87-248.

   Attorneys for convicted Colombian drug
kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas have asked a federal judge to delay his
sentencing for six weeks and move him closer to Miami.
   In a motion filed Monday seeking the delay, attorneys wrote that
Lehder, 37, has been at the nation's toughest federal prison in
Marion, Ill. They claim they have been unable to prepare for
sentencing because of their inability to privately or easily
consult with their client there.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton, who scheduled sentencing
for July 20, has not ruled on the motion to delay. Lehder faces a
maximum of life plus 150 years in prison for his conviction May 19
on 11 cocaine-smuggling counts.
   The attorneys asked that until sentencing that Lehder be moved
to prison in Miami or Tallahassee.
   Attorneys Edward R. Shohat and Jose Quinon, also wrote that
Lehder should not be housed at Marion.
   ``Carlos Lehder does not have the type of record which would
justify his incarceration at Marion, Illinois. He does not have a
serious record of institutional misconduct, or for that matter of
any sort of misconduct,'' said the motion.
   The attorneys said he had not been involved in any violence or
escape attempts and does not yet face a long sentence.
   Shohat also filed a separate motion seeking a delay because he
will be in Venezuela, South America, involved in taking depositions
in another drug case where he is the defense counsel.

   The son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin
said Monday he would run for a parliament seat with the right-wing
Herut Party that his father founded.
   Benjamin Zeev Begin, 44, not only looks like his father but he
has some of the older politician's fiery oratorical style.
   He has teased his supporters by refusing to confirm his
candidacy until just days before Herut's 1,000 Central Committee
members meet Wednesday to choose their candidates for the national
elections in November.
   Begin's announcement signaled a long anticipated move into
politics that party leaders hope will attract new voters to the
Herut Party, a senior partner in the ruling Likud coalition.
   The older Begin, 74, founder of the Herut Party and a survivor
of the Nazi Holocaust, has lived a reclusive existence in Jerusalem
since stepping down from the premiership in 1983.
   Party officials say the younger Begin _ known as ``Benny'' _
should boost prospects for Herut.
   The prospective candidate said he doesn't expect automatic
support at Wednesday's party convention.
   ``I'm not counting on anything, I have a lot of (lobbying) work
to do,'' Begin, a geologist by profession, told Army radio.
   But Herut legislators and other party leaders believe the
bespectacled Begin will be a shoe-in.
   Yossi Ahimeir, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said he
expects Begin will also attract votes for the Likud, which faces a
close contest with the left-leaning Labor Party in November.
   ``He is a man who can attract votes, maybe even help gain us an
extra seat,'' Ahimeir told The Associated Press.
   A public opinion poll published Friday in the Yediot Ahronot
daily showed Labor with a slight edge over Likud.
   The poll gave Labor 42 out of 120 seats in the Knesset and Likud
only 40, while the remaining seats would be divided among several
smaller parties.
   Like his father, Benny Begin is a hawk and objects to
relinquishing the Israeli-occupied territories to the Palestinians.
The Herut Party considers the West Bank and Gaza Strip to be
inextricably linked to the history of Israel. Begin, a researcher
at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, gradually entered politics over
the past two years by giving interviews and appearing at party
meetings.
   He told the Hadashot daily he weighed his options carefully
before deciding to enter politics and also indicated he had
consulted closely with his father.
   Menachem Begin has never explained why he quit his job five
years ago. Aides say the older Begin was melancholy over Israel's
heavy casualties following his government's decision to invade
Lebanon in 1982, and depressed about the death of his wife, Aliza,
the same year.

   Two hand grenades exploded in a crowded
bar, killing two people and injuring 37, officials said Monday.
   The blast ripped through a disco club early Sunday morning near
the town of Masaka, 83 miles south of the Ugandan capital of
Kampala.
   Earlier, six soldiers from nearby barracks stormed into the
Kijjabwemi bar and harassed customers, according to District
Commissioner Capt. Livingstone Katelegga.
   He said three suspects were arrested Sunday but refused to say
whether they were civilians or soldiers.

   The boat wrecks found on sandbars
exposed by the drought-shrunken Mississippi River are probably just
the first of many that will appear, an archaeolgist says.
   Archaeologists will be deciding in the coming weeks which of the
steamboats should be reclaimed.
   ``One thing we have to keep in mind in evaluating these wrecks
and how much we should spend on them (is that) I expect others to
appear all up and down the Mississippi,'' said Skip
Stewart-Abernathy of the Arkansas Archaeological Survey, who is
investigating the remains of several boats found last week at West
Memphis.
   ``Once we have a feel for how much we've got ... then we can
decide how to use scarce resources,'' he said Sunday.
   Last week, the wreckage of five or six craft were found,
including one that is certainly a steamboat and one that may be a
steamboat, while the rest are probably barges, he said.
   ``All of these are wooden vessels dating from about 1880 to
about 1910, 1920,'' he said. ``The definite steamboat has been
ripped around. It may have come ashore unhappy. There's a lot of
firebricks and reinforcing rod and some odd pieces of engine things
that confirm that it was a steamboat, the sidewheeler kind.
   One wreck is in good shape. ``It's 140 feet by 30 feet wide, and
it was probably a steamboat and probably a sidewheeler, but it has
been heavily salvaged not long after it was lost.''
   The wreck that has been positively identified as a steamboat
probably dates from before 1900, Stewart-Abernathy said, because
there is no sign that round, wire nails _ which came into use about
the turn of the century _ were used in its manufacture. The other
wreck identified as a probable steamboat, he said, has both round
nails and square nails, indicating that some work was done on it
after 1900.
   ``That boat had an interesting history,'' he said. ``It looks to
have been badly damaged, perhaps in a fire, and there was a lot of
rebuilding done on the deck; it's that rebuilding that used the
modern nails.''
   None of the wrecks has been identified, Stewart-Abernathy said.
   ``I took more than 160 pictures, and that was just a start. We
want to come away with enough information to put together
blueprints,'' he said.
   That involves money, he said, and ``we need to explore avenues
for that. Within a couple of weeks, we should have an idea of how
these wrecks relate to other wrecks in the Mississippi valley, and
decide what else ought to be done.''

   East German border guards fired
shots at a tractor that was ramming into barriers marking the
border with the West, police said Monday.
   Border police in Munich said the incident took place Sunday
night near the West German town of Ludwigstadt, about 95 miles
north of Nuremberg.
   Western patrol guards heard several rounds of shots fired about
9:45 p.m. on the other side of the border, police said.
   The guards later noticed that an electronic fence and a steel
mesh fence about 200 yards inside East German territory had been
smashed, police said. The tractor was stuck in a moat between two
mesh fences, about 15 meters from West German territory, police
said.
   Police said they did not know how many people were in the
vehicle.

   Four Filipino sailors died Monday when
they fell into a ship's cargo hold filled with soybeans, the
government and Red Cross officials said.
   The Greek captain of the Sea Bony, Haliabalia Zafiros, was
treated for poisoning after breathing toxic fumes from the hold,
filled with 170,000 pounds of fermenting Brazilian soybeans,
according to Red Cross spokesman Miguel Ramos.
   Rescue workers pulled the bodies of two sailors from the hold of
the ship after responding to a call for help from the vessel, Ramos
said.
   He said one of the men apparently suffocated in the hold, while
the other died from injuries suffered in the fall.
   Two other crew members died en route to Barcelona's Principes de
Espana hospital, a doctor said.

<HEAD>Report: Tougher Regulations Needed On Oil Spills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The massive fuel spill in the Ohio River last
January demonstrated the need for stiffer regulations to guard
against such accidents, a congressional report said Monday.
   The Congressional Research Service said in a 21-page analysis
that Ashland Oil Inc. complied with federal standards in assuming
responsibility for the difficult cleanup of more than 700,000
gallons of diesel fuel from a terminal near Pittsburgh on Jan. 2.
   The problem, CRS said, appears to lie in loosely-written
regulations that make it difficult for the Environmental Protection
Agency to detect problems before they occur. The research agency
noted that it was only after the collapse of an Ashland tank that
EPA found faults with the company's spill prevention plan.
   The fuel-tank collapse at Ashland's Floreffe Terminal caused the
contamination of drinking water in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and
Ohio. The rupture stemmed from a dime-sized flaw in the tank's
nearly 50-year-old steel wall.
   Ashland and other owners of above-ground oil tanks holding more
than 660 gallons are required to file oil spill prevention plans
which must be reviewed every three years. Ashland's plan was on
file near Pittsburgh, as required.
   But the government did not learn about alleged flaws in the plan
until after the accident. EPA said in a memorandum on Jan. 15 that
Ashland's Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures plan ``does
not adequately address spill prevention and control specific to the
facility.''
   ``Instead,'' the EPA said, ``it merely paraphrases the SPCC
regulations.''
   But Monday's report said the EPA never saw the plan before the
accident because regulations only require that the document be
prepared, not that it be inspected by EPA.
   Under the regulations, EPA only gets involved after spills have
occurred, unless it has reason to suspect problems.
   ``Minor spills should not be the only reason for an SPCC plan to
come before federal and state officials,'' CRS said in the report.
``More automatic review by EPA and state officials might be
desired, and perhaps the regulations should state this.''
   CRS also said Congress should consider harsher penalties for
companies that fail to comply with spill prevention regulations.
   The regulations now call for penalties of $5,000 for each day
the violation continues. ``This could be construed as to have very
limited application, perhaps technical violations of only one or
two days duration,'' CRS said.
   The EPA has been reviewing whether problems with Ashland's spill
prevention plan merit penalties.
   Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum said Monday that company believes
the plan met EPA regulations.
   ``We have not been fined and it's been our contention that we
had an adequate plan,'' he said.
   The CRS report was requested by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
The senator said he was ``committed to pursuing legislation drawing
from CRS recommendations to prevent future spills.''

<HEAD>Steady Gain in Chinese Grain Output Seen by Next Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's grain production may increase by as
much as 25 percent to around 500 million metric tons by the year
2000 from an average of 394 million tons in the 1980s, an
Agriculture Department report said Monday.
   ``Area sown to grain probably will decrease over the next 12
years, but improved yields could boost total output,'' the report
said. ``However, per capita consumption probably will rise slowly,
as gains in output may be offset by increases in population and
(livestock) feed use.''
   Although small amounts of corn and other so-called coarse grains
are likely to be exported by efficient producers in the Northeast
and rice producers in the South, China is expected to remain a net
grain importer.
   ``Costal urban areas will import sizable quantities of wheat for
human consumption and limited quantities of feed grains,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   U.S. agricultural exports to China in the fiscal year that began
last Oct. 1 could exceed $400 million in value, about double the
$211 million of 1986-87, the report said. A number of subsized
sales of U.S. wheat have helped account for the increase.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Tackles Pension Tax Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether states may tax federal pensions while exempting the
pensions of retired state workers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by a Michigan man seeking
a $4,299 refund from the state.
   Paul S. Davis of East Lansing is seeking the refund for state
taxes he paid from 1979 through 1984. Davis, a lawyer, worked for
the federal government at various times in his career, retiring in
1980.
   Michigan law allows federal retirees living in the state to
deduct up to $7,500 in their annual government pensions when
computing what they owe in state taxes.
   The law permits retired state workers to deduct all of their
state pensions from their state taxes.
   The Michigan Court of Appeals in 1987 upheld the statute. It
said the state law does not violate a federal law in which Congress
allowed states to tax federal ``pay or compensation ... if the
taxation does not discriminate'' against federal workers.
   The state court also said the different treatment in pensions is
justified by Michigan's legitimate policy of recruiting and keeping
state employees.
   The Reagan administration supported Davis' appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   The Justice Department said, ``The fact that the discrimination
at issue here gives the state a competitive edge does not
distinguish it from any other special tax benefit given to those
who deal with the state rather than the federal government and does
not justify the discrimination.''
   The case is Davis vs. Michigan Department of Treasury, 87-1020.

<HEAD>Solar Flare Effects Less Than Originally Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major magnetic storm that would have
disrupted radio communications did not occur Monday, fulfilling a
revised forecast that scientists issued in the wake of the largest
solar flare in four years.
   ``It has not caused any problems that we are aware of,'' said
Michael Abbott, a forecaster at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Space Environmental Laboratory in
Boulder.
   On Friday, after a nearly two-hour flare, forecasters predicted
a storm that would cause major disruptions to short-wave, including
shore-to-shore communications, polar communications and contact
between airliners and ground controllers, as well as long-distance
telephone calls.
   But they downgraded that original forecast Saturday, and amended
it again Sunday.
   Gary Heckman, NOAA's space environment services chief, had said
when the storm warning was issued Friday that forecasting such
disturbances was tricky.
   Hot gases and electrically charged particles emitted by solar
flares contain their own magnetic field, which must be ``pointed in
the right direction to interact with Earth's magnetic field'' to
cause a magnetic storm, Heckman said.
   Abbott said the region on the sun that caused the large flares
has begun rotating away from the Earth. ``We don't expect any more
significant activity from this region,'' he said.
   But he said another region that will be pointed toward the Earth
for the next 14 days could produce some activity.
   NOAA officials in Boulder predicted the serious storm Friday
after the largest solar flare in four years exploded on the sun.
   Friday's solar flare _ an explosive release of hot gas,
electrically charged particles and X-rays _ began at 10:44 a.m. MDT
and lasted for nearly two hours, scientists said.
   Dale Gary, a solar astronomer at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, said it was the biggest flare since April
1984, with its visible portion extending perhaps 200,000 miles
above the sun's surface.

   Two suburban trains collided at a Paris train
station today, killing at least four people, injuring 40, and
leaving an unknown number trapped inside the two trains, police
said.
   Earlier, unofficial reports put the number of dead at 15.
Although the official toll was lower, police said the number of
dead was expected to rise as workers pulled more bodies from the
wreckage.
   Cars were buckled from the violent impact of the accident.
   As many as five people were seriously injured in the accident,
according to rescue workers.
   The collision occurred shortly after 7 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) on the
Gare de Lyon station's underground level, said fire officials
handling rescue efforts.
   The oncoming train entering the underground level of the
station, on the Right Bank of the Seine River in eastern Paris,
crashed into the rear of another train about to leave, according to
witnesses.
   The engine of one train was mounted on the rail cars at the end
of the other. The front of the oncoming train was gaping opon.
   Details of the accident were not immediately clear.
   Rescue workers set up an emergency station in the station. Its
underground section was sealed off while the operation continued.
   Transport Minister Louis Mermaz went to the scene of the
accident.
   Other details about the accident were not immediately available.

   The summer drought will put more hamburger
into school cafeterias next fall when children return to class,
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Monday.
   An additional $50 million was authorized to buy surplus ground
beef for donation to schools and other institutions. Officials
estimated the money will buy about $45 million of bulk frozen
ground beef, in addition to the regularly scheduled purchases.
   In 1986-87, USDA spent $113 million for 115 million pounds of
frozen ground beef for donation to schools.
   Drought has reduced forage supplies and has forced more cows
onto the market, depressing prices. According to department
figures, Utility-grade cows sold for $50 per 100 pounds of live
weight in May, and by mid-June were bringing $37.50.

   Farmers in 1,502 counties designated for
drought aid will be allowed to cut hay on conservation land and
sell it to others, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Monday.
   Regulations earlier permitted farmers only to receive harvesting
expenses if hay was sold. Lyng said the rules were changed to
``provide incentives to producers'' to increase hay supplies in
drought-stricken areas.
   A related action will allow producers in the eligible counties
to use consevation acreage to be green-chopped for immediate
feeding to livestock or for silage. This is in addition to
harvesting for hay.
   More information on these and other changes in the use of
conservation land for livestock forage can be obtained at local

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James Blanchard signed into law
Monday a ban on pregnancy for pay, making Michigan the first state
to establish surrogate parenting as a crime.
   Brokers who arrange surrogate-parent contracts in Michigan will
be subject to felony penalties of up to five years in jail and a
$50,000 fine under the statute, effective Sept. 1. Those who
contract for a birth or agree to bear a child for money will risk
misdemeanor penalties of up to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   Blanchard said he was signing the bill ``with reservations'' but
added: ``It is a significant improvement over the uncertainty and
confusion of existing state law. By taking the profit out of
childbirth, it stands firm against the buying and selling of human
life.
   ``Taking no action to regulate surrogacy contracts would be more
harmful than taking incomplete or imperfect action.''
   State Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a former Michigan Mother of the
Year, pushed the bill through the Legislature. She has said her
goal was to drive out of Michigan one of the nation's most prolific
surrogate matchmakers: Dearborn attorney Noel Keane. Keane takes
credit for arranging 228 surrogate births, including New Jersey's
``Baby M.''
   Under the new law, women who want to bear a child then give up
the baby to another couple still could do so and brokers could
still arrange surrogate births, but they all would have to do it
for free.
   Typically, infertile couples pay a broker $10,000 to match them
with a would-be mother. They pay another $10,000 to the woman who
agrees to be artifically inseminated, carry the child, then give up
custody. They also pay for the inseminations, medical procedures,
prenatal care, hospital bills and other pregnancy-related expenses.
   The new Michigan law declares those contracts unenforceable. If
people still wish to enter such a pact, the mother can be
reimbursed for her medical expenses and other pregnancy-related
expenses but nothing else.
   Despite the new law, some people question whether it might be
legal for a Michigan couple to sign a contract in another state and
carry out everything else in Michigan.
   Michigan is the first state to attach criminal penalties to
surrogate-parent contracts, but not the first to tackle the issue.
   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring such
contracts illegal, but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraska
doesn't recognize the legal validity of surrogate-parenting
contracts. Indiana has put enforcement of such arrangements on hold
while the issue is researched, and proposed regulations were vetoed
in Arkansas. In the landmark ``Baby M'' case, the New Jersey
Supreme Court outlawed surrogate-parenting contracts in that state.

<HEAD>Soviet Arms Deliveries To Nicaragua May Be Tapering Off</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has continued to ship arms to
Nicaragua despite a cease-fire and peace talks between the
Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, but the
amount of war materiel being delivered appears to be dropping
rapidly, Pentagon figures show.
   During the first five months of the year, Russia and its Warsaw
Pact allies shipped 5,500 metric tons _ or about 6,050 regular tons
_ of military equipment to the Sandinistas, according to Defense
Department estimates released Monday.
   By comparison, shipments of Soviet equipment during calendar
1987 arrived at an average rate of 1,808 metric tons per month _ or
9,040 metric tons for the first five months of 1987. That
translates to 9,944 regular tons.
   The drop in shipments is equally pronounced when expressed in
terms of estimated dollar value. The Pentagon estimated the
materiel delivered during the first five months of this year was
worth $160 million. Shipments in 1987 were worth about $42 million
a month _ or about $210 million for five months.
   During all of 1987, the Nicaraguans received 21,700 metric tons
of arms valued at $505 million, the Defense Department estimates.
   The new figures are contained in a Pentagon briefing paper that
is updated on a monthly basis for top administration officials. The
latest update provides estimates through the end of May.
   Defense officials who spoke only on condition they not be named
said Monday it was too early to predict Soviet intentions for
arming Nicaragua for the year. The military deliveries normally
fluctuate from month to month and there always could be a spurt
later in the year, one source noted.
   On the other hand, ``there is a feeling that perhaps the
Russians are less enthusiastic right now under (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev about handing out their resources around the
world.''
   The slowdown in deliveries to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government comes at a time when U.S. aid to the Contra guerrillas
has been cut completely. The Reagan administration, under
congressional pressure, ended its military assistance to the
Contras at the end of February, three weeks before a truce and
cease-fire took effect.
   Soviet arms shipments to the Sandinistas have climbed steadily
over the past eight years, rising from only about 1.6 metric tons
in 1980 to peak at 22,000 metric tons in 1986.

   Church members stood in line for about
30 minutes, waiting to express love and support for a minister who
got AIDS from a tainted blood transfusion.
   The Rev. Norwood Jones told the congregation at St. James United
Methodist Church that he learned in February that blood he received
during a heart operation in July 1986 was from a donor who carried
the AIDS virus.
   The 68-year-old associate minister told of his disease at a
Saturday afternoon service and again at three services Sunday. More
than 1,100 people attended.
   Price Roark, chairman of the church's Pastor-Parish Relations
Committee, said the 18-member committee gave overwhelming support
to Jones at a June 15 meeting and asked him to continue as one of
four assistant ministers.
   ``It was one of the most uplifting experiences I've had in
church in a long time,'' Roark said. ``Committee members stood
around for a long time after the meeting, hugging Norwood and
wishing him well.''
   The Rev. John P. Miles, senior minister of the 3,400-member
church, said there was a similar response Friday night at a meeting
of the church's administrative board. He said 70 members of the
100-member board were present and ``gave Mr. Jones a vote of
confidence and asked him to continue his work.''
   Miles said that although the AIDS infection was a tragedy for
Jones, who is a great-grandfather, and for the church, ``there's
something else here, too. This is an opportunity for this church to
give a ministry and to make a witness.''
   He said the church should be challenged to do some much-needed
educating on how a community responds to acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving
victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
There is no known cure.
   After Sunday's services, Jones said he decided to tell about his
situation ``in hopes some good might come'' of it.
   ``I felt there had to be some way to turn this for some use for
God, some good for others,'' he said.

   Villagers stoned rescue teams at the site
of a deadly landslide Monday, shouting at emergency crews: ``Why
don't you work faster to find the bodies?''
   Several hundred residents of this mountain village near the
Black Sea scuffled with police and soldiers near heaps of earth and
rock that buried a crowded roadside coffeehouse Thursday and
trapped up to 100 people.
   Witnesses of the protest in Catak, 575 miles southeast of Ankara
said two civil defense workers were injured by stones but no one
was arrested.
   One body was found the day of the landslide but none has been
discovered since. The crew of about 170 rescue workers has combed
about five acres of the mud and rock that crashed down on the
village, and officials have halted work frequently for fear of
causing more slides.
   A stream diverted by landslides also flooded part of Catak.
   Huseyin Gul, whose uncle ran the coffeehouse, shouted at the
rescue workers Monday: ``Five days have passed and my uncle is
still buried. What are you doing there?''
   Enver Hizlan, governor of Trabzon province, said the protest
began after workers temporarily halted the search, leading some
villagers to believe the effort had stopped.
   Officials said rescue teams would work all night under
searchlights.
   West German rescue teams helping with the work said they had
located debris from the coffeehouse but there was no chance of
finding any survivors.
   ``The building was shifted 30 meters by the force of the
landslide. Nobody could possibly have survived,'' said Wolfgang
Kretschmer, leader of a 32-member team from the West German Rescue
Dog Association.
   Deputy leader Hans Ruhl said he found ``a plate from the
coffeehouse but there was too much water around to take the dogs to
search for bodies.''
   Ruhl said the search was poorly organized at first, and ``for
the first three days there was no system to the rescue effort.
Nobody seemed to be in charge.''
   Catak is about 20 miles above Trabzon, a black sea port, among
hazelnut orchards and lush pasture land. The district attracts
growing number of foreign tourists who visit Byzantine ruins.
   Three West Germans and 50 Turks have been listing as missing. An
official of the regional government was killed by falling rocks and
31 people were reported injured in the landslide.

<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi on Monday
rejected allegations that he is a South African puppet and said he
has ``full sympathy'' for South African blacks fighting for an end
to apartheid.
   But Savimbi said his first priority is to bring an end to the
Soviet-Cuban presence in Angola and to promote a peaceful
settlement to the 13-year civil war in his homeland.
   Savimbi, who is on a 10-day good will tour of the United States,
spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the newly created Congressional
Task Force on Angola, which supports U.S. goals in the African
nation.
   As part of an effort to encourage the withdrawal of Cuban forces
in Angola and to achieve a negotiated settlement with Angola's
Marxist government, the United States has been supplying military
equipment to Savimbi's UNITA forces for the past several years.
   The Angolan government took out an advertisement in Monday's
editions of the New York Times highlighting Savimbi's ties to South
Africa, which has been supporting the UNITA war effort. The
advertisement called Savimbi ``South Africa's Secret Agent.''
   But Savimbi said he has been attempting to encourage South
African President P.W. Botha to release Nelson Mandela, the
anti-apartheid black leader who has been imprisoned since the 1960s.
   ``We have full sympathy for those fighting for freedom in South
Africa,'' Savimbi said.
   Savimbi said Cuba has sent an additional 12,000 troops to Angola
recently and has become the ``masters'' of Angola's fate. He said
the increase has raised the Cuban troop commitment to 57,000. U.S.
estimates put the figure at between 43,000 and 45,000.
   Savimbi said UNITA requires additional help from the United
States because Angola received $1.5 billion worth of weaponry from
the Soviet Union last year.
   ``There is no sign they are going to decrease,'' Savimbi said.
   Last week, the United States welcomed indications from the
Angolan government that it was not demanding a cessation of U.S.
support for UNITA in return for serious negotiations for a peace
settlement.
   Officials from the United States, Angola, Cuba and South Africa
met last week for a second time to explore the prospects for a
negotiated peace. The U.S. position has been that aid to UNITA is
not an appropriate topic for discussion in the talks.

<HEAD>Norwegian Leader Proposes Plan of Action on Climate</HEAD>
<HEAD>By JEFF BRADLEY</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway's environmentalist prime minister, Gro
Harlem Brundtland, opened a world conference on the changing
climate Monday with a plan of action on ways to preserve the
Earth's damaged atmosphere.
   She said the ``greenhouse effect,'' in which manmade pollution
trapped in the atmosphere is warming up the planet's surface,
presents humanity with a crucial question:
   ``Will we devote our abilities, our energy, and our efforts to
further short-term material well-being, or will we commit ourselves
to enhancing life on planet Earth?''
   Addressing more than 300 scientists from 40 countries,
Brundtland called for a new ``holistic'' ethic in which economic
growth and environmental protection go hand-in-hand around the
world.
   She is chairwoman of the U.N. World Commission on Environment
and Development, whose report last year, ``Our Common Future,'' was
hailed as a landmark.
   Brundtland said rich nations have a special responsibility.
   ``We have been playing lethal games with vital life-support
systems,'' the prime minister told participants in the Canadian
government-sponsored World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere.
   ``For too long have we used the atmosphere, soil and water as
the ultimate sink of our industrial excesses.''
   Her five-part plan calls for transfer of modern, low-polluting
technology to Third World countries now, so they won't repeat the
same mistakes made by industrialized nations.
   The plan also urges a standstill in energy use by the year 2000,
followed by efforts to reduce production and consumption levels,
and therefore pollution.
   Other points include more worldwide research on renewable energy
sources and climatic change, and consideration of a global
convention on atmospheric protection.
   The meeting was inspired by the Brundtland Commission's report
and was convened amidst the worst drought for 50 years across the
North American farm belt.
   But scientists said they were reluctant to connect the drought
with the long-term greenhouse effect caused by emissions of carbon
dioxide, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane. Most of the gases are
byproducts from burning coal, gas, oil and wood.
   ``The 1970s and 1980s have produced summer warming and
increasing incidence of severe drought,'' said Kenneth Hare,
chairman of Canada's Climate Program Planning Board.
   ``It's possibly the greenhouse effect at work, but our models
are not accurate enough to say it is,'' he added. ``However,
summers like this may well become more frequent and more extensive
in the future.''
   Hare said concentration of the greenhouse gases will double in
the first half of the 21st century, raising average temperatures by
up to 7 degrees, causing sea levels to rise and regional climates
to alter.
   With less moisture available, he said, ``winter wheat may well
be the standard crop of the future in the Canadian prairies instead
of the spring wheat we grow now.''
   Hare said nations should prohibit chemical compounds responsible
for the toxic gases and negotiate an international energy protocol
that would encourage hydroelectric power and re-examine the role of
nuclear energy.
   Robert T. Watson, chief of the Upper Atmosphere Research Program
at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said
combating the greenhouse effect will be much more complex that
tackling ozone depletion.
   Twenty-four nations signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol on
protecting the Earth's ozone layer by restricting
chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals used in aerosol sprays,
insulation, refrigerators and industrial cleaning. The ozone layer
protects the Earth from the sun's most harmful ultraviolet rays.
   But Watson said the buildup of methane gas in the atmosphere,
closely entwined with many industrial processes, is more mysterious.
   In opening the conference, Canada's Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney offered to act as host for a U.N. World Conference on
Sustainable Development in 1992.
   Mulroney also urged participants to start working on an
international ``law of the air'' that would discourage air
pollution in the way the International Law of the Sea controls the
oceans.
   But Watson said it was premature to start work on such an
international covenant, since researchers have much more to learn.
   ``It's quite clear that energy conservation is a good idea. The
less energy we burn, the less CO2 (carbon dioxide) will go into the
atmosphere. But how you translate that into international policy is
another matter,'' Watson said.

   Soldiers chased masked stone-throwers into a
West Bank high school Monday, closed 40 other schools and blocked a
main Jerusalem street to stop young Arabs from hurling rocks.
   Despite the measures, dozens of incidents were reported.
   Reports said soldiers arrested more than 50 Palestinians who
responded to a new underground leaflet urging ``escalation of the
struggle'' in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a rebellion
against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, masked Arab youths stoned
troops in the casbah, or central marketplace.
   Israel radio said soldiers opened fire on the stone-throwers,
wounding one of them in the leg. The army confirmed the clash and
said it was investigating the incident.
   Israeli leaders met privately Monday with U.S. envoy Michael
Armacost about a stalled American plan aimed at reaching a
settlement in the occupied territories and a Middle East peace
agreement.
   Foreign Ministry officials said Richard Murphy, the assistant
secretary of state who specializes in the Middle East, would meet a
Soviet representative next month in Europe to discuss coordinating
U.S. and Soviet approaches to peace.
   Ariel Sharon, a right-wing Cabinet minister, said the government
should be ``eliminating'' Palestinians who throw firebombs and
deporting those who take part in violent protests.
   During a speech in English at the Jewish settlement of Ariel in
the West Bank, he criticized Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for not
ending the rebellion and Rabin's Labor Party for recommending a
political solution rather than force.
   At least 211 Palestinians have been killed in nearly seven
months of violence among the 1.5 million who live in the occupied
territories, and four Israelis have been slain.
   About 500 more police were deployed in Jerusalem on Monday,
bringing the total number of security personnel in the city to
1,500, police spokesman Rafi Levy reported, but the reinforcements
could not stop stone-throwing.
   Police said eight stoning incidents were recorded in a single
hour Monday and seven Palestinians were arrested.
   Authorities closed Salah Eddin, the main shopping street of Arab
east Jerusalem, for an hour after stoning attacks in which an
Orthodox Jewish seminary student was slightly injured, police said.
Palestinians in east Jerusalem raised Palestinian flags, which
Israel has declared illegal.
   Palestinian protests Monday responded to an order in underground
Leaflet No. 20 signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and
underground leaders.
   It called for ``escalation of the struggle'' on Monday and
Tuesday, ``particularily in Jerusalem under the slogan of
`Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine.'''
   The Holy City is among the most contentious issues between
Israel and the Arabs. Israel captured the eastern sector in the
1967 war, along with the West Bank and Gaza, annexed it soon after
and made Jerusalem the Israeli capital.
   Most governments do not recognize Jerusalem, which is a holy to
Jews, Moslems and Christians, as Israel's capital.
   About 200 soldiers surrounded Al Hussein high school Monday in
Hebron, 20 miles south of Jerusalem, after students threw stones at
army vehicles, Arab witnesses told The Associated Press.
   Soldiers chased students into the school, firing rubber bullets
and tear gas, the witnesses said.
   Officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital said 25 students were
treated for injuries caused by tear gas or beatings. Witnesses said
soldiers detained about 50 students.
   Army spokesmen confirmed clashes with stone-throwing youths at
Al Hussein, including some who covered their faces with checkered
Arab scarves, but would not give details or say how many Arabs were
detained.
   Trouble started hours after the army bulldozed the home of Abdel
Majid Sharawne, 22, who is charged with stabbing a Jewish settler
in Hebron three days ago. The settler chased Sharawne after the
stabbing and shot him, and the Palestinian later was taken into
army custody.
   Sharawne's home was the second building wrecked by Israeli
authorities in two days. On Sunday, soldiers blew up the second
story of a building in the Gaza Strip from which they said
assailants threw a firebomb that badly burned two troopers last
week.
   The army closed 40 schools in Nablus, 40 miles north of
Jerusalem and the West Bank's largest city, citing repeated
stone-throwing incidents. Military officials said they would be
closed at least several days.
   High school students in Bethlehem boycotted classes Monday and
soldiers were seen turning several hundred pupils away from two
junior high schools in the nearby Dheishe refugee camp.
   The army denied allegations that soldiers gave Palestinians
injections in the West Bank's Al Amari refugee camp to obtain
information about stone-throwers.
   Nader Mahli, 24, said soldiers seized him Friday, gave him an
injection, then demanded the names of stone-throwers and members of
the Shabiba, a PLO youth movement. Masaad Jaber, a U.N. driver,
said soldiers also gave his son Midhad an injection during
interrogation.

   Latvian Communists have proposed in their program
for a 5,000-member conference that the Soviet Communist Party
leader be elected by direct secret ballot and face a mandatory
retirement age.
   The Latvians followed proposals of another Baltic state,
Estonia, in demanding more economic and political autonomy, but
they were the first to call openly for such firm limits on the
position of general secretary, now held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Suggestions approved by the policy-making Central Committee in
May call for the tenure of party elected officials to be limited to
two five-year terms. That could be one of the key items of debate
at the party conference, which begins Tuesday.
   Unlimited terms of office and the absence of any retirement age
have allowed party leaders to build over the years a system of
entrenched power and privilege.
   The program of the Latvian delegation was published in the June
18 edition of the official newspaper Sovietskaya Latvia. The
newspaper was received in Moscow on Monday, the eve of the first
party conference since 1941.
   ``For this, in part, it is proposed to carry out direct
elections by secret ballot for the top leaders of party organs
(from the secretary of the party bureau of primary party
organizations to the Central Committee's general secretary),
establish limited terms of office for all without exception, to
establish a single retirement age for all party leaders,'' the
platform said.
   The party leader now is chosen by the ruling Politburo and
confirmed by the Central Committee. It was not clear from the text
of the Latvian proposal who would be allowed to vote for the
general secretary.
   Gorbachev has said he supports limits on the terms of party
officials.
   The Latvian group also proposed that a national monument to the
victims of Stalin's purges be built in Moscow.
   Earlier this month, the official Soviet media said such a
monument had been approved in Latvia to commemmorate those deported
by Stalin after the Soviet Union annexed Latvia, Estonia and the
third Baltic republic, Lithuania, in 1940.
   The Baltic republics are the Soviet Union's most
westward-looking and technologically advanced. Latvia followed the
lead of Estonia in demanding greater economic freedom from Moscow
and the power to exercise it.
   Latvians must have the power to determine ``the basic questions
connected with the determination of structure and activity of the
republic and local organs of government power and administration,''
it said.
   They also demanded control over ``key functions of running the
economy of the republic, decision of questions of establishing
prices, tariffs, pay for labor, financial and credit policies.''
   The program called for legal guarantees against interference in
local affairs by officials in Moscow.

   Syrian-allied Palestinian dissidents
overran Beirut's Chatilla refugee camp in a 13-hour battle Monday,
and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's fighters surrendered or laid down
their weapons, police said.
   The fall of the camp dealt a serious setback for Arafat's
mainstream Fatah, which has been fighting Col. Saeed Mousa's
radical Fatah-Uprising faction since May 1 for control of the
Chatilla and nearby Bourj el-Barajneh camps.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization openly blamed Syria for
the fighting.
   The PLO Executive Committee, the guerrilla movement's
policy-making body, said the government of Syrian President Hafez
Assad ``is implementing a black political scheme aimed at
undermining the Palestinian presence in Lebanon.''
   About 140 of Arafat's men in Chatilla surrendered to Syrian and
Libyan officers, police said.
   Sixty other Arafat loyalists, including 45 believed to be
wounded, told Libyan mediators they had put down their weapons and
asked to be taken to Arafat's bases in south Lebanon, police said.
   Police said arrangements were being made to take the 60
fighters, holed up in the camp's only bomb shelter, in a bus convoy
with Syrian and Libyan escorts to the southern port city of Sidon
on Tuesday.
   ``We're not going to hurt them after they've surrendered,'' said
one Mousa fighter who declined to give his name.
   In Sidon, police said a car bomb exploded near a Fatah office in
the Mieh Mieh refugee camp, killing three Palestinian guerrillas
and wounding six.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but radio stations said
the bombing was an attempt to assassinate guerrilla leader Munir
Madbah, who commands Fatah's Force 17 security unit in Sidon. Force
17 has claimed responsibility for several terrorist attacks in
Israel over the last three years.
   Heavy fighting also broke out for a half-hour Monday night
between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Syrian
troops in the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, the Christian-run Voice
of Lebanon radio reported.
   There was no independent verification of the clashes reported in
Baalbeck, 42 miles east of Beirut, and the radio said nothing of
casualities.
   Syria, Iran's main Arab ally in Iran's war against Iraq, has
been alarmed by the Tehran government's attempt through Hezbollah
to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiite Moslems, the nation's
largest sect.
   Virtually every building in the Chatilla camp was wrecked or
heavily damaged in the fighting.
   ``No earthquake could have wreaked such devastation,'' said a
Syrian officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In all, 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since May 1,
when the rival factions began fighting for control of the two camps
on Beirut's southern outskirts.
   Mousa's guerrillas stormed into Chatilla during the night and
trapped Arafat's men, police said.
   ``You have a last chance to surrender and turn yourselves in to
the Syrian army or face a final onslaught,'' the dissident command
said in a statement communicated to the encircled loyalists.
   Many of Arafat's men stumbled out of the cement block shanties
with their hands clasped on their heads.
   Police said Syrian Army officers and Libyan observers took
charge of the men who surrendered, while negotiations continued for
the surrender of the other 60.
   Four Libyan mediators headed by Maj. Salim Farjani, shuttled
between the bomb shelter and Mousa's headquarters.
   ``We're here to stop the bloodletting,'' Farjani told reporters.
``Any new attack from either side is going to be considered an
aggression against Libya.'' He did not elaborate.
   The Syrians, whose troops ring the camps, insisted on arresting
Fatah's commander in Chatilla, Youssef Sharkawi, his
second-in-command who also is known as Nader, and his assistant,
Amneh Jibril, the official said.
   Sharkawi and Nader were among the wounded, he said.
   The official predicted that Mousa's guerrillas would soon start
bombarding the sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh camp ``within a few
days, possibly hours.''
   Radio stations reported that Arafat appealed to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to pressure Syria to stop the bombardment of
the Beirut camps. He reportedly made similar pleas to Libya,
Algeria and Tunisia.
   PLO officials earlier appealed to Assad to intervene to rein in
the dissidents, or at least stop them using Syrian-controlled
territory to shell the camps.
   Syria has thousands of troops enforcing security in west and
south Beirut. But they made no move to stop the fighting, which
flared despite a reconciliation between Arafat and Assad in April
to end a 5-year-old feud over who would control the Palestinian
movement.
   Monday's PLO statement attacking Syria _ issued in Nicosia,
Cyprus, and Tunis, Tunisia, where the PLO has its political
headquarters _ did not say what effect the latest events would have
on the Assad-Arafat reconciliation.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Monday he will travel to Moscow in early August for his third
meeting with Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov on reducing
military tension between the superpowers.
   In the first business session between the Soviet and U.S.
defense secretaries, Carlucci and Yazov met in Bern, Switzerland,
last March and for a second time during the Moscow summit May
31-June 2.
   The ``dialogue is not valuable for its own sake, but only as a
means to enhance our security,'' Carlucci said in a speech at the
National Press Club. ``Our discussions in Bern and last month in
Moscow were candid and, I think precisely because of that,
constructive.''
   ``We have gained a great deal from having an opportunity to air
our differences, and to explore ways that we might improve our
relations,'' he said. ``As in our earlier meetings, our agenda will
include exploring ways to avoid dangerous military incidents, and
to expand military-to-military contacts.''
   Carlucci said he was skeptical of the reform rhetoric of Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and of Soviet claims that ``they are
shifting to a purely defensive military posture.''
   ``For my part, I have indicated that the United States would
welcome such a shift, but that in spite of Soviet claims, we see no
change in the Soviet force structure and no reduction in resources
devoted to the Soviet military, which continues to absorb between
15 and 17 percent of the Soviet'' gross national product, he said.
   ``Now is not the time to let down our guard,'' he said. ``There
is every reason to believe that the Soviets see in our technology a
way to derive not only economic but military advantage.''
   ``If the end result of reform is a Soviet Union that is less
expansionist, that reduces the resources it now devotes to the
military, that delivers on its promises to respect fundamental
freedoms and human rights, that is more open to dialogue with the
West, then change will have been for the better,'' Carlucci said.

<HEAD>Editor Indicted On Criminal Libel Charge</HEAD>

   A weekly newspaper editor was indicted
Monday on a charge of criminally libeling two state lawmakers.
   If convicted on the rarely used law, the editor, Jim Fitts,
could be the first journalist sent to prison for libel in recent
memory, journalism advocates said.
   Fitts said afterward that he expected the decision by the grand
jury and would ask to have the trial moved out of the county.
   ``The power structure has long roots in Williamsburg County,''
he said.
   But the attorney for the two men who brought the suit said Fitts
is only seeking publicity. ``I think he's got a million dollars
worth of publicity for a slander sheet,'' Wallace Connor said.
   State Rep. B.J. Gordon and state Sen. Frank McGill, both
Democrats, brought the charges in response to a May 17 column in
which Fitts urged voters to reject the county's legislators in the
June primary and accused them of stealing.
   Both McGill and Gordon won re-nomination in that election.
   Fitts, the 62-year-old black editor of The Voice, a
black-oriented newspaper with a circulation of 2,300, riled Gordon,
who is black, and McGill, who is white, with the column.
   It said: ``I will say to you, without fear of contradiction, if
every black in Williamsburg County would start stealing today and
steal every day for the rest of their lives, they could not steal
as much as those two have stolen during their time in power.''
   The column gave no specifics. When asked later what he thought
they had stolen, Fitts said only that they had taken the pride of
people of Williamsburg County.
   Sitting in the first row of the 165-year-old county courthouse,
Fitts showed no emotion as the indictment was read.
   ``I'm not surprised. I'm not disappointed,'' he said afterward.
``And I welcome the opportunity to be heard in court. I got what I
wanted.''
   The case probably will be tried in late August or early
September at the earliest, Solicitor Wade Kolb has said.
   If convicted, Fitts could face $5,000 in fines and a year in
prison on each of the two counts. He is free on personal
recognizance bond.
   Though libel lawsuits are not unusual, criminal libel cases that
can send a journalist to jail are.
   The Williamsburg County case is believed to be only the fourth
involving journalists in 40 years in South Carolina and the first
such case in the nation since 1984.
   The South Carolina chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union
said Monday it will ask dismissal of the charges.

<HEAD>Democrats Select Texan Ann Richards To Deliver Keynote Address</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 9th graf to add Richards' interest in Texas
governorship; ADDS 1 graf of additional background.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Ann Richards, fiery populist and Texas state
treasurer, was chosen Monday to deliver the keynote speech and
``set the tone'' for the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
next month.
   Party chief Paul G. Kirk said Ms. Richards ``has the ability to
tell it like it is'' as he announced that the 54-year-old will be
the second woman in party history to take the podium to deliver the
opening address of the meeting. She is the first woman to hold
statewide office in Texas in half a century.
   Kirk said the Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis was
consulted on the choice and was interested in having a woman to
step to the podium on July 18.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' Kirk said, ``not only because of the importance of the
family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that women are
going through in the daily work lives and family lives, but I think
it is symbolic of the importance of women to the American family
and the realities of all of that.
   ``And the fact that, let's face it, that is a strength of the
Democratic Party and a weakness of George Bush and the
Republicans.''
   Ms. Richards, who held a news conference in Austin, Texas,
shortly after Kirk's announcement, said American families are
``what I know the most about, other than my professional job.''
   Known for her sparkling rhetoric, Ms. Richards said she honed
her speaking ability on the soap boxes of small-town Texas.
   ``For about the past 10 years I've been making speeches at the
Madisonville Cattleman's Association and the McAllen
Mexican-American Democrats convention and the Nacogdoches Chamber
of Commerce and in any number of places that you think of,'' Ms.
Richards said. ``It's sort of like, `How do you get to Carnegie
Hall?' You just practice.'''
   Ms. Richards, who plans to seek the Texas governorship in 1990,
emerged over the weekend as the likely choice for the keynote job,
which offers a national audience to impress or disappoint. The only
other woman ever to have the role was former Rep. Barbara Jordan,
also of Texas, who shared the job with Sen. John Glenn of Ohio.
   Kirk said he was happy to announce that Ms. Richards would ``set
the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and to draw the distinctions
between the party of the working American people and the party of
the establishment. Ann Richards is a mainstream Democrat and a
fiery populist from Texas, one of George Bush's adopted states.''
   ``She has the ability to tell it like it is and speak in the
language ... working Americans can understand and relate to,'' he
added.
   Kirk was asked if the selection of another Texan for a prominent
role at the Atlanta meeting July 18-21 was indicative of the
importance of the state in the fall. House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas is the convention chairman.
   ``In fact, when you look at the Electoral College map, you can't
do enough for Texas,'' Kirk said.
   Kirk defended Wright's role as chairman of the convention,
despite the investigations focusing on charges of unethical
behavior against the House speaker.
   ``There is no hesitancy on my part or on the part of the
Democratic Party about Speaker Wright's role at the convention,''
Kirk said.
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Kirk said in answer to a question that he would be glad to serve
as Democratic National Committee chairman through the general
election, even though his term expires right after the convention.
But after the election, ``That will be that.''
   Ms. Richards was born on Sept. 1, 1933, outside of Waco, Texas.
A graduate of Baylor University, she was first elected to office as
a member of the Travis County Commissioner's Court in 1976. In
1982, she was elected state treasurer, the first woman to hold
statewide office there in over 50 years.
   She is a divorced mother of four grown children.

<HEAD>City Council Drops Proposed Citywide Skateboarding Ban; Downtown
Ban Eyed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council will consider banning
skateboarding only in the downtown business district after both
youths and grownups objected Monday to the idea of a citywide
prohibition on the popular sport.
   In chambers packed with concerned skateboarders, ages 8 to 32,
Mayor Bill Frederick said the council had decided to rewrite a bill
and scale down the proposed ban.
   City officials, police and property owners said they were
concerned with safety, property damage and vandalism in initially
proposing a prohibition on all public streets, sidewalks and
property.
   ``We need to build a place where we can all skate. ... We can
work together for it,'' said 16-year-old Rick Andrews.
   His comments typified the sentiment of the crowd of 50 to 60
young people appearing at City Hall to protest the proposal.
   The youngsters, many in shorts and T-shirts and some carrying
their skateboards into the council chambers, said damage and
vandalism were restricted to a small percentage of people and
resulted from not having any place in which they could practice the
popular sport.
   The young people got support from a number of parents and other
grownups.
   Only one person spoke up for a limited ban but he, too, said the
city should work with skateboarders, businessmen and property
owners toward the construction of skate parks or ramps.
   Calling the revised plan ``a major change in direction,'' the
mayor said the city was concerned about its liability if it built a
skateboarding area. But he urged the youths to form a committee to
work with city officials on an ordinance and a possible park.
   Gene Groves, an active skateboarder, told the commission that
skateboarding is ``a principal form of transportation'' for many
young people, ``particularly those too young to drive.''
   He and others said other Florida cities such as Ocala, Tampa and
Jacksonville had public and private skateboard parks and Orlando
should, too.
   The council action Monday puts the issue back into the
discussion stage. Further meetings will be held before it comes up
for another public hearing.
   Under the proposal, skateboarding also would be outlawed on
private property, such as parking lots, without permission from the
owners. Violators would face a maximum fine of $500 and 60 days in
jail.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Monday he will travel to Moscow in early August for his third
meeting with Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov, and the
second-ranking Soviet defense official will tour the United States
in July.
   The exchange of visits is aimed at reducing military tension
between the superpowers as part of a general widening and
improvement in the U.S.-Soviet dialogue.
   In the first business session between the Soviet and U.S.
defense secretaries, Carlucci and Yazov met in Bern, Switzerland,
last March and for a second time during the Moscow summit May
31-June 2.
   The ``dialogue is not valuable for its own sake, but only as a
means to enhance our security,'' Carlucci said in a speech at the
National Press Club. ``Our discussions in Bern and last month in
Moscow were candid and, I think precisely because of that,
constructive.''
   ``We have gained a great deal from having an opportunity to air
our differences, and to explore ways that we might improve our
relations,'' he said. ``As in our earlier meetings, our agenda will
include exploring ways to avoid dangerous military incidents, and
to expand military-to-military contacts.''
   The Soviet first deputy defense minister, Marshal Sergei F.
Akhromeyev, will make a July 5-11 visit to the United States at the
invitation of Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staffs, the Pentagon and Soviet news agency Tass announced.
   Akhromeyev was in Washington last December for the summit, but
the upcoming trip, ``will be his first visit outside the nation's
capital,'' the Pentagon announcement said.
   Akhromeyev, the Soviet chief of staff, ``will tour military
units from all four military services and will travel to Virginia,
North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, South Dakota and New York during
his visit,'' it said.
   Crowe and Akhromeyev will have joint news conferences on July 6
and July 11, and on July 11, the Soviet marshal will address a
meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.
   Akhromeyev will not be allowed to view any classified training
or equipment, the Pentagon said, but he will visit Camp Lejeune,
N.C.; the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt; Fort Hood,
Texas; and Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D.
   The Soviet defense official will be allowed to view a new B-1B
bomber, but will not be allowed to fly in one, the Pentagon added.
   In his speech, Carlucci said he was skeptical of the reform
rhetoric of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and of Soviet
claims that ``they are shifting to a purely defensive military
posture.''
   ``For my part, I have indicated that the United States would
welcome such a shift, but that in spite of Soviet claims, we see no
change in the Soviet force structure and no reduction in resources
devoted to the Soviet military, which continues to absorb between
15 and 17 percent of the Soviet'' gross national product, he said.
   ``Now is not the time to let down our guard,'' he said. ``There
is every reason to believe that the Soviets see in our technology a
way to derive not only economic but military advantage.''
   ``If the end result of reform is a Soviet Union that is less
expansionist, that reduces the resources it now devotes to the
military, that delivers on its promises to respect fundamental
freedoms and human rights, that is more open to dialogue with the
West, then change will have been for the better,'' Carlucci said.
   ``On the other hand, if the end product of Soviet restructuring
is nothing more than the development, perhaps even with Western
assistance, of a stronger Soviet military machine, then we in the
West will face a far more dangerous threat than we do at present,''
he said.
   An aide to Carlucci said that the exact dates and interinary of
the trip to Moscow would not be announced until next month.

<TEXT>
   The man chosen as the first cardinal from
Marxist-governed Mozambique said Monday that relations with the
church have improved and predicted the government will establish
diplomatic relations with the Vatican.
   Archbishop Alexandre Jose Maria dos Santos of Maputo also
expressed hope his appointment will help persuade the government to
accept the appeal of the Roman Catholic Church for negotiations
toward ending the African nation's civil war.
   Dos Santos is one of 24 new cardinals Pope John Paul II plans to
elevate at a Vatican ceremony Tuesday. In other appointments with
special political signifance, John Paul named cardinals from
Lithuania and Hong Kong to strenghthen the church in the Soviet
Union and China.
   Two American archbishops also are on the list of new princes of
the church: James A. Hickey of Washington and Edmund C. Szoka of
Detroit.
   John Paul is scheduled to visit Mozambique during his September
tour of southern Africa. Church-state relations in Mozambique were
severely strained after independence from Portugal in 1975, when
religious were either closed or nationalized, and some churches
were shut down in the late 1970s.
   In his comments Monday, dos Santos said Mozambique's government
said last week it would return all church property seize in 1975,
including a large Catholic seminary in Maputo.
   ``It is true that the government is changing its attitude toward
the church and I hope the government is now open to solve all the
problems through dialogue with the church,'' the 64-year-old
prelate said.
   ``The government is not against religion any more. The
government has now come to understand that we have the right to
practice our religion.''
   He said churches are crowded and his appointment as cardinal was
greeted with ``much rejoicing, dancing, singing and shouting. This
gives more hope to the Mozambique people.''
   The Vatican and the government in Maputo, Mozambique's capital,
have indicated interest in diplomatic relatons and the issue was
discussed when President Joaquim Alberto Chissano met John Paul at
the Vatican in May 1987.
   ``I think the government is open, willing and asking for
diplomatic relations with the Holy See,'' dos Santos said. ``The
government has said to us, `We are ready.' Now it depends on the
Holy See. I think that it will not be long before diplomatic
relations are established.''
   He said the church and state continue to differ on the
11-year-old war waged by the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrillas, known as Renamo.
   Bishops have called for negotiations but the government has
refused, contending that the guerrillas are terrorists controlled
by South Africa.

<TEXT>
   A new Airbus 320 that crashed at an air show was
flying too low for the load it carried and the pilot did not have
time to maneuver it out of danger, officials said Monday after a
preliminary investigation.
   Three passengers were killed and 50 injured as the jetlinger
crashed into the woods Sunday during a demonstration flight near
Mulhouse in eastern France.
   Daniel Tennenbaum, chief of the Civil Aviation Authority, said
the Air France jet was flying at 30 feet.
   In Mulhouse, prosecutor Jean Volff said: ``The A320 passed at 30
feet altitude, which is completely outside the technical norms when
it is carrying passengers.''
   He said the normal minimum altitude for such conditions was 100
feet and added, without giving details, that the pilot had
``disconnected the automatic controls at the moment of the accident
and was in manual control.''
   Tennenbaum told a news conference in Paris the fully
computerized aircraft needed eight seconds to respond to the
command of pilot Michel Hasseline and only five seconds were
available because of the low altitude.
   Hasseline was quoted in the French press Monday as telling a
rescuer: ``I wanted to increase the power, but the aircraft did not
respond.''
   Louis Mermaz, the transport minister, said the crash did not
reflect on the performance of the A320.
   He said there was ``no available element that puts into question
the good functioning of the aircraft and the security of A320
flights during normal functioning. Nothing justifies ending A320
flights.''
   Mermaz said he called the news conference because news reports
questioned the new aircraft's reliability and ``it was important to
respond quickly to the legitimate public questions.''
   A spokesman for Airbus Industrie, the manufacturer, said earlier
there were indications human error caused the crash, but Christian
Roger, president of the Air France pilots' union, said the engines
may have failed to restart at the pilot's command. The aircraft was
carrying 133 people.
   The union added in a statement: ``if the breakdown was in the
computer, there would be no information on it in the black box.''
   Mermaz, also speaking earlier Monday, said both flight recorders
_ or ``black boxes'' containing flight data _ were recovered, ``so
the inquiry should be rapid.''
   Government officials said privately the pilot, Hasseline, and
co-pilot Pierre Mazieres were not injured and should be able to
help investigators.
   Authorities in Mulhouse identified the dead late Monday as Herve
Liermann, a 14-year-old paraplegic from a village near Mulhouse who
could not escape the fire; Marianne Barry, 7, of Mulhouse, and
Marie-Francoise Foresch, 42, of Tours.
   The narrow-bodied A320 was developed by a European consortium
over four years at a cost of $2 billion. The $60 million
twin-engine aircraft entered service in April advertised as the
fastest-selling plane in history, and Airbus says it already has
orders for about 500.
   It can carry 150 to 180 people and consumes 40 percent less fuel
than similar planes with two or three jet engines. France, Britain,
West Germany and Spain are partners in the consortium.
   In the crash Sunday, the plane clipped some trees during a low
pass over the airfield and plunged into a forest in front of
television cameras and about 1,000 people attending the Mulhouse
air show. Only the red, white and blue tail was left unscorched.
   An official in the control tower, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the jet appeared to lose power as it passed over
the field in Habsheim, a village about 15 miles from the Swiss
border.
   Air France and British Airways have two A320s each and grounded
them after the accident, but later announced they were convinced
the plane was safe and operations would resume Tuesday.
   No U.S. airline has A320s yet, but Northwest has 100 on order
and Pan Am has 16 ordered with an option to buy 34 more.
   The A320 has a fully computerized flight-control system, which
the manufacturer says permits safer, electronically controlled
flight. The only commercial airliner with a similar system is the
supersonic Concorde.
   Five computers modify and relay the pilot's directions to wing
and tail flaps, but a mechanical cable link to the tail would allow
the pilot to fly manually in an emergency.
   Air France took delivery Thursday of the plane that crashed, and
had flown it six times Saturday. The A320 was certified for flight
Feb. 26.
   Airbus spokesman David Velupillai said Monday the company ``very
encouraged'' by the transport minister's statements.
   ``We are at the begininning of the commercialization of this
aircraft ... and we certainly would have preferred that this not
happen,'' he said, but ``we are not at all worried.''

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate Against Romanian Village Destruction Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30,000 Hungarians rallied Monday
against a Romanian plan to destroy thousands of villages that would
affect many members of the ethnic Hungarian minority, the official
MTI news agency said.
   The hour-long torchlight gathering at the downtown Heroes Square
was the biggest unofficial demonstration in Hungary since the
anti-Soviet uprising that was crushed in 1956, and the first such
rally permitted by police in this communist nation.
   There had been fear Romanian instigators might use the gathering
to incite illegal actions, but no incidents were reported.
   In March, President Nicolae Ceausescu announced plans for
demolishing 7,000 Romanian villages that would be replaced by big
agricultural-industrial centers.
   The forced resettlement program would affect hundreds of
villages Romania's 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, who complain of
official discrimination and say they are denied ethnic and cultural
rights.
   A manifesto read to the crowd said: ``After 50 years there is
another criminal committing genocide.''
   Hungarian intellectuals have repeatedly denounced as genocide
both the project for demolishing villages and Romania's alleged
policy of discrimination against ethnic Hungarians.
   The manifesto also referred to the mass murder of Jews and other
civilians committed by the Nazis before and during World War II.
   It was composed by Istvan Csurka, a prominent Hungarian
non-conformist writer, and read by actor Istvan Bubik. It combined
appeals for restraint and for solidarity with ethnic Hungarians in
Romania.
   Thousands were allowed to assemble in historic Heroes Square
without police interference, the manifesto said, and declared: ``It
is a victory that we are here but it is also a tragedy.''
   Relations between the neighboring Warsaw Pact nations have
deteriorated rapidly over the issue of ethnic Hungarians. Romania
accuses Hungary of interfering in its internal affairs.
   Observers as a possible sign the new Hungarian leadership will
take a tough stand regarding Romania.
   Csurka appealed to Hungarians to show solidarity and
determination in trying to prevent what the Magyar Nemzet newspaper
earlier Monday called Romania's ``bulldozer revolution.''
   Numerous banners at the rally denounced the resettlement plan.
   Scores of demonstrators held up signs of place names in
Hungarian, German and Romanian that they fear will vanish from the
map.
   After the rally, most of those assembled marched to the Romanian
Embassy with a memorandum for the Romanians protesting the
demolition project.
   The Romanian state-run media have said the program aims at
gaining more farmland for use by the country's collectivized
agriculture, plagued by lack of incentives for farmers and
livestock fodder shortages.

   Democratic officials tapped Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards
on Monday to ``draw the distinctions'' between Democrats and
Republicans in the keynote address at their national convention
next month, while Michael Dukakis intensified his search for a vice
presidential running mate.
   The pre-convention Democratic flurry came as Vice President
George Bush, alternating campaign activities with his official
duties, met with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
Washington.
   Democrat Jesse Jackson was in Atlantic City, N.J., to watch two
other heavyweights in action, boxers Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks.
   And a fresh poll indicated that Dukakis owns a double-digit lead
over Bush, but may be vulnerable to attack since he is not well
known among the voters despite months of campaigning through the
primaries.
   Democratic Party chairman Paul Kirk held a news conference in
Washington to announce that Ms. Richards, 54, would deliver the
keynote address in prime time on the July 18 opening night of the
convention in Atlanta. He said the decision was cleared in advance
with Dukakis.
   The choice seemed to signal a desire to court not only female
voters, who favor Dukakis in the polls, but also Southerners, who
do not.
   Kirk said she was picked to ``set the tone for Democrats in
Atlanta and to draw the distinctions between the party of the
working American people and the party of of the establishment. Ann
Richards is a mainstream Democrat and a fiery populist from Texas,
one of George Bush's adopted states.''
   In Texas, Ms. Richards, the divorced mother of four grown
children, said, ``I probably will be talking very much about
American families. I think that's what I know the most about, other
than my professional job.''
   She said the speaking ability praised by Kirk and others was
sharpened on the soap boxes of small-town Texas.
   ``For about the past 10 years I've been making speeches at the
Madisonville Cattlemen's Association and the McAllen
Mexican-American Democrats convention and the Nacogdoches Chamber
of Commerce and in any number of places that you think of,'' she
said.
   Dukakis was wrapping up a four-day vacation at the Massachusetts
island resort of Nantucket. Aides said he would travel to
Washington on Wednesday to meet with several dozen senators,
including some who have been mentioned as possible running mates.
   No names were disclosed, but sources said the campaign has asked
for background information from several possible vice presidential
contenders, including Jesse Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Bob
Graham of Florida, Llyod Bentsen of Texas and Sam Nunn of Georgia
and Reps. Thomas Foley of Washington and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Nunn, however, said Monday in a telephone interview that he does
not have plans to provide any such information to the Dukakis
campaign. And he said he has told Dukakis he is not interested in
being on the ticket, though he expressed willingness to confer with
him on the selection of a running mate and other issues.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri have surfaced as additional contenders in recent days,
even though Gephardt and Dukakis targeted one another with
hard-hitting television commercials last winter during the primary
campaign.
   Dukakis' aides cast doubt on published reports that the governor
might announce his selection as early as this weekend. But Dukakis
himself has said he hopes to make his choice in advance of the
convention, and aides expect him and his running mate to make a
quick campaign trip immediately after the convention in Atlanta.
   Ms. Richards, the first woman to hold statewide office in Texas
in 50 years, is known for her fiery speaking style and her populist
views.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' Kirk said of Dukakis. ``Not only because of the importance
of the family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives,
but I think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the
American family and the realities of all of that.
   ``And the fact that, let's face it, that is a strength of the
Democratic Party and a weakness of George Bush and the
Republicans.''
   Kirk defended House Speaker Jim Wright's role as chairman of the
convention, despite the investigations focusing on charges of
unethical behavior. He also announced the appointment of four
co-chairmen for the convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep.
Norman Mineta of California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and
Little Rock, Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Bush has been buffeted with bad news in the polls in recent
weeks, and a large new survey conducted for the Times Mirror Corp,
was no exception. Bush trails Dukakis by 53 percent to 40 percent,
the survey found, and analyst Norman Ornstein said voters'
satisfaction with the current state of the economy is overwhelmed
by their fears about the long-term fate of the nation.
   Still, Ornstein said Bush should be able to exploit Dukakis'
relatively fuzzy image among the voters.
   ``This poll doesn't tell who will win the election,'' Ornstein
told reporters. ``For most Americans, Michael Dukakis is a blank
slate. In the next couple of months, there will be a lot written on
the slate, and not just by Dukakis _ but also by the media and by
George Bush and the Republicans.''
   The survey, the latest in a series for the media company
conducted by the Gallup Organization, was based on interviews with
3,021 adults in person from May 13-22. The margin of potential
sampling error was two percentage points.
   In another development, a Democratic-controlled legislative
committee in Massachusetts refused to begin an investigation into a
Dukakis administration plan to build a state prison in the town of
New Braintree. The FBI announced last week that is is conducting a
preliminary investigation into the affair, although it said in an
unusual statement that Dukakis was not a subject of the probe.

<HEAD>Burnley Warns Of Veto If Congress Tampers With Rail Deregulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley told the
Senate Commerce Committee Monday that Congress should expect a veto
if it passes legislation rewriting the 8-year-old law deregulating
the railroad industry.
   Burnley's message came in the form of a letter to key members of
the Senate panel on the day before it was to consider a bill
sponsored by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
   The legislation would amend the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 to aid
shippers of coal, grain and other commodities who contend they are
being harmed by railroad monopolies.
   But Burnley said in his letter that Rockefeller's measure
``would erode the substantial gains achieved under the Staggers
Act. The president's senior advisers would recommend a veto of (the
legislation) or a bill resembling this bill if it were presented to
the president for his signature.''
   Many railroads have opposed altering the Staggers Act, which
they say gave them needed pricing and service flexibility and
enabled them to better compete with trucks. Congress enacted the
1980 law to give Conrail and other railroads incentives to rebuild
failing and antiquated systems.
   But a coalition of shippers has said the Interstate Commerce
Commission, in its interpretation of Staggers, has failed to
protect shippers, especially those dependent on a single railroad
to transport their wares.
   A key provision of the bill would force the ICC to periodically
adjust its cost index to reflect productivity gains by railroads.
The ICC uses the index to determine how much freight railroads can
increase their rates each quarter to keep up with inflation.
Shippers contend the formula does not account for gains railroads
have made to make them more efficient.
   Congressional and administration aides said that Rockefeller was
negotiating with several railroads Monday to try to win support for
the bill.
   Burnley sent his letter to committee chairman Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C.; and to Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., the panel's
ranking Republican.

   Acknowledging problems with a
controversial paper on AIDS, a national conference of Roman
Catholic bishops decided unanimously Monday to write a new
statement in consultation with the Vatican.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, who made the motion for a
new paper on AIDS teachings, said the paper ``The Many Faces of
AIDS _ A Gospel Response'' could still be used however bishops wish.
   The last of the major items on the agenda at the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops at St. John's University, the AIDS
paper proposed to have the church teach about condoms as a way to
stem transmission of AIDS.
   The paper, written by the bishops conference's administrative
board, had been criticized by some church officials as an apparent
endorsement of condoms. The church opposes all forms of artificial
birth control.
   ``We're not replacing it. The first document stands,''
Archbishop John May of St. Louis told a news conference following
Monday's closed session.
   ``This new document will be a document of the whole conference,
all the bishops together,'' May said. ``It will carry the
discussion further.''
   The church leaders said the existing paper on AIDS should have
been clearer on the church teachings about condoms and should have
been drafted in closer consultation with the Vatican.
   May said he would appoint a panel of bishops to draft a new AIDS
statement in time for consideration by the next conference, to be
held in November in Washington, D.C.
   In retrospect, May said, it was a mistake for the administrative
board to release the AIDS document before review by the Vatican and
the full conference of roughly 300 bishops.
   On the other hand, he said, ``Many bishops were clamoring for
something to use in their general communities. It was a judgment
call that it was more important to get it done and get it out.''
   The paper framed sharp differences between conservative and
liberal factions and questions over the role of the bishops
conference in teaching parishioners.
   It had stressed abstinence from sex outside marriage and
fidelity within marriage. But, noting that many in society reject
church teachings on sexuality, it says education programs could
include ``accurate information about prophylactic devices'' as a
means of preventing transmission of AIDS.
   The incurable, fatal disease is spread mainly by the exchange of
blood or semen during sexual contact or by intravenous drug use.
   Bernardin said the new paper would try to clarify the church's
position on the acceptability of condoms as an AIDS-prevention
measure. But it was ``grossly premature'' to speculate on what
position the new paper would take, he said.
   The new document, he said, ``can make any clarifications which
are needed to put to rest any doubts which might exist regarding
the church's teaching on sexuality and how that teaching applies to
the current (AIDS) crisis.''
   Bernardin said the still-to-be-appointed authors would consult
with the Vatican while writing the new statement.
   In a statement, Bernardin noted that some critics had called for
the original document to be scrapped outright, but said that in his
opinion that would be ``disastrous.''
   ``Withdrawal could give the impression that the entire document
is flawed and that the entire administrative board was in serious
error,'' he said. ``Such action could reopen the debate with
greater intensity.''
   The bishops, he said, cannot allow criticism of the document
``to continue festering. Our unity must be restored so that we can
get on with our business.''
   A Vatican official, in a private letter to the bishops,
criticized the AIDS paper and faulted them for sowing confusion
among Catholics by considering it, a newspaper reported.
   The Milwaukee Sentinel said it obtained a copy of the letter by
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who says bishops should approve use of
condoms under no circumstances and should have consulted the
Vatican. Ratzinger, chief of the Vatican's Congregation for the
Doctrine of Faith, had the comments included in a confidential
booklet prepared for the bishops' study before Monday's session.
   In conclusion, Ratzinger expressed confidence the bishops would
follow ``these considerations, which are known to his Holiness and
have his fullest support.''
   Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland said he was surprised
because the letter marked the first time the conference had
received a private communication from Rome before discussing an
issue.
   In previous business at the four-day conference, the roughly 280
bishops approved a report condemning the morality of deploying a
so-called Star Wars defense initiative but recommending continued
research in the context of disarmament negotiations.
   The bishops also approved a campaign to raise $20 million to
help orders support their retired members.
   Underlying the conference was a larger debate over the role and
authority of the meetings. A recent Vatican working paper said the
U.S. conference and 99 similar conventions around the world have no
authority as a teacher of Catholic doctrine.

<HEAD>Pediatricians' Group Vows To Fight Any Public Advertising Of
Infant Formula</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pediatricians' group said Monday it will fight
any attempt by Carnation to advertise a new infant formula to the
public.
   Richard Narkewicz, president of the 34,000-member American
Academy of Pediatrics, said he has written a letter to Carnation
President Timm F. Crull, saying, ``Any attempt to dissuade mothers
from breast-feeding by advertising infant formula directly to the
public would be strongly condemned by the academy.''
   Infant-formula makers have traditionally refrained from
advertising directly to the public, and the academy's longstanding
policy has been to oppose such advertising, Narkewicz said.
   The academy's opposition stems from its concern that such
product promotion may encourage women to use formula rather than to
breast-feed their infants, Narkewicz said.
   ``Quite frankly,'' Narkewicz said, ``if breast-feeding is the
best, and you've got a multimillion-dollar promotion for formula,
who's going to put up the dough to advertise that breast-feeding is
best? Nobody.''
   At a press conference in New York Monday, Carnation announced
the introduction of an infant formula that the company says will
help some infants who are allergic to existing formulas.
   Carnation spokesman Richard Curd said the company plans an
information campaign to alert the public to the problem of
infant-formula allergies. He said the ads will mention Carnation,
not the new product.
   The formula, called Good Start H.A., is a whey-based,
predigested product that Carnation says will not cause allergies in
some children who are allergic to conventional cow's milk formulas
or formulas made from soybean proteins.
   Dr. Richard Hamburger, a professor of pediatrics at the
University of California, San Diego, who spoke at the press
conference on the company's behalf, said perhaps 8 percent of U.S.
children are allergic to both milk-based and soy-based infant
formulas, the two most commonly used in the United States.
   Some children who are allergic to both kinds of formula _ which
contain whole proteins _ may not be allergic to Good Start H.A.,
which contains proteins that are broken down, said Hamburger.
   Hamburger and Narkewicz both emphasized that breast-feeding is
preferred over the use of infant formula.
   Dr. William Weil, a professor of pediatrics at Michigan State
University and former member of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
nutrition committee, said that as many as 90 percent of children
may have some food disorder at some time, but that formula allergy
is not usually the cause.
   Of the Carnation product, he said, ``It does not sound to me
like they've come up with anything in the way of a breakthrough for
feeding problems in infancy.''
   Adele Haley, a pharmaceutical business securities analyst for
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said Carnation made a ``less than
convincing'' argument that it has a significantly different product.
   Ernie Strapazon, assistant general manager of Carnation's
Nutritional Products Division, said: ``The company has developed an
information campaign for Good Start H.A. targeted at consumers and
focusing on formula intolerance symptoms. The message will direct
consumers to their pediatrician for the solution to problems of
infant formula intolerance caused by cow's milk-based or soy-based
formulas.''
   Narkewicz, a South Burlington, Vt., pediatrician, expressed
concern that the academy's nutrition committee had no opportunity
to examine the product.
   ``When we learn what this formula is, we will have our committee
look at it and see _ does it satisfy the standards,'' Narkewicz
said from Chicago, where he was attending a meeting of the American
Medical Association.
   ``But I'll tell you one thing: We are going to strongly fight
them if they are advertising infant formula directly to the
public.''
   Several Carnation officials, including Crull and Strapazon, were
aboard a plane from New York to Los Angeles and could not be
reached for a response to Narkewicz, said Paulette Barrett of
Edelman Public Relations in New York, the agency that organized the
press conference.

   More than a dozen high-school friends
showed up in court Monday to show support for the 17-year-old
accused of murdering his mother on the day he was supposed to
graduate as class valedictorian.
   William Shrubsall pleaded innocent to second-degree murder
during a brief arraignment. Judge John Mariano ordered him held
without bail and granted an adjournment until Friday.
   His friends, who over the weekend expressed shock and disbelief
that the handsome and popular honors student could have committed
the crime, sat silently in the courtroom and filed out of the
building without talking to reporters.
   Shrubsall had no comment as his attorney, Paul Cleary, entered
the plea.
   Cleary later said the boy was ``heartbroken'' at losing his
mother.
   ``No one, not anyone who knew William, had any inkling that he
could have done this,'' Cleary said.
   Shrubsall is accused of using a baseball bat to crush the skull
of his 56-year-old mother, Marianne, following an argument early
Saturday morning.
   Shrubsall originally told police that someone had broken into
his house and attacked his mother, and that he scared off the
assailant with a kitchen knife. But under questioning he later
confessed to the killing, saying his mother had threatened to call
his girlfriend's parents after he'd returned late from her home.
   Shrubsall also claimed that his mother struck him with the
telephone receiver during the argument. He told police that she
wouldn't allow him any freedom.
   Cleary said Saturday that there was a history of problems
between the mother and son that would come out in court. The two
had lived alone since the death of Shrubsall's father in 1985.
   One report said that Mrs. Shrubsall beat the teen-ager on
previous occasions. But police said Monday those reports were ``too
strong.''
   Shrubsall, first out of 250 students at LaSalle High School in
Niagara Falls, was to attend the University of Chicago in the fall
and study pre-law.

   Jesse Jackson said Monday he is pleased
with many of the domestic provisions in the Democratic Party
platform, but hinted that some foreign policy issues _ the
Palestinian question in particular _ may be contested.
   He said he is weighing a dozen possible issues that were left
out of the platform to bring up at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta next month.
   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in the
platform,'' Jackson said at a news conference at the annual
convention of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded.
``And we protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues
in Atlanta.''
   His comments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver and
Washington over the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and an
overhaul of party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.
   Jackson indicated that a call for the creation of a Palestinian
homeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusion in the
platform _ might well be an issue at the convention.
   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate
anyone,'' he said when asked whether such a plank might anger Jews.
``We must put forth a formula that represents security for Israel
and justice for Palestine, and peace for both.''
   He declined to name the other issues his camp might bring to the
floor.
   Jackson also continued to put himself forth as the one who most
deserves to be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket with
Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson said no senator or governor has achieved his broad base
of support, and ``no Democrat alive has registered as many voters
as I have.''
   On the platform, Jackson took credit for getting a number of
issues into the document, including a call for a comprehensive
anti-drug effort, a plank calling for designation of South Africa
as a ``terrorist state,'' and a program of Third World development.

   Worries about whether Israel and South
Africa have nuclear weapons contributed to the lack of agreement on
disarmament policy at a monthlong special General Assembly session,
a U.N. official said Monday.
   Yasushi Akashi, U.N. undersecretary-general for disarmament
affairs, told reporters ``the United Nations did not fail. ... The
membership failed the United Nations.''
   ``I think it is a temporary setback, but ... it should be looked
at in the overall context of the continuous process of the United
Nations to identify and broaden the areas of common interest in
multilateral disarmament,'' Akashi said.
   Delegates to the special session debated throughout last week
and into Sunday morning on disarmament issues.
   The main difference at the session, which ended Sunday, was
between sweeping disarmament proposals advanced by the Soviet Union
and developing nations, and more cautious suggestions of the United
States and some of its Western allies.
   By Sunday morning, delegates had given up trying to write a
mutually acceptable document and the session adjourned.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Monday: ``Member
states came close to a final agreement on most of the provisions. .
.. In the end, however, basic national positions were not amenable
to a compromise text.''
   The 159-member General Assembly has no power to enforce its
decisions, but delegates said they believed a final resolution
adopted by consensus would have carried moral authority.
   Akashi said fears among African nations that South Africa was
developing nuclear weapons were partly responsible for the lack of
consensus, as were similar concerns of Arab nations about Israel.
   Non-aligned nations were said to have favored identifying Israel
and South Africa as regionl offenders in a final document.
   The Iran-Iraq war, allegations that Iraq has been using chemical
weapons, and ``the scope of the secretary-general's role in the
investigation of the alleged use of chemical weapons'' created
another obstacle, he said. Iran and Iraq have been at war since
September 1980.
   Another of the ``thorny areas'' involved India and Pakistan,
which regularly accuse each other of developing nuclear weapons, he
said. Neither has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   One question about the treaty is whether developing nations have
a duty to sign it before the United States and Soviet Union reduce
their huge nuclear arsenals, he said.
   As another sticking point, Akashi mentioned ``concerns of the
major powers for their military and strategic positions.''
   Reports at the conference indicated U.S. delegates argued in
committee against naval disarmament, a nuclear test ban and
proposals that would affect the U.S. space-based defense system
commonly called ``Star Wars.''
   Other issues dividing delegates were nuclear-free zones and
militarization of outer space, Akashi said.
   He declared the session successful, despite the lack of
consensus, on grounds that prepared the way for progress on arms
control at the regular General Assembly session this fall.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Calls in Soviet Ambassador To Discuss Spy
Squabble</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New grafs 1-9 UPDATE with Clark and Soviet ambassador
meeting, Clark threatening new sanction. Picks up 8th graf pvs The

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A diplomatic row which began with Canada's
expulsion of purported Soviet spies cooled down Monday when Foreign
Minister Joe Clark called Soviet Ambassador Alexei Rodionov into
his office for a 25-minute chat.
   Rodionov emerged from the meeting and told reporters he was
satisfied the misunderstanding was over.
   But Clark, who postponed an Asian trip Monday to meet with
Rodionov, said when asked if there was a truce: ``I wouldn't apply
that term at this stage.''
   And, after 32 Soviet and Canadian diplomats and officials were
either expelled or prohibited from re-entry, Clark announced one
final sanction.
   He said Soviet workers coming to Montreal to rebuild the
fire-damaged Soviet consulate may not get visas unless the Kremlin
rescinds its decision to withdraw 25 Soviet citizens from their
jobs at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow.
   Visas will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis as long as Moscow
insists on limiting Soviet staff at the embassy, the foreign
minister said.
   The mild threat appeared a face-saving gesture, however, as the
Soviets had pledged to retaliate again and again until Canada
backed off.
   Since Tuesday, Canada has expelled or barred 19 Soviet diplomats
and officials for purported military and commercial espionage. The
Kremlin retaliated with action against 13 Canadian diplomats, three
of whom are accused of military espionage.
   The Soviets shot their last volley on Saturday, damaging
Canadian diplomatic operations in Moscow even further by
withdrawing 25 of the 39 Soviet citizens who cook, clean and do
clerical tasks at the Canadian Embassy.
   The government has given no details of the alleged Soviet
espionage, except to say Moscow tried to infiltrate Canadian
security agencies.
   Intelligence sources told The Associated Press the Soviets were
after highly classified U.S. naval secrets and technology from a
Montreal electronics plant making communications and guidance
systems for a new generation of Canadian frigates and from the U.S.
submarine-monitoring base at Argentia, Newfoundland.
   Clark said he remained confident Canadian security was not
breached by the Soviet activities.
   He had been due to leave Monday for bilateral talks in Tokyo,
followed by a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
in Thailand. He is now likely to leave Wednesday, officials said.

<HEAD>Heavy Rains Fall on Texas; Record Highs and Record Lows Set</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both record highs and lows were set for the date across the
nation, while thunderstorms continued to produce heavy rain in
portions of Texas on Monday.
   Cars stalled as streets flooded in Odessa, Texas, and a flash
flood watch was posted for parts of northwest Texas. Two inches of
rain fell in that region.
   A flash flood watch also was posdted in Apache County in the
northeast corner of Arizona, where heavy thunderstorms were
forecast on top of previous heavy rain during recent days.
   Scattered thunderstorms developed from South Carolina across
Florida and the Gulf Coast states to southeastern Texas.
Thunderstorms also developed in the Rockies.
   Unseasonably cool air began to move into western Washington on
Monday afternoon, and freezing levels are expected to lower to
between 4,000 and 5,000 feet by midweek. Snow accumulations may
occur in portions of the Cascade and Olympic mountain ranges.
   Pleasantly cool temperatures prevailed Monday afternoon from the
Carolinas to New England and from the Appalachians to the upper and
middle Mississippi Valley. Readings in these areas were mostly in
the 70s to lower 80s.
   In contrast, temperatures reached 100 degrees and set record
highs in portions of the central Gulf Coast region and the northern
Plains. The desert southwest also saw triple-digit readings.
   Record low temperatures for the date were set at Jackson, Mich.,
(44 degrees); Parkersburg, W.Va., (49); and Toledo, Ohio, (45).
   Record highs for the date were marked at Bismarck, N.D. (102
degrees); Meridian, Miss. (102); and Pensacola, Fla. (101).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Everett, Wash., to 105 at Phoenix, Ariz. The nation's
low Monday morning was 37 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The National Weather Service forecast Tuesday called for
scattered showers and thunderstorms extending from the Rockies
across western portions of the central Plains, Oklahoma, Texas and
along the Gulf Coast region to Florida.
   Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be most numerous in
central Florida and from the Texas Panhandle to eastern Colorado.
Widely scattered showers were forecast in Washington, in Oregon and
along the Canadian border from Minnesota to Maine.
   Most of the nation should have high temperatures in the 80s or
90s. Highs were forecast in the upper 60s and 70s in the northern
Great Lakes and from the upper Ohio Valley to the northern Middle
Atlantic States, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Temperatures
were expected to reach 100 to 110 degrees across the desert
southwest.

   The man charged with lying to a grand jury about
bugging the conversations of Tawana Brawley's advisers was jailed
overnight without bail pending another detention hearing Tuesday.
   Federal prosecutors claimed Samuel McClease's checkered military
and employment records made him a poor candidate for release on
bail.
   U.S. Magistrate James C. Francis IV had disagreed, ordering
McClease released on $100,000 unsecured bond. But prosecutors
appealed the ruling to a higher court and U.S. District Judge
Shirley Wohl Kram delayed releasing McClease pending a bail hearing
Tuesday morning.
   McClease, 26, claimed last week that he had taped conversations
of the Rev. Al Sharpton and two legal advisers to the Brawley
family _ casting doubt on the Dutchess County teen-ager's tale of
being sexual assaulted by six white men.
   But McClease, a self-proclaimed surveillance expert, was charged
Saturday with one count each of obstruction of justice and perjury
after it was revealed the tapes he turned over to authorities were
blank.
   McClease, of Jersey City, N.J., claimed that Sharpton had hired
him to bug conversations involving the two Brawley lawyers, C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox.
   McClease said during an interview broadcast June 20 on WCBS-TV
that Sharpton hired him in February to plant voice-activated
listening devices in Mason's home and office and in Sharpton's own
home.
   In the interview, McClease said the tapes revealed that there
was no evidence to support the black teen-ager's contentions that
she was abducted by a gang of white men and raped repeatedly last
November _ and that the advisers knew this.
   But prosecutors announced Saturday that FBI analysis indicated
the tapes McClease turned over were ``completely blank.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who moved into
the congressional forefront over the past three years in the
Democratic drive to sharpen the nation's edge in global trade, is
once again in the spotlight as Michael Dukakis mulls over his vice
presidential options.
   A Southwestern conservative, a Protestant, a Washington insider
_ Bentsen chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee, a record on
defense that is hawkish but not stridently so _ what more could
likely Democratic nominee Dukakis ask if a balanced ticket is his
goal for the fall campaign?
   No Democrat has been elected president in this century without
carrying Texas, and Bentsen would be a formidable opponent in one
of the states all-but-certain Republican nominee George Bush calls
home.
   In fact, the Texas senator knows all about defeating Bush _ he
did it in the 1970 senate race.
   Bentsen, an elegantly tailored, silver-haired patrician, is the
scion of a wealthy landed family from the Rio Grande Valley. He
used to tool around Capitol Hill in a cream-colored Mercedes-Benz
convertible, which he has since sold.
   Friends describe Bentsen's way with a speech as ``not
incendiary.'' Actually, his carefully qualified, never overstated
commentaries on the nation's foreign trade outlook have been known
to draw yawns and glazed eyes.
   Bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the Democratic presidential
nomination but excited little interest. In 1984, he was on
Democratic nominee Walter Mondale's list of possible running mates
_ one of the few white males in a field that included former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and eventual pick Geraldine
Ferraro.
   On the negative side, Bentsen created a furor in February 1987
when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay $10,000
apiece to join him for breakfast once a month.
   The breakfast club, called the ``Chairman's Council,'' held one
meeting and was quickly disbanded with Bentsen promising to return
the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists.
   Bentsen was born Feb. 11, 1921, in Mission, Texas, the son of
``Big Lloyd'' Bentsen, who migrated to the Rio Grande Valley after
World War I and made himself wealthy as a rancher and by buying
land and reselling it, largely to Midwest farmers who wanted to
become citrus producers.
   He received a law degree from the University of Texas in 1942
and joined the Army Air Corps, earning his pilot's wings and flying
bomber missions over the Third Reich. He served as a Hidalgo
County, Texas, judge from 1946 through 1948, when he was elected to
the U.S. House.
   Bentsen was a member of the House until 1955, when he retired to
go into business and enhance his family's fortunes. He took over
the operation of a small insurance company and transformed it into
a financial holding company, increasing its size several times in
the process.
   He also kept his hand in Texas politics, serving as state
finance chairman for Lyndon B. Johnson's campaigns. Content with
his business achievements, Bentsen reentered politics in 1970,
defeating liberal incumbent Ralph Yarborough in the primary and
broadening his appeal in the general election to defeat Bush.
   Bentsen could be of as much value off the ticket as on it. He is
up for re-election this year and his much-vaunted organization
could make Dukakis competitive in Texas if Bentsen leads the state
office ticket.
   As Finance Committee chairman, Bentsen presides over tax and
trade legislation and this year was sponsor of a catastrophic
health insurance bill.
   Record trade deficits in recent years combined with layoffs
caused by import competition and resulting congressional ferment
have put the focus on Bentsen. Voluntary restraints on Japanese
auto shipments to the United States were imposed after he and Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., offered legislation that would have made
import curbs mandatory.
   The bill was largely a gesture on their part and Bentsen has
most often been a critic of protectionism, although in 1984 he did
vote in favor of legislation to roll back Asian textile imports.
But he staunchly opposed Missouri Rep. Richard A. Gephardt's plan
to force reductions in Japanese trade surpluses with the United
States and similar if less sharply spotlighted proposals.
   Instead, he pushed for legislation that would leave the
administration more flexibility to grapple with the nation's trade
problems.
   As a Texas lawmaker, Bentsen also has been in the forefront of
the fight to repeal the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry
earnings and to obtain other benefits for the home-state industry.

   A strong earthquake shook a wide area of
Northern California Monday, making skyscrapers sway and dumping
cans and bottles from supermarket shelves, but causing no injuries
or serious damage.
   The quake, initially reported near 5.0 on the Richter scale by
several agencies, was upgraded to 5.7 by the University of
California seismographic stations at Berkeley, although other
scientists kept to the lower figure. A quake of that magnitude can
cause considerable damage in populated areas.
   ``All of a sudden there was this big noise,'' said clerk Judy
Young at a 7-Eleven convenience store at Scotts Valley. ``Stuff
fell off the shelves. A lot of stuff fell. A couple of people had
just left when it hit. They were thrown up against the outside
wall. I thought they were fighting.''
   The quake, which hit at 11:43 a.m. PDT, was one of the strongest
quakes along the San Andreas Fault since the 1906 temblor that
destroyed much of San Francisco, according to Robert Uhrhammer at
the University of California, Berkeley. The San Andreas Fault, the
longest beneath the state, annually produces dozens of quakes along
its 650-mile length.
   U.S. Geological Survey spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said the
epicenter was about 16 miles south of San Jose.
   The quake was felt over a large area, extending from Santa Rosa,
about 60 miles north of San Francisco, to the Monterey Peninsula
about 100 miles to the south. It lasted up to 10 seconds in many
areas.
   Although Berkeley scientists upgraded their magnitude, other
agencies stuck by their lower estimate.
   ``From our point of view, it looks like 5.0 is a better
(estimated) magnitude,'' said geophysicist Willis Jacobs, of the
U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo. The agency's Menlo Park office also measured the
quake at 5.0.
   Office workers in San Francisco skyscrapers took the quake
pretty much in stride. In the landmark 48-story Transamerica
pyramid building, constructed to withstand far more powerful
temblors, workers said there was no sense of panic.
   ``We just all kind of stood around and laughed,'' said
Montgomery Securities administrator Racine Linville from the 46th
floor. ``It wasn't so much the swaying sensation as it was you
could tell there were two big jolts.''
   Ginger Johnson, a receptionist for Montgomery Securities on the
21st floor, said, ``Our traders immediately started betting on how
big it was.''
   The 38 trains that were running on Bay Area Rapid Transit lines
were briefly halted to allow a check for track damage, but were
quickly returned to operation.
   Southern Pacific halted freight trains and San Francisco
Peninsula commuter trains under a company policy requiring a check
of track following a quake of 5.0 or greater.
   At the 20-story federal building in San Francisco, attorney
Anthony Smith was making his closing argument to a jury when the
quake hit.
   ``As you can see, my argument is reaching the powers that be,''
Smith told the jurors, according to associate Reid Dworkin, who was
in the courtroom. He said a couple of spectators rushed out and
U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen stopped the trial briefly.
   Tommy Anderson, a U.S. Marshal's office employee on the 20th
floor of the federal building, said he was ``looking out the window
at City Hall. I could see the building move in relation to other
buildings.''
   Walt Glines, news editor of The Dispatch in Gilroy, about 25
miles east of Santa Cruz, said half the workers in that newspaper's
city room ``didn't even notice'' the quake, which seemed to hit in
two waves.
   ``The first time, I thought it was a caffeine rush. But when the
second one hit, I knew,'' he said.
   At International Business Machines Corp. in South San Jose,
officials told workers to get under their desks for protection.
   ``We felt it extremely hard,'' said plant operator Brenda Jones.
``It was a very heavy shake. Everything just rocked very heavily.''
   She said officials checked the buildings for cracks or other
damage but found no immediate problems.
   On Sunday, an earthquake measuring 4.5 to 4.7 on the Richter
scale shook a wide area of Southern California, including downtown
Los Angeles, but no serious damage was reported. At least four
people were treated for minor injuries.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Each increase of one number means the ground motion was 10 times
greater.

   Pope John Paul II ended his
controversial Austrian tour Monday with warm thanks to President
Kurt Waldheim. A news report said a new plot by Turkish extremists
to assassinate the pontiff was foiled in Vienna.
   On May 13, 1981, a Turkish terrorist shot and badly wounded the
pope in St. Peter's Square in Rome.
   ABC News in New York quoted unidentified sources as saying two
Turkish extremists were the prime suspects in the latest
assassination plot. In its 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday newscast, ABC said
the attempt was to take place last Thursday, and that police
believed the gunfire was to come from a construction site across
from a cathedral where the pope said Mass.
   The Austrian government confirmed that Austrian anti-terrorist
police found photographs ``that show several sniper positions in
the building plus firing angles to the square'' in front of St.
Stephen's Cathedral, according to ABC.
   The network said that a police raid at an Islamic prayer
building used mainly by Turkish immigrants apparently foiled the
plot.
   ABC said that Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who shot the pope in
1981, and other members of a right-wing extremist group in Turkey
called the Gray Wolves, from time to time sought sanctuary in the
Turkish quarter in Vienna. Agca is serving a life term in a prison
in Rome.
   The pope's tour ended without incident.
   Leo Lauber, overnight police supervisor in Vienna, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview shortly after 3 a.m.
Tuesday (9 p.m. EDT Monday): ``I don't know anything about this. I
don't know anything about two Turks being prime suspects in such a
plot.''
   Lauber added that any such information, if in fact it exists,
would only be available once the police day shift comes on duty
Tuesday morning.
   Hans Schengersbauer, overnight supervisor at the Interior
Ministry in Vienna, told the AP: ``I haven`t heard of any such
thing. That sounds like a made-up story to me.'' The Interior
Ministry oversees many police and security functions in Austria.
   Schengersbauer said that he had not been informed of every
detail of the papal visit, but that as far as he knew it went off
without incident.
   ``Surely, if something like that had happened, it would have
come out in the news media before,'' he said.
   In Ankara, the Turkish capital, overnight duty officers at the
Interior Ministry and the state security department told the AP
they had no information on any such plot.
   In Rome, repeated telephone calls to the Vatican press office
and the home of Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro were unanswered.
   On his last day in Austria, John Paul spoke against ``bitter
confrontations'' that cause divisions in Christianity and the
church.
   Some Jewish leaders objected to his meetings with Waldheim, who
has been accused of involvement in war crimes while serving as a
German army officer in World War II. He denies wrongdoing.
   A looming schism prompted by activities of traditionalist French
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, which would be the first split in the
Roman Catholic Church for more than a century, is one of several
items awaiting John Paul at the Vatican.
   He is to elevate 24 new cardinals Tuesday and will announce a
major reform of the curia, the church administration. The
68-year-old pontiff ended his five-day visit at Innsbruck, site of
the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics.
   Standing on the airport runway, he thanked Waldheim for ``your
kind words of farewell and for the warm and generous hospitality
which your country and its people have again extended to me,'' then
added:
   ``Cherish and deepen above all the great good of unity and of
the common profession of faith in sincerity and mutual love.''
   During his second trip to this predominantly Catholic nation of
7.5 million people, John Paul repeatedly emphasized that Christians
as well as Jews suffered at Nazi hands.
   Recalling another part of his trip, the pontiff also said Monday
he was ``especially happy'' tens of thousands of East European
Catholics were able to attend his Masses in Austria. Most were from
Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   He has been permitted to visit his native Poland, but not the
other communist-ruled nations of Europe.
   Waldheim also mentioned the Nazi past in his parting remarks.
   ``The somber walls of the concentration camp of Mauthausen
forcefully remind us of the martyrs of our own time,'' Waldheim
said of the concentration camp the pontiff visited Friday. He
called the walls ``relics of a shameful period of our century.''
   A light rain fell as two talked, and when the shower had passed
a rainbow colored the sky. The pontiff's red-and-white Austrian
Airlines DC-9 left for Rome at 6:57 p.m., threading its way through
the craggy, snow-covered Tyrolean peaks.
   John Paul drew repeated lessons from the Nazi horrors during his
tour, beginning with mention of the ``burdensome legacy of the
past'' during a meeting with Waldheim soon after he arrived.
   Waldheim, 69, was U.N. secretary-general from 1972 to 1982 and
allegations about his wartime activities arose during the
presidential campaign two years ago.
   An international panel of historians appointed by the Austrian
government concluded that he knew of Nazi atrocities while serving
as a German officer in the Balkans and did nothing to stop them,
but its report left open the question of personal guilt.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 farmers, enraged over a bill
to ban coca leaf growing, attacked a police and U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency base Monday and blocked roads in clashes that
killed at least six farmers, officials said.
   Bolivian anti-drug police first fired into the air, but then
fired at the crowd after the farmers continued to march on the base
at Villa Tunari, 180 miles east of the capital city of La Paz,
authorities reported.
   Jorge Alderrete, undersecrtary for the Ministry of Interior,
said some protesters carried dynamite sticks and rifles.
   Five DEA agents were at the base but did not take part in the
fighting and were not hurt, said James Danbridge, spokesman for the
U.S. Embassy in La Paz.
   The takeover attempt failed.
   Police said scores of people were injured in other protests in
the Chapare, a lush tropical region in the heart of Bolivia where
80 percent of Bolivian cocaine is produced.
   Julio Rocha, head of the Chapare Coca Leaf Growers Federation,
said farmers tried to take over the base peacefully and were
repelled by armed police. He said DEA agents helped break up the
roadblocks.
   Two cocaine traffickers who were being detained at the base fled
during the attack, said Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran.
   Duran said a camp of a development program in the Chapare
financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development was
overrun by coca leaf farmers. There were no U.S. personnel at the
development camp when the attack occurred. The farmers later were
driven away.
   Duran reported that 100 police were being sent in to the Chapare
to reinforce the 300 troops based there.
   A reporter for Radio Panamericana said he saw DEA agents and
Bolivian police fire tear gas at farmers who blocked the bridge and
the main road through the Chapare. Huey helicopters on loan from
the U.S. government also fired tear gas at farmers who were on the
road and bridge, he said.
   Bolivia mobilized the special anti-drug police based in the
Chapare to keep roads open and disperse crowds. At least 350,000
farmers, most of whom live off coca leaf growing and cocaine
processing, live in the Chapare, an area about as big as New Jersey.
   There are an estimated 40 U.S. troops, DEA people and U.S.
Border Patrol agents assisting Bolivian police in the Chapare. The
Americans will remain in the area despite the confrontations, said
Danbridge.
   In recent weeks coca leaf farmers have staged protest marches
and threatened roadblocks and confrontations if the Bolivian
Congress goes ahead with an anti-narcotics measure that would
declare illegal most coca leaf cultivations in the Chapare.
   Congress is expected to pass the bill this week. Part of the
U.S. government's aid program to Bolivia is contingent on the
bill's becoming law.
   There are nearly 100,000 acres of coca plantations in Bolivia
which produce 90 metric tons of cocaine a year, a U.S. Embassy
report says.
   A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds, or 1.1 short tons.
   Bolivia has intensified its interdiction efforts in the Chapare
this year and captured five tons of cocaine paste, police say.

<HEAD>Securities Analyst Allegedly Made $19 Million in Insider Trading</HEAD>

   A 24-year-old junior securities analyst for
Morgan Stanley & Co. was accused Monday along with a Hong Kong
businessman of making $19 million in illegal profits in an insider
trading scheme.
   An official of the Securities and Exchange Commission said it
was the second largest insider trading case the agency has handled.
   The SEC filed a civil complaint against Stephen Wang Jr. of New
York City, an analyst in Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions
department. Also named in the complaint was Fred. C. Lee, a Hong
Kong businessman who allegedly traded on the information supplied
by Wang.
   The complaint, filed in federal court in New York, asked for the
return of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple that
amount in damages.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case is
surpassed only by the insider trading case involving Ivan Boesky,
who agreed to return $100 million in profits to settle charges
brought by the SEC in November 1986.
   The SEC complaint said Wang was able to obtain information on
company takeovers being handled by Morgan Stanley. The complaint
said he provided this information to Lee, who then bought stock
before the public announcement of various takeovers drove up the
price of that stock.
   The SEC said Lee realized more than $19 million in profits when
the prices of the various securities increased after public
announcements
   The complaint said Lee had transferred to Wang ``at least
$200,000.''
   Wang had been with Morgan Stanley for two years and had been in
the mergers and acquisition division for one year, Lynch said in an
interview.
   Morgan Stanley said in a brief statement that it had suspended
Wang pending an investigation. A source at Morgan Stanley who spoke
on condition of anonymity said the firm had been cooperating with
SEC officials for some time in connection with Wang's activities.
   Wang was a junior analyst on a two-year training program for
college graduates, the source said. He was only a few days away
from the July 1 completion of the program when the SEC announced
its action against him.
   Investigators alleged in the complaint that Lee, 38, had
attempted to move money out of the United States and for that
reason funds in bank accounts should be frozen. Lee was described
as an international businessman with interest in real estate,
import-export operations and public utilities. A citizen of Taiwan,
Lee was said to also have a home in McLean, Va., an exclusive
Washington suburb.
   Lynch said investigators are alleging that the trading on inside
information began in July 1987 and involved stock in about 25
different companies, including E.F. Hutton, Stop & Shop Cos., Utah
Power & Light Co. and Impact Systems.
   ``From at least July 1987 through at least April 1988, Lee
placed long-distance telephone calls from McLean, Va., Hong Kong
and elsewhere to Wang at his home and office in New York,'' the
complaint said. ``During these telephone calls, Wang improperly
disclosed to Lee the material, non-public information.''
   The complaint said Lee made $3 million in profits by trading the
stock of Stop & Shop; $1.2 million in profits on the stock of E.F.
Hutton; and $840,000 in profits on Utah Power.
   The SEC said other companies whose stocks were traded by Lee
based on information obtained from Wang were American Standard
Inc.; American Brands Inc.; Catalyst Energy Corp.; Chi-Chi's Inc.;
Dayton Hudson Corp.; the Dime Savings Bank of New York; E-II
Holdings Inc.; Federated Department Stores; Firestone Tire &
Rubber; Gillete Co.; IC Industries Inc.; Kerr McGee Corp.;
Lymphomed Inc.; Manpower Inc.; Outboard Marine Corp.; Richmond Hill
Savings Bank; Sabine Corp.; Safecard Services Inc.; Savannah
Electric & Power Co.; Staley Continental Inc.; and Stanadyne Inc.
   The complaint said Lee had at first denied even knowing Wang
during interviews with an SEC attorney in Hong Kong last Thursday
and Friday. However, the SEC said he decided to change his
testimony midway through the second day of questioning and admit to
using information supplied by Wang to profit from stocks, according
to court documents supplied by the SEC.

<HEAD>Israeli Official Wants New Missile With US Help</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs to bottom with Carlucci comment at dinner with
Rabin</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
Monday he expects the Reagan administration to approve joint
development with Israel of a new surface-to-air missile, to counter
a threat posed by the supply of Soviet and Chinese missiles to Arab
countries.
   ``We have to be capable to cope with this new threat,'' Rabin
said after a meeting at the White House with senior Reagan
administration officials.
   He said Israel could not stop the Soviet Union and China from
supplying the missiles to Arab foes, and that U.S. efforts to
persuade them to stop had also failed.
   As a result, Rabin said, he had urged the administration to
approve joint production and development of the ``Arrow'' missile
as a countermeasure.
   ``There wasn't agreement in the past about the Arrow program,''
the Israeli official told reporters after meeting with Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser.
   But, Rabin said, ``I hope everything will be circled by
tomorrow.''
   The Soviet Union has moved closer to resuming diplomatic ties
with Israel, and has improved its relations with the United States.
Even so, Rabin said, the Soviets supplied missiles to Syria, Iraq
and Libya while China sold a new missile to Saudi Arabia.
   ``For us it's a new strategic threat,'' Rabin said. He cited
also the use of chemical weapons by Iran and Iraq ``and the
legitimization'' given this kind of warfare.
   ``I brought up all these issues, the ways that we, as Israelis,
would like to cope with it, and to find out to what extent certain
projects in which we agreed in the past can get more impetus
towards the future,'' he said.
   In past wars, he said, the Arab nations' air forces could not
penetrate Israeli air defenses and reach population centers.
``Missiles can reach, and no doubt the situation can be aggravated
if chemical war will be added to the missiles,'' Rabin said.
   ``We first would like to be in a position to have the capability
to defend the population of Israel, the armed forces of Israel and
then to destroy the means that might threaten Israel once a war
starts,'' he said.
   The Israeli official is on a semiannual visit to Washington to
develop the strategic ties that bind the United States with its
leading Middle Eastern ally.
   On the human rights situation on the West Bank, which is also on
the agenda for Rabin's visit, Carlucci said, ``We did have some
discussions on disturbances taking place and the Israelis are very
much aware of our position.''
   That is, Carlucci said, ``We do not support beatings or
deportations, but we do recognize that the Israelis have a security
responsibility on the West Bank.''
   Rabin, as defense minister, is trying to control the volatile
situation in the West Bank and Gaza, where Palestinian Arabs have
demonstrated against Israeli control since last December.
   Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights, has criticized Israel for what Schifter called ``clear
human rights violations,'' and called for a new system of reviewing
appeals by Palestinians who claim they were mistreated by Israeli
soldiers.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman disputed, however,
reports that Schifter is urging joint U.S.-Israeli monitoring of
the situation in the territories.
   Redman said a ``channel of communication'' between the two
countries was what Schifter had proposed.
   In the meantime, the Palestine Liberation Organization, with
strong Arab support, has promoted an ``uprising'' on the West Bank
and in Gaza to try to wrest the area from Israeli control.
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, oil-rich countries in the Persian Gulf,
have committed themselves to contribute $50 million to the PLO
treasury to keep the unrest going, Palestinian representatives
reported Saturday in Beirut, Lebanon.
   Rabin and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres both supported
Shultz's attempt to arrange a peace conference that would be aimed
also at Arab recognition of Israel. But Shamir refused to provide
the assurances sought by Jordan's King Hussein through Shultz that
Israel would surrender the West Bank and Gaza.
   Rabin is seeing Carlucci and President Reagan and congressional
leaders on Tuesday.
   Carlucci, at a dinner for Rabin on Monday night at Fort McNair,
said, ``We think of ourselves as your partners. We have a common
sense of purpose.''
   The U.S. defense secretary, mindful of the November presidential
elections, said, ``This country, no matter what administration is
in power, will always be a friend and supporter of Israel.''

<HEAD>Court Puts Off Date for Duvalier Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THIERRY BOINET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ A French court on Monday put off
until a later date Haiti's legal efforts to recover $120 million
allegedly taken by dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier when he fled to
France, a court official said.
   The official, who was not identified in keeping with French
practice, said an investigating magistrate will be named to
determine a new hearing date after consulting lawyers for the
Haitian government and Duvalier.
   Duvalier, who fled here during anti-government demonstrations in
April 1986, is accused of misappropriating at least $120 million in
public funds.
   Attorney Yann Colin, representing the Haitian goverment, told
reporters that Gen. Henri Namphy's seizure of power June 20 in
Haiti would not interrupt the judicial procedure begun in France by
Haiti.
   ``We are not the lawyers of the government but of the state of
Haiti,'' Colin said. ``We maintain our power as its legal
representative.''
   In April, a French court ruled it had juridsiction in the case
against Duvalier.
   According to judicial sources, who by practice cannot be
identified, a household budget sheet seized during the course of
the investigation, shows that Duvalier and his wife, Michele,
continue to enjoy a comfortable life style.
   The sources said the information could undermine the Duvaliers'
lawyer's claim that the couple left all their money in Haiti and do
not have any funds elsewhere to spend.
   According to the budget sheet, Mrs. Duvalier spent $5,000 on
Nov. 27 for sweaters for her husband, referred to as ``Tonton'' in
the accounts, which in familiar French means uncle.
   Another entry shows $5,600 for a dress and $1,300 for shoes for
the couple's two children.
   According to the accounts, in some months the couple's
expenditures are substantial. There are unexplained entries in
December 1987 for $287,000 and $28,000.
   The sources said the accounts are quite detailed and show that
Mrs. Duvalier kept a separate ledger for herself. They show that
from July 1987 to January 1988 she spent $83,000 on jewelry.
   Mrs. Duvalier, according to the accounts, is also apparently
responsible for the day-to-day running of the house, paying gas,
telephone and electricty bills.
   For example, she paid out $3,314 in international telephone
calls and $1,060 in local telephone calls in November 1987.
   Many of these expenditures, the accounts show, were made in cash.
   But there were other notations showing that Mrs. Duvalier
transferred funds to relatives apparently to make purchases for the
couple.
   Since arriving in France on Feb. 7, 1986, Duvalier, his wife and
other family members have lived in a mansion in southern France
rented from Saudi businessman Adnan Kashoggi.
   Duvalier has consistently declined to coment on political
developments in Haiti since his downfall. He has said he is without
resources.

   Barge traffic moved again Monday on most of the sandbar-clogged
Mississippi but there were new blockages as barges ran aground in
low water, and even heavy thunderstorms in parts of the South
didn't alleviate the worst drought since Dust Bowl days.
   ``It's been refreshing and it's helped, but we need more to end
the drought,'' said Danny Cooper, director of the Alabama Emergency
Management Agency.
   The drought also will spoil some Fourth of July plans for
fireworks in at least two states.
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson announced he planned to issue
an executive order Tuesday banning fireworks, open fires and even
sparklers because of tinder-dry conditions. He said the ban is
necessary because of the threat of accidental forest, grass and
brush fires and the potential for loss of lives.
   Iowa fire officials also said they are worrying about hot embers
from sky rockets touching off fires, and some fireworks displays
have been called off.
   After more than a week of record heat from the Plains to the
Ohio Valley _ blamed for at least 11 deaths _ cool air washed down
across the Great Lakes and Monday morning was marked by a few
record lows: 44 at Jackson, Mich.; 49 at Parkersburg, W.Va.; and 45
at Toledo, Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   Hot air did edge its way back onto the northern Plains on Monday
with a record 102 at Bismarck, N.D., and a record-tying 100 at
Rapid City, S.D. Far to the south, Meridian, Miss., hit a record
102 and Pensacola, Fla., had a record 101.
   By contrast, the weather service in Seattle warned people
planning to be in the higher elevations of the Olympic and Cascade
mountains to watch for snow and freezing temperatures with the
arrival of cold air from the Gulf of Alaska.
   Showers and thunderstorms supplied moisture Monday morning
across the southern states from the Carolinas into New Mexico,
including 2.21 inches in just three hours at Ira, Texas, the
weather service said.
   On Sunday, thunderstorms and showers were scattered from the
Southeast into the southern Plains with as much as 3.75 inches at
Dothan, Ala. Some of those storms had damaging wind, lightning and
hail, and five people were killed.
   In Oklahoma, ``the rainfall has been enough to ease the drought,
but it's not broken,'' said weather service meteorologist Gary
Szatkowski. Eastern sections normally have 20 to 25 inches of rain
by this time of year ``but some haven't gotten 10 inches yet.''
   Leakey, Texas, west of San Antonio, got that 10 inches in four
days over the weekend ``but if we don't continue to have more
during the rest of the summer, we will be looking at a very bad
fall,'' said Betty Sansom, who lives on a ranch north of Leakey.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus made a whirlwind helicopter tour of
drought-stricken timber and agricultural operations Monday and said
the damage was ``more devastating than I thought it would be.'' He
said the Mississippi River ``looks like a stream flowing through
the desert.
   The scientist who popularized the ``greenhouse effect'' theory
believes the drought is not a symptom of the gradual warming of the
atmosphere he predicted as a result of air pollution, even though
he ``would love to be able to say, `I told you so.'''
   Stephen Schneider, who heads the climate systems unit of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., said
Sunday he believes the drought more likely has been caused by the
jet stream swinging well north of its usual track.
   This year, ``The jet stream jumped north to Canada, depriving
the middle of the country of rain, leaving hot weather in the South
and lowering watersheds further.''
   On the Mississippi River, 20 feet below normal at some points
because of the drought, barge traffic moved again Monday after the
Army Corps of Engineers dredged out channels near St. Louis, Mo.,
and Memphis, Tenn.
   ``There are problems on the river, but they are manageable.
We'll keep it open,'' said Robert Page, assistant secretary of the
Army for civil works.
   Three tows of barges ran aground Monday in the Memphis area,
stopping small groups of tows which will have to wait for the
roadblock to be removed, said Coast Guard Lt. Richard Muth. Such
groundings can occur even in good conditions in the ever-shifting
river.
   The Corps of Engineers said Monday it will keep traffic moving
on the Ohio River for the next 60 to 80 days, even if there is no
rain, thanks to its system of locks and dams and water released
from flood control reservoirs, though barges will have to carry
lighter loads,
   ``It's like the reverse of flood control,'' said Col. Richard.
W. Anderchat, deputy commander of the Corps. ``If it weren't for
the dams, there wouldn't be a single barge moving between Cairo,
Ill., and Pittsburgh.''
   On the dry northern Plains, fire lines were completed Monday
around a fire along the Montana-South Dakota border which grew by
20,000 acres Sunday to a total of 57,000 when it was hit by wind up
to 45 mph.
   ``We're just seeing what happens right now,'' fire information
officer Jack Kendley said Monday evening as firefighters appeared
to gain the upper hand. ``We're strengthening the fire line, and
then the long process of mopping this thing up will begin.''
   However, fire officials shied from describing the blaze as
``contained.''
   Smaller fires were fought in dry areas of Wyoming, Idaho and
southern California.
   Heat-related deaths last week included eight in Missouri, and
one each in Georgia, Illinois and Indiana.
   In the Atlanta area, water officials said the drought provoked a
certain ingenuity among homeowners who are breaking the law by
using hidden sprinklers and inconspicuous hoses to water their
lawns illegally.
   ``People have got every kind of trick,'' said Terry Hicks,
deputy manager of the Clayton County Water Authority.
   A Henry County woman who hid her sprinkler behind a bush was
turned in by a neighbor. And many residents are using ``soaker
hoses'' _ flat garden hoses with small holes which can be laid
upside down to allow discreet, illegal watering.

   In nearly 5{ years as a top Navy official,
Melvyn R. Paisley gained a reputation both as a hard-nosed
administrator with little tolerance for functionaries and a bon
vivant who loved a good party.
   With his stylish young wife at his side, the 63-year-old Paisley
_ now a key figure in the Defense Department bribery case _ seemed
to make an impression on just about everyone with whom he worked or
socialized, according to former colleagues and acquaintances.
   ``He's an affable person, but he is tough as nails,'' said a
former Navy official who worked with Paisley, but did not want his
name used. ``Colorful is the way people describe Mel,'' another
official said.
   But Paisley had his detractors at the Navy, where he became
assistant secretary for research, engineering and systems in 1981
after a 28-year career with Boeing Co. in Seattle.
   With John F. Lehman Jr. as Navy secretary, Paisley joined a
small coterie of men who oversaw the massive buildup of the Navy to
600 ships. Paisley supervised procurement, specializing in
acquisition of aircraft and combat systems.
   ``There are lots of people in the Navy who don't like him, just
as they don't like Lehman,'' conceded Paisley's lawyer, E. Lawrence
Barcella. But he attributed those feelings to sour grapes over the
Lehman-Paisley effort to streamline costs and ``revitalize Navy
procurement.''
   But James Durst, a former Boeing executive, said Paisley had a
tarnished reputation before he joined the government.
   ``Usually every major company has one guy who does the dirty
business,'' Durst said. ``He was the guy.''
   Durst said he told the government in the early 1980s that
Paisley, while at Boeing, bragged of committing a felony
wiretapping operation and bribing people overseas for military
contracts.
   Barcella dismissed allegations made by Durst and Paisley's
ex-wife, Mildred McGetrick of Spokane, Wash. She told The Los
Angeles Times that she had informed the FBI in mid-1981 that
Paisley took gratuities and was ``dishonest with money.''
   ``Going to disgruntled ex-employees and ex-wives, that's more
than scraping the bottom of the barrel,'' Barcella said. ``That's
tilting it over and looking underneath.'''
   He noted that both the FBI and the Senate investigated Paisley
before his confirmation in November 1981.
   The FBI confirmed it conducted a routine background check on
Paisley and furnished it to the White House. Contents of the
investigation are confidential, FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer said.
   Barcella has answered calls on behalf of Paisley and his fourth
wife, Vicki, since the initial reports that FBI agents had searched
Paisley's office in their investigation into allegations that
defense contractors and consultants bribed Pentagon officials to
obtain classified material vital for winning multibillion-dollar
contracts. No one has been charged in the probe.
   The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that federal
investigators found ``stacks'' of classified federal documents that
Paisley had no security clearance to possess when they searched his
home and office. The Post cited informed officials for the
information.
   An engineer by training, Paisley listed himself in government
biography as a 1953 graduate of the American Institute of
Technology, and a 1954 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. MIT said Paisley attended one semester.
   Paisley and Lehman socialize together and live four houses apart
in an exclusive McLean, Va., neighborhood. The two men had formed a
friendship before President Reagan's election when Boeing hired
Lehman's military consulting firm, Abington Corp., for $350,000 a
year, according to a report published in The New York Times in 1983.
   Law enforcement officials have said Lehman, now a managing
director at Paine Webber Inc., is not a target of the
investigation, but investigators have evidence suggesting Lehman
may have tipped Paisley about the inquiry. Lehman has refused to be
interviewed.
   Paisley left government in March 1987 to form a defense
consulting business with an office in the Watergate complex, near
the office of his friend, William Galvin, another defense
consultant who is under investigation.
   Sources told The Los Angeles Times last week that, as a
consultant, Paisley and his wife copied secret documents, and
Paisley then allegedly passed the information to his major client,
McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Other sources said James Gaines, a deputy Navy secretary who
worked with Paisley at Boeing in the 1970s, is believed to be one
of the people who passed the information to Paisley. All of the
sources talked on condition their names not be used. Paisley's
other clients included BDM International Inc., a defense
contractor, and United Technologies Corp.
   Barcella said he would not comment on the allegations until he
has seen the evidence.
   This is not the first time Paisley has attracted the Justice
Department's interest. He was one of several former Boeing
officials sued for receiving improper severance payments. Paisley's
``golden handshake'' at Boeing, amounting to $183,000, is still
tied up in the courts.
   While Paisley managed the Navy's weapons-buying, his wife went
to work in 1983 for BDM, which hired Paisley as a consultant when
he resigned from the government.
   In 1986, Mrs. Paisley had several sources of income, according
to her husband's financial disclosure form. She received
unspecified amounts from BDM, Town and Country Real Estate, and
from VAMO Inc., a company in Vienna, Va. The Paisleys' friend,
William Galvin, was on VAMO's original board of directors, public
records show.
   The forms describe Mrs. Paisley as the sole owner of VAMO, with
the ownership worth between $15,000 and $50,000.
   VAMO is a ``computer-type'' business that helps companies solve
management problems, according to Robert Plotkin, another attorney
for Mrs. Paisley. Galvin's lawyer, William Nussbaum, refused to
comment on matters pertaining to his client.

   Jack Montgomery has a bunch of hard workers on
his northwest Georgia farm, but they haven't done much lately
except stay home and fan themselves.
   ``It's the danged drought,'' the 68-year-old beekeeper said.
``All the flowers have died. North Georgia's honey production
should be at its peak right now but it's already stopped for the
year.''
   So, instead of spending these summer days collecting nectar and
making honey, Montgomery's bees are trying to beat the heat, which
was expected to reach only the upper 80s today after hovering near
100 degrees for the past week or so.
   ``The bees actually air condition their hives when it gets this
hot,'' he said last week. ``They deposit little droplets of water
along the top of the honey frames and then fan their wings, causing
it to evaporate and cool the hive.
   ``Then, they move the cool air throughout the hive, and take it
out the door when it starts to heat up. They keep repeating the
process all day long.''

   To an uncertain and divided electorate,
Michael Dukakis is ``a blank page'' whose lead over George Bush is
grounded in negative feelings about the Republican vice president,
rather than positive attitudes toward the Democratic nominee-to-be,
according to a survey released today.
   The national poll did find Democrats remarkably united behind
Dukakis at this point, although there are weaknesses in the

   Much of Dukakis' strength comes from voters worried about the
course of the nation.
   ``Democrats are seen as the party of change. Bush is not,'' said
Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization, which conducted
the poll for the Times-Mirror Corp.
   The survey, the latest in a series for the media company, is

   It's 112 degrees in the shade in
parts of the Mojave Desert these days. But the political heat is
rising as folks from here to Washington fight over a plan to set
aside 7.5 million acres as wilderness.
   The battleground is a starkly beautiful land of brushy desert
and craggy mountains, stretching from Death Valley to the Mexican
border, from the snow-capped Sierra Nevada and coast ranges to the
sandy borders of Nevada and Arizona.
   The rugged 35,000-square-mile sweep is home to shy bighorn
sheep, the threatened desert tortoise and a few hard-working cattle
ranchers. It has two existing national parks, rich lodes of gold
and minerals and a sprinkling of fiercely independent communities.

   Paying the world's highest prices for fertilizer
and feed and confined to tiny plots of land, Japanese farmers are
in the best of times squeezed to make a profit.
   But a new U.S.-Japan pact to open up the nation's markets to
cheaper American beef and oranges has sown considerable anxiety
among farmers.
   Ikko Abe, a 57-year-old cattle farmer in Japan's northeastern
Iwate Prefecture, decided he could no longer cope. He hanged
himself on June 18, just two days before U.S. and Japanese
officials finished the beef and orange agreement.
   ``I oppose the liberalization of beef imports. I will protest
with my death,'' Abe wrote in a suicide note.
   The Japanese government acceded to U.S. demands to gradually
phase out quotas blocking imports over a three-year period
beginning 1991.
   Farm Minister Takashi Sato signed a similar agreement with
Australian officials in Canberra on June 24.

   For a few days that tried her
soul, Kate Uhlir left her suburban Cleveland routine to witness
life in a Georgia prison and to share what was supposed to be a
death-row inmate's final hours.
   On June 16, Freddie Davis, Ms. Uhlir's longtime pen pal, was
spared from the electric chair, at least for 90 days. The Georgia
Board of Pardons and Paroles suspended his execution six hours
before it was to be carried out.
   ``I sort of felt like a soldier on an island with a bow and
arrow to defend the island and there were tanks coming at me,'' Ms.
Uhlir recalled.
   The 49-year-old office manager and mother of six first wrote
Davis in 1980 after a friend involved in a Cincinnati-based program
called Prison Pen Pals gave her his name and address. She said she
knew nothing about him or his crime.

   The light green leaves of some trees in
the middle of the dark green forest of Michigan's Lower Peninsula
have the fragile look of spring's new growth, and some scattered
trees show exposed, brown branches.
   The thinner growth is evidence of a ravenous little caterpillar
_ the juvenile stage of the gypsy moth _ that is making life
miserable for uncounted people across the United States.
   And the drought is increasing the damage, as trees already
weakened by lack of water try to fight off the effects of repeated

   Rainshowers over northern India in the
past week have raised hopes of a good harvest after three years of
devastating drought.
   Farmers have dispatched tractors and bullock teams to plow their
dusty brown fields so they can begin sowing the summer crop.
   ``If it keeps raining, it will be fantastic,'' said Ram Phal, a
farmer in Narsinghpur, 25 miles southwest of New Delhi. ``I can
hear frogs croaking at night and that means a good monsoon.''
   While farmers in America's heartland hope for rain to save their
crops, weathermen in India predict this year's monsoon will be
normal this year for the first time since 1984. The last three
summers brought increasing hardship and sometimes hunger to the 534
million Indians _ two-thirds of the total 800 million population _
who depend on agriculture for their livelihood.

long-buried court testimony.
   A massive criminal investigation of Pentagon contracting
practices is centered on the passing of secret information to
private consultants, who in turn sold it to contractors.
   The system wasn't widely talked about between the Defense
Department and contractors and so ``my mouth fell open'' when a

   A new Airbus 320 that crashed at an air show was
flying too low for the load it carried and the pilot did not have
time to maneuver it out of danger, officials said Monday following
a preliminary investigation.
   Three passengers were killed and 50 injured as the jetlinger
crashed into the woods Sunday during a demonstration flight near
Mulhouse in eastern France.
   Daniel Tennenbaum, chief of the Civil Aviation Authority, said
the Air France jet was flying at 30 feet.
   In Mulhouse, prosecutor Jean Volff said: ``The A320 passed at 30
feet altitude, which is completely outside the technical norms when
it is carrying passengers.''
   He said the normal minimum altitude for such conditions was 100
feet and added, without giving details, that the pilot had
``disconnected the automatic controls at the moment of the accident
and was in manual control.''
   Tennenbaum told a news conference in Paris the fully
computerized aircraft needed eight seconds to respond to the
command of pilot Michel Hasseline and only five seconds were
available because of the low altitude.

   Communities may ban picketing aimed
specifically at someone's home, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3
vote Monday.
   The court, saying ``there simply is no right to force speech
into the home of an unwilling listener,'' ruled that such bans do
not necessarily violate free-speech rights.
   But the justices unanimously rejected arguments that public
streets in residential neighborhoods are not the type of
traditional public forum where freedom of expression is protected.
   The court therefore said communities may not ban pickets from
marching through a residential neighborhood, or even walking back
and forth along a block on which the home they want to target is
located.
   The decision is a defeat for anti-abortion activists who were
barred from picketing a doctor's home in the Milwaukee suburb of
Brookfield, Wis.

   The vice president trails Democrat Michael Dukakis in the survey

Bush an opening to tighten the race in the fall, said analyst
Norman Ornstein.

   The Federal Reserve, which already has imposed

   These economists said the credit tightening would most likely
include an increase in the discount rate _ the rate charged for
loans to member banks _ by the end of July. A boost in the discount
rate, which currently stands at 6 percent, is the most dramatic
signal the Fed can send of its intent to push interest rates higher.

Market Committee, meets Wednesday and Thursday behind closed doors

   The more time that children _ especially boys

complete, university researchers say.
   And time spent with a single parent during the formative,
pre-school years seems to have a particularly negative impact on a
boy's future education, according to Sheila Fitzgerald Krein and
Andrea H. Beller of the School of Human Resources and Family
Studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana.
   Single, working mothers appear to provide greater incentive, as
a role model, for their daughters than their sons, Beller said in a
telephone interview Monday. She said that while the role-model
influence, in the case of girls, appears to compensate for the
mother's loss of time at home, ``the boy doesn't have this model,
he just has the loss of a parent.''

<HEAD>With Baltic Ice Melted, `Submarine Season' Begins for Swedes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the Baltic Ice has melted,
it's ``submarine season'' once again for Sweden _ the time of year
when unidentified underwater objects make pests of themselves.
   The season has been rolling around in Swedish territorial waters
every year since 1981 when a Soviet submarine, allegedly snooping,
ran aground outside the Karlskrona naval base.
   Experts who investigated another engagement in 1982 determined
the intruder also was a Soviet sub, and Sweden lodged a diplomatic
protest with Moscow.
   But no snooping sub has ever been captured or, so far as anyone
knows, laid to rest on the bottom.
   The government is strengthening its anti-submarine forces,
nevertheless. Four new corvettes and a mine detector are being
added to the current fleet of two corvettes, 16 older patrol boats,
12 submarines, one reconnaissance plane, 12 helicopters and six
mine detectors.
   In addition, $339 million have been allocated to anti-submarine
warfare above the regular defense budget set through 1992.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, a stalwart of Sweden's
traditional peace and neutrality policy, told reporters last year
that ``blood will flow'' if the navy gets its sights on a foreign
intruder.
   Nowadays, Swedish ships and aircraft bombard suspected intruders
with depth charges, mines and other weapons.
   A pamphlet published by the national defense staff, titled ``Our
Uninvited Visitors,'' tells fishermen and other coastal dwellers
what to do if they sight periscopes. Hundreds of people report
``sightings'' each year.
   Since 1982, however, no snooping submarine has been identified
by nationality.
   So far this year, Swedish ships and helicopters have used live
ammunition in nine separate chases of ``submarines'' along the
country's 4,750-mile coastline.
   This was the first year since 1984 that the navy exploded any of
the 660- to 1,980-pound, remote-controlled mines scattered around
its bases and harbors, according to the armed forces spokesman,
H.G. Wessberg.
   The results so far? Two confirmed hits of sub-shaped undersea
rocks and one possible hit of a submarine, which supposedly escaped
in the roiling waters after the attack.
   ``That submarine was exactly where we thought it was, and the
weapons were very close,'' Wessberg said in an interview. ``We
think we might have scored some minor damage.
   ``The risk for the intruders is rising gradually. Not much, but
it's rising.''
   Since Sweden's coastline equals about half the distance of the
front between the West's NATO military alliance and the East bloc's
Warsaw Pact, hostilities in these waters are of interest to both of
those military sides.
   Swedish officials are careful, however, not to single out either
side for the intrusions, in keeping with the country's neutrality.
But most Swedes seem to believe the Soviets are the main culprits.
   In any case, Sweden doesn't care who is snooping or why, said
Wessberg. What matters is that ``somebody is there who shouldn't be
there.''
   The main problem, he said, is that Sweden's geography makes it
one of the most difficult places in the world to hunt submarines.
   The coastline is dotted with thousands of rocks and islands subs
can hide behind. Rivers running into the shallow Baltic make layers
of difference in its salt content and temperature, foiling sonar
and other detection gear.
   The sea bottom is also littered with metallic junk and natural
chunks of iron ore that offer undersea camouflage. It is estimated
that at least one in every 10 Swedes owns a boat, so civilian water
traffic is heavy and often noisy.
   The navy loosened its rules of engagement this year, giving
commanders greater leeway to fire without warning.
   ``We would rather shoot the rock too much than miss a submarine,
as long as there is no danger to civilian traffic,'' said Thomas
Gur, another defense spokesman.
   ``Stress has to be made that we are shooting to kill. Or at
least liquidate the boat.''

   A 1,500-mile defensive wall has
brought stalemate to the 12-year-old Polisario guerrilla war to
wrest control of the Western Sahara from Morocco.
   The guerrillas say they hold out little hope for an outright
military victory.
   They now talk of compromise in their campaign for an independent
nation in the former Spanish colony in northwest Africa.
Nevertheless, refugees remain keyed up for war in teeming Polisario
camps near the Algerian border where military training begins in
primary school and their slogan, ``The Entire Nation or
Martyrdom,'' is everywhere.
   They have been fighting for independence since 1976 when Spain
relinquished what then was the Spanish Sahara to joint Moroccan and
Mauritanian control.
   Mauritania withdrew from the conflict in 1979 but Morocco
maintained the fight to hold its sovereignty over the territory,
which is about the size of Colorado and is rich in phosphates and
possibly potash and iron ore.
   Morocco began building its defensive wall of rock and sand in
1980. Now completed, it is studded with concrete bunkers and
U.S.-made sensors to detect infiltrators.
   Almost all of Morocco's 100,000-man army is deployed along the
wall, and guerrilla attacks behind it have virtually stopped.
   Talking to visiting Western reporters in their camp at Akuadim,
the guerrillas acknowledged that their ``liberation struggle'' has
degenerated into a series of brief hit-and-run assaults on Moroccan
defenses.
   Bachir Sayed, a member of Polisario's seven-member Executive
Committee, told the visitors: ``We don't want to defeat Morocco. We
want to create a different situation ... that will bring
(Morocco's) King Hassan II to the bargaining table.''
   The guerrillas suffered a serious blow in May when Algeria,
which has supported the Polisario Front, restored the diplomatic
relations it broke with Morocco over the issue.
   Algerian officials now are hinting that Polisario might accept
some kind of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, but the
guerrillas have not acknowledged this is their intent.
   Their main sanctuary now is in the stark, hilly desert around
the oasis of Tindouf inside Algeria.
   The last Algerian checkpoint is three miles outside Tindouf.
After that are camps for more than 100,000 refugees, followed along
the road by miles of sand and shrub. The comes the ``battle zone''
that stretches across Algeria's border into a no man's land leading
to the Moroccan wall.
   Polisario has built hospitals and military schools in the zone,
but the guerrillas say they intend to abandon the area whenever
they ``return'' to the Moroccan-held phosphate mines and fishing
ports on the Atlantic coast.
   When Spanish colonial rule ended, the territory's population
comprised 80,000 tribal nomads roaming the desert with camels and
goats.
   Polisario claims to have 16,000 heavily armed guerrillas
operating in the desert. Moroccan officers estimate guerrilla
strength at fewer than 4,000.
   Abba Deddi, a 23-year-old Polisario guerrilla said he could not
imagine being anything in life but a soldier.
   ``I want to remain a soldier even after the liberation, to fight
against any new colonialist attempts,'' he said.
   Out in the battle zone, a five-hour drive from Tindouf across a
featureless desert, a group of uniformed guerrillas played cards on
a blanket, surrounded by empty artillery shells scattered on the
sand. They were desert men, ranging from 18-year-old recruits to
veterans of the Spanish Foreign Legion.
   Artillery fire thudded in the distance as the Moroccans
responded to an attack on the wall by another Polisario unit.
   The firing stopped abruptly.
   ``That's all,'' said Omar Mohammed, the unit commander. ``We
give them 10 minutes every two or three hours. It keeps them on
their toes.''
   Mohammed said his forces frequently cross the Moroccan wall
after disabling its radar system. The Moroccans claim not a single
attack has even reached the wall's outer defenses since last summer.
   ``We have the advantage of knowing the desert and of speed,''
Mohammed said. ``We dismantle the mines, cut the barbed wire, cross
in, capture weapons, take prisoners and retreat.''
   Omar Khatry, director of a Polisario military training school,
said the wall ``built up Moroccan confidence and stopped our
attacks somewhat.'' He claimed, however, that new tactics enabled
the guerrillas to ``develop a full war of attrition'' but didn't
elaborate.
   In an effort to assure an ever-increasing Saharan population,
Polisario war widows are required to remarry after a four-month
waiting period.
   ``I have to continue having children,'' said one recent bride,
Ghaluha el-Salma, whose husband died in the Polisario ranks and
left her with a daughter.

forced by state laws to admit women as full members with the same
status as men.
   In 1985, CBS Inc. announced it would buy back 21 percent of its
stock for nearly $1 billion to thwart a takeover bid by Ted Turner.
   In 1986, President Reagan presided over a gala, patriotic
ceremony in New York Harbor for the relighting of the renovated
Statue of Liberty.
   Ten years ago: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Federal
Communications Commission was within its authority to reprimand a
New York radio station for broadcasting a George Carlin comedy
routine titled ``Filthy Words.''
   Five years ago: Tennis star John McEnroe regained the men's
singles title at Wimbledon, defeating unseeded Chris Lewis of New
Zealand in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. (One day earlier, Martina
Navratilova had captured the women's title with a 6-0, 6-3 victory
over Andrea Jaeger.)
   One year ago: Two men became the first hot-air balloon travelers
to cross the Atlantic. British millionaire Richard Branson and
Swedish-born Per Lindstrand, the balloon's designer, were forced to
jump into the sea as their craft went down off the coast of
Scotland.
   Today's birthdays: Movie director Ken Russell is 61. Jazz
musician Pete Fountain is 58. Playwright Tom Stoppard is 51.
Actress Betty Buckley is 41. Former Haitian President Jean-Claude
Duvalier is 37. Singer Laura Branigan is 31.

   Today is Monday, July 4, the 186th day of 1988. There are 180
days left in the year. This is Independence Day.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the
Declaration of Independence.
   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident,'' said the document,
``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
   On this date:
   In 1802, the U.S. Military Academy officially opened at West
Point, N.Y.
   In 1826, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the second and third
presidents of the United States, both died, 50 years to the day
after the Declaration of Independence was adopted.
   In 1831, the fifth U.S. president, James Monroe, died in New
York City.
   In 1862, English clergyman Charles L. Dodgson (alias ``Lewis
Carroll'') began inventing the story of Alice in Wonderland for his
friend Alice Pleasance Liddell during a boating trip.

and even commendable in a foreigner is blameworthy in a cousin.'' _
Sir John Buchan, Scottish author and Canadian government official

   Never underestimate the power of the pen,
particularly when it's in the hand of an irate television viewer
whose favorite show has just been canceled.
   At least 2,800 people have written to NBC to express their
disappointment with the cancellation of ``A Year in the Life.''
Television critics have similar letters. The Associated Press
received about 50 urging the return of the show next fall.
   ``I know that 4,000 people have written me about `A Year in the
Life,''' said Dorothy Swanson of Fairfax, Va., director of Viewers
for Quality Television. VQT is the nation's leading organizer of
mail campaigns and in the past has saved such shows as CBS'
``Cagney & Lacey'' and ``Designing Women.''
   ``I'm getting an average of 200 letters a day. I think if 4,000
people care enough to write to me, they will also write to NBC.
This mail exceeds what I received in the `Designing Women' campaign
and is approaching `Our World' (an ABC news show). Viewers are very
upset. People are passionate about this show. People are tired of
losing quality shows.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, said his
network had never reversed a cancellation because of viewer mail.
``But that doesn't mean we don't look at the mail,'' he said. ``Our
decisions regarding shows are not set in stone. It's just that
we've never reversed ourselves yet.''
   Tartikoff said the most mail NBC had ever received was after it
dropped ``Little House on the Prairie'' after 10 years. He did not
recall the number of letters.
   Other canceled show, such as NBC's ``Days and Nights of Molly
Dodd'' and ``Aaron's Way'' and ABC's ``The Slap Maxwell Story'' are
also drawing mail, but not in large amounts.
   The networks do respond to viewer mail. ``Designing Women'' was
getting good ratings on Monday nights, then in December 1986, CBS
moved it to Thursday against NBC's ``Night Court.'' In two weeks it
dropped from 20th in the ratings to 63rd. CBS pulled the show off
the air.
   Swanson's VQT members wrote 50,000 letters to CBS and the show
went back on the air and became a hit again.
   ``We certainly do look at all viewer mail,'' said David
Poltrack, vice president for marketing at CBS. ``While volume is
important, we differentiate significantly between mail that is
coming in an unorganized way, from a large number of viewers, from
that mail which is part of an organized campaign. If we get a lot
of letters that are the same, we are somewhat skeptical of the
depth of the feeling.
   ``When we feel we have a significant amount of viewer mail on a
subject we try to confirm what they are trying to tell us through
scientific research. At the end of the season we got a lot of mail
about `Wiseguy.' This is a program whose future was in doubt. We
noted that we were getting a strong support. We didn't take that
alone as an indication of the show's potential. We also interviewed
a random sample of people and discussed with them their views
toward `Wiseguy.' We learned it had a very loyal audience.''
   In January 1984 ``Cagney & Lacey'' rose from the ashes to become
a hit and pick up numerous Emmy awards. The previous season CBS had
canceled the show, but in the reruns ``Cagney & Lacey'' suddenly
became a winner and led CBS to three straight victories in the
Nielsen ratings.
   CBS changed its mind because of the ratings turnaround, because
the press lobbied for its return and because the public flooded the
network with mail asking for its return.
   It was the first time a network had put a canceled show back on
the air because of viewer reaction since ABC brought back ``The Law
and Mr. Jones'' in 1962. That reprieve lasted only six months.
   Viewers had less success with ``Our World,'' which ABC dropped a
year ago. Despite an enormous mail campaign, ABC declined to bring
the show back and host Linda Ellerbee left the network. She is now
trying to reprise the show on public television.
   ``Last year ABC lost a large number of demographically valued
viewers who had watched `Our World.' These people have gone back to
watching PBS and cable,'' said Swanson.
   ``I think NBC had a valuable demographic audience with `A Year
in the Life.' Are they willing to throw these people away?
Tartikoff said canceling `A Year in the Life' was the single most
difficult decision he had to make. If he feels that way, then
bringing it back should be easy.''

<TEXT>
   International celebrities, including
music star Paul Simon, have joined in a campaign to save the
world's largest example of Portuguese colonial architecture in
downtown Salvador, one of the Western Hemisphere's oldest cities.
   The 91-acre district is now a slum.
   It is called Pelourinho, the Portuguese word for ``pillory,''
stemming from Salvador's former slave trade.
   Pelourinho's largely abandoned facades line the narrow streets
of the city that also was Brazil's first capital and sometimes is
known to outsiders as Bahia, the name of the coastal city's state.
   In addition to Paul Simon, other international celebrities
involved in the campaign include the Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias
nd Akio Morito, president of the Sony Corp.
   Of the district's 978 buildings, some dating as far back as the
1500s, 300 are close to collapse, 48 are in ruins, and about 10
slide down hillsides every year in seasonal rainstorms, according
to Maria del Carmen, coordinator of the save-Pelourinho campaign.
   Pelourinho's spacious mansions housed the elite when Salvador
was, until 1763, the capital of Portugal's vast South American
Colony. Today it is a Skid Row, home to prostitutes, drug dealers
and muggers.
   ``Pelourinho must be the world's largest Baroque slum,'' said
the Bahia state secretary for culture, Gilberto Gil, who also is a
popular singer and composer. ``There are people in this city who
haven't dared venture into Pelourinho for the past 20 years.''
   But for the first time authorities, encouraged by private
business, have launched a massive campaign to clean up the winding
streets and half-collapsed mansions, which in 1987 were designated
by UNESCO as part of mankind's ``cultural heritage.'' The buildings
are protected from demolition by a local decree.
   ``If we don't do something now, the whole beautiful area will be
completely irrecoverable in 10 years,'' said Ms. del Carmen, an
engineer.
   But conversely, it was after the UNESCO designation that the
colonial buildings, arcades, courtyards and cobblestone streets
began fell into greater disarray.
   ``Landlords refused to invest in their properties, which were
inhabited by tenants who could pay almost no rent,'' Gil said.
``And they weren't allowed to tear down their buildings. So the
strategy was to let the buildings literally fall down _ with
tenants inside them.''
   So far, the so-called Historical Park of Pelourinho, operating
with 150 functionaries borrowed from various municipal government
offices, has raised the equivalent of about $7 million in
government grants and loans, Ms. del Carmen said. But organizers
hope a media campaign that began in February directed at foreign
and domestic business communities will bring in much more.
   Morita, Simon and Iglesias are featured in 60-second public
service announcements asking for donations and encouraging
businesses to invest in the area.
   ``We need Brazilians and others to feel responsible for the
area, to understand that Brazil was born here and want to leave
this for their children,'' Ms. del Carmen said. ``Most of the
people who actually live here exist in subhuman conditions and
could care less about Pelourinho.''
   Black groups have been some of the most active in rallying to
save the decaying center, as part of a slow but growing
black-consciousness movement in mixed-race Brazil.
   Pelourinho was a major port of entry for slaves from Africa from
the 1500s through 1888, when slavery was abolished in Brazil. One
of the area's most beautiful buildings, the Rosary of the Blacks
Church, was built over a period of 150 years by and for slaves.
   ``Every stone here was laid with the sweat of blacks,'' said an
area resident known only as ``Zoinho.'' ``We have to save this
area. It's a monument to our suffering.''
   Paulo de Jesus, 18, lives with his father and four brothers and
sisters in two rooms of a massively subdivided old home. He was
born in Pelourinho.
   ``I wouldn't leave this place,'' he said. ``This is my home. But
if you knocked down our old home and built an apartment building in
it's place, we'd be much happier.''
   Some residents are worried that increased property values will
drive out long-time inhabitants.
   ``We have to make sure we don't turn Pelourinho into a picture
postcard,'' Ms. del Carmen said. ``The sense of community here is
rich and very strong. We need to bring in jobs, schools, health
facilities and give people the chance to appreciate the fabulous
historicl setting.''

   In the final days of a presidential race
they're expected to lose, Mexico's opposition parties are stepping
up their claims that the government and ruling party will steal
victory from them.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the man virtually guaranteed victory
as candidate of the government's Institutional Revolutionary Party,
is hammering just as hard at his claim that he will win Wednesday
in a clean election.
   Opposition parties long have accused the dominant PRI, as it is
commonly called, of stuffing or stealing ballot boxes and other
forms of vote fraud.
   But the charges are being hurled with more force and frequency
than in past campaigns for the nation's top office. This year's
opposition is presenting the PRI with its biggest presidential
challenge since the 1950s at a time when its candidate is seen as
weakened by Mexico's economic crisis and general discontent.
   In a change from the past, Salinas de Gortari has acknowledged
that a fraud problem exists. Juan Enriquez, his spokesman, says the
need for a clean election is one of the top issues in his campaign.
   ``It is not only the PRI presidential candidate who rejects
obsolete practices and electoral trickery, it is the majority of
Mexicans,'' Salinas de Gortari said in a speech April 22.
   ``Let us hold clean, clear elections. ... You can be sure that
we will defend our victories, but we will equally accept our
defeats,'' he said.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former state governor who led a dissident
movement in the PRI and broke away to become candidate of nearly
all the leftist parties, said recently he saw much evidence of
preparation of ``a fraud of enormous dimensions.''
   Manuel J. Clouthier, candidate of the conservative National
Action Party, has charged that ``electoral fraud has been prepared
throughout the country.''
   ``The problem is that the tendency of fraud and the real
interests that would be affected by a clean election could be more
powerful than a mere desire for honesty by Salinas de Gortari,''
Jorge G. Castaneda, a well-known author and political scientist,
wrote in the current issue of the magazine Nexos.
   Opposition leaders say the PRI's repertoire of means of fraud is
vast, ranging from inflating the voter registration lists to giving
workers ballots already marked for the PRI.
   ``All the cemeteries in Mexico City are on the registration
lists,'' charged Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a former head of the PRI and
ambassador to the United Nations who with Cardenas organized the
dissident movement known as the Democratic Current.
   In rural areas where opposition representatives usually are not
present at the polls, ``they fill the boxes as they want,'' he
added.
   Said Raul Trejo, of the National University's Institute for
Social Research: ``There are municipalities in the country where
the PRI has gotten 100 percent of the votes or more, ... where the
vote was greater than the registration list.''
   Opposition leaders contend that manipulation of the process is
not limited to election day and they have complained loudly that
voter registration was closed as long before the election as Dec.
31.
   Enriquez, the PRI candidate's spokesman, said the reason was to
give parties six months to check their copies of the electoral
rolls.
   While by law all parties are allotted radio and television time,
National Action, particularly, has complained that some stations
wouldn't sell it time or cancelled interviews.
   Virtually all television stations in Mexico are either
government-owned or closely aligned with the government, including
the major Televisa private network.
   The other two candidates, Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the
Trotskyite Revolutionary Workers Party, and Gumersindo Magana of
the conservative Mexican Democratic Party, have complained of
similar problems.
   Enriquez says the opposition parties raise accusations of fraud
to excuse their losses.
   ``It is very difficult, in fact impossible, I think, to show
that there's a massive, systematic change of the voting patterns of
the population,'' he said.
   Opposition parties say their main defense will be to try to have
representatives at all the polling places this time, although it
can be difficult in the remote mountain regions of the country.
   Clouthier has urged the Mexican army to prevent fraud and called
repeatedly for civil disobedience if irregularities show up.
Cardenas says his parties will use ``popular mobilization,''
essentially the same thing.
   With its extensive grassroots system of organization among rural
people, labor and other sectors, and government benefits such as
housing and health care, the PRI in most cases can win without
resorting to what is popularly known here as ``alchemy.''
   ``It would be naive to say that there are not electoral frauds
in Mexico,'' Francisco Baez Rodriguez, an economics professor at
the National University, said in an article in Nexos.
   ``But it is equally naive to pretend that the dominance of the
PRI finds its main sustenance in fraud, at least in federal
elections.''

<HEAD>Niger Tries Family Planning to Ease Strains on Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NIAMEY, Niger (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unable to turn back the advancing Sahara
Desert or stop periodic droughts, Niger has turned to family
planning to control population growth and reduce pressure on its
fragile resources.
   The north-central African nation has only 6.8 million people in
an area twice the size of France, but it can't feed itself and at
its current growth rate the population will double in 23 years.
   Three and a half years ago the government strongly endorsed
family planning, an unprecedented move in this largely Moslem area
of Africa just below the Sahara, and in April it legalized
contraception.
   ``The legalization of contraception is concrete proof of the
government's support for family planning,'' said Dr. Halima
Maidouka Diallo, director of family planning in the Ministry of
Health.
   To counter African traditions in favor of large families and
avoid potential clashes with some interpretations of the Koran, the
Moslems' holy book, the government presented family planning as a
necessary move to reduce infant and maternal mortality.
   Niger's infant mortality rate of 135 deaths per 1,000 births and
maternal mortality rate of 7 deaths per 1,000 births are among the
highest in the world.
   ``For a woman to be valued here, she must have many children as
soon as possible. Children help with work and are considered life
insurance,'' Maidouka said.
   ``Women are considered wicked if they do not produce children,''
she added.
   Customarily, if a woman doesn't bear children, a husband will
look for another wife.
   Because many infants die, mothers bear many children. It is not
unusual for a mother to have 15 children with only five surviving.
   The frequent births become both a cause and effect. Women become
pregnant again as soon as possible after delivery, without time to
fully recover, and often give birth prematurely to infants who have
little chance of surviving.
   It also creates problems in schools, where many young girls
become pregnant. The average age for marriage for women is about
15{.
   Some women seek abortions clandestinely, as they are not legal
here, or go to neighboring countries.
   ``At least once a month there is a case of a baby being
strangled and tossed in a trash can,'' Maidouka said.
   She added that suicides are also a problem among women with
unwanted pregnancies.
   The family planning program seeks to offer women an alternative.
   ``A child if I want, when I want,'' says a poster displayed
throughout the country's main family planning center.
   The center, built with funding from the United Nations, has a
large poster explaining various contraception methods. The
explanations are accompanied by explicit diagrams showing, among
other things, how to use a condom.
   The diagrams are necessary in a nation where only 4.4 percent of
the women are literate and only 20 percent of children go to
primary schools.
   Dr. Voahangi Ravao of Malagasy, a staff associate of the
Columbia University Center for Population and Family Health, says
the most common reason given in a Niamey survey of women who did
not use family planning was ``nobody told me.''
   Opposition by husbands was cited by only 5 percent, she said.
   She added that she has seen women who've walked 10 miles to pick
up birth control pills.
   She said a survey taken a year ago showed 6 to 10 percent of the
women were using some form of modern contraception, which is a very
high rate for the Sahel, the region just below the Sahara.
   In the West African nation of Burkina Faso, for example, a
similar survey found 4 to 6 percent of women using modern birth
control methods.
   Maidouka said radio and television broadcasts, in the main
national languages, will be used to reach as many people as
possible.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development has approved an
$11-million, five-year grant, to support the project.
   In a report, the agency said Niger's ``rapid population growth
has accentuated the processes of deforestation and
desertification.''
   It added, ``Wood harvesting, which provides 80 percent of the
nation's energy, far exceeds the sustainable capacity of the
forests. The forested area has decreased by 30 percent over the
last 20 years due to pressure from farmers, herders, firewood
cutters and drought.''
   Only 12 percent of the country is arable, and only 3 percent can
be used for growing crops. The annual per capita income is $240.
   The U.S. agency's report concedes that even if couples were
limited immediately to two children per family the population would
continue to grow for 40 years because almost half the current
population are teen-agers. And the agency says it is likely to take
30 years to reach the goal of only two children per family.
   The family-planning project, however, doesn't even talk of
limiting families to two children.
   It focuses on how planning and spacing of pregnancies will mean
better health for mother and child.
   ``There is much to do,'' Maidouka said. ``Tradition is a
problem. Perhaps our children will have full rights. Now the man is
the boss.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When the Democrats gather in Atlanta in mid-July
to anoint Michael Dukakis, there'll be time for remembrance of
political battles past. Not many will look back in fondness,
however, to that other convention two decades ago when the party
tore itself apart in Chicago and demonstrators' heads were split in
the city's streets, all under the eyes of national television.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the last week of August 1968. It was the
Democratic National Convention. It was a mismatch of epic
proportions, and it was being televised live.
   Some five months earlier, Lyndon Baines Johnson had announced he
would not seek nor accept his party's nomination _ the president's
plummeting popularity another casualty of the Vietnam war.
   Four days later, on April 4, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot to
death in Memphis, igniting big city ghettos across America.
   A month after that, Bobby Kennedy was shot in the head while
walking through a California hotel hours after winning that state's
primary. He died the next day.
   And in the heat of late summer, pacifists, anarchists and
hedonists, hippies, Yippies, poets and mystics, delegates,
Dixiecrats and bureaucrats swelled the streets of Chicago each day
_ each with designs on the convention and all certain they could
cure what ailed America.
   Each night, those who had learned to live with the war bunkered
in the luxurious hotels along Michigan Avenue, where they might
hear Dixiecrat Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia espouse the dangers of
letting misinformed socialists and power-mad politicians take over
the party.
   Those who opposed the war bivouacked in the city's lakefront
parks, where they could listen to Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman
promote the politics of confrontation, beat generation poet Allen
Ginsberg chant Hindu hymns, or folk singer Phil Ochs remind them,
``It's always the old who lead us to war; it's always the young who
fall.''
   And before the week was out, each camp would command center
stage in the drama that reached into living rooms across the nation.
   Twenty years later, there are still reminders of the Democratic
Party's brief flirtation with anarchy. The New York Times commented
in mid-June: ``This is a party that ... has been quite willing to
destroy itself to thrash out the most divisive issues that the
country faced, among them civil rights and the war in Vietnam.''
   And among consequences of '68 were far-reaching reforms that in
effect broke the power of old-line party bosses, devised new ways
in its nominating procedures and kept the White House in Republican
hands in three of four elections.
   ``It was a tragic year for the Democratic Party and for
responsible politics in a way,'' recalls former Minnesota Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, a presidential aspirant and principal in the
events of 1968.
   ``There were already forces at work that might have torn the
party apart anyway _ the growing women's movement, the growing
demands for greater racial equality, an inability to incorporate
all the demands of a new generation.
   ``But in 1968, the party became a kind of unrelated bloc of
factions ... each refusing accommodation with another, each wanting
control at the expense of all the others,'' says McCarthy, who now
lives in Virginia and is putting the finishing touches on his 12th
book of essays, ``Required Reading.''

   ``Nobody,'' growled Richard J. Daley, Chicago's bull-tempered
mayor, ``is going to take over this city.''
   But as darkness fell Wednesday, Aug. 28, with three days of
skirmishing already behind them, thousands of would-be
revolutionaries tried to take the streets in front of the Conrad
Hilton Hotel from who-knows-how-many cops wielding 75-cent night
sticks.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: 75-cent night sticks.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The hotel's aging facade reflected the eerie glow of television
lights as line after line of helmeted police officers followed
tear-gas canisters into the crowd, a sky-blue scythe cutting a
blood-red swath.
   ``I remember finding a room high up in the hotel so I could
watch. Thinking back,'' recalled Mike Royko, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist of the Chicago Tribune, ``it's hard to
believe that spasm of, well, silliness, turned out to be a pivotal
point in American history.
   ``That's not to minimize the goals of some of the people in the
anti-war movement. There were people in there with genuine social
consciences, and many were active in the civil rights movement.
   ``But because people saw this on TV, the fight for the
Democratic Party came down to a confrontation between bullheaded
cops and a bunch of nervous, tired kids following leaders who
talked about revolutionary theory and suddenly had everybody paying
attention.
   ``I remember the chant, `The whole world is watching.' Well,
most of America was anyway, and except for Jimmy Carter squeaking
through, they have put Republicans in the White House ever since.''
   From a five-room suite on the Hilton's 25th floor, then Vice
President Hubert Humphrey watched the scene below, his fate already
in the hands of men whose job was to keep the chaos in the streets
from reaching the convention site four miles to the south.
   Humphrey had not won a single one of the 15 party primaries, had
not even entered the campaign until two days after LBJ said he was
getting out.
   Yet everyone who came to Chicago that week _ the supporters of
the dovish McCarthy, the backers of earnest South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern, the idealists who hadn't recovered from Robert
Kennedy's assassination _ knew Humphrey likely would emerge the
candidate.
   In 1968, delegates ran on primary ballots without a stated
preference, and the political professionals _ the governor, the
mayor, the state party chairman _ exercised an inordinate amount of
influence on how the entire delegation voted.
   That enabled Humphrey to court the local heavyweights and come
away with all the delegates in states such as Pennsylvania, which
had given 90 percent of its vote to McCarthy in the ``beauty
contest.''
   It was as crude a display of power as had been seen in many
years, punctuated by the televised sequence of Daley drawing a
finger across his broad neck in a signal to the podium to cut the
microphones as Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff gave his
nominating speech for McGovern and spoke of ``Gestapo tactics in
the streets of Chicago.''
   Soon afterward, those same party professionals delivered
Humphrey's first-ballot nomination with the same sanguine
efficiency police displayed in their 20-minute downtown sweep of
protesters.
   ``I recall seeing (anti-war protest leader David) Dellinger
standing along the curb right in front of the Blackstone Hotel,''
said Deputy Chief of Patrol Carl Dobrich, who served in the Chicago
police task force that night.
   ``He was standing there like a whipped puppy. He was in this
incredibly rumpled suit and was holding a long-stemmed flower _ a
daisy or something. The stem had been broken in the middle and he
looked pathetic. An hour or so before, he'd been a leader ... a
guru or whatever ... and he was going to lead everybody to a new
world.''
   ``Now,'' concluded Dobrich, who was subsequently tried and
acquitted of federal perjury charges stemming from the disturbance,
``he didn't have anyone around him.''
   By the end of the week, 691 demonstrators had been arrested, 200
protesters were treated for injuries, and an estimated 200 others
never sought treatment for their wounds. The police also paid a
price, with 161 injuries.
   Dellinger would spend a good part of the next few years in
Chicago as one of eight defendants charged with inciting violence
at the 1968 convention.
   The Chicago Seven Trial _ Black Panther leader Bobby Seale's
case was quickly severed from the rest _ opened in September 1969
and quickly became one of the most notorious in recent history.
   The defendants and their attorneys were cited for contempt of
court nearly 200 times. They became a cause celebre, their
convictions overturned in 1972 by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, their paths since as divergent as the motives that brought
them together 20 years ago.
   ``I have no regrets about the '60s whatsoever,'' Abbie Hoffman,
who works as a political organizer, said recently.
   ``The only regrets I have is that we didn't do it deeper, make
it last longer.''

   Abe Peck remembers.
   ``I was editor of the Chicago Seed, the old underground

   ``Word was going around the country that the Yippie `Festival of
Life,' or counterconvention, was going to be `groovy,' as they used

   Deputy Chief of Patrol Carl Dobrich of the Chicago Police, who
served in the convention's disturbance task force:
   ``It was anarchy in the making. There were some good people,
some sincere people, out there in the parks and streets, but there
were many others who were without any leadership and who were just
looking for trouble....''
   On Wednesday, midway through the convention, ``I heard officers
being dispatched to the band shell area in Grant Park, where the
flag was being taken down and replaced with some kind of Viet Cong
banner. One thing kind of led to another. When the officers moved
in, the demonstrators were gathering around (protest leader) David
Dellinger, looking for instructions.
   ``After that skirmish, Dellinger pulled out of the band shell
area, leading his flock, as it were.''
   Some of the crowd headed for the Hilton.
   ``When we went for the first two to haul them away, they lashed
out at the officers arresting them and kicked them. I got kicked
myself.
   ``Then, everything started flying through the air as they
started throwing things _ rocks, shoes ... everything.
   ``A tray full of dishes came flying out the window of one of the
hotel rooms, but I couldn't see from which floor.
   ``Later, I recall seeing Dellinger standing along the curb right

It happened when a line of cops came forward with Dobrich
commanding. A woman had come over ... and was shaking her hand at

   Three-time California Assemblyman Tom Hayden remembers seeing
fellow protest leader Rennie Davis have ``his head split open by
the police while he thought he was trying to calm down or defuse a
potential confrontation at an assembly at the band shell.
   ``Then he was taken away to the hospital, and police came to the
hospital trying to arrest him.
   ``Hospital workers had to hide him and get his head bandaged and
get him into a cab so he could go to an apartment and rest.
   ``Late at night when the demonstrators got from the band shell
to the front of the Hilton, it seemed to be the high point or the
low point... of the weeklong confrontations when they sat down and
the television lights came on and they chanted, `The whole world is
watching.'
   ``I was right there. I was in the group of people that was being
Maced and we backed up and a woman started screaming....
   ``We fell back through the windows of the Haymarket Lounge, and
everyone fell into the Hilton _ and the police came after us
through the broken windows.... It was hard to breathe with the gas
and the Mace... but in any event there was a lot of panic and then
the crowd fell backward ... and everyone fell into the windows.
   ``I guess I wouldn't want to go through those times again.''
   Hayden, Davis, and six others were charged with conspiracy to
incite violence.

   Mitch Kuhn leafs through one of his bound
collections of political buttons, pauses at a page of peace-symbol
pins and reaches 20 years into his memory for a black-and-white
image from August 1968.
   ``I was a peace activist in Milwaukee,'' Kuhn says. ``I had
worked for (Sen. Eugene) McCarthy. And when I saw on television the
McCarthy folks being rousted out of their rooms at the Hilton and
beaten and bloodied _ that goes right to the bottom of your soul.
   ``In hindsight, looking back, I wish I'd have been here.''
   Here: Chicago, 1968, when in the last week of August, thousands
of angry young anti-war protesters upstaged the Democratic National
Convention and the nomination of Hubert Humphrey with violent,
nationally televised clashes with police in the parks and on the
streets.
   Those who were there may remember the stinging tear gas, the
crackling megaphones or the sight of an enraged Mayor Richard J.
Daley leaping to his feet on the convention floor at Connecticut
Sen. Abraham Ribicoff's denunciation of ``Gestapo tactics in the
streets of Chicago.''
   But for those who were not there, the artifacts remain. And for
reasons both economic and emotional, prices for '68 convention
collectibles have risen dramatically.
   Certain Humphrey campaign buttons are worth $150, more than 10
times their book value just 10 years ago. Copies of the Seed,
Chicago's leading underground newspaper of the day, have doubled in
price in less than five years and now sell for about $10 at
rare-book stores.
   As in any market, scarcity increases value. Clean, documented
20-year-old buttons bearing the once-ubiquitous peace symbol go for
$2. But several buttons designed by cartoonist Jules Feiffer to
help raise money to defend the Chicago Seven protest leaders,
charged with conspiracy to incite violence at the convention, go
from $5 to $12.50, depending on their condition.
   Books of the era also are in demand, says Kenan Heise, who owns
Chicago Historical Bookworks in suburban Evanston.
   Typical buyers are people in their late 30s and 40s who shared
the rebellious spirit of the times and yearn for something more
tangible than their memories, says Heise, who recently added a
shelf of out-of-print books by the Chicago Seven.
   ``Trial'' by Tom Hayden, published in 1970 at $1.95, sells for
$15. Abbie Hoffman's 1968 paperback ``Revolution for the Hell of
It,'' published at $1.95, goes for $12.50. Listed at $12 are Jerry
Rubin's ``We Are Everywhere'' (``written secretly in the Cook
County Jail and smuggled out,'' according to a cover blurb) or ``Do
It'' (``Read this book stoned!'').
   There also are memorabilia collectors who just like the way the
stuff looks.
   ``One of the best things to come out of the '60s was the
buttons,'' says Jim Norton, 51, of suburban Oak Park, who collects
anti-Vietnam War pins.
   At the spring meeting of the local chapter of the American
Political Items Collectors, a 2,000-member national organization,
Norton pointed out his favorites, circa 1968: an anti-Lyndon
Johnson button inscribed ``LSD not LBJ;'' a black-and-white pin
bearing a sketch of Uncle Sam with a pistol, and a
red-white-and-blue button showing a dove shedding a bloody tear.
   ``My daughter almost cried when she saw that,'' he said.
   The market for Chicago '68 artifacts is broad enough to include
everything from a comic-book-style copy of poet Allen Ginsberg's
testimony at the Chicago Seven trial _ $25 at Heise's store _ to a
Humphrey-Muskie poster, also $25.
   But some items are valued by their owners beyond any price.
Charles ``Sky'' King, 48, worked as a newspaper film courier during
the convention and remembers steering his motorcycle through the

   They were left-wing activists whose courtroom
antics and commitment to political change reflected a generation of
angry youths disillusioned by a nation in undeclared war thousands
of miles away.
   The defendants who won national attention in the Chicago Seven
trial are middle-aged and grayer now, one the author of a barbecue
cookbook, another a professional party-giver; many are fathers and
husbands.
   But most remain committed to a watered-down brand of the
activism that made them household names 20 years ago.
   ``A lot of people tell me I'm selling out, because I wrote a
cookbook,'' says former Black Panther leader Bobby Seale, 51, whose
``Barbecuing with Bobby'' was recently published.
   ``I say, `Why do you want to pigeonhole me?''' Seale says. ``I
still believe in revolving political and economic power back to the
hands of the people.''
   Seale and seven others were charged with conspiracy to incite
violence in August 1968 at the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
   The 4{-month theatrics featured wild-haired defendants whose
antics included wearing judicial robes to court, taking them off
and stomping on them; and a 74-year-old judge who refused to allow
Seale his own attorney and ordered him bound and gagged in the
courtroom when he protested.
   ``I think it certainly was a microcosm of the times,'' former
defendant John Froines says, ``but it was also theater, so it was
an exaggerated statement of the times as well.
   ``When Abbie Hoffman said that the judge came right out of
central casting, it was true. Instead of them picking a liberal
judge who was very restrained, they picked a very harsh, prejudiced
jurist who in a sense kind of reflected the kind of oppression that
people were ... talking about as being the nature of America at the
time.''
   The case opened in September 1969 and became known as the
Chicago Seven trial when U.S. District Judge Julius Hoffman severed
Seale from the others, convicted him of contempt of court and
sentenced him to four years in prison.
   Five of the other seven defendants _ Rennie Davis, David
Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin _ also were
charged with crossing state lines with intent to riot and were
found guilty in February 1970.
   Froines and Lee Weiner were acquitted. None of the defendants
was convicted of the conspiracy charge.
   The five convictions and Seale's contempt citation later were
overturned by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing errors
by Judge Hoffman and criticizing his courtroom demeanor.
   The seven defendants and their attorneys also were cited for
contempt of court nearly 200 times, but all but 15 of the citations
were dismissed.
   In a 1982 interview, a year before his death at age 87, Judge
Hoffman said the defendants had made a mockery of the nation's
highest trial court.
   Most have no regrets about their behavior during the trial.
   ``I was standing up for the Sixth Amendment of the
Constitution,'' Seale says, ``that every citizen has the right to
have legal counsel of his choice.
   ``I never disrupted the courtroom unless my name was mentioned.
`But judge,' I'd say, `you're a racist facist dog, you denied me my
constitutional rights.'''
   Seale, the father of three, now works in minority recruitment at
Temple University in Philadelphia, where he is doing graduate work
in political science and African-American Studies.
   He also works in a program aimed at getting students into
community service and social action.
   ``I've refined my perspective a lot,'' says Seale. ``I stopped
advocating overthrowing the government when the government stopped
trying to overthrow our organization.''
   He plans to use proceeds from his cookbook to fund scholarships
for minority college students.
   Former Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman, one of the brashest of the
defendants during the trial, remains one of the most politically
involved.
   ``I'm an American dissident,'' says Hoffman, now 51 and the
father of three.

   He has made a career out of political protests and has been
arrested numerous times in recent years in demonstrations against
South African apartheid, environmental hazards and other causes.
   ``I don't think my goals have changed since I was 4 and I fought
schoolyard bullies,'', says Hoffman, who rents a home in New Hope,
Pa.
   Fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin now owns a New York company that
produces parties for yuppies at Manhattan's poshest nightclubs.
   Twenty years ago, Rubin called his indictment ``the Academy
Award of protest.'' At age 50, with a wife and infant daughter, he
says ``My protest days are over.''
   But he's proud of his actions in the days of rebellion. ``We
shook up the country, we fought authority, illegitimate authority.
I woke up the country to immorality in authoritative places.
   ``When I think about it ... I miss the sense of purpose, I miss
the sense of righteous anger. ... But I'm much healthier than I was
then.''
   Co-defendant Lee Weiner says, ``I was political then, I'm
political now.''
   Then, Weiner was a bearded 29-year-old Northwestern University
research assistant and anti-war activist who read books in the
courtroom during the trial.
   Now, he's a 48-year-old father of four and runs a direct-mail
firm in Washington for non-profit organizations and political
clients.
   ``I still consider myself utterly committed to the pursuit of
social justice in the political context,'' says Weiner, who has
taken part in recent protests for more AIDS research and Soviet
Jews.
   Weiner says he and the other defendants ``weren't a bunch of
wild radicals,'' but were dedicated to a belief that ``people can
and should be able to live better together ... and to a ferocious
refusal to accept injustice, as simply a given part of our lives.''
   Froines, now a professor at UCLA's School of Public Health, was
a Yale University graduate with a Ph.D. in chemistry who decided to
spend the summer of 1968 in Chicago with his in-laws before taking
a faculty position in Oregon.
   Froines had done community organizing work with Tom Hayden and
Rennie Davis, and ``decided to get involved'' in the demonstrations.
   ``I'm not an activist now, which isn't to say that I have turned
away from activism,'' says Froines, 48, who served in the Carter
administration as director of toxic substances at the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   ``It's just that it's a different time and place. I still
believe in progressive ideas and try to work that out in a
different context.''
   The father of two, Froines champions environmental health issues
at UCLA and has a 20-year-old daughter who has taken part in campus
activism.
   Davis is in his late 40s and lives in the Denver area, where he
sold life insurance for a while and dabbled in Hinduism.
   Dellinger, 72, a lifelong peace activist, lives in Peacham, Vt.,
and has been active in protests against U.S. involvement in
Nicaragua.
   Hayden, 48, is a three-term California assemblyman who espouses
liberal causes and has been married to actress Jane Fonda for 15
years.
   ``The '60s were a decade of great achievement balanced by agony
and tragedy,'' Hayden says. ``It was a time that was very uplifting
and focusing, and we haven't had a decade like that since.
   ``I've gone in a circle that began in the early '60s and went
from idealism to a bitter hostility to everything the government
was doing back to a renewed idealism. ...
   ``I'm thankful that I've survived and that my sense of idealism
remains, and that I try to be like the person I was at the
beginning of the '60s.''
   Froines says he isn't nostalgic about the '60s but ``would hope
that it would happen again.
   ``Society progresses by people getting angry and doing things.
It was a great period. I feel really strongly that societies need
that kind of tension in order to progress. I think that it was a
very, very good time.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Most people want to live as long as possible and
most want the benefits of the healing arts. But what of those who,
stricken by terminal illness, think otherwise? And those who,
incapable of decisions themselves, linger hopelessly to the
distress of their families? Few questions raise greater
difficulties or more emotional debate. This is the second of three
articles on euthanasia.

   That December night 3{ years ago in the Bahamas,
where Darlena and Bob Risley had traveled in a last, desperate
journey in search of a miracle cure for her cancer, she became so
nauseous and dehydrated that the doctor had to be called.
   At their apartment, the doctor gave her one shot for the nausea
and a second shot to kill the pain in her back and in her stomach
that had swollen larger than during her pregnancy years ago.
   A few hours later, just before midnight on Dec. 5, 1984, Darlena
reached up and put her arms out to her husband. He held her. At
that moment, Darlena Risley stopped breathing at age 41.
   Darlena's suffering haunted Risley so much that he was prepared
to help her die sooner had she asked him for a peaceful end to her
life, even though it would have been a crime. He thought about that
when he returned to California and about the many others who endure
the pain of terminal illness.
   Six months after Darlena's death, the 54-year-old Los Angeles
attorney started a campaign to revise the California Natural Death
Act to legalize active euthanasia and allow physicians to give
terminally ill patients lethal doses of drugs, upon their request
and under certain safeguards.
   Darlena's death inspired Risley to found Americans Against Human
Suffering. The group fell more than 100,000 signatures short of the
number required by the May 8 deadline to get the issue on the
California ballot for November's election. But it still managed to
gather 250,000 names.
   The organization, with another pro-euthanasia group, the Los
Angeles-based National Hemlock Society, is planning to try again in
1990, not only in California, but in Oregon, Washington state and
Florida as well.
   While support for active euthanasia is growing in some segments
of the American population, the opposition remains strong from
leading experts on medical ethics, lawmakers, religious leaders,
doctors and lawyers.
   ``As individuals and as a society, we have the positive
obligation to protect life,'' said Cardinal Joseph Bernardin,
leader of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, in a recent
speech. ``We have the negative obligation not to destroy or injure
human life directly, especially the life of the innocent and the
vulnerable.''
   Four prominent physicians and experts on medical ethics spoke of
``perilous times for our profession'' in a commentary printed in
the April 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association. They cited efforts in court and legislatures to
legalize killing by doctors if patients request it.
   ``Now is the time for the medical profession to rally in defense
of its fundamental moral principles, to repudiate any ... acts of
... intentional killing by physicians and their agents,'' the
commentary said. ``We call on fellow physicians to say that we will
not deliberately kill. And we must say to the broader community
that if it insists on tolerating or legalizing active euthanasia,
it will have to find non-physicians to do its killing.''
   The commentary was in response to an article published in the
journal in which a doctor, whose name was withheld, described how
he killed a 20-year-old woman named Debbie with an injection of
morphine. The woman, like Darlena, was dying of ovarian cancer.
   The commentary was signed by Willard Gaylin, president of the
Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; Leon R. Kass, professor
in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago;
Mark Siegler, director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at
the University of Chicago; and Edmund D. Pellegrino, director of
the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.
   In a telephone interview, Gaylin said he is not opposed to
withdrawing medication or treatment from a dying patient if that's
what he wants, or to giving him pain relievers even if it would
hasten death.
   ``But I don't think doctors should assume the responsibility for
actually killing a patient,'' he said. ``If our society wishes to
condone that, I think it would be best if that were not the
doctor's role. We do allow the patient to do it to himself. Suicide
is no longer a crime in any of the 50 states. Abetting a suicide is
in almost every state.''
   Gaylin suggested that if the public decides that some people
should have the option of euthanasia, then it should be done by a
family member as surrogate for the physician.
   This is precisely what ran through Bob Risley's mind in the
final days of his wife's life. She wanted to live so much that she
withstood surgery four times and chemotherapy as the cancer spread
through her body. She suffered the indignity of having a catheter
inserted into her stomach for eight months through which
chemotherapeutic fluids flooded her abdomen. The doctor had given
her only a year to live. She survived for two.
   A few days before she died, she and Risley had discussed what
they would do if her pain became too great. But no decision was
made except in his own mind.

   ``I had resolved that if she asked me to help her die, I would
have done that, no matter what,'' he says. ``I knew at the time
that would have been a crime in the Bahamas as well as everywhere
in the States.''
   But she never asked him. ``I wasn't forced into that moral
decision which many, many other people have been forced into,'' he
says.
   But even if the patient asks for a lethal dose of drugs, it is
still wrong to accede to the request, according to the guidelines
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington.
   ``It is still an act of homicide on the part of the agent, still
an attack on the dignity of human life,'' says Richard Doerflinger,
director of the conference's Office for Pro-Life Activities. ``And
that is something that no government that's established to protect
life should be allowing.''
   Referring to routine efforts to prevent suicides, he says: ``Our
society has a long tradition of respect for human freedom but we
still send police officers'' to dissuade or grab people threatening
to jump from a bridge, ``out of respect for their lives.
Essentially, this situation is no different.''
   The church does approve, Doerflinger notes, of withdrawing
respirators and other life-support systems in some cases.
   ``The church also teaches that it's legitimate to withdraw
extraordinary means of life support which are means that are
considered excessively burdensome to the patient or which provide
no benefit,'' says Doerflinger. ``Not every withdrawal of life
sustaining treatment is seen as euthanasia.''
   Doerflinger sees a growing support for euthanasia, partly due to
an aging population. ``In the United States, the average married
couple has less than two children and the growing percentage of
elderly people is being seen by others as more of a burden than
they were in the past.''
   What opponents of legalized euthanasia fear is the potential for
abuse and exploitation.
   Giles Scofield, staff counsel for Concerned for Dying, a New
York-based group concerned with care of the terminally ill, says
there is a danger of misreading a patient's wants or needs and of
doctors taking the easy way out.
   ``We're not convinced it's necessary,'' he says. ``A lot of
patients now have rights that aren't being honored. If patients
knew that they could be taken off a respirator or refuse artificial
nutrition ... without having to go to court, in all likelihood they
would not want physician-assisted suicide ... If doctors knew that
an acceptable way of dealing with a terminally ill patient was to
provide a lethal injection, there might be a tendency to substitute
that for compassionate care.''
   Doerflinger says if active euthanasia were legalized, it would
go far beyond the limited population that would now be included in
legislation proposed by Americans Against Human Suffering under
which two doctors must agree that in their judgment the patient
will die within six months.
   ``I don't know of anyone who really thinks the killing of
someone who is thought to have seven months to live could still be
punished as first-degree murder once you've established a policy
that euthanasia for patients expected to die in six months is a
public good,'' Doerflinger argues.
   ``I don't see how society could continue to keep that arbitrary
dividing line. People who wanted euthanasia who expected to die in
seven months, eight months, a year, would claim that they are being
denied their rights.''
   Sissela Bok, the noted author and philosopher, says legalized
active euthanasia would be dangerous for any society.
   ``I think it takes away a very powerful barrier that we have
against one form of violence,'' she says. ``We need a barrier
against different forms of violence but certainly violence against
those who are unable to defend themselves. It could be that some
people would die in a process like this who would not want to die.''
   Opponents also worry that legalized euthanasia would undermine
trust in the doctor's role as healer and lifesaver.
   ``There's a difference between giving a patient a painkiller and
giving a patient a patient killer,'' says Giles Scofield.
   People want to live as long as they can and want the benefit of
the healing arts, says Bob Risley, but when things become hopeless,
``so that there isn't anything else to do, no more treatments, then
making people die through the natural dying process, going through
the agonies in the final few days, seems rather fruitless.''

   Although it's technically against the law,
physicians in the Netherlands are tacitly allowed to practice
active euthanasia, putting an end to terminally ill patients' lives
with a lethal injection.
   The practice there is believed to be more widespread than in any
other country. Experts in the field say they know of no country
where active euthanasia is legal.
   ``But does the law wink at it? Yes, it may in some cases,'' says
Daniel Callahan, a noted author and expert on medical ethics who is
the director of the Hastings Center, a research institute in
Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
   Dr. Pieter Admiraal, a Dutch anesthesiologist at General
Hospital in Delft and a supporter of euthanasia, estimated in a
telephone interview that there are about 5,000 cases of euthanasia
a year in a population of 15 million people. Only a handful of
doctors have been prosecuted, and officially only 140 cases were
reported last year, Admiraal says.
   ``Most doctors fill in the form that it was a natural death,''
he says. Admiraal says that in the last 10 years he has helped more
than 100 patients to die. He faced prosecution only once, but the
charges were dropped.
   ``We are the first in the world to do this kind of experiment,''
he says. ``I think it's done in a lot of countries, always secret
and illegal.''
   Admiraal says doctors can be 95 percent sure the state won't
bother them if they follow certain rules.
   ``The patient must ask for euthanasia more than once,'' he says.
``The patient must be in a normal mental state and suffering
unbearably. It must be a disease which we cannot cure. And the
doctor has to have a second opinion.
   ``We discuss the possibility of euthanasia for a week or so, and
we also have to believe it is the only way. We have a whole team
involved in the decision making. We have to agree there is no other
way to do it. It's not something to decide in an afternoon.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Elliott Abrams is a man not given to compromise
or mincing his words. That has made him a sizable band of political
enemies, especially in his handling of Central American policy,
where the administration's efforts have not notably prospered.
Undaunted, the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs means
to soldier on until the end of President Reagan's term.

<TEXT>
   Elliott Abrams is Ronald Reagan's point man in
the one area where the president's vaunted good luck seems to have
deserted him.
   On no issue have Reagan's policies come under more sustained
assault than in Central America _ Abrams' turf _ but Abrams'
campaigns against cocaine smugglers and what he considers
Cuban-style communism there haven't gotten very far.
   In the process, he has become a lightning rod for policy
opponents' wrath, and he has often found himself the target of
corrosive taunts on Capitol Hill and in the bureaucracy as well.
   Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
looks with pride on the democratic gains made through much of the
hemisphere, but his efforts to dislodge two determined adversaries
_ Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and Nicaragua's Sandinista
government _ seem to have misfired.
   The policies Abrams has pursued are no less controversial than
his style. Although he's only 40, few have seen more intellectual
combat than he has.
   Few neutrals emerge when Abrams is the subject of conversation.
A sampling of opinions: He's arrogant. He's brilliant. He's
untrustworthy. He's courageous. He's unscrupulous. He's principled.
   ``I don't like the man,'' says former Ambassador Frank McNeil,
using a stronger noun.
   ``I wish him a long life,'' says Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   Abrams has never been accused of obsequiousness in dealing with
people who disagree with him.
   ``This is a political battlefield,'' he says. ``The opposition
fights with every weapon available and we need to fight equally
hard.''
   Off duty, the Abrams glower so familiar to opponents disappears,
as does the mantle of the no-apologies crusader.
   Dawn finds him toasting frozen waffles for his three small
children (on weekends he makes French toast from scratch). Late at
night, he can be found curled up with a novel. But, during working
hours, it's the combat zone.
   The combat zone was livelier than usual during the Iran-Contra
hearings last year. It developed that Abrams had earlier misled
Congressional committees about fund solicitations for the Contras
and U.S. involvement in an ill-fated resupply flight for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   From the Democratic camp came predictable cries for Abrams'
resignation. He didn't oblige.
   Some blame him for the administration's more recent policy
setbacks, accusing him of flawed tactics and an abrasive style that
alienates potential allies. His supporters fault Congress as balky
and shortsighted, ``irresolute'' friends in Latin America, hostile
media, bureaucratic infighting and the intractable nature of the
problems he inherited.
   Abrams is a ``neoconservative.'' He worked for two Democratic
senators _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the late Henry
Jackson of Washington state _ and, in the 1980 campaign, for the
election of Ronald Reagan. He is a native of New York City and a
product of Harvard.
   Abram's wife, Rachel, is the daughter of Norman Podhoretz,
editor of Commentary magazine, and Midge Decter, a champion of
conservative causes.
   After defecting to the Republican Party, he joined the
administration in 1981, becoming, at age 33, the youngest person
ever with the rank of assistant secretary of state. He has had that
title as head of three bureaus _ international organizations, human
rights and, since 1985, Latin America.
   American aid to the anti-Sandinista cause has been an article of
faith with Abrams. When Congress last February rejected further
military shipments to the Contras, Abrams thought it would
undermine them in negotiations with their foes _ perhaps fatally.
   The next blow came in May, with the collapse of Abrams'
negotiating efforts to induce Noriega's departure. It was
especially painful since Abrams had seen there a chance to further
democracy in the hemisphere while ridding Panama of a leader who
was under indictment in the United States on drug-dealing charges.

   According to Abrams' script, American diplomatic and economic
pressure, coupled with discontent among the Panamanian people,
would be enough to topple Noriega. It didn't happen. Panama is left
with a wounded economy and Noriega firmly in charge.
   ``Abrams misread Noriega very badly,'' says McNeil, former
ambassador to Costa Rica and one of his more persistent critics.
Abrams' approach regarded Panamanians as ``little brown brothers''
to be pushed around with a little muscle-flexing, he says _
``incredible ineptitude.''
   Abrams' backers contend his hand was weakened by a campaign of
leaks from the Justice Department and the Pentagon to undercut his
grand design. McNeil's suggestion that Noriega's abdication could
best be achieved by a Latin American -led negotiating team is
dismissed as ``balderdash'' by Hyde, one of Abrams' staunchest
supporters.
   Abrams assumed his duties three years ago, determined to try to
overcome what he saw as a decline in American political will and
leverage in Central America. Like Reagan, he was convinced that the
Nicaraguan government, left unchecked, would spread its revolution
and ultimately present national security dangers to the United
States.
   In pursuing his objectives, Abrams was never tongue-tied in
responding to his critics. One congressman's suggestion that the
administration was unconcerned over the murder of four American
churchwomen in El Salvador he called ``not only false, but I would
say malicious and bordering on the vicious.''
   He upbraided another: ``Blame America. Blame America. Never
blame the Communists.''
   Talking with a reporter in his sixth-floor State Department
office, Abrams insists that he doesn't seek confrontation for its
own sake.
   But, he says, ``I have never understood that my function here
was to take the president's views and water them down sufficiently
so that they'd be more popular in Congress.''
   He'd be delighted to solicit bipartisanship, he says, but the
Democratic Party leadership had decided, ``before I got here,''
that this was impossible on Central America.
   It's not just the Democrats, though. He's critical of colleagues
in the administration who, he claims, fail to toe the line in
support of Reagan's policies but tend to accommodate the
president's ideological opponents because they have a personal
agenda stretching beyond the president's tenure: Lucrative jobs in
private business after their government service ends.
   ``I don't think that is why tens of thousands of people worked
their fingers to the bone getting Ronald Reagan elected, so that
guys like me could come to Washington and meet lots of people and
get a good law firm job,'' he says.
   ``We're supposed to pursue policies and if there are people in
the press or in Congress or in so-called human rights groups who
don't like it, too bad.''
   The people who don't like Abrams almost succeeded in dislodging
him from his office.
   ``They had a good shot in June '87,'' Abrams says. ``They almost
got me. They've only had one shot since then, in April when
everybody was blaming me for Panama.''
   June '87 refers to his testimony before the committees
investigating the Iran-Contra affair. In October 1986, Abrams had
denied U.S. government involvement in a Contra resupply flight that
was shot down over Nicaragua, leading to the capture of an American
soldier of fortune.
   Abrams said later he had not been informed that the flight was
part of the Contra aid network created by Lt. Col. Oliver North,
the former National Security Council aide.
   In June 1987, he testified before the congressional committees
investigating the Iran-Contra affair and called his misstatements
``completely honest and completely wrong.''
   In November 1986, Abrams told the Senate Intelligence Committee
that the United States had not asked third countries for money for
the Contras. In fact, as the June hearings brought out, Abrams
himself solicited a $10 million contribution from Brunei, a tiny,
oil-rich sultanate in Southeast Asia.
   He apologized to the committee, explaining that he had promised
Brunei confidentiality, and he admitted his handling of the matter
had been foolish.
   One Democratic representative who is unmollified is George
Crockett of Detroit, who heads the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs. He won't allow Abrams to
testify without swearing him in first, ``so we can at least go
through the motions of trying to believe what he's testifying to.''
   Wayne Smith, a former head of the U.S. diplomatic mission to
Cuba, calls Abrams a man ``willing to lie and misrepresent the
facts about anything.''
   Robert Kagan, a former deputy to Abrams, puts such attacks down
to political and ideological differences. ``The liberal
intelligentsia hates Elliott Abrams because he is the most
articulate spokesman for administration policy,'' he says. ``He is
a person of unique personal strength and strength of conviction.''
   Nevertheless there are some people at the White House, too, who
would like to see him replaced, Abrams believes. But enjoying the
full support of Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, he
says he'll stay on board until the president's term is up.
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Smelling salts and artificial intelligence are
just a couple of things researchers are willing to try in an
attempt to stem blackouts among military pilots traveling faster
than sound.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the nation's military jet fighter
pilots have been breaking the sound barrier and evading supersonic
missiles, a deadly invader has crept into the cockpit.
   It strikes when they are at the top of their performance, maybe
in the middle of a dogfight, pulling turns that would make the
roughest roller coaster seem like a carriage ride in the park.
   Then they lose to GLOC (pronounced G-lock), gravity-induced loss
of consciousness.
   It begins as a pilot starts to feel the crushing weight from a
sharp turn, or maybe a dive. In a modern fighter such as the F-16,
maneuvers can lead to forces of 9 Gs, nine times the force of
gravity.
   The blood becomes so heavy the heart can't pump it; it drains
from the brain. Things go gray; the pilot may suffer tunnel vision.
Then black.
   ``It's almost always fatal,'' says Maj. Rocky Hill of the Air
Force Inspection and Safety Center at Norton Air Force Base, Calif.
   He says there have been at least 13 GLOC crashes since 1982, all
but one fatal.
   ``We got so smart on it so fast and started running people
through the centrifuge (for training), and we said this is a real
success story. But it never really goes away,'' Hill said during a
seminar on prevention at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
   It becomes worse with a new generation of planes, the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Navy's Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, planned for the next decade with more mind-numbing
capabilities.
   Pilots already are overloaded with computer screens, switches,
gauges and dials, and GLOC is just one more worry.
   ``The cockpit is becoming an increasingly hostile area to the
pilot,'' Hill says.
   Robert E. van Patten, leader of GLOC research at the Armstrong
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson, says
Germans put meters in their Ju-88 dive bombers in World War II to
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness.
   ``All in all, we aren't that far ahead,'' van Patten says.
   Hill says GLOC gained priority again about four years ago when
video cameras were put in cockpits. They captured pilots coming
close to GLOC.
   Susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time, but
relatively few hours in very-high performance aircraft. They tend
to be middle-aged and have had little training on the centrifuge,
Hill says.
   ``These profiles very accurately describe our Air Force Reserve
and Air National Guard units that have converted to the F-16,''
Hill says.
   Fatigue also is a big factor, researchers say, which could pose
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime.
   Beginning in August, the Air Force plans to train about 2,500
pilots per year _ fledglings and veterans _ on a new centrifuge at
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M.
   Part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back
up.
   So does the G-suit, a corset-like garment inflated to keep blood
from pooling in the legs. Soon to come is positive-pressure
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to
exhale.
   But even if a pilot does recover from GLOC, it can take up to
two minutes to regain his bearings. So scientists are looking at
ways to tell the airplane's computer that the pilot is unconscious
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety.
   McDonnell Aircraft Co. says it is near a system that keys on a
pilot's breathing and voice patterns, combined with a computer
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane, to tell when a pilot
is at GLOC risk.
   Van Patten's group is trying more complicated sensors, possibly
in helmets, that would measure head slump, eye blink, blood
pressure, pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick.
Those researchers want to use more extensive artificial
intelligence, including neural networks _ computers based on the
architecture of the brain _ to make more accurate judgments.
   A pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the
system exactly for him, van Patten says.
   To revive a pilot, researchers are studying ways to pulsate the
G-suit, administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates
blood vessels and raises blood pressure.
   ``Perhaps even plain old smelling salts,'' says van
Patten.``They have a long and honorable history.''
   But most of all, a recent study shows, pilots want a system that
they won't have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and
that they can override if it starts to malfunction.
   Van Patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built
for $500,000, and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another $3
million. But in the current budget climate, he says, money is hard
to come by.

   TV audiences will soon get their first real
chance to hear pianist Vladimir Feltsman, who emigrated to America
last summer after much publicized difficulties in getting out of
Russia. On Wednesday, July 13, he will perform in a ``Live from
Lincoln Center'' telecast on PBS.
   ``This will be my first purely musical TV event,'' says the
36-year-old Feltsman. ``Playing in the White House (Sept. 27) and
my debut at Carnegie Hall (Nov. 11) were shown on the news, a
little. I was on the `60 Minutes' show. It was more talking than
music.''
   The Mostly Mozart Festival, now in its 22nd year at Avery Fisher
Hall, will open with Feltsman on Tuesday, July 12. The program will
be repeated on Wednesday night and televised live.
   ``Mostly Mozart is one of the leading music festivals in the
world. I am very pleased I have been invited,'' says Feltsman. ``I
will play Mozart's `Piano Concerto in B flat major,' the last by
Mozart. He was composing it at the same time he was composing `The
Magic Flute.' It is an absolute masterpiece.
   ``Then Frederica von Stade will sing something, and then we will
do an aria by Mozart together, so I think it will be fun.''
   Since arriving in America, Feltsman has played 60 performances.
``This season has been very special for me,'' he says, ``because I
am doing everything for the first time _ the first time in
Philadelphia, Israel, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles.''
   Feltsman was considered one of the Soviet Union's best young
pianists when he applied, in April 1979, for an emigration visa.
That year, he says, 52,000 Soviet Jews emigrated. But his
application was denied. Two hours after he applied, Moscow radio
and TV stations were ordered not to play his records. All his
concerts were canceled for two years. Then for the next six years,
Feltsman was allowed to give a few concerts, one such in a factory
where machinery all but drowned out his music.
   On June 14, 1982, Feltsman supporters, who knew him through
recordings and European concerts, scheduled his ``New York debut,''
to publicize his plight. Misha Dichter played that evening.
   Five years later, Feltsman's emigration was approved. Alice
Chandler, president of the State University of New York in New
Paltz, who had looked up Feltsman when she visited Russia,
telephoned to offer him a job. Feltsman, his wife Anna and son
Daniel arrived in New York last August.
   Their 5-year-old son is settled into nursery school and already
finds it easier to speak English than Russian. As for his and his
wife's adjustment, Feltsman says, ``We came here more or less well
prepared. We were not looking for some miracles. We understand that
it is a beautiful country with many problems, which we all know.
   ``Paradise does not exist in the world, as we also know. For
people of my occupation, my mentality, my psychology, my ability,
I'm certain it is still the best place in the world.''
   Feltsman's debut with symphony orchestra was in February with
Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic. ``From then till this
fall I'm playing 10 different concertos and three different recital
programs. It's a little bit tough.''
   In May, Feltsman played a piano sonata by Alfred Schnittke. The
Soviet composer and his wife were allowed to travel to New York for
the occasion. ``This single fact assured me about glasnost much
more than speeches made by Soviet officials,'' he says. ``A few
years ago such a visit of a leading Soviet composer and playing by
a Jewish immigrant was unimaginable. Now it is real. I hope such a
normal attitude will go forward.''
   In addition to his concerts, Feltsman is cutting records and
talking about a special school for budding American pianists. He
has made two recordings already and soon will make two more.
   ``I think recording is one of the most important parts of the
life of a musician,'' he says. ``The performing artist plays, and
it is disappearing in air. Now I'm already thinking, not about
success, but about leaving some legacy.''
   Part of that legacy, too, could be a special program for
promising young American pianists. Of those he's worked with, he
says, ``Their main trouble, even for the best I heard, is their
training at a very early age. If you miss something at 6, 7, 8 or
9, technically, physically, psychologically, you will never get it
back later.''
   Feltsman has talked with some wealthy people about endowing a
school, free but available only to the most gifted.
   ``With such things as music, if you want to get good results you
have to be very tough at the beginning,'' he says. ``And the
principle has to be talent, not ability to pay. You cannot buy a
musical gift with money.''
   Asked whether he'll be nervous about the Mostly Mozart opening
and televised concert, Feltsman says, ``I am very nervous always.
   ``Probably that's the way you have to pay for the joy to play
the music.''

   At dinner two years ago, a friend told David
Henry Hwang a bizarre tale that had made headlines in Europe but
received little attention in the United States.
   A French diplomat falls in love with a Chinese actress in
Beijing. They carry on an affair for 20 years. He later is arrested
in France on espionage charges. At the trial, it is revealed that
the actress is a man who was coerced into the liaison by the
Chinese government. The diplomat claims he didn't know she was a he.
   ``The story had a kind of resonance that appealed to me,'' Hwang
says of what turned into ``M. Butterfly,'' winner of the 1988 Tony
Award as best play of the season. ``So I initially thought of doing
it as a musical.''
   Hwang approached producer Stuart Ostrow who once had brought
Hwang, composer Philip Glass and designer Eiko Ishioka together for
a musical project that didn't pan out.
   Hwang thought about the story for two months and decided to
dovetail the spy drama with the plot of Puccini's ``Madama
Butterfly.'' He sent a two-page outline to Ostrow. It contained the
axis of the plot, particularly the idea of the French man thinking
of himself as Pinkerton and the actress as Butterfly.
   The outline became a play _ written in about six weeks _ rather
than a musical because Hwang didn't want to go through the lengthy
process of finding a composer and lyricist.
   ``I did no research on the story itself because the fact that
the incident existed was enough for me,'' he says. ``I wanted to
interpret it in my own way. Instead, I did a lot of research on the
period _ what type of secrets could have been passed in the early
'60s, the origins of the Vietnam War and what was going on in
China.''
   Before the end of 1986, Ostrow optioned the play for production.
John Dexter, director of ``Equus,'' came aboard in 1987, and a year
was spent casting and raising the $1.2 million needed to bring the
play to New York. When it opened in March 1988 at the Eugene
O'Neill Theater, John Lithgow was starred as the hapless diplomat
and B.D. Wong played the exotic Chinese opera singer.
   ``Broadway always was the goal,'' Hwang says. ``I thought this
was a play that had some commercial potential, but it had never
occurred to me, growing up and working in the non-profit theater,
that you could initiate a production on Broadway.''
   ``M. Butterfly'' is the first Broadway play for the 30-year-old
Hwang, even though he has had extensive credits off-Broadway. He
made his mark there in the early 1980s with plays about
Chinese-Americans such as ``FOB,'' ``The Dance and the Railroad''
and ``Family Devotions.''
   Hwang was raised as a musician, not a writer. His first theater
experiences were playing violin in the pit orchestra for amateur
musicals. But at age 12, he wrote a detailed family history,
divided into three generations.
   ``My mother's family were wealthy Chinese merchants who went to
the Philippines in the 19th century,'' Hwang says. ``My father's
family came from Shanghai where my paternal grandfather was a
businessman.''
   Hwang's parents arrived in the United States to go to school _
his father to study business at the University of Southern
California, his mother to study piano. They met at a foreign
students' dance at USC.
   Hwang was born in Los Angeles and grew up in a comfortable
California suburb. He has two younger sisters, one a cellist and
the other an elementary school teacher.
   Hwang's father wanted him to study business in college. But he
ended up at Stanford which didn't have an undergraduate business
program, so he majored in English literature.
   ``I started writing plays in college,'' Hwang says.``I liked the
idea of creating a world which then would exist in front of you.''
   In 1978, he studied writing with Sam Shepard and Maria Irene
Fornes at the fledgling Padua Hills Playwrights Festival in
Claremont, Calif.
   ``It was a real mind opener for me,'' Hwang says. ``They helped
me get in touch with my subconscious, in terms of using the
subconscious to influence your work and give your characters life.''
   Out of the festival came ``FOB,'' the story of a young Chinese
man _ ``fresh off the boat'' _ coming to United States to live with
his Chinese-American relatives. The play was first performed at his
Stanford dormitory, and during his senior year it was accepted by
the National Playwrights Conference in Connecticut. From there in
the summer of 1979, ``FOB'' was picked up by the New York
Shakespeare Festival for production in New York in 1980.
   ``After that, I kind of had a career,'' Hwang says. ``I've
always been able to make a living as a writer. It's been a
combination of the play writing, some film and television writing
and grants.''
   Now he's cautiously enjoying his fame as a Tony Award-winning
playwright.
   ``I had a vaccination against this at a younger age,'' Hwang
says. ``When I was in my early 20s, I had a certain amount of work
done. Not at this level, but I got a certain amount of attention
and dealt with these things at a smaller level. I like to think
that I'm more prepared.''
   Since the opening of ``M. Butterfly,'' Hwang has turned his
attention to a new music-theater monologue he is creating with
Glass and designer Jerome Sirlin. It's called ``1,000 Airplanes on
the Roof'' and concerns the unlikely subject of UFO abductions. The
piece, starring actor Rocco Sisto, premieres in Vienna this month
and comes to the United States in September.
   Hwang, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Ophelia, would
like to get back to writing his next play. One already has been
commissioned by the South Coast Repertory of Costa Mesa, Calif.,
which received a Tony this year as outstanding regional theater.
   ``When I'm working on a play, the play determines the hours,''
he says. ``I can write continuously. Consequently, I can finish my
plays fairly quickly, usually between three and six weeks.''
   Hwang feels he gradually has been able to get attention as a
playwright, not a Chinese-American playwright.
   ``I feel less like a spokesman for Asian-American playwrights
than I did the last time around,'' says Hwang, referring to the
days when ``FOB'' and ``The Dance and the Railroad'' first
attracted attention. ``Those early plays were specifically
Chinese-American.
   ``Today, I am less inclined to accept the role of spokesman for
the Asian-American community. Once, I felt duty-bound to fulfill
it. Now I feel it's not really possible for me to be any kind of
spokesman for any view other than my own.''

   The view from the congested highways of the
Pearl River Delta reveals the stuff of which dreams are made
elsewhere in China.
   Spacious multilevel homes of the newly rich dot delta towns.
   Scores of new factories are under construction.
   Power lines crisscross the countryside as authorities try
desperately to supply the area's growing economy.
   The fertile delta, an area slightly larger than Maryland and
centered around this port in Guangdong province 90 miles upriver
from Hong Kong, is fast outpacing other regions in the drive to
transform China from a backward to a developed nation by the turn
of the century.
   While Communist Party leaders hope the rest of the country will
eventually catch up, peasants from China's vast interior are not
waiting and have flooded the delta looking for work.
   Part of the area's success can be traced to its historic role as
China's window to the world: Canton was the center of trade between
Imperial China and the West while generations of Guangdong men
traveled overseas to seek their fortune through gritty hard work.
   So when government leaders in Beijing decided nearly a decade
ago to open China's doors to the outside world and to encourage
private enterprise, the adventurous Cantonese responded
enthusiastically.
   ``After the Cultural Revolution this area was the earliest to
open up,'' said Deputy Mayor Lei Yu of Canton, referring to the
1966-76 ultra-leftist campaign that left the national economy in a
shambles.
   ``Foreign things are accepted more readily,'' he said in an
interview. ``The people here can easily absorb and digest things
from the outside world which are suitable for us.''
   Many of the 20 million overseas Chinese with ties to Guangdong
province donated money for schools, roads and hospitals. They also
built houses for relatives and set up joint-venture businesses in
ancestral villages.
   In Jiangmen, a city about 40 miles south of Canton, which is the
ancestral home of many Chinese in San Francisco, overseas donations
have reached about $128 million since 1979.
   ``These people, although they don't believe in communism, love
their hometowns,'' said Ding Lisong, deputy secretary general of
Guangdong, a province of 55 million people.
   Perhaps the biggest boost to the delta has come from Hong Kong,
situated at the mouth of the Pearl River. Most of the British
colony's 5.7 million people are ethnic Chinese with family links to
the province.
   Hong Kong businessmen, facing a labor shortage as the colony's
export industries prosper, have turned the delta into a backyard
workshop where thousands of factories do simple, low-technology
assembly work on toys, textiles and other products.
   ``The labor is cheap and we can handle the products in time,''
explained Lin Taozhu, director of the Cha Shan Clothes and Toys
Mill in Dongguan city. Private motorcycles weave along provincial
roads, while color televisions sets and refrigerators have long
lost their novelty. Expensive consumer items such as compact disc
players and silk French shirts are available for the more affluent
in Canton shops and street markets.
   A report carried by Hong Kong's China News Service last year
said conspicuous consumption by Guangdong farmers had become a
serious problem because funds that should have been used for
production investment were spent on consumer goods.
   The delta's businessmen say there's nothing wrong with
accumulating wealth and dismiss suggestions their activity is at
odds with Chinese communism.
   Zhang Chengjian, whose tiled home in Nanhai county is topped by
a 13-foot-diameter antenna that gets television signals from Hong
Kong and much of southern China, claims he made 120,000 yuan
($32,250) in 1987 from the electronics business he started eight
years ago.
   ``Now I've got so much money, even if I don't work I can
survive, but since I have talent in this field I have to make a
contribution to society,'' he said.
   He added that if a new television antenna he is developing ``is
popular in the market, then I will be very happy and the people
will be happy to buy the product.''
   Peasants from the Chinese interior are migrating to the region
by the hundreds of thousands in search of a piece of the economic
pie, but provincial official Ding says they are helping alleviate
an ``acute shortage of labor.''
   An estimated 320,000 people from every Chinese province except
Tibet had flocked to Dongguan through April, according to city
officials.
   At the Cha Shan Clothes and Toys Mill, about three-fifths of the
workers came from outside the area. The factory floor is filled
with young women who left rural China to make money for families
back home.
   ``There's not that much work in the countryside,'' 21-year-old
Long Dingxiang of neighboring Hunan province said as she worked a
sewing machine making ears for toy bunnies. She said at least half
her earnings, which fluctuate from around 100 yuan ($27) to about
400 yuan ($108) monthly, go back to her seven-member family.
   Chen Zhaoxiang, 22, has worked at the adjacent Cha Shan Kam
Shing Toys Factory for three years. She makes at least 210 yuan
($57) a month doing quality control, more than twice what she made
as a primary schoolteacher in Deqing county, more than 125 miles to
the east.
   While standing over a box of U.S.-bound stuffed singing grapes,
Miss Chen said she not only sends money to her younger siblings
back home but has 400 yuan ($107) in a bank account, a sum that is
much more than usual to have in the bank in China.
   Typically, the workers come to the delta on one-year contracts
and are paid piecework wages, living in simple dormitories provided
by their employers. Many young women return home after a few years
of work to get married, perhaps taking with them money for a dowry,
officials said.
   The mass migration to the delta has created social problems,
several local officials say, as some people arriving from other
provinces contribute to prostitution and other crime.
   Although grumbling about the inequalities created by the
government's economic reforms can be heard elsewhere in China,
delta officials believe there is no turning back and are drafting
bigger plans for the future.
   Jiangmen official Du said overseas Chinese who want to invest in
their home towns now are urged to help set up joint-venture
businesses instead of donating money.
   In Dongguan, officials want to move into higher technology
industries, such as manufacturing computer parts, electronic
products and high-quality cloth.
   And the delta's people? They just want to make more money.

<HEAD>Canton Swings while the Rest of China Sleeps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While China sleeps, Canton swings.
   It is the nation's neon-lit nightlife capital, where people dine
and dance into the wee hours.
   Cantonese are known for ``going all out to make money and going
all out to enjoy it,'' explained 24-year-old singer Yuan Jun,
originally from the northern city of Harbin some 1,800 miles away.
   ``In the rest of China, most people are asleep by 10 p.m.,''
said Yuan, exaggerating just a bit. ``In Canton, in the middle of
the night there are still plenty of places to go,'' he added,
exaggerating not at all.
   Per capita disposable income in Canton, the steamy Pearl River
port capital of southeastern Guangdong province, was 1,416 yuan
($381) last year, or 175 percent above the national average.
   Many Canton residents use their pocket money to go dancing at
one of the city's ballrooms, which number 135 by government count.
   On a recent Saturday night, the Nanfang Dance Hall was packed
with customers paying 10 yuan ($2.69) each to swing to Cantonese
hits. Three separate seatings of 250 people each were scheduled for
the evening, with the closing set for 3:45 a.m.
   The city's electronic game rooms also were busy. Most of the 11
machines by the Yonghan Theater were in use at 30 fen (8 cents) a
game, typically bringing in 200 yuan ($54) on a busy day.
   Streets near the popular district along the Pearl River were
full of people well past midnight, with many strollers stopping to
drink tea or snack at the sidewalk restaurants that stay open as
late as 3 a.m.
   Even ``cruising'' has come to Canton, a city of about 3 million
people. Two men pulled a sedan up to a pair of young women walking
outside the Nanfang and beckoned them inside. The women hesitated,
but finally climbed in.
   Prostitution and gambling, which Communist authorities in
Beijing spent years trying to stamp out, also have returned to the
Canton region. Guangdong province recorded 5,600 cases of venereal
disease last year, up three times from 1986.
   Canton seems more in step with the capitalist British colony of
Hong Kong, about 90 miles to the southeast, than with Beijing, the
national capital where most restaurants close by 8 p.m. and people
spend their summer evenings playing chess and cards under street
lights.
   Does Canton's lust for fun and games mean communist morals are
on the decline? At least one top city official scoffs at the notion
that dancing and communism are incompatible.
   Deputy Mayor Lei Yu says Canton's people work hard during the
day and are entitled to relax at nights.
   Invoking the names of the two men primarily responsible for
bringing communism to China, Lei ends the argument: ``Mao Tse-tung
danced and so did (Red Army leader) Zhu De.''

<BYLINE>A Look At The Home Of GWTW, Hartsfield and Ted Turner
^By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city the Democrats have picked for the
nomination of the 41st president _ they hope _ is known to
outsiders as the home of ``Gone With The Wind,'' one very busy
airport and three historically rotten sports teams.
   To those who live here, Atlanta is a city that's easy on the
eyes and fairly low on stress, once even winning Rand McNally's
``most liveable'' designation. A city with no hurricanes and very
little snow. A city that has always taken a great deal of pride in
itself, despite the problems that plague many counterparts: crime,
poverty and the rest.
   Metro Atlanta, with no mountains or oceans to stop it, spreads
in every direction across 18 counties, where about 2.5 million
people live _ 41 percent of Georgia's population. With around
425,000 in the city itself, most ``Atlantans'' actually live in the
suburbs. The average house costs $100,000, and the average salary
is a shade over $19,000.
   Not much is left of Atlanta from the Civil War days _ indeed,
its burning at the hands of Union forces made a spectacular scene
in ``GWTW,'' as the locals are wont to abbreviate the movie.
   Yes, Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport is entrenched in
an ongoing battle with Chicago's O'Hare for the ``nation's
busiest'' title. But it is, after all, an airport, and you do not
often think about it.
   The world's most accurate perception of life in Atlanta may be
of its sporting life. The Braves, the Falcons and the Hawks really
have been, through their history, pretty rotten. In Atlanta's 23
years as a ``big league city,'' through 75 seasons _ including
eight by the Flames hockey team, which up and left _ citizens have
yet to be inconvenienced by the rigors of lining up for tickets to
a championship game.
   (A long-dead soccer team, the Atlanta Chiefs, did play for a
championship once _ and won _ but you didn't exactly have to camp
out to get in.)
   To get around, Atlantans get in the car. The city enjoys an
extensive bus system and a clean, fast train operation, but trains
serve only four lines, which end at commuter lots in the suburbs,
and the system covers only two counties.
   Two other heavily populated suburban counties, Cobb and
Gwinnett, have rejected joining MARTA, the Metropolitan Atlanta
Rapid Transit Authority. The most often stated reasons are fear of
crime and taxes, although it is widely understood that more than a
few in Atlanta's white suburbs fear the train will bring blacks
into their neighborhoods.
   That's a painful admission for a city that then-Mayor William B.
Hartsfield, during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s,
called ``the city too busy to hate.''
   But Atlanta struggles still with racism.
   The city itself is 66 percent black; the 18-county metro area is
74 percent white. While the metro area's cost-of-living ranks
eighth best among the nation's large urban areas, the city itself
is the second-poorest in the nation, with 28 percent of its people
living in poverty.
   Although metro Atlanta's school systems and public places are
integrated, most individual schools and neighborhoods are not. And
in the housing projects of the inner city, the drug trade and its
attendant crime make regular headlines.
   The city's elected leadership is predominantly black, a point of
pride for those surveying civil rights gains in the United States.
But it is not untroubled: two Fulton County commissioners are
facing jail terms for vote-selling convictions, including A.
Reginald Eaves, who was public safety commissioner under Atlanta's
first black mayor, Maynard Jackson.
   The city has sustained a major business boom for the past three
decades, the root of its ``too busy to hate'' boast.
   Ted Turner's once-homey little TV station, which once used a dog
as a co-host of the news, has grown into a global news and
communications empire known as Cable News Network. City fathers in
the mid-'60s built a major-league sports stadium before they had a
team to put in it.
   The same booster spirit was evidenced earlier this year when
Atlanta surprised even itself by winning designation as the U.S.
candidate to host the 1996 Summer Olympics.
   Atlantans like to say, with a knowing smile, that their city is
``a nice place to live, but you wouldn't want to visit here.''
However, tourist attractions can be found.
   Metro Atlanta has Stone Mountain, a mammoth granite hill with a
popular park surrounding it, and the Memorial Arts Center, home of
the High Museum of Art and the award-winning Atlanta Symphony
Orchestra.
   There is also the restored birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr.
and the nearby King Center; the Carter Presidential Center, home of
the former president's museum, library and policy forum, and an
increasing number of nightclubs, bars and first-quality restaurants.
   Atlanta also has 100 Waffle House restaurants, which ``lead the
WORLD in serving T-bone Steaks, Grits and Waffles,'' and a
mystifying number of Mexican restaurants. The Varsity, meanwhile,
bills itself as the world's largest drive-in restaurant.
   Atlanta has Piedmont Park, a tranquil lawn surrounded by the
commotion of the city in the manner of New York's Central Park. It
has Grant Park, which contains an ambitiously renovating zoo and
the Cyclorama, the world's largest painting, depicting the Civil
War's Battle of Atlanta.
   And Atlanta, after all, does have National League baseball, a
National Football League team, and a representative of the National
Basketball Association. You can cheer a Dale Murphy home run or a
Dominique Wilkins slam dunk.
   Tickets aren't that hard to get.

<HEAD>Security Measures Aimed at the Potential Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizers of the Democratic National Convention
are preparing for the worst _ assassination attempts, larcenous
ladies of the evening and massive demonstrations _ in hopes that
all their work will be for naught.
   ``We can't always predict. We have to assume that someone will
try to do something and we have to try to minimize that
possibility. We can't guarantee anything,'' said Dick Murphy, head
of the DNC security advisory committee.
   Last month, the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management
Agency held drills on how to respond to 179 possible disasters
ranging from riots to spills of nuclear materials during the
convention.
   In addition, state, county and local police have been taking
special courses in anti-terrorist tactics, crowd control and arrest
procedures.
   And downtown hotels say they are increasing hotel security,
especially late at night, to prevent room burglaries and keep out
prostitutes.
   Even the rapid rail transit stop at the Omni International, the
convention site, will be closed to discourage would-be terrorists.
   About 35,000 people are expected for the July 18-21 convention.
The total number isn't a city record for a convention, but a major
political event tends to attract thousands of demonstrators with a
range of causes.
   In response, the city has taken over a 85,000-square-foot
parking lot across the street from the convention site and wants to
limit demonstrations to that space, allocating 90 minutes per group
on a first-come, first-serve basis.
   Current plans call for demonstrations in the lot between 9 a.m.
and midnight each day. The city will provide stage and sound
equipment.
   Despite the arrangement, Atlanta Police Maj. W.W. Holley, who is
in charge of security for the area, said the city has not ruled out
the possibility of large parades and demonstrations similar to
those at the 1984 convention in San Francisco.
   But he says, ``we will not have a convention like they had in
Chicago,'' referring to the riot-scarred Democratic gathering in
1968.
   Murphy declined to give the number of federal, state, county and
local security people assigned to convention duty, but The Atlanta
Journal and Constitution reported that 1,350 police officers would
be involved.
   Gene Guererro, state director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said his group is recruiting about 100 volunteer lawyers to
help people who are arrested.
   ``We don't know who is going to come or how many. We have been
encouraging people to apply for applications (to demonstrate),'' he
said.
   Murphy, a veteran of Democratic conventions, said current
controversies do not match the emotional levels of the Vietnam War
and the early stages of the civil rights movement.
   In addition, the relationship between the two contenders for the
nomination, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, is basically
cordial. ``The best I've seen since 1952,'' Murphy said.

<HEAD>Democrats Will Leave Financial Impact On Atlanta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local leaders figure the Democratic National
Convention will make a $60 million impact on Atlanta's economy and
the Democratic Party hopes to cash in too.
   In addition, business owners are hoping to take advantage of the
presence in town of so many political and corporate decision-makers
by doing a little lobbying on their own behalf.
   The party itself is selling rights to use the convention logo on
various souvenirs _ including a official, licensed, party-approved
donkey call.
   One study done in conjunction with Atlanta's bid for the
convention estimated that the overall economic impact will be $58.7
million. A second study placed the amount at $64.3 million. It all
depends on how many thousands of people actually show up.
   Less measurable is the amount of business that might be done as
a result of contacts during convention week.
   But Barry King, Atlanta Chamber of Commerce vice president for
communications, says that ``every high-roller in political circles
will be here.''
   ``It's an opportunity for Atlanta to be seen and Atlantans to be
seen and for anybody to make a deal,'' he said.
   By offering decision-makers a good time, businesses hope to gain
an edge when contract time comes around. Or by staging an event
where customers can rub elbows with the famous and powerful,
businesses hope to benefit from kind memories later on.
   On the more concrete side, the studies estimate convention
visitors, including about 15,000 members of the news media, will
spend:
   _Between $9.6 million and $10.5 million on hotel rooms.
   _Between $3.8 million and $4.3 million in hotel restaurants.
   _Between $4.9 million and $5.2 million in other restaurants.
   _Some $1.5 million in hospitality suites.
   _Between $1.9 million and $2.2 million on entertainment.
   _Between $3 million and $3.4 million in retail stores.
   _Between $2.3 million and $2.5 million on local transportation.
   _Between $1.1 million and $1.2 million on miscellaneous
purchases.
   All that adds up to a direct impact of $28.1 million, using a
study based on the 17,200 hotel rooms reserved for the convention,
or $30.8 million, based on 35,000 visitors.
   The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau says each convention
dollar spent in the city turns over 2.09 times in the local
economy, giving a total direct and indirect impact of $58.7 million
or $64.3 million.
   Mark Weiner Sr., who is in charge of policing use of the
convention logo, said there'll be the usual assortment of buttons,
T-shirts, coffee mugs, pens, pencils and other paraphernalia
available for folks who want to remember Atlanta.
   And there's the donkey call. ``It's on a string that you wear
around your neck and emulates the sounds of a donkey,'' Weiner said.

   There are three Main Streets in Atlanta, but none
is the main street.
   That is Peachtree Street, just plain Peachtree Street _ not
Peachtree Circle, Peachtree Court, Peachtree Drive, Peachtree Lane,
Peachtree Parkway, Peachtree Place, Peachtree Battle Avenue,
Peachtree Battle Circle, Peachtree Corners Circle, Peachtree Park
Drive, West Peachtree Street or any of the other almost 30 streets
named in some way after peach trees.
   Just plain Peachtree Street, the one without any peach trees.
   Just plain Peachtree Street, the one with ``P'tree Street'' on
the road signs because the full name won't fit.
   To be exactly honest, however, it's only just plain Peachtree
Street for 4.3 miles. Then it becomes Peachtree Road for 7.7 miles,
then it transforms into Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and fades
away into four counties, eight towns and one deer crossing miles
away in the northeast Georgia foothills.
   And to be precise, Peachtree Road and Peachtree Industrial
Boulevard run side-by-side, sort of, for 2.8 miles. Luckily, it's
not at the same place where West Peachtree Street runs parallel to
Peachtree Street for about about a mile.
   Confused? Welcome to Atlanta!
   A trip along Peachtree's length touches almost all parts of
Atlanta life.
   The street's southern tip rests underneath a rapid rail track. A
few blocks later, you're at Five Points, the foot of the downtown
business district.
   Next comes office towers rising on either side of the tree-lined
street as it curves its way to Midtown, the center of the city's
arts life.
   Out a ways, you reach Buckhead, long the city's most upscale
area, and then Lenox, a busy retail region.
   After that, the character begins to change from bustling to
bristling.
   There are apartment buildings, condominiums, car lots. Then the
road narrows from six to four to two lanes and the traffic lights
become sparser.
   Finally, 44.1 miles from its beginning, the road becomes plain
old McEven Road.
   As it winds through the city and suburbs, Peachtree crosses
other streets named for famous Georgians: Martin Luther King Jr.
Boulevard, Ralph McGill Boulevard, Jimmy Carter Boulevard.
   It also crosses Mitchell Street _ named for the man who donated
land for Atlanta's first railroad station, not Margaret Mitchell,
author of ``Gone With The Wind.'' She, by the way, was run over and
killed in 1949 by a cab while trying to cross, you guessed it,
Peachtree Street.

<HEAD>Atlanta Offers Course To Give Cab Drivers Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta's taxi industry, considered by some a
blight on the city's polished image of Southern hospitality, is
sending drivers to school to teach them how to be nice to all the
visitors expected for the Democratic National Convention.
   Organizers are aware that a cab and its driver are often the
first to greet visitors. And they want at least 1,000 of the city's
approximately 1,800 hacks to go to charm school by the time
delegates, reporters and party leaders begin arriving in mid-July.
   The goal of the Atlanta Ambassadors program is ``first to
sensitize the industry to the level of services that are expected
and then secondly ... to try and change the public's perception of
the industry,'' said Joseph Hall, a retired Army colonel who for
the past year has headed the city's Taxicabs and Vehicles for Hire
Bureau.
   Leslie Breland, director of central Atlanta marketing for the
city's convention bureau, admits Atlanta taxi drivers have had a
bad reputation in the past, ``mainly because the drivers have been
pretty much a hodgepodge of different companies without a sense of
cohesion and purpose.''
   The Ambassadors program is modeled on a similar effort in Miami
dubbed ``Miami Nice.'' The three-hour class, now required for all
cabbies who apply for or renew their licences, teaches courtesy and
professionalism, Atlanta history and rules and regulation of the
industry.
   One of the concepts the course teaches is for the drivers to
think of their cabs as their office.
   ``From the physical standpoint, the taxicabs are looking better
and cleaner,'' Ms. Breland said.
   She believes the program is having an impact already. A recent
computer trade show brought about 60,000 people to Atlanta and she
said the convention bureau has yet to receive a negative letter.
   ``Our comments from both the business community as well as the
visitors are that the cabs look clean, the drivers look clean and a
friendly smile goes a long way.
   ``From the driver's standpoint, those friendly smiles turn into
bigger tips for them,'' she said.

<HEAD>Power, Geography And Lady Luck Determine Where Democrats Stay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Power, geography and the luck of the draw will
decide where Democrats stay during their national convention this
month.
   VIPS, financial gurus and party brass automatically get the best
hotels, while state delegates and journalists divvy up about 18,000
rooms in 106 other hotels dotting a four-county area.
   Even private dwellings are getting into the act under a
``Host-a-Home'' program that will open up some of Atlanta's best
addresses to Democrats from across the country.
   But as the convention draws near, some lingering questions about
lodging remain.
   Convention spokeswoman Ruth Berry said housing plans won't be
finalized for another week, a situation that gives hotel managers
the fits, but she said flatly that everybody will get a room.
   Only the Georgia delegation, which plays host to the convention,
got to choose its hotel outright. Chairman John Henry Anderson
selected the Omni International, which is connected to both The
Omni arena and the Georgia World Congress Center, twin sites of the
convention.
   Last October, the Democratic Party's other state chairmen used
an unusual lottery to decide where their delegations will stay and
where they will sit during the nominating process _ courtesy of the
Atlanta Braves baseball team.
   The chairmen, meeting in Washington last October, picked
numbered baseballs out of a bin, each signed by major league home
run king Henry Aaron. No. 1 was chosen by Louisiana, and State
Chairman James J. Brady promptly selected the Atlanta Hilton.
   The state getting first choice for lodging got the last choice
for seating on the convention floor, said Ms. Berry.
   Maryland chose the final baseball and wound up in a Holiday Inn,
but its delegates will have front-row seats when the Democrats
nominate their presidential candidate.
   Two other delegations, from Minnesota and South Dakota, were
barred from the lottery because they violated party rules by
failing to adhere to the national party's deadline for primary
season events, Ms. Berry said. They ended up at some of the more
far-flung motels, a traffic-clogged 45 minutes away from the
convention site.
   While lodging ranges from the posh Hilton to chain hotels on
neon-lined strips in the Atlanta suburbs, the Democratic Party's
powers-that-be will put their feet up in either the Ritz-Carlton or
the Westin Peachtree Plaza.
   The party apparatus itself will operate out of the Marriott
Marquis and the Hyatt Regency, both downtown high-rises. That means
Democrats and their top financiers will take up the biggest part of
four of the city's best hotels, all of which were exempt from the
state-by-state lottery.
   And under the ``Host-a-Home'' campaign, devised by Jerry
Skelton, some delegates and reporters will be staying with owners
willing to open their doors.
   Roger and Dee Whitney, who own a $350,000 home in Cobb County
just northwest of Atlanta, said they joined the program not because
of politics _ they are Republicans _ but because they wanted to be
a part of one of the biggest events in recent Atlanta history.
   ``This convention is putting Atlanta in the spotlight, and we'd
like to think we had a small part in all the excitement,'' said
Mrs. Whitney.

   When southern corn leaf blight wiped out
15 percent of the U.S. corn crop in 1970 at a cost of more than $1
billion, plant breeders scrambled and within two years found
varieties resistant to the disease.
   Ironically, it was the breeders who had helped to start the
disaster.
   Aiming for better varieties, they had unknowingly bred
susceptibility to the blight into fully 80 percent of the nation's
corn crop. Without that genetic uniformity, the blight would have
done little damage.
   The same reliance on uniform crops led to the Irish potato
famine of the 1840s and to the spread of a wheat disease in 1916
that led Herbert Hoover to call for two wheatless days each week.
   The danger is that it could happen again.
   According to Peter Day, director of the Center for Agricultural
Molecular Biology at Rutgers University, too little is being done
to prevent such epidemics.
   ``What we're concerned about is having back-up ability to deal
with future threats,'' Day said during a recent U.S. Department of
Agriculture conference on ``Biotic Diversity and Germplasm
Preservation _ Global Imperatives.''
   ``Germplasm'' is the breeder's term for the hereditary
information in plants or animals. When breeders encounter a crisis
like the southern corn leaf blight, they search for
disease-resistance genes in domesticated and wild varieties of the
threatened crop.
   The United States has no naturally occurring wild varieties of
its major food crops. Tomatoes come from Central and South America,
wheat and barley from the Middle East and soybeans from Asia.
Virtually every major food crop is native to some other part of the
world.
   ``The U.S. is a have-not nation in terms of germplasm
resources,'' said Henry Shands, director of the National Plant
Germplasm System, operated by the USDA's Agricultural Research
Service. ``We've got to have a certain amount of gene bank defense
to protect our nation's food supply in the future.''
   Without those breeding resources, Shands said, ``the agriculture
systems are going to collapse. We just don't have enough land.''
   Collecting germplasm in foreign countries is often a politically
delicate task, complicated by what is usually called the
``north-south debate.'' This refers to the unwillingness of some
tropical and semi-tropical countries rich in germplasm (the south)
to export their resources to the industrialized nations (the north).
   Many of the tropical countries complain they are forced to pay
industrial nations a hefty price for seeds produced from the
tropical countries' own resources.
   Some have done more than complain. Ethiopia has largely cut off
access to its germplasm resources, for example. And many nations
that could help each other _ such as North Korea and South Korea _
refuse to exchange germplasm with one another because of the tense
political relations between them.
   The United States maintains germplasm collections around the
country, with a central repository, the National Seed Storage
Laboratory, in Fort Collins, Colo.
   But not enough is being done to evaluate and use those genetic
resources, researchers say. And the programs cover only plants. No
organized program exists to collect and store the germplasm of
important farm animals.
   Unfortunately, financial support for germplasm collection and
evaluation is lacking, Shands said. The National Plant Germplasm
System budget increased from almost $14 million in 1986 to $26.5
million this year, but despite USDA appeals, no increases were
proposed for next year.
   Additional funds are needed to speed the incorporation of
disease resistance into food crops, which reduces the need for
pesticides, improving food safety and water quality, Shands said.
   ``Whales receive enormous attention while seeds go unnoticed,''
said Lawrence Busch of the University of Kentucky. ``Some
absolutely minute and totally unattractive grass might be as
important as that whale.''
   For example, a tall wild wheat collected in Eastern Turkey in
1948 was found to carry genes that made domestic wheat resistant to
common and dwarf bunt and made it better able to tolerate stripe
rust, snow mold and mildew, said Sherl Dietz, coordinator of the
Agricultural Research Service's Western Regional Plant Introduction
Station in Pullman, Wash.
   The transfer of disease-resistance genes from wild strawberries
to commercial varieties has helped increase strawberry yields by
300 percent since 1960, said Dietz. Similar advances have been made
in other crops.
   Part of the urgency in conserving germplasm comes from the
escalating destruction of forests and other natural habitats around
the world.
   Up to 20,000 species of plants and animals become extinct each
year because of land clearing, urban development and overgrazing,
said Waldemar Klassen, director of the Agricultural Research Center
in Beltsville.
   ``The loss of unique plants and animals will deny future
generations the use of still undiscovered genes for new foods,
fibers and medicines and industrial raw materials,'' he said.
   With its limited resources, the Agricultural Research Service
does the best it can to collect germplasm before it is lost, Shands
said. A botanist will go to Pakistan soon, for example, to retrace
ancient trade routes in search of citrus fruits and other crops
that may have been planted by the traders who followed Marco Polo
to the Orient.
   It's possible crops that have been lost in Europe and the Middle
East might survive in those isolated regions. Farmers are rapidly
clearing the land there, and the opportunity to search for unusual
crops won't last long, he said.
   Storing germplasm is a tricky business. Although it's tempting
to think of plant gene banks as libraries from which breeders can
pluck genetic information they need, gene banks differ from
libraries in one important respect: the gene banks are alive.
   Plant germplasm is stored largely in the form of seeds. They
last a long time _ nobody is quite sure how long; 50 or 100 years
might be a good guess depending on the species _ but they don't
last forever.
   At the National Small Grain Collection in Beltsville, David
Smith oversees 108,000 specimens of grains including wheat, barley,
oats, rye, rice and triticale, a wheat-rye hybrid.
   Seeds are stored in small, manila envelopes, with a maximum of
500 grams of seed (about a pound) kept on hand for each sample. The
envelopes are stored in metal boxes stacked on tall,
industrial-style steel shelves in a room where the temperature is
kept at 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Breeders requesting samples are sent about 5 grams, enough to
grow a row about five feet long, Smith said. When stocks run low,
seeds are planted and grown to replenish the seed supply.
   That also provides an opportunity to further identify the
genetic traits contained in the seeds, but the process has a cost.
Some genes in the original batch appear again in the new
generation; some don't. ``Every time you regenerate seeds you lose
a little diversity,'' says Shands.
   Information on U.S. germplasm is kept in a database called the
Germplasm Resources Information Network, or GRIN, which is
available to any plant breeder.
   Such resources will be essential to feed a world that will
support 6 billion people by the year 2000. The world's farmers will
have to produce more food in one generation than has been produced
in the entire 10,000-year history of agriculture, said Garrison
Wilkes of the University of Massachusetts, and maintaining genetic
diversity will be a global imperative.
   ``There will be no synthetic food,'' Wilkes said. ``You can't
look for substitute technology.''

<HEAD>New Newsletter, ``Bookwatch,'' Finds Science Texts Botching Facts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Add inaccuracy to the multitude of sins critics
are attributing to science texts these days.
   Critics of science texts have lately accused publishers of
``dumbing down'' their books, of making them dull, and of pandering
to interest groups who oppose the teaching of evolution on
religious grounds.
   Above all, they charge, science texts with their predictable
experiments and boring vocabulary lists are at least partly to
blame for turning a fascinating subject into one students want to
avoid.
   Now it seems such texts may be guilty of botching elementary
scientific facts, according to ``Bookwatch,'' a first-of-its-kind,
no-holds-barred monthly newsletter devoted to reviewing junior high
and high school science texts.
   ``Bookwatch,'' was launched in February by William V. Mayer,
emeritus professor of biology of the University of Colorado, and
William J. Bennetta, a research associate and fellow of the
California Academy of Science.
   Each issue offers three 1,000-word reviews by practicing
scientists and science educators.
   Bennetta said he first became interested in science texts in
1985 when California education authorities drew national attention
by successfully demanding that publishers devote more space to
evolution.
   ``For the first time I looked into the kinds of textbooks being
submitted, and was severely disappinted by what I saw,'' he said.
   The newsletter, published by the National Center for Science
Education in Berkeley, Calif., claims to be to science texts what
``Consumer Reports'' is to retail products: a candid review free of
influence from publishers. It's aimed at teachers and state
officials responsible for selecting science texts.
   The reviews in the four editions published so far identified an
array of factual errors.
   The teacher's edition of ``Life Science 1987,'' a junior high
biology text published by Scott, Foresman and Co., states,
incorrectly, that the word ``biology'' derives from Latin roots
meaning the study of life. As reviewer Michael T. Ghiselin pointed
out, the word is rooted in Greek.
   Prentice-Hall's ``Biology 1987,'' inaccurately tells 10th
graders that electron microscopes were around in 1931 _ about 30
years before they were in use, according to reviewer Colin O.
Hermans, professor of biology at Sonoma State University.
   Lawrence W. Swan, a biology professor at San Francisco State
University, found that the teacher's edition of D.C. Heath and
Co.'s ``Life Science 1987'' text for middle-school students was
``loaded with errors.''
   The text shows a picture of a lemur, but wrongly calls it a
monkey. It presents a map incorrectly showing the range of the
American opossum extending to northernmost Alaska. The map ``also
shows both monotremes and marsupials in New Zealand, though New
Zealand has neither,'' according to the review.
   The authors of Scott, Foresman's text, ``Biology 1988,'' ``guess
that ...a fish has hipbones and a human-type pelvis'' and ``they
depict the hazardous dumping of chemical wastes as something `in
the past,''' write Mayer and Bennetta.
   Bennetta said he has not heard from publishers so far, but has
gotten numerous encouraging letters from education officials.
   But Kate Nyquist, vice president of science and health at Scott,
Foresman, said that while she has ``a great deal of respect'' for
the National Center for Science Education, ``Bookwatch is one of
their least productive enterprises.''
   ``I'm not saying we don't make any mistakes and we're always
grateful to have them pointed out. But to say as the newsletter did
that this book is `scientifically meaningless' is rather global,
and not correct.''
   She said her company takes the newsletter ``very seriously, but
it criticizes from a very narrow perspective. It can hurt my
business. But I don't think our customers recognize it as a
constructive evaluation tool.''
   Calls to Prentice-Hall and D.C. Heath were not returned.

<HEAD>Sleep Disruption Blamed For Mountain Climbers' Impaired Judgment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mountain climbers may suffer impaired
judgment because they don't sleep well, according to a study of six
people who simulated climbing Mount Everest by living 40 days in a
low-pressure chamber.
   ``People have known for a long time that sleep at high altitudes
is poor. We found sleep at high altitudes is so poor that little
restorative effect can be expected,'' Dr. James D. Anholm said in a
summary of his study.
   ``These new results call into question the long-held belief that
the dangers of high-altitude climbing are due primarily to the
dangers of terrain, weather and the lack of oxygen,'' Anholm said.
   Oxygen lack at night, instead of during the day's exertions,
probably is responsible for the severe sleep loss, said Anholm, an
assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Medical
Center in California.
   Climbers who carry oxygen at high altitudes would probably
benefit more from using it while they sleep than while they are
awake, he said.
   Jim Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to reach
the summit of Everest, the world's tallest mountain at more than
29,000 feet, was skeptical of the study but said it may have merit.
   ``It could be lack of sleep causes people to make mistakes at
high altitudes, but I think it's more the lack of oxygen'' during
exertion, he said by telephone from Port Townsend, Wash. ``I feel
that's a bigger cause. You don't sleep a lot, but you sleep
enough.''
   Phil Ershler, who in 1984 became the first American to climb
Everest's north face, said he sleeps well on mountains, but ``I
don't think there's any question that there's some validity'' to
Anholm's conclusions.
   How well a climber sleeps and performs at high altitude ``is
very much an individual thing,'' Ershler said by phone from
Bellevue, Wash.
   Anholm, an internist, presented his study in May at the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology annual
meeting here.
   The six people in Anholm's study were among eight paid
volunteers who lived for 40 days in a large low-pressure chamber in
Natick, Mass., as part of a larger Army-funded study of the effects
of high altitude.
   Pressures in the chamber were regularly reduced to simulate a
climb of Everest, with stops at sea level, 15,000 feet, 20,000 feet
and 26,410 feet, about the level of the South Col camp.
   Anholm measured oxygen in the volunteers' blood and monitored
their sleep by measuring brain waves.
   He found blood oxygen levels were lowest at high altitude and
during sleep, and that as altitude increased, the volunteers slept
much less, awakened more often, felt more irritable in the morning,
and had far more frequent episodes of sleep apnea, intervals during
which breathing ceased for about 10 seconds.
   Even at the simulated 15,000-foot level, the volunteers rarely
slept more than 10 minutes before awakening. Most significantly,
the number of arousals _ two- or three-second awakenings that
weren't remembered, as opposed to full awakenings that last more
than 10 seconds _ rose from 20 per hour at sea level to 117 per
hour at 26,410 feet.
   ``For sleep to have a restorative effect, it needs to be
relatively undisturbed,'' Anholm said. ``These very brief arousals
disturb sleep enough that you perform as though you are partially
sleep deprived.''

gotten numerous encouraging letters from education officials.
   Kate Nyquist, vice president of science and health at Scott,
Foresman, said, ``I'm not saying we don't make any mistakes and
we're always grateful to have them pointed out. But to say as the
newsletter did that this book is `scientifically meaningless' is
rather global, and not correct.''
   Calls to Prentice-Hall were not returned.

<HEAD>Sleep Disruption Blamed For Mountain Climbers' Impaired Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mountain climbers may suffer impaired
judgment because they don't sleep well, according to a study of six
people who simulated climbing Mount Everest by living 40 days in a
low-pressure chamber.
   ``People have known for a long time that sleep at high altitudes
is poor. We found sleep at high altitudes is so poor that little
restorative effect can be expected,'' Dr. James D. Anholm said in a
summary of his study.
   Oxygen lack at night, instead of during the day's exertions,
probably is responsible for the severe sleep loss, said Anholm, an
assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Medical
Center in California.
   The six people in Anholm's study lived for 40 days in a large
low-pressure chamber as part of a larger Army-funded study of the
effects of high altitude. Pressures were regularly reduced to
simulate a climb of Everest, with stops at sea level, 15,000 feet,
20,000 feet and 26,410 feet.
   Anholm found blood oxygen levels were lowest at high altitude
and during sleep, and that as altitude increased, the volunteers
slept much less, awakened more often, felt more irritable in the
morning, and had more frequent episodes of sleep apnea, intervals
during which breathing ceased for about 10 seconds.
   ``For sleep to have a restorative effect, it needs to be
relatively undisturbed,'' Anholm said. ``These very brief arousals
disturb sleep enough that you perform as though you are partially
sleep deprived.''

<HEAD>Silicone Gel Implants Hinder Detection Of Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early signs of breast cancer may be harder to
detect in women who have breasts enlarged with silicone-gel
implants, a study suggests.
   The California study included 753 breast cancer patients treated
during a 66-month period, 20 of whom had received the implants.
   Mammography, an X-ray method used to detect breast cancer, had
failed to detect the cancer in all 20, said the study by Dr. Melvin
J. Silverstein, of The Breast Center and Valley Hospital Medical
Center in Los Angeles' Van Nuys district.
   Silverstein and his colleagues said that when cancer finally was
detected in the women with implants, it was more likely to be at an
advanced stage and to have spread to lymph nodes, ``resulting in
worsened prognosis.''
   The study was printed in the June issue of Archives of Surgery,
a journal published by the American Medical Association.
   Doctors consider early detection of breast cancer, by
self-examination and mammography, essential because women are more
likely to survive and avoid disfiguring surgery if the tumors are
found at an early stage.
   More than 1 million American women have received implants to
enlarge their breasts. Silverstein said doctors should tell women
considering such implants that the cosmetic surgery may delay
diagnosis of breast cancer.
   Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., a Washington physician, agreed in an
accompanying editorial, but said proper placement of silicone
implants may reduce the extent to which the implants cloud details
of a mammogram.

<HEAD>Doctors Warn Against Leaving Babies On Waterbeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents should not leave babies face down on water
beds, because they may not be able to raise their heads enough to
breathe.
   ``We believe that a general warning should be issued and that
infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water
beds,'' wrote Dr. Ramesh Ramanathan and colleagues from the
University of Wisconsin.
   They raised their concern in a recent letter in the New England
Journal of Medicine after reviewing 34 cases of sudden infant death
in Wisconsin. Six of the babies were found dead on water beds.
   ``We believe that an infant placed on a water bed with quilts or
restrictive clothing (one of our patients was clad in a snowsuit)
forms a depression or sink in the water bed, in which the head and
face lie,'' they wrote. ``It is very likely that the infant is
unable to lift its head up from such a position in order to breathe
sufficiently.''

<HEAD>Shoplifting in Late Life May Signal Psychiatric Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A person who begins shoplifting late in life may
have a psychiatric problem that requires professional evaluation,
researchers say.
   First-offense shoplifting by people older than 60 has been
increasing for more than a decade, Gary Moak of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School and co-authors write in the June issue
of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.
   Sociological data doesn't support the idea that economic
hardship is to blame, they said. But among psychiatric
explanations, ``patients' inability to reconcile the loss of a
spouse or of their health, job, home or independence may lead to
unconscious acting out to obtain symbolic compensation, especially
if the patient feels unfairly deprived of the loss.''

   Plan ahead.
   That's the free advice college finance experts from the College
Board on down are dispensing these days to parents baffled about
how to pay the mounting costs of four years of college.
   Such free advice, unfortunately, is worth every cent considering
the uncertainties over the future course of tuition and what
parents and youngsters can do to plan for it.
   How worried is the public about tuition?
   A survey released in June by the American Home Economics
Association found that paying for college tied AIDS as the biggest
worries of U.S. teens.
   The average annual cost of attending a four-year public college
in 1987-88 was $5,604, according to the College Board. At four-year
private schools, the average was $10,199. College costs at all
institutions went up 6.9 percent this past year as consumer prices
rose less than 2 percent.
   Making matters worse, government and private student aid is
down. In 1987, such aid totaled $20.5 billion, down 6 percent from
1980 levels when adjusted for inflation.
   For starters, then, it's asking a lot of parents to plan and
save for a commodity when experts can't agree on how rapidly it is
going up in price.
   Consider:
   During the 1980s, average tuitions climbed nearly 10 percent a
year in the 1980s, double the rate of inflation and 50 percent
faster than personal incomes, according to a recent report by the
American Council on Education in Washington.
   But go back 10 years, to the 1970s, and that same report finds
tuition has gone up at a slower pace than medical care, energy
costs and the price of new homes.
   So the great unsolved questions are: Were the double-digit
increases of the 1980s a fluke, or the new norm? And if colleges
persist in raising their costs at break-neck speed, where can
parents find savings vehicles that can keep up?
   Possible solutions being considered by states, the federal
government, and colleges themselves, are so-called tuition
prepayment and saving plans. But even these are mired in
uncertainty.
   In June, the Reagan administration sent a measure called the
College Savings Bond Act of 1988 to Congress that would grant
families with adjusted gross incomes under $60,000 tax-free
interest on savings bonds used to pay for college.
   The tax benefit would be reduced for families earning between
$60,000 and $80,000, and eliminated entirely for households with
incomes above $80,000.
   If approved, the bonds would be available beginning Jan. 1.
   On the college side, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh pioneered
a plan three years ago allowing alumni parents to pay a lump sum _
the amount depending on the age of the child _ that would guarantee
four years of college assuming the child was accepted for admission.
   But Duquesne suspended its program in March because of
higher-than-expected tuition increases and lower-than-anticipated
earnings on investments that rendered its tuition plan
uneconomical. Similar programs at the University of Detroit and
Canisius College in Buffalo, N.Y., are likewise at a standstill and
not taking new applicants.
   State-sponsored programs, meanwhile, have gotten off to a slow
start because of their uncertain tax status. In March, the Internal
Revenue Service cleared the way for Michigan's program allowing
parents to participate in a prepaid-tuition plan and not pay
additional federal taxes.
   Michigan and Florida plan to go ahead with their programs this
year, joining Wyoming which already has a successful prepayment
plan in operation.
   Richard Cole, president of the Michigan Education Trust, said
his state hopes to start offering contracts to parents toward the
end of July, giving anyone the opportunity to purchase the
equivalent of four years of a public college education for any
Michigan child.
   The cost of a contract for a newborn child will be about $6,500
for four years of college, and half that for two years, Cole said.
   ``The enthusiasm far exceeds anything we ever expected. I think
several thousand will sign up immediately,'' said Cole.
   But the IRS ruling apparently made such plans less attractive to
other states because it made state trusts themselves subject to
taxation.
   Tennessee has dropped plans to establish a tuition prepayment
program that was to have taken effect July 1, according to Ron
Gambill, executive director of the Tennessee Student Assistance
Corp.
   Instead, Tennessee is joining a growing number of states such as
Illinois that are offering parents college savings bonds.
   Whether parents decide to put money aside through an organized
plan, or simply save on their own, the one certainty in the
uncertain tuition picture is that most families with some kind of
savings plan will be in better shape than those who save nothing in
the mistaken belief that colleges will bail them out.

<TEXT>
   To help parents sort out some of the confusion of paying college
tuition, the College Board recently compiled a list of questions
consumers should ask to help them decide if college prepayment or
savings plans fill their needs.
   Among them:
   _ Does the plan require a minimum contribution to enter?
   _ Can anyone in the family contribute to the plan, or are there
exclusions?
   _ Can proceeds from the plan be transferred to other members of
the family if the named beneficiary's educational plans change?
   _ Are benefits restricted to colleges in a given state, or to a
particular class of colleges, such as privates?
   _ How does the plan guarantee its benefits?
   _ Does the plan cover all costs, or just tuition?
   _ Does the plan have residency requirements?
   _ What are the refund conditions in case a student isn't
admitted to college, or dies, or becomes disabled?

<TEXT>
   Bronwen E. Latimer, a 24-year-old New Yorker who
will be entering the Columbia University School of Journalism in
the fall, is studying French at the Sorbonne in Paris this summer.
   Elizabeth Cohen, 18, of Austin, Texas, two summers ago spent six
weeks in Salamanca, Spain, studying Spanish language and culture.
Now entering her sophomore year at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., she plans to spend her junior year in Rome or Florence
studying art.
   They are among tens of thousands of American students reversing
a recent trend and going to foreign countries to study. According
to the Institute of International Education (IIE), the nation's
largest education exchange agency, 48,483 students earned academic
credit for studies outside the United States in 1985-86, up from
27,145 in 1982-83 _ nearly double the number in three years.
   The study offered no explanation for the increase. But
administrators of study-abroad programs said that at least some
students may be finding that study overseas is economical compared
with the more expensive U.S. schools where tuitions have been
soaring throughout the 1980s.
   Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., is noted for study-abroad
programs in which students from 225 U.S. colleges participate. The
school is sending more than 1,700 students from U.S. campuses to
study in the British Isles and Vienna this year, said college
President Bette Landman, compared with 750 students in 1980-81.
   Landman says she believes the increase stems from ``an
increasing sensitivity among students to foreign study, not only to
help their careers, but especially in the last year or two, to the
kinds of understandings we as world citizens must bring to our
lives.''
   At Northern Illinois University, where the number of students in
overseas programs has risen at least 10 percent in that period,
Orville Jones, assistant dean of international programs, says that
since more students have traveled during their high school years,
the thought of studying overseas is no longer as strange or
frightening.
   The IIE survey, which does not include American students earning
credits toward degrees in foreign institutions, found that 76.8
percent of U.S. students abroad were studying in Western Europe.
   The most popular country, Great Britain, attracted 29.3 percent
of all students studying abroad, followed by France with 13.7
percent, Spain with 8.8 percent, Italy 7.8 percent, and West
Germany 6.1 percent.
   Latin America attracted 7 percent, with smaller percentages
studying in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa.
   ``I would hope that as the growth continues, American students
will go to developing countries in Africa and Latin American
countries,'' said Richard Kranos, IIE president.
   Nearly 90 percent of the students were in programs sponsored by
U.S. colleges and universities, the survey found. The most popular
field of study was liberal arts, with 18.2 percent, followed by
foreign language with 16.7 percent.
   Almost two-thirds, or 63.8 percent, of U.S. students abroad were
female, according to the report.
   The survey was conducted by mail last year with 2,896 accredited
U.S. colleges and universities, of which 1,898 reported students
earning academic credit for study abroad.
   The American Institute for Foreign Study says it will send about
37,000 students, 24,000 of whom are high school students, abroad
this year.
   ``They are realizing that it will improve their chances of
getting into the college of their choice and it is something
special on their resume when they go to look for their first job to
be able to say they spent some time abroad studying,'' says Henry
Kahn, president of the Greenwich, Conn.,-based institute.
   ``Every morning when you open the newspaper, the headlines are
from other parts of the world. If young people are going to be able
to understand and relate to our interdependent, global society,
they have to study in other countries. This will enable them to
learn their languages, their cultures and their unique feelings
about the United States.
   ``This study-abroad experience provides both personal growth and
educational enrichment.''
   Elizabeth Cohen echoes the thought: ``It's a great thing to be
able to say, `I studied at the University of Salamanca,' because it
is a famous university,'' she said.
   ``I would not trade that experience for anything in the world.
It was the greatest summer of my life. I met some of the greatest
people I've ever met.''
   Julia Logan, 21, a 1988 graduate of Yale University with a
degree in biology, had visited the Soviet Union twice while
studying Russian at Yale.
   ``I think it can only help for Americans to visit the Soviet
Union and for the Soviets to visit here.
   ``I remember a Russian proverb that goes something like, `It is
better to see once than to hear a hundred times,''' she said.

   Is this the end of ``Most Likely to Succeed''?
   Are there to be no more photo listings of ``Most Popular'' and
``Best Looking'' in the class?
   Well, not exactly, but there is a new rival zooming in on the
traditional printed school graduation album _ the video yearbook.
   With producers pitching video versions of everything from
weddings to wills, the high school or college yearbook apparently
is also an alluring subject for memorabilia in motion.
   Unlike the traditional yearbook, which may go to print midway
through the school year, the video yearbook can include end-of-year
occasions like the senior prom and graduation. In most cases, it
doesn't replace the traditional album, but is in addition to it.
   The Gruenberg Video Group (GVG), based in Philadelphia, started
VideOvation about two years ago and has some 30 schools to date
involved in the curriculum-based project in which the students do
their own camerawork to record the year in school.
   With guidance throughout the year from VideOvation staff, the
students learn about videomaking and storytelling and wind up with
a 30-minute video that they can sell to other students, parents and
others in the community.
   The company edits and produces all the student-shot footage and
puts in about three minutes of generic, transitional video,
including music, titles and news montages.
   It costs the school about $7,500, which it can make back on
sales. Most schools charge about $30 or $40 for the half-hour video.
   ``The key here,'' says Kathryn Kleibacker, GVG vice president,
marketing, ``is that teachers receive a full curriculum and
guidance on the production of their yearbook. Kids are really
learning about visual literacy as well as video production.''
   Field producers employed by GVG supervise the production by
meeting with student teams on a weekly basis.
   ``What's different about VideOvation in terms of other yearbooks
is that the curriculum is provided, as well as expert guidance and
editing,'' says Miss Kleibacker. ``With the advent of desktop
publishing in the computer world, and other visual mediums such as
MTV, visual literary skills are going to be an important part of
education in the future.''
   Yearbook Enterprises, based in Durham. N.C., works with about 50
colleges and high schools in teaching students how to use video
equipment and buying the rights to songs that young filmmakers want
to use as background music.
   ``It's educational,'' says company president Bob Levitan, who
filmed Duke University's yearbook for two years before graduating
in 1983. And, he says, ``it brings those black and white photos to
life by capturing the excitement and emotion that a print yearbook
can't always do.''
   Steve Sullivan, head of Dallas-based Video Yearbook Inc., says
the job brings smiles in addition to profits.
   ``I've been doing some of the shooting myself,'' Sullivan says.
``The excitement _ you forget about it once you get out of high
school. This is one way to keep it forever.''

   School bells can do a lot more than clang the
clarion call to class, according to an upstate New York teacher who
is also an avid bell collector.
   ``We learned to count by counting bells,'' says Amelia
Carpenter, who teaches first grade at the Chestnut Hill Elementary
School in Liverpool, N.Y.
   ``We also learned to add and subtract a bell, or bells. We could
compare sizes: which is larger? which is smaller?''
   She used bells to teach geography. ``I would show them a bell
from India. We would talk about the country and find it on the map
on the wall.''
   And science. ``What makes it ring? What is it made of _ brass,
wood?''
   There is a preponderance of teachers among bell buffs, says
Terry Mayer, head of the metropolitan New York chapter of the
American Bell Association and a designer of bell jewelry.
   ``It begins,'' she says, ``with the bell on the teacher's desk,
commanding attention, and the school bell signaling the beginning
and changes of class and recess.
   ``Then there are the summer trips teachers make. Somehow,
wherever they go, they are drawn to bells.
   ``Bells are a potent force in the world of the teacher. They add
a spell of enchantment to reading, writing and 'rithmetic. And they
are always a source of comfort and cheer in the after-school days
and years.''

<TEXT>
   Five years after a group of sages fired a
rocket called ``A Nation At Risk'' across America's schools, some
prominent educators believe little progress has been made so far in
rolling back the tide of mediocrity.
   But another school of opinion argues that the trend indicators _
from real wage growth for teachers to burgeoning high school
enrollments in advanced placement classes _ are pointing up and
foretell brighter days ahead.
   There is no gainsaying one fact: America's schools are still
riding a wave of reform and renewed public interest unprecedented
since the Soviets' 1957 launch of Sputnik forced political and
educational leaders to do some prolonged soul-searching about U.S.
schools.
   Those who look at the school reform movement and see a glass at
best half-empty include Secretary of Education William J. Bennett
and his predecessor, T.H. Bell; Ernest L. Boyer, president of the
influential Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching,
and the presidents of both major teacher unions, Mary Hatwood
Futrell and Albert Shanker.
   The most vigorous proponent of the argument that school reform
is already paying sizeable dividends is Bill Honig, California's
superintendent of public instruction, who has played a central role
in efforts to toughen school curriculums and create a new, national
certification board for teachers.
   ``A Nation At Risk'' was issued in April 1983 by an 18-member
National Commission on Excellence in Education, instructed to find
out why scores on exams such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test
plummeted from 1963 through 1980.
   Bell, the Reagan administration's first secretary of education
who personally appointed the commission and who left Washington at
the end of Reagan's first term, writes in his memoirs, ``The
Thirteenth Man,'' that Reagan missed a chance to spark a real,
widespread educational revival.
   Bell, now at the University of Utah, contends that school
reforms such as stricter high school graduation requirements
imposed by most states have made things better for perhaps
two-thirds of American youth.
   But Bell contends reforms ``didn't do a darn thing'' to solve
the dropout problem or close the performance gap between affluent
students and the disadvantaged, many of them minorities. ``We're
losing 30 percent to 40 percent of the rising generation,'' says
Bell.
   Boyer's Carnegie Foundation warns that the reform movement ``has
largely bypassed our most deeply troubled schools'' in the inner
cities. The Committee on Economic Development, a policy research
group of business executives and academic leaders, came to a
similar conclusion.
   NEA President Futrell says the Carnegie and CED reports support
what the NEA was saying five years ago: that tougher standards
won't work without a major infusion of resources for the schools.
   ``We feel vindicated,'' said Futrell, who recently proposed
establishing at least one experimental ``lighthouse'' district in
all 50 states where ``anything goes'' in the name of school reform.
   Albert Shanker, president of the 665,000-member American
Federation of Teachers, supports a myriad of radical school reforms
in hundreds or even thousands of districts.
   Shanker is convinced that the passive structure of public
schools _ with a teacher standing before a class spending most of
the time lecturing _ is not working for 80 percent of all students,
not just the poor, but most of the middle class as well.
   He bases his case largely on the results of the
government-sponsored National Assessment of Educational Progress _
tests given to a cross-section of students that show only 20
percent of the 17-year-olds left in school can write a coherent
letter, and only 6 percent can solve the type of algebraic problems
taught in junior high.
   Shanker believes the only way to get markedly better results is
to radically reorganize schools, allowing teachers to work in teams
under the guidance of lead teachers, who would spend their days
consulting, preparing lessons and coaching individual students, who
would themselves work in small groups and learn the rote lessons
from computers, videotapes and other high tech tools. Students
would be freed to move ahead at their own pace.
   Bennett contends that traditional schools are far more effective
for disadvantaged students than Shanker gives them credit for.
Bennett argues that it is the poor who need most a rigorous,
classic curriculum.
   In a report, ``American Education: Making It Work,'' unveiled at
the White House on the fifth anniversary of ``A Nation At Risk,''
Bennett concluded:``American education has made some undeniable
progress in the last few years. The precipitous downward slide of
previous decades has been arrested, and we have begun the long
climb back to reasonable standards. Our students have made modest
gains in achievement. They are taking more classes in basic
subjects. ... ''
   ``But we are certainly not doing well enough, and we are not
doing well enough fast enough. We are still at risk. ...''
   California's Honig voiced a sharp dissent, citing the facts that
thousands of more students in his state now are taking three years
of math and science, and 41,000 earned college credit on advanced
placement exams last year, up 73 percent from 1984.
   ``I'm not saying we're anywhere near where we have to be, but
we're on the right track,'' said Honig. Reform ``has worked for
many kids in inner cities.''

   America's young schoolchildren remain illiterates when it comes
to using computers, a national survey indicates, but many college
students consider the computer an important tool in career planning.
   A recent study of some 24,000 pupils in the third, seventh and
11th grades found that _ despite the so-called ``classroom computer
revolution'' _ access to computers is too limited at school and at
home, schools have failed to use computers effectively, and
teachers are trained inadequately.
   ``Although some schools offer excellent computer curricula,''
the survey concluded, ``many other schools apparently do not
provide effective instruction, at least in computer applications
and programming, to a large proportion of pupils.''
   Titled ``Computer Competence: The First National Assessment,''
the study was undertaken by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP), a project established 19 years ago by Congress to
conduct national surveys of various educational skills.
   It suggests that schools have only dented the ignorance most
students and teachers have of computers despite the huge purchases
by many schools during the 1980s.
   In 1980, 15 percent of elementary schools and 50 percent of high
schools offered computer instruction. By 1985, 82 percent of
elementary schools and 93 percent of secondary schools did so.
   Even so, more than eight of 10 seventh- and 11th-graders said
they never used computers to make a data base, slightly more than
half said they never used them to write letters, stories or
reports, and roughly three-quarters said they never used them to
make graphs.
   Except for word processing, students generally scored poorly on
questions dealing with computer applications _ making graphics or
working with data bases, for example _ because students said they
hardly ever got a chance to practice.
   Despite their poor showing, 91.2 percent of third graders and 86
percent of seventh graders said they liked using computers, and
more than half said they wished they used them more.
   Marc Tucker, president of the Washington-based National Center
on Education and the Economy, called the survey results
disappointing.
   ``The difference is between knowing a little about the computer,
and being able to use it effectively. Few American schoolchildren
can do the latter,'' he said.
   Ironically, while the NAEP study indicates the nation's young
students remain computer illiterates, in a recent survey at three
New England colleges the use of the computer was ranked along with
self-assessment and networking as among the most important skills
to have while looking for a job.
   The poll of more than 250 students and graduates at the
University of Rhode Island, and at Smith College and Babson College
in Massachusetts was reported by New York-based Drake Beam Morin,
Inc., a career counseling firm.
   One-third of those polled owned their own computers and more
than one-half said they had access to one. Thirteen percent said
they would use a computer as a tool to enable them to simplify and
organize their job search.
   As for those parents whose school-age children may be among the
computer illiterates but who cannot afford a home computer,
industry consultants suggest several solutions.
   ``Youth groups like the Girl Scouts have added a technology
badge to their program, some libraries are making personal
computers available to patrons, user groups abound for the major
hardware systems, and there's always the school computer lab,''
suggests Mindscape, Inc., of Northbrook, Ill., an educational
software publisher.
   The company says that with an average of only 15 minutes per day
being spent at the classroom keyboard, extra time at the home
computer will strengthen a child's skills.
   ``So coach them with the computer and inspire them to succeed,''
it advises parents. ``You are your child's first and most
influential teacher. Be a learning advocate at home, and watch your
children progress at school and later in life.''

   Fundamental changes in the educational system
are needed to attract students to technical fields and assure that
the nation has enough qualified scientists and engineers, according
to a recent study by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment.
   The OTA, a research arm of Congress, found that though American
schools have the capacity to produce the scientists and engineers
needed by the nation, many capable students never enter the fields
because of a lack of money or preparation.
   Some experts, the OTA report said, worry that a decline in
college-age students in the early 1990s and a lessened interest in
the technical fields will cause a decline in the number of
scientists and engineers.
   Despite these trends, said the report, ``shortages of scientists
and engineers are not inevitable.''
   Some adjustments will be made in the labor market, the report
said, causing more students to go into science and engineering, but
``the federal government may need to play a more active role.''
   The problem, the report said, could be attacked in two ways.
   To correct short-term shortages, the government could encourage
students to finish undergraduate and advanced degrees.
   ``If the nation wants more scientists and engineers relatively
quickly, then retaining college and graduate students in science
and engineering is the most useful policy strategy,'' the report
said. It noted that currently only about 30 percent of graduates
with bachelor's degrees enter full-time graduate level studies, and
only about half of doctoral candidates actually earn the doctoral
degree.
   ``Those who leave unwillingly or prematurely are a rich resource
that could be tapped,'' the report said.
   A longer-term solution is to expand and improve the talent pool
of students willing and prepared to go into the science fields.
   ``The years to do this are elementary school through the first
years of college,'' the report said. Increased recruitment into the
technical fields ``might come through full-scale revision of
elementary and secondary curricula, tracking, testing and course
structure,'' the report said, though it noted that such a change
``will be hard to achieve given the scale of American education and
the inertia of the existing system.''
   Another study found that students in most other countries are
far better educated in science than are American students.
   In a report released by the National Science Foundation, U.S.
students at three different grade levels all scored well behind
those from most other nations.
   ``For a technologically advanced country, it would appear that
(in the United States) a re-examination of how science is presented
and studied is required,'' said the study, which was conducted by
the International Association for Evaluation of Educational
Achievement, an association of research centers.
   The study was conducted by the International Association for
Evaluation of Educational Achievement, an association of research
centers. Early findings, which compared the United States only with
Japan and England, and with partial findings from Israel and
Sweden, were reported by The Associated Press in September.
   The comparative study was based on tests administered to 204,308
students at 7,581 schools in 24 countries between 1983 and 1986.
The tests were given at three academic levels: near the end of
primary grades, at about age 10; at grades eight and nine, about
age 14; and in the final year of high school.
   Among 10-year-olds, students in Japan, Korea and Finland scored
around 15.4 out of 24 possible correct answers. U.S. students
scored just below the middle of the scale at 13.2.
   Among 14-year-olds, Hungary, Japan and the Netherlands scored at
the top, while Americans ranked third from last with a mean score
of 16.5 out of 30 possible correct answers. The lowest-scoring
quarter of this age group, the report said, ``were scientifically
illiterate'' with their test scores ``at chance level.''
   Tests for the high school seniors were given only to those
specializing in science subjects. Hong Kong, England and Singapore
scored highest, with the United States students receiving among the
lowest marks.

   Bubble skirts are ``out'' and miniskirts are ``in'' for college
coeds this fall _ but blue jeans will retain their popularity on
the campus for both sexes, according to a national survey at 25
colleges and universities.
   Students taking part in the Roper Organization poll included on
their fashion ``out'' list such items as cut-off shorts, plaid
clothing, cowboy boots, floral print blouses,``granny'' boots, and
cropped shirts.
   The survey, sponsored by Levi Strauss & Co., was based on
interviews of 1,000 college students asked to predict what clothing
and accessories will be fashionable on campus this fall.
   Included on the students' fashion ``in'' list were T-shirts,
high top athletic shoes, sweat pants, oversized denim jackets,
pleated trousers and oxford shirts.
   Top accessory choices included sunglasses, leather belts,
backpacks and sport watches. Backpacks were selected by 51 percent
of the freshmen but got only 35 percent of the senior vote.
   Leather boots appealed to 56 percent of the women but only 17
percent of the men. Penny loafers were popular with 45 percent of
the men and 23 percent of the women in the poll.
   Also heavily favored by coeds were headbands or hair
accessories, and hoop earrings.
   Stonewashed jeans were the most popular style of blue jeans,
followed in order by old and faded jeans, acid-washed jeans, ``torn
with holes'' jeans and bleached jeans. Men said they wore jeans 60
percent of the time, while women wear them 47 percent of the time.
   Called the Levi's 501 Report, the survey has been conducted
annually since 1985.

   The number of part-time college students in the
average freshman class has increased 7.3 percent during the 1980s,
but total freshman enrollment has declined by a similar amount, a
survey shows.
   The major exception to that trend: private, doctoral
degree-granting universities, where average part-time rolls plunged
32.1 percent while freshman enrollments have risen 4 percent.
   An annual report from the College Board, ``Summary Statistics:
Annual Survey of Colleges, 1987-88,'' included average enrollment
data on 3,134 institutions of higher education.
   The survey shows that from 1980 to 1986:
   _ The average freshman class at all kinds of institutions was
down 7.4 percent, 942 students to 872. Two-year public technical
colleges experienced the biggest declines, 19.8 percent on average,
964 students to 773.
   _ The average institution had 1,489 part-time students in 1986,
7.3 percent more than the 1,388-student average in 1980. Leading
the way were two-year public technical colleges, where average
part-time rolls were up 24.7 percent, from 1,047 to 1,306.
   _ Full-time freshman rolls shrank 2.4 percent at all
institutions, and the biggest drop was at two-year technical
schools, where the average freshman class shrank by 11.9 percent,
from 1,264 to 1,114.
   _ Minority freshman rolls at four-year private universities rose
1.5 percent _ the biggest increase of any kind of institution.
Overall, minority enrollments rose from 15.4 percent to 15.8
percent of freshman attending all institutions.
   _ The average number of applications to freshman classes at all
four-year institutions increased 6.3 percent. The biggest average
gains were 11.5 percent at public doctoral granting universities,
and 10.5 percent at private liberal arts colleges.
   The sharp gain in part-timers results at least partly from
aggressive marketing by colleges to attract older students, said
College Board spokeswoman Janice Gams.
   Those increases have softened the impact of enrollment declines
in the number of 18-year-olds. That trend is not expected to
reverse itself until the mid-1990s, she said.
   The College Board is a non-profit educational association whose
members include more than 2,500 secondary and higher education
institutions.

   American universities have awarded more
doctorates in education than in any other field over the past two
decades, a government study says.
   ``Education has been the most popular field of choice for
doctoral study since 1966,'' said the report by the Department of
Education's Center for Statistics.
   The report, based on federal surveys, said that in 1966,
education held a narrow lead over the physical sciences as the most
popular field of doctoral-level study. Of the 18,239 doctorates
awarded by U.S. universities that year, 3,063, or 17 percent, were
in education, compared to 3,045 in the physical sciences.
   In 1986, education was still in the No. 1 spot, but by a much
wider margin. It accounted for 7,110, or 21 percent, of the 33,653
Ph.D.s awarded. The physical sciences again were second with 3,551.
   But education's share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7,960 and
has declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanced
degree. Men outnumbered women 4-to-1 among the education Ph.D.s in
1966. Women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the men in 1986,
3,795 to 3,315.
   The report, ``Profile of Education Doctorates: 1976 to 1986,''
was written by the center's Susan T. Hill, P. Elaine Kroe and
Summer D. Whitener.
   Education administration and supervision was the most popular
specialty, accounting for 1,622 of the Ph.D.s in 1986. Some 787
were in curriculum and instruction, 609 in higher education, 323 in
educational psychology and 315 in counseling and personnel services.
   A total of 1,141 of the Ph.D.s were in various subjects or
teaching fields, with physical education, health and recreation the
most popular (291), followed by reading education (134), music
education (94), trade and industrial education (86) and English
education (79).

   Going back to school is a tough adjustment time for most
children, but for stutterers, it may be particularly difficult.
   ``Children who stutter have a very natural fear of being `found
out,''' says Dr. Dean Williams, a speech-language pathologist at
the University of Iowa. ``They may be afraid to speak out in class
for fear of being laughed at. Or, they may be frightened of meeting
and speaking with other children during free periods. They are even
afraid of their teacher finding out they stutter.''
   And, because they often withdraw, teachers and other students
sometimes see them as less intelligent.
   ``This is simply not true,'' says Williams. ``It's one of the
myths which surround stuttering. Children who stutter are every bit
as bright and intelligent as their counterparts who do not
stutter.''
   The Speech Foundation of America, a non-profit Memphis, Tenn.,
organization set up to help stutterers, advises parents to take
special time with their children at the beginning of the school
year to discuss their fears or problems.
   ``Don't put off a child's fears as groundless or ridiculous,''
Williams says. ``Take them seriously and talk about them.''
   He says parents should also talk with school administrators and
teachers and encourage the child's instructors to call on him as
they would any child. ``Tell teachers not to rush or hurry the
child, and most importantly, to listen. Let the child know that
what he has to say is important and that there is no need to fear.''

   Educators today put too much emphasis on higher achievement
scores and not enough on developing students' ``inner resources,''
says a University of Rochester motivational psychologist.
   ``When we judge achievement only in terms of outcomes of
standardized tests, we create a classroom climate that is
profoundly alienating to both teachers and children,'' says Richard
Ryan, who has been studying elementary school-age children, their
parents and their teachers for some 10 years.
   Instead, he says, ``the emphasis should be on developing inner
resources. If children develop a sense of competence, of confidence
in approaching problems, and if they learn to enjoy challenges,
then they'll go on educating themselves even after their formal
school ends.''
   ``If kids can't write good sentences,'' Ryan says, ``or they
don't know where to find Iran on the globe, we should ask why kids
aren't internalizing instruction. We should ask, how can we help
kids to take an interest in this material _ not how we can force it
into them.''
   He compares what he calls a ``controlling'' style of teaching _
using social controls, such as rewards and punishments, to get
students to perform in certain ways _ to an ``autonomy-oriented''
style.
   The ``autonomy-oriented'' teachers give assignments that are
more open-ended, leaving room for a student to exercise individual
choice.
   In his evaluations at the Rochester, N.Y., school, Ryan says he
found that students in the ``controlling'' classrooms showed less
inner drive to learn, ``they didn't feel as competent and they had
less self-confidence that the students in the `autonomy-oriented'
classrooms.''
   And, while they did about as well on tests, ``students in the
`controlling' classrooms didn't seem to grasp conceptual ideas as
well.''
   A Cornell University professor believes this over-emphasis on
school achievement begins with kindergarten.
   But, kindergarten classes should put more emphasis on fun and
less on learning, says Irving Lazar, a professor of human service
studies at the Ithaca, N.Y., school. Class effectiveness should be
judged by the number of ``smiles per hour,'' he says.
   ``All we should ask of our kindergarten is that the children be
happy,'' says Lazar. ``We're pushing kids too hard too soon, and
they're getting turned off to the whole process of schooling. ..
....
   ``Most children love to learn. Instead of making it so
structured, we should get out of their way.
   ``Five-year-olds should be exposed to music and science. Read to
them, let them see you reading. But if the kid doesn't like a
story, put the book away and get another one. Don't turn reading
into a chore.''

   Parents should be careful not to ``overprogram''
their children with after-school activities, advises Dr. Richard
Oberfield, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NYU
Medical Center.
   ``On top of traditional worries about grades,'' he says, ``more
parents are insisting that their children become skilled in other
areas as well, from music to sports to art, as a way of coping with
an increasingly competitive environment.''
   Instead, he says, parents should leave time to do ``absolutely
nothing,'' if that is what the child wants.
   ``Time to play and to relax is important,'' he says. ``Without
constant pressure to succeed, eventually a child may even hook into
genuine interests.''
   Parents and children should spend that unstructured time
together, he adds.
   ``This gives them the feeling of being cared about for
themselves,'' he says, ``not just for their performance, which is
integral to their self-esteem.''

   The average public school teacher now earns
$28,031, up 5.6 percent over last year, reports the National
Education Association.
   Average salaries ranged from a high of $40,424 in Alaska to a
low of $19,750 in South Dakota.
   Ten states, including Alaska, now pay teachers more than $30,000
on average. South Dakota is the only state where teachers earn less
than $20,000 on average.
   The typical classroom teacher has more than 15 years'
experience, according to past surveys by the union.
   The national salary figure is up by $1,477 over the average of
$26,534 during the 1986-87 school year, union researchers said.
   The union did not estimate how much salaries will rise this
fall, but if teachers get another 5.6 percent salary increase, they
will be earning $29,600 on average for the 1988-89 school year.
   The $28,031 figure is an estimate based on salary data compiled
from all 50 states. The NEA figure is widely cited, including by
the U.S. Department of Education, as the most accurate indicator of
how much the nation's nearly 2.3 million classroom teachers in the
public schools are earning.

   Students shopping for a college should direct their own search
but many parents make the mistake of pushing their children to the
``right'' school _ right for the parents, but wrong for the child.
   So says a college guide based on interviews at 50 colleges and
high schools in 30 states and published in the July issue of
Reader's Digest magazine.
   According to the guide, the competition for entrance to
America's top colleges has become stiffer and costs are sometimes
higher than expected.
   ``The first step on the road to college is learning what a good
school looks for in an applicant, and then setting out to meet
those requirements,'' the guide advises.
   High school grades and standardized-test scores play a part in
the college admissions screening process, but students are also
judged on extracurricular activities, work experience, service to
community and church, special talents and skills.
   Other factors that may be considered are athletic ability,
unusual life experiences, character traits and even their response
to handicap and hardship, it adds.
   ``Sometimes such seeming irrelevancies as your geographic
location and whether you are the first generation of your family to
attend college can be deciding factors,'' the guide notes.
   Scholastic achievement is not simply based on grade average, it
adds. A student must also have followed a solid college-preparatory
curriculum _ which typically means at least three to four years of
math, science, social studies and a foreign languge, plus four
years of English.
   And the further along students get in those areas ``perhaps with
a fourth yer of foreign language or an advanced-math course like
calculus,'' the better their record looks to admissions officials.
   ``You really need to start mapping out your course plan in the
ninth grade,'' says Carol Lunkenheimer, director of admissions at
Northwestern University.
   The quality of high school attended by the student frequently is
taken into consideration by college officials.
   ``You can't judge a youngster from the `boondocks' the same way
you judge a student from a more sophisticated high school
environment,'' says Richard Cashwell, director of undergraduate
admissions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   But if you're from a less advantaged school, according to the
guide, you'd better be among the best of the students there, and be
able to show you took advantage of whatever challenges the school
did offer.
   In non-academic activities, factors that may be considered
include leadership, community spirit, volunteerism, competitive
nature, ability to work with others, and stick-to-itiveness.
   Applicants should also mention job experience, the guide
suggests, because ``it may show problem-solving ability and a
business sense. If you are working to save money for college, that
can also demonstrate your interest in assuming responsibility.''
   Once you've determined in general terms what you're looking for,
by far the best way to learn about a school is to visit it,
according to the guide.
   ``Every school has its own personality, just like people, and
you should look for the right fit,'' explains Donald Boulton, the
University of North Carolina's vice chancellor of student affairs.
   For those college-bound students worried about their chances of
getting into their top choice school, some consolation comes from
Charles Nolan, director of admissions for Boston College:
   ``Many students and their parents aren't satisfied with just a
college education; they must have a name-brand college. If I could
tell students and parents just one thing, it would be to relax.
   ``If you don't get into your first-choice college, it isn't the
end of the world; the course of your life probably won't be that
much different.''

   The government says more than half the 7
million undergraduates who enrolled in college full-time last year
received financial aid, compared with less than a quarter of the
4.2 million part-time students.
   For the 58 percent of the full-time students receiving financial
aid, the support from all sources _ the federal government, states
and the college itself _ averaged $3,813, according to a survey
released Wednesday by the Department of Education's Center for
Statistics.
   For the rest, the financial aid was $2,199 on average.
   Overall, 46 percent of the 11.2 million undergraduates received
some type of aid, with 35 percent getting federal help.
   While 24 percent of the part-timers got help from some source,
less than 1 in 7 got any help from Washington.
   The cost of attending college, including tuition, room, board,
books and other expenses, averaged $6,000 in the fall of 1986 for
the students. They were surveyed last spring about how they were
paying for college and what it cost.
   The center said 77 percent of all the students attended public
colleges, 18 percent private colleges and 5 percent proprietary, or
for-profit, trade schools.
   The trade school students were far more likely to draw financial
aid.

   Making the jump from high school senior to college freshman may
be traumatic for a youngster, but what about the parent?
   Pete Goldsmith, dean of student life at Old Dominion University
in Norfolk, Va., has some advice for being a ``successful'' college
parent:
   _ Stay informed. Read the school's newsletters and other
information that is generally sent to you by the college. Get your
own copy of the college catalog and student handbook.
   _ Get involved. Check into any parents' associations at the
school. In addition to feeling more a part of the college, you'll
make new friends.
   _ Communicate. Don't hesitate to call if you are concerned about
something innvolving the college or your child.
   _ Expect change. There will be times you may not like what your
child is doing or uncomfortable with thoughts expressed, but be
patient and understanding. And be flexible.
   _ Provide challenge and support. It's like teaching a child to
swim: the parent decides when to let him flounder and when to
rescue him. The college experience is no different. Parents need to
decide when to provide encouragement and when to intervene.
   When it comes to financial support beyond tuition, room, board
and books, take a walk through the campus, the bookstore and the
town. You'll gain a sense of what's appropriate.
   _ Show your interest. Ask about academic work. Visit the campus
on Parents' Weekend or other special occasions.
   _ Trust your student. You'd be surprised at the common sense
most students display.

   Faulty note taking, reading and review hamper a student's recall
of facts and learning material and results in poor grades and
frustration, according to the head of the Chicago-based American
Learning Corp.
   ``Recall is the ability to write, tell or think in your own
words what you have seen, experienced or read,'' explains Robert
Baseman, president of the company, a subsidiary of Encyclopaedia
Britannica, Inc.
   ``Studies have shown that most forgetting occurs during the
first few days after one has been exposed to new material or
studied it for the first time. In fact, the average student forgets
40 to 50 percent of what he's learned in only one day, and within
two days, he may forget up to 85 percent.''
   Baseman suggests students include some review every time they
read or complete a homework assignment. In so doing, he adds, they
will retain and understand more than if they wait to review a large
amount of material _ such as immediately before a test.
   The American Learning Corp. administers the Evelyn Wood Study
Dynamics program and operates more than 100 learning centers across
the nation.

   Children regarded as slow learners in school may actually be
coping with an unrecognized color vision deficiency, says the
American Optometric Association.
   The association recommends that all children have their color
vision tested by age 5, before they enter school and use
color-coded learning materials to determine the approximately 7
percent of boys and nearly 1 percent of girls who have color vision
deficiencies.
   Most children are unaware of their deficiencies, it says,
because they think everyone sees the way they do.
   Optometrists advise parents and teachers to help such children
to identify colors by name rather than appearance, labeling
crayons, markers or pencils with the color's name. Clothing also
could be labeled with words or symbols so that children can select
color-coordinated outfits.

students to study in front of the television set.
   Allowing them to listen to music while doing homework is another
question, however, and the guidelines suggest seeing what works
best for each child.
   ``Some students have no trouble concentrating with a radio or
stereo on,'' the guidelines observe.
   Parents also are advised to be cautious about offering money or
gifts as rewards for completing assignments or getting good grades.
   ``Most educators prefer to see parents reinforce student efforts

<HEAD>Gourmet Delivery Service Says Let Them Eat Squid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the only place in town that delivers
Kung Pao Squid, Veal Piccata, Quesadilla Ranchera and meat loaf.
   Waiters on Wheels Inc., the city's only gourmet delivery
service, offers a plethora of entrees that gives everyone from the
bedridden to the just plain lazy a chance to enjoy some of San
Francisco's most popular eateries without leaving home.
   Founded by two Greek immigrants about seven months ago, Waiters
on Wheels took what for many takeout eaters was a choice of pizza
or Chinese food and added French wine, steaks, pasta dishes and an
array of desserts.
   ``We wanted people in the city the chance to not have to eat
pizza,'' said Takis Zarikos, the company's co-founder, who has
lived in the United States for 10 years. ``We wanted to offer them
nice, gourmet food.''
   Last year, his partner Constantine Stathopoulous, who has lived
in the United States for 11 years, tired of having to settle for
pizza when he did not want to cook or go out. Over coffee one day,
the two friends decided to form a multi-restaurant home delivery
service.
   Both had years of experience in the San Francisco restaurant
business, Zarikos as a manager and Stathopoulous as a head waiter.
   The plan has been a success for them. Waiters on Wheels plans to
add 10 new restaurants to its fall menu, bringing the total to 28,
and is considering franchising east of San Francisco.
   There are similar companies in other cities, such as Chicago and
Los Angeles.
   To get a delivery, a customer calls Waiters On Wheels and places
an order from the company's 15-page brochure, where the restaurants
have their own menus printed. The service places the order with the
appropriate restaurant, via computer or telephone, and dispatches a
driver to pick up the order and delivers it anywhere within the
city limits.
   In addition to offering convenience to customers, Zarikos says,
the service can boost a restaurant's revenue.
   ``Restaurants can see that it is a way to make money without
costing them anything. They can produce more without hiring
additional help and they don't use up extra space,'' Zarikos said.
   However, a manager at Max's Diner, one of Waiters on Wheels'
most popular clients, noted the service had some drawbacks.
   ``Sales with them have been tremendous. That's the good side.
The bad side is, there's a lot of food we serve that shouldn't be
sitting around for awhile,'' said general manager Susan Cercone.
``Meat loaf, mashed potatoes and gravy aren't too good after
sitting around in Styrofoam for 45 minutes.''
   Bull's Texas Cafe, one of Waiters on Wheels' newest clients,
gave similarily mixed reviews. A Bull's manager, Jim Greaves, said
it was relatively expensive for his resaurant to start using
Waiters On Wheels for deliveries. The restaurant spent nearly $700
on various fees and packaging to bring in an additional $1700 in
sales last month, Greaves said.
   Although it is a ``terrific idea,'' one of the biggest drawbacks
is that if a meal is not to the customer's specification, Waiters
on Wheels requires that the restaurant not charge for it, Greaves
said.
   ``If that happened in a restaurant, we could easily correct it.
But once it's out to a person's house, beyond our means, there's
nothing we can do.''

   General Electric Co. has reached tentative
agreement with its two largest unions on a new three-year contract,
both sides reported.
   Negotiators for the company and the unions reached the accord
Sunday evening, several hours before the old contract was to
expire, said Jerry Borstel, spokesman for the International Union
of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried Machine and Furniture Workers
(IUE), and Jack Batty, a company spokesman.
   Earlier Sunday, the IUE and the United Electrical, Radio, and
Machine Workers of America (UE) gave the company a 10-day strike
notice, Borstel said.
   Details of the agreement were not released, pending ratification
by union members, who are scheduled to vote July 6.
   The IUE and UE have a combined membership of 47,000. Ten other
unions, representing another 21,000 GE workers, coordinate their
bargaining with the IUE and the UE although their contracts are
negotiated at the local plant level.
   The IUE represents about 40,000 workers in 75 locals at about
100 GE factories in Massachusetts, Kentucky, New York, Ohio and
Indiana. The UE represents about 6,300 GE employees in
Pennsylvania, Indiana and New York.
   The unions had said they were seeking a moratorium on plant
closings, a no-layoffs guarantee, better early retirement benefits,
stronger limits on subcontracting and other job security
improvements.
   They also wanted wage increases in each year of the new
contract, improvements in the cost of living formula, increases in
pension benefits, improvements in health and hospitalization
insurance, reimbursement for dependent care and prepaid
prescription drugs.

   British women fought years ago to clear
England's cramped coal mines of women and children, but now a push
is on to again open that nation's mining jobs to women.
   Fifteen years after the first American woman broke tradition and
went to work underground, a bill is pending before Parliament that
would set aside a law prohibiting Britain's coal companies from
hiring women miners, says Anne Scargill, whose husband, Arthur
Scargill, is president of the British National Union of Mineworkers.
   ``There's still some division about this, even among the
women,'' Mrs. Scargill said Sunday at the 10th National Conference
of Women Miners. ``Years ago, we fought to get women and children
out of the mines.''
   ``Where I live, in Silkstone in Yorkshire, we just had a
memorial service as we put up a monument for some kids who were
killed underground about 100 years ago _ about 80 kids, three,
four, and five years of age,'' she said.
   Mrs. Scargill said much of the division over the issue of women
in Britain's mines is generational.
   ``It's the kids who want the right to choose,'' she said.
   The NUM, to which all British miners belong, is still feeling
the effects of a year-long strike that idled the country's mines in
1984-85.
   The strike began when the National Coal Board, which controls
Britain's nationalized mining industry, proposed cutting coal
output to the lowest level of the 20th century. The plan called for
the elimination of an estimated 20,000 of Britain's 180,000 mining
jobs.
   The residue of the bitter strike, Mrs. Scargill said, is that
``we still have two lads in prison doing eight years, and we still
have 220 miners sacked.''
   Mrs. Scargill, accompanied by a group of other British mining
wives, traveled to the U.S. to explore the common ground they share
with American women miners.
   Much of that common ground was found in the ways they dealt with
the economic hardship of their long strike. In this country, the
problem is the unemployment that has ravaged the coal industry in
the last eight years, but the hardships have been much the same.
   ``The women here, they're the same as us,'' Mrs. Scargill said.
``They've got the same kind of things going that we did during the
strike, the support groups, the food pantries and soup kitchens we
needed to feed our families.''

<TEXT>
   The new leadership of Braniff Inc. pledges to
become a competitive force in the airline industry, but at least
one observer says reaching that goal will take time.
   Louis A. Marckesano, an airline industry analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said Sunday Braniff's market
position, wedged between the commuter airlines and the major
carriers, will make its survival difficult.
   ``That doesn't mean that they can't succeed,'' Marckesano said,
adding he doesn't expect any rapid expansion or downsizing of the
airline. ``I don't think we'll know the answer to that for a while.
They still have to find themselves a niche that they can survive in
long term.''
   BIA Acquisitions, an investor group led by PaineWebber Group
Inc., said Saturday it agreed to acquire Dallas-based Braniff in a
deal that values the airline at $111 million.
   Although Braniff posted a net loss of $8.1 million in the first
quarter, the airline has doubled its number of flights at Kansas
City International airport since the beginning of the year.
   Outgoing Braniff chairman J. Patrick Foley said the new
management will continue the expansion.
   Braniff primarily serves the Southwest, but analysts have
speculated it may try to reduce its operations at Dallas-Fort
Worth, where there is strong competition between American Airlines
and Delta Air Lines.
   BIA agreed to buy Braniff from Dalfort Aviation Inc., which is
owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago. BIA is paying $7 a share
in cash and a pro rata share of 20 percent of the restructured
airline for each share of Braniff common stock.
   BIA appointed five top executives who resigned from Piedmont
Airlines Friday to manage Braniff. The executives, led by new
chairman William McGee, flew to Dallas Sunday and were expected to
meet the company's employees and local media today.
   ``We intend for Braniff to become a strong competitive force in
our nation's air travel and hospitality industries,'' Jeffrey R.
Chodorow, one of BIA's leading investors, said in a statement
Saturday. He could not be reached at his Philadelphia home for
comment Sunday.
   The investor group has pledged to protect the jobs of Braniff's
2,600 employees for at least three years.
   Dalfort owned 64 percent of the airline's common stock and all
of its Series A preferred stock, which gave it more than 90 percent
of the stock voting rights.
   Dalfort will continue to hold a large equity stake in Braniff.

   Stock prices declined broadly today as traders
cashed in on the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 38.94 points
last week and reached its highest levels of the year, dropped back
8.36 to 2,134.60 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 284 up, 680
down and 444 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.16 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The dollar was strong in early foreign-exchange activity today.
But that failed to inspire bond traders.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Stocks came under similar light pressure amid some doubts that
the recent rally in the dollar would last much longer.
   Fort Howard Paper climbed 3] to 53. A group including top
executives of the company agreed to buy it out for $53 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.74 to 153.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.12 at 307.37.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.33 points to
2,142.96.
   Declines outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 in nationwide
trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 774 issues down, 662 up and 525
unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 179.88 million shares, against
185.77 million the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The main owner of the Seabrook nuclear power
plant acknowledged today that it has held preliminary meetings with
the state about possibly abandoning the troubled facility.
   ``We don't have any blinders on. We are willing to consider
anything,'' Robert Harrison, president of Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire said.
   But Harrison declined to speculate about the likelihood that
Seabrook would be scrapped, and said he still believes the $5.4
billion reactor will be licensed. The plant was completed in 1986
but left idle because it has not received a federal operating
license.
   Harrison disclosed the abandonment talks when asked if his
company would consider a deal similar to one worked out between the
state of New York and Long Island Lighting Co. involving the
Shoreham nuclear plant.
   A recent agreement in principle calls for LILCO to abandon the
plant in return for multibillion-dollar tax breaks, permission to
continue operating as a private company and a schedule of rate
increases.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit soared to a
record 1.705 billion pounds, or $2.9 billion, in May, with imports
running at their highest level since last summer, the government
reported Monday.
   The pound fell sharply on the news, losing about 1 cent against
the dollar to stand at $1.7043. Share prices on the London Stock
Exchange also took a beating.
   The seasonally adjusted trade deficit compared with a revised
deficit of 1.23 billion pounds, or $2.09 billion, in April and a
deficit of 1.06 billion pounds, or $1.8 billion, in May 1987, the
Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Analysts' forecasts for the merchandise trade gap had ranged
from 900 million, or $1.5 billion dollars, to 1.2 billion pounds,
or $2.04 billion.
   Meanwhile, Britain's current account shortfall in May, which
includes ``invisible trade'' such as services, overseas investment
earnings and official transfer payments, widened to a record 1.205
billion pounds, or $2.05 billion. That compared with a revised
deficit of 728 million pounds, or $1.24 billion, in April and a
deficit of 361 million pounds, or $614 million, in May 1987.
   Market forecasts for the May current account deficit rangd from
450 million pounds, or $765 million, to 800 million pounds, or
$1.36 billion.
   News of the wider-than-expected deficits pushed the pound down
against both the U.S. dollar and the West German Deutsche mark,
despite expectations that a further fall in the pound might prompt
the Bank of England to signal a rise in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate, which stands at 9 percent.
   The pound fell to $1.7043 about 15 minutes after the release of
the trade numbers, dropping from $1.7125 just prior to the
announcement. The pound fell to 3.1065 marks from 3.1230 marks.
   Stock prices also took a tumble. By midday, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was off around 20 points, or
1.1 percent, at the 1,850 level.
   British exports totaled 6.48 billion pounds, or $11 billion, in
May, down from 6.79 billion pounds, or $11.5 billion, in April and
up from 6.4 billion pounds (10.9 billion dollars) a year ago.
   Imports totaled a record 8.19 billion pounds, or $13.9 billion,
up from a revised 8.02 billion pounds, or $13.6 billion, in April
and up from 7.4 billion pounds, or $12.6 billion, last year.
   The government attributed the 2 percent rise in imports in May
to a high intake of erratic items, particularly precious stones and
aircraft. Imports were at their highest level since August 1987.

   Striking Australian coal miners
returned to work Monday, ending a national walkout that lasted more
than a week.
   Some of the 30,000 miners were on strike for 10 days protesting
changes in working conditions proposed by coal companies to keep
the mines working longer hours each week and more days each year.
   The proposed changes would include the introduction of
seven-day, 52-week rosters and changes to annual leave conditions.
A coal industry tribunal is currently considering the proposals.
   John Maitland, president of the Australian Miners' Federation,
said even though miners returned further job actions were possible
while the tribunal considered the matter.
   Australia is the world's biggest coal exporter.

   Another dry and searing forecast drove corn and
soybean futures prices up their daily limit in early trading today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Crop-damaging record-high temperatures over the weekend across
much of the Midwest gave way to cooler weather, but scattered
showers brought little relief from the drought, analysts said.
   The extended forecast from the National Weather Service fueled
further buying interest in the corn and soybean pits, calling for
another warming trend this week and no foreseeable rain until
Friday.
   ``It is the weather, it is the lack of rain,'' that continue to
encourage frenzied buying, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Corn for delivery in all months except December advanced the
10-cents-a bushel daily limit; while soybeans moved up the
30-cents-a bushel limit for all months except November.
   In early trading, wheat was 12 cent to 20 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.00\ a bushel; corn was 9{ cents
to 10 cents higher with the July contract at $3.52{ a bushel; oats
were 11 cents to 15 cents higher with the December contract at
3.74\ a bushel; and soybeans were 25 cents to 30 cents higher with
July at $10.59{ a bushel.
   Cattle and hog futures prices were mixed in early trading at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .43 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in August at 62.55 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .92 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 69.95
cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to 1.50 cents higher with July at
45 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to
1.90 cents higher with July at 37.85 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures advanced, hogs were mixed and pork bellies
retreated in trading Friday.

   A hearing in the Robert M. Bass Group's request
to halt publishing giant Macmillan Inc.'s planned restructuring has
been delayed until Wednesday.
   The hearing, which was to be held Monday in Delaware Chancery
Court before Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs, will be held instead
at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, a spokesman for the court confirmed.
   Bass has offered to acquire Macmillan for $1.9 billion, but the
company responded by announcing a restructuring that will separate
Macmillan's publishing and information services into two public
companies as well as pay shareholders a special dividend.
   Earlier this month Jacobs granted Bass's request for a temporary
injunction blocking the restrucurting.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Jacobs will hear arguments concerning a
preliminary injunction, which would void the proposed restructuring.

<HEAD>IBM Planning New Job Moves To Lower Costs, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. declined
to comment Monday on a published report that the leading computer
company plans another major redeployment of its work force to cut
costs.
   The Wall Street Journal, citing what it called unnamed industry
executives, said in Monday editions that the plan would require
several thousand people to change jobs and many of those to move.
It said the plan had yet to receive final approval from senior
management, but might be announced as early as this week.
   IBM, while declining to comment on the report, reaffirmed that
it remains ``fully committed'' to its practice of not laying off
employees.
   IBM just got through a massive redeployment in which 15,000
people worldwide accepted incentives to retire early and thousands
of others were moved to new jobs in 1986 and 1987. IBM eliminated
8,200 staff jobs and 16,000 manufacturing jobs while adding 11,000
jobs in its sales force and 7,700 to programming operations,
spokesman Michael Starks said.
   IBM's worldwide employment fell about 14,000 last year to
389,348 and its U.S. employment fell about 9,000 to 228,000, he
said.
   In spite of the cost-cutting efforts, IBM continues to hire
selectively in technical areas such as engineering, computer
science and programming and marketing areas such as marketing
representatives and systems engineers, Starks said.

   Bond prices headed lower in cautious early
trading today, reflecting concern about the dollar and the
direction of interest rates here and abroad.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond was off about { point, or $5 per
$1,000 face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to
its price, climbed to 8.92 percent from 8.85 percent late Friday.
   Trading started out on a down note following a drop in U.S. bond
prices overseas, despite the dollar's continued strength.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International, said bond investors were worried that the dollar's
rise in recent days could be coming to an end, especially amid
reports of central-bank intervention against the U.S. currency.
   ``I think at this point everyone realizes the dollar probably
has an upside that will be limited at some point,'' he said. ``If
the dollar draws back, people don't want to be involved in bonds.''
   A strong dollar is seen as bullish for the credit markets
because it makes dollar-denominated bonds and notes more attractive
to foreigners while lessening the prospects for higher inflation.
   Brusca said bond traders also were concerned today that interest
rates may be on the rise worldwide.
   There is widespread speculation that Britain, West Germany and
Japan might move to push up rates, and that the Federal Reserve
would be forced to reciprocate to remain competitive.
   In addition, the Fed faces the prospect of higher inflation due
to stronger-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy. Inflation
erodes the value of fixed-income securities.
   By midday in the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of
short-term governments declined [ point, intermediate maturities
fell between [ point and { point and long-term issues were down
around { point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
business-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.30 to 109.88. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
Daily Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, stood
at 1,150.24, down 2.95.
   In corporate trading, industrials lost \ point and utilities
were off [ point in light trading, according to the investment firm
of Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.38 to 283.81.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were up 5 basis points to
6.53 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 2 basis points to 6.77 percent and one-year
bills were up 4 basis points at 7.01 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7 9-16 percent, unchanged from late Friday.

<HEAD>With BC-Expensive Cities-List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strength of the Japanese yen has made Toyko
the world's most expensive city for expatriates for the third
straight year, according to a survey of 103 cities worldwide
released Monday.
   The Japanese port city of Osaka was a close second, followed by
the Iranian capital, Tehran, according to a bi-annual survey by
Business International, a Geneva-based research and consulting firm.
   The study uses a weighted index based on items including food,
alcohol, household supplies, tobacco, utilities, clothing and
entertainment, but excludes housing. It is aimed at helping
international companies determine cost-of-living differentials for
their expatriate employees.
   Using New York as the base for the study with a value of 100,
Tokyo had an index rating of 221, Osaka, 219, and Tehran, 192, the
survey said.
   New York was tied for 33rd place with Chicago and San Francisco.
The most expensive U.S. city was Los Angeles, in 30th place,
followed by Washington D.C.
   The drop in value of the U.S. dollar against European currencies
continued to make European cities expensive for expatriates who are
paid in the U.S. currency, the survey said.
   Oslo, Norway, remained the most expensive European city, in
seventh place overall. Zurich, Switzerland, was in ninth, tied with
Dakar, Senegal, and Geneva in 10th place.
   Five African cities ranked in the top ten: Libreville, Gabon,
182; Brazzaville, Congo, 168; Lome, Togo, 154; Abidjan, Ivory
Coast, 151; and Dakar, 143.
   Latin American cities remained among the least expensive for
expatriates despite massive inflation, since inflation in most
cities was offset by regular devaluation of their currencies, the
survey said.
   Caracas, Venezuela, remained the least expensive city with an
index value of 38. Buenos Aires, Argentina, was just slightly more
expensive with an index rating of 43.
   Survey results are based on exchange rates in effect on April 8,
a press release said.

<HEAD>Proposed Settlement In $5.8 Billion Nuke Plant Rate Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About $2 billion in design and construction
costs of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant would be paid by
utility shareholders under a settlement proposed today by the
operating company and state officials.
   The settlement also would increase electricity rates for Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. customers 1.6 percent, effective Friday, and 1.3
percent on Jan. 1 each of the next three years.
   Rates in future years would be based on how well the plant
operates, under a system of ``performance-based pricing'' that has
never been used for a major power plant in California. Usually,
utilities are allowed to charge rates based on how much of their
construction costs were found to be reasonable.
   The settlement was announced by PG&E, the staff of the
California Public Utilities Commission and state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp. It is subject to approval by the full commission.
   The company said it would take a one-time charge of $500 million
and reduce cash dividends to help absorb the cost of Diablo Canyon.
   The plant, located near an earthquake fault on the San Luis
Obispo coast, originally was to begin operating in the mid-1970s.
But design errors, discovery of the magnitude of the earthquake
fault, and federal licensing problems delayed operation by about a
decade and multiplied the cost 13-fold.
   Last year, the utility commission's Division of Ratepayer
Advocates recommended the utility not be allowed to collect $4.4
billion of the plant's original $5.5 billion costs by raising
rates. Additions to the plant since have pushed the total cost to
$5.8 billion.
   Under today's settlement, PG&E would face no specific
disallowance.
   However, the $500 million charge is expected to virtually
eliminate the company's 1988 earnings after taxes, and the company
will have to reduce its cash dividend from $1.92 per share to a new
annualized rate of $1.40 per share.
   Under the ``performance-based'' arrangement, if Diablo Canyon
operates as well as the average large U.S. nuclear plant, about
$2.1 billion of the construction cost will be charged to
shareholders, and customers would pay the rest, Van de Kamp said.
   The more efficiently the plant operates, the more of the cost
customers would pay; on the other hand, they would pay less for
other fuels that PG&E would have to use when the plant was shut
down.
   PG&E officials said the settlement means customers will
initially pay about 25 percent less for power from Diablo Canyon
than if the company had gotten permission to fully recover the
plant's costs.
   The company said rates will increase ``only by about 5 percent''
under the proposed settlement.
   A public hearing on the settlement is scheduled for Wednesday.
The agreement is subject to approval by the Public Utilities
Commission, whose members were not part of the negotiations.
   Bill Ahern, director of the utility commission's Division of
Ratepayer Advocates, hailed the proposed settlement as ``a
tremendously good deal for PG&E's customers.
   ``It provides at least $2 billion in customer savings over the
next few years, and it shifts the financial risks of runaway
nuclear plant costs and poor plant operation from the customers to
PG&E's stockholders,'' he said.
   In a letter to shareholders, PG&E's chairman and chief executive
officer, Richard A. Clarke, said the settlement provided ``the best
alternative for shareholders, including the potential for
substantial earnings growth over time.''

<HEAD>Senate Increases Anti-Drug Spending, Cuts IRS Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Monday to slash the proposed
1989 Internal Revenue Service budget by $241 million and use the
money for the Customs Service's anti-drug program.
   The anti-drug measure was part of a larger bill that also calls
for a 4 percent pay increase in 1989 for all federal civilian
employees except members of Congress, and 4.1 percent for military
personnel. The Senate approved an amendment requiring that no
future pay increase for members of Congress take effect until voted
on separately by the House and Senate.
   The White House had opposed reducing the IRS spending. It
cautioned that the ``impact of this reduced level on returns
processsing and taxpayer services would be devastating.'' IRS
Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs had complained that the reduction
could cut revenues by $1.4 billion next year.
   The cut in the IRS budget, to the 1988 level of just under $5.1
billion, was part of a bill that included $15.9 billion for the
Treasury Department and its agencies, the Postal Service and
several other federal agencies. The vote was 81-4.
   The spending bill is $246 million less than the administration
asked and $196.3 million below what the House passed. The measure
is about $801 million over what was appropriated for the same
agencies for 1988.
   When he sent his budget to Congress in January, President Reagan
asked for a $241 million increase for the IRS ``to improve the
speed and accuracy of tax processing and expand information
services provided to taxpayers'' in light of the 1986 tax overhaul.
The House agreed.
   When the Senate panel was considering the appropriations bill
last week, James C. Miller III, director of the White House Office
of Management and Budget, said that holding the IRS budget to this
year's level would ``jeopardize service to the public both in terms
of taxpayer inquiries and timely returns processing.''
   ``These areas are particularly high priorities of the
administration, given the need to implement tax reform fully and
the desire to avoid repeating the disruptions of the 1985 filing
season,'' Miller wrote.
   However, the Senate committee concluded that ``the level of
funding proposed by the committee will allow the IRS to meet its
revenue-raising targets established in the'' deficit-reduction
agreement reached by the White House and Congress last year.
   The bill includes $1.05 billion for the Customs Service, which
is $79 million above what the administration requested and $41
million over what the House passed.
   ``I am proud to say that this bill goes the extra mile, beyond
the president's budget to maintain our important anti-drug effort
at some of the most important drug enforcement agencies,'' said
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on the treasury, postal service and
general government, which wrote the measure.
   As part of the Customs Service efforts against illegal drugs,
the bill recommends the agency buy a surveillance airship capable
of carrying a sensor that can detect ship movements in the Gulf of
Mexico. The measure includes money for customs to develop four
long-range P-3 Orion planes to use in drug surveillance missions.
   The Senate approved an amendment by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
suggesting that the Postal Service not activate the second part of
a contract with Perot Systems Corp. until the General Accounting
Office studies the contract. The corporation, headed by billionaire
H. Ross Perot, would get a share of the profits from cost-saving
suggestions it made to the Postal Service.
   Simon contends such a lucrative contract should not have been
awarded without bids.

<HEAD>Dollar Soars Against Foreign Currencies, But Outlook is Unclear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar has soared to its highest levels
against European currencies in eight months, but market watchers
remained divided Monday about whether the currency's weeks-long
rally represents a lasting reversal or a temporary blip.
   ``Fundamentally, the dollar has now changed its trend and
instead of trending lower all those years since 1985, the dollar is
in an upward move,'' asserted Paul Chertkow, director of currency
economics at the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   But Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at James Capel
and Co., said, ``Markets have gotten themselves quite excited about
the dollar short-term. We think we're going to see new lows still.''
   After months of stability, the dollar has jumped 5 percent
against the British pound, 4.4 percent against the Japanese yen and
3.7 percent against the West German mark in home currency markets
since last Monday.
   The dollar surged Monday to its highest point against the
British pound since October. The pound fell 4 cents to $1.7030 by
late afternoon in Europe, from $1.7430 on Friday, on news of a
worse-than-expected, record British merchandise trade deficit in
May.
   The dollar jumped to 1.8185 West German marks from 1.8010 marks
on Friday, also the highest level since October.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 2.00 yen to a closing 131.70
yen in Tokyo, its highest level since early December.
   The dollar has been helped by improvements in the U.S. trade
deficit and strong demand for dollar-denominated securities,
especially by the Japanese.
   In addition, speculators have been able to push the dollar
higher without a concerted effort by central banks to counter their
attempt, dealers said.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve did intervene a bit on Monday, selling
dollars, which, along with a bit of profit-taking, took some steam
out of the rally, dealers said. The West German Bundesbank also
intervened in a limited way, as it has in recent weeks.
   But the session's intervention, although a warning, was not
significant or concerted, dealers said.
   The dollar has been boosted by the communique issued at the end
of the world economic summit in Toronto last week, which led the
markets to believe that the seven major industrialized nations
would tolerate a higher dollar to counter inflation.
   The industrialized countries again reiterated their commitment
to stabilize currency exchange rates, which they first made in
February 1987. In September 1985, they had agreed to push the
dollar lower.
   ``What we're seeing is an acknowledgement by the Group of Seven
countries following their meeting in Toronto that they they have
given some scope for the dollar to rise,'' said Tim O'Dell, senior
international economist at the London investment firm Phillips and
Drew Ltd.
   Support also has come from growth in global demand for the
dollar, particularly from Japanese financial institutions, such as
life insurance companies, which are buying up U.S. stocks and bonds
again for the first time in months, dealers said.
   Relatively high U.S. interest rates have made dollar-denominated
investments more attractive, analysts said.
   The dollar remains strong even though interest rates in Britain
and West Germany have been rising in recent weeks, which would make
investments in those countries more competitive.
   The strong demand for the dollar, underscored by high trading
volume in the foreign exchange markets, in turn has spurred
speculative interest in the currency, dealers said.
   The gain has been feeding on itself since the dollar leaped past
several psychological barriers, such as 1.8 West German marks and
130 Japanese yen.
   It was the release of better-than-expected U.S. trade data two
weeks ago that set the scene for the dollar's climb, analysts said.
   The Commerce Department reported on June 14 that the merchandise
trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $9.89 billion in
April, its lowest level since 1984, from $11.7 billion dollars in
the previous month.
   But the outlook for the dollar is unclear.
   ``There is a lot more upside potential,'' said the bullish
Chertkow, forecasting a dollar of 1.9 marks and 135 yen.
   But it is not known how high a level the central banks would
allow.
   ``There may be a level that is a new ceiling or a range agreed
to in Toronto,'' O'Dell said.
   Several dealers speculated that the central banks would not step
in together until the market's recent bullishness was spent.
   Some analysts said the long-term trend is bearish because of the
still-large U.S. trade deficit, fears of inflation in Europe, and
the uncertainty presented by the U.S. general election.
   ``There isn't much scope for the dollar to rise on a sustained
basis,'' O'Dell said.

   Share prices skidded lower Monday on the London
Stock Exchange following the release of a dismal trade deficit
report for May.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 29.8
points, or 1.6 percent, lower at 1,841.5.
   Trading volume was a modest 390.7 million shares, compared with
Friday's 589.0 million shares.
   Dealers said there was severe disappointment that Britain's
merchandise trade gap soared to a record 1.705 billion pounds, or
$2.9 billion, in May, with imports running at their highest level
since last summer.
   Analysts had predicted the trade gap would range from 900
million pounds, or $1.5 billion, to 1.2 billion pounds, or $2.04
billion.
   The pound plummeted 4 cents against the dollar on the news,
ending at $1.7030.
   The government report was ``really ghastly and beyond even the
worst expectations,'' said Glenn Davies, an economist at
CL-Alexanders Laing Cruickshank Ltd.
   ``The problem for equities is that the only option at this
moment available to the government to curtail domestic demand is to
raise base (interest) rates,'' Davies said.
   A dealer said the figures were so bad that they ``beg for severe
measures and it's only a question of how quickly and by how much
the government will put up interest rates.''
   Several market watchers predicted a half percentage-point rise
to 9.5 percent in the British commercial banks' base lending rate
as soon as Tuesday, with another half-point hike sometime during
the week if the British currency does not show signs of recovery.

   Corn and soybean futures prices surged up their
daily limits Monday at the Chicago Board of Trade in a
drought-driven rally fueled by another hot and dry forecast.
   ``They opened limit up, they traded limit up, they closed limit
up,'' said Cathy Leow, a New York-based grains analyst with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc.
   ``We're trading forecasts,'' she said. ``While the weekend was
dry ... basically we're looking at dryness through the rest of the
week'' across the major growing regions.
   The buying mania was further fueled by a USDA crop-rating report
to be released late Monday, which was expected to show continued
deterioration of the nation's corn and soybean crops, she said.
   Corn for delivery in all months advanced the 10-cents-a bushel
daily limit; while soybeans moved up the 30-cents-a bushel limit
for all months except November 1989.
   At the close, wheat was 12 cents to 20 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $4 a bushel; corn was 10 cents
higher across the board, with the July contract at $3.52{ a bushel;
oats were 15 cents higher across the board, with September at $3.79

<HEAD>IBM's Competitors Caught Off Guard By Patent Stance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM has caught some other companies off guard
with a get-tough position on patents for a burgeoning new computer
technology known as Risc.
   IBM confirmed Monday it has approached some companies about
their use of IBM patents in products that use Risc, short for
reduced instruction set computer.
   Risc is considered critical to the future of the computer
industry because it dramatically speeds up computing by simplifying
the instructions that microprocessors have to perform.
   Spokesmen for several companies that have used Risc technology
in the design of new microprocessors said their lawyers had not
been contacted by IBM and they did not know what the computer giant
wanted.
   IBM's policy on Risc was first reported in Saturday's editions
of the New York Times. It was consistent with IBM's statement
earlier this year that it intended to be more rigorous in its
enforcement of its patents.
   IBM said Monday its more than 9,000 U.S. patents go well beyond
Risc to include technology that is fundamental to the computer
industry.
   In a far-reaching statement, it said, ``We believe that anyone
who is developing an information-handling system would probably
need to use an IBM patent.''
   IBM is not trying to shut down competitors using Risc. The
company has said it is willing to license all of its patents to
other companies for reasonable terms and conditions.
   Sun Microsystems Inc., the fast-growing Silicon Valley
workstation maker, would seem to be a prime target for IBM
enforcement because it has a popular new chip called Sparc that is
based on Risc technology. Sun's design has been adopted by such
companies as Unisys Corp., Xerox Corp. and American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.
   But Sun spokeswoman Carol Broadbent said Monday, ``We have not
been approached ... We'll just have to wait and see, if IBM does
approach and what kind of move they make.''
   At Motorola Inc., whose new 88000 family of microprocessors is
Risc-based, spokesman Charles Sengstock said, ``All we know is
essentially what we've read.''
   At Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which uses Risc technology in
its new 29000 chip family, spokesman John Greenagel said, ``We have
not been contacted by them, so we're kind of in the dark as to what
might be going on.''
   Greenagel said he was pleased by reports that IBM _ its biggest
customer _ does not intend to try to shut down other companies
using Risc.
   ``If IBM thinks there is a problem with us, we'll give it very
careful attention. But at this point we're not aware what this
problem may be,'' Greenagel said.
   IBM announced earlier this year that in new licensing
agreements, it was asking licensees to pay it from 1 percent to 5
percent of the revenue from products that use IBM patents,
depending on the number of patents used and the extent of their use.
   Many companies already have cross-licensing agreements with IBM
that would protect them from having to pay for use of patents, Risc
or otherwise.

   Pillsbury Co. said Monday its fourth-quarter
profit rose 51 percent, but its earnings for all of fiscal 1988
fell 62 percent compared with a year earlier because of a huge
restructuring charge.
   Earnings for the three months ended May 31 rose to $47.8
million, or 56 cents a share, from $31.6 million, or 37 cents a
share a year earlier. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 1 percent to
$1.55 billion from $1.53 billion.
   For the full year, net earnings fell to $69.3 million, or 81
cents a share, compared with $181.9 million, or $2.10 a share, in
fiscal 1987.
   Annual sales rose slightly to $6.19 billion from $6.13 billion.
   The restructuring reduced earnings for the full year by $140.9
million, or $1.64 per share, but none of it was booked in the
fourth quarter.
   ``Periodically, every company must make the necessary changes to
re-establish itself in the marketplace,'' William H. Spoor,
Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement. ``We have now entered fiscal 1989 with direction,
confidence and discipline.''
   The restructuring charge covered the sale of the Godfather's
Pizza, Quik Wok, Bay Street and Key West Grill restaurant chains,
and 30 Steak and Ale and Bennigan's restaurants. It also covered a
writedown of assets at Burger King, the consolidation of several
food manufacturing plants and a reduction in administrative
personnel throughout the company.
   For fiscal 1988, the company's foods division posted a 6 percent
sales gain to $3.56 billion on a 1 percent increase in unit volume.
Operating profit rose 6 percent to $280.5 million.
   Excellent performances were turned in by the refrigerated dough,
ice cream, international and industrial divisions, Spoor said. But
he said weaknesses in pizza and seafood held back profit growth.
   In the fourth quarter, food sales rose 9 percent to $904.6
million and unit sales rose 5 percent, but operating profit slipped
2 percent to $51.2 million.
   In the restaurant division, sales fell 5 percent for the year to
$2.63 billion and operating profit fell 8 percent to $217.2 million.
   Spoor attributed the decline to flat sales at individual units
and to a drop in sales at the company's restaurant supply
subsidiary.
   In the fourth quarter, Pillsbury's restaurant sales declined 8
percent to $649 million and operating profit declined 10 percent to
$65 million.
   The decline was attributed to a decline in its restauarnt supply
subsidiary and at its full-service restaurants where profit was off
sharply because of the expense of new menus, training and
additional staffing.

   The West German government said Monday
it has approved the sale of Texaco Inc.'s West German subsidiary to
the utility Rheinisch-Westphaelische Elektrizitaetswerk AG.
   The Federal Cartel Office determined that RWE ``would not secure
a controlling monopoly of the market with the purchase,'' said
Hubertus Schoen, a spokesman for the office.
   RWE, West Germany's largest utility and its eighth-largest
corporation, is active in the production and supply of electricity,
coal mining and the petroleum and chemicals businesses.
   Texaco announced June 6 it had agreed to sell its West German
subsidiary Deutsche Texaco AG to RWE for $1.23 billion as part of
the U.S. company's $5 billion restructuring plan. The sale was
subject to West German government approval.
   Schoen also said the office would not stand in the way of a
proposal to allow Norway's state oil company, Stat-oil, to have a
stake in the new RWE unit.
   RWE officials say an association with Stat-oil would boost RWE's
refining sector earnings. Stat-oil could supply crude oil to the
West German market and also use its refineries to supply that
market with oil products, officials said.
   The officials said the company will include the Texaco
subsidiary into a newly-formed unit, RWE Mineral Oil and Chemical
Corp.
   Deutsche Texaco is active in all phases of the oil business,
from exploration and production to petrochemicals. It owns two
refineries, capable of producing 140,000 barrels daily, and holds a
10.2 percent share of the West German retail gasoline market, with
about 1,900 Texaco-branded retail outlets throughtout the country.
   Deutsche Texaco currently employs about 4,200 workers.

lead-lined tanks in its water coolers is being asked to recall its
coolers in the wake of a report that some of its tanks had been
lined with lead solder.
   The request was made last week by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
chairman of the health and environment subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, after the Environmental Protection
Agency told Waxman and the company of its test results.
   EPA, which discovered lead in water from coolers used by the
Navy last year, tested 20 Navy coolers, 12 of them made by Halsey
Taylor of Freeport, Ill., a subsidiary of Household International
Inc., according to documents provided by a subcommittee source.
   Eight of the 12 had been lined with lead solder, which is 50
percent lead. Water from one of them was contaminated with lead at
a concentration of 2,000 parts per billion _ 40 times the current
federal drinking water standard and 100 times the standard EPA
expects to adoptlater this year.
   Two coolers with solder-lined tanks were missing identification
tags. The other six carried model numbers WT8A, GC10A and GC10ACR,
according to a letter from EPA to the company.
   Lead is a poison that damages the brain, kidneys and other
organs. Children are particularly vulnerable because their brains
are still being formed.
   Halsey Taylor, a leader in the refrigerated water cooler
industry, made coolers using lead solder to connect piping from
1978 to 1987. Until this February, it also used lead solder to coat
the outside of the reservoir tank for better heat transfer.
   In 1979, it inspected 14,000 coolers whose tanks might have had
pinhole leaks that permitted the outside solder coating to get
inside during manufacture, said Tom Klein, director of marketing
for Halsey Taylor. He said many were repaired, but he did not have
the number at hand.
   The company wrote Waxman in February that it had ``never
designed or manufactured a water coller that used a `lead-lined' or
lead tank.'' It was clear from context that the company was
referring to inside, not outside, lining.
   Michael Cook, head of EPA's water office, said in an interview
Friday it was ``conceivable'' the eight tanks also had leaks, but
he did not think so because ``the solder is in a uniform layer
inside.''
   Cook said EPA had offered tank samples on which the company
could run its own tests and was awaiting a response. Klein said the
company had asked for those samples and was unaware of Cook's offer.
   A company representative had seen the tanks, he said, and Cook
was correct that the solder seemed to coat the inside of the tank
uniformly. However, that could have happened from the same
malfunction that cause the 1979 inspection and repair program, he
said, and the company believes Cook's tanks came from the same
batch of more than 38,000 that possibly could have pinhole leaks,
Klein said.
   ``We are not hiding our head in the sand; we are cooperating
with Congressman Waxman,'' said Klein. ``We've gone the extra step
to make sure our the coolers are safe'' by switching to a non-lead
solder for tank coating in February.
   He repeated that the company had never manufactuered a cooler
with a lead tank or lead inside lining, as far as it knew: ``We've
checked our records on this and we're checking them again.''
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., a member of the subcommittee,
planned to introduce a bill Wednesday to require EPA to help
schools test and renovae water systems contaminated by lead, to
forbid the sale of lead-containing coolers and to require
manufacturers to recall any previously sold, and to force EPA to
make the new standard 10 ppb instead of 20 ppb.
   EPA has estimated that 42 million Americans use tap water
containing lead above 20 ppb, of which 3.8 million are children
under age 6. Approximately 241,000 children under 6 are getting
enough lead to harm them, the agency says.
   The Water Test Corp. of Manchester, N.H., wrote Waxman that it
would test samples without charge for schools that request it.
Schools would have to get sample bottles from the company and pay
shipping charges.

   Sales of existing homes, propelled by fears of
rising mortgage rates, rose 3.1 percent in May, the fourth
consecutive monthly increase, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.63 million units in May, following an even larger 5.7 percent
increase in April.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors group, said that
existing home sales will probably begin to decline in coming months
to around an annual rate of 3.4 million units as mortgage rates
move higher.
   ``The anticipation of continued rising interest rates convinced
homebuyers to get into the market now rather than waiting,''
Tuccillo said. ``Existing home sales are at a peak right now and we
would expect sales to drop late in the year, because of slowly
rising rates.''
   Fixed-rate mortgage, which had dipped to a low of 9.84 percent
in February, have been rising and now stand at 10.4 percent,
according to the latest weekly survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   The median price of an existing home rose $1,300 from April to
May, climbing to $88,600, a 3 percent increase from the median
sales price a year ago of $86,000.
   The May sales increase was led by a 10.4 percent rise in sales
in the Northeast, where homes were sold at an annual rate of
740,000 units. Sales rose 3.2 percent in the Midwest to an annual
rate of 960,000 units.
   Sales in the South rose 2.3 percent to an annual rate of 1.34
million units while sales advanced 1.6 percent in the West to an
annual rate of 620,000 units.
   Of the four regions, the Northeast was again the leader in the
rate of price increases, with a median sales price of $148,700 last
month, 11 percent higher than a year ago.
   In the West, the median price of $122,000 was 10.2 percent
higher than in May 1987. The Midwest posted a 2.7 percent price
increase to $68,300 while in the South the median sales price of
$83,600 was 1.6 percent higher than a year ago.
   The association is forecasting that 3.34 million existing homes
will be sold this year, a decline of 5.1 percent from the 3.53
milion homes sold in 1987.

   Rising interest rates and commodity prices
helped send the stock market into a broad retreat Monday as traders
cashed in on the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 38.94 points last
week, dropped back 34.50 to 2,108.46.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
428 up, 1,089 down and 441 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 264.41 million
shares, against 179.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 291.96 million shares.
   Almost half the day's total activity came in high-yielding
utility issues with impending dividends _ chiefly Southern
California Edison, down \ at 34 on turnover of more than 98 million
shares, and Northern States Power, down [ at 32[ on turnover of
more than 12 million shares.
   The dollar was strong in early foreign-exchange activity Monday.
But that failed to inspire bond traders.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $10 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Stocks came under similar pressure amid doubts that the recent
rally in the dollar would last much longer.
   Brokers said traders were also troubled by a continued rise in
agricultural commodity prices associated with the drought in the
Midwest.
   Deere & Co. fell 2| to 44] amid concern about the drought's
potential impact on sales of farm equipment.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down 1] at 44];
DuPont, down 1~ at 89|; Eastman Kodak, down 1[ at 44{; General
Electric, down 1[ at 42|, and USX, down 1\ at 31{.
   Some stocks involved in takeover news and rumors bucked the
downtrend. Fort Howard Paper climbed 4\ to 53~ on word that a group
including top executives of the company agreed to buy it out for
$53 a share.
   York International jumped 5[ to 55|. The company said an
investor group agreed to acquire it for $50.50 a share in cash plus
$7 a share in debentures.
   Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, dropped 2] to 78{. The Securities and
Exchange Commission brought insider-trading charges against a young
analyst at the firm.
   View-Master Ideal Group, which said it had stopped looking into
merger possibilities and planned to remain independent, fell 1] to
5] in the over-the-counter market.
   L.A. Gear, another OTC issue, gained 1[ to 30~. The company,
which makes sports and leisure footwear, said it would report
quarterly earnings above analysts' estimates.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $38.22 billion, or 1.40
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.34 to 152.22.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 5.74 to 310.44, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.72 at 269.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.62 to 389.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 306.62, down 1.87.

   The dollar soared Monday to its highest point
since last October against some major currencies, but reports of
dollar-selling by the U.S. central bank knocked it off the day's
highs.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted gold at a bid of $442.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
40 cents from late Friday.
   Traders said reports of intervention by the Federal Reserve had
limited effect because there was no firm evidence the Fed actually
had sold dollars, at least in large amounts.
   The dollar's rapid ascent _ it has climbed roughly 4 percent
against the Japanese yen and the West German mark in the past week
_ left traders wondering whether the rise could continue.
   ``I don't know what will stop it. We'd have to have a nasty
surprise,'' said Francoise Soars-Kemp, treasury vice president for
Credit Suisse in New York. But she also said, ``The market is
likely to turn tail at any moment if it gets upset. I can't say
with any confidence that the dollar is firmly on its way back up.''
   Traders said corporate buying bolstered the dollar Monday.
   ``All the multinationals who basically missed out on buying
dollars came in,'' said Peter Wild, senior trader for Bank Julius
Baer & Co. in New York.
   The dollar soared against the British pound on news of a record
British merchandise trade deficit in May. The pound fell to $1.7030
in London from $1.7430 late Friday, its lowest point against the
dollar since October. Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.7025
from $1.7270 late Friday.
   The dollar peaked at 1.8300 West German marks in Europe, but
fell back on the reports of Fed intervention to finish at 1.8185
marks, up from 1.8010 on Friday and its highest point since
October. Later in New York the dollar closed at 1.8216 marks, up
from 1.8155 Friday but off from its highs of the session.
   Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 2 yen to a closing
131.70 in Tokyo, its highest point since December. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 130.93 yen. At the end of the trading day
in New York, the dollar closed at 131.14 yen, up from 130.53 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.5078 Swiss francs, up from 1.5030; 1.2063
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2033; 6.1478 French francs, up from
6.1110; and 1,351.00 Italian lire, up from 1,330.37 late Friday.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates,
included: 1.5050 Swiss francs, up from 1.4945; 6.1385 French
francs, up from 6.0635; 2.0460 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0305;
1,353.48 Italian lire, up from 1,330.37; and 1.2075 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2050.
   Gold bullion fell in Hong Kong by $1.55 a troy ounce to close at
a bid of $444.14.
   Later in London, gold fell to a late bid of $441.50 a troy ounce
from Friday's $442.90. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $443.00,
compared with $442.90 late Friday.
   Gold bullion for current delivery closed unchanged at $443 a
troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Silver bullion prices were unchanged on the London market where
the metal traded at a late bid of $6.84 a troy ounce. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $6.936 a troy
ounce from $6.800 an ounce late Friday.

<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction, with rates on
three-month bills rising to the highest level since October while
rates on six-month bills edged down.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.59 percent, up from 6.51 percent
last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 6.75 percent, down from 6.83 percent last
week.
   The rate on three-month bills was the highest since an average
of 6.84 percent last Oct. 19. The rate on six-month bills was the
lowest since they sold for 6.67 percent two weeks ago.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 6.80 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,833.40 and 7.08 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,658.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.53 percent last
week from 7.40 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   The first shipment to Japan of 5,000
Panasonic television sets built at a suburban Chicago left Monday
amid fanfare and predictions that it would be the first of many.
   ``Hopefully, this is just a small beginning to what ultimately
will lead to a more balanced trading situation between all
countries of the world _ but especially the United States and
Japan,'' said Richard Kraft, president of Matsushita Industrial
Co., a subsidiary of the Japanese consumer giant Matsushita, which
markets some of its products under the Panasonic brand name.
   The 27-inch color television sets were part of an initial order
of 5,000 sets. While U.S.-made materials account for about 70
percent of each set, Kraft noted the televisions are ``virtually
unusuable in this country'' because the settings, the power supply
and the frequencies are adapted for foreign use.
   ``Japan is a different market, and these sets today represent an
honest attempt to market and sell a product based on conditions
there ... not just send over whatever we build,'' he added.
   ``With this kind of thinking and this kind of product, we can
make genuine inroads,'' said Kraft.
   He said Matsushita decided to build the sets in Franklin Park
because of savings of about 10 percent and the availability of
American craftsmen to design and build the cabinets out of U.S.
hardwoods.
   Kraft said he could not estimate what the set would cost in
Japan, but a comparable product for the U.S. market would range
between $1,500 and $2,000.
   State Department of Commerce spokesman Wally Biermann said
exports from Illinois to Japan were up 46 percent for the first
four months of this year compared to last.
   ``These are not just gestures of goodwill, but hard-core
economic decisions,'' Paul O'Connor, another state Commerce
Department spokesman said. ``If the dollar remains weak against the
yen, you'll see more and more of this.''
   Gov. James R. Thompson joined executives and 800 workers for a
brief ceremony at the plant, which manufactures more than one
million sets for the North American market.

<HEAD>Drought Sends Corn, Beans Skyrocketing; Hits Other Markets, Too</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices jumped their daily limits higher
Monday at the Chicago Board of Trade following another hot, dry
forecast and fears of further crop damage from the midwestern
drought.
   The drought-related buying spree spilled onto other exchanges:
cotton futures prices soared while cattle and hog prices rallied
sharply on drought-related speculation.
   In other markets, silver surged while gold was mixed and energy
prices declined.
   ``We're trading forecasts,'' said Cathy Leow, a New York-based
grains analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. ``While the
weekend was dry...basically we're looking at dryness through the
rest of the week'' across the major growing regions.
   BOT traders also were buying in anticipation of a late-Monday
USDA report expected to show continued deterioration of the
nation's corn and bean crops, she said.
   The USDA weekly crop condition report, issued after the close of
trading, showed deterioration in all states in the major growing
regions, ``with the corn and soybean crops in mostly fair to poor
condition,'' Ms. Leow said,
   Corn for delivery in all months advanced the 10-cents-a bushel
daily limit; and soybeans moved up the 30-cents-a bushel limit for
all months.
   Wheat settled 14{ cents to 20 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $4{ a bushel; corn was 10 cents higher across
the board, with the July contract at $3.52{ a bushel; oats were 15
cents higher across the board, with September at $3.78 a bushel;
and soybeans settled 30 cents higher across the board with July at
$10.59{ a bushel.
   Cotton prices surged in trading at the New York Cotton Exchange,
with deferred months advancing the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit in
sympathy with skyrocketing grains prices, said Ed Whitten, a cotten
specialist with New York-based Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Cotton settled .95 cent to 2.70 cents higher for the nearby July
contract, which has no daily limit. The July contract was at 68.80
cents a pound.
   Weekend rain in some parts of the cotton belt eased dry
conditions but rain still was needed in the central belt and
southeast, he said. Cotton doesn't require as much moisture as
soybeans and grains, but still was being hurt by the drought,
Whitten said.
   Cattle and hog futures prices advanced sharply in trading at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Expectations of a long-term drop in supplies sparked a buying
wave that pushed prices up the 1.50 cents-a-pound daily limit in
deferred contracts for cattle and hogs, and up the 2 cents limit in
pork bellies, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with
Thomson McKinnon Securities.
   ``There is assumption that there is liquidation going on right
now in the breeding herd'' as the drought damages feed crops,
Stanley said. That means a short-term influx of beef and pork but
an anticipated tightening of supplies down the road, he said.
   Live cattle settled 1.35 cents to 1.50 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in August at 64.15 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .70 cent to 1.23 cents higher with the August contract
at 71.55 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.28 cents to 1.50 cents
higher, with July at 46.20 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .85 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 39.05 cents a pound.
   Gold futures prices were mixed while silver rallied sharply in
trading at the New York Commodity Exchange.
   Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said silver was supported by inflationary
speculation stemming from the rally in soybeans and grains, while
gold was depressed by the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.
   Gold settled 10 cents lower to 10 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in June at $443 a troy ounce; silver was 13 cents to
13.6 cents higher with June at $6.936 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices retreated at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 11 cents to 19 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in August at $15.86 a barrel; heating oil was .18 cent
to .55 cent lower with July at 42.59 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline settled .38 cent lower to .14 cent higher with July at
51.05 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Management Says It Retains Board Majority In Proxy Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. claimed Monday
its management retained control of the 13-member board of directors
in a proxy contest against dissident shareholders, who apparently
won five of seven seats up for election.
   Management based its claim on preliminary results of a June 20
vote released by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which judged the
election. Final results are expected July 5.
   The results claimed by management followed last week's
announcement by Speer Leeds claiming that, based on its analysis,
the dissidents had won five seats, with two others still in doubt.
   ``Now we can proceed with business as usual,'' Chairman Oliver
S. Travers said. ``Our first priority is a successful
reorganization to emerge from Chapter 11 protection as soon as
possible.''
   The dissidents, led by the New York brokerage firm Speer, Leeds
& Kellogg, attempted to win four of seven open board seats at the
shareholders meeting. In addition, Allegheny International's
failure to pay dividends gave the holders of two classes of
preferred stock the right to place their nominees in three seats.
   Two management nominees, Travers and Morris W. Offit, apparently
won election, giving management control of eight seats. The Speer,
Leads & Kellogg group gained five seats, including two elected by
common shareholders and three nominees to uncontested seats.
   ``The results of the election from the prelminary tally firm
management's commitment to continue running the compnay in the best
interests of all the company's constituencies, including all
classes of equity,'' Travers said.
   The dissidents claimed they could reorganize the troubled
consumer products company under a plan that would improve the
market value of the company's stock.

<HEAD>Macmillan Reaffirms Rejection of Bass Takeover Overtures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. reaffirmed Monday its earlier
rejection of a $1.9 billion takeover proposal from a group led by
Texas investor Robert Bass.
   The publishing and information services giant said a special
committee of its board had also reaffirmed that the company is not
for sale.
   Macmillan and the Robert M. Bass Group are scheduled to square
off Wednesday in a Delaware Chancery Court over whether Macmillan
will be allowed to proceed with a restructuring plan that it
offered earlier this month.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan slipped 25
cents a share to $74.50.
   Macmillan's plan includes paying a special dividend of $52.35 a
share in cash and splitting the company into two parts _ publishing
and information services.
   The plan had been proposed after the Bass group said it wanted
to discuss a takoever of the entire company at $64 a share.
   It subsequently boosted its offer to $73 a share in cash or,
alternatively, a restructuring identical to what Macmillan proposed
except that it included a higher dividend of $58 a share.
   In its statement on Monday, Macmillan said its special committee
felt that the Bass group's plan does not contribute any added value
to the operation of Macmillan ``as they have no experience or
business know-how in the publishing and information fields.''
   Macmillan said its restructuring plan ``will maintain the
tradition of editorial independence and integrity which has served
the public for 145 years and will insure the continued quality of
Macmillan's teaching and information products.''
   The court hearing, which was to be held Monday in Delaware
Chancery Court before Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs, has been
resceduled for 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, a spokesman for the court said.
   Earlier this month Jacobs granted Bass's request for a temporary
injunction blocking the restructuring. At Wednesday's hearing,
Jacobs will hear arguments concerning a preliminary injunction,
which would void the proposed restructuring.

   A special crop production forecast will be
issued in two weeks to reflect the drought that is shriveling corn,
wheat and other harvest prospects in much of the nation, a senior
Agriculture Department official said Monday.
   The special forecast will be issued in USDA's regular crop
report on July 12 and will include new figures adjusted for damage
done by this year's heat and drought, said Assistant Secretary Ewen
M. Wilson, who oversees the department's economic and statistical
services.
   Under normal conditions, the July crop report would include
updated production and yield-per-acre estimates for winter wheat,
which is now being harvested across the nation's midsection.
Similar field estimates for corn, spring wheat, soybeans, cotton
and other fall-harvested crops are not scheduled until August.
   That has not changed. The August crop report will still be the
first big-scale estimate of U.S. crops, Wilson said.
   But the July 12 report will include freshly revised
``projections'' of corn and other fall crops based on the latest
drought and acreage information, he said. The projections now being
used began in May, based on past trends and other assumptions that
no longer apply.
   Wilson, in an interview, disclosed that the 1988-89 projections
based on the trendlines of past years would be wrong and that ``we
would be way off the right numbers'' for this year's harvests.
   ``We're going to move away from that trend-yield estimate and
make some adjustments based on what we know about crop
conditions,'' he said. ``We won't be doing a (field) survey because
it's too early in the season. But we'll do some analysis which will
move us off that trend-line yield in order to reflect the impact of
the drought.''
   Wilson said the special project to come up with better figures
for harvest prospects and anticipated demand through the 1988-89
marketing season was not unique and that USDA had done it before.
   Asked if USDA economists and statisticians weren't sticking
their necks out regarding drought losses, Wilson said, ``I think
we're in a year where, if they put out a trend-line projection,
they would be sticking their necks out even more, because, clearly,
no one believes the trend yield is going to the the actual yield
this year. It's reflecting reality.''
   Earlier this month, when the winter wheat harvest was updated,
the supply-and-demand analysis _ based on the trend lines described
by Wilson _ included projections showing that this fall's corn
harvest would be around 7.3 billion bushels, an increase from 7.06
billion bushels harvested in 1987.
   Soybean production, using the trend-line method, was projected
on June 9 at 1.88 billion bushels, just slightly less than the 1.9
billion bushels produced last year.

<HEAD>Americans Warned of Poisoning Danger From Imported Ceramic Ware</HEAD>

   Americans should be more aware of the
potential of lead poisoning from imported ceramic ware that does
not meet U.S. standards, the head of the Food and Drug
Administration told Congress on Monday.
   Although the agency has stepped up its spot checks in recent
years, FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young acknowledged that it will
never be able to check each shipment. He noted that that it lacks
authority to inspect foreign plants where the products originate.
   Even if the FDA budget was expanded to allow it to make more
spot checks of imports and if the agency was authorized to make
spot checks in foreign plants, Young pointed out that much of the
glazed pottery coming into the United States is purchased abroad by
tourists and military personnel, often from small village
operations.
   Still more, he said, comes in from Mexico ``as either small,
informal entries, as personal belongings of members of the
Mexican-American community living along the border, or as gifts or
individual pieces purchased by U.S. tourists.''
   ``The thousands of trucks and automobiles crossing the border
simply cannot be effectively inspected or their cargos tested for
lead,'' said Young.
   He added that a new program under which the FDA has contracted
with state officials in Colorado and New Mexico to sample Mexican
dinnerware from local retailers has revealed that more than 10
percent of the items sampled have leached excess levels of lead.
   The FDA ordered 20 recalls of ceramic ware in fiscal 1987,
compared with nine in the preceeding five years. Of the 27 recalls,
only one lot was manufactured in the United States.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chaired the hearing of the oversight
and investigations panel of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said there are ``serious deficiencies'' in the FDA's
efforts to control ceramic ware.
   Background material distributed by the committee said the FDA,
for example, has only one inspector to police the entire port of
Houston.
   However, Wyden also acknowledged that a major part of the
hearing he organized was educational.
   ``In view of the widespread lack of knowledge about the nature
and extent of the risks posed by defective ceramicware and
glassware, one of the major purposes of today's hearing is to
inform the public about such risks,'' he said. ``Without adequate
education about this problem, many individuals will continue to
purchase dangerous items for food service.''
   Young said there is ``no way to know whether ceramic ware is
defective by visually inspecting it.''
   ``Consumers thus need to be alerted to this potential hidden
danger,'' he said. ``This hearing should help.''
   Officials say the most risky ceramic dinnerware are poorly fired
pitchers, cups and other vessels. They are especially dangerous
when filled with acidic liquids, such as coffee, orange juice or
wine, which can speed the breakdown of the glazes containing lead.
   Potters have used pulverized lead for years to give a sheen and
rich color to ceramic products. Firing the glaze at high enough
temperatures binds the lead to the surface. But inadequate firing
can result in the glazes degrading over time from use and releasing
microscopic particles of lead.
   One of the main problems is that ceramic items labeled for
decorative use only do not have to pass FDA lead-leach standards,
yet sometimes are used for food preparation or serving.

that unless serious corrosion on its oldest aircraft was fixed
through a stepped-up repair program the planes might become unsafe,
documents show.
   Nevertheless, according to documents released Monday, Aloha in
early March canceled plans for the speedier maintenance schedule,
less than seven weeks before one of its aging Boeing 737s broke
apart during flight on April 18.
   The documents were released by the National Transportation

the plane wary and may be damaging for its manufacturer, some
airline analysts say.
   Sunday's crash of the ultra-modern Air France jet could inflict
``psychological'' damage on the highly touted A320 and prompt
cancelled orders and lost sales. The incident also focuses
attention on the trend toward more technology and fewer pilots,
analysts said Monday.

   The Senate stood firm on requiring companies
to give employees advance notice of large-scale layoffs Monday,
refusing to drop the provision from a bill calling for prior
warning of plant closings.
   ``This is a blueprint for employers who want to disobey the
plant-closing law itself,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
in urging the Senate to retain the layoff provision.
   ``Employers would simply lay them off, piece by piece, bit by
bit, until there was nothing left,'' he said.
   The Senate voted 63-32 to table, or kill, a proposal to drop the
layoff provision from the larger plant-closings notification bill.
   The proposal to drop the layoffs provision was the major
amendment offered thus far by critics of the bill. After lawmakers
acted on it, however, they became snarled in debate over further
limiting moves and Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., gave up
hope of a final vote Monday.
   Byrd said he still was hoping for a vote Tuesday but, before the
Senate halted work for the night, he took steps to invoke cloture,
or shut off debate, later in the week.
   The move to drop the layoff provision was made by Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan. It would have sharply altered the plant-closings
measure, which until recently was part of the 1,000-page omnibus
trade bill.
   President Reagan vetoed the trade bill May 24, singling out the
plant-closings provision for special criticism. He said it would
hamstring managers attempting to operate their companies at peak
efficiency.
   The plant-closings measure was deleted from the trade bill and
reconstituted as a separate piece of legislation after the Senate
sustained Reagan's veto.
   The bill would require companies with at least 100 employees to
provide advance notice of layoffs involving at least 50 workers as
well as notification of full-scale plant closings.
   Labor unions have had some form of the plant-closings
legislation on their congressional shopping list for 15 years.
   Critics said the bill was too broad and thus bound to set off
lawsuits and squabbles. They said dropping the layoff provision
represented one way to impose some limits.
   ``A layoff of 50 employees at a 10,000-employee manufacturing
plant would not be a plant closing to most people but it is under
terms of this legislation,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told reporters Monday morning
that he would call the plant-closings measure for a vote in his
chamber on Wednesday.
   He also said he would seek a House vote Wednesday on the
reconstituted trade bill, which has been shorn not only of the
plant-closings provision but of curbs on export of Alaska oil and
refined petroleum products.
