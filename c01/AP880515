   Thor, a 450-pound pet bear who wasn't
wanted in the suburbs, has moved to the country.
   Sunday was the deadline Bloomington officials had given Thor's
owners, Charles and Deborah Crosby, to move the bear from his
backyard home in the Minneapolis suburb. Officials had cited a city
ordinance prohibiting wild animals.
   Thor was moved quietly Friday night to a new home the couple
built on 12 acres outside of city limits, Crosby's mother said
Sunday.
   ``We miss him terribly,'' said Walterine Crosby, who referred to
herself as Thor's ``grandma.''
   The bear's new den is made of earth-banked logs and features a
40-foot by 40-foot cage and a pond near the Crosby's new home. The
nearest neighbors are miles away.
   The Bloomington City Council first tried to banish Thor last
fall after someone called City Hall to report the bear. Officials
ordered the Crosbys to get rid of Thor, but the order was delayed
because the bear was hibernating in a fenced-in den and nobody
wanted to wake him up.
   The Crosbys, who got Thor as a 5-week-old cub from a game farm,
have said the now 3-year-old bear has never hurt anyone, his front
claws have been removed and he's been trained to respond to the
command, ``Don't touch.''

   In a ritual that began nearly 1,000 years
ago, the mayor of Venice renewed the city's links to the sea with
fanfare and festivities.
   Mayor Antonio Casellati, accompanied by other dignitaries, were
in a procession of boats that went from St. Mark's Square to the
port of St. Nicolo del Lido.
   Casellati then blessed a ring and a laurel wreath and cast them
into the sea, repeating the words of the ancient rite: ``As a sign
of eternal dominance, we marry you, oh sea.''
   The ceremony was first performed in 997 when the forces of Doge
Pietro Orseolo II, the chief magistrate of the republic of Venice,
conquered Dalmatia, a province of Croatia. The ritual was then
repeated every year until 1797 when Napoleon canceled the ceremony
after his troops conquered the area.

   Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with
turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, died Friday at
age 78, Tass said.
   Gorshkov was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef Stalin's emphasis on large
surface vessels impractical because of their vulnerability to
rocket attacks.
   In the book ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said the Soviet
navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile-launching
warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors
that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no
strong opponent.''
   Gorshkov was replaced in 1985.

   Czechoslovak police broke up a meeting of
the Charter 77 human rights group after members passed a resolution
backing democratic reform in the Soviet bloc, an emigre source
reported Sunday.
   The group also has called for a probe into the death of a
human-rights activist and into the Czech judiciary, the source said.
   The meeting in a Prague restaurant was attended Saturday by at
least 50 Charter 77 signatories, according to Palach Press, a
London-based newsletter monitoring developments in Czechoslovakia.
It said police raided the restaurant and seized many of those
present.
   All those detained were released later in the day ``after many
hours of interrogation'' about Charter 77 activities, the report
said.
   The Charter 77 resolution praised the creation of two
independent groups in Czechoslovakia in the past month to deal with
the issues of peace, social welfare and trade union rights.
   It also said recent strikes in Poland, creation of the Network
of Free Initiatives in Hungary and the foundation of the Democratic
Union in the Soviet Union ``clearly shows that the need ... for
political and trade union freedoms is being felt ever more acutely
in the Soviet-bloc countries.''
   The Network of Free Initiatives, an umbrella organization, was
formed early this month in Budapest after a petition calling for a
multiparty parliamentary democracy in Hungary was circulated in
April.
   The Democratic Union which was founded in Moscow recently seeks
a new constitution and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from eastern
Europe and areas of the Soviet Union seized in World War II.
   In a recently released document, Charter 77 claimed that
activist Pavel Wonka, who died in a prison at Hradec Kralove on
April 26, suffered mistreatment during a previous 21-month prison
term.
   Wonka was rearrested because he refused to comply with strict
``protective surveillance rules'' and sentenced to another
five-month term, Carter 77 said, and he died five days later.
   The document called for an independent investigation and also an
independent probe of the overall state of the judiciary and prison
systems.

<HEAD>Several Groups Apparently Interested in Buying Heritage USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two groups are planning to bid
against Charlotte sports executive George Shinn to buy Heritage
USA, the theme park of the strapped PTL ministry, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   It was disclosed last week that PTL officials were discussing a
sale of assets to Shinn that would allow the ministry built by Jim
and Tammy Bakker to maintain control of its church activities.
   The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday that some PTL creditors,
doubting Shinn's willingness to provide up-front cash in his bid,
is seeking a group of buyers more to their liking. The group
includes, among others, First City Bank of Minneapolis, the
newspaper reported.
   ``Cash up front is better than promised cash,'' the newspaper
quoted an unidentified source as saying. ``They think they can put
together a better package.''
   Also, a new Salt Lake City corporation, Tango Trading Co., whose
principals include former PTL Vice President Dale Hill, has
announced it will bid for Heritage USA.
   PTL spokesman David West said Saturday that ministry officials
have talked with a Tulsa, Okla., group of ``Christian people with
resources'' interested in refinancing PTL so it won't have to sell
Heritage USA. West wouldn't name members of the group.
   In U.S. Bankruptcy Court Monday, PTL will file a plan to spin
off its TV ministry and put the Heritage USA Christian retreat up
for sale to pay debts that could amount to $130 million.
   The Charlotte Observer reported last week that Shinn talked with
ministry officials about taking over the Heritage Grand Hotel, the
theme park and PTL's 1,700 acres of undeveloped land.
   Shinn also might buy the ministry's TV studio, church and
amphitheater and lease them back to a reorganized, tax-exempt
ministry to be called Heritage Ministries, the Observer said.
   The proposal is contingent on York County building a $12 million
sports complex, including a stadium for Shinn's Class AA baseball
team and a training center for his Charlotte Hornets, which join
the National Basketball Association next year. The York County
Council is expected to discuss financing options on Monday.
   Shinn says no price has been mentioned, but PTL officials have
said a buyer would need to pay about $100 million for the
ministry's assets, which have been appraised at about $200 million.

   Police arrested 41 protesters in wheelchairs
Sunday after the protesters blocked traffic and disrupted
activities at a hotel where the American Public Transit Association
was meeting.
   The protest took members of Americans Disabled for Accessible
Public Transport 14 blocks from the Gateway Arch to the Omni
International Hotel.
   There was little disruption of traffic during the procession,
said Police Capt. Clarence Harmon, but once they reached the hotel,
some of the protesters blocked traffic and others entered the hotel.
   Authorities said those inside the hotel blocked stairways and
elevator entrances. All 41 were charged with trespassing, police
said.
   ADAPT has said it wants the transit association to push for the
installation of wheelchair lifts on all public buses in the United
States, rather than invoking federal rules that allow alternative
transportation such as special vans.
   Bill Bolte, a spokesman for ADAPT, said the group planned
further demonstrations to protest treatment of those arrested.

<TEXT>
   At an advertising agency for Shimon
Peres' Labor Party, image-makers showed off a new brochure
picturing a checkered Arab headdress _ a symbol of Palestinan
nationalism _ with a black slash across it.
   On the same day, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the rival
Likud bloc worked a crowd of Jewish settlers in the West Bank,
telling them the Israeli-occupied land was ``thirsty for Jewish
settlements.''
   The campaign for Israel's November general elections is getting
into gear, and the main battleground for the left-of-center Labor
Party and the rightist Likud is the Arab-Israeli conflict, brought
to a boiling point by the Palestinian uprising.
   Both Shamir and Peres have told voters the outcome of the
balloting will be crucial for the survival of the Jewish state.
   Peres, foreign minister in a strange-bedfellows coalition with
Shamir, has warned that Likud's refusal to withdraw from any part
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will cost Israel its
Jewish majority and democratic values.
   Shamir has charged that Labor's willingness to exchange some
land for peace will deliver Israel into the hands of its Arab
enemies.
   ``It's the first time since the 1973 (Middle East) war that the
peace process is a major issue in an election campaign,'' said
political scientist Peter Medding of Hebrew University.
   Pollsters say Labor is in a more difficult spot, noting that
many voters have adopted more hard-line views because they feel
threatened by the violent Arab uprising in which more than 180
Palestinians and two Israelis have died since Dec. 8.
   A survey of 1,200 Jewish voters at the end of March showed Labor
has lost 3 percent to 4 percent to Likud since December, with Labor
now at 35 percent of the vote and Likud at 30 percent, said
pollster Hanoch Smith.
   The rest of the vote is divided among more than a dozen smaller
parties that are potential coalition partners for either Labor or
Likud.
   If elections were held tomorrow, Smith said, the two camps each
would get roughly the same number of seats _ a repeat of the
stalemate in the 1984 elections that forced Labor and Likud into
shared rule.
   Their coalition, always fragile, has all but disintegrated since
the uprising. But neither Labor nor Likud has formally ruled out
joining another mixed government in case of a stalemate.
   Labor's campaign, run under the slogan ``Move with Strength and
Brains,'' is aimed at winning right-of-center voters without
alienating the left.
   As a first step, strategists have softened the Peres peace plan
by assuring voters they will have a final say before concessions
are made to the Palestinians.
   ``We will emphasize the idea that there will be a plebiscite
before any major move, such as returning territory,'' said Ruth
Ofir of the Kesher Barel advertising agency hired by Labor.
   Labor's peace program also contains a list of ``no's,'' such as
``no'' to a Palestinian state, ``no'' to talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, ``no'' to a return to the 1967 borders.
   The new brochure with its crossed-out Arab headdress is meant to
illustrate the point. It also pictures an Israeli soldier guarding
the Jordan River, which Labor says will remain Israel's security
border.
   Political scientist Yitzhak Galnoor of Hebrew University
predicted the strategy would backfire.
   ``They are going to fall between the chairs and lose on both
sides,'' said Galnoor. ``The idea that you can compete with the
hardliners of the Likud proved unsuccessful in the campaigns of
1977, 1981 and 1984.''
   The Likud is thought to be in an easier position because its
stance for holding on to the occupied lands doesn't ask voters to
take any immediate risks.
   Likud parliamentary chairman Chaim Kaufman said his party will
drive home the message that ``we can only negotiate after we break
Arab terrorism, both in the territories and outside.''
   Kaufman acknowledged that the Arab uprising has given a boost to
his party. ``The problem has become much clearer, and people are
now aware of what they are facing,'' he said.
   In the Nov. 1 election, all 120 seats in the Parliament are up
for grabs. Israel's 2.88 million eligible voters select the
legislators indirectly, by voting for a party slate.
   Each party forms a list of candidates in ranked order, and the
number of votes a party receives determines how many of its people
make it into the Knesset.

   The remains of one of three U.S. Marines killed
when their helicopter crashed into the Pacific Ocean have been

   Divers found the remains of Capt. John E. Nisbet Jr., 27, of
Corpus Christi, Texas, Saturday near the crash site in about 30
feet of water, Chief Warrant Officer Eric Carlson said Sunday.
   Five days of searching failed to find the remains of the
co-pilot, 1st Lt. Andrew G. First, 24, of Concord, Mass., and the
crew chief, Cpl. Jeffrey E. Tokarz, 23, of Fountain Valley, Calif.
The Navy and U.S. Coast Guard pulled out of the search effort
Sunday, but the Marine Corps will continue looking for First and
Tokarz, Carlson said.
   The three were aboard a CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter that crashed
Wednesday about a mile from the island of Oahu.
   All major components of the helicopter, based at the Marine
Corps Air Station at Kaneohe, have been found for the investigation
into the cause of the crash, Carlson said.

   Inmates at an overcrowded state prison
held three guards hostage Saturday following a fiery uprising that
left one dormitory gutted and two others damaged, officials said.
One guard and one inmate were injured.
   Eight guards were grabbed by 10 prisoners when the disturbance
began, but five hostages were released unharmed Saturday and the
others were reported in good condition, said officials at the
medium-security Mack Alford Correctional Center.
   The inmates, believed to be armed with crude knives, threatened
to kill their hostages if authorities attempted a rescue, said
Jerry Massie, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
   ``One inmate is keeping it going,'' said prison spokeswoman
Anita Trammell. ``I think the inmates are tired. We have one
leader. I think if it wasn't for the leader, things would have been
closed up.''
   The uprising began late Friday after some inmates accused others
of theft and threatened retaliation, authorities said. A group of
the inmates was being prepared for transfer to a maximum-security
prison when they seized hostages.
   ``They released the (fifth) hostage in return for getting to
talk to two specific negotiators,'' said Massie. He would not
identify the negotiators.
   Officials said the inmates had ``a short list'' of specific
demands, but refused to disclose what they were.
   ``I think their primary concern is for their safety and their
well-being,'' Massie said. ``It's just real non-specific. It's not
like a list of `We want better food or better water.' ''
   ``We're fine. They're feeding us. They're taking care of us,''
one hostage was quoted as saying when inmates permitted him to make
a telephone call.
   The 33-year-old red-brick prison was surrounded by Oklahoma
Highway Patrol tactical teams in camouflage clothing, rifle-toting
corrections department officers and firetrucks that were used to
battle blazes in three buildings.
   Officers carrying teargas launchers donned bullet-proof vests in
a parking lot and huddled around blueprints of the prison. But
officials wouldn't say if that activity signaled any impending
action.
   ``That's what you call contingency planning,'' said patrol
spokesman Lt. Stewart Meyer.
   A spokesman said Gov. Henry Bellmon had no plans to call in the
National Guard to assist the law officers already on hand.
   The inmates started a fire that destroyed the east dormitory at
the Mack Alford Correctional Center, then moved to another
dormitory with their hostages, Massie said.
   ``If we were to rebuild the dormitory that was destroyed similar
to one we have at our Lexington facility, it would cost about $2.5
million,'' Massie said, adding that it was too early to estimate
damage to the other dormitories or other prison areas.
   Smoke was still rising from the roof of the torched dormitory
Saturday; fires in two other dormitories were doused.
   Authorities sealed off a section of the prison that held 82
inmates.
   ``Ten of the 82 are participating in the hostage situation ...
the others just got caught inside,'' said Ms. Trammell. Thirty to
35 of the uninvolved inmates locked themselves in their cells, she
said.
   Trammell said one guard was treated after apparently being hit
on the hand with a rock, and one prisoner suffered a minor stab
wound to the shoulder.
   Officers were preparing to transfer five inmates to the Oklahoma
State Penitentiary in McAlester, about 40 miles away, when the
disturbance began. The five had reportedly threatened other inmates
who allegedly had stolen from them.
   ``Apparently, during that period of time, an officer was taken
hostage,'' Massie said. Other officers then were seized.
   More than 500 inmates were evacuated from the prison's
dormitories and held in a yard behind a fence topped with razor
wire. Many were being transferred to other facilities throughout
the state.
   An offer to transport the inmates involved in the uprising to
the federal prison at El Reno, Okla., apparently was rejected late
Saturday, Ms. Trammell said.
   Family members of some of the hostages gathered at a secluded
area outside the facility in rural southeastern Oklahoma near the
Texas border, 130 miles southeast of Oklahoma City.
   Mack Alford, with 652 inmates, has the sixth-largest prison
population in Oklahoma but has an operational capacity of 492,
Massie said. The prison opened in 1955, he said.

<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Saturday it
appears Michael Dukakis will win the Democratic presidential
nomination, but the party will need the aid of Jesse Jackson and
his supporters to win in November.
   ``A Jesse Jackson who is an impassioned part of the effort to
support Mike Dukakis if Mike wins, and that's the way it looks,
that would be helpful, absolutely,'' Cuomo said at a news
conference following a speech to the World Affairs Council of
Oregon.
   Cuomo stopped short of endorsing Dukakis, although he promised
to come out in favor of the race's front-runner before the
convention.
   ``I have great respect for this process,'' he said. ``I will not
treat this as a make-believe race.''
   At the news conference and during a question-and-answer session
with the audience after his speech, Cuomo said the people who are
supporting Jackson's campaign need to be convinced that Jackson is
not the only politician who shares their concerns.
   He said he met with Jackson for more than an hour Friday in
California to discuss that issue.
   The Democratic Party must assure Jackson supporters ``that Jesse
isn't the only one who is concerned about the drug problem,
concerned about education, concerned about corporations that leave
this country to manufacture in foreign lands using cheap labor.
   ``We have to prove to his constituency that we're concerned
about a deteriorating infrastructure and that we have a way to
raise up funds to deal with it. We're concerned about a society
where rich people have gone from a 70 percent tax down to a 28
percent tax at the same time that you have the largest deficit
known in the history of the nation.''
   During his question-and-answer session with the World Affairs
Council audience, he spent several minutes explaining why he
decided not to seek the presidency. Mainly, he said, he couldn't
run for president and continue as governor of New York.
   Explaining why Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, could find
time to run, Cuomo said, ``In his state, people are baptized
Democrats. He can go out and campaign and his agenda will be taken
care of.''
   ``If I leave (New York) for very long, somebody will steal my
desk,'' he said.
   Later Saturday at a GOP fund-raiser in Seattle, Cuomo taunted
Bush for keeping quiet during the Reagan administration and called
on the vice president to explain his plans for the federal budget.
   Republicans ``would like us to think they have chosen George
Bush so early because they want to speak in one voice. I think it's
because they have nothing to say,'' Cuomo said. ``When the vice
president finally does decide to use that voice I hope he tells us
why he hasn't used that voice for eight years.''

Senate. Its passage was expected to pave the way to the
Legislature's adjournment for the year, originally targeted for
mid-April.
   A conference committee's compromise version of the proposal was
approved by the Senate 17-13, and the House 77-65. That sealed the
success of a shaky coalition of lawmakers who favored more support
for Vermont's farmers and those who favored stronger development
planning.
   ``If ever there was a team effort, this bill was it,'' said Rep.
Stephen Reynes, a Democrat and strong backer of the growth
legislation.
   The growth bill was the Legislature's response to a report
produced by a special Governor's Commission on Vermont's Future,
formed last year and headed by Vermont Law School Dean Douglas
Costle.
   The bill provides $7.5 million in direct subsidies to dairy
farmers for one year, a 50-cent per hundredweight offsetting of a
recent federal milk price support cut of the same size.
   If dairy farmers want relief next year, they must join other
farmers in signing up for an abatement program that will pay most
of their property taxes in exchange for a promise not to sell out
to developers.
   With backers of the growth bill citing sharply rising real
estate prices as another of development's dangers, the Legislature
set aside about a third of this year's surplus, $20 million, for
the Housing and Land Conservation Trust Fund.
   The fund is designed to help provide affordable housing by
enabling tenants to buy their apartment complexes and through other
means; it also is to be used to buy development rights on valuable
open land.
   A third part of the growth bill calls for stronger local,
regional and state planning. Kunin introduced it in her State of
the State address in January by asking that ``may'' be changed to
``shall'' in several passages of state law on planning.
   In the compromise, the planning sections will not take effect
for a year, to give time for bugs to be worked out.

   Indian rebels and government officials
ended six days of talks Saturday without reaching the peace
agreement they had sought for the country's Atlantic coast region.
   Uriel Vanegas, an Indian military leader, said the two sides had
reached ``a gentleman's agreement to continue the conversations
soon.
   ``The hope is in the future,'' he said.
   But Jose Gonzalez, one of the government delegates, blamed the
lack of progress on what he said were the unyielding positions of
Brooklyn Rivera, a leader of Yatama, the organization of Miskito,
Sumo and Rama Indians that met with the government.
   The organization, which claims to have 2,000 guerrillas, is not
allied with the Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella group for most
of the U.S.-backed rebels fighting since 1981 to overthrow the
Sandinista government.
   The Indian group wants to maintain its traditional tribal
boundaries, elect its own officials and preserve its customs.
   During the negotiations, Rivera maintained his positions on
boundaries, autonomy for the Atlantic coast, a permanent cease-fire
and food assistance for 256 Indian communities in the region. Each
side accused the other of refusing to compromise.
   Rivera was quoted by local newspapers Friday as saying the
government was requiring a permanent cease-fire as a condition for
allowing the rebel leaders to visit the coast and called it
blackmail.
   He said the trip was needed to confirm signatures on documents
by some Yatama commanders.
   Steadman Fagoth Muller, another leader in the rebel delegation,
said any agreement with the government must be based on ``a
legitimate, genuine and true autonomy that effectively contemplates
the historic revindications and emancipation of the Indian people.''
   Before the talks began, Rivera said Yatama sought the dialogue
because of a cut in U.S. aid and a hostile attitude by Honduras,
which borders Nicaragua.
   The Atlantic coast Indians began fighting in 1981 after the
leftist government tried to impose authority on the isolated,
traditionally independent, region.

   A great white shark, one of the few known
man-eaters, swam into a commercial fishing net in Southern
California's coastal waters, a television station reported Saturday.
   The 13-foot, 1,500-pound shark was displayed when the vessel
docked Saturday at Terminal Island in the Los Angeles harbor.
   Anthony Tibich, skipper of the Aggressor, had ventured out
Friday on an overnight trip to San Clemente Island in search of
commercially marketable shark, according to a report by KNBC-TV in
Burbank.
   But the skipper was surprised to find tangled in the fishing net
Friday morning the huge type of shark featured in the ``Jaws''
movies attacking surfers and swimmers, the report said.
   Sightings of the great white shark are unusual in Southern
California's warmer coastal waters. San Clemente Island is about 75
miles southwest of Los Angeles.
   Reports of a great white shark sighting on Thursday led Orange
County authorities to evacuate about 2,000 swimmers along a 5{-mile
shore at Newport Beach. The beaches were reopened Friday.

   Divers recovered the remains Saturday of one of
three U.S. Marines aboard a helicopter that crashed in the Pacific
Ocean off the island of Oahu, a Marine Corps spokesman said.
   The remains were taken by helicopter to Tripler Army Medical
Center in Honolulu for identification, according to Chief Warrant
Officer Eric Carlson.
   Divers found the remains around 1 p.m. Saturday near the scene
of the crash, which occurred Wednesday one mile from shore in about
30 feet of water, Carlson said.
   Meanwhile, the search continued for the two other Marines aboard
the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter from the Marine Corps Air Station
at Kaneohe, he said.
   The three Marines have been identified as the pilot, Capt. John
E. Nisbet Jr., 27, of Corpus Christi, Texas; the co-pilot, 1st Lt.
Andrew G. First, 24, of Concord, Mass.; and the crew chief, Cpl.
Jeffrey E. Tokarz, 23, of Fountain Valley, Calif.
   The Marine, Navy and Coast Guard search had located submerged
pieces of the twin-rotor transport helicopter. The cause of the
crash remained under investigation.

   United Rubber Workers union members at
Firestone Inc. plants and offices in six states went on strike
Sunday after negotiators failed to reach a tentative agreement on a
contract settlement.
   ``They did not meet the pattern settlement negotiated with
Goodyear,'' said URW President Milan Stone after the 12:01 a.m.
Sunday deadline. Stone confirmed the strike was under way.
   Stone was referring to a tentative agreement reached by the
URW's international committee with Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. The
union intended for the agreement to serve as a pattern for other
rubber companies.
   Stone said Firestone's latest proposal did not match the pattern
settlement in the areas of pension, cost-of-living increases and
health insurance.
   ``These are the three issues that are very dear to our hearts,
and we will fight to keep those and that's why we're on strike.''
   But Firestone officials had a different view of the proposal.
   ``We are deeply distressed that the union has taken this
action,'' George W. Aucott, Firestone's executive vice president,
said in a statement. ``We believe that our proposal contains a
number of improvements, and in terms of Firestone's position in the
industry, is equal in value and in cost to the URW settlement
proposal.''
   The URW represents about 4,700 workers at Firestone plants in
Noblesville, Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville,
Ark.; and Oklahoma City, Okla.; and offices in Akron.
   Firestone spokesman Jim Strandberg said none of the plants was
scheduled to be operating early Sunday morning.
   Talks resumed late Saturday in a final effort to avert a strike.
But even as the Firestone negotiations continued, the fate of the
pact with Goodyear was riding on the outcome of a vote Sunday by a
1,668-member local in Danville, Va.
   Goodyear's 15,000 URW members rejected the tentative contract by
a 3-1 ratio May 1. Local 831 in Danville was to vote on whether to
reconsider the pact. The vote could be pivotal because the Danville
local has enough members to turn the vote around.
   Six of the 11 Goodyear locals approved the pact, but they do not
represent a majority of the Goodyear membership in the URW. Under
URW bylaws, ratification must be made by a majority of the locals
representing a majority of the membership.
   Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer was in Danville on Friday to
appeal to union leaders. Mercer said he met for more than an hour
with about 15 members of the local's executive board ``to urge them
to talk to their people on the floor and seek ratification.'' He
said the visit and appeal were unique in his experience as chairman.
   ``I felt it (the visit) was necessary to make sure I fulfilled
my obligations. I can't sit here in Akron and keep my fingers
crossed and hope everything goes down all right,'' he said.
   If Danville members approve a second vote, they will cast their
ballots Monday, said Local 831 Vice President Johnny Gauldin. On
May 1, 1,400 members of the Danville local rejected the pact by
nearly a 9-1 ratio.
   If Danville rejects a second vote or turns down the contract
again, the URW will strike Goodyear at noon Tuesday, officials said.
   Goodyear workers at Local 2 in Akron, who approved the pact May
1, are awaiting a vote by members of the Danville local before
holding a strike vote at the plant gates Monday. Local 2 President
Bill Breslin has urged his local's 1,700 members to keep working
even if the other locals strike.

<TEXT>
   An unarmed Trident
missile was launched from a submarine off the California coast
Saturday night, creating a brilliant streak of light visible for
hundreds of miles.
   The 8:50 p.m. launch was seen by residents throughout California
and as far inland as Las Vegas, Nev.
   ``We didn't have any obvious problems,'' said Ray Lucasey,
spokesman at the U.S. Pacific Missile Test Center.
   The target of the missile, which has the capacity of carrying
independently targeted nuclear warheads, was not identified. The
missile test range covers 35,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean.
   ``That's about as specific we can get for security reasons,''
Lucasey said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was forewarned about the
launch so as to clear private and commercial flights from the
launch area, said Dick Tornquist, an FAA duty officer in Los
Angeles.
   An official at the Oakland International Airport tower said a
bright, white streak was reportedly seen about 180 miles south of
San Francisco Bay area.
   Radio stations throughout the state were flooded with calls from
excited observers.
   Motorists pulled off the road in Yolo County 400 miles north of
Los Angeles to watch the aerial display, according to Woodland
Daily Democrat city editor Dave Haerle, who described the sight as
a ``star burst.''
   One witness, Steve Severano of Woodside, Calif., said the
contrail-like display looked copper-white in color, a brilliant
streak that seemed to explode as it crossed the sky in a trail of
vapors. Donna Larosa of Lafayette, Calif., said, ``There was a main
beam, then vapors.''

<HEAD>Sixth Tanker Reported Hit; Fire Doused On World's Largest Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Sunday said its war planes hit a
supertanker in the Persian Gulf, the sixth vessel Iraq has attacked
in two days of raids on Iranian oil shipping.
   Iraq said Sunday that its planes hit a ``very large maritime
target,'' a usual refernce to a supertanker, in a nighttime raid
off Iran.
   An unnamed military spokesman told the official Baghdad Radio
that planes scored ``an accurate and effective hit on the target.''
He gave no other details.
   The claim could not be immediately confirmed.
   The report of the attack came after five tankers, including the
world's largest ship, were set ablaze during a raid on one of
Iran's offshore oil terminals Saturday near Larak Island in the
Strait of Hormuz.
   Gulf-based marine salvage executives on Sunday reported an
unspecified number of crewmen were rescued after the Saturday raid
and said 4 or 5 others were missing and believed dead.
   The executives dismissed as exaggerated previous reports by a
London-based maritime agency that 54 people were missing.
   Dubai-based shipping sources said one of Saturday's victims near
Larak Island, the Spanish tanker Barcelona, was beached by salvage
tugboats and was no longer in danger of sinking. But they said
fires aboard were still blazing at dawn.
   Fires were doused on the 564,739-ton Liberian-flag Seawise
Giant, the largest vessel afloat, and the 152,004-ton Cypriot-flag
Argosy, gulf shipping sources said.
   ``The fires have been extinguished on Seawise Giant and Argosy,
but the two tankers were badly damaged in the air attack,'' said
one shipping agent.
   Also damaged were the British-flagged Burmah Endeavour, the
Cypriot-flagged Argosy and the Iranian tanker Khark, shipping
sources said.
   The Seawise Giant and the 457,841-ton Burmah Endeavour, also one
of the world's five-largest ships, are under charter to Iran as
offshore storage tankers at Larak.
   The 152,004-ton Argosy also is under Iranian charter and the
231,712-ton Khark is government owned.
   The attacks were part of an intensified effort by Baghdad to cut
off the export revenues that Tehran uses to finance the war with
Iraq, now in its eighth year.

   About 125 Sikh men left the Golden Temple
and surrendered to Indian security forces Sunday after police
unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the holy shrine.
   One of the militants who surrendered told reporters that between
40 and 45 Sikhs remained holed up in the temple complex, which has
been under siege by India government forces since Monday.
   The surrender came after the 2,800 police and paramilitary
troops around the shrine fired on the temple for an hour, then
announced a cease-fire at 11 a.m. (1 :30 a.m. EDT).
   Using bullhorns, they urged the militants to give themselves up.
Some militants fired sporadically as the Sikhs walked out of the
besieged temple, but no one was injured in the shooting, police
said.
   Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill said some of those who
surrendered where seen throwing weapons into debris scattered
inside the temple complex before emerging.
   ``Until proof to the contrary, everyone will be treated as a
terrorist or an associate,'' Gill said.
   Security sources, who insisted on anonymity, said that Surjit
Singh Penta, who is wanted in connection with the shooting deaths
of more than 30 people in New Delhi last year, was believed to be
among those who surrendered.
   The United News of India news agency reported that Penta was
hospitalized in critical condition after he apparently took a
cyanide capsule following his surrender. The militants have in the
past taken poison to escape capture.
   At least 30 people, most of them Sikhs, have been killed since
the siege began Monday, when Sikh separatists inside the temple
complex opened fire and wounded five officers of the Central
Reserve Police Force.
   The Golden Temple is the spiritual center of Sikhism and its
holiest shrine.
   Sikhs comprise 2 percent of India's 800 million people, but they
are a majority in Punjab state and are fighting for an independent
Punjab homeland.
   The radicals have killed about 960 people so far this year in
Punjab, compared with 1,030 for all of 1987. The victims include
moderate Sikhs as well as Hindus.

   About 1,200 Soviet troops lumbered
into Kabul in tanks and armored personnel carriers Sunday in the
first troop movement of the retreat from the Afghan war.
   After a daylong ride through guerrilla-infested mountains, the
soldiers in the 300-vehicle convoy were greeted by cheering Afghans
who lined the streets of Kabul, turning the military movement into
a parade. Afghan President Najib was on hand to review the
departing troops.
   The convoy had pulled up stakes in Jalalabad early Sunday and
covered the 88-mile distance to the capital by evening.
   The convoy had pulled up stakes in Jalalabad in eastern
Afghanistan early Sunday and covered the 60-mile distance to the
capital by evening.
   Soviet Col. Alexander Zubrilin told reporters that there had
been no casualties during the trek through among the rough terrain
that is within the reach of U.S.-backed rebels fighting Najib's
communist government.
   Information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a
Reuters news agency pool report. The Associated Press was barred
from covering the event, and Soviet officials said the exclusion
was the result of questions asked by the AP during a previous trip
to Kabul.
   Edmund McWilliams, deputy chief-of-mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Kabul, told The Associated Press by telephone that the rebels
have moved in closer to the capital and stepped up attacks on the
city.
   ``We've had, as you may know, this past week, quite a bit of
rocketing of the city, and we're expecting possibly some more
rocketing tonight,'' McWilliams said. ``It does not appear, though,
at this point that the attacks ... will be affecting the pullout.''
   The Jalalabad convoy was to head north on Monday along the route
that passes through the Salang Tunnel, under the Hindu Kush
mountains, to the border with Soviet Uzbekistan.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan to bolster
Najib's forces, but all must pull back to Soviet territory within
the next nine months to comply with U.N.-mediated peace accords
signed in Geneva last month.
   Half of the troops must leave by Aug. 15 under the agreement.
Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov told reporters Saturday that about one
quarter of the soldiers would be home before President Reagan
visits Moscow on May 29.
   The Communist Party leadership in Moscow headed by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev addressed the departing troops with words of thanks and a
call for the ir help in improving Soviet life once they are back on
native ground.
   ``Days of severe trials lie behind you,'' said the party Central
Committee address, printed on the front page of the party daily
Pravda. ``Your profound faith in the noble cause of assistance to
the friendly people braced you up in those trials. You have
fulfilled the order of your homeland.''
   After stating that those killed in Afghanistan would never be
forgotten, Pravda turned to the soldiers' tasks for the future.
   ``Your energy is needed today for perestroika, for the cause of
renovating socialism, for the protection of its achievements,'' the
address continued. ``The party believes in you and calls you into
the forefront of the drive for revolutionary transformations of
Soviet society.''
   Perestroika, or rebuilding, is Gorbachev's drive to shape the
nation into a more democratic and economically viable society.
   The official Tass news agency announced early Sunday that the
pullout had begun from Jalalabad with the departure of a motorized
rifle regiment.
   Tass also reported that Najib sent a message of thanks to
Gorbachev on Sunday, praising the ``heroic feat'' of the Soviets in
helping defe nd his government.
   In a joint Soviet-Afghan statement carried by Tass, the allied
governments said the ``pivotal issue'' in ending the civil war that
has gripped Afghanistan for a decade would be ensuring an end to
``interference from the outside in the home affairs of the
Afghans.''
   Soviet and Afghan officials have accused the United States and
Pakistan of exacerbating the war by delivering arms to the rebels.
   It was not clear whether other Soviet units also left their
bases on Sunday, or when the first troops would cross the border
into the Soviet Union.
   Soviet troops and tanks moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979.

   A pickup truck traveling in the wrong
direction plowed into a church bus loaded with teen-agers returning
from an amusement park late Saturday, and at least 26 people were
killed in the fiery crash, police said.
   ``I just heard a crash, felt the impact of the car (truck) and
looked up and saw flames,'' said Wayne Cox, 14, whose hair was
singed by the flames.
   ``They spread pretty fast. ... I was pinned. Everything was
pretty wild. I was under a lot of people. That's probably what
saved me from getting burned,'' said Cox, an asthmatic who suffered
smoke inhalation.
   Between 30 and 40 people were injured in the 10:55 p.m. accident
in this northern Kentucky community, police said. Among the injured
was the truck driver, who was in critical condition; at least six
others were also listed in critical condition.
   Trooper Jim Mudd, a state police spokesman, gave the number of
dead as at least 26 and said the final toll could be one or two
more.
   The worst bus accident in U.S. history occurred in Kentucky in
March, 1958, when a school bus plunged into a river, killing 26
students and the bus driver.
   The gutted wreckage, shrouded in a tarp, was brought to the
National Guard armory in Carrollton with the bodies still inside.
Officials spent Sunday morning examining the bodies but did not
immediately remove them from the wreckage. Meanwhile, relatives
were summoned to Carrolton and asked to bring dental records.
   ``This is a horrible task for anyone who cares for human life
... for such a joyous occasion to end in such sad tragedy,'' Mudd
said.
   The only listing of people on board the bus was burned in the
accident, he said, but the number was believed to be 67.
   ``They had tried to escape,'' Carroll County Coroner Jim Dunn
said. ``They were in the hallway trying to escape. Bodies were
piled on top of each other.'' The bodies were burned beyond
recognition, he said, and it would probably take hours for them to
be all removed from the wreckage.
   ``Apparently, the gas tank ruptured, throwing fuel into the
bus,'' Dunn said. He called the accident ``the worse I've ever
seen'' in his nine years as coroner.
   One passenger, Jason Booher, said the bus had refueled shortly
before the accident.
   The bus, from the First Assembly of God Church in Radcliff, was
returning to Hardin County, south of Louisville, from the King's
Island amusement park north of Cincinnati, Ohio, police said.
   The pickup was traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of
Interstate 71 when it collided head-on with the bus, Mudd said.
   A spokeswoman at the church said that the Army provided vans to
carry relatives to the temporary morgue at Carrollton.
   ``We have been asking the families to bring along any dental
records or other medical histories they may have. They've also been
asked to try to remember what the children were wearing,'' said the
spokeswoman, who declined identification.
   Survivors said that after the impact, the front of the bus burst
into flames and the fire spread quickly. Survivors escaped through
the back door and windows, said Cox.
   Booher, 13, said he and another youth helped evacuate the
passengers from the burning bus.
   Booher said he pulled survivors on to the ground outside the
back door while Jamie Hardesty stood just inside the door and
pushed them out.
   ``Jamie, he pushed everyone out,'' Booher said. ``He was up in
the bus and I was out the back door of the bus, helping those who
were hurt.''
   Booher said Jamie played ``a big part. He saved a lot.''
   Many of the parents of the youths gathered at the Radcliff
church early Sunday to await news.
   ``We're praying for each other and we're trusting the Lord,''
said Vicki Fischel, a parent of a teen-ager on the bus.
   Some of the injured were taken to Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville and Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville. Others
were taken to Carroll County Memorial Hospital in Carrollton and
Tri-Counties Hospital in LaGrange.
   Humana nursing supervisor Kelly Moriarty said the injured were
being treated for severe burns and multiple injuries.
   Among those being treated at Humana was the truck driver, Larry
W. Mahoney, 34, of Worthville in Carroll County, Mudd said. Mudd
said Mahoney was in critical condition.
   About 24 youths initially were taken to Carroll County Memorial
Hospital, said Dr. Jeff Campbell, the emergency room physician.
Campbell said doctors in the small, 54-bed hospital had to treat
the teen-agers in the emergency room, the recovery room and the
cafeteria.
   Dr. Donald Thomas, chairman of emergency medicine at Humana
Hospital, said most of the injured were suffering from burns and
appeared to be youngsters between 15 and 16 years old.

<HEAD>Economists Believe Fed Ready to Push Interest Rates Up Further</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, which ratcheted interest
rates up a notch last week, is standing ready to tighten further if
inflation shows signs of getting out of control, economists believe.
   The central bank's credit tightening moves have already prompted
the first increase in the prime rate in seven months and economists
said they look for a variety of interest rates, including mortgage
rates, to head higher in the weeks ahead.
   Fed policy-makers will meet behind closed doors Tuesday to
review current monetary policy. Economists said this session of the
Federal Open Market Committee has already been overshadowed by the
move the central bank took last week to boost interest rates.
   While the Fed, as usual, made no public announcement of the
action, the closely watched federal funds rate moved up one-fourth
of a percentage point to 7[ percent last week. This rate, which is
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, is the
most sensitive to moves by the central bank to make cash more or
less readily available to the banking system.
   Major banks followed suit, announcing Wednesday a boost in their
prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the first
increase in this benchmark lending rate since the stock market
crash jolted Wall Street.
   The prime rate is used to calculate loans to businesses as well
as to determine many types of consumer loans, including the popular
home equity loans.
   The credit tightening by the Fed followed a report that the
unemployment rate had fallen to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in
April. It was the second move by the central bank in less than two
months to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of dampening
economic activity to prevent a surge in inflation.
   The Fed had also been tightening credit right before the October
stock market crash but switched quickly to an easier-money policy
to keep the country from slipping into a recession.
   But reports so far this year indicate that the economy suffered
few ill effects from the crash. The overall economy grew at a
surprisingly robust 2.3 percent annual rate from January through
March.
   Many analysts believe the current jobless level means the
country is nearing the range of full employment when tight labor
markets can start pushing up wages.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said he
believes a variety of signs shows the country is on the brink of a
round of higher inflation in which ``too many dollars are chasing
too few goods.''
   ``We have a strong economy pressing against capacity in both the
labor and production markets,'' he said. ``But it is early in the
process, which suggests that there is perhaps still time for the
Fed to nip it in the bud.''
   Other economists are not so sure that inflationary pressures
have begun to build. They note that wage demands have still
remained moderate and industry is operating at 82.3 percent of
capacity, still below the 85 percent range thought to trigger
inflation problems.
   But analysts generally agreed that interest rates are headed
higher, pushed up not only by credit tightening by the central bank
but concern among banks and financial market investors that they
need to demand a higher premium as a hedge against inflation.
   Mortgage rates have been rising in recent weeks and now stand at
10.4 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage, up from 9.82
percent just two months ago.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., predicted
that mortgage rates would hit 10.75 percent by mid-summer.
   ``Inflation is accelerating,'' he said. ``No one knows for sure
where full employment is, but almost everybody would agree that 5.4
percent is getting close.''
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
expected the central bank would like to keep policy unchanged to
avoid drawing attention to its actions during a presidential
campaign. But he said renewed pressure on the dollar would force
the central bank to tighten further.
   The Fed tightened slightly a month ago when an unexpectedly high
U.S. trade deficit sent the dollar tumbling on foreign currency
markets. The government is due to report the March trade report on
Tuesday.
   ``If a bad trade report sends the dollar down, the Fed would
have to send another signal to the markets that it will defend the
U.S. currency,'' Evans said.

<HEAD>Legacies From Elderly Women Enrich British Animal Charities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The monkeys at Paignton Zoological and Botanical
Gardens are soon to get new, improved housing, thanks to a $750,000
bequest from a woman who loved their company.
   For decades, elderly women have been leaving their fortunes to
animal charities like the Cats Protection League, the Donkey
Sanctuary or zoos like Paignton in southwest England.
   This week the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals received the largest gift in its 164-year history _ $5.15
million from an 80-year-old widow who lived with her cat, Pussy.
Even in a nation of pet owners, charities say, such women shine.
   Feeling alone in the world except for their pets, elderly women
are the lifeblood of Britain's multimillion-dollar animal charities.
   ``Animal charities are on the crest of a demographic boom,''
says Jonathan Clark, appeals officer for 91-year-old pet charity
Blue Cross, which in 1986 received more than half its $4.65 million
of income from bequests.
   ``Most of our supporters are of a generation whose husbands, or
potential husbands, went off to two world wars and never came back.
The last thing in their lives was a cat or a dog, and they've got
no one to leave (everything) to,'' he said.
   Women usually live longer than men, says Paul Wright, legacy
officer for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, founded in
1917 to treat poor peoples' pets. ``Very often they are simply left
with an animal.''
   Often, the only condition is that the charity care for their
cat, dog, even chicken. The RSPCA has received 20 cats this year,
and the dispensary was left money to subsidize a tortoise in what
Wright chuckles will be a ``long-term arrangement,'' given their
lifespans.
   The most spectacular bequests usually fall to the RSPCA,
Britain's 10th largest charity and the country's largest
animals-only cause. Last year, it depended on posthumous gifts for
nearly 70 percent of its $34.2 million income.
   ``Without that source, we wouldn't be able to function,'' said
spokeswoman Amanda Aviss.
   In 1985, its second-largest windfall came from an elderly woman
who gave $2.45 million, provided it was spent on the society's 240
inspectors who investigate cases of cruelty.
   Dorothy Walker's bequest to the RSPCA was unconditional and did
not even mention Pussy, whom the society is resettling.
   ``She often said she preferred animals to people, and she was
determined to prove it to the last,'' London's Today newspaper
quoted Mrs. Walker's former housekeeper as saying.
   Ivy Warr, an elderly woman who said she was Mrs. Walker's
sister, said she was ``shocked and disgusted'' by the will but
couldn't afford to contest.
   With large bequests, ``you'll often find relatives pop up and
try to get the money,'' acknowledges Ms. Aviss, saying the society
can only ``abide by the law.''
   But most benefactors don't hate people, charities say.
   Clark says he sometimes receives a letter saying, ``I've lost
faith in human nature. All my money can go to the animals.''
   Many elderly women have ample estates because the value of their
house has skyrocketed over the years, charities say.
   Some charities worry about depending on bequest. While human
causes also depend on them, most have far fewer bequests in
proportion to their total income.
   ``You need good live donators,'' says Elizabeth Svendsen, whose
Donkey Sanctuary depends on legacies for more than half its
voluntary income.
   ``I love the legacies, but I think it's a healthy sign to have
other donors,'' she says.
   Still, some animal lovers bypass charities, leaving money to
their own animals or to those they call their own.
   Marie Lefevre, an 84-year-old widow who died two years ago, left
$754,000 to the apes she visited regularly for 20 years at Paignton.
   Mary Rosevear, a zoo official, said the money is expected this
fall and will be used to build new ape houses and refurbish others.
``She spelled out what she wanted,'' said Mrs. Rosevear.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Seizures: Interdiction or Overkill?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government calls it ``zero tolerance,''
but industry and civil liberties groups have begun to question
whether ``overkill'' isn't an equally accurate description of the
policy under which luxury yachts and other private property is
being seized in the battle against drugs.
   In the latest episode, the U.S. Coast Guard confiscated on
Saturay the yacht Monkey Business, the charter vessel that once
ferried presidential contender Gary Hart and model Donna Rice to
the Bahamas, after officers said they found 1 gram _ or one
twenty-eighth of an ounce _ of marijuana aboard.
   Only days earlier, the Coast Guard seized the $2.5 million
yacht, Ark Royal, on grounds that one-tenth of an ounce of
marijuana was aboard. No one was arrested in either case.
   Even rental cars and leased boats and trucks are being seized by
U.S. Customs Service agents and the Coast Guard, triggering
complaints from owners who argue that they shouldn't be penalized
for the acts of their customers.
   Richard Schwartz, president of the Boat Owners Association of
the United States, personally protested to the commandant of the
Coast Guard that the seizure of the $2.5 million yacht Ark Royal
was ``overkill.''
   The association, which has 265,000 members, estimates that there
are 15 million boat owners across the country.
   ``We're concerned about the drug problem in America, but there
has to be a rule of reasonableness here,'' Michael Sciulla, the
association's vice president, said Friday.
   In the case of the Ark Royal, ``the owner of the boat was not on
board, no one was arrested as far as we can tell, there were no
large amounts of drugs found on the boat,'' Sciulla said. ``It just
doesn't seem fair that the absent owner would face forfeiture on
those grounds.''
   Three days after the controversial yacht seizure, the Coast
Guard released the Ark Royal when the Irvine, Calif., owner of the
133-foot yacht paid a $1,000 fine and $600 in seizure fees. Some
marijuana seeds and two stems had been found in a dresser drawer
and a trash can aboard the boat.
   ``This type of action presents an unreasonable danger to all
boat owners for the isolated actions of passengers and crew,'' said
Michael Rogerson, president of Tomima Corp., the Ark Royal's owner.
   The government shows no signs of backing away from its new
policy. Last week, the Coast Guard seized another yacht off the
Florida coast after a search turned up a dollar bill with traces of
cocaine and a bag with marijuana residue. It also seized a 55-foot
fishing boat off San Diego after finding less than an ounce of
marijuana and a small amount of what appeared to be methamphetamine.
   Since April 11, the Coast Guard has confiscated 27 boats under
the ``Zero Tolerance'' campaign. The Customs Service is stepping up
its program, and since March 21, agents have seized 700 vehicles
containing drugs.
   ``They are not deterring bad guys, but they are punishing the
innocent guy'' with a program in which a number of rental vehicles
are being seized and held for lengthy periods, said Alan Kay,
outside general counsel to the the American Car Rental Association.
   ``One of the problems with seizure is that under any
circumstances it takes sometimes eight or nine months for the
return of the vehicle'' to a rental agency, which pays storage
costs to get it back, Kay said.
   Mary Coombs, a Miami representative of the American Civil
Liberties Union, agrees that it is excessive ``to take somebody's
property from them for something they probably couldn't control.
... It's putting people at enormous risk with no very effective way
of protecting themselves.''
   The term ``zero tolerance'' originated last year when U.S.
Attorney Peter Nunez of San Diego, Calif., and U.S. Customs Service
agents began arresting motorists carrying even tiny amounts of
drugs across the border. The Customs agents and Nunez were
embarking on an effort that has become a model for the federal
government's current war on drug users.
   Under the San Diego operation, an average of 15 people a week
are charged with drug possession, many of whom are first-time
offenders who wind up on probation for one year.
   ``I encourage federal prosecutors nationwide to emulate the
program in San Diego with all available prosecution resources,''
Attorney General Edwin Meese III said in a March 30 memo to all
U.S. attorneys.
   Meese noted that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 includes a
$1,000 mandatory minimum fine for possession and that federal civil
asset forfeiture provisions permit law enforcement officers to
confiscate any vehicle carrying drugs, even in trace amounts.
   ``When used judiciously,'' Meese said in the memo, ``these
sanctions send present and potential users a clear signal about the
unacceptability of drug use.''
   ``The Reagan administration's view is that possession is a very
serious thing and that it's the possession of the drug which needs
to be dealt with if we're ever going to address with the drug
problem in a serious way,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry
Eastland. ``What puts bite into our entire user prosecution
initiative is this forfeiture aspect.''
   Drug traffickers frequently are the target of asset forfeiture
proceedings, while users seldom have been. But under federal law on
civil asset forfeiture, there is no distinction between the
property of drug users and drug traffickers. Forfeiture does not
depend on the quantity of drugs involved. Nor is it a legal defense
under the forfeiture law to claim that the contraband was intended
for personal use rather than commercial trafficking.
   Meese noted in his March 30 memo that ``our primary narcotics
enforcement focus at the federal level has been and will continue
to be on supply reduction.''
   But ``it is becoming increasingly apparent that a more
consistent enforcement presence on the demand side is vital to the
success of our national anti-drug program,'' Meese said in the memo.

   One week after voters swept Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand to a second seven-year term, they face yet more
campaign pledges, political decisions, and two new rounds of voting.
   Mitterrand's announcement Saturday that he had decided to
dissolve the 577-seat National Assembly and hold elections June 5
and June 12 set off a flurry of justifications, denunciations, and
scrambling for unity among conservative parties.
   Socialist leaders called the move inevitable. To conservatives,
it was proof that Mitterrand had bamboozled voters with campaign
vows to form a center-left government of national unity.
   ``Mr. Francois Mitterrand has just demonstrated that the
position he himself had defined on this subject during the
presidential campaign ... was only aimed at putting the French
people to sleep,'' said Jean-Claude Gaudin. He leads the outgoing
Assembly contingent of the center-right Union for French Democracy,
one of two leading rightist parties that hope to defeat the
Socialists in the upcoming elections.
   After campaigning on the theme of national unity and pledging to
try to work with the existing Assembly and its three-seat
center-right majority, Mitterrand changed his mind. He said he
would seek a new Assembly to try to win a majority of his own.
   The outgoing Assembly was controlled by former Premier Jacques
Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic party and the Union
for French Democracy. Mitterrand won 54 percent of the vote in the
May 8 presidential runoff against Chirac.
   The president named Michel Rocard, a popular Socialist with wide
appeal to the center of the political spectrum, as his new premier.
But Rocard was unable to find more than token non-Socialist
representation for his government.
   ``Mr. Mitterrand ceded to double pressure, that of the Socialist
Party which dreams of regaining an absolute majority in the
National Assembly, and that of Michel Rocard who did not have the
courage to present himself before Parliament,'' said Gaudin.
   In his nationally televised address Saturday night, the
president said the opening to the center he had sought ``could not
be brought about to the extent I wished. Therefore, it was my duty
to draw the appropriate conclusions.''
   Pierre Mehaignerie, a centrist political leader who represented
a key to any alliance with the Socialists, said he was firmly
opposed to a governing agreement with the Socialists, but he also
opposed the dissolution.
   The centrists had said they would not automatically submit a
censure motion against a Rocard government but would instead judge
each Socialist bill on its merits.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right National Front,
called the new elections a Socialist ``ambush.'' Le Pen, who scored
a surprisingly high 14 percent in the first round of the
presidential election, proposed a ``united front against the
hegemony of the Socialist Party.''
   However, Jacques Toubon, secretary-general of the Rally for the
Republic, rejected that idea. He called for his party to join the
Union for French Democracy and present single candidates in each
district to strengthen their possibilities.
   The official campaign for the first round of voting opens May 22
and closes June 3.
   According to an opinion poll published Sunday in the Journal du
Dimanche, Socialists would win 41 percent of the vote, 24 percent
would go to the Rally and 15 percent to the Union. The rest would
go to minor parties.

<HEAD>Airline Demands Taiwan Punish Hijackers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese airline official demanded that Taiwan
severely punish two men who were granted political asylum after
they hijacked a Chinese jet to Taiwan, an official report said
Sunday.
   However, Wu Rongnan, director general of Xiamen Aviation Co.,
which operated the plane, did not comment on Taiwan's refusal to
return the hijackers to China as Communist authorities had
requested.
   The two men, former air force radar operators, hijacked a Boeing
737 with 118 people on board Thursday night and forced it to fly to
Taiwan, threatening the crew with what later turned out to be a toy
gun and fake explosives.
   Taiwan, governed since 1949 by the anti-communist Nationalist
Party, returned the plane, crew and other passengers within hours.
   It gave the hijackers asylum, but the Taiwan military has
recommended they be prosecuted for endangering flight safety.
   The People's Daily on Sunday quoted Wu as telling a news
conference in coastal Xiamen, where the hijacked flight originated,
that the hijackers' use of force warranted severe punishment.
   ``Without regard to the safety of the ... Chinese and foreign
passengers, the two hijackers used force to threaten the plane's
crew and passengers and caused the plane to exceed its speed limit,
triggering violent shaking of the plane body,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
   ``In order to protect the safety of the plane and passengers,
the pilot had no choice but to fly as the hijackers directed,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   Accounts in China's official media have said the hijackers,
Zhang Qingguo, 27, and Long Guiyun, 26, covered the heads of
several crew members with plastic bags and wrapped two stewardesses
in cotton curtains to stop them from signaling for help.
   The pilot, Yang Yongling, said the hijackers told him they had
guns and knives.
   The People's Daily said ``in view of the hijackers' violent
actions, Wu demanded the Taiwanese side severely punish the two
hijackers according to aviation practice.''
   Taiwan military officials have refused comment on whether Zhang
and Long will be charged with hijacking.
   If charged and convicted of the lesser crime of endangering
flight safety, they could receive a maximum of seven years in jail.
However, the presiding judge of the court in Taiwan's capital,
Taipei, said the hijackers could expect leniency.
   Taiwan officials are torn between their desire to avoid
appearing to encourage hijacking and their sympathy for the
hijackers' motives. Zhang said they acted because they ``detested
the brutality of Communism.''
   While the hijacking was in progress, the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, parent company of the Xiamen Aviation Co.,
asked Taiwan to return the hijackers. China has not repeated this
request or commented on Taiwan's refusal to comply.
   In 1986, when the pilot of a Taiwan airliner diverted his plane
to Canton and defected to China, mainland officials returned the
plane and crew but not the pilot, and did not charge him.
   That incident led to the first direct talks between mainland and
Taiwan officials since 1949.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines jet bound for Tokyo made an
emergency landing 450 miles from Japan's capital Sunday after
running short of fuel over the Pacific Ocean, authorities said.
   A Transport Ministry official at Tokyo International Airport at
Narita, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Northwest's
Flight 7, a Boeing 747 with 379 passengers and 21 crew members,
reported a fuel shortage over the ocean and landed at Chitose, a
city on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.
   He said the jetliner ran low on fuel because it was flying from
Seattle to Tokyo against strong winds.
   The official said he did not know how much fuel was left when
the plane landed at Chitose.
   After refueling, the plane landed at New Tokyo International
Airport at Narita at 4:50 p.m., about two hours late.
   A Northwest Airlines official confirmed the incident but
declined to discuss the matter.
   On May 2, a United Airlines Boeing 747 en route from Los Angeles
to Tokyo with 258 people on board landed safely at Narita on one
engine after two of its engines failed over the Pacific and a third
failed as it approached the airport.

   Just two years ago, the Congressional Budget
Office's economic forecasts ruled Capitol Hill, and its decisions
could force the president to cut billions of dollars in federal
spending.
   But the Congress has stripped the office of important powers,
left it without a permanent director for more than a year, and
exposed the officially non-partisan agency to charges of political
tampering.
   ``CBO is disintegrating,'' said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Congress set up its own budget office a dozen years ago to
counter the power of the president's Office of Management and
Budget. In the following decade, the agency established a
reputation for non-biased and unvarnished assessments of the
federal budget and its workings in the economy.
   In December 1985, its power peaked with passage of the emergency
deficit reduction amendment known as Gramm-Rudman. The CBO was
charged with making deficit estimates that, once averaged with
White House figures, launched automatic spending cuts across the
government.
   In 1986, however, the Supreme Court found the law defective. In
rewriting the statute, Congress relegated the CBO to advisory
status.
   A House-Senate search committee, meantime, was unable to agree
on a replacement for CBO Director Rudolph G. Penner, whose
three-year term was expiring at year's end. Penner stayed on until
March 1987.
   The two sides appear farther apart than ever over choosing a
successor. Although there are many qualified candidates, each
chamber is fighting for its own choice.
   ``Personal honor is at stake,'' said one House aide involved in
the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., who is expected to take over the
budget committee next year, said he was concerned Congress was
ceding back to the executive branch the economic decision-making
prowess it has fought to gain.
   ``I think Congress has to be very concerned when it begins to
lose what has been an objective eye in dealing with budget
issues,'' he said. Without an officially-appointed leader to carry
the flag, the agency is ``an easier target for those who don't like
CBO's opinions,'' he said.
   The agency is already embroiled in a dispute between House
Republicans and Democrats over a bill raising the federal minimum
wage and it has been criticized by both sides.
   The Democratic-controlled House Education and Labor Committee
asked the CBO for an official estimate of the bill's cost to the
federal and local governments. Republicans opponents, meanwhile,
requested a broader assessment including effects on the nation's
economy.
   The CBO at first answered both requests in its report to the
committee. But the Democrats ordered the CBO to delete the
nationwide assessment, which concluded that 500,000 jobs would be
lost.
   Republicans charged partisan tampering, while the Democrats
accused the CBO of failing to follow strictly the committee request.
   ``We were being used as a pawn to fight the minimum wage
legislation,'' said Jim Blum, the acting director of the agency.
``I am very much concerned about what appears to be a growing
perception that we're losing our non-partisanship.''
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, senior Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, said he was beginning to become concerned
also. He has suggested that Blum, interim director since the
beginning of this year, be made the permanent director.
   ``There must be a leader at CBO to maintain its credibility,''
agreed Gray. But the House leadership has favored other candidates.
   With neither chamber giving ground in whose prerogative it is to
choose the director, some of those involved expect the decision
will be postponed until next year. Both the House and Senate will
have new budget committee chairman then, but Panetta, the future
House chairman, said waiting could hurt.
   ``Every day that we don't have a director there (at CBO) makes
it that much tougher for whoever's appointed to restore its
credibility,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reforms Approved After Government Survives Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament on Sunday approved
economic reforms to freeze wages and open Yugoslavia to world
markets a day after the country's two most Westernized republics
tried to topple the government.
   Both chambers of parliament backed the reforms, which Premier
Branko Mikulic worked out with the International Monetary Fund.
   Mikulic outlined the economic reforms in general terms on
Saturday, when he survived calls for his government's ouster from
Slovenia and Croatia. Yugoslavia will curb its import restrictions,
open itself to world markets and give its National Bank a stronger
monetary role, he said.
   Mikulic also talked of allowing citizens to buy stock in firms
and of increasing the role of profit in production.
   He said the new measures would be harsh but warned that more
drastic reductions in real wages lay ahead if inflation exceeded
the 90 percent target. Yugoslavia's current inflation rate is 170
percent, and it has a foreign debt of $20 billion.
   Slovenia and Croatia, the most advanced of Yugoslavia's six
republics, blame Mikulic's government for the nation's economic
crisis and urged a vote of no-confidence in the government.
Parliament on Saturday decided against voting on the motion.
   During Saturday's discussion, closed to the public but reported
in detail by the state-run media, even Mikulic's supporters noted
the government had failed to master the economic crisis.
   The government's failure has eroded support for the Communist
Party, which has governed this nation since World War II.
   Serbian intellectuals and Slovenians have even begun calling
openly for a multi-party Western democracy.
   Mikulic blamed what he termed ``the antiquity, lack of
flexibility and inefficiency'' of the current economic system for
the crisis but rejected any immediate need for political reform.
   Yugoslavia's six constituent republics and two autonomous
provinces are currently battling over how to reform the country's
awkward 1974 constitution, bequeathed by the late Josip Broz Tito
in what he said was an attempt to avoid ethnic conflict.
   Mikulic said Saturday he wanted the constitutional reform pushed
through by early fall.
   The constitution has proved unworkable because of its
requirement that each republic and province approve all key
political decisions and because of its mandatory annual rotation of
all state and Communist Party offices.
   The ritual of rotating the presidency took place on Sunday, with
former Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic, a Bosnian, taking over
from Lazar Mojsov, a Macedonian.
   Yugoslavia is hoping to get $2 billion of debt payments
rescheduled and to receive another $1.4 billion from the IMF later
this month.
   Agreement with the IMF had been expected last week, but the fund
apparently delayed approval pending this weekend's confidence vote
on the Mikulic government.
   Yugoslavia is also expected to secure $300 million in bridging
loans needed to stave off bankruptcy before the IMF accord takes
effect.
   Failure to secure the emergency loans last week led Mikulic's
government to delay the lifting of a six-month wage and price
freeze imposed last November.
   Yugoslavs have been on a mass shopping spree in anticipation
that prices will jump sharply higher after lifting of the ban,
which only partially limited inflation.
   Living standards, which have already fallen by one-third since
1980, are expected to drop further, making strikes and social
unrest likely.
   The gap between the poor south and richer north of Yugoslavia is
also likely to increase, provoking more calls from wealthy Slovenia
and Croatia for a market-oriented economy with closer ties to
Western Europe.

   Government scientists will take to the sea and
air in July to measure the chemicals contributing to acid rain off
the mid-Atlantic coast.
   A research ship and aircraft will study chemicals in the air and
water between Norfolk, Va., and Bermuda, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration announced.
   Dr. Joe Boatman of the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory in Boulder,
Colo., said that the scientists will measure concentrations of
sulfur, nitrogen and other chemicals in an effort to track
pollution as it travels off the coast.
   Acidic rain, believed to result from the chemical reaction
between water in the air and chemical pollution from factories, has
been blamed for environmental damage in the Northeast and Canada,
among other areas.
   In addition, the Environmental Defense Fund recently charged
that this acid precipitation could be partly to blame for declines
in marine life in coastal areas including the Chesapeake and
Delaware bays and Long Island and Pamlico sounds.
   Boatman said the NOAA ship Mt. Mitchell and an agency aircraft
will make several trips between Bermuda and the East Coast to
measure the chemicals, determine their direction of travel and
predict how much reaches Bermuda and beyond.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 27 right-wing
extremists who held an illegal rally, gave the Nazi salute and
shouted Nazi slogans, officials said Sunday.
   The arrests occurred Saturday night at a square in Munich after
police briefly took into custody Michael Kuehnen, a 32-year-old
neo-Nazi leader.
   Kuehnen had been scheduled to speak at a meeting of the Bavarian
branch of the far-right Free Workers' Party in nearby Siegertsbrunn.
   Police said they feared Kuehnen could instigate violence if he
were allowed to speak at the meeting, which about 30 people
attended. He was released after the meeting was over.
   Right-wing extremists tried to hold a demonstration in front of
Munich's main police station to protest Kuehnen's detention but
were ordered to leave because they had no permit, police said.
   Twenty-seven of the protesters then went to a street corner and
began shouting Nazi slogans and giving the stiff-armed Nazi salute
before police arrived, officials said.
   Police said all but one of the demonstrators were released.
Police did not say whether that demonstrator, an 18-year-old
Austrian, would face charges.
   Estimates of the number of right-wing extremists in West Germany
range from 22,000 to more than 23,000.

   An anti-government protester stabbed
himself in the stomach Sunday and jumped off a three-story building
in front of hundreds of other demonstrators.
   Cho Sung-man, 24, was declared dead about three hours after he
was taken to nearby Paik Hospital, the MBC radio-television network
reported. Doctors refused comment.
   Hospital sources said Cho fell face first to the ground from the
top of an annex to the Myongdong Cathedral, South Korea's Roman
Catholic headquarters.
   Friends carried Cho, a student from Seoul National University,
out of the cathedral compound, where about 300 students and family
members of political prisoners were staging a sit-in to push for
the release of dissidents.
   Cho also had shouted slogans against the government of President
Roh Tae-woo, who took office in February. Suicide is a form of
political protest in South Korea.
   The incident momentarily brought silence to the cathedral
compound, then the protesters shouted more anti-government slogans.
Riot police stood by several blocks away, but no clashes were
reported.
   Hundreds of students shouting ``Down with the Roh regime!''
demonstrated in down Seoul on Saturday night after violent clashes
at a university campus between riot police and about 10,000
students from 70 universities nationwide.
   The demonstrators Saturday and Sunday also called for resumption
of unification talks with communist North Korea and urged the
government to give North Korea a role in staging the Olympics this
fall.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics after South Korea
rejected its demand to be made a co-host.
   After the opposition stripped Roh's party of its parliamentary
majority in recent elections, students have been attempting to make
the Olympics a major political issue.
   They also have called for an end to U.S. influence. About 4,100
U.S. troops are stationed here under a mutual defense treaty.
   South Korea's 140,000-member national police were on top alert
as students planned to mount a major anti-government demonstration
on the anniversary of the 1980 civilian revolt in the southern city
of Kwangju.
   By official count, 191 people were killed in the Kwangju
uprising, which began on May 18. The opposition says the death toll
was much higher and has demanded a full investigation.

   The government declared a state of
emergency in the war-torn northern provinces of Eritrea and Tigre
and ordered border areas evacuated, government radio reported
Sunday.
   Western diplomats said the action raised fears that President
Mengistu Haile Mariam's communist government will use harsh tactics
to suppress Marxist separatists in the north, where the war has
made it difficult to get relief supplies to 3.2 million drought
victims.
   Addis Ababa Radio said the decree, issued Saturday, gave
security forces and administrators sweeping powers to fight the
Eritrean and Tigrean rebels in this East African nation.
   It said people and their property will be evacuated within 15
days from 6-mile-wide strips along Ethiopia's 1,500-mile border
with Sudan and along the 600-mile Red Sea coastline, excluding the
Eritrean port of Massawa.
   The report did not indicate how many people would be affected,
but the areas are sparsely populated.
   The decree, issued by the Council of State and signed by
Mengistu, establishes military and security councils to direct all
military and civilian activities and empowers them to transfer or
expel people and sequester private property for public service.
   Western diplomats said they were particularly concerned about a
section of the decree giving the councils power to declare any area
prohibited.
   ``It smacks of free-fire zones. ... Presumably the intention is
to say you get out of the area and if not, you're dead meat,'' said
one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Reagan said last month that ``starvation and scorched
earth are being considered as weapons to defeat the rebellion.''
   Rebels of the secessionist Eritrean People's Liberation Front
have been fighting for 27 years in Africa's oldest civil war, and
guerrillas of the Tigre People's Liberation Front took up arms 14
years ago to demand more autonomy. They have won major victories
this year and captured several towns since February.
   Mengistu on March 31 said his government is starting a huge
counteroffensive. In his first acknowledgment of the war, Mengistu
said his troops were fighting a ``grim struggle'' against rebels in
the country's northernmost provinces.
   A week later, his government expelled from Eritrea and Tigre
about 60 foreign relief workers, citing ``personnel risks.''
   The action has crippled a massive Western relief operation.
Government officials have said indigenous organizations will
continue relief efforts, but insist that military objectives must
take priority over humanitarian needs.
   In Congress last month, Chester Crocker, U.S. assistant
secretary of state, accused Mengistu of banning relief workers to
hide the fighting.
   ``He doesn't want anyone to see what's going on up there,
because it's going to be bloody,'' Crocker told the Africa and
human rights subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies in 1974 when, with a clique
of fellow army officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie.

   Sinhalese extremists Sunday shot and
killed five people in a raid on the home of an official in
President Junius R. Jayewardene's governing United National Party.
   Military officers, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the extremists attacked the home of B. Abeywickrene
in the town of Akuressa, 80 miles south of Colombo.
   Abeywickrene, secretary to the district's chief minister, was
not home at the time, the officers said.
   The victims were two police constables, a bodyguard assigned to
Abeywickrene and two civilians, the officers said.
   On Saturday, the extremists shot to death Serasinghe Nandapala,
a candidate from Jayewardene's party in upcoming local council
elections, police said.
   Both attacks were blamed on the People's Liberation Front, made
up of extremists from the ethnic Sinhalese majority opposed to
making concessions to the minority Tamils.
   The government announced Tuesday that it signed an accord with
the front to end its bloody attacks, which have taken the lives of
more than 260 politicians and government officials since last July.
But on Wednesday, the underground leader of the group denounced the
pact and said he had not signed it.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the
Indian-brokered peace accord signed last July 29 and aimed at
ending a five-year Tamil separatist war.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and military.
   Sinhalese make up about 75 percent of the population. The rest
are Christian descendants of colonial settlers and Moslem
descendants of early Arab traders.
   India has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to try to
enforce the accord. Most of the troops are in the north and east,
where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam militia has continued
its insurgency despite the peace pact.
   India is involved because it is a regional power and because it
has 60 million ethnic Tamils in its southern states who are
sympathetic to their Sri Lankan brethren.

<TEXT>
   While others lands desperately fight
overpopulation, mainly Roman Catholic Quebec is trying to ignite a
new baby boom to safeguard the continent's only French-speaking
society.
   A generation ago, Quebec had the highest birthrate in the free
world. It was common for French-speaking couples in the province to
have five or more children.
   However, in a dramatic shift to fast-paced urban life, Quebecers
now have one of the lowest rates in the West, down from an average
of 4.5 children to just 1.4.
   Concerned that any decline in its 6.6 million population will
eventually doom the continent's only French society, the government
has announced a package of incentives to encourage a new baby boom.
   To begin with, the province will hand out $405 for a couple's
first child and $405 for a second child. For a third child and each
subsequent child, parents will get $2,430 in quarterly installments
over two years.
   The bonuses apply to both married and single parents.
   Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government has promised 60,000
new day- care spaces over the next seven years; no more taxes on
family allowances; and an interest-free loan of $5,670 to help
families with two or more children buy their first home.
   If all that doesn't work, there could be more, Bourassa said in
an interview. ``We'll see in the next budget,'' he said.
   ``As the leader of the only French-speaking organized society in
North America, I have a responsibility. We've had a spectacular
decline in demography.''
   The aim is to boost the birth rate to 1.8 in the next five years.
   France Guerette and her husband, Pierre Blouin, new parents of
quadruplets, were among the first couples to reap the benefits of
last week's handout. With six children in all, they will get $9,720
in bonuses alone.
   ``We are so very happy. It will certainly help,'' said Guerette.
   But some people doubt the policy can reverse a trend that began
with Quebec's so-called Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, a cultural
awakening led by the urban-based Liberal Party that spawned
economic reforms and a new emphasis on education. Church influence
declined as young people left rural areas for the cities.
   Power shifted from the English minority to the 81-percent French
majority during the 1970s, a tumultuous decade of separatist
sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a sovereignty
referendum in 1980.
   Since then, Quebecers have focused on improved living standards
and competitiveness. The province boasted 5 percent real growth
last year and produced 40 percent of Canada's business
administration students.
   ``In one generation, Quebec women became the biggest consumers
of the pill,'' said Montreal Mayor Jean Dore, who says the island
core of his city has 1.9 million inhabitants but could sustain 3.5
million.
   Quebec was also the first Canadian province to permit abortion
on demand.
   Sociologist Morton Weinfeld of Montreal's McGill University
warned that the handouts could backfire by creating more
welfare-dependent poor children while failing to encourage upwardly
mobile couples to have babies.
   ``Then the problem is that society is going to have to provide
adequate social services and education to give these children an
equal opportunity,'' Weinfeld said.
   Indeed, Montrealers Fred and Sylvie Bush, who earn $60,750 a
year between them and just bought a new house, said the baby boom
policy won't influence them.
   ``We're not going to start making babies tomorrow,'' said Bush,
30. ``We want to keep our lifestyle,'' his wife added.
   University of Montreal demographer Jacques Henripin suggested
longer paid maternity leave and better part-time job opportunities
as the long-term solution. ``Nobody is going to have a child just
to get $405,'' he said.
   The government has one other tool to boost population growth.
Quebec will welcome 27,000 immigrants this year and is eager to
take more, provided they remain in the province and educate their
children in French.

   About 125 men, most of them Sikh
extremists, surrendered to police Sunday after Indian security
forces fired hundreds of rounds from machine guns and automatic
rifles into the besieged Golden Temple complex.
   Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill said 40 to 50 Sikh extremists
were still holed up in the temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine.
   Police said 18 women and eight children, all believed to be
relatives of the militants, also walked from the temple compound,
which has been surrounded for a week by 2,800 security forces.
   Among those who surrendered was Surjit Singh Penta, 24, a
fugitive wanted for killing more than 150 people, including 30 in
attacks in New Delhi last year.
   Police said that when recognized by security officers, Penta
asked for a glass of water and used it to down poison. He died
later at a local hospital.
   Gill said police prevented Penta's brother, Harcharan Singh,
from similarly committing suicide. Penta's wife and their
5-year-old son were among the women and children who surrendered,
police said.
   Sikh radicals, who launched their guerrilla campaign for a
separate homeland in 1982, have been blamed for killing more than
960 people in Punjab state since the start of the year. They
allegedly killed more than 1,030 last year.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sunday that the Golden Temple's jailed head priest, Jasbir Singh
Rode, has been asked to urge the remaining militants to surrender.
   Rode and three of the other four high priests were jailed
Thursday after they attempted to lead a procession to the Golden
Temple to restore their authority and resume religious rites. Rode
was out of the temple May 9 when the confrontation began.
   Four bodies were carried out of the temple Sunday, raising to at
least 35 the number of people who have died since the siege began.
All but five of the victims are believed to be militants.
   The police chief said some of the men who surrendered where seen
throwing weapons into debris scattered inside the temple complex
before emerging.
   ``Till proof to the contrary, everyone will be treated as a
terrorist or an associate,'' Gill said.
   Earlier Sunday, security forces fired incendiary shells at the
clock tower overlooking the northern entrance to the complex and
set the tower ablaze.
   Black smoke billowed from the 50-foot tower over the north
entrance to the temple complex after police hit it with a barrage
of bullets about 9:30 a.m.
   Despite the fire, militants later went back into the tower and
fired on the police cordon. The militants also remained in control
of at least one interior tower near the center of the complex.
   The siege on the temple was launched May 9 after militants
inside opened fire on a group of security force commanders who were
making an inspection outside the temple. Five people were injured.
   About 800 people, most of them Sikh pilgrims, were evacuated
from the temple complex last Tuesday. A handful of Sikh men crept
out of the complex Saturday night and surrendered, police said
Sunday.
   On Saturday, S.S. Ray, the federally appointed governor of
Punjab state, issued what he termed ``a last warning'' to the
militants to surrender.
   ``If the terrorists refuse to see reason, then no one should
blame us for our action,'' he said in a statement from the state
capital at Chandigarh.
   Ray did not give any deadline for the surrender.
   The government is hesitant to enter the shrine because it
offends religious Sikhs. The Golden Temple was built about 400
years ago.
   The Indian army in June 1984 staged a massive assault on the
temple to drive out Sikh militants. More than 1,200 died in the
raid.
   Less than five months later, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge. Her death
set off anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi and other northern Indian
cities in which at least 2,000 were killed, many of them innocent
Sikhs.
   The temple complex consists of three sections. The temple itself
stands in the center of a reflecting pool at the western end. In
the mid-section are the community dining hall and prayer hall. To
the east are offices, which Indian forces captured earlier last
week.
   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, say they are discriminated
against by India's Hindu majority. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million population but are a majority in
Punjab.

<HEAD>Former Reagan Adviser Says Casey Maneuvered to Weaken Oversight of
CIA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The late CIA Director William J. Casey
successfully maneuvered to weaken White House oversight of U.S.
foreign intelligence operations while the Iran-Contra affair was
taking shape, according to a book by a former aide to President
Reagan.
   The book, ``Revolution,'' by Martin Anderson, published by
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, also says that former White House chief
of staff Donald T. Regan abetted Casey in his move although he was
``uneasy'' about it.
   Anderson, who was Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser during
part of his first term and became a member of the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in his second term, describes
steps leading up to a reorganization of the board in November 1985.
   The board, originally 21 members, was reduced to 14 by firing 11
members and adding four new ones, making it what Anderson called a
``celebrity board.''
   ``When the 21-member-strong PFIAB that used to probe widely and
deeply without caution was transformed into a much smaller board,
dominated by famous, very busy people, one of the last effective
potential checks on Casey and the intelligence community was
gone,'' Anderson wrote.
   ``It is impossible to say for certain that if the old PFIAB was
in place the Iran-Contra affair would not have happened,'' he said.
``But a large, vigorous board would have made it more likely that
the skullduggery would have been discovered much, much earlier.''
   According to Anderson's account, the initial complaints about
the board's size came from Anne Armstrong, its chairman. He wrote
that Casey, however, ``did not like the old PFIAB'' and
``graciously allowed Mrs. Armstrong to be his stalking horse.''
   He wrote in the book that Robert C. McFarlane, then the
president's national security adviser, supported Casey and Mrs.
Armstrong, although he later told Anderson in an interview that he
regretted this.
   McFarlane had an aide, Kenneth de Graffenreid, draft a letter
reorganizing the board, which was sent to the president for his
consideration and signature, bypassing Regan.
   Reagan telephoned his chief of staff, according to an account
that Regan gave Anderson in an interview, and said, ``Don, why are
we firing all of these people?''
   Regan, caught by surprise, called Mrs. Armstrong, who told him
the board was so large it was unwieldy.
   Regan ``still felt uneasy,'' wrote Anderson. ``This was not
something he wanted responsibility for.''
   So he arranged a meeting for Mrs. Armstrong to make the case
directly to the president.
   Reagan approved the firings, which were announced on Nov. 4,
1985.

   Some Union Pacific Railroad workers get to
rub elbows with the railroad's chairman in an unusual place _ in
the shower room of the company's new $500,000 fitness center.
   Chairman Michael Walsh said Friday that he showers and changes
clothes with the workers after he exercises at the new center at
the railroad's headquarters.
   ``I might be in the shower and some guy does a double-take,'' he
said.
   Curious employees will ask him, ``Aren't you the chairman?'' and
Walsh said he responds, ``Yes, nice to meet you.''
   The workers are surprised, Walsh said, because railroads have a
tradition of being ``very hierarchial organizations,'' in which top
managers and employees don't socialize.
   ``People are surprised when the chairman talks with them, let
alone shares a common shower,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Conservation Groups Would Help Third World Poor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two conservation groups are involved in a
project to help the poor in the Himalayan mountain kingdom of
Nepal, while at the same time protecting the birds and the beasts
there.
   As part of the project, the groups have encouraged the Nepalese
to sell kerosene to the thousands of Americans and mountain lovers
from other lands who trek to Annapurna in Nepal and use up wood on
the mountainside. The Nepalese also are getting training in growing
vegetables, running lodges and developing hot springs for the
mountain visitors.
   William K. Reilly, president of the U.S. branch of the World
Wildlife Fund and the affiliated Conservation Foundation, announced
the project last week at a news conference.
   It is similar to more than 20 projects that have been started
over the past two years from Mexico to Thailand, with a grant from
the Agency for International Development (AID). The conservation
groups have held off publicizing them until they could report some
success.
   Annapurna is one of the world's highest, most fragile and most
beautiful areas. It also is also one of the world's poorest areas.
   The average citizen of Nepal earns about $160 dollars a year,
less than 1 percent of the average U.S. income.
   ``It is poverty that causes degradation of the environment more
than anything else,'' Reilly said.
   Russell E. Train, chairman of their joint board of directors,
said the program has had a modest success and is on the right track.
   ``It has taken first steps, but they are important, satisfying
first steps,'' he said.
   The projects still have plenty of problems.
   The groups expect to cooperate with the World Bank, the major
international source of aid, which lends about $17 billion a year
to raise living standards in the Third World.
   In recent months it has greatly enlarged its staff that deals
with the environment and paid increasing attention to environmental
issues, after much prodding from the U.S. government and private
environmental organizations.
   It is owned by 151 countries, with the United States the biggest
stockholder.
   Reilly said he thought the bank, with its new interest in the
environment, and the conservationists, with new interest in people,
are moving toward one another.
   ``That's fine, as long as they don't forget to drop some money
as they go by us,'' he added.

<HEAD>Papal Visit Magnifies Church-State Tensions in Paraguay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's scheduled visit to
Paraguay has magnified a split between the 34-year-old
authoritarian government of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner and the
increasingly critical Roman Catholic clergy.
   The pontiff was scheduled to arrive Monday for a 57-hour visit
to this overwhelmingly Catholic country, the last stop on a 12-day
pilgrimage that has taken him to Uruguay, Bolivia and Peru.
   Perhaps the most politically sensitive stop, the visit has
spotlighted deteriorating ties between the church and the rightist
government, whose members often describe clerical critics as
communists and subversives.
   In turn, clerics _ 19 of whom have been expelled by the
government since 1969 _ frequently attack alleged government
corruption, election fraud and human and civil rights violations.
   Although the government and the church collaborated in drawing
up papal activities, each has accused the other of attempting to
manipulate the pope's visit for political purposes.
   A furor arose last week when the government abruptly canceled
``for security reasons'' a Tuesday night meeting of the pontiff and
the Builders of Society, a civic group that includes members of
opposition political parties not recognized by the government.
   Vatican pressure and two days of talks finally won a reversal.
The government agreed to allow the meeting in a state-run sports
arena but said it would hold the church responsible for ensuring
``its religious nature.''
   Jose Maria Troche of the Episcopal Conference said 3,800 people
had been invited to the meeting.
   But only 140 members of the government, President Stroessner's
ruling Colorado Party and the armed forces were included.
   Although the party, whose official newspaper Patria earlier
described the meeting as a ``corrupt assembly,'' made no official
comment, party spokesmen told Asuncion newspapers Sunday that
members would boycott the meeting.
   Party spokesmen said invitations were disproportionate with a
February national election that gave the party and Stroessner _
re-elected to eight straight terms after a 1954 coup _ 89 precent
of the vote. The opposition claims the election was fraudulent.
   Stroessner controls the government with his Colorado Party.
Though Paraguay has elections in which some recognized opposition
candidates are elected, two-thirds of Congress belong to the
Colorado Party.
   The church has criticized the decision to allow only
state-controlled radio and television to cover papal activities in
this nation of 3.8 million, where about 97 percent of the
population is Catholic.
   While Radio Caritas, the church station that often airs
interviews with opposition leaders, announced it would refrain from
government criticism during the papal visit, all stations _
including Caritas _ are obliged to relay official coverage.
   ``How can those who describe our bishops, priest and laymen as
communists hope to explain to our people the feelings of the
church?'' said Monsignor Pastor Cuquejo, auxiliary bishop of
Asuncion and coordinator of the Paraguay portion of the visit.
   Public reaction to the papal visit was mixed, although elaborate
preparations were nearing completion in this capital of 800,000 and
the four interior cities to be visited by the pontiff.
   ``Sure, there is a lot of enthusiasm, just look at that,'' said
a taxi driver as he pointed to a huge altar built near Asuncion's
international airport. Hundreds of army conscripts were cutting
grass with machetes around the city.
   Asuncion streets were freshly scrubbed and decorated with
welcoming banners.
   Yet there were signs of ennui. ``I think the people are plain
tired of the pope,'' said a Paraguayan journalist who requested
anonymity. ``Don't forget, this is his last stop, and people have
been following his trip since May 7.''
   He said his newspaper had received numerous calls from mothers
who complained that their children had lost too much class time in
practicing for papal events.

<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla leader said Sunday
his fighters will attack the key Afghan city of Jalalabad as soon
as it is free of Red Army troops.
   Mahmood, a commander in the radical Hezb-I-Islami guerrilla
faction, made the claim as the first of an estimated 6,000 Soviet
soldiers left Jalalabad, a strategic city in northeastern
Afghanistan 45 miles west of the Pakistan border.
   The Soviet troops are reportedly being replaced by up to 12,000
soldiers from the Afghan army.
   ``There will be a lot of army there. It will need a lot of
pressure,'' Mahmood said.
   He said he had 10,000 men under his command near the city but
could not predict when Jalalabad, the heavily fortified capital of
Nangarhar province, would be in rebel hands.
   He explained that the city is surrounded by land mines, canals
and rivers.
   ``Some Mujahedeen cannot swim,'' Mahmood said with a sheepish
grin.
   Mujahedeen, or holy warrior, is a term the rebels use to
describe themselves. They have been fighting the Soviet-backed
communist government in Kabul for 10 years.
   Mahmood said his fighters would make full use of anti-aircraft
weapons to shoot down Soviet and Afghan helicopters as they
evacuate Soviet troops or resupply Kabul troops.
   The rebels claimed they shot down two Soviet MI-24 helicopter
gunships over Jalalabad on Friday.
   Accompanied by district commander Zurabgul Khomainy, Mahmood
said his fighters, in coordination with three other parties of
rebel fighters, would concentrate first on the security posts
surrounding Jalalabad, then work on clearing mines.
   The United States, a major arms supplier to the guerrillas, has
recently sent them sophisticated mine-clearing devices. As with
other commanders, Mahmood would not be specific about which weapons
his men possess but described their supply situation as ``less than
we wish.''
   Over the past month, the rebels reportedly have overrun dozens
of security posts in eastern Afghanistan as Soviet forces handed
them over to Kabul troops.
   ``The morale of the Mujahedeen is very good, but the morale of
the Kabul army is weak now,'' said Mahmood.
   The rebel forces recently proposed a limited amnesty to Afghan
regulars, saying that any troops who surrender within four weeks of
the Soviets' withdrawal will not be tried for war crimes.
   The fall of Jalalabad would be a major blow to Afghan President
Najib in his effort to keep his Marxist government in power after
the Soviet withdrawal.
   Under terms of an accord signed in Geneva in April, all Soviet
troops must be out of Afghanistan in nine months.
   Pakistan is a conduit of arms to the guerrillas and serves as
their headquarters. It also shelters about 3.5 million war refugees.

   Security forces Sunday surrounded a house
where seven suspected Kurdish insurgents were hiding and killed
them in a 1{-hour shootout, the Anatolia news agency reported.
   A Turkish soldier also was killed and two policemen were injured
after the trapped Kurds refused to surrender and fired on the
troops, the news agency said. The clash was in Bayrakli village in
southeastern Turkey near the Syrian border.
   Anatolia did not say what outlawed group the guerrillas belonged
to, but most of the insurgents operating in the region are linked
to the Kurdish Labor Party. The group seeks to set up a Marxist
state in parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   After the clash, security forces seized five Soviet-made
Kalashnikov automatic rifles, one M-16 automatic rifle, seven hand
grenades, ammunition and illegal documents, the dispatch said.
   Last week, Kurdish rebels raided two hamlets and killed 25
villagers in Nusaybin, 50 miles east of Derik, and Sirnak, 110
miles east of Derik.
   Nearly 900 civilians and military personnel and about 900
Kurdish rebels have been killed since guerrillas started
hit-and-run attacks in 1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
52 million.

<HEAD>China Setting Up Debt Management Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's government, concerned about its growing
foreign debt, is setting up a debt management office to ensure that
borrowing does not exceed its ability to pay, an official report
said Sunday.
   The English-language newspaper China Daily said the State
Council, China's cabinet, is expected to approve plans to establish
the office in the Ministry of Finance, according to an unidentified
source in the ministry.
   It said the department will ``supervise all of China's foreign
and domestic debts'' and set up a buffer fund to ensure
availability of cash to pay interest.
   It also will play a role in drafting the national budget and
debt policies and establishing accounting systems, the report said.
It did not specify if the department will have authority to veto
loans it considers unwise.
   China's foreign debt totaled about $16.8 billion at the end of
last year, the report said, up from zero 10 years ago when the
country began its drive to open its markets and absorb foreign
technology.
   Although international debt experts still consider China a good
risk, Chinese economists have expressed concern over the lack of
central control over borrowing.
   Three ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, two banks
and 10 provinces have independent authority to borrow money
directly from foreign banks and issue bonds in foreign currencies.
   In an effort to stimulate development, the government has given
increasing autonomy to coastal cities and provinces to make their
own economic decisions, including foreign loans.
   Several companies have been unable to repay loans from foreign
banks and have sought government assistance.
   The China Daily indicated the government is not seeking to cut
back on foreign borrowing, only to supervise it more closely.
   It quoted the Ministry of Finance source as saying China expects
to increase its foreign debt through 1990 but will borrow only to
build key state projects.
   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was quoted as
telling visiting Irish President Patrick Hillery last week that
China's slow growth in past decades was due to reluctance to borrow.
   He said China's principles are to borrow only for ``potentially
profitable projects'' and to take careful account of the borrower's
debt-servicing ability, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Skagway's Railroad Link to Gold Rush Days Running Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE CROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SKAGWAY, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call this a gold rush town, and no one
will argue. The window displays of miners' picks and gold pans, the
restored bawdy houses and the can-can dancers all say ``Klondike.''
   But since the cars of the White Pass & Yukon railroad rolled out
of town Thursday and up the Trail of '98 for the first time in more
than five years, Skagway's gotten back what locals consider its
real image.
   ``It gives us our identity back. Skagway's always been a
railroad town,'' says Gary Danielson, a train man turned city
tourism director.
   For 82 years after its completion in 1900, the White Pass &
Yukon was the life of Skagway. It carried freight, miners and
tourists from this seaport town up through the White Pass of the
Coast Mountains, to the Yukon Territory of Canada. While other gold
rush boom towns died and disappeared, Skagway prospered with its
railroad.
   The bust came in June 1982. With closure of the Yukon's
Cyprus-Anvil lead and zinc mine, the railroad lost its cargo and
three-quarters of its revenues. It closed a few months later.
   The town of 800 people lost 150 jobs, and in the decline that
followed, nearly half its population.
   ``For a lot of people it was, face it: If you're going to live
in Skagway, you're going to draw unemployment,'' recalls Lee
Hartson, one of those suddenly left jobless.
   Hartson left town to work on the Alaska Railroad in Anchorage,
at U.S. Customs and a few other jobs.
   Many railroad families stayed in Skagway, but the town lost its
pride, says Dawn Nelson, an 11-year resident.
   ``Up until the train quit running, we could say we were a
railroad town. And that has a different connotation than being just
a tourist town,'' Nelson says.
   Now she listens for the shrill whistle of Engine No. 73 as it
rolls down the tracks a few blocks from the dress shop where she
works _ the sound that says all's well again in Skagway.
   ``Hearing that steam whistle blow was a part of our lives, part
of every day,'' she says. ``It sounds wonderful.''
   Hartson's living by the whistle as well, back as conductor since
the White Pass & Yukon was reborn as a tourist attraction.
   At least twice a day, he'll be loading passengers at the cruise
ship docks for a three-hour ride along the tracks that shadow the
Deadhorse Trail, the path that once wore out men and killed their
horses.
   The White Pass steams at a steady 15 mph up the gorge of the
Skagway River, past the grave of ``Soapy'' Smith, legendary badman
of the gold rush barrooms, and past the White Pass ghost town where
thousands once rested before their final assent to the summit and
the Canadian border _ 20.4 miles and 2,865 vertical feet from the
seaside depot.
   From the snow-packed cliff above the summit's Deadhorse Gulch,
where the train turns around, there's little to see but much to
sense.
   ``Trail of '98'' says the marker, the only break in a landscape
of snow and rock and stunted spruce. The snow, head-high in May,
shrouds the bones of more than 3,000 pack animals driven to death
by the Klondike-bound in the winter of 1897 and 1898.
   There's a sense of the dead and the desperate in the rock walls
of White Pass. But it's a living history that Steve Hites is
peddling as he sashays through the cars of the White Pass & Yukon
in turn-of-the-century garb.
   ``These wooden parlor cars, they're works of art. They're museum
pieces,'' says Hites, who started as a baggage handler in 1972 and
now is the railroad's promotion man.
   As other narrow-gauge railroads were abandoned throughout North
America, White Pass collected cars dating to 1883. The gypsy-wagon
roof shapes _ turtlebacks and clerestories to railroad buffs _
cover art deco interiors complete with ornate stoves.
   The first White Pass coaches, four flatbeds with benches,
carried local celebrities to the end of the line, then four miles
from town, on July 21, 1898.
   Miners immediately began buying rides along the half-built line
to escape the brutal path below, but granite, weather and an
unsteady work force delayed the line's completion two more years.
   Miners laid iron whenever they were broke, then abandoned the
tracks when they got enough pay to make a run for the gold fields.
   ``There was the old joke about the White Pass having three
crews: the crew that had left, the crew that was thinking of
leaving, and the crew that was being brought in,'' Hites says.
   The last spike on the White Pass was driven in Carcrosse, Yukon,
on July 29, 1900.
   By 1901, the White Pass was in the tourism business, selling
eight-day luxury excursions from Seattle to Dawson, Yukon, by
steamship, railway and riverboat.
   The future, Hites says, is still uncertain. The line needs
50,000 passengers a year, at $67 a head, to stay in business. Hites
won't know until next year if that's realistic.
   In Skagway, they aren't worried.
   The population's topping 700 again, almost 250,000 tourists are
expected this year, and Danielson says two more cruise ships have
promised to come in 1989 because of the railroad.
   ``It gives us the anchor that we need,'' Danielson said. ``It
seems like we have everything back again.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Gains Ground as Iowa Democrats Pick Delegates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
continued to gain steam among Iowa Democrats, winning the bulk of
delegates selected at congressional district conventions this
weekend.
   Dukakis won 12 of the 34 delegates at stake, while backers of
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt were able to elect nine delegates
who are technically uncommitted.
   Gephardt won the state's Feb. 8 precinct caucuses, but has since
dropped out of the race. Many of the nine uncommitted delegates are
expected to endorse Dukakis.
   That group remained together to make it easier to elect their
leaders to cherished national delegate posts at the convention in
Atlanta, July 18-21. Party leaders list them as neutral, although
some insisted on carrying Gephardt's banner.
   Jesse Jackson, Dukakis' sole remaining active opponent, won
seven delegates, while Illinois Sen. Paul Simon collected six.
Simon has put his campaign on hold, but is still technically an
active candidate and eligible for delegates.
   Dukakis backers said they were satisfied with the outcome of the
six district conventions, and party officials said the results
showed Iowa joining the rest of the nation in handing the
Massachusetts governor the front-runner's mantle.
   ``I think certainly nobody should be surprised,'' said Iowa
Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder. ``Dukakis came out on top,
which is what he should have done.''
   He predicted Dukakis' margin would grow during the month leading
to the party's state convention on June 25, when 18 more delegates
will be selected. The state convention is the final step in Iowa's
four-step process of choosing delegates. The early round precinct
caucuses pushed Iowa into the national spotlight because it was the
nation's first contest, but no delegates were picked.
   In addition to the delegates elected at Saturday's conventions,
Iowa will send nine ``super delegates''_ party leaders and elected
officials whose titles won them seats as delegates _ to the
national convention.
   Two super delegates have already endorsed Dukakis, including
State Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell who came under criticism Saturday
at some of the conventions for her endorsement. Some activists
introduced resolutions calling for her to drop her support.
   ``If she had it to do all over again, she'd do the same thing,''
Roeder said, arguing that her endorsement was important in currying
favor with Dukakis in hopes of retaining the state's early place in
the nominating battle.

<HEAD>Louisiana Governor Wages Budget Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After outlining legislative programs
designed to pay off Louisiana's ballooning deficit, Gov. Buddy
Roemer has conceded that he's going to have to scale down some of
his proposals.
   During the first three weeks of the annual session, legislators
have grilled the new governor's budget officials and questioned
whether his budget is balanced. The House also watered down one of
the governor's key legislative programs _ tightening up campaign
finance laws.
   Roemer has proposed a $7.8 billion state budget for the new
fiscal year, down from the $8.1 billion plan approved for the
1987-88 fiscal year.
   During his campaign, Roemer had ambitious plans for economic
development, for revamping the state's tax system and for improving
education and the environment.
   He believed then that the state faced a $150 million shortfall.
However, when he took office two months ago, he found he had
inherited a $2 billion crisis.
   Shortly before his inauguration, he said his role as governor
would have to combine the two roles of crisis manager and long-term
planner.
   ``They (legislators) know we've got a lot of work to do and it
can't be all my way. I don't expect that,'' Roemer said. ``But I
wanted us to get off the mark and get to work on these problems
together.''
   One of the trickiest issues facing the new governor is how to
reach his goal of weaning local governments and school boards from
state subsidies that now total more than $400 million a year.
   During Louisiana's populist history, the state has appropriated
money for supplemental pay for police and firefighters and parish
road funds. It has also paid for school bus drivers and school
cafeteria workers.
   Following meetings with mayors, demonstrations at the Capitol by
school employees and criticism from lawmakers, Roemer said last
week that some type of ``bridge funding'' would be provided for the
next fiscal year.
   However, he didn't say how much the funding would total _ or
where it would come from.
   Roemer added about $95 million to his budget last week to
restore a planned 10 percent pay cut for state employees and keep a
charity hospital open as a clinic.
   To make up part of the difference, most state agencies would
take an additional 3 percent across-the-board cut in administrative
costs, and patients at state charity hospitals would have to pay a
small fee for each visit.
   Although the Roemer administration has maintained that the
proposed budget is in balance, it has acknowledged that the budget
overlooks a projected $260 million loss in state sales taxes.
   Rep. Raymond Laborde, a former floor leader for Gov. Edwin
Edwards, who was ousted last fall by Roemer, said, ``I don't think
this budget is balanced. I don't think the governor thinks this
budget is balanced. I don't think the governor's people think this
budget is balanced.''
   Last week, the House refused to go along with many of Roemer's
proposals to tighten up campaign finance laws, although it did
approve some restrictions on contributions.
   The governor wants a law in which all cash contributions are
outlawed and candidates must report 10 days in advance the amount
of money they'll be doling out for ``get-out-the-vote'' efforts on
election day and who will receive that cash. The House refused to
go along with those proposals.
   During his campaign, Roemer limited individual contributors to
$1,000 and took no money from political action committees.
   Under the measure that finally emerged from the House, no
candidate for statewide office could receive more than $5,000 from
any individual or from any political action committee.
   ``They put some limits on individual contributions. They limited
PACs which you know is important to me,'' Roemer said. ``They've
got some things I wish weren't in there, but they've made a step
forward.''

   Democrats and Republicans have yet to
nominate their parties' standard-bearers this November, but 15
modern-day Betsy Rosses are embroidering the flags that will
accompany the new president who will take office next January.
   In the basement of Building 13 of the Defense Department's
supply center, below the gymnasium-sized rooms where huge spools of
olive drab thread turn into acres of U.S. Army fatigues, the women
of the embroidering room serve the next president with needles in
hand and thimbles on fingers.
   Beyond the whine of sewing machines, behind the cinder block
walls, the basement of Building 13 is the only place in the country
where the president's flags are made.
   Tiny spots of chalk dust outline the eagle and stars that make
up the president's coat of arms, as the women gently poke 19 colors
of silk and synthetic threads through the navy blue rayon banner,
held taut across a wooden rack.
   For the women in the embroidery room, who spend most of their
time embroidering detail on military units' flags, the opportunity
to work on a flag for the president holds a special thrill.
   ``When he talks on television, I look at the seal,'' said Maria
T. Negron, who learned embroidery as a hobby while growing up in
Puerto Rico.
   The women embroider hundreds of flags each year for various
military units, Cabinet members and Congress, but the presidential
flag is most important, the workers said.
   ``We make sure all the employees get a chance to work on a
presidential flag. It's one of the best morale builders,'' said
Frank Bennett, production chief at the center's manufacturing
directorate.
   One worker can embroider both sides of a 4-foot, 4-inch by
5-foot, 6-inch presidential flag in nine weeks, Bennett said.
However, if a deadline is looming, two or more women will embroider
the same flag, he said.
   Two or three flags are made for the president in most years, but
with a new president taking office, seven new flags are being
created.
   ``This flag symbolizes the most powerful office in the world.
And wherever he goes, the flag goes with him,'' Bennett said.
   At least five are always in use: one at the Oval Office, one
aboard Air Force One, one at the White House portico for outdoor
speeches and receptions for heads of state, one with the
president's honor guard, and one as backup, said Col. Victor M.
Hernandez, chief of the manufacturing directorate at the supply
center.
   Laden with symbolism, the coat of arms features an American
eagle clasping an olive branch in one talon and a bundle of 13
arrows in the other. A constellation of 13 stars runs through a
series of rays coming from the eagle's shoulders. The rays shoot
through an arc of thirteen cloud puffs.
   The coat of arms also appears on the president's seal, which is
most often seen attached to the front of a lectern.
   The embroidery room is staffed by middle-aged women who
recognize that few members of the younger generation are interested
in hand embroidery.
   ``Both sides have to be the same. No machine can ever do that,''
said Connnie Martins, who brought her skill to Philadelphia from
Portugal about 18 years ago. ``My daughter, she doesn't like it.''
   Each stitch is matched on each side of the flag, so the eagle
looking to his right on one side is looking to its left on the
other. The only part that doesn't appear backward on the flag's
opposite side are the words ``E Pluribus Unum,'' Latin for ``out of
many, one.''
   When the embroidery is finished, a synthetic gold-tone fringe is
stitched to three sides of the flag.

<HEAD>Soviet Withdrawal Is A Great Day But Peace Is Far Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghans and Pakistanis in this hot,
dusty border town agreed that Sunday was a great day because Soviet
troops were starting to leave Afghanistan, but they also agreed
that peace was still far away.
   ``Yes, I am happy. This is a great day, but only God knows when
there will be peace and I can go home,'' said Khaled, an Afghan
refugee from Kabul.
   He now runs a shop selling jewelry, Afghan carpets and war
souvenirs in Peshawar's squalid Saddar Bazaar.
   There were no celebrations in this city, headquarters of Moslem
anti-communist guerrillas, or in its sun-baked environs that are
temporary home to about 3.5 million refugees of the Afghan war.
   It was business as usual, although things were moving a bit
slowly as the local Moslems endured 104-degree heat, compounded by
the religious month, Ramadan, which forbids eating from sunrise to
sunset.
   Horse and bullock carts hauling sugar cane and fruits plodded
through the narrow smelly streets of the old city. Three-wheeled
taxis droned in and out of traffic, fouling the air with pungent
white exhaust.
   The only relief was a brief afternoon dust storm, which added
grime to sweaty brows.
   At the offices of the seven main guerrilla parties, the bearded
turbaned men alternately slept or continued to plan their
anti-communist war effort.
   Mahmood, a member of the Hezb-I-Islami faction and the chief
guerrilla commander of Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province,
said May 15 was no special day.
   ``For us, it's the same. We haven't just started fighting,'' he
said. ``We'll continue our holy war.''
   The idea, as so frequently explained by the guerrillas, is that
Afghanistan should be ruled by Moslems and not by the pro-Moscow
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which they consider
atheist.
   In the money-changing market of the old city, business seemed
slow.
   ``People are fasting, they don't have the energy to trade,''
said Shabir, a Pakistani.
   Manshi, a Pakistani driver of a battered Toyota taxi, said he
was glad the Red Army was leaving Afghanistan because it would mean
the return of the refugees.
   ``They take our jobs because they work cheap,'' he said as he
swerved to avoid an oncoming truck, covered in chrome and painted
in a kaleidescope of colors.
   ``I know it's hard for them, but they cost us many many money.''
   For Peshawar, described by U.N. officials as the refugee capital
of the world, Sunday was the start of a new chapter in history.
   But the general feeling seemed to be that it wouldn't be printed
in ink until all Soviet troops leave Afghanistan and its Marxist
government falls.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with 1,204 adults in
the continental United States. The phone numbers were selected
randomly by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult
resident of each home who had the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that
theoretically the results would be within 3 percentage points of
the same 19 times out of 20 if every adult American were asked the
same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ five
points for Republicans, for example, and nine points for
respondents who have done postgraduate work.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll:
   1. Do you think the president of the United States and the
leader of the Soviet Union should meet at regular intervals even
without any major items on the agenda, or should they meet only to
complete major treaties?
   Regular intervals: 78 percent. Major treaties: 16 percent. Don't
know or no answer: 6 percent.
   2. The United States and the Soviets recently agreed on a treaty
to abolish each country's medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
Do you think that will increase the chance of non-nuclear war in
Europe, decrease the chance of non-nuclear war in Europe, or won't
it make much of a difference?
   Increase: 11 percent. Decrease: 26 percent. Not much difference:
55 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   3. Do you support or oppose the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
each country's medium-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know, no answer:
12 percent.
   4. Would you support or oppose a U.S.-Soviet treaty to abolish
50 percent of each country's long-range nuclear weapons?
   Support: 73 percent. Oppose: 15 percent. Don't know or no
answer: 12 percent.
   5. If the United States and the Soviet Union abolished all their
nuclear weapons, do you think that would increase the chance of
non-nuclear war, decrease it, or wouldn't it make much of a
difference?
   Increase, 22 percent. Decrease, 30 percent. Not much difference,
40 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   6. Ronald Reagan has proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative,
known as Star Wars, as a missile defense system. Do you think the
United States should drop SDI in exchange for a Soviet agreement to
a big cut in nuclear weapons?
   Yes, 33 percent. No, 49 percent. Don't know or no answer, 18
percent.
   7. Without an arms agreement with the Soviets, do you think work
on SDI should proceed as it is now, or should it be increased, or
reduced, or dropped?
   Proceed as now, 37 percent. Increase, 19 percent. Reduce, 13
percent. Drop, 17 percent. Don't know or no answer, 14 percent.
   8. Which country do you think has more political influence in
the world right now _ the United States, or the Soviet Union, or
are they about equal?
   United States, 41 percent. Soviet Union, 14 percent. About
equal, 38 percent. Don't know or no answer, 7 percent.
   9. Which country do you think is stronger militarily right now _
the United States, or the Soviet Union, or are they about equal?
   United States 28 percent. Soviet Union 33 percent. About equal
29 percent. Don't know or no answer, 10 percent.
   10. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev?
   Favorable, 54 percent. Unfavorable, 20 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 26 percent.
   11. Overall, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of
President Reagan?
   Favorable, 59 percent. Unfavorable, 31 percent. Don't know or no
answer, 10 percent.
   12. Do you approve or disapprove of the way President Reagan is
handling relations with the Soviet Union?
   Approve, 71 percent. Disapprove, 17 percent. Don't know or no

arms control agreements?
   Yes, 24 percent. No, 61 percent. Don't know or no answer, 15
percent.

<HEAD>Conductor Finds Errors In Published Dvorak Scores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orchestras for decades have been playing the wrong
version of Anton Dvorak's ``New World Symphony'' and at least five
of his other symphonies, a conductor who analyzed his original
manuscripts said Sunday.
   Denis Vaughan, who spent two weeks examining the manuscripts in
Czechoslovakia, said he found hundreds of differences between six
of Dvorak's original scores and the versions that were published in
the last century.
   They include differences in phrasing, nuance, accent, dynamics
and the way various instruments are blended, he told The Associated
Press.
   ``The differences are audible to everyone and will enthrall
listeners the world over,'' he said.
   Vaughan said Dvorak's wit and composing skills were beyond his
early editors, who took out his idiosyncrasies and wrote straight
versions of what they thought he meant.
   ``In, for instance, the Eighth Symphony, there's some tricky
delightful way in which each time he repeats a phrase, he does it
differently in a way which no conductor that I've met would have
dreamed possible of Dvorak,'' Vaughan said. ``It's just witty and
fresh and playful.''
   The variations were taken out and the phrases standardized
before the score was published, he said.
   Vaughan said Dvorak wrote his ninth symphony, the ``New World
Symphony,'' one of the most popular classical pieces, in the United
States in 1893. Dvorak mailed the score to his German publishers,
but since he was so far away, it was sent to Vienna where Johannes
Brahms, his contemporary and admirer, corrected the proofs.
   Vaughan said he has been deputy conductor for the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra in London, conductor at the Munich Opera
House and musical director of the State Opera of South Australia,
and now is a free-lance conductor.
   He said he has previously uncovered discrepancies between the
original scores and published works of Franz Schubert, Giuseppe
Verdi and Giacomo Puccini.
   Vaughan said he hopes to record the six Dvorak symphonies for
which the original manuscripts are available. He said it will take
him about a year to prepare the scores for an orchestra.

<HEAD>Cuomo Rips Bush For Reagan Policies, Keeping Quiet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, saying Michael Dukakis
will likely take the Democratic presidential nomination, has been
blasting the apparent Republican nominee, George Bush.
   Cuomo, once seen as a possible Democratic nominee, attacked
Reagan administration policies at a Seattle fund-raiser on Satuday
night, and said the vice president must share the responsibility.
   ``I hope George Bush will...explain what happened in
Iran-Contra. I hope George Bush will ...tell us why he did business
with (Panamanian leader Manuel) Noriega, who has been pumping drugs
into our children,'' he said.
   ``We need a government we can believe when it speaks to its
people. We have been lied to by this government,'' said the New
York governor.
   Cuomo predicted a big Democratic victory in the fall.
   ``The story of November is going to be the shock, not that the
Democrats won, but by how much they won,'' he said.
   But he said his party has its work cut out for it. To start
with, he said, Democrats must assure supporters of Jesse Jackson
``that Jesse isn't the only one who is concerned about the drug
problem, concerned about education, concerned about corporations
that leave this country to manufacture in foreign lands using cheap
labor.''
   Cuomo's appearance in Seattle was the end of a two-day West
Coast tour that started with an appearance for Rep. Nancy Pelosi in
San Francisco Friday night and a foreign policy speech before the
World Affairs Council of Oregon in Portland earlier Saturday.

<HEAD>Jackson Leader Says Nothing Gained From State Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's Georgia campaign chairman,
state Sen. Eugene Walker, has called off his challenge to incumbent
Democratic National Committee member Herb Mabry.
   A threatened challenge to Gov. Joe Frank Harris for leadership
of the state delegation to the Democratic National Convention did
not materialize.
   Decatur Mayor Michael Mears, the co-chairman of the state
Jackson campaign, said no progress was made on a list of
initiatives supported by the campaign.
   He said Harris refused to meet with him to talk about the
initiatives, which include helping blacks win local offices and
Supreme Court seats, giving Jackson backers paid party jobs,
putting more blacks and women in state management jobs, allowing
voter registration by mail and eliminating the Confederate battle
flag from the state flag.
   ``It's Old Guard 1, Jackson nothing,'' said Mears.
   Walker opened the meeting on Saturday by withdrawing his
candidacy for the Democratic National Committee member Herb Mabry,
the state AFL-CIO president. Mabry has held the seat for 15 years.
   Andrew Griffin Jr., a black supporter of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis said the standing ovation Walker received when he
withdrew from the national committee race might be a sign that
party leaders appreciate the Jackson campaign's efforts for unity.
   ``You could feel the sigh of relief,'' Griffin said. ``Now, the
party executives might say, `We owe them one _ they put unity above
everything else.'''

<HEAD>Israelis Celebrate Capture of Jerusalem; Arabs Mark `Day of
Calamity'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI C. RABIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Israelis attended ceremonies
Sunday marking the 21st anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem's
Arab sector. Arab stores observed a strike on what Palestinian
protesters called a ``day of calamity.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Jerusalem would remain
Israel's capital forever and said his government would never give
up the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Stores were shut throughout the occupied lands and in Arab East
Jerusalem in response to an order by leaders of the 5-month-old
Palestinian uprising to mark a ``day of calamity.'' Only scattered
protests were reported.
   The army clamped a curfew on the Shati refugee camp in Gaza and
the village of Anabta in the West Bank after disturbances the night
before.
   A 60-year-old Palestinian from Hebron died of a head wound
suffered in a beating four days ago, an official at the Moslem
Mukassad Hospital said Sunday.
   Palestinians accused Jewish settlers of beating Ibrahim Abu
Aishe, but an army spokesman quoted Aishe's family as saying
Palestinians attacked the man for violating an earlier strike
called by the underground leadership of the uprising.
   The latest death raised to 188 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8. A soldier and an Israeli teen-ager
also have died.
   Israel radio quoted an Israeli legislator, Yair Tzaban of the
left-wing Mapam party, as saying high school students recently beat
jailed Palestinians under the guidance of their paramilitary youth
group commander. The army had no comment on the report.
   Shamir spoke at a ceremony on Ammunition Hill, site of one of
the fiercest battles in which Israel's army seized East Jerusalem
from Jordan in 1967.
   ``There are still those who shun Jerusalem,'' Shamir told a
crowd of about 1,000. ``To all these we will say: Take your hands
off Jerusalem. No force in the world will change her destiny ... as
Israel's eternal capital and fortress of strength.''
   Although Jerusalem is Israel's declared capital and the seat of
the national government, few countries recognize it as such.
   Throughout the festivities marking the Hebrew calendar
anniversary of what Israelis call the city's reunification, there
were reminders of the Palestinian uprising.
   At the Wailing Wall, the only remaining outer wall of the
biblical Jewish Temple and Judaism's holiest site, youngsters and
organized tour groups passed through rigorous security checks to
enter the courtyard compound.
   Police barred a group of Jewish extremists, followers of
American Rabbi Meir Kahane, from visiting the Temple Mount to pray
Sunday morning, Israel radio reported.
   The hill is known in Arabic as Haram al-Sharif and contains the
Dome of the Rock, where Moslems believe Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   Jews also consider the Temple Mount holy as the site of two
ancient Jewish temples, one built by the biblical King Solomon.
   In other developments Sunday:
   _A military court sentenced Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino to four
months in jail and demoted him to private for allowing soldiers
under his command to bury alive four Palestinians on the West Bank
last February. The Palestinians were later rescued.
   _Israeli authorities restored press credentials to Glenn Frankel
of the Washington Post, whose press card was taken away when he
wrote that Israeli commandoes carried out the assassination of
Palestine Liberation Organization official Khalil Wazir last month
in Tunis.
   _World Jewish Congress president Edgar Bronfman told a news
conference after a trip to Moscow that the Soviet Union had
softened its terms for an international peace conference on the
Middle East.
   Bronfman said the Soviets now agreed the conference should not
have authority to dictate a solution to the parties concerned.

<TEXT>
   Red Army troops lumbered into Kabul on
Sunday after a daylong journey through mountains teeming with
guerrillas as the Soviet Union began its retreat from more than
eight years of war in Afghanistan.
   The 300-vehicle convoy set out at 7:30 a.m. for the 88-mile trip
from Jalalabad, passing through crowds of Afghan children who threw
flowers and an occasional clod of dirt or dung.
   As the motorized rifle unit crossed the towering mountains
separating Jalalabad from Kabul, shots rang out from distant hills
and the procession backed up in spots along the rough, one-way road.
   No casualties were reported.
   At 3:30 p.m., the convoy reached Kabul. About 2,000 Afghans
lined four miles of highway leading into the city, said a Western
photographer.
   Many of them were soldiers or members of communist youth
organizations, dressed in red shirts with white scarves.
   ``Today the Soviets are leaving. I'm happy for them,'' said Abdu
Samir, a 20-year-old soldier, as he watched the procession move
into Kabul.
   Samir said he hoped the Afghan army would be strong enough to
withstand attacks from anti-communist guerrillas.
   ``Long Live Friendship Between Afghanistan And The Soviet
Union,'' read a white banner, flapping along the highway. Stenciled
posters of a waving Soviet soldier were tacked up nearby.
   The Soviets planned to spend the night in Kabul before starting
the 200-mile trip to the Soviet border Monday.
   The convoy out of Jalalabad was the first of four that will
leave the northeastern city near the Pakistan border. As it made
its way toward Kabul, a guerrilla leader vowed that his men would
attack Jalalabad.
   Mahmood, a commander in the Hezb-I-Islami guerrilla faction,
said his 10,000 men would invade the city as soon as the Red Army
was out.
   Lt. Gen. Vladimir Bogdanov said the convoys would leave on
alternate days to allow traffic in the opposite direction to use
the road but that all Soviets based in Jalalabad would be withdrawn
within two weeks.
   Anti-Communist rebels fighting the Soviet-backed government of
President Najib control some of the mountainous regions through
which the convoy passed.
   Twenty Western journalists were brought to Jalalabad to ride
with the convoy to Kabul, and during the night spent in the
garrison city they heard heavy bombardment and felt the impact of a
surface-to-surface missile that landed 90 feet from their hotel.
   Information about the start of the withdrawal was provided by a
Reuters news agency pool report. Associated Press reporters were
barred from covering the event. Soviet officials said the exclusion
was the result of questions asked by the AP during a previous trip
to Kabul.
   Edmund McWilliams, deputy chief-of-mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Kabul, said the rebels have moved in closer to the capital and
stepped up attacks.
   ``We've had, as you may know, this past week, quite a bit of
rocketing of the city, and we're expecting possibly some more
rocketing tonight,'' McWilliams said Sunday. ``It does not appear,
though, at this point that the attacks ... will be affecting the
pullout.''
   Soviet troops and tanks moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979
to fight the anti-communist insurgency and replace one pro-Soviet
government with another.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan to bolster
Najib's forces, but all must pull back to Soviet territory within
the next nine months to comply with U.N.-mediated peace accords
signed in Geneva last month.
   Half the troops must leave by Aug. 15 under the agreement. Lt.
Gen. Boris Gromov told reporters Saturday that about one quarter of
the soldiers would be home before President Reagan visits Moscow on
May 29.
   The Soviet's departure will leave Najib's army of 50,000 alone
in its battle against about 200,000 Moslem insurgents. The
guerrillas have vowed to fight on to topple the Marxist government.
   Guerrillas and Western observers estimate that about 1.5 million
Afghans have died in the war.
   The U.S. State Department estimates Soviet casualties since 1979
at 33,000-38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.
   On Sunday, the Communist Party leadership in Moscow addressed
the departing troops with words of thanks and a call for their help
in improving Soviet life once they return home.
   ``Days of severe trials lie behind you,'' said the party Central
Committee address, printed on the front page of the party daily
Pravda. ``You have fulfilled the order of your homeland.''
   Tass reported that Najib sent a message of thanks to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Sunday, praising the ``heroic feat''
of the Soviets in helping defend his government.
   In a joint Soviet-Afghan statement carried by the official
Soviet news agency, the allied governments said the ``pivotal
issue'' in ending the civil war that has gripped Afghanistan for a
decade would be ensuring an end to ``interference from the outside
in the home affairs of the Afghans.''
   Soviet and Afghan officials have accused the United States and
Pakistan of exacerbating the war by delivering arms to the rebels.

<HEAD>Walesa Addresses Tens of Thousands at Mass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told tens of
thousands of worshipers at an outdoor Mass on Sunday that Poles
will ``give their all'' for the country only when their rights are
ensured.
   It was the biggest public appearance by Walesa since he and
about 1,000 followers emerged from the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk on
Tuesday to end a 9-day sit-in.
   The strikers gave up without winning concessions on pay or
recognition of Solidarity, the trade union federation outlawed
after the imposition of martial law in 1981.
   The Mass was celebrated in Walesa's home city of Gdansk, where
Pope John Paul II praised Solidarity during a visit to Poland 11
months ago.
   ``Workers and students keep Solidarity young and understand that
only solidarity of people and social groups can be the key to
overcoming the crisis in our homeland,'' said Walesa, who spoke for
about 10 minutes at the end of the Mass.
   ``People are willing to give their all for the common good only
when their full rights are safeguarded,'' he said.
   Aides to Walesa estimated the crowd at 50,000, while Western
journalists said there were at least 30,000 people.
   The Mass was celebrated by Wroclaw Bishop Cardinal Henryk
Gulbinowicz, who has special responsibility for workers within the
Polish church. It was attended by 30 bishops.
   The service culminated a series of devotions nationwide in honor
of the Black Madonna, the medieval painting that is Poland's most
revered icon.
   ``We thank you, mother of God, for the strength to survive the
past eight years,'' Walesa said, referring to the martial law
period of 1981-83 and Poland's current economic crisis. He said
Poles still have the courage to say: ``There is no freedom without
Solidarity.''
   Walesa was the final speaker among several people representing
various social groups.
   The gathering was predominantly religious, with almost no
Solidarity banners in evidence. Afterwards, people dispersed
peacefully.
   Walesa aide Bogdan Olszewski said in a telephone interview that
there has been no police harassment of people who took part in the
shipyard strike, which occurred during two weeks of labor unrest _
Poland's worst since strikes swept the nation in 1980.
   The official PAP news service reported absenteeism only slightly
higher than normal at the 10,800-worker shipyard Thursday.
   All but six of 38 people arrested when police broke up a strike
at the Lenin steelworks in Nowa Huta in southern Poland on May 5
have been ordered freed, said Jan Rokita, a Krakow-area Solidarity
activist.
   The six still under arrest were strike committee members, said
Rokita. He said they are accused of leading an illegal strike,
punishable by up to three years in prison.

<HEAD>Stealth Bomber Now Estimated to Cost $450 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force's planned Stealth bomber has
risen in cost to an estimated $450 million per plane, making it the
most expensive aircraft ever built, The Washington Post reported in
its Sunday editions.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified U.S. officials, said the Air
Force has told a few members of Congress that its fleet of 132
Stealth bombers will cost at least 20 percent more than projected.
The Northrop Corp. is building the planes.
   At the same time, the Stealth fighter, which is flying, has been
kept in production under a secret deal worked out by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Post
said.
   A Defense Department spokesman, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, had no
comment on the report.
   The bomber fleet's advertised price tag, in fiscal 1981 dollars,
has jumped from $36.6 billion to $43 billion. When expressed in
1989 dollars, which accounts for inflation since 1981, the cost has
risen from $50.6 billion to $59.5 billion.
   The Stealth bomber is designed with a curvy shape and an
absorbent skin, which should enable it to evade Soviet radar for a
longer period than conventional aircraft, giving defenders less
time to react and knock the invader down.
   The bomber's estimated $450 million price tag, which some
analysts expect to go higher in the future, compares with the
estimated $278 million for the B-1B bomber and $136 million for the
C-5B giant transport.
   The Stealth fighters now in operation have some of the same
characteristics as the Stealth bomber but cannot fly as far or
carry as many weapons. The Lockheed Corp., which builds the Stealth
fighter, has been lobbying Congress to build a second group of the
planes to help fill the arms gap to be left in Europe when
medium-range nuclear weapons are eliminated under the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, according to
congressional officials who spoke to the newspaper.
   Nunn, in negotiations on the fiscal 1988 military procurement
bill late last year, persuaded his colleagues to authorize extra
millions to buy additional Lockheed Stealth fighters to replace
some that crashed, the paper said. But the money added to the
secret so-called ``black budget'' was for less than six of the
Stealth fighters and not for the new group of planes Lockheed
sought, the officials told the Post.

Electric Fence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old merchant marine retiree has
been charged with manslaughter in the death of a longtime neighbor
who died when she tried to free one of her pet dogs from the man's
electrified fence.
   He had put up the fence to ward off a marauding pack of dogs,
but it was not installed properly and contained a lethal strength
of electric current, police said.
   The victim, 73-year-old Bertha Augusta Brittingham, was buried
Friday. Although a neighbor managed to free her from the fence, Ms.
Brittingham was dead on arrival Tuesday at a hospital in Cambridge.
   James Joseph Kahl, who for many years had lived next door to Ms.
Brittingham in a rural Dorchester County area, is free on his own
recognizance pending a court hearing on a date to be set.
   He declined Friday to discuss the death, other than to say it
was a difficult experience and that he has removed the electric
fence.
   Police said that when Kahl put up the 20-foot-long electric
fence, he failed to install a regulator that would have sent
pulsating current through the wire, instead of a steady flow of 110
volts that killed the elderly woman.
   ``That amount of voltage could kill anyone. It's like grabbing a
metal lamp with a frayed wire and not being able to let go of it,''
said Roger L. Layton of the Maryland State Police.

   For the children of Robert F. Kennedy growing
older means becoming more involved in the government, in their
communities and in remembering their father.
   ``By taking us to Senate hearings, to political rallies, to the
playgrounds he built for ghetto children, he taught each of us that
participation in public affairs was worthy and honorable,''
36-year-old Kathleen Kennedy Townsend says of her father in the
June issue of Life magazine.
   Mrs. Townsend, who lost a 1986 congressional bid, is the
director of a Maryland program for teen-agers.
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, 35, who holds the Massachusetts
congressional seat once held by his uncle, President John F.
Kennedy, has sponsored legislation for the homeless and for
increased involvement by banks in community programs.
   ``The rich,'' he says, ``can take care of themselves, but the
ordinary, hard working Americans can't afford the basic necessities
of living in the U.S. today.''
   Robert Kennedy Jr., 34, teaches environmental law at New York's
Pace University and is a lawyer for enviromental-protection groups.
   Courtney Kennedy Ruhe, 31, serves as treasurer of brother
Joseph's 1988 re-election campaign and is a member of the JFK
Library board. She also heads fund-raising for the RFK Memorial.
   Michael Kennedy, 30, is president of the Citizens Energy Corp.,
a Boston company founded by Joseph to supply inexpensive fuel and
prescription drugs to low-income families.
   Kerry Kennedy, 28, serves as executive director of the RFK
Memorial Center for Human Rights, which supports the work of
political activists around the world.
   Christopher Kennedy, 24, is a leasing agent at a family-owned
trade center in Chicago and devotes time to raising money for a
food bank.
   Douglas Kennedy, 21, a college student, is a member of the
Community for Creative Non-Violence and works with the homeless.
His 23-year-old brother, Maxwell, is also a college student.
   RFK's youngest child, 19-year-old Rory, is a college student who
has been arrested for protesting against South Africa.
   ``I guess my interest stemmed from numerous discussions at the
dinner table about South Africa and its relevance to what my father
believed and protested against when he went there in 1966,'' she
said.

   Some are angry, others are sorry. But all of the
people caught up in the ``zero tolerance'' crackdown at the
U.S.-Canada border walk away without their car or truck.
   Many also have had to pay on-the-spot fines ranging up to $1,000
as their cost of the new attitude of the U.S. Customs Service
toward drugs _ even small amounts _ at the border crossing.
   Since March 21, 103 people have been arrested, 244 vehicles
seized and one boat taken because any amount of drugs were found,
Dan Holland, district U.S. Customs Service director for Washington
state, said last week.
   Every Thursday the victims of the crackdown can be found at U.S.
District Court hoping to reclaim their vehicles.
   One Canadian citizen complained that customs inspectors laughed
as they seized his $45,000 1988 Porsche at Blaine, Wash. Inside the
car was a gram of marijuana, enough to fit in the palm of a hand.
   Another said customs inspectors used tweezers to remove the .1
of a gram of marijuana _ enough to fit on the end of a finger _
discovered at the bottom of her purse.
   A third held for six hours after his arrest said: ``The only
people they stopped and inspected were people wearing jeans and
jean jackets. No one wearing a suit was stopped.''
   All three commented after the court session Thursday only on
condition that they not be named.
   ``It's down to almost the ridiculous,'' said Michael Martin, a
federal public defender representing some ``zero tolerance''
victims in the Northwest.
   ``I spent all day doing `zero tolerance' cases. I have serious
felony cases pending, and this takes away from my ability to handle
those cases. The impact in time is enormous, but the impact on
these individuals (defendants) is horrendous.''
   Lawrence LaDage, chief customs agent in Seattle, says there's no
room for flexibility.
   ``We're hoping the word will get out: Leave your dope at home or
knock it off,'' said LaDage.
   ``There is a lot of remorse, a lot of amazement _ the
realization that maybe this is serious after all,'' LaDage said.
``Mostly, it is utter disbelief. You have a brand new Trans Am ...
and all of a sudden you are walking.''
   Approximately 60 cases have gone through the federal court in
Seattle. Each involved a misdemeanor count of possession of a
controlled substance _ mostly marijuana _ and one felony count of
importing a controlled substance.
   In each case, the defendant pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor
count and was placed on a year's probation; the felony count was
dismissed, said Peter Voelker, criminal supervisor at the court.
   In a minority of cases to date, customs has assessed owners of
vehicles sizable fees to recover their impounded vehicles. The rest
will be sold at auction, LaDage said.
   Federal public defender Thomas Hillier said court-appointed
attorneys are recommending their clients go along with the guilty
pleas.
   ``The government has a hammer in the sense that nobody in their
right mind wants to go through the hardship of a criminal trial,''
Hillier said. ``You risk a felony conviction on the notion of
fighting for the general principle of the thing.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Syrian army warned Sunday that it
will move into Beirut's devastated southern slums with
shoot-to-kill orders and demanded that warring Shiite Moslem
militias halt their 10-day-old bloodbath.
   More than 7,500 Syrian troops and about 500 tanks and armored
vehicles massed around the labyrinthine slums, where 18 Western
hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by factions
linked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The Syrian troops include two battalions of elite Special Forces
commandoes, Syrian and Lebanese military sources said.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence commander
in Lebanon, told the pro-Syrian Amal militia and Hezbollah to lay
down their arms.
   Asked when the Syrians would make their move into the
16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and cement-block houses,
Kenaan said: ``This is our decision. We'll decide the right
moment.''
   He warned: ``Our forces will shoot without hesitation any gunman
on the street or in buildings.''
   As Syrian troops surrounded the slums, dozens of families were
seen fleeing in convoys of bullet-scarred cars, packed with clothes
and blankets.
   Since intense fighting broke out May 6 between Amal and
Hezbollah, police say most of the slum's 250,000 residents have
fled. At least 211 people have been killed and 586 wounded.
   Lebanon's Interior Minister, Abdulla Rassi, told The Associated
Press that the Syrians ``are going to enter the suburbs in a day or
two, but I'm not setting deadlines.''
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
branded Syria's military buildup ``an act of intimidation.''
   He said ``all the suburbs will be destroyed if the Syrians
attempt to enter by force,'' indicating that Hezbollah, which has
fielded around 3,000 hard-core fighters, would resist the Syrians.
   Shell blasts echoed across the capital as Kenaan spoke at a news
conference in west Beirut.
   Police said Hezbollah and Amal militiamen were locked in
artillery duels, but they had no reports of overall casualties.
   In one incident, police said a shell hit the fourth floor of a
10-story building crowded with Palestinians in west Beirut's
Sanayeh district, killing a baby and two adults and wounding four
other people.
   ``It was imperative for Syria to take the decision to rescue the
people from this bloodbath,'' Kenaan declared.
   ``So orders have been issued to the Syrian Arab forces to enter
the southern suburbs and enforce security in the enclave.''
   He added: ``We call on the gunmen in the suburbs to lay down
their arms ... and warn them, without exception, of the
consequences of firing a single bullet at our forces.''
   Kenaan cut off a reporter who asked whether the Syrians would
seek to free the foreign hostages. ``There is a disaster in the
area. People are suffering distress that we will try to end,'' he
said, without elaboration.
   The Syrian decision to commit its troops into what could
deteriorate into house-to-house fighting underlined the failure of
Amal, the Syrians' strongest Lebanese ally, to crush Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah's fighters have seized control of the slums in 10 days
of savage fighting with Amal, which is led by Justice Minister
Nabih Berri.
   When the fighting began, Hezbollah held about one-third of the
district that borders Beirut airport.
   Kenaan declined to say whether the Syrian decision to move into
the slums was taken in coordination with Iran.
   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old gulf war
against Iraq.
   But that alliance, which is increasingly crucial to Iran after a
string of military setbacks and growing political isolation, has
come under strain in recent months.
   Syria considers neighboring Lebanon its sphere of influence. It
has been alarmed by Hezbollah's drive, with Tehran's blessing and
financing, to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the largest
single sect in the country.
   The Syrians moved 25,000 troops into north and east Lebanon
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   They also deployed 7,500 troops in west Beirut in February 1987
in an effort to end three years of militia anarchy. But, despite
bombings and kidnappings, they have not until now sought to move
into south Beirut.
   The Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio said, without naming a
source, that the hostages are now held in the basement of the
Iranian embassy in a seaside neighborhood outside the battle zone.
   ``This report is untrue. It's absolutely baseless,'' an embassy
spokesman said. He declined to be named.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine reported earlier that the
captives were moved during the fighting from an exposed Hezbollah
barracks to the home of Hezbollah spokesman Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin
in the less vulnerable Haret Hreik neighborhood. The report could
not be verified.
   Police said most of the 250,000 people who lived in the slums,
mostly poor Shiites, have fled since the fighting erupted.

   Yannash Scott was having a hard time
staying awake, but the 15-year-old was keeping a vigil with his
mother and other relatives of hostages held 300 yards away in Mack
Alford Correctional Center.
   ``I'll beat you, Mom, if I keep this up,'' he said. He showed
his mother his watch to make the point that by early Sunday morning
he'd already been up 26 hours. His father is one of the three
prison guards held hostage by about 20 inmates since late Friday
night.
   The teen didn't flinch when his mother said he'd have to keep it
up at least another day to beat her personal record, set some time
ago, of 56 hours without sleep.
   ``I'll make it 57, just to show you,'' he said playfully.
   But it's a bet he'd gladly lose if he could just see his father
and return home.
   ``I never thought this would happen to dad, not my dad,'' the
boy said. ``I wish they'd let him go.''
   There had been little word for relatives of prison guard Ronnie
Scott or fellow hostages Harold Yoder and Lewis McGee. Prison
officials have said the three are in good health and have not been
injured, but little else is known.
   ``It's really aggravating, sitting here waiting,'' Yannash said.
   Yoder's wife, Carolyn Yoder, was also among those keeping the
vigil on the lawn outside where the hostages were held. Six family
members of hostages waited through the early morning, sitting on
lawn chairs, blankets and cushions.
   ``When they had anything to tell us during the day, they would
come over with it,'' Mrs. Yoder said, referring to prison
officials' behavior Saturday. ``I've got no complaints about that.''
   Later, however, Mrs. Yoder would joke to a friend after not
hearing from prison officials until several hours after sunrise
Sunday that ``I knew I'd have to read the paper to find out what
was going on in there.''
   Tempers flared a bit as the group talked among themselves
through the pre-dawn hours. Rick Oumstead, a nephew of one of the
hostages, couldn't believe the prison's warden, Ted Wallman, hadn't
met with some of the women in the group.
   ``I don't know the warden, I never met him,'' Mrs. Yoder said.
``I know the chaplain. He's the one who comes out here to talk to
us.''
   ``What they ought to do is go in there with that special SWAT
team,'' she said. ``Those boys are smart enough to know what
they're doing. I'd feel a lot safer with them going in there to
take my husband.''
   The suggestion of the hostile prisoners being allowed to
transfer to a federal prison in El Reno angered the group. The
transfer idea was later rejected by the inmates.
   ``Why should they get to go to a federal prison?'' Mrs. Yoder
asked. ``I suppose so they can play tennis and have a swimming
pool.''
   ``My way of thinking, the ringleader ought not to be allowed to
walk away from this,'' Oumstead said.

<HEAD>Government Returns Press Credentials To American Reporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday returned the press
credentials of a Washington Post reporter after suspending them
last month when he reported Israel carried out the assassination of
a top PLO official.
   Government officials said Glenn Frankel, the Post's Jerusalem
bureau chief, had violated military regulations by not submitting
his dispatch to army censors.
   Yoram Ettinger, head of the press office, said the government
returned the press card after receiving a letter from Frankel
saying he was aware of military regulations.
   Frankel's credentials were suspended April 26 along with those
of Martin Fletcher of NBC, who also reported an Israeli role in the
assassination of Khalil Wazir, military comander of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was slain April 16 at his home
in Tunis, the Tunisian capital, by a group of commandos. Israeli
sources have confirmed Israel carried out the attack but the
government has refusd comment.
   Ettinger said the government would keep Fletcher's credentials
until completing an investigation of another NBC story on a planned
army incursion into southern Lebanon on May 2 hours before the
operation began.
   ``We decided that until the issue of the Lebanon story is
resolved, we cannot return Fletcher's card,'' Ettinger said.
   Frankel said he was pleased his card was returned but that he
and his paper did not regret their actions.
   ``We stand by what we did. It was an important story,'' he said.
``We think the government's action was a mistake and we are glad
they rectified it.''
   Under Israeli law, journalists must submit reports relating to
security matters to military censors. The government has not
clearly defined security, however, leaving the submission of
reports to the journalists' discretion.

than a quarter of an inch in the period.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also extended from northern
Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia to western Virginia and West
Virginia.
   Rain also was scattered over the coast of the Carolinas and
northeast Minnesota.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 43 degrees at Grand
Forks, N.D., to 98 degrees at Glendale, Ariz., and Needles, Calif.
The nation's low Sunday morning was 25 degrees at Lake Yellowstone,
Wyo., and Houlton, Maine.
   Rain and thunderstorms were forecast to stretch Monday from New
England and the Great Lakes to the Appalachians, Kentucky and the
Tennessee Valley, and showers were expected in the Pacific
Northwest. Skies were forecast to be generally sunny over the rest
of the nation.
   Highs were predicted to be in the upper 50s and the 60s over
much of New England and across the upper Great Lakes; in the 60s in
the Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; in the upper
80s to near 90 over the Gulf States; and in the 90s to near 110
degrees from inland portions of southern California through the
Southwest deserts. Highs were forecast in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   A police officer who helped in the arrests
of 64 anti-abortion protesters over the weekend has resigned,
saying that as a devout Methodist he felt his career was hurting
God's work.
   Joe Daniels, 31, a detective in the child protection unit and a
10-year veteran of the police department, said he had no other job
lined up and that he considered his resignation an act of penance.
   that he considered his resignation from the police department an
act of penance.
   ``I've failed God miserably,'' Daniels said Saturday, adding,
``By carrying out my sworn duty an officer, I realized I was
helping abortionists ply their craft.''
   Daniels said he has always opposed abortion, but hadn't
considered leaving the police department until he was arresting
some of the approximately 150 anti-abortion protesters who blocked
entrances to the Mississippi Women's Medical Clinic.
   He said 64 of the protesters were charged with trespassing,
including the leader of Jackson's Right to Life group, nine pastors
and three doctors. Many of the protesters spent several hours in

<HEAD>Robert Redford Presents His ``Miracle'' Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Redford presented the latest film
he directed, ``The Milagro Beanfield War,'' at the Cannes Film
Festival Sunday after showing a selection of his films in three
Soviet cities.
   Speaking at a news conference, Redford said he had been told the
response to ``Milagro'' had been very strong in Soviet Georgia.
   ``Maybe its because they feel isolated from the rest of the
country there,'' he said.
   The film is not entered in the competition at the Cannes
festival, but Redford said he came to Cannes ``because the film is
very important for me and I was in the neighborhood.''
   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' is about the inhabitants of
Milagro, a small town in New Mexico, and a resident who diverts
water from a real estate development to irrigate a patch of his
land.
   Redford, known for his interest in environmental issues, said
the cultural aspect of the story attracted him.
   ``The rampant development that's going on in the U.S. should be
questioned,'' he said. ``But there is also the need to preserve a
400-year-old culture.''
   He said he was aware of the Hispanic tradition in the United
States having grown up in a Mexican community in Los Angeles.

   Two Israeli helicopter gunships fired
rockets at Palestinian guerrilla positions on the outskirts of the
southern Lebanese port city of Sidon Sunday night, according to
police.
   They said at least three people were wounded.
   The police said an Israeli gunboat cruised off Sidon's
Mediterranean coast as the gunships rocketed the Palestinian
positions near the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army comand issued a brief statement
saying the pilots of the gunships reported accurate hits on the
targets and the craft returned safely to their base. It gave no
other details.
   Israel radio quoted Lebanese broadcasts as saying two helicpters
fired four rockets at two building in the refugee camp. It said
Israeli warplanes flew over the area after the attack.
   Sidon-based reporters said the helicopters dropped parachute
flares as they swooped in for the rocket-firing runs at about 10
p.m.
   By police count, it was Israel's 9th air raid on Lebanon this
year. Police said that in the previous strikes 49 people were
killed and 72 were wounded. The last attack was on May 12.

   Iraq claimed its warplanes hit another
supertanker off Iran's coast Sunday, and Tehran accused the U.S.
Navy of jamming radar and radio to aid Iraqi jets in a devastating
raid on a key oil terminal.
   Also Sunday, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said the
wreckage of a U.S. helicopter that disappeared after heavy
U.S.-Iranian fighting last month was recovered along with the
bodies of its two crewmen.
   Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency quoted a military spokesman
as saying that Iraqi fighter-bombers attacked a ``large naval
target,'' its term for an Iranian tanker, during the night.
   There was no independent confirmation of that raid, the 11th
claimed by Baghdad in 17 days.
   The Iranians vowed revenge on the United States for Saturday's
Iraqi raid on the Larak oil facility in the Strait of Hormuz. Five
tankers, including two of the world's largest, were left in flames.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Prime Minister Hussein Musavi as branding the
Americans ``international hoodlums.''
   Speaking after a Cabinet meeting in Tehran, Musavi said
President Reagan is ``gradually pushing the U.S. to a war which
will make the Persian Gulf an American graveyard,'' IRNA reported.
   The London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said the
bodies of 17 seamen were recovered and that three other crewmen
were missing from Saturday's raid. Earlier, it had said up to 50
crewmen might have been lost.
   Four of the ships were badly damaged in the long-range air
strike on the terminal in the southern Persian Gulf.
   In Madrid, shipping officials and newspapers said the
Spanish-flagged 235,000-ton supertanker Barcelona had sunk.
   But a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman, Lloyd's, and
gulf-based shipping executives all said the supertanker, severely
damaged by fire, had been run aground to keep it from sinking.
   The raid came as the Barcelona took on oil from the 564,739-ton
Seawise Giant, the world's largest vessel. The Seawise Giant, a
Liberian-registered tanker chartered by Iran as a floating storage
depot, was reported severely damaged.
   The other ships hit in the raid were the 152,004-ton
Cypriot-flag Argosy, the 231,712-ton Iranian tanker Khark, and the
457,841-ton British-flag Burmah Endeavor.
   The Iraqi air strikes are part of Baghdad's campaign to cripple
Iran's vital oil industry and force Tehran to negotiate an end to
the 7{-year-old gulf war.
   Larak serves international customers picking up oil brought down
the gulf by Iran's own shuttle fleet.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, on Sunday quoted a senior
Iranian air force officer who said that, as the Iraqi planes
approached their targets, ``the U.S. fleet began carrying out
electronic warfare against our planes,'' jamming Iranian systems
for nine minutes.
   U.S. military officials were not available for comment on the
claim. But two U.S. officials said Saturday that none of the U.S.
warships patrolling the gulf were involved in any way with the
Larak raid.
   IRNA reported that the Swiss Charge d'Affaires in Tehran, who
handles American interests, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
and handed ``a strongly worded protest note.''
   Gulf-based shipping officials said they had reports that the
Iraqi planes that raided Larak went in at low altitude to drop
parachute bombs, rather than using missiles, which have proved
relatively ineffective in many attacks on the huge vessels.
   Fires aboard the tankers were reported under control Sunday,
except on the Barcelona, where flames were still breaking out while
salvage tugs worked to put them out.
   In Madrid, Spain's Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordolez
called in Iraq's ambassador and ``energetically condemned'' the
attack on the Barcelona.
   Meanwhile, in the southern gulf, two salvage tugs and a large
floating crane were lifting what maritime sources said was the
wreckage of a U.S. helicopter gunship that vanished April 18, the
day the U.S. Navy clashed with Iranian warships.
   Maritime executives said the wreckage was found during the
weekend by a salvage tug in the area of the clashes.
   In Washington, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman,
confirmed the wreckage was located Sunday.
   He said the bodies of the two pilots _ Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33,
of Thomasville, N.C., and Capt. Stephen Leslie, 30, of New Bern,
N.C. _ had been recovered. They were the only American casualties
in the April fighting.
   Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed.
   The Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra disappeared hours after the fighting
in which the Americans destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank
or disabled six naval craft.

<HEAD>`Racehorse' Haynes Returns to Amarillo in Murder-for-Hire Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flamboyant attorney Richard ``Racehorse''
Haynes is back at the scene of one of his greatest legal triumphs.
   Eleven years after pulling off a stunning acquittal here for
former Fort Worth millionaire T. Cullen Davis, accused of killing
his stepdaughter and his wife's boyfriend, Haynes has returned to
defend Jane Ada Callaway, accused of masterminding the murder of
her boss' wife.
   Opening arguments were scheduled to begin Monday in a
large-capacity Potter County courtroom repainted for the trial with
money donated by Amarillo defense lawyers. Jury selection in the
capital murder case consumed more than a month.
   The Houston secretary's trial was moved here on a change of
venue from Houston, the same circumstances that in 1977 brought
Haynes to Amarillo from Fort Worth to defend Davis.
   To keep the lid on extensive publicity about the trial, Houston
State District Judge Michael McSpadden has issued a gag order
prohibiting attorneys and witnesses from discussing the trial.
   Haynes' challenge this time is to puncture a strong state case
against Ms. Callaway, charged with hiring a gunman to kill Judy
Saragusa on Sept. 2, 1987.
   Mrs. Saragusa's husband, Michael, was Ms. Callaway's boss and
the co-owner of a wholesale liquor distributorship. During pretrial
hearings, Saragusa admitted he had had an affair with Ms. Callaway,
but said it had ended two months before his 39-year-old wife's
slaying in the bedroom of the couple's mansion.
   The twice-divorced, 36-year-old Ms. Callaway is free on $50,000
bail and had to be ordered by a judge to stop telephoning her
former boss.
   After police identified a car seen leaving the murder scene as
belonging to Ms. Callaway, she signed a police statement saying she
had lent her car on the night of the shooting to Michael
Richardson, accused of being the middleman in the murder plot.
   Richardson's stepbrother, Leon Hawkins Jr., surrendered to
police two days after the shooting and told reporters, ``They made
me do it'' after being charged with capital murder.
   Richardson has agreed to testify for the state in exchange for a
10-year prison sentence, his attorney John Ackerman said last week.
   ``It's not an open and shut case, but it's a very good case,''
prosecutor Chuck Rosenthal told the Houston Post shortly after the
murder about the evidence against Ms. Callaway.
   Saragusa, expected to be another of the state's key witnesses,
is likely to be subjected to Haynes' famous cross-examination.
   Haynes' ruthless questioning of Priscilla Davis, Davis'
estranged wife, essentially put her on trial for her extramarital
affairs and drug use.
   Davis was acquitted of going on a 1976 shooting spree that left
Priscilla's daughter and boyfriend dead in Davis' $6 million
mansion, despite the testimony of three eyewitnesses identifying
Davis as the black-wigged gunman.

<HEAD>Bronfman: Western And Soviet Secret Services Knew of Waldheim's
War Past</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet and Western intelligence agencies knew
of Kurt Waldheim's World War II past but did not block his
selection as U.N. secretary-general in hopes of using him for
political gains, a U.S. Jewish leader said Sunday.
   Edgar Bronfman, president of the New York-based World Jewish
Congress, also said his organization gave the Soviets a list of
50,000 names of Nazi war criminals that were obtained from U.S.
files.
   Bronfman made his comments at a news conference after flying to
Jerusalem from Moscow, where he said he met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``It has become inreasingly clear that every secret service,
including the Americans, knew of Waldheim's war record,'' Bronfman
said.
   Waldheim, president of Austria since his election in June 1986,
served as U.N. secretary-general from 1972-1982. He has denied
allegations that he was involved in war crimes while serving as a
lieutenant in the German army in the Balkans during World War II.
   ``Everybody felt that they had something on Waldheim so he would
behave,'' Bronfman said. ``So it was agreed to let Waldheim become
secretary general of the United Nations.''
   Bronfman declined to say how he knew Western and Soviet
intelligence knew of Waldheim's war past and did not explain how
Walheim may have been pressured while U.N. secretary-general.
   An Austrian-appointed international panel of six historians
concluded in February that Waldheim knew about Nazi wartime
atrocities while serving in the Balkans in 1942-45. But the
committee found no evidence that Waldheim committed war crimes.
   In 1947, the Yugoslav government included Waldheim's name on a
list of suspected war criminals, but soon dropped a request to
Austria for his extradition without explanation.
   A British newspaper, the Sunday Express, asserted last year the
Yugoslav information left Waldheim open to Soviet bloc blackmail.
   The paper said it had a Dec. 12, 1947, memo from Uros N.
Djaelic, then chief of Yugoslavia's legal bureau, that detailed
what it called Waldheim's involvement in war crimes.
   The Sunday Exparess quoted the memo as saying: ``Waldheim, who
was responsible for hostages and contacts with collaborators ...
can be of value to the interests of Yugoslavia.''
   It quoted Anon Kolendic, the senior intelligence officer for
Yugoslavia in 1948, as saying he gave information on Waldheim to
the Soviet secret service.
   The paper reported a spokesman for Waldheim denied the
allegations.
   Another World Jewish Congress official, Ilan Steinberg, said
private investigators are now looking into Waldheim's activities on
the Russian front in 1941.
   Bronfman said his group gave the Soviets a list of 50,000 names
of suspected Nazi war criminals that were found in newly
declassified U.S. government files. He said the information was
passed on directly to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Cambodian authorities plan nationwide
marches during a ``Day of Hatred'' commemorating the massacres by
the former Khmer Rouge regime.
   The Vietnamese-backed communist government said the ``Day of
Hatred'' would be Friday and called on the people to make posters
condemning ``the savage crimes'' of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``Pledge to turn hatred into revolutionary activities in
building strong villages and communes, in building the armed
forces, and in intensifying attacks on the enemy to protect the
peaceful life of the people,'' the government said in a directive
broadcast by the official radio station over the weekend.
   It said the posters will be carried in processions to rally
points where tribute will be paid to the victims of the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist guerrilla group, defeated
the U.S.-backed Cambodian government in the spring of 1975 and
forced the evacaution of the country's cities, making the residents
go into rural areas to work. Millions of Cambodians were killed by
the Khmer Rouge or died of starvation and disease.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ousting the Khmer Rouge
and establishing another communist government.
   The government directive said the Khmer Rouge is attempting to
regain power by intensifying psychological warfare in the villages
and sabotaging peace efforts between Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of a resistance coalition that
includes the Khmer Rouge.
   It said that in the capital of Phnom Penh, a ceremony will be
held Friday at the former Tuol Sleng high school where 20,000
people purportedly were massacred. The building is now a ``museum
of genocide'' with photographs of thousands of victims and displays
of instruments of torture.

   The usually stoic Kentucky state medical
examiner couldn't fight back the tears as he told relatives of
people killed in a fiery church bus accident that they shouldn't
view the bodies.
   Before beginning his examination of the bodies that were piled
atop one another in the charred yellow church bus inside a Kentucky
National Guard armory, Dr. George Nichols went to the Holiday Inn
to speak to about 60 family members and friends who had made the
trip to help identify the dead.
   ``I want to tell them that the picture ... of their children in
that room is not what they have in their memories or wallet,''
Nichols told reporters before he left.
   But Nichols was moved as he met with the grieving in the motel's
banquet room, away from reporters.
   ``He was even crying along with everyone else,'' said a friend
to the parents of one of the victims. ``He's a very sensitive man
as far as that goes.''
   At least 27 people were killed when the bus was struck head-on
Saturday night by a pickup truck traveling in the wrong lane of
Interstate 71. The group was returning from an outing at Kings
Island amusement park north of Cincinnati.
   Ministers and Red Cross personnel were on hand Sunday to help
comfort and counsel the family members, some crying and others
stone-faced as if in disbelief.
   ``They're in shock,'' said Steve Watkins, youth minister at
Ghent Baptist Church, located about five miles from the accident
site. ``That's all I can say.''
   ``We're counseling and organizing the families to gather
information,'' said Marshall N. Eastham, a state police chaplain.
   ``The people are taking it as well as can be expected,'' said
Glenn Grubbs, a member of Radcliff First Assembly of God, where
most of the victims attended church. ``We're all still Christians.
   ``There's been a lot of praying and talking and grieving.''
   He said one of his friends ``lost his entire family (in the
accident). Obviously he's broken-hearted, but his faith is not
shaken.''
   The Rev. W. Don Tennison, pastor of the 600-member church, said
that some of his members were ``clinging to the hope that their
child is somewhere.''
   Tennison, whose son was on the trip but was unharmed, said he
was there to ``provide friendship, support and probably help them
work through some of the grief. It's going to take some time.''
   ``Everybody is in a state of shock, but they have a belief in
God to keep them going,'' said Tennison, who has been at the church
for about 10 years.
   ``We've been knocked down, but not knocked out.''

   Two gunmen entered a pub as
diners were finishing lunch Sunday and opened fire on the crowd,
killing three people and wounding six before fleeing in a
commandeered taxi, police and witnesses said.
   Ten people were taken to hospitals, six with gunshot wounds and
four suffering from shock, according to police.
   An anonymous telephone caller told the British Broadcasting
Corp. that the attack on the tavern patronized by Roman Catholics
was carried out by the Protestant Action Force.
   But a spokesman at BBC's Belfast office said the caller did not
give a recognized code used by the extremist Protestant Action
Force and the assertion could not be confirmed.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed and
predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, blamed the attack on
Protestant militants.
   The Avenue Bar on Union Street was preparing to close at 2:30
p.m. when the gunmen rang the bell and were admitted through the
electronically operated door, police said.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were
about 20 people in the bar when the gunmen entered and appeared to
be looking for someone.
   ``A guy came in and took his time looking around and then
started shooting,'' one witness said. ``Then the other one came in
behind him and started shooting at people. It was just
indiscriminate; people were trying to dive for cover but they had
no chance.''
   Police said two people died at the scene and the third was
pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. Moments after the
shooting, three priests arrived to administer last rites to the
dead.
   The gunmen had hijacked a taxi in the Protestant Shankill Road
area just before the attack and afterward drove off in the
direction of Shankill Road.
   Police and troops rushed into the area around the pub and set up
roadblocks. An army helicopter hovered above.
   Local people said the victims were from Unity Flats, Ballymurphy
and North Queen Street, all Catholic districts.
   The attack, the first of its kind in years in Belfast, fueled
fears of reprisals in the sectarian warfare that has ravaged this
predominantly Protestant British province.
   Tom King, Britain's secreatry for Northern Ireland, called the
killings a ``revolting outrage.'' Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
said the attack was ``an attempt at mass murder.''
   Both men appealed for calm.
   ``There is no place in a civilized society for people as
depraved as these killers and that holds true for anybody who has
ever raised a gun in Northern Ireland in pursuit of sectarian or
political ends,'' King said.
   ``One thing Northern Ireland does not need now is talk of
retaliation and revenge. Good sense and restraint are what is
needed.''
   Adams said, ``The area is very tense and local people are very
angry. I appeal for calm and discipline.''
   The Protestant Action Force is an offshoot of the Ulster
Volunteer Force. Both organizations are illegal.
   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, where Protestants
outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic
of Ireland.

   More than a hundred bird watchers spotted
a record number of species in the fifth annual World Series of
Birding, despite the adverse effects of a cold, wet spring on
migrations.
   The Zeiss Team, a New Jersey group led by Peter Dunne of
Bernardsville, spotted 200 species to beat 27 other teams from the
United States and Great Britain and capture the silver Urner-Stone
Cup.
   The bird watchers covered prime spots throughout the New
Jersey's marshes, woodlands and shores from midnight Friday to
midnight Saturday.
   Some teams traveled more than 400 miles during the contest,
which started at the Pequannock watershed about 40 miles northwest
of New York City and ending in the Cape May region in the south,
the state's best spot for night watching, said Paul Kerlinger,
director of the Cape May Bird Observatory.
   Dunne, who created the competition and was a member of the first
winning team, said this year's event was marred by a blustery
spring that slowed migrating patterns. Last year's winning team
spotted 205 species.
   ``There were no birds,'' Dunne said Sunday. ``It was silent
spring. It was cold and wet and birds just don't like those
conditions.''
   Dunne said the key to his team's success was that it ``just got
the meat and potatoes birds,'' including clutches of warblers and
kingfishers.
   Despite the poor spring, Kerlinger said contestants spotted a
combined total of 254 species, the best ever. The most striking
sighting was that of a sooty shearwater, an ocean bird rarely seen
from land, spotted off Cape May, he said.
   The obstacles weren't all natural. This year's runnerup, the
Woolrich-International Council for Bird Preservation from Britain,
sat through a two-hour delay on the New Jersey Turnpike during the
competition. They managed to spot 194 species.
   The event raised nearly $80,000 in pledges to conservation
groups, said Tom Gilmore, director of the New Jersey Audobon
Society.

   Pianist and composer Robert D.
Emmerich, who played with the Tommy Dorsey band and wrote songs for
Fats Waller, has died at age 83.
   Emmerich died Friday at Florida Medical Center, and a funeral
was held Sunday.
   Emmerich wrote more than 100 songs, including ``Beat It Out,''
``Woe Is Me'' and 10 others for Waller. He wrote ``Our Love,''
first sung by Dinah Shore, and ``No. 10 Lullaby Lane,'' introduced
by Kate Smith.
   Emmerich, who collaborated with Buddy Bernier and Joseph Meyer,
wrote a song called ``The Big Apple'' in the 1940s, said his wife,
Miriam.
   ``Walter Winchell liked it so much he started calling New York
`the Big Apple,''' his wife said.
   Emmerich also was a vaudeville, radio and night club performer.
   ``Bob was a self-taught piano player who couldn't read a note of
music, but he had some left hand,'' Mrs. Emmerich said.
   Emmerich, who was born in New York City, moved to Florida nine
years ago.

   British Petroleum has dropped its bid to drill for
oil next to a southern English forest where A.A. Milne conjured up
the immortal Winnie the Pooh more than 60 years ago, the Osberver
newspaper reported Sunday.
   It said the giant oil firm decided not to appeal the East Sussex
County Council's refusal to grant a test-drilling permit for the
area near Ashdown Forest.
   Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne, 67, was quoted as saying,
however: ``There never can be a total victory while it is
government policy to drill for oil regardless of what lies on the
surface.
   ``They will drill anywhere, except possibly under Buckingham
Palace.''
   In 1925 the Milne family moved from London to the Sussex County
woodlands, near Upper Hartfield village, which became the home of
Christopher and his Bear of Very Little Brain.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson called on graduating students to ``keep hope alive'' as he
paid tribute to his mother-in-law, who received her college diploma
here Sunday at the age of 61.
   Jackson also used the occasion to make an emotional pledge to
press on with his flagging campaign.
   ``I want to talk today about the challenge to keep hope alive _
of making it on broken pieces,'' he told students at commencement
ceremonies for predominantly black Hampton University.
   Among the graduates was Gertrude Brown, whose life of struggle
was movingly related by her son-in-law, Jackson.
   Mrs. Brown, who was an unwed mother as a teen-ager, worked full
time as she raised five children, including daughter Jacqueline,
the girl who would grow up to become Jackson's wife.
   Three of her children went on to receive advanced degrees. When
she was 49, Mrs. Brown decided her own time had come. She went back
to get her high school diploma and began her college education.
Still working full time, she painstakingly took one or two classes
a semester.
   A dozen years later, she reached her goal.
   ``She is of strong character, and she never surrendered. Against
all odds she is graduating today. ... That is what this graduation
is all about,'' Jackson said.
   Calling up images of determination and pride, Jackson invoked
the fight for civil rights.
   ``We worked through blood and smiled through our tears to get to
this juncture in the road. The struggle must continue,'' he told
the crowd. ``We must not surrender.''
   Jackson urged redefinition of the nation's priorities to help
the poor, homeless and powerless. He called for more taxes on the
wealthy and for U.S. allies to assume a greater share of defense
burdens.
   Jackson said he would remember his mother-in-law's example as he
campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I will never surrender to the odds,'' said Jackson, who lags
far behind the Democratic front-runner, Michael Dukakis. He led the
audience in a chant: ``Keep hope alive.''
   Jackson challenged the graduates to help care for those who
could not help themselves.
   ``I challenge our nation to do justice and to love mercy. We
must keep America strong, and make America better. How we relate to
the least of these _ the children in the dawn of life, poor people
in the pit of life, old folks in the sunset of life _ is a
measurement of our character,'' Jackson told the audience of more
than 11,000 at Hampton Coliseum.
   Jackson said as president he would double the federal dollars
spent on education.
   ``It makes more sense to invest in public education, day care
and prenatal care on the front side of life rather than jail care,
welfare and despair on the back side of life,'' he said.
   He also called for raising the minimum wage, working to bring
women's wages in line with those of men, and providing universal
health insurance.
   Later Sunday, Jackson addressed New Jersey Democrats, who were
holding their state convention. New Jersey's primary is June 7, the
same day as California's.
   ``I haven't inherited any voters,'' Jackson told the group.
``I've earned every vote I've gained.''

   About 4,700 United Rubber Workers members
struck Firestone Inc. plants in six states Sunday, and another
15,000 union members are poised to strike Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Co. at noon Tuesday.
   The Firestone employees walked out after negotiators in
Cleveland failed to reach an agreement prior to a 12:01 a.m. Sunday
deadline.
   ``There are no talks scheduled at this point and there is no
indication of when new talks could occur,'' Firestone spokesman Jim
Strandberg said Sunday.
   The disabled Firestone facilities are in Akron, Ohio;
Noblesville, Ind.; Des Moines, Iowa; Decatur, Ill.; Russellville,
Ark.; and Oklahoma City. The Des Moines, Decatur and Oklahoma City
plants make tires, the Nobelesville plant makes molded rubber
products and the Russellville plant makes innertubes.
   In Des Moines, about 20 Firestone employees picketed the plant's
five gates Sunday afternoon even though no work shifts were
scheduled until 11 p.m., said Bill Winslow, a production worker and
picket captain.
   ``There won't be any vulgar language, no open drinking, no
harassing the people who want to cross the picket line, no throwing
things,'' Winslow said. ``We've got a good image and we want to
keep it,'' he said. ``Firestone has already got their image, don't
they?''
   At Firestone's tire plant in Oklahoma City, about 10 workers
were on a picket line, said Don Adams, vice president of Local 998.
   As the Firestone strike began, a vote Sunday by a local in
Danville, Va., threatened to produce an even larger nationwide
strike Tuesday against Goodyear.
   The Goodyear pact was negotiated as an agreement to serve as a
pattern for other rubber companies. But Goodyear's 15,000 URW
members rejected the tentative contract by a 3-1 ratio on May 1.
   Fewer than half of the 1,668 members of Local 831 turned out for
the secret ballot Sunday on whether to take another look at the
proposal. The vote was 476-339 against reconsidering, union
officials said.
   ``If nothing changes, if the union and the company don't get
back together at 12 o'clock Tuesday, high noon, there will be a
strike,'' said Linwood Saunders, president of the local.
   Six of the 11 Goodyear locals approved the pact, but did not
represent a majority of the Goodyear membership in the URW. Under
URW bylaws, ratification must be made by a majority of the locals
representing a majority of the membership.
   URW President Milan Stone said Firestone's latest proposal did
not match the pattern settlement.
   ``(Firestone) did not present us with anywhere near a pension
offer that was negotiated (with Goodyear). They did not present to
us the cost of living allowance provisions Goodyear granted and
there was no provision in there for fully paid hospital
insurance,'' Stone said.
   ``These are the three issues that are very dear to our hearts,
and we will fight to keep those and that's why we're on strike,''
he said.
   ``We're willing to meet at anytime...The next move is up to them
when they want to get back together,'' Stone said.
   Firestone officials defended their proposal as fair.
   ``We are deeply distressed that the union has taken this
action,'' George W. Aucott, Firestone's executive vice president,
said in a statement. ``We believe that our proposal contains a
number of improvements, and in terms of Firestone's position in the
industry, is equal in value and in cost to the URW settlement
proposal.
   ``We are hopeful that the union and company negotiators will be
able to resolve their differences quickly, allowing the plants to
get back into operation,'' he said.

   Two explosions ripped through the dining
room of a downtown hotel used by foreign relief workers and six
people were killed, the hotel manager and doctors said Sunday.
   In another incident in Khartoum Sunday, waiters at a club
frequented by Westerners said they heard shooting near the entrance
of the building but they did not know who had fired the shots or
why.
   ``All of us just went under the tables,'' said one waiter.
   Earlier in the day the new five-party Cabinet of Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi was sworn in by the Supreme Council.
   In Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported the Khartoum
airport was closed as of 9 p.m. Sunday (3 p.m. EDT), one hour after
the explosions at the hotel, to all incoming and outoing flights.
It gave no details.
   Cairo air traffic controllers said they received a notice from
Khartoum authorities about the closure but the notice said the
action did not apply to Sudan Airways and it would continuie its
scheduled flights. The controllers said no reason was given for the
closure.
   Tahnassis Pagoulapos, manager of the Acropol hotel, said in a
telephone interview that the explosions occurred during the dinner
hour at 8 p.m. He said he did not know what caused the blasts.
   Doctors at a nearby hospital said the victims were two men, two
women and two children and all were whites. They refused to give
further details.
   Police declined to comment on the incidents and ordered
journalists away from the hotel and club.
   The swearing in of the 27-member Cabinet ended a month of
negotiations to include for the first time Sudan's main Moslem
fundamentalist party.
   El-Mahdi's centrist Umma party has 10 miniters, the centrist
Democratic Unionists six, the Moslem fundamentalist National
Islamic Front five and a grouping of southern parties five. One
portfolio went to the Sudan National Party, which is based in the
western Nuba mountains.
   El-Mahdi, appointed prime minister May 6, 1986, said the
portfolios were distributed among the parties according to their
representations in the Constituent Assembly, Sudan's parliament.
   The pro-Western prime minister had resisted including in his
government the National Islamic Front, which formerly was called
the Moslem Brotherhood.
   His previous Cabinet resigned April 16.

   A man was charged with killing an
81-year-old widow seven years after the crime because the paperwork
for his arrest apparently was misplaced.
   The body of Anna Jordon was found Feb. 5, 1981. She had been
raped, beaten and strangled and her 19-inch black-and-white
television set was stolen, police said.
   Rickie Eugene Brown, 28, was held without bond over the weekend
on a first-degree murder charge.
   Brown's stepfather, Larry Donnell Brown, has been on death row
in connection with Mrs. Jordan's murder since 1982. An accomplice,
George Dudley, received a life sentence after testifying that
Rickie Brown raped Mrs. Jordan and Larry Brown killed her.
   Police and prosecutors said they were surprised a warrant had
never been issued for Rickie Brown. The oversight was discovered
recently and St. Petersburg police began looking for him a week ago.
   After he was picked up, Detective Ralph Pflieger said Brown
admitted breaking into the woman's cottage and raping her.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II celebrated the largest Mass
of his South American tour Sunday with security provided by 20,000
soldiers and police after rebels set off explosions that plunged
parts of Lima into darkness.
   The pope later denounced the violence, poverty and other ills
that he said made Peruvian society seem like it was ``mined from
within.''
   An estimated 1.5 million people gathered in a park on the
outskirts of Lima, the nation's capital, for the outdoor Mass.
Hundreds of armed soldiers in full battle dress patrolled just
below the altar while helicopters flew overhead.
   The multitude chanted its welcome to the pontiff, greeting him
with a sea of yellow-and-white papal flags.
   John Paul, wearing white and gold vestments, appealed in his
homily for the building of a ``civilization of love.''
   ``A civilization, which, resting on this foundation of love for
the person who is near us _ our neighbor _ will transform ... the
whole world,'' he said.
   In an altar ceremony before the Mass, John Paul officially
closed the Fifth Marian Eucharistic Congress, a week-long meeting
of leading clergy from Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru
and Bolivia.
   The government news agency ANDINA reported that 3,327 people
were picked up by security forces in Lima in connection with the
pope's visit. It said they were detained ``on suspicion'' but gave
no other details.
   Officials said insurgents were responsible for four dynamite
blasts in Lima Saturday night shortly after John Paul flew in from
Bolivia.
   No one was injured in the explosions. One was set off close to a
bullfighting ring near a central square where the pope consecrated
a statue of the Virgin Mary.
   Rebels also bombed towers and power-relay stations in the Andes
mountains east of Lima Saturday night, causing brief blackouts in
the capital.
   Guerrilla violence by leftist groups has claimed more than
10,000 lives in the 1980s.
   After the Mass, the pope addressed Peru's Roman Catholic
bishops. He said Peruvian society often seemed ``mined from within
by an unjustified eclipse in the required respect for human
dignity.''
   He spoke of a ``blind and insensitive violence to repeated calls
to reconciliation,'' widening poverty, drug trafficking, and the
growth of sects and persistence of doctrines ``that create
confusion among the faithful and attack the unity of the church.''
   Before retiring for the night in the Vatican Embassy, the pope
spoke to a group of intellectuals and businessmen. He told the
intellectuals not to confuse the church's mission with ``mere
earthly goals or political action.''
   He admonished businessmen to improve their workers' living
standards but also defended them saying: ``Often it is forgotten
that you are men who confront risks ... and contribute to
technological advance.''
   Although the pope did not directly mention the problem of
guerrilla activity at the Mass, he did refer to a bloody prison
uprising by the Maoist Shining Path rebel group in a taped message
to inmates broadcast by Peruvian radio Sunday.
   The army killed more than 250 guerrillas in putting down the
revolt two years ago, and John Paul said, ``I know of the painful
tensions which have cost lamentable blood quotas, and I know of
your sufferings and needs, which in spite of noble and generous
efforts on the part of authorities, have not been overcome.''
   Troops and police in riot gear sealed off downtown Lima and
guarded public buildings and hotels.
   Heavy security was particularly evident when the pope paid a
morning call on President Alan Garcia in the government palace.
   As Garcia, a populist who has halted virtually all payment of
Peru's $15 million dollar foreign debt, led John Paul through a
garden, they passed two armored personnel carriers, soldiers
carrying Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns and a special
anti-terrorist team in red berets.
   From the palace, John Paul traveled in his vehicle, known as the
popemobile, to the Campo San Miquel Mass site, passing thousands of
cheering and waving people along the six-mile motorcade route.
   The pope was scheduled to leave Peru on Monday morning and fly
to Paraguay, last stop on his South American tour that began in
Uruguay May 7. He was due to return to Rome on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The New York City Ballet's three-week, $3.5
million American Music Festival, which concluded Sunday, presented
an array of new works of remarkably high quality, any of which
could enter the company's repertoire.
   The festival _ with old ballets and 21 new ones by 18
choreographers, all danced to American music _ has been a smashing
success, surely greater than the company expected. The New York
State Theater has been full for most performances and audiences
have been enthusiastic.
   The orchestra's playing has not always been top drawer. Of
course, they had 21 unfamiliar pieces of music _ five of them
commissioned for the festival _ to perform in three weeks, and much
of the music was modern and difficult.
   Dancers have looked outstanding throughout, even in pieces that
might have been allowed to slide through, like George Balanchine's
1954 ``Western Symphony.''
   The quality of the new ballets has been remarkably high. Since
Balanchine's death in 1983 it has been obvious the company needs to
add new works by a variety of choreographers. A festival, bringing
in a lot of new works in a short time, has proved a splendid idea.
Even choreographers who used Balanchine's neo-classic dance
vocabulary didn't create Balanchine clones.
   No premiere that we have seen couldn't enter the repertoire.
``Barber Violin Concerto,'' by Peter Martins, which used a couple
from the New York City Ballet and two guest artists from the world
of modern dance, was our favorite. Martins, who directs the company
along with Jerome Robbins, choreographed four of the new ballets.
   Of the five dances we saw for the first time on the final
weekend, we most liked ``Behind the china dogs,'' a highly original
ballet with distinctive, elliptical lighting, choreographed by
William Forsythe, artistic director of the Frankfurt Ballet since
1984. Forsythe chose well-muscled dancers. Solos looked crafted
specially for each soloist.
   Music was composed by Leslie Stuck on an electronic emulator,
which allowed ``a pack of dogs to jam with two string quartets and
a bowling ball.'' Some of the music and movement was jazzy and
amusing, unlike that of most of the other new ballets, which were
very serious.
   Violette Verdy, ballerina in the company from 1958 to 1977,
choreographed ``Set of Seven'' to 19th century Romantic-style piano
music by Mary Jean van Appledorn, head of the music department at
Texas Tech University. We liked the music better than the dance.
   Miriam Mahdaviani, who joined the New York City Ballet in 1980,
created a notable dance, ``The Newcomers,'' to music by David
Diamond. It's in neo-classic style and keeps a charming sense of
balance even when patterns aren't actually symmetrical. Five
soloists are introduced at unpredictable intervals through the
ballet instead of making the usual measured entrances. Holly Hynes
used striking colors for the soloists' leotards, contrasting with
the corps de ballet in white.
   Martins choreographed ``Tea-Rose'' in flowing balletic ballroom
style to five George Gershwin melodies that have never had lyrics.
Michael Tilson Thomas played piano and conducted. The final tune,
``Promenade,'' sounds familiar because Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers danced to it in ``Shall We Dance.''
   Martins also choreographed ``Black & White'' to music by Michel
Torke, in which eccentric hand gestures looked gimmicky, but then
this perception may have been caused by the viewer's ballet burnout.

   The bodies of two U.S. Navy pilots and
the wreckage of their helicopter were located in the southern
Persian Gulf on Sunday, the Pentagon said, nearly a month after
they disappeared during U.S.-Iranian clashes.
   The destroyer USS Merrill, two chartered tugboats and a seagoing
crane were sighted off the emirate of Sharjah, indicating an effort
to retrieve the wreckage was under way, maritime salvage experts
said.
   In Washington, Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman,
confirmed the wreckage of the Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra was located
Sunday.
   He said the bodies of the two pilots _ Capt. Kenneth Hill, 33,
of Thomasville, N.C., and Capt. Stephen Leslie, 30, of New Bern,
N.C. _ were recovered.
   They were the only American casualties in the fighting April 18,
when U.S. naval forces destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank
or disabled six naval craft. Iran said at the time that its forces
shot down the helicopter.
   Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed during the clash.
   The fighting began after U.S. forces earlier that day destroyed
two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for a mine explosion in
the gulf four days before that damaged the USS Samuel Roberts and
wounded 10 sailors aboard.
   The Navy had officially called off the search for the helicopter
and declared the men killed in action. Memorial services later were
held for the two Americans in Jacksonville, N.C., where their unit
was based.
   The wreckage was located by a chartered salvage tugboat, said
the salvage experts, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
wreckage was found in the general location where the raids
occurred, they said.
   The helicopter was on an evening patrol serving as backup for
U.S. combat ships the day it disappeared. It was dispatched from
the cruiser USS Wainwright.
   In their last dispatch, the pilots radioed that they had
detected hostile radar tracking their aircraft.
   The Iranians on April 23 claimed on their state-run radio that
their Revolutionary Guards retrieved the some of the wreckage of
the helicopter and brought it ashore.
   The death of the two men brought to 46 the number of Americans
killed in and near the Persian Gulf in the past year. The figure
includes 37 killed in an erroneous Iraqi missile strike on the
frigate Stark May 17 last year. The others were killed in
helicopter crashes.

   Neither Jesse Jackson nor Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had a clear majority of Alaska's Democratic
delegates Sunday following the state party's weekend convention.
   ``It was a negotiated settlement, is what it was,'' said Bob
Speed, executive director of the state Democratic Party. ``There
were two votes taken and both were very close. It had to be
negotiated from the standpoint of who got how many delegates.''
   When the dust settled, Jackson had seven delegates and Dukakis
had six. Four delegates were undecided.
   While Jackson won a strong majority of the delegates at the
Alaska Democratic Party's precinct and district caucuses in March
and April, Dukakis had a strong showing among the previously
undecided at the weekend convention.

<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan government boat
carrying 122 men, women and children docked at Limon on Sunday and
the captain and all but two of those on board declared themselves
refugees, a security official said.
   Captain Felipe Alvarado Castillo told Costa Rican authorities
the boat left Nicaragua's Caribbean port of Bluefields several days
ago, Carlos Jimenez, the security official, told The Associated
Press by telephone.
   He quoted the captain as saying the boat left to deliver food to
Corn Island, but that the passengers had decided to seek asylum.
   The refugees included 28 women, 35 men and 57 children, Jimenez
said.
   Jimenez said the boat had the identification number 20-INRA, but
he did not say how large it was. He did not say how long the boat
was at sea.
   It was not clear if the boat was stolen, taken with permission
for a trip to Corn Island and then diverted to Limon, 70 miles east
of San Jose, or obtained in some other way. Limon is 150 miles
southeast of Bluefields.
   Jimenez said two passengers, identified as Patricia Delgado and
Julio Antonio Vargas, were Nicaraguan government officials and told
authorities they wanted to return to Nicaragua. There was no
indication of what government jobs they held.
   During April and the first week of May more than 1,000
Nicaraguan refugees arrived in Costa Rica, an apparent increase
over previous weeks, rural guard officials say. Most walk across
this country's northern border at various points, particularly in
the northwest.
   More than 60,000 Nicaraguans have been registered as refugees in
Costa Rica since U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras began fighting
in 1981 to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government. An
estimated 50,000 others live in Costa Rica illegally.

   Neither Jesse Jackson nor Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had a clear majority of Alaska's Democratic
delegates Sunday following the state party's weekend convention.
   ``It was a negotiated settlement, is what it was,'' said Bob
Speed, executive director of the state Democratic Party. ``There
were two votes taken and both were very close. It had to be
negotiated from the standpoint of who got how many delegates.''
   When the dust settled, Jackson had seven delegates and Dukakis
had six. Four delegates were undecided.
   While Jackson won a strong majority of the delegates at the
Alaska Democratic Party's precinct and district caucuses in March
and April, Dukakis had a strong showing among the previously
undecided at the weekend convention.
   Many of those said they migrated to the Dukakis camp because he

protect them from suits resulting from their activities on the

<HEAD>Iron Range Taconite Industry Facing Rare Labor Shortage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The steel industry's hard-earned rebound
is reviving the taconite mines of the Mesabi Iron Range, where
skilled workers who were banished by layoffs years ago are suddenly
in short supply.
   The rare labor shortage has emerged as a call for help goes out
to ex-taconite workers who fled as far away as Arizona and Florida
during the industry's seven-year recession.
   They often are torn between remaining in their new jobs or
returning to northeastern Minnesota, where family ties run as deep
as the mine pits that helped fight two world wars by supplying ore
to the nation's steelmakers.
   ``People want to come back home,'' said Tom Gilpin, placement
interviewer for the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training in
Virginia, Minn. ``But I guess we've been burned so many times up
here, some of them just don't believe it's going to last.''
   Gilpin, who is taking applications for jobs at LTV Steel Mining
Co. in Hoyt Lakes, said some former employees who were called back
to work rejected the opportunity because they are secure in their
new jobs. But most miners _ some laid off for up to five years _
have returned.
   ``I'm glad to see it,'' said Ed Logan, 32, of Palo, who was
called back to work at LTV after being laid off nearly five years.
``I didn't think I'd ever get called back, but I guess I just kept
hanging in.''
   Logan said he eked out a living on the Iron Range working a
variety of jobs during his extended layoff. Being single helped him
avoid the fate of some of his married friends, many of whom were
forced to leave the area, he said.
   The decline of the taconite mines in recent years followed the
slide in steel production. Taconite is a flint-like rock containing
a low-grade iron ore that is extracted and converted into pellets.
The pellets are then shipped to steel plants for smelting.
   Iron Range taconite production peaked at 56 million tons in
1979, and fell as low as 23 million tons in 1982. Industry experts
estimate 40 percent of the $2.5 billion worth of mining equipment
in Minnesota, the nation's largest producer of iron ore, was idle
in recent years.
   Taconite production in 1988 is projected at about 40 million
tons, up from 31 million tons in 1987.
   Al France, executive director of the Lake Superior Industrial
Bureau in Duluth, said the six working taconite plants on the Iron
Range currently employ about 5,000 people, about 500 more than a
year ago, but well below the 1979 high of 15,000.
   Eldon Kirsch, District 33 president of the United Steelworkers
of America in Duluth, said the rebound has been made possible by
wage concessions and job consolidation.
   ``It's better now than it has been since 1980,'' Kirsch said.
``But that doesn't mean we have all our people back.
   ``Plants that operated with 500 in the past are operating with
300,'' he added. ``Where there were 2,000 workers, now 1,300 are
employed.''
   Most of the current hiring is taking place at the LTV plant in
Hoyt Lakes, where three shifts aim to produce 8.2 million tons of
taconite pellets this year, and at Eveleth Mines, where a second
production line is scheduled to begin July 1 after being idle since
1982.
   ``We're wide open right now for the first time since 1976,''
said Jim Kozar of LTV, president of Local 4108 of the United
Steelworkers of America.
   Kozar, Kirsch, Gilpin and others say there is an abundance of
unskilled labor but a shortage of electricians with mining
experience. Most Iron Range taconite producers ended apprenticeship
programs for electricians in the downturn and many of the laid-off
electricians have landed secure jobs in other places that they are
afraid to leave, they said.
   ``We're losing a certain number of them,'' said Bob Raich,
personnel director at Eveleth. ``The supply of technical and craft
people would be very, very short right now if you were to start up
a mining operation here.''
   Kozar said the scaled-back mining wage for electricians of about
$11.50 an hour isn't helping to attract the top unexperienced
electricians.
   Gilpin, the state labor official, said he has taken 3,200
applications for jobs at LTV, mostly from unskilled workers. He
said he has placed about 200 applicants.
   The ``off-the-street'' hiring is rare because it means the
company has exhausted its reserve of laid-off workers, Gilpin said.
   ``This is the first time they have come to us and said, `We need
your help,''' Gilpin said.
   Stan Daniels, president of Local 6860 of the United Steelworkers
of America in Eveleth, said it's a shock to see the mining
companies advertising in newspapers for workers and hiring
unskilled workers off the street. But it's a welcome sight because
it means that laid-off miners have had their shot at returning to
work, he said.
   ``Some of them have moved out, sold their places and they are
staying where they're at,'' Daniels said. ``But to others, there's
no place like home.''

<TEXT>
   After drifting through the shoal water of the
1980s and sometimes running aground, American steelmakers are happy
to have deep water finally under the bow.
   But where economic currents will carry them in the coming
quarters is an open question.
   ``Business is booming,'' said industry analyst Charles Bradford
of the investment firm Merrill Lynch & Co. ``Nobody sees anything
in their business that shows any sign of weakness, but they're all
worried about it because of what they hear from their economists.''
   The industry's prospects will dominate discussions at the
American Iron and Steel Institute annual convention on Wednesday
and Thursday in Washington, D.C.
   A combination of excess production capacity and slack orders
hammered the industry between 1981 and 1987: steelmakers closed
plants capable of making 30 million tons of steel per year,
eliminated about 220,000 jobs and sustained losses totaling about
$12 billion.
   In the process, they modernized remaining plants and bargained
new contracts, two steps which by some estimates halved the labor
needed to make an average ton of steel. The industry also persuaded
the Reagan administration to limit steel imports through quotas
negotiated with 31 countries.
   Now some plants are turning away orders ``because they don't
want to stretch out delivery times too long. Your customers tend to
get aggravated,'' said Wayne Atwell, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs.
   March shipments of 7.7 million tons were the most since June
1981 and were up 21 percent from March 1986. Previous estimates
that 1988 shipments would total 70 million tons could be
outstripped by 10 million tons.
   Some users can't buy enough metal.
   ``Just about everybody I talk to says they could sell more steel
if they could get it,'' Atwell said.
   USX Chairman David Roderick claims his company, the largest U.S.
steel producer, is now so competitive it could export more ``if we
had more product available.''
   Bradford doubts export opportunities are that bright, but none
of the analysts suggest that too many plants have been closed or
that the approximately 170,000 blue- and white-collar steelworkers
left on the job are not enough.
   ``If anything, people think there still should be more''
production capacity cut, Bradford said.
   ``The steel industry...lost an absolute fortune over the last
four or five or six years,'' Atwell said. ``They had to raise
prices to make a reasonable profit. If part of that means shutting
down capacity...to meet normal demand but giving up some business
at peak demand, then that's realistic.''
   Atwell said prices fell 15 percent over the five years after
their 1981 peak. Various estimates say prices now recovered from a
third to half of the decline, and Atwell expects prices to climb
another 4 percent to 5 percent this year.
   The industry turnaround, bolstered by the weakening of the
dollar, helped Bethlehem Steel Corp., for example, post a 1987
profit of $174 million, its first annual profit since 1981.
   The third-largest producer had lost more than $2 billion in the
interim and warned investors it might join second-ranked LTV Corp.
and smaller Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and Sharon Steel Corp.
in Chapter 11 reorganization.
   LTV, after losing $4.5 billion from 1983 to 1986, showed a
profit of $502 million last year and $163 million in the 1988 first
quarter. This month the company unveiled a tentative plan for
settling its $6 billion in debts and emerging from bankruptcy
protection.
   ``I see no reason at this point for this upturn in steel
producing fortunes to change in the months and the quarters
ahead,'' Roderick told USX shareholders this month.
   A general economic recession seems to be the industry's largest
worry. Many economists expect a downturn by late 1988 or in the
next year or so.
   Several analysts also are concerned large steel inventories
could lead to a drop in orders, weaker prices and profit problems.
   Peter F. Marcus of the investment firm PaineWebber says the
extraordinarily high production levels cited by National
Association of Purchasing Managers surveys are ``overwhelming
evidence'' that steel users are building inventory.
   Bradford cites the Steel Service Center Institute's recent
report of a record 6.8 million tons in inventory in March. The
institute's 400 members handle one-third of the nation's steel.
   But Andrew Sharkey, president of the institute, noted that daily
shipping rats also were at record levels.
   ``The market ... fundamentals are still pretty solid,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reports of Cabinet Rift Bring Pressure for Solution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's three leading Sunday newspapers reported
a serious split between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her
two most senior ministers over economic policy and said Mrs.
Thatcher was under party pressure to heal the reported rift.
   Aides to Mrs. Thatcher deny there is a split and insist the
prime minister has no plans to reorganize her Cabinet, the domestic
news agency Press Association reported after the Sunday Telegraph,
Sunday Times and Observer all headlined the alleged dispute.
   The papers said Mrs. Thatcher was in dispute with Nigel Lawson,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe, a former treasury chief, over the strengthening British pound.
   The pound has risen strongly since March, arousing concern that
the resulting higher prices of British exports would damage British
business and industry.
   The prime minister is opposed to further intervention to curb
the pound on the grounds that it is inflationary. Lawson advocates
a stable exchange rate, interest rate manipulation and central bank
intervention. Howe made clear last week that he favors British
participation in the exchange-rate stabilization of the European
Monetary System.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher is facing mounting pressure to move Sir Geoffrey
Howe from the post of foreign secretary if she cannot resolve her
seemingly intractable dispute with him, and Mr. Lawson...over
exchange rate policy,'' said the Sunday Telegraph.
   The Sunday Times, which like the Sunday Telegraph usually
supports the Thatcher administration, said senior members of the
governing Conservative Party were pressing Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson
to issue a statement denying there was a rift.
   No formal statement emerged, but Press Association quoted
unidentified aides as expressing Mrs. Thatcher's determination to
discount the reports of friction.
   It also quoted unidentified government officials as saying any
clear statement by the prime minister on exchange rate policy
likely would help speculators, and that government policy was to
keep the speculators guessing.
   The liberal Observer said Mrs. Thatcher was facing: ``A damaging
public row'' with Howe and Lawson. It also said the dispute had
renewed speculation that the Cabinet may undergo a shakeup this
fall and that Lawson might resign before the next budget is
unveiled, also in the fall.
   The Telegraph took the unusual step of running a front-page
editorial saying the dispute was not a crisis or a conspiracy but a
case of mismanagement that ``lies with Mrs. Thatcher's insensitive
behavior.''
   It said she had a tendency to antagonize senior ministers and
appealed to her to ``forget about being the Iron Lady for a change,
and start showing the human touch.''
   None of the papers attributed their reports, but aides to senior
ministers are known to brief the mass circulation Sunday press
extensively.
   The Telegraph's assistant editor, Bruce Anderson, wrote in his
column that Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson have managed to heal their
differences but that Howe remained on the outside.
   The newspaper cited Howe's comments last week suggesting Britain
should reconsider its reluctance to join the European Monetary
System, a mechanism for stabilizing exchange rates. Mrs. Thatcher
is known to oppose British membership.
   Last week, Howe reiterated Britain's intention to join the
monetary system when the time is right, but added: ``We cannot
forever go on adding that qualification to the underlying
commitment.''
   Anderson said, ``that remark was bound to bring Howe straight
into controversy,'' and said Howe and Mrs Thatcher often were at
odds on other foreign policy matters.

   A growing pack of sellers for every car buyer has
auto finance companies elbowing for advantage.
   Among the strategies being employed by the Big Three automakers
are speedy loan approvals via computer and special incentives for
new buyers, such as college students.
   Home equity loans, popular for home improvements, are being
offered to improve a house the auto company's way _ parking a new
car in front of it.
   And in some cases, loan terms are being extended, with one
European company offering a 10-year financing plan.
   ``Financing and pricing are the name of the game for about five
years,'' said Charles L. Shillingburg, analyst with the auto market
research firm of J.D. Power and Associates.
   General Motors dealers are among those installing computers to
get quick loan reviews from their credit subsidiaries.
   ``You almost get an instantaneous response _ the dealer does _
from us,'' said John Andrews, a spokesman for General Motors
Acceptance Corp., GM's financing arm.
   The system spits back approval or disapproval, and alternatives
such as different terms for different length loans, or lease
possibilities.
   ``I think it makes a lot of difference. You've got a customer on
the premises. The dealer has given his best sales pitch. You strike
while the iron is hot,'' Andrews said.
   Ford Motor Credit Corp. is about halfway to its goal of
installing computers in 3,000 dealerships, said executive vice
president Don Cook.
   For homeowners, GMAC says it will make credit available based on
customers' home equity. Interest on such a loan is tax deductible,
subject to restrictions relating to the original cost of the home
and improvements that have been made, said Sarah Wreford, Internal
Revenue Service spokeswoman in Detroit.
   Chrysler Credit is trying home equity loans on a test basis but
adoption is uncertain and numbers are ``really negligible at this
point,'' spokesman Bob Heath said.
   The financing scramble can only intensify, said analyst
Shillingburg. With Japanese makers stepping up U.S. production and
other manufacturers entering the market, the number of car models
available in the United States is expected to increase from the 163
available in 1985 to as many as 235 in 1992, Shillingburg said,
predicting Japanese companies will form credit subsidiaries.
   But the population only grows about 2 percent a year, and the
number of people owning three or more cars cannot be expected to
increase greatly, Shillingburg said.
   The market's maturity is one reason the Big Three are targeting
the college crowd to attract new buyers. GMAC, for example, is
offering graduates $400 in addition to rebates a model already
carries, and up to 90-day deferral of first payments.
   Cut-rate interest promotions are fading somewhat, because of the
cost to companies of absorbing the difference between low
promotional rates and the going rates for capital. But the impact
of those programs has ``set up a scenario of continuing
promotions,'' Shillingburg said.
   European makers, fighting price penalties that increased with
the falling dollar, are adopting that approach to push back into
the market. Peugeot Motors of America offered a $3,000 trade-in
allowance for Peugeot owners buying new 1988 Peugeot 505 models. In
March, the company expanded the offer to anyone owning or leasing
any make of vehicle.
   Volvo announced in February it was cooperating with Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York to offer up to 10-year financing through
Volvo dealers, at rates from 11.25 percent to 12 percent, depending
on locality.
   By Tuesday, there were still only about 100 takers on the
10-year loans, Volvo spokesman Bob Austin said.
   Austin said they are designed for buyers wanting to keep monthly
payments down, though they'll pay substantially higher total
interest over the term of the loan. A buyer might plan to make the
lower payments for a time and then sell the car for enough to pay
off the remainder of the loan, which carries no prepayment penalty,
Austin said.
   Mercedes Benz Credit Corp., headquartered in Norwalk, Conn.,
began a program of no-down-payment, four- and five-year leases in
the last week of March, Mercedes spokesman A.B. Shuman said in New
York.
   More dramatic are the free round-trip Lufthansa or Pan Am
airline tickets to Stuttgart that Mercedes offers buyers who take
European delivery of their cars.
   That offer is an attempt to revive the European delivery program
that dropped from 2,080 overseas deliveries in 1986 to 914 in 1987
as terrorist scares cut tourism, Shuman said.
   The customer pays a 2{ percent import duty, but tax, currency
exchange and other savings can amount to $3,000 to $8,000,
depending on the model, Shuman said.

   The manufacturing site for the Saturn
car lies between the towns of Spring Hill and Columbia, obscured
from view by a manmade rolling hillside bordered by a bright white
picket fence.
   After Saturn arrived, both towns annexed land as close to the
plant as possible, to take advantage of the housing and commercial
development that will follow the completion of a new parkway to the
plant.
   Despite their neighborly proximity, townspeople know little
about what goes on inside the compound. Saturn officials say the
town wanted them to place the plant out of view, while their
neighbors occasionally grumble that they are being intentionally
shut out.
   But Saturn is intended to be a mystery, a successful top-secret
weapon against import cars. General Motors Corp., which funds
Saturn as a subsidiary rather than a division of the company,
expects the plant to turn a profit immediately, said Laurie Kay, a
spokeswoman for Saturn.
   Almost a fourth of the plant has been completed since
construction began in June 1987. Saturn plans to offer a family of
Saturn cars _ subcompact and compacts _ in 1990 for the 1991 model
year, Ms. Kay said.
   State legislators who visited the sprawling site in March viewed
the half-completed powertrain building where car engines and
transmissions will be built. Construction also has begun on three
other buildings where cars will be assembled and painted before
rolling off the line.
   Part of the plan to make Saturn competitive with imports
involves approaching production work differently, and Saturn
officials _ along with their partners in the venture,
representatives of the United Auto Workers union _ are adopting
management techniques developed by the Japanese, said Ms. Kay.
   Employees will be involved in all aspects of production, from
understanding the cost of supplies to sales, she said.
   They will be on salaries rather than the traditional hourly wage
rates, with 20 percent of their pay based on the performance of the
company, Ms. Kay said.
   Saturn jobs will first be offered to the estimated 300,000 UAW
members who have been laid off around the United States by GM, said
Ms. Kay. About 6,000 people have applied for the 3,000 jobs that
are to be filled by mid-1989.
   The plant is designed to produce 250,000 cars a year initially.
GM plans to increase production, depending on the auto's reception
by car buyers.
   Saturn has begun reviewing about 1,700 applications for a
network of dealerships, which are expected to reach 123 cities by
the end of the first model year.
   Saturn has sent employees to Japan to study Japanese automaking
procedures, as well as to Germany, said Ms. Kay.
   ``We're looking very hard at everything. We're not inventing
everything,'' she said.
   ``We are taking a fresh look at what we do.''
