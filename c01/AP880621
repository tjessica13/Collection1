<HEAD>U.S.-Honduran Road Project Inaugurated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOCON, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials formally inaugurated a
6.8-mile stretch of road built in a six-month project involving
more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers and National Guardsmen.
   The American troops, who started the project Dec. 28, built a
road linking Jocon, a village in rural Yoro province, and Puente
Grande. About 200 Honduran troops also took part in the project.
   Honduran and American Army and National Guard units have held a
series of joint operations, with the U.S. forces being rotated in
and out of the country for brief periods of duty.
   The final report at a ceremony Monday marking the conclusion of
the road-building project said the U.S. troops also assisted 11,500
Honduran civilians and 8,000 animals in health and veterinary
programs.
   Gen. Frederick Woener, chief of the U.S. Southern Command based
in Panama, attended the ceremony.
   U.S. Embassy sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
another road-building exercise is planned in the summer of 1989 to
build 5.5 miles of road between Jocon and the village of San
Lorenzo.
   At least 60 joint military exercises involving U.S. and Honduran
forces have been held in the past six years.
   The program began after the Reagan administration claimed
Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista regime threatened other Central
American countries.

   A White House-sponsored conference on drugs
said Tuesday that legalization of drugs would be a ``profound
mistake'' and society should instead expand and stiffen measures
already in use, including screening in the workplace and imposing
the death penalty for trafficking.
   Such measures would include making the Department of Defense the
primary agency for air and sea surveillance of drug trafficking,
extending anti-drug policies to ``every employee in every private
and public workplace'' and stiffening mandatory penalties for
traffickers, including addition of the death penalty for drug
dealers who commit murder.
   ``The U.S. national policy must be zero tolerance for illegal
drugs,'' said the final report of the White House Conference for a
Drug Free America, established by President Reagan last year.
   ``The legalization of illicit drugs is not a solution, but
rather a profound mistake,'' the report said. ``To legalize drugs
is to make them more readily available, and as an inevitable
consequence more widely used, and this is simply unacceptable.
Illicit drugs are far too destructive to the health of our citizens
and the strength of our national character.''
   Included in the more than 100 recommendations are creation of a
drug czar with Cabinet rank, increased taxes on beer, wine, liquor
and tobacco to finance the anti-drug fight, and setting up a
National Drug Prevention Agency.
   ``Whether we are family members or co-workers of addicts,
passengers on airplanes or trains piloted by users, victims of
brutal and wanton violence induced by mind altering drugs,
travelers facing the menace of drugged drivers on our highways, or
simply taxpayers, we are all victims of illicit drug use,'' said
Lois Haight Herrington, chairman of the conference.
   Meanwhile, the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee
unanimously approved legislation to curb government seizures of
boats, cars and other vehicles under the ``zero tolerance''
anti-drug policy. The panel barred the seizures, whih have prompted
many complaints, unless there's evidence that the owners or
operators knew illegal drugs were present.
   Transportation Secretary James Burnley called the legislation
``an outrageous action'' that would ``gut'' the policy and
undermine efforts of his department ``to keep drugs off boats and
improve marine safety.''
   The drug report, which Herrington will present to Reagan next
week, stressed prevention and education and it earned this accolade
from Education Secretary William J. Bennett.
   ``We've heard a million proposals from a thousand people _ but
here is a comprehensive, tough and practical set of
recommendations. ... I applaud this report.''
   More than 5,000 people, including former addicts, entertainment
and sports figures, teachers, doctors, parents, students, judges
and prevention specialists, took part in six regional and one
national conference
   The report said the president should promote a ``strong,
straightforward, easy-to-understand policy that prevention is
essential to rid this country of its drug problem.''
   ``This policy must be backed by adequate funds,'' the report
said.
   It called for more spending in the criminal justice system and
the building of more prisons and said all people in custody should
be tested for illicit drug use.
   Penalties should be stiffened to include mandatory minimum
sentences for drug traffickers, those using youths to distribute
drugs and those selling to youth. Both adult and juvenile drug
traffickers should be treated as serious offenders and sentenced
accordingly.
   ``The drug lords of this world deserve our greatest
condemnation,'' the conference said. But while participants were
not unanimous on use of the death penalty, ``a clear consensus
emerged that no other sentence seems to be appropriate.''
   In the workplace, both public and private, the report said,
there should be a strong anti-drug policy that begins before a new
employee is on the payroll.
   ``Prehire mechanisms should include a clear written statement to
applicants that they will be subject to a drug test or a physical
examination that includes drug testing,'' the report said.
   The report cautioned that care should be taken so the screening
will be used only as a mechanism to prevent hiring of drug users.
   It also recommended testing ``for cause'' when accidents,
absenteeism or abnormal behavior indicate a potential drug problem.
And it advocated random testing ``whenever there is a need to
ensure that workers are beyond question fit for safe, healthy and
secure work assignments.''
   There are specific recommendations for a drug-free
transportation system, and for preventing drugs in sports. A
section on media and entertainment calls for avoiding the
glamorizing of drug use and for a movie rating system that would
take drug content into account.
   The conference was especially critical of the State Department
for giving the international war on drugs a low priority and for
assigning law enforcement activities overseas to diplomats.

<NOTE>EDS: Inserts 3 grafs after penultimate graf bgng: Foreign Minister

   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney disclosed
Tuesday that Canada expelled a group of Soviet diplomats last week
for ``improper and unacceptable behavior.''
   Canadian officials said 17 Soviet diplomats and trade
representatives in Ottawa and Montreal were either expelled or told
not to return in cases where they had already left the country.
   Mulroney made the disclosure at a final summit news conference
when asked about the expulsion by a Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
reporter, who sought confirmation that there had been expulsions
for industrial espionage.
   ``I will confirm the government of Canada took some action last
week in regard to the improper and unacceptable behavior by
representatives of the Soviet government in Canada,'' Mulroney said.
   He said Canadian security officers presented the government with
``rather delicate information'' and ``certain people were
expelled.''
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark will make a statement on the action
in Parliament on Wednesday, Mulroney said.
   The Canadian Press news agency, quoting unidentified sources in
Ottawa, said scientific and technological information was believed
to be the Soviets' main target.
   The agency said eight of the Soviets have left Canada since the
expulsion. Two of them worked at the Soviet embassy in Ottawa and
the others were based in Montreal with diplomatic status. The other
nine Soviets had left Canada in recent months. All were declared
persona non grata and told they could not return.
   Canadian Press said the expulsions appeared to have no
connection with the arrest last week on spying charges of Stephen
Joseph Ratkai, a Nova Scotian of Hungarian descent. Ratkai was
accused under Canada's Official Secrets Act with gathering
classified U.S. military documents from a submarine-tracking
station at Argentia, Newfoundland.
   Mulroney said that despite the summit's endorsement of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, Western leaders were ``under
no illusions'' about the Soviet Union.

   Four women testified Tuesday about horrors
they encountered in a basement torture pit where self-styled
minister Gary Heidnik chained them to pipes, raped them and used
the cooked remains of a victim as a warning.
   Lisa Thomas, who was 19 when she was freed from the torture
chamber in Heidnik's house more than a year ago, said Heidnik
pretended to be a police officer coming to the women's rescue, then
beat his captives when they screamed for help.
   Heidnik's attorneys are using an insanity defense.
   Ms. Thomas said she was abducted when she accepted a ride from
Heidnik and returned to his house for sex. When she wanted to
leave, he tried to strangle her, she said.
   Ms. Thomas told the jury, chosen in Pittsburgh because of
extensive publicity about the case here, that the 44-year-old
Heidnik also repeatedly raped his captives.
   Heidnik is charged with killing Sandra Lindsay, 24, who died
from asphyxiation while chained to a pipe, and Debbi Johnson, 23,
who was electrocuted while standing in a water-filled pit.
   He is also charged with repeatedly raping and torturing Ms.
Thomas and three others until police released them in March 1987.
   Surviving victims testified Heidnik said he kept them chained in
the basement because he wanted the women to have his children. They
said they were fed dog food mixed with human remains during their
captivity.
   Tuesday, Josephina Rivera, testified that Heidnik got the idea
from the black comedy film ``Eating Raoul.'' Ms. Rivera, who said
she was a captive for four months before escaping, said Heidnik
once took a protesting captive, Ms. Dudley, upstairs to show her
body parts as a warning.
   ``She said he had taken her upstairs and shown her Sandra's head
in a pot and her ribs in a roasting pan on the stove and her legs
and arms in the freezer, and that if she kept it up that's what was
going to happen to her,'' Ms. Rivera testified.
   Jacqueline Askins wept as she described the deaths of the two
women. As she left the courtroom and came before photographers, she
began screaming.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham called the five photographers
into court with the jury in recess.
   ``You people don't have any sensitivity at all,'' she said,
banning all cameras from the City Hall floor where the trial is
being held.
   During the gruesome testimony, Heidnik seemed to pay no
attention. He sat in the courtroom staring straight ahead, wearing
the same flowered black Hawaiian shirt and baggy trousers he wore
when first arrested.

<HEAD>Government Spokesman Offers to Quit for National Reconcilialtion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a
news conference Tuesday he is ready to resign if that would aid the
cause of national reconciliation.
   ``I think it would be to the advantage of national
reconciliation if I ceased to be government spokesman,'' said
Urban, who has been at his post in the communist government since
1981.
   ``My role, my person and my face are associated mainly with
political struggle,'' he said.
   But he added a final decision depended on his superiors.
   ``I am tied by certain special links of political
like-mindedness, loyalty and attachment (to the government) and in
view of this, the decision that Urban should go, in my opinion a
right one, cannot be made by Urban himself,'' he said.
   Urban is not a member of the Communist Party. He became
prominent through televised news conferences and statements in the
turbulence after Solidarity was chartered by the government in the
fall of 1980 as the only free trade union in the Soviet bloc.
Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed.
   As government spokesman many Poles have seen Urban as the bearer
of bad news, such as price increases.
   He once wrote a column for a satirical publication and also
worked for the weekly Polityka newspaper when Communist Party
Politburo member Mieczyslaw Rakowski was the editor. Rakowski is
now the party's propaganda chief.
   Urban has many critics but in 1987 readers of the magazine
Kobieta I Zycie (Woman and Life) voted him one of their men of the
year.

<HEAD>NPB _ Neutral Particle Beam</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Different from traditional laser beams, a neutral particle beam
has one bigadvantage for SDI use, scientists say: It can penetrate
objects and discriminate between real missiles and decoys.
   Theoretically, it can also destroy objects as fast as 10 per
second in space.
   The initial concept actually came from the Soviets in the 1970s.
It was picked up at Los Alamos National Laboratory and carried much
further.
   ``We don't think the opposition has anything like this,'' said
Stan Schriber, project director. ``This technology wasn't
understood theoretically until two years ago. It had been a mystery
in the scientific community for 10 years.''
   In a neutral particle beam, a stream of charged hydrogen
particles receives an added electron then is accelerated to great
speeds. Before release, the extra electron is stripped out,
creating a neutral beam, one unaffected by magnetic fields.
   A Ground Test Facility for an NPB is under construction outside
Schriber's office. It will be a prototype for a weapons system.
   ``If the funding stays, this could be deployed by the year
2000,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BEAR _ Beam Experiment Aboard a Rocket</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BEAR, a small neutral particle beam machine on a rocket, will be
here next year.
   Already under contruction at Los Alamos, the 44-inch-diameter
machine will be loaded onto an Aries rocket, launched from the
White Sands Missile Range on a sub-orbital flight and fired.
   ``The primary goal is to take one of these complicated things
into space _ it's never been done before,'' said Kenneth McKenna,
deputy project manager. ``We have to know we can operate in space.''
   The SDI command has accelerated BEAR's timetable so decisions
can be made on the most promising technologies, McKenna said. His
team is already working nights and weekends.
   While Schriber works to make a bigger NPB machine, to prove it
can be made powerful enough to destroy missiles, McKenna tries to
make it smaller _ to prove it can work in space. The technologies
would later be merged.
   ``I am very confident it will work when we get it up there,'' he
said.

<HEAD>PHASER _ Phased Array Experiment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At the Air Force Weapons Lab, researchers have combined laser
beams in a phased array. And instead of getting the sum of the
power of the individual lasers, they get much more.
   What they envision is a set of seven lasers in space that, when
combined, give the power of 49 lasers.
   ``We can make a small laser act as a big one and shoot down
missiles,'' said Air Force Lt. Dave Russell, electro-optics
engineer. ``You can't manufacture something great big and put it in
space. But you can put up a whole bunch of little ones.''
   In just four years of SDI work, the Air Force has combined three
lasers, produced the power of nine, and moved the beam from target
to target.
   ``We've got the basic idea in hand,'' Russell said. ``It's just
a matter of time before someone makes a decision to deploy or not.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PBFA II _ Particle Beam Fusion Accelerator II</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PBFA II is a merry-go-round-like contraption 108 feet wide with
36 arms arranged around a circular center. The Sandia National
Laboratories machine is designed to fire an ion beam at a target
pellet and ignite a nuclear fusion _ but it has yet to be done.
   By creating small nuclear explosions in the laboratory,
scientists say they'll be on the road to making fusion energy
available for commercial use and being able to test nuclear weapons
and materials in the laboratory instead of with underground
explosions.
   Fusion, combining two atoms, is the power of nuclear warheads.
Fission, splitting an atom, is the power of old atomic weapons and
of today's nuclear power plants. Fusion, if ever harnessed in the
laboratory, could yield almost limitless energy without as much
hazardous waste.
   At PBFA II, controllers sit in a small room fashioned after a
ship's bridge, with operators at screens labeled ``Commander
Spock,'' ``Capt. James Kirk,'' and ``Lt. Sulu.''
   ``We get closer to fusion every day,'' said senior technical
aide Guy Donovan.
   At full power, PBFA II's output would be 50 times the world's
existing electrical generating capacity for the extremely short
time it would be fired, billionths of a second.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GBFEL _ Ground-Based Free Electron Laser</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eighty acres of New Mexico desert have been cleared of sage and
brush for construction of a free electron laser, a machine capable
of firing a beam at the speed of light into space. Once up there,
the beam would be bounced off orbiting mirrors to intercept Soviet
missiles within minutes of launch.
   ``The technology is available today. The problem is getting it
to this level and this size,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Lloyd Young,
the assistant project manager.
   By 1995, the military hopes to conduct an experiment in space
with the GBFEL, but this year's funds were cut and work has been
delayed.
   Two kinds of free electron lasers are competing _ one at Los
Alamos, tied in with Boeing, and one at Los Alamos' sister
laboratory, Lawrence Livermore in California, which is working with
TRW.
   A choice will be made next year, Young said, on which beam to go
with.

<HEAD>R2P2 _ Rapid Retargeting Precision Pointing Simulator</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Already in operation at the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group
facility at Denver, R2P2 is a ground-based simulator that measures
how fast a space-based laser could retarget an object.
   The SDI contract, worth $20.9 million, specifies Martin Marietta
operate R2P2 for all ongoing Star Wars experiments for the next
three years.
   President Reagan toured the R2P2 simulator laboratory last
November.
   ``R2P2 is designed to duplicate the extreme precision needed to
track objects in space, a vibration-free environment,'' said
program manager Robert Sampsell. ``It is built on the most
seismically stable base on the North American continent, a rock
formation 28 miles long, 8 miles deep and a half-mile wide.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign arms sales have been a quiet source of
funds for China's military establishment in the 1980s, but for the
government the deals can be a political minefield.
   No sooner did controversy die down over China's surprise sale of
medium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia than reports circulated that
Beijing was selling missile technology to Argentina and Pakistan,
and that Pakistan used the technology to produce a missile capable
of carrying nuclear warheads, which would be a threat to India.
   All sides denied the reports, but they highlighted China's
growing role as an international arms merchant with increasingly
sophisticated wares _ and seemingly few scruples about the buyers.
   A case in point is China's much-publicized sale of Silkworm
missiles to Iran after selling fighter planes to Iran's enemy, Iraq.
   Primarily a donor of small arms to African and Southeast Asian
revolutionaries in the 1960s, China has become the fourth largest
weapons seller to the Third World, after the Soviet Union, United
States and France, according to the U.S. government.
   China sold an estimated $1.5 billion worth of weapons in 1986
and about $2 billion worth in 1987, according to U.S. figures.
China does not release any figures, and Chinese officials refused
to discuss arms sales.
   China still lags far behind the world's leading arms seller, the
Soviet Union, which had 1986 sales of more than $15 billion. But
weapons make up an increasing share of Chinese exports, from less
than 2 percent in 1978 to more than 5 percent last year.
   For that it has mainly to thank the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. It
has sold $4.5 billion worth of arms to both sides, according to
U.S. government estimates, including the Silkworms to Iran that
gave China its first taste of political backlash.
   The United States last year briefly halted its program of
expanding high-tech sales to China to show its pique over the
Silkworms, with which Iran threatens Persian Gulf shipping. China
insists Iran gets the Silkworms from someone else.
   Iran in turn reportedly is unhappy over China's recent sale of
CSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia, substitutes for U.S. F-15 fighters
that the U.S. Congress blocked.
   The missiles have a range of 2,200 miles and can be fitted with
nuclear warheads. Iran, with which Saudi Arabia recently severed
diplomatic relations, is a logical target.
   Missiles and other sophisticated weapons still account for only
a small portion of China's arms sales, which consist mostly of
small arms and field artillery. However, its tanks and fighter
planes have become increasingly popular, especially since China
began upgrading them with British and Italian technology.
   Pakistan, a regular buyer of Chinese aircraft, replaces the
engines in them with British ones.
   Foreign sources who keep watch on arms deals say sales abroad
have helped fund weapons development for the Chinese military,
whose share of the state budget dropped from 17.5 percent in 1979
to less than 10 percent in 1986 as the government puts priority on
economic development.
   But China also is believed to be seeking influence and
recognition as an important player in world trouble spots, even at
the cost of criticism.
   China's main customers are developing countries embroiled in
regional conflicts and who don't want to depend solely on the
Soviet Union or the United States. Thailand, which buys most of its
arms from the United States, bought an estimated $10 million worth
of tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery from China last
year in part as a gesture of independence.
   Low prices, speedy delivery and simple weapons design that can
easily be maintained by low-tech Third World armies are other
attractions. The tanks China sold Thailand, for example, cost about
$200,000 each _ less than one-fifth the price of U.S. tanks that
Thailand bought a few months later.
   The Chinese tanks were delivered within months of order. The
U.S. tanks have yet to arrive.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here's a meaty question for students of
the Irish identity crisis: is it unchic to speak Irish?
   Bord na Gaeilge, the state language board, has published a
report suggesting that the Irish are losing respect for their
language, and with it their national identity.
   While the report names no names, the culprits aren't hard to
spot. They are Ireland's rising professionals and entrepreneurs:
the city slickers who think Irish is for yokels.
   ``They wouldn't be caught dead speaking Irish. They would think
of it as extremely uncool,'' says John Doyle, editor of In Dublin,
a trendy guide to events in the capital.
   Because Irish is spoken mainly in the rural west, ``it's
unfortunately seen as something non-urban, unsophisticated, as
something a lot of people perhaps would not like to be reminded
of,'' he said in an interview.
   Irish, or Gaelic as it is sometimes called, is the premier
official tongue and an evocative symbol of Ireland's struggle to
free itself of British rule and forge a separate identity.
   But English, the second official language, remains the
overwhelming favorite among the 3.5 million Irish, and only 5
percent to 10 percent still use Irish as their first language.
   Irish appears on pay phones, parking meters, road signs and rail
platforms. Official titles are Irish, like taoiseach (pronounced
TEE-shuck) for prime minister. Aer Lingus thanks its passengers in
Irish. In newspapers, letters to the editor often begin ``A
Chara,'' which means ``Dear Friend.''
   But usually, once the niceties are complete, English takes over.
The airline switches to English when pointing out the emergency
exits, and the letters to the editor also are in English.
   Some would say it was ever thus, given 800 years of British
rule. Douglas Hyde, the Gaelic scholar and future Irish president,
warned in 1891 that ``the Irish language is not dead but it is in a
bad state of health.''
   Now Bord na Gaeilge reports: ``Irish today, as 100 years ago,
appears to be in serious danger of disappearing as a community
language.''
   On the one hand it blames ``xenophobic nationalism and
vulgarized republicanism'' for co-opting the language to militant
anti-British causes.
   On the other extreme it chastises ``dominant elites'' in
business, the media and the professions who still regard Irish as
``a low-status `peasant' language'' and seek ``a way of escaping
from an identity of which they, perhaps, feel obscurely ashamed.''
   The result, says Bord na Gaeilge, is ``a certain emptiness in
the way Irish people now assert a sense of separate peoplehood, and
perhaps a lack of consensus over whether this is something worth
asserting at all.''
   It also sees a decline in traditional Irish accents on state
radio and TV, saying, ``many types of Hiberno-English are losing
respect in Ireland as non-Irish speech standards are increasingly
assumed among elites.''
   Some blame the government of Eamon de Valera, a founding father
of independent Ireland and zealous nationalist, which in the 1930s
made Irish an obligatory high school subject.
   No one could get a high school diploma without passing an Irish
test, and no one could join the civil service without a knowledge
of the language.
   The civil service requirement stands, as does the high school
requirement, although a passing grade is no longer required.
   ``A lot of people, when they think of the Irish language, think
of de Valera and the way Irish is rammed down their throats at
school,'' said Doyle, the In Dublin editor.
   Some experts say the preoccupation with Irish is holding back
Ireland's integration into European markets.
   Patrick Diggins, director of a Dublin teachers' center, called
in a recent speech for ``a severe jolt of realism.'' He said that
for the Irish to make their way in the European Economic Community,
``we must be fluent in at least two major European languages.''
   Some say the decline of Irish is inevitable as the struggle for
independence fades into history.
   The language, wrote Deaglan de Breadun, Irish language editor of
the Irish Times, has come to be seen ``a bit like an aunt who
seemed such an important person when you were small but now that
you are grown up you just find her amusing.''

   Western leaders saluted President Reagan on
Monday for his nuclear arms negotiations with the Soviet Union and
encouraged Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to pursue domestic
reform, saying it could ``reduce mistrust and build confidence.''
   The leaders of the seven major industrial democracies also
endorsed Reagan's call for tougher action to combat terrorism and
illegal drug trafficking.
   Specifically, they agreed that once a hijacked aircraft has
landed in a country, it should not be allowed to take off again.
Moreover, they called for international cooperation ``to trace,
freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb
money laundering'' through legitimate banking institutions.
   In a separate statement that cited violence on the Israeli-held
West Bank, the leaders called for a Mideast peace conference _ a
step which Israel opposes.
   Reagan and the leaders of Japan, Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy and Canada expressed their positions in a political
declaration on their second day of talks. A final economic
communique is to be issued at the close of their summit on Tuesday.
   Posing later with his colleagues for a group picture at the
University of Toronto's Hart House, Reagan was asked how he felt
about this being his eighth and final economic summit. ``I'm going
to miss them all,'' he said.
   The allies then engaged in a forceful discussion over dinner on
the environment in general and acid rain in particular _ an issue
pushed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The United States has rejected Canada's demand for scheduled
reductions in the smokestack emissions that cause acid rain.
   Urging Gorbachev to press ahead with more freedom and openness
in the Soviet Union, the summit leaders promised, ``Each of us will
respond positively to any such developments.''
   Holding out the prospect of increased trade with Soviet-bloc
nations, the summit leaders said, ``We take positive note of
Eastern countries' growing interest in ending their economic
isolation.''
   They also urged Eastern European nations to improve respect for
human rights, but did not link that issue to an expansion of
East-West trade.
   Officials emphasized a spirit of harmony at the summit and
played down any differences. ``There was no controversy involved
here,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.
   However, French President Francois Mitterrand objected to a U.S.
proposal for a task force to seek improved cooperation in the
battle against narcotics. Mitterrand said the seven summit nations
should not act as a kind of world directorate, with activities
outside the scope of their annual meeting, according to his
spokesman, Hubert Vedrine.
   Nevertheless, Mitterrand chose not to veto the language because
``the fight against drugs is too important for us to block progress
for whatever reason,'' Vedrine said.
   Reagan said he was pleased with the communique and felt that the
task force ``can help us win the war against drugs. And we're going
to win.''
   Looking ahead to the final communique, Treasury Secretary James
A. Baker III predicted there would be an agreement on a debt-relief
plan sponsored by France and Britain for sub-Saharan nations, which
he described as countries that ``have no reasonable prospect of
ever getting back on their feet.''
   Unlike other nations which have estimated how much debt relief
they would grant, Baker refused to provide a figure for the United
States.
   He cautioned that Latin American countries should not interpret
the action as a sign the United States was relaxing its insistence
that debtor nations adopt free-market reforms in exchange for
further lending by commercial banks and international lending
institutions.
   Until recently, the United States had been adamantly opposed to
debt relief for any countries, fearing that concessions to the
poorest countries would encourage big debtors such as Mexico to
expect similar relief.
   ``We have essentially an agreement,'' Canadian Finance Minister
Michael Wilson said of the proposals to aid the sub-Saharan
nations. ``All we have to do is work out some words of the
technical agreement.''
   Canadian officials said late Monday that Reagan's call for an
end to all farm subsidies by the end of the century was still on
the table.
   ``The situation is delicate,'' said one Canadian official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The discussions are very
intense. There may be the possibility of movement, and there may
not.''
   Baker was asked about reports that the West German central bank
would hike a key interest rate on Tuesday by 0.25 percentage point.
Rumors of such a move have sparked fears in financial markets in
recent days that the major industrialized countries were preparing
a coordinated round of interest rate hikes as a way of dampening
inflationary pressures.
   However, U.S. officials have denied such reports and maintain
that no round of interest rate hikes is likely even if the West
Germans do increase their repurchase rate, which is the rate of
interest that banks borrow from the West German central bank when
they use securities for collateral.
   Baker said the increase was a small one and was not a matter of
concern.
   On East-West issues, the leaders said nuclear weapons and
conventional forces are the best deterrents to war for the
foreseeable future.
   They hailed the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons (INF) and said, ``We now look
for deep cuts in U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive arms. We
congratulate President Reagan on what he has already accomplished,
along with General Secretary Gorbachev, towards this goal.''
   However, Reagan encountered some resistance over the pace of
negotiations with Moscow for cutbacks in long-range missiles,
bombers and submarines.
   On East-West ties, the statement said ``in several important
respects, changes have taken place in relations between Western
countries and the Soviet Union since we last met.''
   It credited Western strength and unity with fostering the
evolution.
   ``In the Soviet Union, greater freedom and openness will offer
opportunities to reduce mistrust and build confidence,'' the
statement said.
   Vedrine, the French spokesman, said the language reflected a
major change in tone from earlier summit statements. ``You can see
how far we've come in a few years,'' he said.
   Tempering the summit statement, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Reagan, while optimistic about changes in the Soviet
Union, was ``pessimistic about certain aspects of (Soviet) defense
posture, the overall adversarial nature of many Soviet policies.''
   The leaders also welcomed the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal
of troops from Afghanistan, insisting that ``it must be total and
apply to the entire country. The Afghan people must be able to
choose their government freely.''
   The leaders also said the presence of massive Soviet
conventional forces in Eastern Europe and the strength of the
Warsaw Pact forces lie at the core of the security problem in
Europe.
   Despite the picture of harmony displayed by the leaders, there
were some signs of disagreement, noticeably on the issue of
U.S.-Soviet negotiations to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by as
much as half under a new accord nicknamed START _ Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty.
   Reagan has said he would like to complete an agreement before he
leaves office in January but is not sure he can achieve it. White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``the other countries here
are interested in progress on START, some of them to different
degrees and with different emphasis.''

<HEAD>Farmer Hangs Self To Protest Opening Of Beef Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cattle farmer committed suicide to protest the
liberalization of Japan's agricultural markets just two days before
a pact to increase U.S. beef and other farm imports was signed,
police said today.
   Ikko Abe, 57, a farmer in Iwate prefecture (state) of northern
Japan, died after hanging himself on Saturday, but details of his
death were not released until today, said a police official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said Abe left a note saying, ``I oppose the liberalization of
beef imports. I will protest it with my death.''
   Abe owned 50 head of cattle and 2.47 acres of rice paddies, the
official said. Iwate prefecture is the fourth largest producer of
beef in Japan.
   Word of Abe's death came shortly before the United States and
Japan signed an agreement Monday under which Japan will nearly
double its imports of U.S. beef by 1991.
   Tokyo had sought to avoid opening its market to foreign imports
in order to protect its own farmers. As a major concession, the
U.S. agreed to temporary tariffs to soften the impact. Under the
new plan, Japan will establish tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60
percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993.

<HEAD>Maurice Sendak Teams With Robert Redford to Produce `Peter Pan'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Maurice Sendak says he hopes his
version of ``Peter Pan,'' the first production of a new children's
theater at Robert Redford's Sundance Institute, will not patronize
to its young audience.
   Sendak, whose wildly imaginative illustrations made his
children's book ``Where The Wild Things Are'' a classic, was
appointed artistic director to head the project under an $800,000
grant from the Eccles Foundation, Redford said Sunday at his canyon
resort.
   Other funding will come from AT&T and NBC, Redford said.
   Redford said he had long dreamed of creating a children's
theater and was encouraged by several professional writers,
directors and producers eager to work with him.
   Sendak, who has designed sets for ``The Nutcracker'' and an
opera based on ``Where The Wild Things Are,'' said his objective
was to produce honest, quality theater that children and adults can
enjoy.
   ``Good children's theater does not reduce or patronize,'' he
said. ``There is an unruly and tiresome 4-year-old in me.''
   Redford said the first production of ``Peter Pan'' is planned
for 1990.

   A 64-year-old man who said he was upset about
drug trafficking was charged Monday with murder after two elderly
neighbors in his senior citizens apartment building were shot and a
third was held hostage for several hours, police said.
   Nathaniel Mayo was accused of shooting two of his neighbors in
the head and leaving them for dead, police said.
   Assistant Police Chief Isaac Fullwood said the two women were
found in a third-floor hallway at about 9:30 a.m. A 65-year-old
woman was pronounced dead at the scene and a 64-year-old woman was
hospitalized in critical condition at The Washington Hospital
Center, Fullwood said.
   Another resident, Neva Williams, 75, was held hostage in
Williams' fourth floor apartment as officers evacuated dozens of
other residents from the 123-unit complex, police said.
   Mayo summoned WJLA-TV reporter Del Walters to the scene, and
Walters, who arrived about 3:30 p.m., eventually persuaded Mayo to
give himself up, officials said.
   Walters said Mayo claimed to have met him last week at the
District Building where he threatened to do ``something drastic''
if measures were not taken to stop drug trafficking in his
neighborhood. Walters said he only vaguely remembered the
conversation.
   Mayo told police Monday night that he has terminal cancer and
``nothing to lose.''
   According to police, Mayo lived in a third-floor apartment
adjacent to the apartments of the two women who were shot.
Neighbors said the dead woman frequently did Mayo's grocery
shopping.
   Police did not release the names of the two shooting victims by
late Monday, but residents of the building identified the dead
woman as Carrie Walls. The injured woman was identified by
residents as Emma Waldo.

   Wilford Leach, the Tony Award-winning director
of ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' and ``The Pirates of Penzance,''
and the principal director for the New York Shakespeare Festival,
has died of cancer. He was 59.
   Leach died Saturday at home, said Joseph Papp, who runs the
festival and who worked with Leach for more than 10 years.
   ``Wilford was my right hand and my left hand, too, because he
was close to my heart,'' Papp said. ``He really gave me such a
tremendous feeling of loyalty and understood the problems of
running a theater.''
   Leach came to the festival in 1977 as an associate director for
its Central Park production of ``Henry V.'' He stayed to direct
such other outdoor productions as ``All's Well That Ends Well,''
``Othello,'' ``The Taming of the Shrew'' and ``Twelfth Night.''
   ``The Pirates of Penzance'' in 1980 and ``The Mystery of Edwin
Drood'' in 1985 were first performed in Central Park and later
moved to Broadway for long runs. Leach won Tonys as best director
of a musical for both shows.
   Leach was a graduate of the College of William and Mary and
earned a doctorate in dramatic literature at the University of
Illinois. From 1958 until 1981, he was a professor of theater and
film at Sarah Lawrence College.
   Survivors include his mother, Louise and a sister, Doris.

   John E. Nidecker, a former special
assistant to former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, died
Monday of cancer at a hospital in this suburb of Washington.
   Nidecker, 75, died at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital.
   He became Nixon's deputy special assistant for congressional
affairs in 1969 and remained on the White House staff after Nixon
resigned in 1974 to work for the Ford administration until 1975.
   During an investigation of Korean influence peddling in
Washington in 1976, it was disclosed that Nidecker had received
$10,000 and other gifts from Korean officials in 1974. He turned
the gifts over to the appropriate authorities and he was not
accused of any wrongdoing.
   Nidecker became a lay brother of the Episcopal Church in 1975
and served as an assistant to the rector of a Damascus, Va. church
and was on the staff of a McLean, Va. church when he retired in
1984.
   The Philadelphia native was educated at the Marine Corps
Institute and LaSalle Extension University and served in the Marine
Corps from 1936-1940.
   He is survived by his wife Jeanne, sons Arnold and Stephen,
brother Arnold and three grandchildren.

<HEAD>NAACP Suits Against School District Dismissed in Favor of Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday agreed to dismiss
the country's largest desegregation suit, paving the way for an end
to the 25-year battle between the NAACP and the nation's
second-largest school district.
   The parties were given 60 days to work out a settlement before
the decision becomes final.
   The action ``arises out of the recognition that ... precious
little can be accomplished'' to desegregate a school system that
presently is just barely 17 percent white, said district counsel
Peter James.
   Grover G. Hankins, general counsel for the National Association
for Advancement of Colored People, said he was hopeful negotiations
would offer some substantial relief to minority students.
   The suit was first filed by the NAACP in state court in 1963,
and moved to federal court in 1981.
   In the mid-1960s, district enrollment was more than 55 percent
white. Today, however, 83 percent of the district's nearly 590,000
students are from minority groups. Hispanics at 56.8 percent form
the largest ethnic minority group, followed by blacks at 17.7
percent, Asians and Pacific islanders at 8.2 percent, and American
Indians at 0.3 percent. Whites make up 16.9 percent of the total
enrollment.
   Among proposals being considered to enhance opportunities of
minority students is the expansion of a one-year pilot program that
involved overhauling the administration and teaching staffs at
low-achieving, inner-city schools. That was accompanied by new
curricula with an emphasis on reading and writing.
   Some evidence has showed that the changes have brought higher
test scores, James said.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima's action would end the
largest desegregation lawsuit in the country after more than 20
years of costly legal battles.
   The NAACP alleged that the district illegally discriminated
against black students through its policies and actions. A state
court ordered the district to reassign and bus students to achieve
integration from 1978 to 1981.
   Mandatory busing ceased when voters approved Proposition 1 in
1979, which barred state courts from ordering busing as a remedy
for segregation.
   The anti-busing initiative would not prevent a federal court
from ordering busing, however, if it found the district in
violation of federal law.
   Since mandatory busing ended, the district provided a voluntary
integration approach, relying partly on ``magnet'' schools, which
offer specialized instruction and which must conform to ratios that
permit up to 60 percent to 70 percent minority enrollment.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration's grudging
enforcement of a 1986 law imposing sanctions on South Africa has
rendered the act ineffective at putting economic pressure on the
nation's apartheid regime, says a report by a private legal
advocacy group.
   In a report issued Monday, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law said the administration subverted the law's intent
by interpreting sections of the statute as allowing infusions of
money to South Africa.
   The report also said the administration ignored Congress'
direction to enlist allies in imposing a broad trade blockade
against South Africa.
   The report was released as the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee prepared to open hearings Wednesday on new and stronger
sanctions legislation. A similar bill is expected to come to a vote
in the full House soon.
   Both bills would place a virtual ban on U.S. trade and
investment in South Africa within a year. Backers say the United
States needs to escalate economic pressure on Pretoria to force
abandonment of its system of official racism.
   The legislation is given a good chance of passing in the House
but is likely to have a tougher time in the Senate, where it lacks
the support of moderate Republicans who gave the current sanctions
law crucial backing two years ago. The administration opposes the
bill.
   The 1986 sanctions, enacted over President Reagan's veto, banned
importation of South African textiles, agricultural products, iron
and steel and coal and uranium. They also prohibited new U.S.
investment and new loans to the South African government.
   The lawyers' report said the administration has allowed ``large
quantities'' of South African uranium to continue to be imported
into the United States in spite of the ban; allowed Ford Motor Co.
to pour $61 million into a South African company that was taking
over the automaker's operations there; and interpreted a ban on
exports of petroleum products to allow re-export from third
countries.
   Concerns that the sanctions would not be fully implemented by an
administration hostile to their intent have ``in part'' been
realized, the report found.
   ``Most troubling has been the administration's refusal to seek a
coordinated strategy with other industrialized countries'' to
impose multilateral sanctions, the lawyers' group concluded.
   ``This failure may have created the greatest limitation on the
potential impact of the sanctions,'' the report stated.
   ``Not only has the administration failed to comply with the
spirit of the law, it has actively worked to subvert and undermine
the efforts of other nations to achieve precisely the kind of
multilateral cooperation contemplated by the statute.''
   Gay J. McDougal, director of the study, acknowledged that
Congress' instructions on encouraging multilateral participation
were merely advisory and not legally binding, and that some
congressional supporters sought to pass a bill that would be more a
symbolic statement against apartheid than a real economic weapon.
   To remedy that shortcoming, the group recommended new
legislation to close many of the loopholes. It also recommended a
series of new sanctions that closely resemble the pending
legislation sponsored by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEAD>Banks With Aggressive Behavior Pursue Risky Course</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks that pursue ``growth for growth's sake''
are embarking on a risky course that makes it more difficult for
them to withstand economic downturn, a federal bank regulator says.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said Monday that
banks that lend conservatively more easily pull themselves out of
trouble than institutions with ``overly aggressive behavior.''
   ``Growth for growth's sake, or growth without the resources to
back it up, is a highly risky strategy because it leaves the bank
exposed when the economy turns down,'' Clarke said in a speech
Monday night to the American Bankers Association's Stonier Graduate
School of Banking in Newark, Del.
   ``In other words, when the economic tide goes out, you find out
who is swimming naked,'' Clarke said in a text of his speech that
was released in Washington.
   Clarke's comments came as the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, which regulates 4,500 nationally chartered banks,
released a report showing that problem banks that later recover are
more than twice as likely to comply with the instructions of bank
examiners as are institutions that fail.
   The report found that poor policies, planning and management
were about as likely to play a significant role in the failure of
closed banks as in the decline of banks that later recovered _ 90
percent and 88 percent respectively.
   However, the ``rehabilitated'' banks were much more likely to at
least partially comply with regulators' orders, 86 percent versus
41 percent, after financial weaknesses are first spotted.
   The recovered banks were also more likely to change chief
executive officers than failed banks, 90 percent versus 76 percent.
   Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, said bank
examiners have taken note of the study's findings by looking more
closely at the management practices of banks, even if they have
good earnings.
   But she said Clarke believes the comptroller's office does not
need additional enforcement power to reduce bank failures. She said
the agency prefers to work with bankers to improve their practices
rather than adopt a punitive attitude.
   The study is being issued as bank and savings institutions
failures have hit a post-Depression high. A record 184 commercial
banks _ half of them in the oil-drilling states of Texas, Louisiana
and Oklahoma _ were shut down by regulators last year. Failures
this year are running at about the same rate.
   Many S&L failures in particular have been attributed to
``high-flyers'' who pay high interest rates to attract deposits by
mail from all over the country and then sink the money in high-risk
real estate deals and oil drilling ventures that later go bust.
   In January, Clarke released the first phase of the study,
examining 171 nationally chartered banks that failed between 1979
and 1987. It showed that in most cases it took a combination of bad
management and a poor economy to cause a bank to fail. Only 7
percent of the failures were attributed to the economy alone.
   The findings raise questions about how banks outside the
Southwest will fare if the national economy enters a recession next
year or in 1990 as most economists expect.
   The second phase of the study, released Monday, compared failed
banks to 38 healthy and 51 ``rehabilitated'' institutions of about
the same size and in roughly the same areas of the country.
   Half of the healthy banks studied were in regions with depressed
economies, but they weathered the storm, the study said, because
``these bankers emphasized profitability and conservative lending,
even at the expense of growth.''
   The study said 74 percent of the failed banks pursued excessive
high-growth strategies, while only 16 percent of the healthy banks
and 40 percent of the declining banks that later recovered had such
strategies.
   In fact, all of the banks that dug themselves out of a hole
abandoned fast growth on their way back up, the study showed.

   Crash tests on seven 1988 subcompact

Administration says.
   The Colt 4-door station wagon produced a head-injury rating of
1,354 on the driver side, the agency said Monday in releasing test
results for 10 vehicles.
   The previous high among subcompacts tested this year was the
Nissan Pulsar NX 2-door hatchback, which produced a head-injury
rating of 1,134 for drivers.
   The head-injury rating, based on data recorded by instrumented
dummies during a 35 mph frontal collision into a fixed barrier,
shows the likelhood of injury to the brain.
   So far this year 25 vehicles have been crash tested.
   NHTSA said the tests do not result in pass or fail scores, but
``provide comparative data for consumers to use in their vehicle
purchasing decisions when comparing vehicles of similar size and
weight.''
   The dummies were wearing seat belts during the test crashes.
   NHTSA said new tests for two other subcompacts found the Honda
Civic DX 2-door hatchback produced a head-injury criterion of 787,
and the Daihatsu Charade 2-door hatchback, 768.
   Other new crash tests and the resulting driver head-injury
criteria were:
   Compact cars: Acura Legend LS 4-door, 435; and Nissan Sentra
4-door station wagon, 1,047.
   Large- and mid-size cars: Oldsmobile Delta 88 4-door, 710; and
Volvo 740 GLE 4-door, 519.
   Trucks, vans and multi-purpose vehicles: Dodge D-150 pickup,
685; Mitsubishi Montero 4x4, 1,320; and Nissan NL LEV pickup, 1,528.
   Only one vehicle of each model was tested, and NHTSA said
further tests on the same type of vehicle could produce different
results.
   The force of the 35 mph test crash equals a head-on collision
between two vehicles traveling at 35 mph, or a collision between a
parked vehicle and a vehicle moving at 70 mph.
   Previous crash tests on 1988 models produced these head-injury
criteria:
   _Subcompact cars: Toyota Corolla FX 2-door hatchback, 593;
Toyota Tercel 2-door hatchback, 1,005; and Volkswagen Fox 2-door,
1,114.
   _Compact cars: Nissan Maxima SE 4-door, 907; Peugeot 505 GLS
4-door, 701; and Pontiac Le Mans 2-door aerocoupe, 819.
   _Large- and mid-size cars: Ford Taurus 4-door, 707; and Mercury
Sable 4-door, 712.
   _Trucks, vans and multipurpose vehicles: Chevrolet Astro van,
1,603; Chevrolet C-1500 pickup, 892; Chevrolet G-20 van, 3,665;
Ford F-150 pickup, 1,074; Nissan Van XE, 949; and Volkswagen
Vanagon van, 1,320.

<HEAD>Drought Not Expected To Have Long-Term Effect On Farmland Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought is not expected to have a profound
effect on the recovery of farmland prices, although reduced cash
flow among farmers may thin out prospective buyers in some hard-hit
areas, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   ``I don't think we would see any particular long-term effect,''
said John Reilly of the department's Economic Research Service.
``Drought is a recurring thing in agriculture. Farmers expect good
years and bad years. When years are good they may forget a little
bit about the bad ones.''
   However, Reilly said that in the heart of severely hit areas the
drought ``may well impact land values'' by discouraging farmers
from expanding their holdings.
   A USDA report two months ago showed U.S. farmland values as of
Feb. 1 were up 3 percent nationally from a year earlier, the first
annual increase in six years.
   Reilly said in a recent interview and in a report in the
agency's Agricultural Outlook magazine that the patterns of the
past year indicate that farmland values will increase at about the
rate of inflation.
   The largest uncertainty, he said, is the direction that farm
programs will take, and their impact on financial returns to owners
of farmland.
   Programs authorized by the 1985 farm law are set to expire in
1990. The programs include a formula for gradually reducing
commodity price and income supports in hopes of making U.S. crops
more competitive on the world market and farmers less reliant on
federal subsidies.
   Even so, federal commodity program costs and payments to farmers
have been at record levels in recent years. Direct payments to
farmers rose to $17 billion in 1987 but are forecast to ease back
to around $14 billion this year.
   The 1985 law's shift to gradually lower supports and target
prices for major commodities through 1990 may have altered the
expectations of farmland investors.
   ``Thus, investors reasonably might expect farm program payments
to decline and, unless they foresee renewed strength in farm
product markets, particularly export markets, they will expect
returns to land to decline as well,'' Reilly said.
   Exports have improved, but few analysts expect a quick return to
the boom years of the 1970s. International trade liberalization
proposed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT,
also injects uncertainty into the outlook.
   ``When uncertainty rises, farmers may discount future income,
and make decisions as if they had lowered their expectations for
returns,'' Reilly said.
   Land values this year may increase modestly again, perhaps in
the range of 2 percent to 4 percent, he said.
   Overall, the recovery in the national land market will help
banks, insurance companies, and the Farm Credit System reduce
inventories of land acquired through foreclosures without adding
substantial additional losses, Reilly said.
   ``But potential buyers are likely to be wary about bidding land
prices up significantly, given the uncertainties that lie ahead,''
he said.
   In its annual review issued on April 14, the USDA agency
reported that farmland values, including buildings, averaged $564
per acre, up from a 19-year-low of $548 a year earlier.
   Despite the increase, the Feb. 1 average was still down 32
percent from the record high of $823 per acre in 1982.
   Reilly said in his report that U.S. farmland values historically
showed dramatic swings since national records began in 1850. Still,
land prices ``worked persistently upward'' after the Civil War
until they spiked during World War I, he said.
   ``Land values began falling after World War I and were pushed
lower by the Depression of the 1930s,'' Reilly said. ``But,
starting in 1945, values rose again, climbing with only minor
interruption for the next 35 years.''
   Government price support programs during the 1950s and 1960s
contributed to the rise, along with world food scarcities and the
export boom of the '70s, he said.

<HEAD>Actress Margot Kidder Has Waged Enthusiastic Campaign For Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To moviegoers, she's the Lois Lane of
Superman's affections. But to Jesse Jackson, she's a ``superwoman''
who has traveled the country this spring as an emissary of his
presidential campaign.
   Actress Margot Kidder devoted the better part of more than two
months to almost non-stop campaigning for Jackson, a man she can't
even vote for because she is a Canadian citizen.
   Kidder lives in the United States, along the Hudson River
outside New York, and feels strongly about national and global
politics. Aside from her acting, Kidder works with the human rights
group Amnesty International.
   Jackson, she said, ``is a man who is actually standing up and
saying all the things I always thought the Democratic Party stood
for.''
   Jackson has other high-profile celebrity backers, among them
Bill Cosby, disk jockey Casey Kasem and singer Holly Near. But
Kidder has been the most visible on a regular basis _ at times
traveling with the campaign and other times making her way to small
towns across the country where she was a surrogate speaker for
Jackson.
   Jackson introduced her from the stage as the campaign's own
``superwoman.''
   Kidder believes she was most effective when she spoke to groups
as a representative of the campaign, often appearing in small
communities. She says her celebrity status might have been the
initial draw, but the Jackson campaign was the main attraction.
   ``I feel I was most useful in the small towns and the small
community meetings where I was out on my own,'' she said in an
interview. ``I went from coffee shops to rallies, you name it ...
it was very inspirational.''
   Kidder, best known for her role as Lois Lane to Christopher
Reeve's Clark Kent in the movie ``Superman,'' says she has been
politically active since getting involved in California's nuclear
freeze movement in the early 1980s.
   Around that time, she first met Jackson at a peace rally, then
again briefly on the eve of the 1984 primary in California through
their mutual friend, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters.
   That year Kidder wanted to write an article for Vogue magazine
about the Democrats and followed the pre-convention action before
attending the party's San Francisco convention. She was attracted
to Jackson's foreign policy issues initially.
   ``I was present at the platform hearings and rules committee
hearings in '84, and was kind of aghast at seeing the attempts by
the party establishment to shut Jackson out,'' she said.
   Politicians who agreed with Jackson's positions ignored him in
belief he could not win, she said.
   She left the convention disillusioned with party politics, but
went on to campaign for liberal Democratic congressional candidates
across the country.
   Kidder said she found it disconcerting to speak to students who
were apathetic to politics or were supporting President Reagan
because they wanted to make a lot of money.
   She said she ``dropped out of conventional politics'' until
joining the Jackson campaign just prior to the April 19 primary in
New York, again, she said, at the urging of Assemblywoman Waters,
Jackson's state co-chair in California.
   Kidder scoffs angrily at the inevitable campaign plane rumors
that arise from her working relationship with Jackson.
   ``I find it really obscene that people cannot accept that a
woman who happens to be an actress and relatively attractive cannot
be accepted within a campaign as a valuable contributor without
something else going on,'' she said in denying the rumors.
   The mother of a 12-year-old daughter, Kidder said she related to
people she met as a mother and shared the impression Jackson had
made on her with his anti-drug message and his integration of
economic issues with domestic and global policies.
   But, she said, ``I hardly think Jesse Jackson needs Lois Lane
standing by him to give him credibility.''
   She plans to go to the Democratic convention next month in
Atlanta, where she said, Jackson's constituency has earned ``the
right to either be on the ticket or have their issues more than
paid lip service to in the platform.''
   Her other goal is to cement the Jackson coalition, the 7 million
people who voted for him, ``so that it has a firm place within and
with the Democratic Party.''
   Kidder says of her work for Jackson, ``I go to bed feeling like
I have done a little bit of meaningful work.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Seen By Some As Another Jimmy Carter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is not an unsmiling Jimmy
Carter, goes the joke. Dukakis has smiled once or twice.
   An editorial cartoonist recently depicted Dukakis with a
mouthful of Carter-like teeth. And, more pointedly, Dukakis was
drawn with a Trojan Horse _ in the form of a giant peanut.
   On the surface there are some similarities between the likely
1988 Democratic presidential nominee and the last Democratic
president.
   Both are or were governors of medium-sized states. Both sprang
to national prominence, still strangers to many voters. Both were
Washington outsiders. Both came lacking in foreign policy
experience.
   Whether the similarities run deeper is being debated.
   ``It's probably unfair to both of them, because the comparison
being drawn is designed to put Dukakis down,'' said James P.
Shenton, a Columbia University history professor who specializes in
governors.
   ``The presumption is that somehow Carter was a failure,'' he
said. ``I think Carter was a man who, as we move away from him, may
prove to be a somewhat better president than we realize.''
   Vice President George Bush, who as the likely Republican
presidential nominee expects to face Dukakis this fall, has talked
up the comparison to Carter.
   Faced with an ominous decline in the polls, and sensing he's
being hurt by recent Reagan administration problems, Bush would
love to frame the election as a referendum on the Carter presidency.
   Never mind that Carter's one term ended eight years ago. Bush
has been reminding people of the high interest rates, high
inflation, and perception of weakness that dragged Carter down.
It's a tactic Ronald Reagan successfully used against Walter
Mondale in 1984.
   ``It all sounds like Jimmy Carter reborn,'' Bush said recently
of Democratic views.
   ``We don't want to go back to the policies that the liberal
Democrats had under Jimmy Carter, that led us to those days of
malaise,'' he said on another occasion.
   So far there is no sign Bush is succeeding in selling the idea
that 1988 voters should base their decision on 1980. Polls suggest
voters are ready to move on to the post-Reagan years, and are
looking ahead to this election with interest.
   However, William Schneider, political analyst at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that there are
some similarities between Dukakis and Carter that go beyond the
superficial.
   Both Democrats, he says, share an approach to politics that is
different from that of more traditional Democratic candidates. Both
are regarded as ``technocrats,'' who see politics as a matter of
management rather than reconciling divergent interests.
   ``They're both problem solvers,'' he said. ``They both are
essentially running against the interests that run the show in
Washington. They both believe that political issues are technical
issues with right answers. And neither one of them has a strong
political base.''
   Lacking that strong base, Carter found few supporters when
things went wrong, such as the energy crisis or the Iran crisis, he
argues.
   Reagan, by contrast, had supporters who stayed loyal through
such controversies as the Iran-Contra affair.
   Schneider contends the Carter-Dukakis comparison makes sense to
voters, although they may not be able to put their finger on why.
   ``I think they have an intuitive sense that there's something
similar between Carter and Dukakis, in their view of politics,'' he
said. ``They're both kind of coldblooded, smart, not glad-handers,
and not comfortable with political give and take.''
   Others dismiss the comparisons.
   ``I don't think it's accurate at all,'' said Shenton, who has
studied the cases of governors who became presidents. Carter was a
more traditional and not particularly innovative governor, he
contends.
   Dukakis, a product of Massachusetts' political cauldron, was a
reformer who was turned out of office in his own party's primary
after one term, then regained office. He appeared changed by the
trauma of losing.
   ``Where the traditional name of the game is patronage, he broke
the rules, and in fact he lost his first re-election because he did
come in as a reformer,'' Shenton said. ``He's a person who has been
innovative in terms of the role of governor and the functions of
state government.''
   As for the lack of foreign policy experience and expertise on
the part of Carter and Dukakis, the same could be said of other
governors who became presidents. Shenton cited Reagan and Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
   He said gubernatorial experience can help in the White House.
   ``Governors have it going for them,'' he said. ``They have a
certain kind of basic awareness of how the government functions.''

<HEAD>Former CIA Officer Latest Charged in Iran-Contra Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former CIA official accused of participating
in an illegal conspiracy to arm the Nicaraguan rebels is the latest
person charged in independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's
broadening Iran-Contra investigation.
   Joseph F. Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa
Rica, was named Monday in a five-count indictment charging that he
and unidentified co-conspirators ``deceitfully and without legal
authorization'' organized a private arms supply network for the
Contras when Congress banned such aid.
   Fernandez, 51, who left the agency late last year after he was
disciplined by CIA Director William Webster, also is charged with
lying to his superiors to conceal the operation.
   In addition, he is accused of obstructing an investigation of
the Iran-Contra affair that was conducted by the presidential
commission headed by former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas.
   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to the Tower
Commission last year by stating that he did not know for a fact
that fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. North was
involved in aiding the Contras.
   Fernandez's attorney, Thomas Wilson, declined to comment on the
charges, saying he needed more time to study them.
   Each of the five charges carries a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The indictment shows that Walsh is continuing his grand jury
investigation even while preparing for the trials of North, former
national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers
Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   The judge in that case, Gerhard A. Gesell, indicated last week
he was ready to schedule a trial for North in U.S. District Court.
North and his co-defendants are to be tried separately on the
charges they conspired to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits
illegally to the Contras.
   The case against Fernandez was assigned to Aubrey E. Robinson
Jr., chief judge of the U.S. District Court here.
   ``The grand jury's investigation is ongoing,'' associate
independent counsel Laurence Shtasel, told reporters after the
indictment was returned against Fernandez.
   Shtasel also suggested that the 18-month term of the special
grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair be extended before
its scheduled expiration next month.
   The indictment charges that Fernandez helped North and Secord, a
retired Air Force major general, coordinate air drops of weapons
and supplies to Contra groups in southern Nicaragua in 1986.
   Fernandez, who operated in the field under the cover name Tomas
Castillo, also is accused of overseeing the construction of an
airstrip in northern Costa Rica that the conspiracy built to help
deliver arms to the rebels.
   The indictment charges that Fernandez lied to an official of the
CIA's Central American Task Force in September 1986 about the
purpose of the airstrip and later sent incomplete or unresponsive
cable messages to the agency in response to CIA queries about the
covert operation.
   The cables were designed to conceal the operation when the CIA
questioned Fernandez after a C123K cargo plane carrying weapons for
the Contras was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, the
indictment says.
   The indictment does not identify Fernandez's alleged
co-conspirators and prosecutors declined to do so either. But a
list of overt actions taken by the conspirators includes a June,
28, 1985 meeting in Miami between North, Secord and Contra leaders
Adolfo Calero and Enrique Bermudez.
   It notes that Fernandez exchanged messages with North and the
White House aide's associate Rafael Quintero over secure
communications devices supplied by North.
   He also met with Robert W. Owen, an associate of North, to
discuss construction of the airstrip, the indictment said.
   At the behest of North and Secord, Fernandez met with William
Haskell in late 1985 in the Costa Rican capital city of San Jose to
discuss the operation, according to the indictment.
   Haskell, a former Marine colleague of North's who went by the
pseudonym Robert Olmsted, helped negotiate the purchase of the land
for the airstrip, according to the report of the congressional
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Fernandez is accused of helping North and Secord coordinate air
drops of arms to the Contras in April 1986 and participating in
eight subsequent deliveries of weapons and supplies that year. At
the time, Congress had banned direct U.S. military aid to the
Contras.
   He is accused of lying to the CIA's inspector general office on
Jan. 11, 1987 by stating that the airstrip was built by the Costa
Rican government to train fighters for a possible invasion by
Nicaragua.
   The indictment charged Fernandez also falsely told the Tower
Commission that he did not know the supplies he helped deliver the
Contras in September 1986 included weapons and ammunition.
   Fernandez told the congressional Iran-Contra committees that the
operations were authorized by CIA officials. But he admitted that
he misled both the Tower Commission and the CIA's inspector
general, actions he said he thought were ``within the guidelines''
set by Clair George, the agency's deputy director for operations
who retired last year.
   Fernandez was one of several CIA officers disciplined by Webster
last December. Wilson said his client resigned from the agency.
   Asked if he disputed press reports that Fernandez had been
fired, Wilson said: ``Maybe yes, maybe no, it depends on the
perspective you take.''

   Here is the text of the political statement
issued Monday by the leaders of the seven largest industrialized
democracies at their economic summit:
   We the leaders of our seven countries, and the representatives
of the European Community, uphold common principles of freedom,
respect for individual rights, and the desire of all men to live in
peace under the rule of law. Our peoples stand in solidarity within
the framework of our existing alliances for the cause of freedom,
to safeguard democracy and the prosperity which it has produced. In
our discussions, we considered how these goals and values could be
pursued in the field of foreign affairs, particularly with regard
to East-West relations.
   We discussed a wide range of regional questions and these
discussions are continuing throughout the summit.
   We confirmed our belief in constructive and realistic dialogue
and cooperation, including ams control, human rights and regional
issues, as the way to build stability between East and West and
enhance security at lower levels of arms. We also reaffirmed that
for the foreseeable future nuclear deterrence and adequate
conventional strength are the guarantees of peace in freedom.
   In several important respects, changes have taken place in
relations between Western countries and the Soviet Union since we
last met. For our part, this evolution has come about because the
industrialized democracies have been strong and united. In the
Soviet Union greater freedom and openness will offer opportunities
to reduce mistrust and build confidence. Each of us will respond
positively to any such developments.
   We welcome the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal of its
occupation troops from Afghanistan. It must be total and apply to
the entire country. The Afghan people must be able to choose their
government freely. Each of us confirms our willingness to make our
full contribution to the efforts of the international community to
ensure the return of the refugees to their homeland, their
resettlement, and the reconstruction of their country. We now look
to the Soviet Union to make a constructive contribution to
resolving other regional conflicts as well.
   Since our last meeting, progress has been made between the
United States and the Soviet Union in agreeing to reduce nuclear
weapons in a manner which accords fully with the security interests
of each of our countries. The INF treaty, the direct result of
Western firmness and unity, is the first treaty ever actually to
reduce nuclear arms. It sets vitally important precedents for
future arms-control agreements: asymmetrical reductions and
intrusive verification arrangements. We now look for deep cuts in
U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive arms. We congratulate President
Reagan on what he has already accomplished, along with General
Secretary Gorbachev, towards this goal.
   Nonetheless, the massive presence of Soviet conventional forces
in Eastern Europe, the ensuing conventional superiority of the
Warsaw Pact, and its capacity to launch surprise attacks and
large-scale offensive operations, lie at the core of the security
problem in Europe. The Soviet military buildup in the Far East is
equally a major source of instability in Asia. These threats must
be reduced. Our goal is enhanced security and stability at lower
levels of forces, after having eliminated the present imbalances.
We seek the early establishment of a comprehensive, effectively
verifiable and truly global ban on chemical weapons.
   Genuine peace cannot be established solely by arms control. It
must be firmly based on respect for fundamental human rights. We
urge the Soviet Union to move forward in ensuring human dignity and
freedoms and to implement fully and strengthen substantially its
commitments under the Helsinki process. Recent progress must be
enshrined in law and practice, the painful barriers that divide
people must come down, and the obstacles to emigration must be
removed.
   We pay special attention to the countries in Eastern Europe. We
encourage them to open up their economies and societies, and to
improve respect for human rights. In this context we support the
continuation and strengthening of the Helsinki process.
   We take positive note of Eastern countries' growing interest in
ending their economic isolation, for example in the establishment
and development of relations with the Economic Community. East-West
economic relations can be expanded and serve our common interests
so long as the commercial basis is sound, they are conducted within
the framework of the basic principles and the rules of the
international trade and payments system, and are consistent with
the security interests of each of our countries.
   We strongly reaffirm our condemnation of terrorism in all its
forms, including the taking of hostages. We renew our commitment to
policies and measures agreed at previous summits, in particular
those against state-sponsored terrorism.
   We strongly condemn recent threats to air security, in
particular the destruction of a Korean airliner and the hijacking
of a Kuwaiti airliner. We recall the principle affirmed in previous
declarations that terrorists must not go unpunished. We appeal to
all countries who are not party to the international conventions on
civil aviation security, in particular the Hague Convention, to
accede to those conventions.
   We express support for work currently under way in the
International Civil Aviation Organization aimed at strengthening
international protection against hijackings. We welcome the most
recent declaration adopted by the ICAO Council which endorses the
principle that hijacked aircraft should not be allowed to take off
once they have landed, except in circumstances as specified by the
ICAO declaration.
   We welcome the adoption this year in Montreal and Rome of two
international agreements on aviation and maritime security to
enhance the safety of travelers.
   We reaffirm our determination to continue the fight against
terrorism through the application of rule of law, the policy of no
concessions to terrorists and their sponsors, and international
cooperation.
   The illegal use of drugs and illicit trafficking in them poses
grave risks to the peoples of summit countries as well as the
peoples of source and transit countries. There is an urgent need
for improved international cooperation in all appropriate fora on
programs to counter all facets of the illicit drug problem, in
particular production, trafficking, and financing of the drug
trade. The complexity of the problem requires additional
international cooperation, in particular to trace, freeze and
confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers, and to curb money
laundering.
   We look forward to the successful negotiation in Vienna in
November of a United Nations Convention on illicit trafficking.
   We supported the initiative of the government of the United
States for a special task force to be convened to propose methods
of improving cooperation in all areas including national, bilateral
and multilateral efforts in the fight against narcotics.

<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST - GULF:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We express our deep concern at the increasing instability in the
Near East. The current violence in the Occupied Territories is a
clear sign that the status quo is not sustainable. An early
negotiated settlement to the underlying Arab-Israeli dispute is
essential.
   We declare our support for the convening of a properly
structured international conference as the appropriate framework
for the necessary negotiations between the parties directly
concerned. In this perspective, we salute current efforts aimed at
achieving a settlement, particularly the initiative pursued by Mr.
Shultz since February. We urge the parties to cooperate fully in
the search for a solution.
   We have pursued our consultations about the continuing war
between Iran and Iraq, which remains a source of profound concern
to us. We reaffirm our support for Security Council Resolution 598,

   Western leaders saluted President Reagan for negotiating nuclear
arms reductions with the Soviet Union and at the same time offered
encouragement for Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
moves.
   The leaders said in a statement that changes being brought about
in the Soviet society could ``reduce mistrust and build
confidence.''

   Reagan pronounced himself ``quite satisfied'' with the course of
the summit. ``It's been gratifying to him to hear so much praise
for open-market economies and for the economic philosophy that he
has espoused for so many years,'' said his spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater.
   He said that at one point at a Sunday night dinner, Reagan
``remarked that he he was just the ball carrier and they were the
teams that had made all the plays.''

   The leaders endorsed calls for sterner action to combat
international drug trafficking.
   They called for international cooperation ``to trace, freeze and
confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb money
laundering'' through legitimate banking institutions.
   But French President Francois Mitterrand objected to a U.S.
proposal for a task force to seek improved cooperation in the
battle against narcotics. Mitterrand said the summit nations should
not act as a kind of world directorate, with activities outside the
scope of their annual meeting, according to his spokesman, Hubert
Vedrine.

<HEAD>SUMMIT-EASTERN BLOC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Urging Gorbachev to press ahead with more freedom and openness
in the Soviet Union, the summit leaders promised, ``Each of us will
respond positively to any such developments.''
   Holding out the prospect of increased trade with Soviet-bloc
nations, the summit leaders said, ``We take positive note of
Eastern countries' growing interest in ending their economic
isolation.''
   They also urged Eastern European nations to improve respect for
human rights, but did not link that issue to an expansion of
East-West trade.
</TEXT>

<HEAD>SUMMIT-ARMS CONTROL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The summit participants said that nuclear weapons and
conventional forces are the best deterrents to war for the
foreseeable future.
   They hailed the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons (INF), saying ``we now look for
deep cuts in U.S. and Soviet strategic offensive arms.''
   However, they urged a go-slow approach on negotiating with
Moscow for cutbacks in long-range missile arsenals.
</TEXT>

<HEAD>SUMMIT-AFGHANISTAN</HEAD>

   The leaders also welcomed the beginning of the Soviet withdrawal
of troops from Afghanistan, insisting that ``it must be total and
apply to the entire country. The Afghan people must be able to
choose their government freely.''
   Offering general support for a U.S. proposal, the leaders
pledged ``to make our full contribution'' to help Afghan refugees
return home and rebuild their country.
</TEXT>

<HEAD>SUMMIT-ECONOMIC ISSUES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of the industrialized nations focused on progress
made in refining the economic coordination process, including a
U.S. proposal to add a commodity price index to the list of
indicators the countries monitor to make sure they are pursuing
complimentary policies, according to U.S. officials.
</TEXT>

<HEAD>SUMMIT-SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Summit leaders said that ``all legal options available'' in
South Africa should be used to secure clemency for the Sharpeville
Six, who have been condemned to death despite worldwide objections.
   The seven leaders also said recent moves by the white-led
government to stop anti-apartheid groups from receiving funds from
foreign sources ``would place severe strain on the relations each
of us has with South Africa.''

   An official of the Japanese delegation to the summit said the
benefit of the increased imports and lower tariffs on U.S. beef and
oranges, agreed to by Japan Monday, will be available to other
countries worldwide.
   The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said Australia had expressed a particular interest in the issue
because of its beef production. He said Japanese Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita may send his agriculture minister, Takashi Sato,
to Australia soon.

   First lady Nancy Reagan encouraged young children to develop a
love for books, advising them that ``you'll never be lonely if you
read.''
   Mrs. Reagan joined the wives of four other world leaders
attending the annual economic summit of industrialized nations in
making a pitch for reading to 150 children from five schools in
downtown Toronto.
   The children, ranging in age from 8 to 11, listened intently as
Mila Mulroney, wife of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, read
about a mischievous cat named Josephine who disrupted school one
day.

   To commuters, it was inconvenient. For 100
political fringe groups, it led to the rally of a lifetime. But to
the growing subculture of street people in Canada's richest city,
the seven-nation economic summit was irrelevant.
   ``I don't really understand it. Are they trying to make more
money?'' said a 17-year-old girl with a Mohawk haircut who was
panhandling for change Monday opposite the Eaton Center, a
glittering mall on Toronto's main drag, Yonge Street.
   ``I've been out on the streets for three years,'' said the girl,
who identified herself as Sally. ``I don't even understand the
summit.''
   A few blocks east, young people slept on plastic sheets and
blankets in Allan Gardens, which like many Toronto parks provides
temporary haven in a city with a booming economy but the worst
housing shortage in the country.
   ``It's a side Toronto wants to cover up and ignore,'' said the
Rev. Rudy Mumm, an Oblate missionary who works with the city's
estimated 15,000 street people.
   ``We're outraged that such a big to-do is made and all this
money spent when you have people who are dying in the streets in a
city that's so prosperous,'' Mumm said.
   The average price of a house in Toronto is $186,750, and the
rental market is so tight there is just one vacancy for every 1,000
apartments. The waiting list for the few government-subsidized
units is three years.
   Toronto Mayor Art Eggleton was delighted when Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney picked the Ontario capital to host the 14th economic
summit. He welcomed the $16 million expenditure and said it would
boost tourism and investment and publicize Toronto's bid for the
1996 Olympic Games.
   But people who had to go to work in the offices of the city's
financial Bay Street district, adjacent to summit headquarters in
the Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center, viewed the summit
differently.
   Up to 15 blocks at a time were closed as a motorcade carrying
President Reagan or British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
whisked past, and parking was at a premium with day-long rates
hiked from $6.50 to $10.
   For all that, anticipated rush-hour traffic jams never
materialized. Many people simply took the day off. From hot dog
vendors to cab drivers, most people went about their business
unaffected by the high-powered discussions nearby.
   But the city's parochial, Anglo-Saxon origins once brought it
the nickname ``Toronto the Good,'' and that earnestness surfaced
during the summit.
   While many of greater Toronto's 3.4 million people waved
cheerily as police guided summit limousines through their
neighborhoods, a loose alliance of 100 political groups used the
event to promote causes as diverse as abortion and starving
Somalian children.
   In a 1960s atmosphere of protest songs, long hair and
anti-establishment T-shirts, about 1,500 people gathered at a sunny
Sunday afternoon rally under the theme, ``People Before Profits.''
   But when they tried to march to the summit to deliver a
citizens' warrant charging the leaders with crimes against
humanity, an army of uniformed and SWAT team police blocked their
way, made more than 100 arrests and cleared the street in an
aggressive arm-to-arm charge backed by officers on horseback.
   Onlookers said they never thought they would see such police
tactics in normally peaceful Toronto, where crosswalk lights are
obeyed and litter is a surprise.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Robert Bruckner, a University of Toronto
student who helped organize anti-summit protests. ``We've never
seen anything like that in Canada before.''
   An academic challenge to the world leaders came from the Summit
Citizens' Conference at Ryerson Technical Institute, where hundreds
of concerned Torontonians paid $5 to hear lectures on ``ethical
investing,'' growth without pollution and alternative strategies
for full employment.
   The city's Basic Poverty Action Group organized tours of ``The
Real Toronto'' to show visiting media aspects of the city invisible
from their downtown hotels.
   They looked at low-cost apartment buildings being converted into
luxury condos, at hostels feeding the poor for 50 cents each and
food banks helping 3,000 people a day, and at storefront cashiers
that charge welfare recipients 15 percent to cash their checks.
   ``It may sound like a land of milk and honey, but many people
can't get a place to live and end up on the streets,'' said Frank
Pimentel of the Downtown Christian Workers' Association.
   ``They should spend more bucks on that problem, rather than
throwing a party at the Toronto Convention Center. People will
never forget this summit.''

   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev holds his Communist
Party conference in Moscow next week he will have _ for better or
for worse _ the support of President Reagan and his partners at the
economic summit.
   Gorbachev's effort to reconstruct the Soviet economy is
encountering a lot of resistance, but he now can tell skeptics that
he is winning friends _ and the promise of more trade _ from the
West.
   The promise is contained in the political declaration issued
Monday by President Reagan and his six summit partners. They also
urged Gorbachev to expand human rights.
   ``We confirmed our belief in constructive and realistic dialogue
and cooperation,'' the declaration said. It was based on the
individual observations of the seven leaders and a report Reagan
gave at dinner Sunday night of his talks with Gorbachev in Moscow.
   In his three years in power, Gorbachev has worked hard to
convince the West that he is interested in conciliation. He has
promoted arms control as one way to ease tensions, and released
scores of political prisoners to establish his credentials as a
Soviet leader determined to break with the past.
   By easing tensions, Gorbachev gets a respite from the arms race
and a chance to divert the money and energy he saves into the
Soviet economy.
   The three-page declaration cautioned Gorbachev and East European
leaders that expanded trade would have to be economically sound and
``consistent with the security interests'' of the seven
industrialized democracies.
   More to the point, though, it lauded Gorbachev for
``perestroika'' and for improving human rights and said the West
would respond to this ``evolution'' in a positive way.
   ``Greater freedom and openness will offer opportunities to
reduce mistrust and build confidence,'' Reagan and his six partners
declared. ``Each of us will respond positively to any such
developments.''
   The leaders welcomed the onset of a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan and the progress in reducing nuclear weapons since the
last economic summit meeting in Venice, Italy, a year ago.
   ``In several important respects, changes have taken place in
relations between Western countries and the Soviet Union since we
last met,'' the statement said.
   For a group of six capitalists and one Socialist, President
Francois Mitterrand of France, the approval and encouragement to
the communist leader reflected the growing accommodation between
East and West.
   At past summits, the seven leaders were inclined to sharply
criticize the Soviets. The statement issued Monday, at Reagan's
final economic conclave, found several items to criticize,
including a military buildup in the Far East and the ``massive
presence'' of Soviet ground troops in Eastern Europe.
   ``These threats must be reduced,'' the statement said.
   But its overall thrust was positive.
   Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine, said the declaration
reflected a major change from the statements issued at the 1985 and
1986 summits.
   ``The tone is not the same,'' he told reporters. ``You can see
how far we've come in a few years.''
   Reagan's summit meeting with Gorbachev in Moscow apparently was
the clincher.
   According to his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, the president was
pessimistic about ``certain aspects of the defense posture and the
overall adversarial nature of many Soviet policies.''
   And, the White House official said, ``he did remind the group
that the Soviet Union remains a controlled society.''
   But the bottom line is that Reagan, who built a political career
running against communism and big government, approved of Gorbachev.
   ``The president feels General Secretary Gorbachev is a leader we
can do business with, that he is serious about reforms in a number
of areas, economic and social,'' Fitzwater said.
   When the Soviet Communist Party opens its conference on June 28,
the first such session since 1941, the endorsement Gorbachev
received from Reagan and the leaders of Canada, Britain, France,
Italy, Japan and West Germany will at least reassure the
rank-and-file within the Soviet Union that the West is with their
leader.

   President Reagan stood in front of the Rising Sun
banner of Japan to salute the signing of a new U.S.-Japanese
agreement on science and technology _ but not without a flap about
whose flag went where.
   As spectators and journalists gathered in a hotel ballroom to
view Monday's signing ceremony at the seven-nation economic summit,
the American flag stood at the right of the bandstand and the
Japanese on the left.
   About 20 minutes before the ceremony was to start, two Japanese
came out from backstage, picked up the flags, base and all, and
swapped them.
   That was where matters stood for several minutes. Then two
Americans came out, picked up the flags, and put them back where
they were to begin with.
   After Japanese and American aides conferred in an aisle, the
flags were left as the Americans had put them.
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
explained the goings-on this way:
   The White House maintained that for protocol reasons the
American flag should be on the right at the ceremony, for which
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita came to the hotel where
Reagan is staying.
   The Japanese, however, took the position that the flag of Japan
should be on the right side, because that was where Takeshita was
to sit as the two leaders signed the treaty. In any event, the two
flags and the two leaders ended up where they were scheduled to be
_ with Takeshita seated on the Stars and Stripes side and Reagan on
the Rising Sun side.

   As the seven summit leaders dined in the splendid dining room at
Hart Hall on the University of Toronto campus, the pool of
reporters, photographers and cameramen accompanying President
Reagan ate box lunches in a gymnasium.
   During their approximately three-hour wait for the trip back to
the president's hotel, they wrote, read, worked crossword puzzles,
pitched pennies and competed in making and flying paper airplanes.
   They didn't play cards. Nobody had brought a deck.

   Study in contrasts: As the summit leaders' dinner broke up, a
lengthy motorcade formed in a circular drive, lights blazed at the
entrance of Hart Hall and, as the president stepped out, motorcyles
roared into action for the trip to his hotel a mile or so away.
   As the motorcade prepared to leave, two groups of people were
seen walking down a darkened sidewalk alongside the drive. At the
center of the first group was Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of West
Germany. At the center of the second was Francois Mitterrand, the
president of France.

   Police have concluded that an Irishman arrested
over the weekend before the start of the seven-nation economic
summit is not a member of the Irish Republican Army terror group.
   Michael Derek Collins was arrested Saturday for overstaying a
one-month visa issued to him last year. Police in Ireland said
Collins was a junior operative in the outlawed IRA during the 1970s.
   But police here said Collins is only being held pending an
immigration hearing and that no criminal charges are being brought
against him.
   Police Inspector Bob Guay said summit security forces are paying
strict attention to possible activities by the IRA because of the
presence here of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But he denied the group is posing a specific threat to Mrs.
Thatcher during her stay. ``We have to be ever-mindful of all
terrorist groups in the world,'' he said.

   Stifling temperatures are adding to the
drought-induced misery in parts of America, but even the 104-degree
record set in Lincoln, Neb., is 30 degrees short of the national
all-time high.
   Record highs recorded in the Midwest and Plains this week
include Sunday's 104 degrees at Lincoln, breaking a record of 103
for the date set in 1974; 95 degrees in Alpena, Mich., topping the
92-degree mark of 1964; and 103 in Sioux City, Iowa, beating the
99-degree record set in 1933 and 1953.
   The highest official reading in the United States was set July
10, 1913, in Death Valley, Calif., when the thermometer reached 134
degrees Fahrenheit.
   Death Valley has the perfect conditions for setting heat
records: low elevation in an already warm area, clear skies and
subsiding air on the lee side of mountains, geographer David H.
Hickcox says in ``Weatherwise'' magazine.
   Even so, it seldom reaches the sweltering heights of the 130s,
rarely exceeding 127 degrees, Hickcox reports. But it is steadily
hot, with the daily high falling below 105 only once during June of
1987, for example.
   While Death Valley gets the attention, however, high temperature
records of more than 100 degrees have been set in every state at
one time or another.
   Even seemingly frigid Alaska has managed the century mark,
recording 100 degrees at Fort Yukon on June 27, 1915.
   That ties Hawaii, where the 100-degree record was set at Pahala
on April 27, 1931.
   Alaska and Hawaii, with their records of 100 degrees, tie for
the lowest such record.
   Here is a rundown of the record high temperatures that have been
set in each state, as reported by the National Climatic Data Center:
   Alabama: 112, Sept. 5, 1925, Centerville.
   Alaska: 100, June 27, 1915, Fort Yukon.
   Arizona: 127: July 7, 1905, Parker.

   A father of 11 was charged with murder Monday
in connection with what police said was an unprovoked Father's Day
shooting spree at a bar.
   Robert Edward McLaughlin, 51, of Glenshaw, turned himself in to
Shaler Township police one hour after Brett Stidham, 22, of
Pittsburgh, died Monday at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh.
   State police said McLaughlin opened fire Sunday night inside the
Plainview Bar in Penn Township, shooting Stidham and three others
before fleeing in a pickup truck. Investigators said they believe
McLaughlin didn't know his victims.
   In addition to murder, McLaughlin was charged with attempted
murder and aggravated assault. One of the three shooting survivors
was critically injured, another was hospitalized in fair condition
and the third was treated and released.
   District Justice Frank Wise ordered McLaughlin jailed without
bond.

<HEAD>Droughts Have Plagued America Throughout History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the dry spell that threatened the
Pilgrim's corn crop in 1621 to the devastating droughts on the
Great Plains in the 1880s and 1930s, lack of rain has been a
periodic plague in America.
   ``Of the many natural forces that wage war on farmers and
ranchers, the most demoralizing is a prolonged drought,'' President
Dwight Eisenhower said during the 1950s drought. ``In its grip, the
individual farmer is well-nigh helpless.''
   Perhaps the worst instances of drought in American history dried
out the Plains both 50 and 100 years ago and hit the Southwest in
the 1950s.
   Whether the current drought will match the disasters of the past
remains to be seen, but a look back shows it is not unique.
   Firmly fixed in American memory is the dry time in the 1930s,
which coincided with the economic chaos of the Great Depression.
   The plight of homeless farmers heading west was recounted in
books such as John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' The term
``Okies,'' for those who fled Oklahoma's parched farms, became
attached to millions of Americans displaced from the land.
   In many respects, the era was an echo of the 1880s.
   Twenty years of good rainfall ended in 1881, and the dry spell
held on until 1887, launching an exodus of farmers from Kansas and
Nebraska.
   ``In God we trusted, in Kansas we busted,'' was a popular saying
of the time, according to weather historian David Ludlum. One
writer of that era estimated that half the residents of western
Kansas had departed by 1892, and dry summers from 1893-95 didn't
ease the misery.
   Both of these earlier droughts followed wet periods that had
encouraged increased settlement, cultivation of land and
overgrazing.
   ``Each drought period set in motion an emigration that grew into
a rout. In both cases the series of rainy years had been mistaken
for normal climate, with disastrous results,'' the Department of
Agriculture reported in 1941.
   By some accounts, the drought of the 1950s was as bad as those
before. And records of lengthy dry spells threatening American
crops date back to 1621 and the Pilgrims.
   The dry spell that threatened the Pilgrims' crops lasted just 24
days, Ludlum reported in ``The American Weather Book.'' But drought
threatened again in 1623, killing the corn crop.
   Eastern New England suffered severe dryness in 1749 and again in
1761-62, when fields of grain caught fire and even homes were
burned. There were dry years also in 1805 and 1822.
   Drought threatened crops from New York to Missouri in 1854,
while dryness led to searing dust storms in newly settled Kansas in
1860.
   Then came the two decades of rainfall that encouraged settlement
of the Plains and set the stage for the disaster of the 1880s.
   Here is a look at some of the other droughts that have affected
the United States:
   _The 1950s was a time when dust storms once again swirled across
dry land on the Plains. Tree ring studies conducted by the
University of Arizona indicate that the 1950s decade was the driest
period in the Southwest in 700 years.
   In Kansas, two-thirds of the state's farmers had to find
off-farm jobs and by 1957, people were leaving farms at the rate of
4,000 a day.
   _It was the Northeast that suffered from drought in the 1960s.
Major cities faced shortages with reservoir levels falling to
record lows in the driest period in 160 years.
   Forest fires swept large areas, washing cars and watering lawns
became illegal, and diners had to ask for water at even the most
posh eateries. Wells failed, leaving farmers without water, and the
level of the Great Lakes dropped alarmingly.
   _Drought was felt at the end of the 1960s and early 1970s in the
Southwest and in Florida, raising dust storms in Texas and leading
to grass fires even in the Everglades swampland.
   _California was the victim of drought in the later 1970s,
suffering its driest year on record in 1977. Water rationing was
implemented and farmers lost an estimated $2.4 billion.

<HEAD>Defense Consultant Has Ties To Others Named In Pentagon Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense consultant William Galvin, one of the
38 subjects of FBI search warrants in the Pentagon fraud
investigation, has a wide variety of ties with other people and
companies named in the probe.
   FBI agents last week scoured Galvin's office in the Watergate
complex where Melvyn Paisley, the former assistant secretary of the
Navy identified as a key figure in the 2-year-old investigation,
also has his office.
   Federal agents also looked at the office of Galvin's stepson,
Ken Brooke, of Vienna, Va.
   No arrests have been made in the fraud case, which involves
allegations that defense contractors used consultants to obtain
confidential Defense Department information. Bribes were paid to
people inside the Pentagon, officials claim.
   Galvin, whose business is named Athena Associates, and Paisley
both worked as consultants for United Technologies Corp., a large
defense contracting firm based in Hartford, Conn.
   Galvin is a consultant to Norden Systems while Paisley works for
Pratt & Whitney. Both Norden and Pratt & Whitney are divisions of
United Technologies.
   The Hartford Courant has put the relationship even closer.
   ``When Paisley was with the Navy, Galvin was a conduit to him,''
the newspaper quoted a source as saying. ``They had a
relationship.'' Paisley, who resigned from the Navy in April 1987,
was a close associate of John Lehman Jr., the former Navy secretary.
   Efforts to contact the men were unsuccessful. Galvin was not in
his office, said a man who answered the telephone. All calls were
referred to his attorney, William Nussbaum, who did not return a
call. Paisley did not answer his telephone. Brooke declined to talk
about the investigation.
   Larry Bingaman, a UTC spokesman, said the company had a policy
of not divulging information about consultants. Norden manufactures
military radar and communications equipment; Pratt & Whitney makes
aircraft engines.
   Galvin has three other clients that were the subjects of FBI
search warrants last week. They are Loral Corp., Unisys Corp., and
Cubic Corp., according to published reports.
   Galvin had another relationship with a firm on the list of
companies investigated by the FBI: he was director of Armtec Inc.,
of Palatka, Fla., according to records on file with the Florida
secretary of state.
   Armtec, a small 80-person firm that manufactures wiring
harnesses, is located in the congressional district of Rep. Bill
Chappell, D-Fla., chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee
on defense.
   Chappell is reportedly under scrutiny in the nationwide inquiry,
but he has denied any wrongdoing and called the reports a ``bunch
of bunk.''
   The Florida Democrat, however, said he was instrumental in
getting Armtec to move to the state's 4th Congressional District in
1986 because the company's president, William Roberts, is a close
personal friend.
   Roberts, who has a house in Alexandria, Va., as well as in
Florida, said in a statement that the company ``intends to
cooperate fully with the government in its investigation,'' though
it has done nothing wrong.
   Friends of Galvin said he and his wife, Evelyn, recently moved
from an exclusive area in McLean, Va., where former CIA Director
Stansfield Turner was a neighbor, to the Watergate apartment
complex.
   ``They were wonderful people,'' said Mrs. Robert Kimberly, a
friend. The couple entertained frequently as part of their active
social life, acquaintances said.
   Galvin's daughter, Joan, works on Capitol Hill as a legislative
aide to Rep. Andy Ireland, R-Fla. She coordinates Ireland's work on
the House Armed Services Committee, according to his spokesman,
Doug Hattaway.
   Hattaway said Ms. Galvin joined the congressman's staff 18
months before Ireland was appointed to the powerful panel.
   CBS News reported Monday night that Ireland is among a few House
members who are under scrutiny in the case, but that there is not
yet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation.
   Henry Hudson, the U.S. attorney who is coordinating the
investigation from Alexandria, Va., said 270 subpoenas have been
issued and that additional search warrants may be issued.
   Some of the 38 search warrants under seal in the probe from last
week may be opened to the public by the end of this week, he said.

<HEAD>FDA Chief Says Academic Researchers `Irresponsible' in AIDS
Epidemic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food and Drug Administration Commissioner
Frank Young says academic researchers are choosing to stay at home
for ``the big bucks'' in research grants instead of volunteering to
help the government respond to the AIDS crisis.
   In a speech at a conference of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, Young said Monday he believed ``the
academic community has markedly failed in the AIDS problem.''
   University researchers, he said, ``are being irresponsible
because they want to stand on the sidelines and grab the big bucks
instead of taking the heat'' of helping to make AIDS policy
decisions in Washington.
   Young, 56, said scientists from his generation felt an
obligation to contribute time to government service and that he
gave up a laboratory with $2 million in research grants to take on
his government job.
   Most academic researchers now, he said, refuse to give any time
to the government, even as the nation confronts what Young called
``an extremely serious disease'' in acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Young said the FDA is attempting to hasten the approval process
needed to put new AIDS drugs on the market, but he said there is a
shortage of the experts needed to evaluate drug applications and
testing results.
   Right now, he said, there are 162 drugs being evaluated, but the
agency has only 127 people available to sift through applications
that may include 100,000 pages.
   Without the help of experts from academic laboratories, said
Young, ``the process will be slowed.''
   The commissioner said he repeatedly has asked academic
researchers to spend two years in government service, at their same
academic salary, to help battle AIDS. But, he said, ``they don't
want to leave their laboratories. I see very few people willing to
pay the price.''
   Officials at several major research institutions declined to
comment on Young's statements, although Martin Hersch, a Harvard
University researcher, said it still is common for scientists to
spend several years early in their careers in government
laboratories such as those at the National Institutes of Health and
the Centers for Disease Control.
   Young said of the 162 AIDS drugs now in some phase of evaluation
and testing by his agency, three are vaccines. Tests of the
vaccines, he said, are at least two years away and when those tests
do occur ``it's going to be horrible.''
   He said there is no laboratory animal that can be used to test
AIDS drugs and the vaccines will have to be tested on human
patients. This means dangerous side effects usually detected in
animal tests will be found, instead, among the human test subjects.
   Also, Young said, only half of the AIDS patients being tested
will receive the vaccine and the rest will receive a placebo. Since
AIDS is thought to be 100 percent fatal, he said, those receiving
the placebo will not survive.
   Young said the vaccine testing probably will have to take place
in African countries where the rate of AIDS infection is far more
serious than in the United States. French researchers, he said,
probably will start testing a vaccine in Zaire sometime next year.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Impose Consumer Protections</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: St Germain, no period, is cq</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial institutions offering home equity
loans would have to provide consumers with detailed descriptions of
the terms before requiring any non-refundable fees, under
House-approved legislation now headed for the Senate.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
said the bill, approved on a House voice vote Monday, would put
``an end to carnival-type advertising that lures homeowners into
deals they can't afford.''
   The legislation would prohibit misleading advertising and place
a series of new consumer protections on the loans, which have
increased in popularity because of tax advantages under the income
tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
   The legislation also includes requirements that lenders base
variable rates on publicly available indexes outside of their own
control, and it prohibits them from requiring speeded-up payments
unless the customer is at fault.
   The bill was sent to the Senate, which has already approved
similar legislation as part of broader banking legislation. The two
chambers must agree on identical bills before the legislation goes
to the president.
   An industry spokeswoman said bankers hoped to win changes in the
bill before final passage.
   ``We support the concept of the bill ... and we look forward to
working with Congress to pass a bill that fully balances the needs
of consumers and creditors,'' said Mary-Liz Meany of the American
Bankers Association, who said her group considered the legislation
too complex.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the consumer
subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, said the measure is
needed because people are rushing to use home equity loans because
of their continued tax-deductibility.
   They might be ``the fastest growing craze since the Hula Hoop,''
he said.
   Surveys of banks and other lenders indicate home equity credit
lines have grown steadily over the past two years and are expected
to grow another 40 percent this year, Ms. Meany said.
   In 1985, the public owed $20 billion in home equity loans out of
$150 billion in all second mortgages. By the end of 1987, there
were $64 billion in equity loans out of about $200 billion in
second mortgages, she said.

<TEXT>
   A district judge sent a teen-ager back to
jail for failing to reveal the whereabouts of her pet ferret, Fuji,
which authorities fear might be rabid and may have bitten a
5-year-old boy.
   Nineteen-year-old Jennifer Au, who hid her ferret to protect it
from decapitation in a rabies test, claims she doesn't know its
whereabouts because she arranged to have it picked up at an
abandoned house by an anonymous person who volunteered safe haven.
   But Prince William County Circuit Judge Percy Thornton Jr. on
Monday told Ms. Au, ``you will sit in the jail until whoever brings
in the ferret.''
   ``It is now the 20th of June and still no ferret. You will go to
jail today,'' he declared.
   ``I don't know how I'm supposed to find the ferret if I am
sitting here in jail,'' Ms. Au said after she was taken to the
Prince William-Manassas Regional Adult Detention Center.
   The ferret flap has simmered since June 3, when 5-year-old
Austin Jacob Simpson of nearby Dale City was bitten by a ferret
during a visit to a pet store.
   Ms. Au, who worked at the pet store at the time, said she saw
the incident and that her pet did not bite the boy. The other two
ferrets were tested for rabies _ a process which involves killing
the animal and examining its brain tissue _ and were found not to
be rabid.
   Ms. Au has been charged with concealing her ferret to prevent
its destruction or confinement, and on Thursday she was cited for
contempt and given 12 hours to produce the animal.
   The deadline later was extended until Monday morning, when
Thornton ordered her jailed indefinitely for failing for produce
the ferret, a weasel-like animal.
   Auston, meanwhile, has undergone four of six rabies
inoculations, which doctors say could have serious side effects on
someone so young. His mother, Sandy Lee, said she didn't understand
how someone ``could have a perspective so wrong as to put an animal
before a child.''
   Judge Thornton told Au during Monday's hearing: ``If it were in
this court's power I would put you through the same thing this
child is going through.''
   Ms. Au had been jailed for three hours last Thursday after she
shouted at the judge during a court hearing. After her return to
jail on Monday, Ms. Au said, ``This is extremely stupid and
ridiculous, needless. This has gone too far.''
   Au said she wants the ferret returned, but that she could turn
up no information on Fuji's whereabouts in her contacts with ferret
groups and others.
   Meanwhile, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Wenda Travers said
that her office received a call Friday from someone who identified
himself as Smith and said he had the ferret and would return it
``once the pressure is taken off'' Au.

   Michael Dukakis, dismissing George Bush's
criticism of a Massachusetts inmate furlough policy, said the
federal government and most states have such programs and that
President Reagan supported furloughs when he was California
governor.
   ``These are part and parcel of all kinds of responsible
corrections programs,'' the Massachusetts governor and probable
Democratic presidential nominee said Monday.
   Dukakis, who celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary Monday, was
traveling to California today. He was addressing the national
convention of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, and aides said he would also meet with Jackson.
   At a luncheon of national broadcast executives on Monday,
Dukakis was asked about Bush's weekend criticism of the
Massachusetts furlough policy, particularly a case in which a
convicted murderer escaped while on furlough and raped a Maryland
woman.
   Dukakis said nearly all states have furlough programs and that
16,000 federal inmates were granted furloughs last year. The
governor did not mention, however, that most states do not grant
furloughs to murderers.
   ``They not only give them weekend furloughs, they give 30-day
furloughs,'' Dukakis said of the federal system.
   ``Ronald Reagan had a furlough program as governor of
California,'' he said.
   Bob Gore, spokesman for the California Department of
Corrections, said then-Gov. Ronald Reagan terminated a work
furlough program after a convicted armed robber and a convicted
forger on work furlough robbed a couple in Orange County in 1972,
killing one of the robbery victims.
   ``As a result, the program was terminated by the Reagan
administration and the deputy director in charge of the parole
division was fired,'' Gore said.
   Since then, Gore said, the only work furlough program for
California inmates is part of the transition program for inmates
about to be released, and is limited to those who have not
committed violent crimes.
   Bush, the vice president and likely Republican presidential
nominee, has been trying to portray Dukakis as soft on crime by
pointing to the governor's opposition to the death penalty, and
playing up the furlough controversy.
   Dukakis initially stood behind furloughs for those convicted of
murder but later agreed to change it so inmates serving life
sentences would not be eligible.
   On Monday he repeated his opposition to the death penalty, which
he opposes on philosophical grounds, and said there was no evidence
that capital punishment was a deterrent to drug-related crime. He
also cited declines in his state in the crime rate and drug use
among students.
   ``The proof of the pudding is in the eating,'' Dukakis said.
``This is not an accident. I go to the people on this issue with a
record.''
   Dukakis reiterated his plan to name a Cabinet-level drug czar
and said Reagan administration anti-drug efforts have failed
because of a lack of leadership from a committee Reagan named to
coordinate such programs.
   ``There is nobody in charge,'' he said. ``There is nobody
accountable. The chairman of the committee is (Attorney General) Ed
Meese. 'Nuff said.''
   Dukakis was asked about how he would deal with supporters of
Jesse Jackson who believe Jackson should be offered the No. 2 spot
on the Democratic ticket.
   ``I don't see that as a problem,'' he said. ``I think we are
going to be very much together.''
   He said he had the ``luxury of several weeks'' to select a
running mate before the Democratic National Convention in mid-July
and that he would be ``looking at a large number of people.''

   Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign notched a
healthy fund-raising month in May, and more importantly, remained
far enough below the primary season spending cap to allow Dukakis
to campaign across the country before the Democratic convention
next month.
   Financial disclosure forms released by the Dukakis campaign
Monday indicated that the campaign raised $2,259,359 in
contributions in May and also received a $953,121 in federal
matching funds.
   The campaign ended the month with $2 million on hand, according
to forms filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   The strong May fund-raising effort brought to $8.57 million the
amount the campaign has raised through contributions this calendar
year, according to the FEC filing. It received an additional $7.75
million in matching funds during that period.
   The FEC forms indicated that as of May 31 Dukakis had spent
$19.4 million against the $27.6 million spending cap for the
primary season, leaving him with a comfortable cushion that allows
for the scheduling of several campaign trips before next month's
Democratic National Convention.
   He spent three days in the South last week and has trips to the
Midwest and West planned before the Atlanta convention.
   ``Careful budgeting has given us the finances so that right up
until the convention the governor can go to different regions of
the country and continue the campaign in an active and vibrant
way,'' said Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan. ``Careful budgeting has
paid off.''
   Dukakis' Republican counterpart, Vice President George Bush, has
had to dramatically cut campaign travel because he has spent nearly
to the limit.
   Robert A. Farmer, campaign treasurer for Dukakis, said total
fund-raising, including that of last year, had reached $19.2
million.
   In a statement, he said Dukakis has received contributions from
90,000 individuals from all 50 states, with an average donation of
$175. The maximum individual donation allowed by law is $1,000.
   Farmer, the man behind the Dukakis campaign's record-setting
fund-raising, is planning to help national and state Democratic
party organizations raise money for the general election, when the
burden of campaign financing shifts from individual candidates to
party groups.
   ``This year, the Democrats are going to create a financially
level playing field with the Republicans,'' Farmer said.
   At a fund-raiser earlier this month that netted $500,000, Farmer
said the Dukakis camaign had reached its limit for primary
fund-raising and was concentrating on raising $2.6 million for a
legal fund.
   The latest financial disclosure form, released by the Dukakis
campaign headquarters in Boston, indicated that the campaign had
$2,027,924 on hand as of May 31. It had $1.4 million on hand at the
beginning of the month.
   The campaign spent more than $2.8 million in May.
   The Dukakis campaign, which has not taken out any loans,
reported that it had outstanding bills totaling $669,100 and was
owed $224,474.
   A listing of state-by-state expenses related to primary
elections showed that the campaign spent $153,678 in California
last month, by far the largest single-state expenditure in May.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, clinched the delegate
majority needed for the nomination with a June 7 sweep of primaries
in California and three other states.
   During the first five months of this year, the campaign's
greatest allocation in a single state was the $1 million spent in
Texas. Dukakis won the March 8 primary there.

<HEAD>Dukakis And Jackson To Meet; Bush Spotlights Drug Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: No morning events for Dukakis or Jackson; lead prospects
uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>

   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson were holding their
first face-to-face talk today since Dukakis wrapped up the party's
presidential nomination two weeks ago. Republican George Bush,
meanwhile, said it ``burns me up'' when politicians fail to credit
federal drug agents for a job well done.
   Meanwhile, a poll published today in The Washington Post
suggested Dukakis holds a double-digit lead over Bush. Several
other surveys in recent weeks have turned up similar results.
   The vice president was highlighting drug issues today for the
second day in a row, meeting with narcotics-interdiction officials
and holding talks with drug advisers. On Monday, he attended a
memorial service for three Drug Enforcement Administration agents
killed in the line of duty.
   ``In this political season I hear comments from people of both
parties giving no credit to all the job the men and women in this
room and across the country are doing,'' Bush told agency
employees. ``It burns me up.''
   The vice president, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, has
come under frequent fire from both Dukakis and Jackson over what
they describe as a failed anti-drug effort by the administration.
   Dukakis dished out more criticism on Monday, pointing out that a
committee President Reagan set up to coordinate anti-drug programs
was headed by Attorney General Edwin Meese III and adding
sarcastically: `` 'Nuff said.''
   Meese, who has been under criminal investigation for more than a
year, was on hand for the ceremony Bush attended, and praised the
vice president for his stance on drug issues.
   The vice president took the opportunity to repeat his call for
the death penalty for drug kingpins. Dukakis opposes the death
penalty under any circumstances.
   The Massachusetts governor has been on the defensive on
law-and-order isues in recent days. Bush has attacked him over a
Massachusetts prison program, now revised, which allowed murderers
serving life sentences to go out on furloughs. One murderer out on
a Massachusetts furlough raped a Maryland woman, prompting the
change.
   ``I know of no responsible corrections program in the country,
with very few exceptions, that does not include furloughs,''
Dukakis said Monday, adding that there was a furlough program in
California when Reagan was governor.
   As governor, Reagan terminated a work furlough program after two
prisoners out on furlough killed a person during a 1972 robbery,
said Bob Gore, a spokesman for the California Department of
Corrections.
   Both Dukakis and Jackson were to be in California today, and
aides said they would meet this afternoon. Dukakis was speaking to
a labor convention in Los Angeles; Jackson had no campaign
appearances planned.
   The pair's last get-together was also in California _ on June 7
the day of the state's primary that, along with contests in three
other states, gave Dukakis a numerical lock on the nomination. They
have spoken frequently by phone since then.
   Neither campaign offered any specifics about what might be
discussed today.
   ``They've been talking about convention issues,'' said Jackson
spokesman Pam Smith. That, of course, could include the prickly
matter of who will be on the ticket with Dukakis.
   With less than a month remaining before the Democrats convene in
Atlanta, the Massachusetts governor must soon select a running mate.
   Jackson has been insisting he deserves special consideration by
virtue of his second-place finish in the Democratic contest. But
while he has indicated he wants to be offered the No. 2 spot on the
ticket, he won't say whether he'd accept it.
   Dukakis has said repeatedly that the choice is his alone to
make. Several polls have suggested that the ticket would be hurt by
Jackson's presence.
   The Massachusetts governor said Monday he is unworried about a
possible confrontation with the Jackson forces over his choice of a
second, or over platform issues.
   ``I think we are going to be very much together,'' he told
broadcast executives in Boston.
   And he was at pains to dispel any notion that he feels pressured
on the matter of a running mate, pointing out he has the ``luxury
of a few weeks'' to make the decision.
   Dukakis also has the luxury of being well below the federal
spending cap for the preconvention phase of the campaign. Bush, by
contrast, is bumping up against that limit and has been forced to
curtail his campaign travel.
   Financial disclosure forms released Monday by the Dukakis
campaign indicated that as of May 31, Dukakis had spent $19.4
million of the $27 million allowed.
   ``Careful budgeting has paid off,'' said Dukakis spokesman Mark
Gearan. The Massachusetts governor has trips planned to the Midwest
and the West before the convention opens July 18.
   The vice president, however, has found himself unable to travel
at a time when polls are suggesting he needs to come on strong. The
Washington Post survey out today gave Dukakis a 12-point lead, 51
percent to 39 percent. The telephone survey of 1,012 adults, of
whom 782 were registered voters, had a margin of error of 3 points
for the larger sample, and 4 points for the smaller group. Polling
was conducted from Wednesday to Sunday.
   Jackson was in Minnesota on Monday, where he visited a
drought-stricken farm, and gave every indication he would continue
his increasingly quixotic presidential bid.
   ``It's dark and we've got to hold on until morning comes,'' he
said. ``You never have a right to do less than your best.''

<HEAD>French President Is Odd Man Out in a Free-Market Chorus</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of
France, who started the decade calling for a ``rupture with
capitalism,'' is still out of step with his summit colleagues as
they march to a fanfare of praise for free-market policies.
   Mitterrand and President Reagan have both attended the past
eight summits. While Reagan prepares for retirement, the
71-year-old Frenchman has just won re-election to a second
seven-year term.
   But the fresh mandate does not seem to have given Mitterrand
greater weight with his peers, or at least not enough to counteract
his isolation as the only leftist among the seven heads of state
and government wrapping up their three-day summit today.
   Mitterrand has abandoned the radical economic policies of
1981-83, his first years in office, but still is a long way from
singing harmony with his conservative colleagues _ especially
Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But at the same time, he no longer needs to fear opposition
within his own delegation. From March 1986 until last month,
Mitterrand was stuck in an uneasy power-sharing arrangement called
``cohabitation'' with Premier Jacques Chirac, an enthusiastic
follower of Reagan- and Thatcher-style economics.
   Chirac started selling off many of the banks and industries
nationalized by the Socialists, but that was ended by Mitterrand's
re-election last month and his appointment of Socialist Michel
Rocard as premier in a new government.
   The French newspaper Le Monde published a front-page cartoon
showing an absent-minded Reagan greeting Mitterrand at the summit's
opening and saying, ``I don't see Jacques Chirac. Is he sick?''
   At the summit, Mitterrand has been the odd man out on
non-economic issues as well.
   He objected to a U.S. proposal to create a seven-nation task
force on drugs, spokesman Hubert Vedrine said, because he does not
think the annual summits should take on duties and activities
during the rest of the year.
   Rather than veto the proposal, Mitterrand abstained on a
watered-down version that did not specify which nations might be
members, even though he still was opposed in principle, the
spokesman said.
   ``France abstained to let this text pass,'' Vedrine said. ``The
fight against drugs is too important for us to block progress for
whatever reason.''
   Vedrine said Mitterrand was pleased by the summit's declaration
Monday on relations with the Soviet Union, saying the seven leaders
have come around to agree with the French president's desire to
improve relations with the East bloc.
   American and British officials, however, said it was the tough
Western stands of previous years that helped bring about changes in
the Soviet Union that make better relations possible.
   Aside from his political differences with his colleagues,
Mitterrand also faces a language barrier. He speaks only French, so
the only summit leaders with whom he can converse without an
interpreter are Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is
fluently bilingual, and Jacques Delors, the Frenchman who heads the
European Economic Community.
   Mitterrand's austere style also clashes with Reagan's hearty
cheer and with Thatcher's uncompromising directness, so that after
nearly a decade together at the summit, there is little apparent
warmth between them.
   At this year's summit, Mitterrand's chief goal was an initiative
to relieve the debts of the world's poorest nations, including many
former French colonies in Africa.
   Officials from other delegations said some debt proposal was
sure to win approval, but not in the form Mitterrand proposed in a
letter to his colleagues two weeks ago.
   ``Mitterrand is very associated with this issue and his views on
it are respected,'' said a Canadian official, speaking on condition
of anonymity _ and leaving unspoken the implication that his views
on economics get less attention.

   ``Red Heat,'' ``Big'' and ``The Great
Outdoors'' were the top box office attractions last weekend.
   Receipts for ``Red Heat,'' a law-and-order movie teaming Arnold
Schwarzenegger's Moscow policeman with Jim Belushi's Chicago cop,
totaled $8.1 million.
   Tom Hanks' movie ``Big'' remained in second place with $6.6
million in ticket sales.
   ``The Great Outdoors,'' starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy,
earning $6.12 million for its first week. The John Hughes movie is
about a slob whose family vacation in Wisconsin is disrupted by his
uppity brother-in-law.
   The success of ``Red Heat'' and ``The Great Outdoors'' came at
the expense of ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' which slipped from first
to fourth, earning $6.11 million.
   ``Big Business,'' starring Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler in dual
roles as two sets of mismatched twins, earned more than $5 million
for fifth place.
   ``Bull Durham,'' the baseball-and-romance story starring Kevin
Costner and Susan Sarandon, stayed out of the minor leagues by
selling about $5 million in tickets.
   Rounding out the top 10 list of earners for last weekend were
``Willow'' in seventh place with $2.9 million, ``Funny Farm'' with
$2.77 million, ``Rambo III'' with $2.745 million and ``The
Presidio'' with $2.742 million.

down-and-out private eye trying to save the marriage of a cartoon
character. The movie mixes animation with live sequences.

   Democratic presidential contender Jesse
Jackson visited a farm near here and criticized Reagan
administration farm policies that he said have left farmers more
vulnerable to the drought.
   Jackson examined the stunted corn crop at the farm of Dale and
Nancy Snesrud and called for a moratorium on farm foreclosures. He
said debt-ridden farmers hit hard by the drought could now fall
victim to land speculators.
   ``What we must do is declare a moratorium on foreclosures,''
Jackson said. ``There is nothing we can do about an act of God. But
we must stop an act of the devil.''
   Jackson blamed administration policies in part for driving
650,000 farmers out of business in the past eight years. He said
those farmers who have survived have no financial cushion to carry
them through the drought.
   ``If we can come up with creative ways to bail out Chrysler and
Continental Bank, we can bail out family farmers and ranchers,''
said Jackson. ``It's a matter of who our country comes to the aid
of.''
   To avoid drought-related livestock losses and curb the expected
increase in meat prices later this year, Jackson said the
government should free surplus grain for feed to make up for
expected low crop yields.
   Snesrud, who raises livestock, corn and soybeans on 230 acres,
said his crops will be severely damaged unless there's a good
rainfall in the next 10 to 14 days.
   Jackson said urban consumers will share the burden of the
drought when the grocery prices increase during the fall and
winter, with the brunt of the blow taken by people on fixed
incomes, he said.
   ``We have to take action before the impact takes place,'' said
Jackson, who led a brief prayer for rain. ``What is happening in
the field has an impact on the entire country.''
   The candidate also spoke Monday in Minneapolis to the 24th
annual convocation of the Opportunities Industrialization Centers
of America, a non-profit organization of vocational schools that
serves the needy.
   ``It's dark and we've got to hold on until morning comes,''
Jackson said. ``You never have a right to do less than your best.''
   He urged the crowd to ask presidential candidates, ``Where do I
fit in your budget?''
   Jackson touted his own budget plan, which would include more
spending on social programs and freezing the military budget.
   The Democratic presidential hopeful was spending today in
California, but had no campaign appearances planned. He scheduled a
meeting with rival Michael Dukakis, aides said.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
will return from next month from Washington, where he is being
treated for terminal liver cancer, and continue in office, his son
says.
   Alejandro Duarte told a news conference Monday that his
62-year-old father will return between July 5 and July 8 and
immediately resume his duties.
   ``His intellectual capacity is not affected by the treatment; in
fact it is admirable,'' said the younger Duarte.
   ``My father is a fighter,'' he said, emphasizing that doctors
say a cancer patient's will and morale are a big factor in the
prognosis.
   The younger Duarte said chemotherapy could extend his father's
life well into next year. He said that according to statistics, the
president could reasonably expect to live between six and 18 months.
   Duarte's five-year term ends June 1, 1989.
   He said his father ``will have to organize his work
differently'' but that chemotherapy would not prevent him from
carrying out his work.
   Duarte has spent the last three weeks in Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in Washington. He underwent surgery earlier this
month to remove most of his stomach, also affected by cancer.
   Duarte plans to return to Walter Reed in August, but his later
treatment would be in El Salvador, his son said.
   At home, the president faces a persistent 8-year-old leftist
guerrilla insurgency and divisions within his Christian Democratic
Party.
   The party is sharply split over who will be its presidential
candidate in March 1989 elections. The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance handed the Christian Democrats a stunning
defeat in municipal and legislative elections held in March and is
considered likely to win the presidency.
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount is the acting
president in Duarte's absence.

   This was supposed to be the year of
optimism, with debt down, spirits up and many farmers expecting
good crops and good prices in 1988. But now Wayne Wietbrock will
settle for less. Breaking even.
   Along with thousands of farmers across the Midwest, Wietbrock
has seen the drought curl corn leaves and trap soybeans under dried
chunks of cracked gray soil in his fields. A brief rain Monday, he
said, did little to help.
   Wietbrock, a third-generation grain farmer in northwest Indiana,
said if there's no break in the dry spell, he could lose 30 percent
of his corn.
   But he added: ``If I can break even ... I'll count myself OK. So
many farmers just went completely bankrupt. Maybe we feel good just
by staying where we are.''
   Still, the Midwest's worst drought in 50 years comes as many
farmers, having survived the mid-1980s' tough times, are finally
making a dent in their debt and starting back toward recovery.
   ``It's very frustrating for farmers just coming out of several
years of low prices and a high debt situation,'' said Dennis
Vercler, Illinois Farm Bureau spokesman.
   ``This is the year we looked at ... as starting to recover,''
said Rex Barnes, a farmer near New Hampshire, Ohio. ``If you don't
have anything to sell, it doesn't mean anything if prices are
high.''
   Many experts say it's too early to tell what the impact will be
because heavy rains in coming weeks could leave farmers in
reasonably good shape. But more dry weather could cause irreparable
financial damage in the Farm Belt.
   ``If we adopt a worst case scenario ... this could be a setback
for the financial recovery side of agriculture,'' said Neil Harl,
an Iowa State University economics professor.
   For farmers ``who were just barely making it, this may be the
marginal blow that puts the person in a place where they may not
continue.''
   After the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, strong hog and cattle
profits, good yields and price support programs contributed to a
record $44.9 billion net farm income in 1987, Harl said, while farm
debt fell by $30 billion.
   Harl said 1987 was a record year for reducing farm debt, which
was about $158 billion at the end of last year, compared with $216
billion in 1983.
   In Iowa, he added, the latest figures show 21 percent of farmers
with substantial financial problems, compared with more than 30
percent in 1985-86.
   If the drought continues, farmers will have less crop to deliver
to the market and that means less income to spend on Main Street.
   Experts say the next few weeks are critical because the summer
is usually very dry in the Farm Belt.
   ``Unless we have an unusually wet July and August, we're almost
assured of having serious troubles,'' Harl said.
   Many farmers, including Tim Abraham, of Lorain County, Ohio,
already have lowered their expectations.
   ``Financially, we could salvage the year _ we could break
even,'' he said. ``As far as making any large profits, that's gone.
Right now, most people are willing or more than willing to accept a
break-even year.''
   Another Ohio farmer, John Bergman, of St. Marys, agrees.
   ``If things keep up the way they are, we will definitely suffer
a lot,'' he said. ``It'll set us back several years. We're not
going to lose the place. (But) we're not going to forge ahead.''
   Wietbrock, 58, said if he goes this year without profits, he
won't be able to buy machinery and will make other sacrifices.
Still, he said he considers himself lucky because many others have
been forced out of farming.
   ``The family farm is a struggle for a lot of us to stay on,'' he
said. ``I look around here ... and do not see any young farmer,
under 40 years old. There's no young ones coming on. Something like
this ... is going to further discourage others.''
   Wietbrock also said he doesn't worry about the weather because,
``It isn't going to make it rain any more.''
   ``A farmer is the eternal optimist,'' he added. ``He has to
think next year will be better.''

<HEAD>Midwest Misery Could Benefit Northwest Farmers</HEAD>

   Many Northwest farmers stand to benefit
from the drought that's laying waste to crops in the Midwest, but
they could easily become victims of the weather themselves,
agricultural experts say.
   Sparse rainfall and record heat have left the nation's heartland
parched, and some states anticipate losing 40 percent of this
year's farm revenue. But Oregon and Washington state farmers were
blessed with late spring rains and cooler temperatures that boosted
some crops but damaged others, such as cherries.
   Washington State Grange Master Ray Hill is one who stands to
both benefit and lose because of the drought.
   Hill, a wheat grower and cattle rancher, said he will make more
money this year on wheat, which is selling at nearly $1 a bushel
more than last year due to the anticipated shortfall from the
drought.
   But he probably will lose money on his cattle because Midwest
farmers are sending to market steers they are unable to feed from
parched fields. Beef prices, which were peaking, could become
depressed as the Midwest stock comes on the market, he said.
   As for wheat, ``the picture is brighter than it has been in a
long time,'' he said.
   ``It is definitely having a (beneficial) impact on our prices,''
said Thomas Mick, the Washington Wheat Commission's administrator.
``We hate to reap benefit off somebody else's misfortune, but the
futures prices of wheat are rising dramatically (because of the
drought), and our wheat prices are based on those.''
   Last year farmers received about $2.60 per bushel. They are now
looking at $3.35 to $3.50 a bushel, Mick said. It is possible price
rises will continue through the August harvest of Washington's and
Oregon's predominantly soft white variety of wheat, used for
noodles and pasta.
   Midwest farmers grow a hard red variety that's used primarily in
bread.
   Mick and Hill said Washington state growers still face potential
crop losses because of weather. If recent hot, dry weather
continues it could stress the crop, but nothing like the Midwest
drought.
   ``We've been lucky for the last three harvests,'' said Mick.
``We barely made a crop, then received extremely timely rains.
Going into April, we were in a drought situation ourselves. The
rains in April, May and June saved the crops.''
   Because of various government land set-aside programs, the total
Washington state wheat acreage is at its lowest in two decades, but
the total yield for the state is expected to be average or just
below average, Mick said.
   Barley and corn growers also should benefit, Mick said, because
barley prices are closely related to corn prices and the Midwest
corn crop has been severely hurt by the drought.
   Although the prices paid for wheat are expected to rise,
consumers should barely feel the increase, Mick said.
   Mick said a $1 hike in the price of a bushel of wheat represents
an increase of about 1{ cents in the price of a loaf of bread, he
said.

<TEXT>
   An eight-story building only 150 yards from the
hotel where President Reagan is staying for the economic summit
caught fire early Tuesday, but the blaze was brought under control
within an hour of the initial alarm, officials said.
   The fire, which broke out in vacant building, sent burning
cinders showering hundreds of yards down Bay Street, in the heart
of Toronto's financial district.
   The building was located only 1{ blocks from the Royal York,
where Reagan is staying. The fire was four blocks from the
Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center, the site of the
seven-nation economic summit. Dozens of TV crews, both local and
foreign, ran the four blocks to film the blaze.
   Officials at the site said the fire was under control within an
hour of the initial alarm.
   Sgt. Rick Morris of the summit security force said there was no
connection between the fire and the summit meeting.
   Fire officials said they had asked for the arson squad to
investigate whether the fire had been deliberately set.

<HEAD>High Court's Ruling Unravels Years of Litigation in Desgregation
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than seven years of dispute,
a lawsuit seeking to desegregate Alabama's universities is back
where it began and is headed for a new trial as a result of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling.
   The court, without comment, refused on Monday to alter a ruling
that a federal judge who found ``vestiges of segregation'' in the
state's schools should not have presided over the case.
   Officials from both sides of the lawsuit are working toward
reaching a settlement, said Gov. Guy Hunt's legal adviser, Mark
Montiel.
   Montiel declined to discuss specifics that might help or impede
a settlement.
   ``It's going to take a cooperative effort to resolve it,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of sitting down and working toward that
goal.''
   Auburn University officials would not comment on pending
litigation.
   In 1983, the Reagan administration sued the state's higher
education system, alleging racial discrimination. The lawsuit was
filed after two years of efforts to settle the case among the
college presidents and state school officials failed.
   U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon, the first black federal trial
judge in Alabama, ruled after a 22-day trial in 1985 that
authorities would have to take steps to racially integrate such
state-run schools as Auburn, the University of Alabama and Troy
State. Clemon described Auburn as the state's most segregated
university, an opinion now void.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last Oct. 6
that Clemon should have disqualified himself because as a former
state legislator, he ``actively participated in the very events and
shaped the very facts that are at issue in this suit.''
   Clemon once served as chairman of the state Senate Rules
Committee. In that role, the appeals court said, he ``played a
critical role in the confirmation of those individuals nominated
for positions on the board of trustees of the defendant
institutions.''
   The appeals court, however, rejected arguments that Clemon
should have disqualified himself because of his past civil rights
activity and because his children may some day attend some of the
schools involved.
   ``To disqualify minority judges from major civil rights
litigation solely because of their minority status is
intolerable,'' the appellate court said.
   The appellate ruling sent the case back for a new trial before
U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer Jr. of Birmingham.
   The appeal acted on Monday was filed by Alabama State University
and Alabama A&M University, two predominantly black schools.
Officials at both schools say their integration attempts have been
thwarted by official state policies, and individuals.
   The 11th Circuit ruled that the two schools could not bring suit
against the state that created the institutions.

   Whatever the final communique says today, host
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney may remember the 14th economic summit
with gratitude.
   In a crucial special parliamentary election Monday in Quebec,
Mulroney's handpicked candidate, Lucien Bouchard, won with ease,
ending a series of reversals for Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party.
   In addition, summit partners signaled a general endorsement of
the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which has run into all-out
political opposition at home and will be the biggest issue in a
general election Mulroney must call by September 1989.
   Mulroney had put his personal credibility on the line in the
election in Lac Saint-Jean, Quebec, and he shared news of the
victory with summit partners at dinner.
   Defeat for the Conservatives would have been a humiliation for
the prime minister, who campaigned extensively in the district and
showered it with $135 million in federal projects.
   In March, Bouchard was brought back from Paris, where he was
Canadian ambassador to France, and Mulroney appointed his old
friend to the Cabinet as secretary of state. Cabinet ministers must
be members of Parliament, and another Conservative resigned to let
Bouchard run in Lac Saint-Jean.
   Known as the ``Mr. Clean'' of Quebec politics, Bouchard will be
a key lieutenant for Mulroney in the general election.
   ``I'm very happy. Mr. Bouchard is an excellent Quebecer and
Canadian who can render great service to Canada's unity,'' Mulroney
told reporters.
   A Mulroney aide later visited the prime minister and said:
``He's not crowing or gloating but he's got his shirt off and his
feet up and he says maybe now people will start seeing things the
way he has.''
   Most Canadian governments run for four years of their five-year
terms when the prime minister calls an election to seek a new
mandate.
   Mulroney swept to power in September 1984, but has hesitated to
call an election because opinion polls show the Conservatives
trailing the main opposition Liberal Party with just 30 percent
voter support.
   The Liberals, and the socialist opposition New Democratic Party,
have said they would tear up the Free Trade Agreement Mulroney
negotiated with the Reagan administration and which would dismantle
trade barriers over the next decade.
   Mulroney's opponents accuse him of sacrificing Canadian
sovereignty in the deal.
   The New Democrats also oppose Canadian membership in NATO.
   With the election win, trade endorsement and successfully hosted
summit, one Mulroney aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
commented: ``You would think these things would have a great impact
on the opinion polls.''

   A man accused of imprisoning six women as
sex slaves in a basement torture chamber is guilty but insane, his
attorney says, but the prosecutor in the torture-murder trial says
the man knew what he was doing.
   Gary Michael Heidnik, a self-styled minister and a financial
whiz, sat unmoved during opening statements Monday. He faces two
counts of homicide, six of kidnapping, six of rape and four of
aggravated assault.
   ``The evidence will show that this defendant committed repeated
sadistic and malicious acts causing the torture and death of two
victims (and) he did it methodically and systematically and
deliberately concealed it,'' Assistant District Attorney Charles
Gallagher told the Common Pleas Court jurors.
   ``He knew what he was doing. He knew it was wrong and didn't
want to be discovered,'' Gallagher said.
   Heidnik, 44, an Army veteran on permanent disability, kept six
women captive in the basement of his home here and raped them
repeatedly, police said.
   ``My client is not innocent,'' defense attorney A. Charles
Peruto Jr. said. ``We are not relying on that presumption. He is
very, very guilty. This is not a case of whodunit. This is a case
of why it was done. He is relying on a defense of mental infirmity.
His criminal acts will show him to be insane.''
   Peruto added, ``Someone who puts human remains and dog food in a
food processor as a gourmet meal for a celebration party has got to
be out to lunch.''
   Peruto is trying to save Heidnik from the electric chair.
   Heidnik is charged with murdering Sandra Lindsay, 24, who was
strangled while chained to a pipe, and Debbi Johnson, 23, who was
electrocuted while standing in a water-filled pit.
   Among the first prosecution witnesses was Josefina Rivera, a
27-year-old prostitute, who said she was the first woman Heidnik
lured to his basement, in November 1986, and the one who eventually
escaped and brought police to free three others.
   She testified she was present when Ms. Lindsay died chained to
the pipe Feb. 7, 1987.
   ``He hung her there to punish her for making noises, and when
she passed out, Heidnik came down and asked how long she was like
that,'' Ms. Rivera testified. ``He unlocked her handcuff and he
released it she crashed to the floor. Then he picked her up and he
said she was dead.''
   Police say Heidnik then used a chain saw to hack apart Ms.
Lindsay's body, feeding some to his dogs and captives.
   When Heidnik was arrested, 24 pounds of human limbs were found
in the basement freezer and other body parts were discovered in a
kitchen refrigerator, police say.

   Time flies, but those earthbound spend about
five years of their lives standing in lines and six months sitting
at stoplights, according to a time management expert who says every
minute counts.
   ``Most people don't realize how much time they're wasting,''
said Michael Fortino, president of the consulting firm Priority
Management Pittsburgh Inc. ``The whole point is to spend time doing
the things that you want to do rather than the things you dislike.''
   To determine how time is spent, Priority Management researchers,
often with stopwatch in hand, studied hundreds of people around the
nation for more than a year, Fortino said Monday.
   The study estimated the average person spends six months at
stoplights, eight months opening junk mail, one year searching for
misplaced objects, two years trying to return telephone calls to
people who never seem to be in, four years doing housework, five
years in line and six years eating.
   To determine which fast-food giants are the fastest, University
of Pittsburgh business students commissioned by Priority Management
timed clerks at Wendy's, McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in
Pittsburgh at least 100 times each.
   Wendy's won, taking an average 46 seconds to serve a hamburger,
french fries and soft drink. It took 1{ minutes at McDonald's and
three minutes at Burger King.
   ``If we realize we're wasting five years standing in line, we
can shift our time, attend a more efficient grocery store or more
effective bank,'' Fortino said.
   Many people spend relatively little time on things they say they
value, Fortino said.
   Priority Management conducted a telephone survey of more than
1,000 married people and marriage guidance counselors across the
nation. The study estimates the average married couple spends four
minutes a day in meaningful conversation and the working couple
spends 30 seconds a day talking with their children.
   ``Most people say their families are important, but they don't
live that way,'' Fortino said. ``Schedule a dinner with your family
and commit to it as if it were a dinner appointment with a major
corporate executive.''

<HEAD>Crew Of Ship That Hit Iranian Mine Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crew members of the USS Samuel B. Roberts
hit the shore for a monthlong vacation after arriving home to
balloons and flowers for the first time since the Navy frigate hit
a mine in the Persian Gulf in April.
   The 140 sailors were greeted Monday night by more than 350
whooping wives, girlfriends and other relatives as they arrived
here at T.F. Green State Airport after the long flight from Dubai
in the gulf.
   ``It's great to be back! I'm going to a Cubs game,'' one sailor
shouted.
   On April 14, while on escort duty in the gulf, the
guided-missile vessel hit a mine that tore a 22- to 25-foot hole in
its bottom, flooded its engine room and set a fire that took five
hours to control.
   The blast injured 10 crew members, two critically. All have
since recovered, Navy officials said.
   In retaliation for the mine, which Navy officials said was laid
by Iran, the United States destroyed two Iranian offshore platforms
and sank or crippled six Iranian ships.
   Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell III, commander of the Atlantic
fleet's surface forces, praised the crew Monday, calling them
``clearly national heroes.''
   ``The ship would have sunk had it not been for the crew, there's
no question about that,'' Donnell said.
   The crew had to deploy small propellers driven by electric
motors to get out of the mine field, control a fire that was
feeding on engine fuel, shore up buckling bulkheads next to the
flooded engine room, and weld new plates and heavy wire to cracks
to hold the ship together.
   ``We did a job that we're supposed to do,'' said Richard
Raymond, 26, an operations specialist from Spotswood, N.J.
   But some said the ordeal was as harrowing as their family and
friends had imagined.
   ``The fires were really getting out of control, and the
flooding,'' said Scot Joseph, 20, a ship's cook from New Bedford,
Mass. ``We weren't sure if we were going to stay afloat.''
   ``We felt right until they pumped the water out in the drydock
(two days after hitting the mine) that we were at risk,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. John Eckelberry, the ship's executive officer.
   About 30 crew members were chosen to stay with the frigate when
it returns Sunday to the United States.
   The ship is expected to arrive at its home port of Newport about
40 days later, Navy officials said. In October, it will be sent to
the Bath Iron Works in Portland, Maine, for repairs that could take
a year, Donnell said.
   The crew will be on leave until the Roberts arrives in Newport,
and then will be assigned to stay with the ship while it is being
repaired, said Donnell.

   When a civilian president dares to
tangle with a military chief in a country with Haiti's political
history, the winner is not difficult to predict.
   This week's military coup by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who led the
nation's three-man ruling junta for two years until January, was
the latest in a series of bitter disappointments for
democratic-minded Haitians.
   It ended the nation's experiment with more than four months of
nominal civilian rule and restored the army's almost uninterrupted
political monopoly since independence in 1804.
   Namphy proclaimed a military government whose Cabinet includes
just one civilian and declared himself president on Monday, only a
few hours after easily deposing President Leslie Manigat.
   The army's latest occupation of the national palace shows
Haiti's 6 million mostly illiterate and poverty-stricken people
that little has apparently changed since they ran joyously through
the streets in February 1986, celebrating the departure of
Jean-Claude Duvalier and the end of the 29-year dictatorship
founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   Twice in the past seven months, Haitians have had reason to hope
democracy might finally be realized _ the days before thwarted
elections in November, and last week when Manigat briefly asserted
civilian control over the military.
   Both times, Haitians were abruptly and violently deprived of
that hope.
   Manigat, a 57-year-old political scientist, was elected Jan. 17,
in fraud-riddled elections. The ballotting was nevertheless the
first that even hinted at democracy in almost 30 years.
   Though critics said Manigat was put in power by the military, he
promised to reorganize the 7,000-man army and make it work toward
developing the country.
   Even some of his critics cheered his attempt last week to assert
civilian control over the military, saying it confirmed his
assertions he was not a military puppet.
   He began Wednesday by overruling a decision made by Namphy, the
military commander. On Friday, he fired Namphy and put him under
house arrest.
   Manigat's audacity provoked a swift reaction. On Sunday, when he
sought to transfer many of Namphy's allies to lesser posts, the
army rebelled and returned Namphy to power.
   Two years earlier, Namphy also raised the hopes of many Haitians
by promising to restore democracy and cede power to a
freely-elected government.
   He released political prisoners and pledged to try to recover
millions of dollars from the Duvaliers, who left the country's
economy and agriculture in ruins.
   But his 24 months at Haiti's helm were marred by constitutional
violations and arbitrary arrests, as well as assassinations of
political leaders, peasants and demonstrators.
   Meanwhile, there was little change in the living conditions of
the hungry and homeless masses.
   In June 1987, Namphy's government tried to take control of
national elections and in July his troops killed more than 100
demonstrators who were demanding he step down.
   On Nov. 29, months of enthusiasm and joy at the prospect of the
country's first genuinely free elections were shattered in an orgy
of blood and death.
   While Namphy's soldiers stood by or helped, armed thugs shot and
hacked to death more than 30 voters.
   The massacre terrorized Haitians and provoked outrage abroad.
When asked to go to the polls again Jan. 17 in army-supervised
voting, the most popular candidates refused to run and few Haitians
bothered to go to the polls.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divorces in South Korea soared by 33
percent last year, with infidelity being cited as the most common
reason for dissolved marriages, court figures show.
   The Supreme Court reported that 54,762 couples divorced in 1987
compared to 41,240 divorces the year before.
   South Korea's rising divorce rate appears to reflect the decline
of traditional values and the impact of Western lifestyles as well
as growing prosperity and the pressures of modern, urban life.
   Court officials said infidelity was cited in 47.3 percent of the
divorces, followed by desertion in 22.4 cases, mistreatment in 12.2
percent.
   Mistreatment of a spouse's parents was cited as the reason in
5.5 percent of divorce cases. Some elderly people live with their
married children, causing domestic tension.

<HEAD>Malpractice Insurance Cost Cutting Maternal Care, HHS Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's health chief says the
availability of maternal care in rural and inner-city areas is
being especially hurt by the soaring cost of medical malpractice
insurance.
   ``With family physicians often the only ones to serve an area,
numerous counties or entire regions of some states report that they
have just one or two physicians to deliver babies,'' Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said on Monday.
   Bowen's remarks to an Institute of Medicine symposium were based
largely on an HHS task force report on medical malpractice
insurance issued last August.
   Bowen told the opening session of the symposium the American
Academy of Family Physicians reported last year that 18.6 percent
of its members have dropped their obstetrical practice due to the
cost of liability insurance or an inability to get malpractice
insurance.
   The independent Institute of Medicine is studying the effect of
malpractice insurance issues on the delivery of maternal and child
health care.

<HEAD>Recall Ordered for Scuba Dry Suits Using Single Air Control Valve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered the recall of scuba
diving dry suits using air control valves made by Diving Unlimited
International because malfunctioning valves may cause serious
injury or death.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday that owners
of dry suits with AC (air control) valves made by the San
Diego-based Diving Unlimited International Inc. ``should
immediately stop using the dry suits.''
   The commission said there have been 16 incidents associated with
malfunctioning of the valve, which deflates or inflates the dry
suits to equalize air pressure while divers ascend or descend in
water.
   The commission said that unlike air control systems which use
two separate valves, DUI's one-valve system may cause ``air to fill
the dry suit, resulting in the diver rising rapidly to the surface
or failing to provide sufficient air to maintain buoyancy.''
   DUI says owners of suits with the company's valve should return
their suits to the company and the valve will be replaced at no
charge.
   DUI can be contacted at 800-327-8439, the commission at
800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Washington Post Poll Puts Dukakis Well Ahead Of Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush has slightly improved
his standing but still trails Democratic presidential contender
Michael Dukakis by double digits, a new poll published today by The
Washington Post indicates.
   The latest poll suggests Dukakis leads Bush 51 percent to 39
percent. In a similar survey on May 25, the Massachusetts governor
was ahead of the vice president by just a bit more _ 53 to 40
percent.
   The Post poll suggests that Bush is significantly better known
than Dukakis. Ten percent of the voters said they know a great deal
about Dukakis, compared to 29 percent for Bush.
   The survey suggested that only half the supporters of both
candidates described themselves as ``strong'' supporters of the
candidate of their choice, with the remainder saying their
preference is ``not strong.''
   The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was conducted from
Wednesday to Sunday. Of those, 782 were registered voters.
   For results based on the entire sample, the margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points. It was 4 percentage points for
registered voters.

<HEAD>Drought Hurting Bush's Chances?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican congressman says drought
conditions in the Midwest could cripple Vice President George
Bush's chances of winning election as president.
   ``There's no question that a drought fairly early on hurts the
party in power,'' Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said Monday.
   ``Fairly or unfairly, we (Republicans) have been accused over
the last eight to 10 years of moving out the bad farm managers,''
he said.
   Gunderson said the Reagan administration must help farmers
withstand the drought because ``I don't think you can justify
putting farmers out of business because of circumstances beyond
their control, such as the weather.''
   He said the drought could make Bush choose former rival Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole as his running mate because of Dole's support in the
farm community.

<HEAD>Democrats Ponder Rules Violation By Maine Delegation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic officials are being asked to decide
whether members of Maine's delegation should be seated at the
national party convention even though the state party ignored a key
rule in selecting delegates.
   ``They may not meet the letter of the ... rule, but they meet
the spirit of the rule,'' said Estelle A. Lavoie, a Portland,
Maine, attorney told a national party hearing officer on Monday.
   Hearing officer John Nolan said he would make a report to the
convention's rules committee before its meeting here on Thursday.
If Maine is judged in violation of the rules, it could lose its
four seats for Democratic National Committee members at the
convention.
   The state convention in May selected 23 delegates, giving 11 to
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, nine to Jesse Jackson and 3 to
an uncommitted group.
   Under national rules, the uncommitted group would not have won
any delegates, since they had only 13 percent of the state
convention delegates _ below the 15 percent national minimum. But
the Maine rules specifically rejected any minimum threshold for
winning national delegates.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-six percent of Mexican voters favor
governing party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 6
presidential election, according to a Gallup poll touted as the
most ambitious ever in Mexico.
   Leftist coalition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas trailed at 23
percent, and conservative National Action Party candidate Manuel
Clouthier was preferred by 19 percent of voters, according to
survey, which was published Monday night by the government news
agency Notimex.
   Two other presidential hopefuls, Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the
radical Revolutionary Workers' Party and Gumersindo Magana of the
conservative Mexican Democratic Party, each received 1 percent of
voter support in the poll.
   As the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
Salinas de Gortari is virtually certain of victory over four
opposition candidates. The party, known by its Spanish initials
PRI, has not lost a presidential, gubernatorial or senate election
since it was founded in 1929.
   Another poll published by the Mexico City newspaper El Universal
found near-identical vote totals for the leading candidates. That
survey, conducted in 44 of Mexico's most important cities, gave
Salinas de Gortari the support of 56.2 percent of voters. Cardenas
placed second at 21.6 percent.
   The nationwide Gallup survey was billed as the ``most ambitious
ever realized'' in Mexico. It was conducted between May 12 and June
1 for ECO, Inc., a Los Angeles-based affiliate of the private
Televisa television network, which is closely aligned with the
government.
   A total of 2,960 registered voters were asked to answer 70
questions indicating their voting preferences, opinions on the
leadership and personal qualities of the candidates, and background
information on their incomes and professions.
   The news agency did not provide a margin of error.
   Salinas de Gortari also polled first in personal and leadership
characteristics, such as familiarity with Mexico's problems,
leadership, honesty, and ``love for Mexico.''
   Among those who voted in 1982 for then-candidate Miguel de La
Madrid, the current president, 77 percent said they plan to vote
for Salinas de Gortari.
   Jorge de la Vega, president of the party's national executive
committee, predicted Monday that the party would obtain the votes
of 20 million of Mexico's 38 million registered voters in July.

<HEAD>Haiti's Military Ruler Proud, Forceful And Patriotic</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Haiti, Bjt</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, publicly
running Haiti again after four months of civilian government, is a
55-year-old career soldier associates describe as forceful,
dedicated and patriotic.
   Namphy returned to power early Monday in a coup that deposed the
civilian president to whom he transferred power in February. He had
run the government since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the
ocuntry Feb. 7, 1986.
   The general, who had commanded Duvalier's armed forces, appeared
on television a few hours after Duvalier left in a U.S. Air Force
plane to announce formation of a provisional council that would
govern and arrange a ``fair, good and firm transition to
democracy.''
   He was president of the council, which eventually was reduced to
a three-man junta, and turned over power Feb. 7 to President Leslie
Manigat, who was elected the previous month with the army's help.
   Namphy is a solidly built man of medium height with steel-gray
eyes and closely cropped, graying hair.
   During his two years in the National Palace, Namphy told
associates he preferred life at home or in the barracks and spent
weekends at his house with friends, relaxing in his pool. He and
his wife, Gabrielle, have an 11-year-old daughter, Melissa.
   Born into a lower-middle class family in northern Haiti, Namphy
attended a Roman Catholic elementary school in Port-au-Prince and
the Haitian military academy. He speaks French, Creole and Spanish.
   At age 22, Namphy was commissioned a lieutenant by Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father.
   In 1982, as a colonel, he led the campaign against a small band
of rebels who landed in northern Haiti. He was promoted to
lieutenant general and, soon after, to chief of staff.
   ``If I had to choose, being president of this country is not
what I would have chosen,'' Namphy said in an interview with The
Associated Press in October 1986. ``I have only one thing to say to
whoever is going to become president: Don't be late for the
inauguration, because I'm not going to wait around.
   ``At my age I have never voted. I don't know what voting is
about. I have to have my own civic education and if I need that,
you have to believe the people need that too.''
   He has shown little trust in democratic processes and appears to
prefer ruling by decree.
   When it was obvious that strongly anti-Duvalier candidates had
the best chance of winning elections Nov. 29, 1987, Namphy tried to
seize control from the independent Electoral Council. Soldiers
killed at least 30 people when Haitians held demonstrations that,
combined with diplomatic pressure, forced Namphy to back down.
   He looked the other way as pro-Duvalier elements, prohibited by
the new constitution from running for office, mounted a terror
campaign against the election.
   The Electoral Council's headquarters was burned and its members
went into hiding. On election day, soldiers and thugs killed at
least 34 voters and the election was called off three hours after
it began.
   Namphy dissolved the Electoral Council and appointed a new
electoral body to hold the Jan. 17 elections.

   A relic from a Las Vegas casino and a garish
still life bought in Paris are among the ``treasures'' to be
auctioned next month in the first Ugly Art Show and Auction.
   Organizers promise the show and auction will be the ``maddest,
the meanest and the prettiest auction.''
   Pastor David Eberhard, who also is a member of the Detroit City
Council, said he hopes the July 20 sale of the bad-taste pieces
will raise $10,000 for the $2 million project at the historic
Trinity Lutheran Church.
   Among the ugliest pieces revealed Monday were a bas-relief slab
painted in dull gold depicting what looked like the Greek god
Poseidon riding a sea monster. The item once was part of a casino's
decor.
   Also available are a picture of a Hawaiian sunset encased in a
cheap pseudo-wood frame and a painting of a ``really ugly fish,''
said Ron Hoffman, a member of the church's Ugly Art Committee,
which solicited the donations.
   The fish painting was donated by restaurateur Joe Muer, whose
brother Chuck, also a restaurateur, donated a flower still life,
which he bought in Paris in 1964.
   Perhaps the least offensive piece is a linen table napkin
autographed by opera star Luciano Pavarotti, who sang in Detroit
earlier this month. It was donated by committee members F. Edward
and Denise Lucas.

   An affluent suburb trying to spruce up its
neighborhoods is having second thoughts about a law that bars
pickup trucks from parking overnight in front of homes or in
driveways, the mayor says.
   Citing a need for ``equity for pickup owners,'' Nichols Hills
Mayor Mac Maguire said Monday he and other town leaders will use a
90-day moratorium to review the ordinance and how it affects
residents.
   The city adopted an ordinance several years ago to prohibit
pickup trucks from parking in driveways or in front of homes
between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   At a recent meeting, the city council unanimously agreed to the
moratorium because of complaints by residents who owned pickups and
had received tickets for parking illegally outside their homes.
   ``I don't think our citizens want the city to look unattractive
in any way, but they have a right to protect their property, and
they should have a place to park their vehicles,'' Maguire said.
``I think the issue ought to be studied to see if there isn't some
way we can achieve what the citizens want.
   ``I don't believe we want to penalize citizens on this issue,
and I think we should listen to what they want.''
   The ordinance's original intent was to prohibit commercial
vehicles from parking in front of homes overnight, Maguire said.
   But it has forced some residents to ``put their pickup in their
garage and their Cadillac in the driveway,'' Councilwoman Ann
Taylor said.

<HEAD>Bloomie's Wraps Up Salute to Kansan Cuisine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Say ``Kansas'' to someone in the Big Apple and
out may pop the words ``Wizard of Oz'' or ``Dorothy and Toto.''
   Probe a little deeper and you might get some comment about
cross-country car trips on highways that are straight as an arrow.
   But gourmet food?
   ``Not many people in the East know us as anything more than
covered wagons,'' said Bob Storey, a lawyer from Topeka, Kan., who
stopped by Bloomingdale's salute to Kansan cuisine with his wife,
Kerry, on a recent trip to Manhattan.
   ``It makes us feel great, proud of Kansas,'' he said.
   The New York-based department store's salute to ``Land of Oz''
delicacies began May 10 and ended Saturday. The promotion included
some of the finest buffalo meat in the country, popping corns that
rival the best anywhere and elegant cream cakes that melt in the
mouth.
   There also were fresh catfish (raised on a farm) and
gum-drop-size cookies that have appeared on the TV series ``Family
Ties.''
   Bloomingdale's, which reordered some Sunflower State specialties
as often as four times, reaped about $150,000 in sales during the
six-week promotion at 15 of its stores. It will continue to sell
the items and expects to ring up an additional $100,000 of Kansan
goods by Dec. 31, said Bill Lane, merchandising manager for the
gourmet food division.
   Why did Bloomingdale's, which has already tipped its hat to
Vermont, Louisiana and Oregon, pick Kansas for its fourth state
promotion in as many years?
   ``When you think of maple syrup, you think of Vermont. When you
think of Kansas, you really don't know,'' said Lane.
   But the store found that Kansas has plenty of downhome food and
a mix of traditional farming values and pioneer spirit that appeals
to its upscale urban customers.
   ``The trend now is for nurturing, comfort foods _ a play on the
food you grew up with, a play on food you understand without
getting a dictionary out,'' Lane said.
   Randall Tosh, the state's director of trade promotion and a
walking-computer on Kansas trivia, called the promotion ``sort of
our Broadway debut.
   ``Bloomingdale's got off the superhighways and traveled the back
roads. They found the small towns and effectively recreated that in
New York.''
   By the end of the promotion, Lane estimated the store had sold
2,000 bottles of Louisburg Cider Mill's sparkling apple and
apple-cranberry juice, 1,800 bottles of Hayward's and Mom's
barbecue sauces, 1,100 bottles of soynuts, 2,500 packages of
microwave popcorn, 250 boxes of Wall-Rogalsky Milling pancake mix
and 40 jars of pecan honey from the West Glen Honey Co.
   Although the store had no homey-looking aprons in its Kansas
displays, there were plenty of green and yellow quilts, bleached
wood tables, carousel horses and flower boxes ``to create an image
of outdoor, farm-like and wholesome,'' Lane said.
   There even was a live horse loose among the store's cosmetic
counters for the promotion's gala opening party at Bloomingdale's
Manhattan store. And a hatmaker, bootmaker, wheat-weaver and
quilter later demonstrated their crafts.
   But it will take more than Bloomie's magic to broaden everyone's
view of Kansas. One shopper in a rush at the Lexington Avenue
store's fresh food counter shot back four words when asked about
Kansas _ ``The Wizard of Oz.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's groups and city officials around the
nation hailed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that cracks open the door
of private all-male clubs to women and minorities by upholding a
ban on exclusive membership policies.
   ``Hallelujah! We've been waiting for this for a long time,''
Mayor Edward I. Koch said Monday. ``Let's open up the doors to
women. They don't bite.''
   ``We feel it's one more nail in the coffin against
discrimination of women in this country,'' said Kelly Conlin,
president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for
Women.
   But members of some of the city's all-male clubs reacted angrily
to the high court decision upholding a 1984 New York City law.
   ``If men want to get together and have a club, what's wrong with
that?'' said a man heading into the New York Athletic Club. Like
all of the nearly two dozen members approached for comment Monday,
he refused to give his name.
   The ruling will strengthen the position of cities across the
country, including Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that are
trying to force large private clubs to comply with ordinances
resembling New York's Local Law 63.
   Buffalo; Sacramento, Calif.; Chicago, Detroit and Washington,
D.C., have or are considering similar laws.
   The New York law bans discrimination in clubs that have more
than 400 members, provide regular meal service and rent their
facilities to non-members for private functions. The New York State
Clubs Association, comprising 125 private clubs and associations,
challenged it almost immediately.
   Beate Bloch, a lawyer who helped represent the U.S. Conference
of Mayors and other governmental organizations in backing the law,
called Monday's ruling a victory that allows cities to enforce
their laws against discrimination.
   In Boston, the last bastions of single-sex socializing have a
month to decide whether to fight or switch in light of the ruling,
said Licensing Board Chairwoman Andrea Gargiulo.
   The Somerset Club and Tavern Club for men and the Chilton Club
for women must decide to comply with the city's policy, or a
hearing will be held to determine whether any club should be
exempted, she said.
   Los Angeles plans to press ahead with a lawsuit accusing the
3,000-member Jonathan Club of violating an anti-discrimination
ordinance by reserving a bar and grill for male members, city
attorney James Hahn said. The club admitted its first female and
black members last summer.
   In San Francisco, city attorney Louise Renne said the ruling
should strengthen the city's lawsuit against the all-male Olympic
Club, from which then-Judge Anthony M. Kennedy resigned shortly
before he was appointed to the Supreme Court last fall.
   That lawsuit does not involve the city's anti-discrimination
ordinance but instead relies on a state law barring discrimination
by businesses.
   New York has invoked the law against four male-only clubs: the
10,003-member New York Athletic Club, the 4,329-member University
Club, the 1,900-member Century Association and the 1,600-member
Union League Club.
   The University Club has since voted to admit women and the
Century Association has said it would pending the high court's
ruling.
   ``The law merely prevents an association from using race, sex or
other specified characteristics as shorthand measures in place of
what the city considers to be more legitimate criteria for
determining membership,'' Justice Byron R. White wrote for the
court.
   Though the court held that the law was constitutional it ``was
careful to point out that specific clubs, depending upon their
facts and circumstances, may mount case-by-case challenges to the
constitutionality of the law,'' said attorney Alan Mansfield, who
represented the clubs association.
   American Bar Association President Rober McCrate, whose
organization had supported the city law, praised the court's
decision.
   ``If women and minorities are to have equal access to the
marketplace,'' McCrate said, ``so-called private clubs that are
common place for business discussions and other activities related
to the marketplace must be subject to anti-discrimination laws.''

   The Metropolitan Opera is planning a part-time
move to the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater as part of
an experiment scheduled to start with the 1991 season.
   The newly restored Majestic will provide the backdrop for new
and small-scale works and for innovative productions that may not
be suitable for performances at the Metropolitan Opera House in
Lincoln Center, said Bruce Crawford, the Met's general manager.
   The arrangement is based on an agreement in principle, and no
contracts have been signed, The New York Times reported today. The
productions are to be jointly presented by the Met and BAM.
   The Majestic has presented vaudeville, movies and plays, and was
restored last year in a post-modernistic style for Peter Brook's
production of ``The Mahabharata.''
   The theater seats 900, compared with 4,000 at the Met in Lincoln
Center. Some of the Brooklyn productions may be staged in the
academy's 2,000-seat Opera House, rather than in the Majestic.
   Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the academy, said more than $2
million has been budgeted for the 1991 season.
   The move would mark a return of sorts for the Met. Even before
the current BAM building opened in 1907, the Met offered Tuesday
night performances in Brooklyn during its regular season. The
visits stopped during the Depression, after the 1936-37 season.

Accident</HEAD>

   Six soldiers killed in a
blast during a training course were working with explosives capable
of blowing up a small house, an official said.
   Three other soldiers were injured in Monday's blast near the
Canadian Forces Base in Chilliwack.
   Killed were second-year officer training cadets in the third day
of a four-day training session on explosives handling, said Lt.
Col. Graham Meharg.
   Further explosives training at the base was suspended pending an
investigation, officials said.
   There were no immediate clues as to what went wrong, Meharg
said. Some survivors were in shock and Meharg would not allow any
of the soldiers to speak with reporters.
   Meharg said he believed the dead included men and women but
refused to provide further details.
   Two of the injured men were listed as stable at Chilliwack
General Hospital and the third, also a man, suffered multiple
fractures and was transfered to a Vancouver hospital, said
Chilliwack hospital spokeswoman Etta Richmond.
   The unit _ 29 students, seven instructors and five support staff
_ was engaged in an exercise known as ``cratering'' when the
explosives went off prematurely on Monday afternoon, Meharg said.
   Cratering requires approximately 60 pounds of plastic explosives
and involves blowing a hole in the ground about 10 or 12 feet wide
and deep, Mehrag said. The amount of explosives was enough to blow
up a small house, he said.
   The accident site, 20 miles southeast of the base, was
immediately cordoned off.
   Among its many functions, the large base at Chilliwack, a city
of more than 40,000 people about 60 miles east of Vancouver, serves
as a training ground for an armed forces officer candidate school
and the school of military engineering. It is also home to No. 1
Combat Engineers Regiment.
   The explosion is the latest in a series of armed forces
accidents involving explosives.
   Earlier this month, six soldiers were injured by exploding
mortar shells during a live ammunition training session at Canadian
Forces Base Gagetown, in New Brunswick.
   The soldiers, members of the second battalion of the Royal
Canadian Regiment, were practicing advancing on an enemy position
that was protected by mortar fire.
   The shells were supposed to land well in front of the advancing
troops but landed in the middle of a group of soldiers, peppering
them with shrapnel.
   In January, eight soldiers at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier,
Quebec, were injured when an old artillery shell that was buried
underneath a campfire exploded.

<HEAD>Polish Bishops Urges Political, Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's influential Roman Catholic
bishops say Communist authorities will plunge Poland deeper into
poverty unless they allow the political freedoms necessary to make
promised economic reforms work.
   In their first statement since last month's labor unrest, the
bishops called for greater freedom of association and reinstatement
of the free trade unions the government denied citizens 6{ years
ago.
   The statement Monday came as the banned Solidarity independent
labor federation accused the government of dramatically inflating
the reported 56 percent turnout in nationwide regional and local
elections held Sunday.
   Since a nearly three-week strike wave that ended May 10, the
government has said it wants to accelerate its economic reform
program and may legalize certain independent associations.
   The bishops' communique, issued after a weekend conference in
the northeastern city of Bialystok, criticized the pace of the
government's program of political and economic reforms.
   ``Numerous announcements are not accompanied by equally
energetic actions,'' it says.
   The recent strikes stemmed mainly from economic causes: the
``impoverishing of society'' and the ``remarkable increase'' in the
cost of living for families, the communique says.
   Prices have risen by at least 40 percent so far this year.
   Opposition spokesmen say the government should recognize
Solidarity and begin negotiations with the opposition on solving
Poland's economic problems.
   ``The bishops share basic concern over the state of the country
and society's basic rights,'' they said in their statement.
   The church says more than 90 percent of Poland's 37 million
people are Roman Catholics.
   ``Critical judgment of the situation ... should lead to
courageous and far-sighted changes which are commonly believed
necessary in the economic, social and political spheres,'' the
bishops said.
   Referring to the authorities' announced plans to make it easier
to form private associations, the bishops said, ``This may
contribute to the rise of creative activity in the society.''
   But they said the changes must ``create freedom of associating
accessible for all,'' regardless of political viewpoint, and
eliminate administrative and political interference in associations.
   ``Even far-reaching changes in this field will not replace the
need of trade union pluralism, which, according to the social
teaching of the church, belongs to the basic rights of working
people,'' the statement adds.
   Trade union pluralism is one of the basic demands of Solidarity,
which has remained active though it was banned after a December
1981 military crackdown.
   About 50 Solidarity local organizations have sought registration
in the courts over the past year, but all have been denied it on
the grounds officially recognized unions already exist at the
plants.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said poor economic conditions
discouraged some people from attending Sunday's voting but argued
that the elections were a breakthrough because some candidates
actively campaigned for the first time and some races were
contested between people of different parties.

   Cleanup crews hauled away 300-pound
barrels of chlorine compounds and officials met to assess the
damage of a four-day fire that destroyed a chemical factory and
forced the evacuations of 25,000 people.
   Residents who fled their homes as poisonous yellow-green fumes
wafted over the state's third-largest city were allowed to return
Monday after firefighters neutralized leftover chemicals in the
Advanced Laboratories plant.
   About 275 people, including 22 firefighters, were treated for
respiratory problems and chlorine burns as explosions peppered the
century-old mill housing the factory.
   Mayor Richard Neal planned to meet today with Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy and state Department of Environmental Quality Engineering
Commissioner Daniel Greenbaum to determine what state aid is
available for this city of 150,000 residents.
   ``There's a hefty price to this four-day problem,'' Neal said.
   No damage estimate was available, but authorities have placed
the cost in the millions of dollars.
   Firefighters pumped 6,000 gallons of water per minute for 36
hours to flood the factory and quell hundreds of small explosions
that rattled the plant, which made chloride pellets used to
disinfect swimming pools, during a series of fires that began
Friday.
   The fire belched a chlorine cloud measuring 100 feet high, three
miles long and four city blocks wide at its peak. Flames soared 100
feet above the plant. The fumes scorched vegetation and were
smelled 15 miles away.
   After the explosions ceased Monday morning, crews poured in a
mixture of boric acid and sodium sulfate to turn the remaining
chlorine compounds into harmless salt.
   Only the street in front of the plant remained closed and police
patrols and fire trucks remained on the scene, Fire Commissioner
Darnell L. Williams said.
   ``The end of the plant where there were no chemicals is just
black with a foot of water and muck on the floor,'' said John
Higgins, regional director of the environment quality department.
   ``The predominant color on the other end, where the chemicals
were, is a rusty orange, from the oxidation of the barrel rings and
other metal that rusted in the chlorine atmosphere,'' he said.
``It's a huge mess.''
   Authorities said the first fire started when rain blew through
an open window and triggered a chemical reaction and fire in a
hopper of chlorine compounds.
   Richard Lincourt said he had been at one of several area
shelters since police woke him early Saturday morning.
   ``I'm going to be the first one out this door,'' Lincourt said
before boarding a school bus to return home.
   ``The door isn't wide enough because we're all going to be
going,'' another evacuee said.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today, and
share prices declined on the Tokyo Stock Exchange following an
overnight drop in New York.
   After opening at 126.39 yen, up 0.30 yen from Monday's close,
the dollar hit a high of 126.43 yen before closing at 126.33 yen.
It closed Monday at 126.09 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues slid 213.46 points, or 0.75 percent, to finish the
day at 27,925.57 points.
   ``The market is a bit mixed following the summit, trying to find
a trend,'' said King Ogino, a foreign exchange dealer with Goldman
Sachs. He was referring to a Toronto summit of seven leading
industrial nations, including the United States.
   ``Fear of U.S. inflation could depress the dollar and stock
markets,'' he said. ``The yen is still a safety currency, and
that's why people are hedging.''
   On the stock exchange, investors ``generally stayed on the
sidelines, although steel issues gained across the board,'' said
Hitomi Sakano of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
``Electronics, precision instruments, finances and real estates
fell back.''
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei's loss to a 20-point overnight
drop on Wall Street.
   The stock exchange suffered its first decline in six days on
Monday when the Nikkei average plummeted 203.43 points.
   ``Investors are not active so far this week following heated
trading last week,'' said a broker at a major securities firm,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said investors had found few new incentives and had engaged
in occasional profit-taking. ``That's pushing share prices down,''
he said.
   The index closed at a record high 28,342.46 points on Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of Al Hirschfeld's caricatures have come to
life to celebrate the artist's 85th birthday today.
   Celebrities from the art and theater worlds turned out Monday
night at the Margo Feiden Galleries in Greenwich Village, where
much of Hirschfeld's work is displayed, to honor the man who has
captured many of their likenesses.
   The artist, known for his caricatures of celebrities as diverse
as Humphrey Bogart, Superman and Albert Einstein, estimates
conservatively that he has sketched more than 3,000 drawings.
   Hirschfeld draws the caricatures in the studio of his East Side
town house, while sitting in an old barber chair in front of a
heavily scarred wooden drawing table.
   In an interview with The New York Times, where many of the
artist's caricatures are published, Hirschfeld said his career
began in the 1920's when a friend who happened to be a press agent
took a look at a caricature he had sketched on a program during a
theater performance.
   That sketch was sold to The Herald Tribune, which wanted another
one the following week. About a year later, the Times started
requesting sketches and Hirschfeld kept them coming over the years.
   Hirschfeld said drawing feeds his ``insatiable appetite for pure
line, for distillation, for bringing things down to the simplest
form.''
   ``What I do, across all the years of staring at a blank piece of
paper, is create a new problem every time, and then solve it to my
own satisfaction,'' he said.
   Hirschfeld's drawings all contain a game for the viewer. The
name of his daughter, Nina, appears in all the sketches and the
number of times the name appears is revealed next to the artist's
name.
   ``Nina was born on Oct. 20, 1945, and on that day I put in a
drawing, in a circus poster in the background, a little baby
reading a book called `Nina the Wonder Child,' '' he said. ``And
since then it has become a national insanity.''
   The Times article today played on the game, with a small ``6''
next to the byline indicating there were six ``Ninas'' in the text,
including one hidden in the first four paragraphs.

<TEXT>
   Six soldiers learning
explosives handling were killed and three injured at a Canadian
Forces base when enough plastic explosives to level a small house
detonated prematurely.
   The five men and a woman, all military engineering students,
were preparing to blast a five-yard-deep crater on Monday when the
more than 60 pounds of plastic explosives detonated, military
authorities said.
   Three other second-year officer training cadets were injured in
the blast, which occured on the third day of a four-day training
session.
   ``We do not know at this time what was the cause of the
explosion and that will be a matter for summary and formal
investigations over the next long period,'' said Lt. Col. Graham
Meharg, administrator of Canadian Forces Base Chilliwack.
   Further explosives training was suspended pending a military
investigation.
   The tragedy cast a pall over the 2,000-soldier base near this
city of 40,000 in a quiet farming valley about 60 miles east of
Vancouver.
   Some survivors were in shock and Meharg would not allow those
who were not to speak to reporters.
   The training unit, which was also learning to blow up concrete
and trees, consisted of 29 students, seven instructors and five
support staff.
   ``They were on their third day . . . (and) did know what they
were doing with explosives,'' said Meharg.

<HEAD>Professor Says Unsigned 1857 Story was Written by Charles Dickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A professor says he has determined that an
unsigned, untitled story was by Charles Dickens and shows the
author's penchant for interchanging personal details of his own
life with those of his characters.
   Professor Harry Stone of California State University at
Northridge made the find in Household Words, the weekly journal
edited by Dickens for nine years.
   Stone has named the 1857 work, ``The Bride's Chamber,'' The New
York Times reported today.
   The story is a self-contained segment of a tale in five
installments called ``The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices,'' the
Times said. Scholars knew the overall tale was a collaboration
between Dickens and Wilkie Collins, but until now, no one could say
which of the two wrote which segment, the Times said.
   The story reveals how Dickens fell in love with an 18-year-old
actress, Ellen Lawless Ternan, who remained the married author's
mistress until his death, Stone said. The character of the young
woman in the story also is named Ellen.
   Two other Dickens scholars _ professors Steven Marcus of
Columbia University and Richard Dunne, chairman of the English
department at the University of Washington in Seattle _ said
Stone's find could add to a more complete understanding of the
British master.
   ``I know Stone and his writings, and he is a very careful
researcher,'' Dunne said.
   Besides the connection created by the use of the name Ellen,
which Stone considered a key clue, the professor said he also
concluded that Dickens was the author by using letters from Dickens
along with other contemporary evidence. One piece of evidence was a
detailed ledger maintained by an editor of Dickens' journal telling
who wrote what in the publication, Stone said.
   When Dickens wrote the story, Stone said, the author was on the
verge of a great emotional crisis and considered the young actress
who entered his life at that time as a heroine.
   All the novels Dickens wrote after the story, including ``A Tale
of Two Cities'' and ``Great Expectations,'' contain ``a central
character made miserable and often destroyed by a consuming
passion,'' Stone said.
   `` `The Bride's Chamber' goes to the heart of Dickens himself,''
he said.

<HEAD>American Cattlemen, Citrus Producers Welcome Lift on Import
Restrictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas cattlemen and Florida citrus growers were
enthusiastic about Japan's decision to liberalize import
restrictions and double the amount of beef and oranges it buys from
the United States.
   ``It's going to be a morale booster for us and it's going to
help our markets some,'' Charles E. Ball, executive vice president
of the Texas Cattle Feeders Association in Amarillo, said Monday.
   ``This has been a psychological thing for our people: the fact
that we import so much from Japan while they've had barriers on our
beef and citrus over there,'' Ball said.
   The agreement, announced Monday in Tokyo by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter, calls on Japan to nearly double its
beef imports by 1991. It also provides for doubling of Japan's
imports of oranges from the United States.
   ``It's clearly beneficial ... a positive step forward for the
Florida industry,'' said Robert Behr, director of economic research
for the Florida Department of Citrus in Orlando, Fla.
   Japan is Florida's largest export market for fresh grapefruit,
and Florida growers hope the agreement will boost sales of other
citrus products.
   ``We have the potential for similar growth in orange and orange
juice that we have had with grapefruit,'' said Lee Bouldin,
international marketing director for the citrus department.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department said total American citrus sales
to Japan could increase from $50 million to $150 a million a year
when the quotas are lifted. The agreement could double U.S. exports
of beef and oranges to more than $1 billion annually, Yeutter said.
   Under the agreement, Japan will be allowed to set beef tariffs
of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to
allow Japanese farmers time to adjust.
   Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000
tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990.
   Some Texas cattlemen said they doubt that they'll see an
immediate financial gain as a result of the agreement.
   ``The import quota as I understand it was very small anyway, and
doubling something that was small to begin with is going to have a
pretty minor impact, but it's a step in the right direction,'' said
San Angelo rancher Skipper Duncan, who raises feeder cattle.
   In Japan, some farmers have reacted angrily to the agreement,
and one cattle farmer committed suicide to protest the
liberalization of the country's agricultural markets.
   Ikko Abe, 57, a farmer in Iwate prefecture of northern Japan,
died after hanging himself on Saturday, but details of his death
were not released until today, said a police official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said Abe left a note saying, ``I oppose the liberalization of
beef imports. I will protest it with my death.''
   Abe owned 50 head of cattle and 2.47 acres of rice paddies, the
official said. Iwate prefecture is the fourth largest producer of
beef in Japan.

   Summer got off to a scorching start today as a heat wave
blistered dozens of cities in the central and eastern United States.
   Summer officially began just before midnight Monday, following a
sweltering day of record-setting temperatures in nearly 40 cities.
   The mercury hit 110 degrees at Bullhead City and Phoenix, Ariz.,
Hill City, Kan., and Laughlin, Nev., setting a record high for the
date.
   A cold front brought some relief to parts of the north-central
United States with readings in the 50s and 60s over much of the
Great Lakes region and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   A few showers and thunderstorms lingered along the cold front,
while other storms were widely scattered through western portions
of the nation and east of the Mississippi River. The sky was clear
across the southern and central Plains and the lower and
mid-Mississippi Valley.
   A thunderstorm in Fernley, Nev., spawned a tornado that damaged
several roofs, ripped down power lines and uprooted several trees
Monday night.
   Today's forecast was for mostly sunny skies and hot temperatures
for much of the nation; showers and thunderstorms scattered from
the Gulf Coast region across the southern Atlantic coast states and
over the Rockies and the Great Basin; and a few severe
thunderstorms possible from eastern North Dakota through Minnesota
into Wisconsin.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 90s across much of the
nation; in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific coast; in the 80s over
the Rockies, the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the central Gulf
Coast and the south Atlantic coast states; reaching 100 to 110
degrees in the deserts Southwest; readings over 100 degrees from
the central Plains into northern Illinois.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Quillayute, Wash., to 93 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France has detonated another
nuclear weapon in the South Pacific as part of its series of
underground tests in the region, the foreign minister said today.
   The minister, Russell Marshall, condemned France's continued
testing of nuclear weapons in the region.
   Marshall, also minister for disarmament and arms control, was
responding to a report from New Zealand government scientists that
France had conducted a small underground nuclear test at Mururoa
Atoll on Friday.
   They said it was the third blast there this year and the 98th in
the series started in 1976, when France abandoned atmospheric
testing.
   New Zealand monitored the blast at Raratonga, in the Cook
Islands, about 1,800 miles northeast of its coast.
   The weapon carried an explosive yield of five kilotons, the
equivalent of 5,000 tons of dynamite, said government seismologist
Murray Lowry.
   ``This explosion is smaller than most, but even so weapons of
this size would cause enormous destruction. It is totally
reprehensible,'' Marshall said.
   He added, ``The fact that we detected this explosion is further
evidence that the means of verifying a ban on testing are at hand.''
   New Zealand has called for a comprehensive ban on such nuclear
tests.
   The nation joins its South Pacific neighbor, Australia, in
vigorously opposing French nuclear testing in the region.
   France refuses to comment on reports of its testing.

   About 25 homeless people gathered for a hot meal
at the opening of 458 Cafe, where patrons are asked for their order
instead of told to wait in a soup line.
   The cafe, housed in an art deco-style building, serves as a
full-service restaurant for the homeless. Volunteer waiters take
orders from seated patrons who are offered a choice of meals.
   The clientele Monday was not demanding _ many simply shrugged
when asked to choose from the menu of beef burgundy or
chicken-and-rice casserole, salad, green beans or corn, and
chocolate cheesecake or peaches.
   Oscar Shears can't remember the last time he sat down at a table

lingering over hot food and fresh coffee is an unaccustomed
pleasure.
   ``It's been awhile _ I ain't had no money,'' Shears said. He
still doesn't have any money, but he enjoyed a meal of beef
burgundy, corn and green beans with ham hocks.
   ``The atmosphere here is a whole lot different (from a soup
kitchen),'' said Shears, who lives in a shelter. ``It kind of makes
you feel like a person again.''
   Jim Zerdecki, who usually stays in shelters, agreed.
   ``When a lot of people go through a soup line they feel more
like animals being fed out of a trough,'' he said. ``This makes
people feel more like they're somebody, maybe somebody special.''
   The Rev. A.B. Short, who helped launch the 28-seat diner, said
he wants more from his concept than a few dozen filled stomachs.
   ``Food is not really what we're serving here,'' Short said.
``What we're serving is friendship, hospitality, brotherhood and
sisterhood.
   ``Something almost mystical happens when people sit down
together and share a meal,'' Short said. ``Walls break down.''
   Short conceived the idea for the restaurant two years ago after
a passing comment from Bobby Freeman, who chairs the Atlanta
Community Food Bank's board of directors.
   Short envisions a multipurpose stop for the homeless, including
legal services, weekly visits by a mobile medical clinic, and
alcohol and narcotics support groups.
   The building, a former drive-in liquor store, was purchased for
$60,000 with federal grants.
   The restaurant is operated by the Community of Hospitality, a
non-profit religious group that grew out of Short's activities. The
food is provided by the food bank.

<HEAD>Farmers Hanging On To Grain As Drought Drives Up Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought is driving up corn and
soybean prices, but some farmers are reluctant to sell their stored
grain despite the huge profits they could make.
   Soybean prices hit an 11-year high of $10 a bushel Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Every day without rain could translate into more profit for
farmers choosing to sit tight.
   Yet they are in a quandary: Should they sell now and hope for a
bountiful harvest that will replenish storage, or should they hang
on to what they have and risk losing money once it rains and prices
plummet?
   ``I think there's quite a few farmers just waiting for prices to
go higher. My father-in-law told me over the weekend that he sold
his beans a month ago and look what he could have gotten now,''
said Susan Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Farm Bureau.
   She also said she knows of a man who has enough soybeans to
cover this year's crop loss.
   ``He said it didn't matter if he got a crop this year, with the
way prices are going,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   ``I don't know when is a good time to unload storage. Everybody
is scared to death,'' said Kurt Lehman, who with his father, Dean,
farms near Alleman.
   ``If beans get up to $11, $12, $13 a bushel ... at that point
you start selling and take your chances whether you get a crop or
not,'' he said.
   ``If it starts raining, prices will drop and there's the
potential to lose profits. It's a nerve-racking game. You're
gambling on the weather,'' Lehman said. ``Right now I could get a
darn good profit if I wanted to sell.''
   Farmers are guaranteed a federal loan price for their corn and
soybeans. In previous years, when market prices were significantly
lower, many chose to take the federal payment and forfeit their
crop, said Jerry Perkins, spokesman for the Iowa Corn Growers
Association.
   ``If the government loan rate was higher than the cash price,
the government would hold the grain as collateral. The farmer takes
the government money, goes out and spends it and says, `OK
government, keep the grain,'' Perkins said.
   ``This year, though, cash prices are going high enough. So if
the cash price is above the loan rate, the farmer says, `OK
government, sell my corn, take my loan rate and interest out and
give me what's left over,'' he said.
   Dick Naeze, who farms 750 acres of corn and soybeans in
Humboldt, figures he would clear about $5 a bushel for his 4,000
bushels of soybeans he has stored on his farm.
   ``That would be very good,'' he said. ``But I'm hanging on to it
because it's going up 30 cents a day. Gee, why sell it?''

<HEAD>Pravda Attacks Stalin's Myth As Military Hero</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist Party newspaper has heaped more
criticism on the late dictator Josef Stalin, faulting him for
signing a friendship pact with Nazi Germany and hobbling the army
with purges just before World War II.
   Many articles in recent months have attacked Stalin for purging
those he called ``enemies of the people'' and for the violent way
he collectivized agriculture and forced the country to
industrialize.
   But his reputation as the leader who galvanized the Soviet
nation to resist the Nazi invaders and drive them out had been left
largely intact.
   On Monday, however, Pravda published a chapter of a new
biography by Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov that reassesses Stalin's
military wisdom.
   The full-page article appeared two days before the 47th
anniversary of the German invasion, which usually elicits solemn
articles about Soviet heroism. In the center of the page was a
photograph of Stalin, smiling and shaking hands with Joachim von
Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign minister, with a caption that said
``We call your attention to this.''
   ``In our opinion it was a major political lapse to sign the
treaty on friendship and the border between the U.S.S.R. and
Germany on Sept. 28, 1939,'' the article says. ``The line should
have been drawn at the signing of the non-aggression pact the month
before, which evidently was a forced step.''
   While the non-aggression pact shocked the non-fascist
governments of Europe, the subsequent treaty shook the foundations
of Communist ideology by declaring friendship between the Soviet
Union and the fascist Adolf Hitler.
   Volkogonov questioned how Stalin and his premier, Vyacheslav M.
Molotov, could forge a friendship with the Nazis. ``To practically
disavow all our own anti-fascist ideological positions _ that was
too much,'' the article said.
   Soviet historians have in the past portrayed the non-aggression
pact as necessary because the nation was too weak to confront
Germany and needed time to prepare. It is said to have bought time
for the Soviets to build the arms industry and seize territory,
particularly eastern Poland, as a buffer.
   History books have obscured the friendship treaty, tending to
lump it in with the non-agression pact.
   The article takes Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1927
until his death in 1953, to task for military blunders, calling him
a ``cocksure politician'' rather than military strategist. And it
describes the purges, which Western historians say deprived the Red
Army of its best officers.
   ``Senseless and bloody terror reached the limits which
threatened the existence of the very system on the eve of the
hardest trials,'' Volkogonov said. ``Two years before the war which
was coming to the borders of the motherland, the country was made
feeble.''
   He described Stalin as a man ``blinded by his own
stubbornness,'' unable to admit mistakes, and declared:
   ``If we innocently refer to foreign policy and strategic
blunders as Stalin's miscalculations, then in the realm of
personnel his actions were plainly criminal. The enormous scale of
the repressions were possible only because the leader created a
social inertia of violence, which begot denunciations, lack of
principles, slander and mass lies.''
   Media criticism of Stalin has increased in recent months,
particularly since a speech Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
delivered Nov. 2, 1987, to mark the 70th anniversary of the
Bolshevik revolution.
   Gorbachev criticized Stalin for repression and for executing
political rivals on false charges of treason, but said forced
programs of industrializing the country and collectivizing
agriculture were justified because the country needed to be
modernized.
   He did not mention figures, but Western historians say millions
of people died in the 1930s purges.

<HEAD>Day-Care Abuse Investigation Called Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation of allegations of sexual
abuse at a day-care center at the Army's Presidio base has been
closed due to a lack of evidence, officials announced.
   ``There is no reasonable likelihood that further investigative
effort would have developed evidence to support a criminal
prosecution,'' U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Monday.
   He said the 19-month federal probe of allegations that 60 or
more children were sexually abused at the Presidio Child
Development Center had ended despite his belief that children had
been molested there.
   Some children may have made up stories when talking with
investigators, he said, and others were too young to remember and
relate what happened. Still others, Russoniello said, could not
have testified because of their immaturity.
   Families have filed $53 million worth of claims on behalf of
themselves and their children in connection with the abuse
investigation, Presidio spokesman Bob Mahoney said.
   Jerome Garchik, an attorney for two of the families, predicted a
rash of lawsuits against the Army. He said the federal government
should set up a fund of up to $50 million to compensate the alleged
victims and their families.
   In February, a federal judge dismissed the final abuse charge
against a former worker at the center after the parents of a child
who allegedly was molested refused to participate in a trial.
   The employee once faced 11 molestation charges involving 10
children, but all but the final charge were dismissed due to lack
of evidence or vagueness.
   His indictment last October resulted in the examination of
nearly 100 children from the center for signs of physical or
psychological abuse.
   Allegations about the center surfaced in 1986, when a 3-year-old
boy who attended it told his parents he had been molested.

<HEAD>Fire Breaks Out A Block from Reagan's Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire swept early today through a building a block
from the hotel where President Reagan was staying for the economic
summit.
   The blaze in the vacant, six-story building prompted fears for
the safety of Reagan and other world leaders in nearby
accommodations awaiting the final-day sessions of the seven-nation
conference, said fire chief Walter Shanahan.
   But firefighters extinguished the blaze within an hour of the
initial alarm and no leaders were reported evacuated.
   Cinders showered the street in the city's financial district as
the blaze initially threatened to spread to nearby buildings. But a
wave of firefighters arrived and doused the flames, preventing
further damage.
   The fire marshal's office was called in to investigate because
of suspicions the blaze was deliberately set, said Shanahan.
   Sgt. Rick Morris, a spokesman for the summit security force,
said, ``It doesn't look like it's related (to the summit) at all.''
   Security around Reagan's hotel was tight, but Morris said there
were no plans to evacuate the president from the Royal York Hotel,
about 150 yards southwest of the fire. British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher remained inside the King Edward Hotel, about 150
yards northeast of the blaze.
   One fireman was taken to the hospital with a broken wrist, and
another was treated for a minor injury on the scene, said Shanahan.

<HEAD>Dollar Holds Steady In Calm Trading; Gold Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was holding steady in calm European
trading late this morning despite a small increase in short-term
West German interest rates earlier in the session.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the Deutsche Bundesbank's decision to raise the
rate on securities repurchase agreements to 3.5 percent from 3.25
percent had been expected and didn't have any immediate impact on
the currency market.
   Higher West German interest rates make West German investments
more attractive, which could depress demand for the dollar.
   ``The market is relatively tranquil,'' said one senior trader
with a foreign bank in Milan. ``Activity has essentially halted to
see whether there's going to be any reaction to the movements in
interest rates.''
   He added that the rate hike already had been discounted by the
market.
   The market also was in a ``wait-and-see mood'' over the Toronto
economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries.
   Although the summit, which ends today, wasn't expected to
produce any major developments for the currency markets, traders
were on their guard for any statements that could affect the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 126.33. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 126.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.7569 West German marks, up from 1.7543
   _ 1.4605 Swiss francs, up from 1.4580
   _ 5.9280 French francs, up from 5.9173
   _ 1.9767 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9730
   _ 1,304.50 Italian lire, up from 1,302.00
   _ 1.2065 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2094
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7867 to buy one pound, fractionally more expensive than $1.7865
on Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $451.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $453.90. At mid-morning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $451.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $451.80, down from $452.50 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.55 to close at a bid of
$452.75.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $7.19 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $7.26.

   Three men accused of killing a sheriff's
deputy during a jailbreak surrendered because they knew their
chances of survival were slim, said a sheriff who participated in
the three-state manhunt for them.
   Frank Bancroft, suspected of being the triggerman during a
weekend jailbreak that freed brothers Sonny and Frank Caston, gave
up without a fight after he was spotted Monday in a stolen boat,
said Dale Rinicker, sheriff of East Carroll Parish.
   Shortly after Bancroft surrendered, the Castons also gave up at
the East Carroll Parish sheriff's office, Rinicker said.
   ``They just didn't want to get shot or killed,'' he said. ``And
they knew that's what it was coming to.''
   Bancroft, 19, of West Carroll was booked on charges of
first-degree murder in the death of radio operator Jeff Gathings,
23. Gathings was on duty alone at the West Carroll sheriff's office
in Oak Grove when an intruder shot him with a 12-gauge shotgun
early Sunday.
   Sonny Caston, 20, and Frank Caston, 21, both from Lake
Providence, were freed by the killer. They also face first-degree
murder charges, Rinicker said.
   All three were being held without bond at Oak Grove, a northeast
Louisiana town.
   Bancroft had served time in the West Carroll jail on a theft
conviction and was released five days before the killing, said West
Carroll Sheriff Gary Bennett. The Castons were jailed on burglary
and arson charges and are suspected of planning the escape with
Bancroft before his release, Bennett said.
   Bancroft was captured after the owner of a boat stolen Sunday
night from its Lake Providence dock spotted the boat Monday and
approached it in another vessel, Rinicker said.
   Bancroft identified himself to the boat owner, said he was
wanted and that he was ready to give up, the sheriff said. When
Rinicker and other law enforcement officials arrived, Bancroft was
waiting, his hands in the air.

   The announcement came hours after Gaborone police announced that
a car bomb had exploded early today near the home of a building
contractor in the capital.
   The presidential statement said the bombing was ``yet another
South African attempt on the lives of innocent Botswana.''
   Police said the bomb exploded at 6 a.m. under a light truck
parked outside the house of Allison Seketso in a residential area.
The bomb destroyed the truck and damaged Seketso's house.
   Seketso and his family were at home but were not injured, police
said.
   It could not immediately be determined if Seketso was in any way
affiliated with the ANC.
   There was no immediate comment from South Africa, which in the
past has staged cross-border raids on Botswana and other
neighboring countries to attack suspected facilities of the African
National Congress, which seeks to overthrow South Africa's
white-led government.
   South African commandos have repeatedly conducted raids in
Gaborone against people they say are black nationalist guerrillas
using the Botswana capital as a staging post for sabotage attacks
in South Africa.
   South African soldiers killed three women and one man in March
when they raided a house and waged an hour-long gun battle on the
edge of the city.
   South Africans killed one person in a May, 1986, attack against
alleged hideouts of ANC guerrillas. Fifteen were killed in a June,
1985, South African raid.
   Botswana officials have often denied the presence of ANC
guerrillas, although the government is sympathetic to the ANC's
aims.
   The ANC seeks to end the apartheid system of race-segregation,
to install a one-man, one-vote political system and to establish
government controls over major economic sectors.

   Convicted rapist Lawrence Singleton hasn't
been seen at the Florida address he listed with state officials,
but neighbors say they will live in fear until he is found and sent
packing.
   ``I find it hard to believe that none of the police departments
can tell where he is. This is totally incredible,'' said Lester
Heitlinger, among 50 residents of the neighborhood who met at a
recreation center Monday night.
   Two weeks ago, Singleton listed his brother's home in the
residential Forest Hills neighborhood as his address to comply with
a state law on incoming felons, but he hasn't shown up there and
his brother refuses to say where he really lives.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead in a
ditch southeast of San Francisco in 1978.
   Singleton, a 60-year-old former merchant seaman who grew up in
Tampa, spent eight years of a 14-year sentence in a California
prison. After his release on probation, Singleton was chased from
town to town by Californians unwilling to allow him to live among
them. He finally completed a yearlong probation on the grounds of
San Quentin prison and is now a free man.
   Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Cal Henderson told residents
that Singleton registered with authorities upon his arrival in
Florida. He is not, however, required to notify officials every
time he moves within the state.
   ``We get 30 ex-convicts coming into the county every month, and
we can't keep up with all of them,'' Henderson said. ``We have too
many current violators to try and keep up with past offenders.''
   That didn't calm frustrated residents, many of whom suggested
violence as a means of forcing Singleton out of their neighborhood.
   One woman, who refused to give her name, proposed throwing rocks
at the address of his brother, Walter Singleton.
   ``Walter Singleton has not been convicted of anything,''
Henderson warned. ``He's locked in his house, and he's afraid to
leave.''

   Hundreds of radical students
marched at the border today to demand reunification of North and
South Korea and the withdrawal of American troops.
   About 350 students from Seoul's Konkuk University held their
peaceful protest in front of steel barriers and barbed wire that
block a bridge leading to the border with communist North Korea.
   ``Drive out Yankees who hinder unification!'' students shouted
as they marched near the bridge after a ceremony at which they
prayed for reunification of the peninsula.
   In Seoul, a survey indicated that anti-U.S. sentiment was
growing among South Koreans and went beyond radical student
protesters.
   According to the survey, 16 percent of 2,000 eligible voters
questioned said they dislike the United States, compared to 3
percent in 1984.
   As the students protested today, an American soldier guarded the
bridge, and about 20 South Korean policemen and soldiers in
plainclothes patrolled nearby.
   The bridge is the only civilian access linking the Koreas. U.S.
forces help control the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone
across from Imjingak and roads to the truce site of Panmunjom,
which straddles the border.
   The students demanded withdrawal of about 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact to help deter
North Korean attacks. The protesters contend the United States
enforces partition of the peninsula.
   They also denounced the blocking June 10 of a planned march to
the North Korean border. Fierce street clashes broke out that day
when riot police fired tear gas to block thousands of students
trying to march to Panmunjom for talks with North Korean students.
   During today's border rally, student leaders called for dialogue
with North Korean students to help form a unified Korean team for
the Summer Olympics, opening Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   In the poll, at least 37 percent of those surveyed said they
like the United States, down from 70 percent four years ago.
   To Heung-yul, a researcher at Hyundai Research Institute in
Seoul, released the survey in a seminar.
   The survey said anti-U.S. feelings were rapidly spreading,
partly in response to a steady anti-U.S. campaign by radical
students.
   He also attributed the growing anti-U.S. trend to Washington's
policies, including pressure to open the South Korean market wider,
especially to American products.
   Of 3,700 college students surveyed, the researcher reported that
85 percent held the United States responsible for partition of the
Korean Peninsula.
   The United States and the Soviet Union divided the peninsula in
1945 to end Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. The
communist nation was established in the North in 1948, and a
pro-Western republic was created in the South.
   North Korea invaded the South in 1950, starting the Korean War.

<HEAD>$33 Million Plan Approved To Rebuild Rocket Fuel Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of a rocket fuel plant that
exploded last month say they have reached agreement with rocket
producer Morton Thiokol Inc. and NASA to provide the required
financial support for building a new plant.
   Pacific Engineering and Production Co. said Monday it would seek
$33 million in bank financing to rebuild the plant on a site
farther from residents.
   Two people were killed and 326 injured in the May 4 explosion
that caused $73 million damage as it leveled the Pacific
Engineering plant and damaged dozens of other buildings for miles
around.
   Pacific Engineering President Fred Gibson Jr. reiterated in a
statement Monday that the company believed the blast was caused by
a natural gas line at the plant.
   Southwest Gas Corp. and Clark County fire officials, however,
have discounted natural gas as the cause.
   Fire officials have not issued their report on the blast, but
department sources have said the most likely cause was a spark that
set off the fuel. Union officials have alleged safety violations.
   Under the rebuilding plan, the bank loan would be repaid over
seven years with installments based on sales, profit and cash flow,
according to the company statement.
   The remainder after seven years will be paid by the government,
the statement said, but it did not specify the amount.
   The plan was agreed to by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and Morton Thiokol, which manufactures the solid
rocket fuel boosters that use the fuel component made by the plant,
the statement said.
   ``We have reviewed a large number of potential (plant) sites,
two of which are approximately 60 miles northeast of Las Vegas,''
Gibson said, but added that none had been selected.
   The plant is said to be vital to the nation's space program. It
and another Henderson plant, owned by Kerr-McGee Corp., are the
only two plants in the nation making ammonium perchlorate, which
provides the oxygen necessary to burn solid fuel in the booster
rockets.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said
after the blast that they had enough ammonium perchlorate left for
eight shuttle boosters, or four flights.
   The Kerr-McGee plant stopped producing the chemical after the
blast but resumed the production last week.
   Government agencies agreed earlier this month to allow Pacific
Engineering and Kerr-McGee to levy a surcharge to cover rebuilding
and expansion costs.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
today that all Israelis _ not just the army _ should defend
settlements in the occupied territories.
   Rabin, in an interview with The Assoiciated Press, also said he
was right to encourage civilians to open fire on Arabs armed with
gasoline bombs.
   The defense minister said he would explain his views to
President Reagan and American officials during his visit to
Washington next week. The date of his departure has not been
disclosed for security reasons.
   ``We have to try together, the military and the civilians, to
take all the measures (needed) to put down the violence,'' Rabin
said.
   The United States has repeatedly expressed concern over Israeli
tactics to quell 6{ months of Arab unrest in the occupied
territories.
   American officials have recently criticized Rabin's statements
encouraging civilians to carry weapons and use them for
self-defense and against Arabs armed with firebombs.
   ``Every civilian settlement is organized for self-defense,''
Rabin said. ``We have lived with terror since the new Zionist
movement started 100 years ago. We are in a prolonged war of
independence ... and everyone has to be aware, prepared, equipped.''
   He further indicated that an Israeli farmer who was bludgeoned
and stabbed to death Sunday night should have been carrying a
weapon.
   The body of 33-year-old Eli Cohen was found Monday.
   ``I am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would,''
Rabin said. ``I believe the whole results would be entirely
different. He would be alive today.''
   Rabin said the level of violence in the occupied territories had
been reduced but was still unacceptable.
   ``We are determined to meet violence by force,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Rabin said his recent meetings with Palestinians
in the territories were important to help restore calm.
   Rabin disclosed he had held four closed-door meetings with
Palestinians from the occupied territories over the last several
weeks and said 13 to 15 Arabs had attended those sessions. He
declined to reveal names, saying some of those who had met with him
had received death threats.
   He said he did not negotiate with the Palestinians. ``We just
exchanged views, sometimes conflicting views,'' he said.
   He said the Palestinians he met ``represent a wide variety of
opinions'' but he added ``none of them is formally a member of any
of the PLO organizations. With them, I would not have met.''
   Israel regards the Palestine Liberation Organization as a
terrorist group and has outlawed meetings between Israelis and PLO
members.

   Major theater owners have sued the city, saying
the city's efforts to save some theaters by designating them
landmarks may actually have the opposite effect and bring the
curtain down on Broadway.
   The Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, Jujamcyn
Theaters and the League of American Theaters and Producers filed
suit Monday in an attempt to overturn the landmark status of 22
theaters and a restrictive demolition procedure.
   The owners say their problems started in March 1982, when the
Helen Hayes and Morosco theaters were demolished to make room for
the Mariott Marquis Hotel. Two months later, the city instituted a
demolition permit procedure applicable only to Broadway theaters.

<HEAD>Radio Reports Iranian Timetable For Freeing Britons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British radio report said today that the Iranian
government is drawing up a schedule for the release by Christmas of
Britons held in Lebanon and Iran.
   Independent Radio News, quoting an unidentified Iranian source,
said two British prisoners in a Tehran jail would be released
first, followed by three hostages in Lebanon.
   The hostages to be freed include Anglican church envoy Terry
Waite, who will be freed last, after the U.S. presidential election
in November, the commercial British network said.
   The Foreign Office and Iranian Embassy declined comment.
   Four British parliamentarians arrived in Iran on Monday on a
private mission arranged by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
The group, which says its goal is to improve relations with Iran,
will return home Wednesday, said a church spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Under the timetable, the report said, British tourist Nicholas
Nicola, 23, arrested in September 1986 on charges of firing shots
at a checkpoint on the Iran-Pakistan border, would be the first to
be freed.
   Next out of Iran would be businessman Roger Cooper, 53, who has
been held since December 1985 on spy charges, the report said.
Neither has been tried.
   ``Later this year and subject to good relations, Tehran will
consider leaning on Iranian-backed gunmen in Beirut'' to free
British television journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian
Keenan, the report said. Keenan is from British-ruled Northern
Ireland but holds Irish nationality.
   ``The source said Terry Waite will be the last to be released
after the American presidential elections in November,'' the radio
said.
   Waite disappeared in January 1987 while visiting Beirut to
negotiate the release of Western hostages. Eighteen foreigners now
are missing in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held
hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Britain says it refuses to make deals to free the hostages in
Lebanon. But Runcie told reporters today in London that he arranged
the meetings in Iran because ``I feel it is our Christian
responsibility to keep talking.''
   The group consists of Cyril Townsend and Robert Hicks of the
governing Conservative Party, Tom Clarke of the Labor Party and
Lord Tordoff of the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   The radio said Iran was drawing up the timetable after reaching
agreement with Britain on June 10 to exchange compensation for
damaged diplomatic buildings.

   Orange County's first ``zero

drug dealers and buyers and the seizure of dozens of cars worth
more than $250,000, authorities said.
   Among the eight juveniles and 192 adults arrested in the weekend
sweep were a doctor making a marijuana purchase from his new sports
car and a 16-year-old girl buying cocaine and driving a luxury
foreign car purchased by her father, police Chief Clyde Cronkhite
said Monday.
   Officials said 36 cars were seized, some of them containing only
a small amount of drugs, under the ``zero tolerance'' program which
allows vehicles containing drugs to be confiscated.
   ``If you're going to go out and buy drugs, especially in Santa
Ana, you better bring bus fare,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said
at news conference.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested an Arab who drove a car
containing weapons and explosives aboard an Israeli-bound ferry,
the ship's owner said today.
   Ilias Trochidis said the explosives were found just before the
Paloma was due to leave Athens' port of Piraeus on Monday.
Trochidis said there were 400 passengers and 100 crew members on
the ferry.
   ``Port authority personnel and security men found the stuff
hidden in the car's wheel wells during a security check of around
200 cars in the hold,'' Trochidis said in a telephone interview
from Piraeus.
   ``The guy was asleep in his cabin when they were found. He said
he'd just bought the car and didn't know anything about the
explosives,'' he said.
   Piraeus police officials declined comment. Spokesmen at the
ministry of public order were not immediately available for comment.
   The Cypriot-registered vessel was headed for the southern Greek
island of Rhodes, then Limassol in Cyprus and the Israeli port of
Haifa.
   About 100 of the 400 passengers aboard the ferry were traveling
to Haifa, an official from Trochidis' company, Afroessa Lines, said.
   ``We had Israelis, a few Americans, quite a number of British,
some Greeks, Greek Cypriots and Scandinavians aboard,'' the
official said, requesting anonymity.
   Port authority officials, security personnel and Israeli
security officers routinely check passengers and vehicles leaving
from Piraeus for Israel.
   ``They took out explosives from the wheel wells and knocked a
hole in the underside of the car...I could see gun barrels,''
Trochidis said.
   The Paloma sailed for Rhodes on Monday night, four hours later
than scheduled, he said.
   It was the second terrorism-linked arrest in Greece this month.
On June 1, a Palestinian identified as Mohammed Rashid was picked
up at Athens Airport after a tip from the American Embassy.
   The United States has asked for Rashid's extradition for alleged
involvement in a 1982 bombing aboard Pan Am jumbo over Honolulu
that killed one person and injured 15.
   Rashid also is suspected of being connected with a 1986 blast
aboard a TWA jetliner over Greece killed four people.

<TEXT>
   Five children are in temporary foster care today
while police search for the woman who abandoned them in a hospital
emergency room, saying she'd pick them up later.
   The children, 9-year-old twin boys and girls age 5, 4 and 2, had
medical exams at Cook County Hospital before they were placed in
foster care Monday, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for the
Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
   The woman, identified as Brenda Shed, told the children ``that
she was going to find a place for them to live and would be back
for them Thursday,'' said police officer Joseph Tabor, who is
assigned to Cook County Hospital.
   Ms. Shed, her children and a friend were evicted Thursday from
their two-bedroom apartment because she was three months behind in
her rent, said building owner Kirk Toliver. He said the woman moved
into the building six months ago from the Cabrini Green public
housing project.
   Schneidman said a woman came in to the emergency room Monday
morning and spoke with either a security guard or a bystander.
   ``She said, `I'll pick these children up Thursday,' and then she
just walked off,'' he said.
   Schneidman said the woman left her name with someone at the
hospital and gave an address at Cabrini Green. Police investigators
found no one at the address, said Sgt. Al Davis.
   Schneidman said it was too early to say whether the department
would seek custody of the children.
   ``We'd seek permanent custody .... only as a last step,'' said
Schneidman. ``We don't want to get ahead of ourselves yet. ...
Maybe she just thought she'd found a unique baby-stting service.''

   A robbery suspect was shot and killed by police
while he grappled with a sobbing hostage in a busy downtown square
where hundreds of terrified shoppers scrambled for cover.
   A second man was being sought by police after the shooting
Monday afternoon, which followed a bank robbery and car chase.
   Police assistant director Pierre Sangollo said two men stole a
car from a hospital parking lot and robbed a bank while brandishing
a shotgun and a revolver.
   Police gave chase in a patrol car but lost the bandits when they
drove the wrong way up a one-way street, he said. The men abandoned
the getaway car and entered Phillips Square, the heart of a busy
shopping district, Sangollo said.
   As police flooded the area, one of the fugitives fled. The
other, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, grabbed a 40-year-old
woman and dragged her to a police car that had been abandoned by
two officers who were trying to approach the gunman.
   He was shot by police as he tried to force his hostage into the
cruiser, Sangollo said.
   The gunman, who was about 30 years old, was struck in the neck
by a bullet and fell dead to the street, Sangollo said.
   A pool of blood stained the street by the door of the cruiser,
which also had a tire flattened by a bullet. Sangollo said the
hostage was taken to hospital for treatment of an injury to her
right foot, which he said may have been caused by a police bullet.
   The two police officers who had abandoned their cruiser later
were treated for shock, he added.
   Tierney Culmar had just finished making a deposit in a bank near
the square when the hostage drama began to unfold.
   ``He put the gun to her head and he was running across the
street, but she kept falling down and lost her shoes,'' Ms. Culmar
said. ``He had her around the waist and was dragging her on her
knees.''
   Ms. Culmar said police flooded the area.
   ``They were everywhere, behind the statues, behind parked cars.
Everyone was yelling: `Let her go! Don't shoot!' The lady was just
screaming and sobbing. He was telling her to come on and get up.
Her legs were dragging on the ground,'' she said. ``There were a
lot of people like me ducking behind cars.''
   The Quebec provincial police were investigating the shooting, as
required by directives from the provincial Justice Department.
   None of the identities of those involved in the incident was
released by police.

<DATELINE>BADRAH, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian rebels claimed today they killed or
wounded 8,000 of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's soldiers in three
days of fighting. The rebels captured the border town of Mehran in
the battle.
   A spokesman for the Iraqi-based National Liberation Army told
The Associated Press in Cyprus that rebel forces were still engaged
in combat today around Mehran. He gave no details.
   Rebels admitted that at least 57 of their troops were killed and
120 were badly wounded in the fighting.
   The Mehran offensive was the rebels' biggest operation. The NLA
is the main Iranian dissident movement that seeks to topple
Khomeini's government.
   The Iranian casualties claimed by the rebels could not be
independently confirmed. Reporters saw more than 1,500 Iranian
prisoners brought to Badrah on Monday.
   Mehran is about six miles east of Badrah and 90 miles from the
Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
   The rebels said in a statement issued by their headquarters in
Baghdad that their forces routed 32 battalions of Iranian regulars
and Revolutionary Guards in their offensive.
   As the 22 brigades of rebels were apparently gradually
disengaging to pull back across the border into Iraq, rebel
commanders have said they did not plan to hold Mehran, whose
civilian population fled years ago.
   A rebel communique had estimated the Iranian strength around
Mehran at 16,000 government troops and Revolutionary Guards, up
from previous estimates of 14,000.
   The rebels did not say how many fighters it had committed to the
battle for Mehran, but its assault force involved an estimated
several thousand men and women.
   Mehran, which has changed hands several times in the nearly
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, lies a few hundred yards inside Iran.
   The biggest operation before this was Operation Shining Sun in
March, in which the rebels said 15 of its brigades routed the
Iranians' elite 77th Khorasan Division in southwest Iran, killing
or wounding 2,000 men and capturing 1,500.
   The rebels said their gunners shot down an Iranian air force
Cobra helicopter gunship Monday.
   Mehran itself was lightly held and resistance was minimal, but
fighting around positions in the foothills of the Kani Sakht
mountains to the north was reported fierce.
   The rebels began moving massive huge amounts of captured
military equipment back across the border to Badrah Monday.

   Government troops captured a
communist rebel leader and 40 other guerrillas and dismantled a
major base used by insurgents to launch raids on the main island of
Luzon, military officials said today.
   Gen. Renato de Villa, the army chief of staff, presented the
captured guerrilla leader at a news conference and identified him
as Francisco Pascual, 41, a member of the central committee of the
Communist Party of the Philippines. De Villa refused to identify
the others or say where they were being held.
   He told reporters that Pascual and 40 other rebels were arrested
in raids Monday night in the northern province of Pangasinan, about
110 miles northwest of Manila.
   De Villa called the capture of the base and the guerrillas a
``crippling blow'' to the 19-year-old communist insurgency.
   He said Pascual was in charge of party activities in the central
Luzon region north of Manila and was among rebel and government
officials who supervised a two-month cease-fire that ended in
February 1987.
   Peace talks between the rebels and the government of President
Corazon Aquino broke down in January 1987, and fighting resumed
immediately after the truce expired a few weeks later.
   Brig. Gen. Orlando Antonio, a regional commander who also
attended the news conference, said troops confiscated more than
2,000 sticks of dynamite in a separate sweep in Baguio City, a
mountain resort north of Pangasinan.
   Antonio said Pascual was arrested while on his way to a rebel
hideout in Dagupan, in Pangasinan. Antonio said soldiers seized
assorted documents, a computer and radio equipment powerful enough
to transmit messages to much of central and northern Luzon at the
base.
   ``What we captured in Dagupan was actually an underground house
of the military staff,'' said Pangasinan provincial commander Col.
Romeo Odi. ``In other words, they were orchestrating their
operations from that particular communications center... And so,
with that capture, we are able to paralyze their operations.''
   Officials said the rebels planned to use the explosives to blow
up bridges and other targets in Luzon's Cagayan Valley, a rebel
stronghold.
   Pascual's arrest brings to at least five the number of central
committee members captured by the military this year. Among those
were party general secretary Rafael Baylosis and Romulo Kintanar,
chief of the communist New People's Army.
   ``With the arrest of Mr. Francisco Pascual, the (rebel)
leadership as well as the entire organization is dealt another
crippling blow by the government,'' De Villa said.

   Chicago's ``yuppie tax'' on racquetball
and health club memberships violates the state constitution's
restriction on occupation taxes, the state Supreme Court has ruled.
   The city needs approval from the state legislature to impose its
4 percent levy on club membership fees, the court said Monday.
   ``The city has gone far beyond merely taxing particular
activities and has imposed a tax unique to those types of
commercial enterprises,'' Justice Joseph Cunningham wrote in the
opinion.
   The court also said that the tax could not be viewed as a valid
levy on amusements since the clubs offer a wide variety of
non-amusement activities such as nutrition instruction and diet
counseling.
   The decision reversed an appellate court ruling but affirmed a
circuit court decision in a case brought by a group of Chicago
health clubs.

   The volume of water flowing in streams and
rivers fell well below normal over half the nation during May, the
U.S. Geological Survey reported today.
   The low streamflows reflected the drought plaguing large areas
of the country.
   The Saline River at Rye, Ark., dropped to only 10 percent of
normal flow for the month, and there was only 15 percent of normal
water in the Tombigbe River at Coatopa, Ala.
   The survey reported streamflows of only 21 percent of normal in
the Peace River at Arcadia, Fla., and the Buffalo River near St.
Joe, Ark.
   The French Broad River at Asheville, N.C., at 40 percent of
normal, also set a record low flow for the month.
   The survey reported that the combined flow of the nation's three
largest rivers _ the Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Columbia _
averaged 617 billion gallons per day during the month, 37 percent
below normal and the second lowest combined flow in 60 years. These
three rivers drain about half of the contiguous 48 states.
   Regionally, streamflows were lowest in California in May at 42
percent below average for the month. Flows were down 40 percent in
the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah; 29 percent in the Pacific
Northwest and 18 percent in the Southeast.
   Turning to underground water supplies as measured in wells,
water levels fell in the Southeast and Southwest. New lows were
recorded in Memphis, Tenn., Montgomery, Ala., and Jackson, La.
   Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that the low
water flows across the nation are damaging to navigation, hydro
power, natural resources and recreation.
   In the southeastern part of the country, low water resulted in a
33 percent deficiency in power generation last week, said Bob Page,
assistant secretary of the army for civil works.
   He said that generation problems are also being experienced at
plants in the Pacific Northwest, but added that he does not
anticipate any power shortages because power is being obtained from
other areas.
   Page added that because of low water, 96 percent of the beaches
at corps-operated reservoirs are unusable.

   Six environmental organizations and a trade
association say the Environmental Protection Agency's ``Superfund''
toxic waste cleanup program ignores the intent of Congress.
   The groups told a House subcommittee Monday that EPA has ignored
1986 amendments intended to settle the question: How clean is clean?
   Those amendments directed EPA to use ``relevant and
appropriate'' pollution standards contained in other laws, such as
the Safe Drinking Water Act, in setting cleanup goals.
   But EPA uses confusing risk assessments that leave varying
amounts of contaminants in the ground, according to a report from
the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, a trade association, and the
Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, the Natural Resources
Defense Council, the National Wildlife Federation, the
Environmental Defense Fund and the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group.
   Much of the report echoed findings of a study by the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment last Friday that EPA
is ignoring another provision of the amendments, that it prefer
permanent remedies in cleanups over simply containing the waste in
the ground or moving it to a landfill that might need to be cleaned
up later.
   Different residual contamination doesn't necessarily mean
cleanups fail to protect health and the environment, said J.
Winston Porter, assistant EPA administrator in charge of Superfund,
in testimony before the investigations subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Different exposures and resources at risk might well justify
different cleanup levels, he said. Porter is in charge of three
dioxin cleanups, ``and I'll be using different action levels at all
three,'' he said.
   In its examples, the report cited lead at the Schmaltz Dump in
Harrison, Wis., and at Rose Township, Mich.
   ``We learn from the Schmaltz Dump, Wis., Record of Decision that
soil lead concentrations greater than 14 parts per million pose an
unacceptable lifetime risk from direct contact. The Rose Township,
Mich., site set a level for lead in soil that is five times higher
than at Schmaltz,'' and other sites permit an even higher
concentration, 100 ppm, the report said.
   The explanation: In Wisconsin, children under three are assumed
to eat one gram of dirt a day; in Michigan, children are assumed to
have no access to the site.
   Walter Kovalik, deputy director of the Superfund office, said
the agency was in the process of forcing its regional offices to
use common exposure assumptions.

   Anti-establishment vagabonds clashed
with police before dawn today as a crowd of 4,000 tried to reach
the ancient Stonehenge monument to celebrate the summer solstice.
   Police said about 70 people were arrested and 10 were injured
after the vagabonds pelted police with stones, bottles and other
debris in an attempt to break police lines around the site. The
injured included eight policemen and two hippies.
   The estimated 4,000 vagabonds were quickly driven back by the
1,000 riot police carrying shields and truncheons and later obeyed
police orders to move off an illegal camping site nearby.
   ``It seems to have quieted down,'' Inspector Stephen Chandler of
the police in Devizes, about 15 miles north of Stonehenge, said.
``The tents have started coming down, the shelters started coming
apart.''
   ``We're not expecting more problems,'' he said, adding that the
hippies were leaving the site in small groups.
   The arrests were made about one hour before 60 white-robed,
modern-day druid sun worshipers celebrated the summer solstice, the
longest day of the year, with a ritual sunrise ceremony at
Stonehenge at 4:47 a.m.
   The ceremony at the 4,000-year-old site culminated with the
blowing of ram's horn trumpets.
   The government-funded English Heritage, which manages the site,
said the vagabonds had earlier this week refused an offer of 1,100
tickets to attend the ceremony under escort.
   Stonehenge is a mysterious double circle of gigantic standing
stones set in Salisbury Plain about 80 miles southwest of London.
It is thought to have been a center for pre-Christian and
astronomical worship, since the sun rises over a certain stone.
   The vagabonds, sometimes referred to as ``hippies'' in Britain
because of their 1960s lifestyle, wander the countryside of
southwestern England in a ragtag convoy of vehicles.
   In the past, they have held loosely organized music festivals at
Stonehenge coinciding with the solstice, when the sun reaches its
greatest distance from the equator.
   The festivals, held since the early 1970s, have been banned
since 1985 because of complaints of drug-taking and property damage
in previous years.

<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 4 grafs with testimony from congressional hearing</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency today
proposed to add 229 sites to the ``Superfund'' priority list for
toxic waste cleanups and to drop 30.
   The action brings the priority list to 1,177 sites, of which 378
are still proposals and 799 have been formally designated for the
list.
   Eventually, the agency has said, the list could grow to about
2,500 sites.
   Fourteen of today's new sites are owned by other federal
agencies, 12 of them either related to nuclear weapons manufacture
or a military base. Last week, EPA announced agreement with the
Defense Department on penalties to be imposed if the department
fails to live up to cleanup agreements.
   The 30 sites being proposed for deletion have not been cleaned
up, but ``do not satisfy any of the criteria'' for listing, EPA
said. They will be cleaned up under other programs, the agency said.
   Three other sites were deleted from the list in April on the
grounds that all work had been completed or that they posed no
threat, EPA said.
   Designation for the ``National Priority List'' means the site is
eligible for 90 percent federal financing of the cleanup under
EPA's supervision, unless a federal agency owns it. Federal
agencies are responsible for cleaning up their sites using their
own money.
   Six environmental organizations and a trade association told a
House subcommittee Monday that the Superfund program has ignored
1986 congressional amendments directing the EPA to use ``relevant

   Israelis shot and wounded two Arab youths
today, including a 10-year-old boy who was shot by a civilian
firing at a stone-throwing mob in the West Bank, hospital officials
said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said all Israelis, not just the
army, must defend the occupied territories, and he said he was
right to encourage civilians to open fire on Arabs armed with
firebombs.
   Rabin also said that a Jewish farmer found stabbed and
bludgeoned to death Monday should have carried a weapon. Police
blamed Palestinian activists for the slaying.
   The army confirmed an Israeli civilian was stoned in Nablus, in
the West Bank. It said the man told the military that he fired in
the air to disperse the attackers. Army officials said they had no
reports of injuries as a result of the shooting.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said the boy was shot
in the leg.
   The second reported injury involved a 16-year-old Arab who was
shot in the shoulder during a clash with troops in the village of
Burka near Nablus, said officials at Al Ittihad.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted Burka
residents as saying the army clamped a curfew on the village and
rounded up all men over 16 at the local schoolyard.
   The army confirmed a Burka resident was injured in a clash with
troops, but it would not provide further details.
   ``We are in a prolonged war of independence ... and everyone has
to be aware, prepared, equipped,'' Rabin said today.
   He spoke a day after Eli Cohen, 33, was found dead in a field
near Moshav Shekev, a communal farm inside Israel and bordering the
West Bank.
   Cohen was the fourth Israeli to be killed during the Arab
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began Dec.
8. At least 210 Palestinians have died.
   Rabin, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was
``really sorry'' that Cohen ``did not have the weapon that we would
have hoped he would.''
   ``I believe the whole results would be entirely different. He
would be alive today,'' said Rabin, who has been criticized for
encouraging Israelis to carry weapons to defend themselves against
Arabs.
   Cohen left home Sunday evening to spray insecticide on his
vineyard and never returned, said farm spokeswoman Etti Elinsky.
His body was found nearby on Monday. Police said he was stabbed in
the back and beaten, apparently with an iron rod, and his head was
crushed.
   Twenty Arabs were detained, and security forces clamped curfews
on two nearby Arab villages.
   In a stormy meeting Monday night, commune members decided they
would no longer employ Arab laborers, the farm's security officer,
David Elinsky, told Israel radio.
   ``We decided that we will do the job ourselves, with the help of
volunteers, even though this will hurt us economically,'' Elinsky
said. He did not say how many Arabs work for the farm.
   Thousands of Arabs, many from the lands seized in the 1967
Middle East war, work in Israel's agricultural sector, which has
come to depend on the cheap source of labor.
   Earlier Monday, Elinsky had said farm residents were considering
retaliatory measures against their Arab neighbors, including
barring them from using roads leading into Israel.
   ``On second thought, we decided not to take the law into our
hands and to cooperate with the security forces,'' he said after
the meeting.
   But residents complained that the army has ignored requests to
set up patrols following acts of vandalism in the area blamed on
Arabs.
   Residents vented their anger on Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, head of
the West Bank military command, who some tried to prevent from
entering the farm.
   Mitzna told the farmers: ``The war here is a lot more complicted
and difficult ... (but) it's likely that this was a terrorist
attack and we will do everything we can.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the slaying a ``serious
incident.'' He said if it indeed was carried out by Palestinian
militants, Israel would respond harshly.

   Prosecutors say they will push for the death
penalty again for a man convicted for a second time in the deaths
of two police officers.
   ``Let's go for it, all the way,'' said Patricia Fahey, the wife
of officer William Fahey, who was shot to death with his partner,
Richard O'Brien, during a traffic stop in 1982.
   A sentencing hearing begins today for Andrew Wilson, who was
convicted by a Circuit Court jury on Monday. Wilson's 1983
conviction in the case was overturned last year by the Illinois
Supreme Court, which ruled that a confession has been beaten out of
him.
   Wilson's brother, Jackie, was also convicted in the officers'
slaying but his conviction and life prison term also were
overturned because he didn't receive a separate trial. He is
awaiting a retrial.
   Prosecution witness Derrick Martin testified in both trials that
the Wilson brothers let him out of a car two blocks from the
shooting scene just before the officers were shot.
   During the second trial, however, Justice R. Eugene Pincham of
the Illinois Appellate Court testified that Martin had told him he
lied at the first trial.
   Martin also said Andrew Wilson told him he wanted to get some
police uniforms to help a friend escape from jail. Martin said
Wilson told him a few days later that he had killed the officers.
   The defense insisted Wilson was not in the car, even though his
eyeglasses were found at the scene.

   The government imposed a curfew in the
capital today after at least six people were killed in street
battles between thousands of protesters and riot police.
   Government radio said in a nighttime broadcast that the
restrictions began immediately and would last until August 19. The
curfew runs from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   Witnesses said thousands of students and other protesters fought
stone-throwing duels with police after authorities closed a Rangoon
university where students had staged peaceful anti-government
rallies.
   ``Five police personnel were killed, and 26 others seriously
wounded as a result of an attack by unruly mob armed with swords,
sticks and catapults,'' the broadcast said. ``A member of the mob
also was killed and several others wounded.''
   ``Since these violent acts disrupt public tranquility and cause
public disorder, the Rangoon Division Peoples Council deemed it
necessary to impose a curfew and ban public meetings and
demonstrations within the Rangoon municipal area,'' it said.
   The broadcast said the mob set fire to one police station and
the family quarters of another station. They damaged
government-owned buildings and traffic light posts, it said.
   The government Monday announced that classes at Rangoon Arts and
Science University, its affiliate colleges and the Institute of
Economics were to be suspended after an upsurge of student protests
against the 25-year-old rule of Burmese military dictato~n.
   Another government radio broadcast today announced the
suspension of classes, effective Wednesday, of two more
institutions where students have staged peaceful anti-government
rallies _ the Institute of Medicine and the Institute of Dental
Science.
   Witnesses said today's fighting began when about 1,000 students
of the arts and science university marched from campus toward
downtown Rangoon. High school students joined them.
   About 200 riot police swung batons and hurled stones to stop the
marchers about two miles south of the campus, witnesses said.
   They said the demonstrators, who had grown to 5,000 strong,
hurled stones and other objects and forced police to retreat a
block south to a military barricade.
   The protesters then dispersed in small groups.
   In the nearby Sanchaung area of the city, there were sporadic
clashes between protesters and police, who reportedly used tear gas
and firearms. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties
in those clashes.
   Throughout last week, students held anti-government rallies at
the university and put up posters that demanded the legalization of
student unions and the release of students who had been detained in
earlier protests.
   Several days of student unrest at Rangoon universities climaxed
on March 18 with anti-government riots that police and military
units rapidly crushed.
   According to diplomatic sources in Bangkok, Thailand, as many as
100 people may have died in the March 18 violence. The government
said two students were shot by riot police.

<HEAD>Jury Picks Neo-Classical Design For Library</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A romantic, neoclassical design has been selected
for a new $140 million central library building in a departure from
the steel-and-glass box architecture that marks the city's skyline.
   The new library, which will be the largest municipal library in
the United States, will be named after Mayor Harold Washington, who
died last year.
   Officials on Monday announced a jury's selection of a design
submitted by the Sebus group, one of five teams of architects,
developers and builders. The project has been debated since 1976.
   The city's Library Board was expected to give its endorsement
today. The new library will cost $140 million and is scheduled for
completion in 1991.
   ``The majority felt it was the one most consistent with the
architecture in the area,'' said Norman Ross, the jury's chairman.
``It feels like a library to many people, and it relates to the
surrounding great architecture.''
   The building's classical design reflects such historic Loop
landmarks as the Art Institute and the Auditorium Building.
   The plans call for a 10-story building with a pink granite and
brick facade, multistory arched windows, an array of skylights and
a large lobby. It will include a 400-seat auditorium and skylit
gardens.
   Most of the central library's 2.3 million-book collection has
been stored in a warehouse since 1974, when it was moved from a
central library building built in 1897. The building built in 1897
replaced a library destroyed in the great Chicago fire of 1871, but
the replacement was deemed inadequate within two decades.

   Japanese police have detained a Soviet couple and
their child after the family was refused asylum by the U.S. Embassy
in Tokyo, news reports said today.
   According to the reports, a Soviet photographer, his wife and
their son requested asylum at the U.S. Embassy after entering Japan
on tourist visas in early June.
   Officials at the embassy would not confirm or deny the reports,
saying it was up to the host country _ Japan _ to grant asylum.
   The Kyodo News Service reported that the U.S. Embassy turned
down the family's request because the three are Soviet citizens who
apparently were not fleeing political persecution.
   Kyodo said the couple was in their 30s and would be permitted to
remain in Japan ``for the time being.''
   A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that the Soviet family was seeking asylum but
refused to elaborate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost half of American school children have
never experienced a single tooth cavity and the rest are showing a
significant decline in dental decay, according to a study released
today by the National Institute of Dental Research.
   The study, which involved dental examinations of about 40,000
school children aged 5 to 17 coast-to-coast, showed that 49.9
percent had teeth with absolutely no decay.
   And among the others, institute officials said, decayed tooth
surfaces had declined by 35 to 36 percent.
   Dr. James P. Carlos, chief of the institute's epidemiology
branch in suburban Bethesda, Md., said that decay between the
teeth, which is the most difficult to treat, ``has practically been
eradicated.''
   Speaking of tooth decay, Carlos said, ``This disease, which once
was probably the most chronic disease of childhood, is being
decreased very fast.
   ``It is declining 35 to 36 percent every seven years and now
half of the children in the country have never even experienced
dental decay,'' he said.
   Carlos attributed the decline in tooth decay to the increasingly
widespread use of fluoride in the nation's water supply, in
toothpaste and in mouthwash.
   He said that American children are also receiving a high level
of dental care as evidenced by the survey findings that more than
82 percent of the tooth surfaces that have decayed had been filled
when examined for the study.
   He also said that only 4.3 percent of the children showed
missing teeth, indicating that ``more and more children are keeping
their teeth.''
   Carlos said that he expects the trend to continue, although a
complete eradication of decay is probably not possible.
   ``As successive groups of children move through, they seem to
have less and less decay,'' said Carlos.

<TEXT>
   The first full day of summer today promised the same hot and dry
weather that has buckled highways, sent people without air
conditioners to public shelters and added to the woes of
drought-plagued farmers.
   High temperatures today will be in the 90s across most of the
nation, the National Weather Service said. Temperatures didn't have
far to go on the Plains, with the overnight low at a warm 77 at
Bismarck, N.D.
   Nearly 40 cities in the central and eastern United States set
temperature records Monday as the early-season heat continued to
intensify, according to the weather service.
   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees across much of the
northern and central Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and the
desert Southwest. Highs in the 90s were common elsewhere across the
nation except for coastal and mountain areas.
   Authorities in several areas opened up shelters Monday to
residents without air conditioners. In Chicago, where it reached
104, city officials invited the public to use the city's libraries
and other air-conditoned municipal buildings during daytime hours
to escape the heat. The Chicago temperature reading tied the record
for the month of June.
   Customers of Chicago's Commonwealth Edison Co. set a single-day
record for electricity usage, said spokesman John Hogan, while
Consumers Power Co. in Michican set a usage record for the month.
   The heat caused discomfort for people with breathing
difficulties and heart conditions and prompted authorities in the
Chicago area and in Wisconsin to post ozone advisories, cautioning
people with those conditions to remain in air-conditioned rooms.
   The heat also proved dangerous to animals. Forecasters said the
livestock weather safety index entered the emergency zone in
several parts of Midwest and Plains. Farmers were advised to keep
animals in shade and provide plenty of water.
   ``Animals react to the heat in the same way humans do,'' said
Michigan Department of Agriculture specialist Edwin Renkie. ``It
does affect the animals and in some cases can kill them.''
   Heat distorted railroad tracks in Mobridge, S.D., last weekend,
causing five cars of a Burlington Northern train loaded with corn
to derail, said spokesman Al Wiegold in St. Paul, Minn.
   During the weekend, the heat in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area also
caused 25 roads to buckle, about the usual damage for the entire
summer, said Delmer Van Ekern of the state Transportation
Department.
   In Des Moines, searing heat buckled pavement Sunday, slowing
traffic on U.S. 6 and Interstate 235. On Monday, Des Moines' high
reached 101, breaking the 98-degree reading set for the date in
1933.
   Also Monday, Concordia, Kan., reached 106, breaking the
103-degree record of 1952; Sheridan, Wyo., went to 102 degrees,
topping the 100-degree mark of 1940; Madison, Wis., recorded 101
degrees, topping the record for the date of 97 also set during the
1933 Dust Bowl drought.
   Temperature records also were broken in Michigan, Montana,
Vermont, Ohio, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Nebraska,
Minnesota and Illinois, the weather service said.
   Agricultural experts said the heat is adding to the problems of
the drought in the Midwest and the Plains by evaporating what
little moisture remains in the soil.
   ``These real hot days _ 95 to 100 degrees _ are using more
moisture than we can stand to lose,'' said Harold Hunzicker,
agricultural adviser in Marion County in southern Illinois. ``We're
still hanging in there, but that is not to say we couldn't have a
disaster.''
   Tom Vigil, a heavy equipment operator in Denver who spends eight
to 12 hours a day laying drainage pipe, had this advice for staying
cool: ``Think about Santa Claus.''

<HEAD>Speed Drought Aid to `Brown and Brittle' Lands, Urges Ag Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

   Congress should speed aid to farmers hard hit
by drought that has caused $1.8 billion in crop damage and left ``a
brown and brittle land'' in its path, the Senate Agriculture
Committee chairman said today.
   ``You've got to be giving some help to these people, to say hang
on,'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., told a news conference. ``...
At what point do they sit around the kitchen table and start to
say, `I can't take it anymore.' I don't want that to happen.''
   Leahy, who headed a three-state tour of drought-stricken wheat
lands over the weekend, said the bipartisan task force of lawmakers
and administration officials that has been monitoring the drought
should sit down on Wednesday and come up with a blueprint for aid
to farmers.
   He said he had some thoughts about what the package should
contain but added that all of the task force members should have
their say before any type of drought relief legislation is unveiled.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told lawmakers last week
that they should be ready to produce legislation but not make
anything final until after the full extent of the problem is
understood.
   Leahy said it was not too soon to start shaping an aid package.
He said the drought has not only caused $1.8 billion in crop
damage. On their foray to Montana and both Dakotas over the
weekend, he said, the lawmakers found that the blazing sun and
shortage of rainfall had left ``a moonscape'' and a ``brown and
brittle land.''
   ``What I saw was not a disaster in the making,'' Leahy said.
``What I saw was a disaster now.''
   Even if the task force reaches a consensus this week on the
shape of an aid package, it would most likely take weeks or longer
to get the bill to President Reagan's desk. Thus far, urban
lawmakers who are persistent critics of agricultural subsidies have
held their fire amid the outcry from the Farm Belt for drought aid.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee balked on Monday at a
proposal to guarantee 92 percent of federal income-support payments
to wheat, feed grains, upland cotton and rice producers whose crops
are wiped out by the drought.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., proposed the measure, saying the
situation in his home state already was grim. But other panel
members said it was still too early to act and that his proposal
would have provided no aid to producers of crops not covered by
USDA programs.
   In the end, the panel did not vote on the proposal and instead
voted to attach a ``sense of Congress'' resolution calling for
drought aid in a $47.3 billion agriculture appropriation bill for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

   A truck hit the back of a chartered bus
carrying members of a Michigan drum and bugle corps early today and
36 people were injured, none critically, authorities said.
   The bus had stopped for mechanical problems and was struck when
it pulled back onto the roadway, said state police Cpl. Ron
Johnston. Fog may have contributed to the accident, he said.
   The bus was one of three returning about 60 members of the
Aurora Drum and Bugle Corps to Saginaw, Mich., from a Monday night
competition in Mishawaka. The members range in age from 14 to 21.
   Steve Stigall, a corps instructor riding on another bus, said
most of the youths were asleep when the accident occurred.
   ``All they can remember is something hitting them in the rear
and being thrown forward,'' said Stigall, of Somerset, Ky.
   Six rows of seats at the rear of the bus were crushed by the
impact, said instructor Joe Kuerzi of Louisville, Ky.
   The injured were treated at hospitals in LaGrange and Steuben
counties in northern Indiana and in Sturgis, Mich.
   Police dispatcher Cindy Culp identified the truck driver as
Larry Noble, 40, of Clinton, Iowa. His condition was not available.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs lede to insert ``and'' in first series. Also inserts 1

actually want in a man. Picks up in 9th graf, `The poll ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average American man is 5-foot-10, 172
pounds, with a lean build. He wants to be an inch taller, a pound
lighter and more muscular, and thinks a great deal about the body
shape of the average American woman.
   The average American man thinks women want a man who's 6 feet,
173 pounds and muscular. In fact, they want men the way men want
themselves: 5-11, 171, muscular. Men think women like them to have
hairy chests, and they're right.
   So says the Gallup Organization's ``national body image
survey,'' which was commissioned by, and described in, American
Health magazine.
   Now, as for the average American woman:
   The average American woman wears a size 10 to 12 dress, stands
5-foot-3{ and weighs 134 pounds. She has a soft body tone, short,
straight, brown hair, and imperfect, untanned skin.
   The average American woman wants to wear a dress two-to-four
sizes smaller, stand an inch taller and weigh 11 pounds less. She
would like more muscles, wavy or curly brown hair and smooth,
tanned skin.
   The average American woman thinks men want a woman who wears a
size 8 dress, stands 5-foot-4 and weighs 118 pounds. She thinks
they want a woman with a thin, soft body, long, wavy, blond hair
and tanned, smooth skin.
   The average American man doesn't think much about dress sizes,
but apparently speculates a great deal about the body shape of the
average American woman. He wants one with a full rear-end,
medium-width hips, a small-to-medium waist and medium-sized
breasts. He wants an average body type (not thin), soft body tone
(not muscular), long wavy hair and smooth, tanned skin.
   The average American woman wants a man to have medium to broad
shoulders and a medium to broad chest. In addition, he should have
brown or blue eyes, short, curly dark hair and be tanned and
clean-shaven.
   The poll also found the American woman's zest for thinness is on
the wane. Only 35 percent of women say they'd like a thin body;
about half are satisfied to be of ``average'' weight.
   But Gallup found women still are more weight conscious than men:
while they would like to lose about 10 pounds each, men on balance
are satisfied with their weight.
   The Gallup Organization said Monday it used a representative
national cross-section of 1,037 adults who were interviewed in
person.
   Among the survey's other conclusions:
   _Richer women are lighter and thinner than poorer ones, but rich
men have the biggest waistlines and the broadest shoulders and
chests.
   _Almost two-thirds of college educated women want a more
muscular, ``hard-bodied'' look, compared with 27 percent of those
without a college degree.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Blames Indian Government For Delay In Bhopal Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEEMA SIROHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American representative of Union
Carbide Corp. today accused the Indian government of delaying a
settlement in the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster and said the company
would begin settling with individuals.
   ``We are frustrated because of the attitude of the government.
The political will is not there to settle the case,'' said the
representative, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They talk about settling the case out of court but do not have
the authority from the top to do so,'' he said. ``We will settle
with individuals. They all have their own lawyers.''
   About 523,000 people have filed claims in the Bhopal District
Court. Union Carbide lawyers say the government attorneys have not
yet certified if the claims are true.
   Nearly 3,000 people died and 20,000 were seriously injured when
methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide subsidiary's
plant in Bhopal in December 1984. It was the world's worst
industrial disaster.
   The Indian government filed a $3 billion compensation suit
against the Danbury, Conn.-based multinational but the case still
is at the pre-trial stage.
   The Indian government also passed a law making it the sole legal
representative of the victims.
   When asked if the settlement with the victims would be legal in
view of the law, the Union Carbide source said: ``The case can be
settled in the United States. There is no law to prevent that.''
   However, H.K. Khan, secretary of India's Chemicals and
Petrochemicals Ministry, said Union Carbide could not settle
directly with the victims.
   The government last week requested the Bhopal court to issue an
injunction blocking Union Carbide from such a move.
   Judge M.W. Deo is to rule on the application July 29.
   Khan said the Indian government ``had to go back to court
because there was no proper offer forthcoming from Carbide'' for an
out-of-court settlement.
   He refused to discuss figures.
   Sources close to Union Carbide said in November 1987 that the
company was willing to pay $650 million in an out-of-court
settlement but the Indian government was pressing for more.

   A television evangelist reportedly
associated with the Rev. Jerry Falwell resigned as he tearfully
told his congregation of a liaison with a woman who was not his
wife.
   The lapse lasted for 10 months and occurred seven years ago, the
Rev. Marvin Rickard told church members of the Los Gatos Christian
Church. Rickard, 57, and his wife, Joyce, both spoke at three
services Sunday.
   Many churchgoers broke into tears when they heard the news from
their spiritual leader, described in a newspaper report as ``a
close ally of the Rev. Jerry Falwell.''
   Rickard built his congregation from 83 people in 1959 to an
estimated current membership of 6,500, with a claimed television
ministry of 100,000.
   Charles Ferrell, chairman of the fundamentalist church's board,
said Rickard's resignation will probably take him out of the pulpit
but not out of the church. Final decisions on Rickard's future will
be made by the board, he said.

   Two ex-convicts shot and killed five bank clerks
in northern China and made off with the equivalent of more than
$40,000, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday.
   One of the robbers later was killed by police, and the other was
captured following the theft early Monday, the dispatch said.
   The report did not identify them.
   Xinhua said the two men broke into a branch of the Construction
Bank of China at Shizuishan, in northern Ninxia province, at
midnight.
   They shot dead five bank clerks who were living in the bank
building and stole 160,000 yuan (about $43,243) in cash and state
bonds. Workers in China often are housed in or near their workplace.
   The two men were confronted by police while buying tickets at
the railway station. Police shot one man while the other escaped
with the money. He was captured a few hours later, Xinhua said.
   Armed bank robberies are unusual in China, where possession of
firearms is illegal.

   Three bronze statues of former
President-for-Life Habib Bourguiba have been removed, and
authorities are planning to dismantle others, it was reported
Tuesday.
   An equestrian statue of Bourguiba was removed under cover of
darkness in Tunisia's religious capital, Kairouan, last week.
   The move followed City Council's decision to rename the main
street that had been named for Bourguiba, the newspaper Tunis-Hebdo
reported.
   In the city of Gabes, 225 miles south of the capital of Tunis,
municipal authorities decided to remove two statues of Bourguiba,
the paper said. A statue of Bourguiba dominates the main street of
Tunis, still named for him.
   Many Tunisian cities have either a statue or street in honor of
the ousted leader. The newspaper Al Sabah reported that all these
reminders of Bourguiba's virtual dictatorship for 30 years would
soon disappear.
   He was ousted in November by his interior minister, Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, after a panel of physicians pronounced Bourguiba
senile and medically unfit to carry out his duties as president.
   Bourguiba, 84, lives in a chateau 20 miles south of Tunis and is
accorded ``all the respect due to a former chief of state,''
officials said.

<TEXT>
   Italy's Communist Party, the largest in the West,
chose a new leader on Tuesday to try to halt its erosion at the
polls.
   Achille Occhetto, the No. 2 in the party, was voted its
secretary in balloting by the Central Committee and the Central
Control Commission. The vote was 278-3, with five abstentions.
Occhetto was the only candidate.
   He succeeds Alessandro Natta, who suffered a heart attack in
April and has been under increasing criticism for the party's
electoral slide. Natta, 70, resigned June 13.
   In a speech Monday night to members of his party _ Italy's
second-largest _ Occhetto, 52, defended Natta's leadership but
called for greater openness and a firmer line against the
government, led by Christian Democrat Premier Ciriaco De Mita.
   The party says it has 1.2 million members, double that claimed
by its French counterpart, the second-largest Communist Party in
the West.
   The Italian Communists have been excluded from government since
1947. But they were at the threshold of power in the mid-1970s when
led by Enrico Berlinguer, who declared the party's independence
from Moscow. In 1976, the party captured 34.4 percent of the vote.
   Natta, who took over after Berlinguer's death in 1984, pledged
to follow his policies but lacked his political charisma.
   The party entered a period of drift and in 1987 suffered its
worst election defeat in 20 years, slipping to 26.6 percent of the
vote for the Chamber of Deputies in Parliament. Last month, the
Communists won only 21.9 percent of the vote in local elections.
   Occhetto on Monday noted that the party's traditional base of
support had shrunk and pledged to ``work for a new Communist
Party.''
   The Communist leader, heavy-set with a graying walrus mustache,
was born in the northern city of Turin. He joined the Communist
youth federation in 1953, won election to Parliament in 1976 and
has been re-elected three times. He was made party vice-secretary
after the disastrous 1987 elections.
   The Rome newspaper Il Messagero said Occhetto has ``a bit of a
`yuppie' ... image,'' noting his interest in sailing and gourmet
cooking.

   A bookstore owner, charged with kidnapping a
bank manager's wife who was found dead, was acquitted in the 1971
slaying of an Ohio man, investigators said.
   David C. Copenhefer, 41, was charged Monday with abducting Sally
Weiner at the shopping plaza where he operates Corry Books & Cards.
   Mrs. Weiner, 37, disappeared Friday and her body was found
Sunday on a farm near this northwestern Pennsylvania town. She had
been shot in the head.
   Her husband, Harry, had attempted to pay a ransom after his wife
called him Friday afternoon and directed him to a ransom note in
the bank's parking lot.
   No charges have been filed in Mrs. Weiner's death. Authorities
said their investigation was continuing.
   In August 1971, Copenhefer was acquitted in the shooting death
of a former seminary student in Kettering, Ohio, a Dayton suburb.
John L. Calkins' body was found three days after he was insured for
$550,000 in accidental death policies paid for by Copenhefer, who
was listed as a beneficiary on all but one policy.
   Investigators said Calkins and Copenhefer had planned to form a
computer firm with a third person.
   Police declined to say what led them to Copenhefer. Police and
FBI agents were seen confiscating armloads of guns, including
high-powered automatic rifles, from Copenhefer's Corry home and a
personal computer, desktop printer and computer printouts from his
business.
   Copenhefer is being held in Erie County jail on $100,000 bond on
charges of kidnapping, attempted robbery and attempted extortion.

<TEXT>
   Security forces arrested two white
South African soldiers after a shootout in which South African
commandos injured three Botswanan policemen, the president's office
said today.
   The statement said the shooting occurred late Monday when six
unarmed police officers were fired at by five South African
commandos who were planning a raid on a target in Gaborone, the
capital.
   South African commandos have staged numerous cross-border raids
in the past on Botswana and other neighboring countries to attack
suspected hideouts and bases of the African National Congress. The
ANC is the main guerrilla movement fighting South Africa's
government.
   The commandos escaped, but police said two South African
soldiers were later arrested at an army roadblock and were being
questioned. Authorities said the soldiers were driving away from
the scene of the shootout. They identified the soldiers as Corp.
Johannes Basson, 25, and national serviceman Theodore Hermanhen,
both of Johannesburg.
   It wasn't clear if the escaped commandos also were soldiers.
   The announcement came hours after Gaborone police announced that
a car bomb had exploded early today near the home of a building
contractor in the capital.
   The presidential statement said the bombing was ``yet another
South African attempt on the lives of innocent Batswana.''
   The South African military said Botswana's allegations were
being investigated ``to establish the facts'' before any other
public comment was made.
   The statement issued by President Quett Masire's office said the
shootout occurred at 10:30 p.m. Monday when the six-man police
patrol was surprised by five South African commandos about four
miles south of Gaborone.
   These commandos _ three whites and two blacks _ fled in a stolen
Botswana police vehicle which was found abandoned at the South
African border, the statement said.
   The bomb went off at 6 a.m. today under a car belonging to
contractor Allison Seeketso, parked outside his house, the
statement said.
   ``Fortunately, neither Mr. Seeketso, his wife nor any of his
four children who were sleeping in the house were injured,'' it
said.
   It could not immediately be determined if Seketso is in any way
affiliated with the ANC.
   The statement said Botswana ``reiterates its position that the
problems of apartheid in South Africa will not be solved by
cross-border raids, murder of innocent civilians and shooting of
unarmed policemen in cold blood.''
   ``We once more condemn those acts of state terrorism by the
South African government.''
   South African commandos have conducted several raids in Gaborone
against people they say are black nationalist guerrillas using the
Botswana capital as a staging post for sabotage attacks in South
Africa.
   South African soldiers killed three women and one man in March
when they raided a house and waged a gun battle on the edge of the
city.
   South Africans killed one person in a May 1986 attack against
alleged hideouts of ANC guerrillas. Fifteen were killed in a June,
1985, South African raid.
   Botswana officials have often denied the presence of ANC
guerrillas, although the government is sympathetic to the ANC's
aims.
   The ANC seeks to end the apartheid system of race-segregation,
to install a one-man, one-vote political system and to establish
government controls over major economic sectors.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
Tuesday he will tell U.S. critics of Israel that his country has to
respond forcefully to an Arab rebellion if it wants to remain an
independent state.
   Palestinian leaders of the 6{-month uprising have ``far-reaching
political goals that can endanger Israel's future and its
security,'' Rabin said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``If we would like to remain an independent Jewish state ... we
must be strong,'' Rabin said. ``We cannot accept the present level
of violence against us.''
   He also said all Israelis, and not just the army, had the job of
defending towns and settlements.
   ``We have to try together, the military and the civilians, to
take all the measures (needed) to put down the violence,'' he said
in his office within the walled Defense Ministry compound in Tel
Aviv. ``Everyone has to be aware, prepared, equipped.''
   The 66-year-old former Israeli prime minister and army chief of
staff is scheduled to go to the United States in the next few days
to meet with officials including President Reagan. His itinerary
was not revealed for security reasons.
   U.S. officials have expressed disapproval of some Israeli
tactics to quell Arab unrest in the occupied territories and are
expected to voice their concerns to Rabin during his visit.
   Most recently, they have questioned Rabin's statements
encouraging civilians to carry weapons and open fire on Arabs armed
with firebombs.
   But Rabin said he was right to urge civilians to shoot in
self-defense and added that if an Israeli farmer killed this week
had been carrying a gun, he would still be alive today.
   ``I am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would,''
Rabin said. ``I believe the results would be entirely different. He
would be alive today.''
   The body of Eli Cohen, 33, was found Monday in his vineyard
south of Jerusalem. He had been bludgeoned and stabbed to death,
and police have blamed Arab nationalists for the attack.
   ``In a way,'' Rabin said, ``we can call the last 40 years the
continuing war of independence ... and we are determined to meet
violence by force.''
   Rabin also disclosed he had met four times in recent weeks with
more than a dozen Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories
and said the sessions were fruitful simply because they kept the
channels of communication open.
   ``It was not in the format of negotiations. We just exchanged
views, sometimes conflicting views,'' Rabin said.
   He declined to identify them, saying some of those with whom he
had met had received death threats. But he said the Palestinians
``represent a wide variety of opinions.''
   He stressed that ``none of them is formally a member of any of

   Israel views the Palestine Liberation Organization as a

   Japan reported 1,346,666 births last year, a record
low partly due to the later age at which women are marrying, the
Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday in its annual report.
   A ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the nation's birth rate fell to a record low of 11.1 per 1,000
people in 1987.
   Japans previous lowest birth rate was in 1986, when 11.4 babies
were born per 1,000 people, the official said.
   The official said the average Japanese woman married at the age
of 26.5 years in 1986, up from 25.7 years in 1978.
   Japan recorded 751,181 deaths last year _ 6.2 deaths per 1,000 _
or 561 more than the year before, the official said. The population
in October was 121.5 million.

   A federal judge has sentenced an outspoken
fundamentalist minister to 21 months in prison for the attempted
bombing of a family planning clinic by anti-abortion protesters.
   ``I am genuinely sorry for what I've done,'' the Rev. Dorman
Owens told the judge at Monday's hearing. ``I've tried to right
every wrong. Now, for my sake and for the sake of my people, I'm
asking for mercy and leniency.''
   U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam also sentenced Owens to five
years probation, during which time he is forbidden from
participating in anti-abortion protests or preaching on the subject.
   Owens, 54, the fundamentalist pastor of the Santee-based Bible
Missionary Fellowship, pleaded guilty to charges of witness
tampering and willfully concealing knowledge of the bombing attempt
from authorities.
   A follower of Owens, Jo Anne Kreipal, 37, was sentenced to 15
months in prison at the same hearing for her role in the July 27,
1987, attempted bombing at the Alvarado Hospital Medical Center
clinic.
   Authorities uncovered the plot after another church member was
seen planting the pipe bomb, which failed to go off. The man later
cooperated with investigators, and is scheduled to be sentenced
July 25.
   The pastor and his followers frequently picketed clinics in the
area in protest of abortion services.
   The judge allowed both Owens and Kreipel to remain free until
they surrender themselves on July 11.

   Three days of violent street clashes
between ethnic Indians and native Pakistanis in the southern city
of Hyderabad has left 15 people dead, officials said Tuesday.
   The riots began Saturday after the Pakistanis opened fire on the
Moslem Indians, whose families had emigrated to this country after
its partition from India in 1947.
   Officials on Monday lifted a curfew in Hyderabad, 84 miles north
of Karachi, for one hour, and five people were stabbed or shot to
death and 15 wounded.
   Army troops sealed off the city with barbed wire.
   Riots in the past two years have killed hundreds of people in
the southern province of Sind, which includes Hyderabad and
Karachi, a port city where the ethnic groups share cramped slums
and compete for jobs.

   An administrative judge has dismissed a
$1,000 state fine against Maria DeSillers for failing to register
as a charity when raising money to pay medical bills for her son's
liver transplants.
   Administrative Hearing Officer Donald Alexander said all the
money donated to Ronnie DeSillers' mother for his liver transplants
now belongs to the boy's estate. He said that means the money is
not subject to state charity laws.
   In a decision released today, Alexander emphasized that he was
not ruling on whether Mrs. DeSillers received or used the money
legitimately, but only whether she was required to register as a
charity.
   There are other court remedies available for those questioning
her use of the money, he said.
   Ronnie DeSillers, 7, died at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh
last year while awaiting a fourth liver transplant. His plight
resulted in a highly publicized fund-raising drive that included a
$1,000 donation from President Reagan.
   According to court documents, almost $300,000 of the $527,000
that remained in Ronnie's account when he died has been spent.
About $243,500 remains in the estate.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived
for this year's summit of Western leaders ready to take care of
business in a hurry.
   A Canadian official involved in running the summit says that
before Sunday's opening session, Mrs. Thatcher was looking around
the room where the world leaders were about to launch three days of
meetings over an octagonal table.
   West Germany's Hans-Dietrich Genscher, on his way to the
separate meeting with his fellow foreign ministers, poked his head
in the room and Mrs. Thatcher bantered with him briefly about his
tan and other topics.
   As Genscher waved good-bye, Mrs. Thatcher told him jokingly,
''I'll go to the table, work on the communique and have it finished
by the time the others arrive.''

   With the exception of Tuesday's closing news conferences, only a

   So reporters have tried to make the most of the brief ``photo
opportunities'' that were held as the leaders came and went.
   One of the finer exchanges of the three-day summit:
   ``Anything new on Haiti, Mr. President,'' a reporter shouted at
Ronald Reagan.
   No answer.
   ``Anything old?''

<TEXT>
   A splinter group within the
striking Writers Guild of America announced today it would oppose
the union leadership and call for approval of the latest producers'
offer to end the 16-week-old strike.
   About 300 members of the Writers Coalition met Monday night and
voted to oppose the guild at Wednesday night membership meetings in
New York and Los Angeles, where the contract will be voted on.
   ``The feeling that came out of the meeting is that the board and
negotiating committee are very much out of touch with the (guild)
membership,'' said publicist and guild member Dick Guttman, who
attended the Writers Coalition meeting.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers offered
a $71 million contract last Thursday, but the Writers Guild said
the economic package on foreign and one-hour residuals was
unacceptable.
   Writers Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden, who said union
officials were aware of the coalition meeting Monday night, today
urged members ``to wait until Wednesday night's meeting to hear the
presentation on the proposal before they give their proxies to
anyone to vote.''
   The coalition claims about 600 members within the 9,000-member
union. But its members are among the guild's most frequently
employed, and therefore the biggest contributors to its health,
welfare and pension fund, coalition leaders have said.
   It also includes several of the industry's top ``hyphenates'' _
writer-producers who hold union cards but also have become
management by starting their own production companies.
   Among those in the coalition are ``L.A. Law'' producer-writer
Steve Bochco; Stephen Cannell, who produces ``Hunter''; and John
Hughes, producer and writer of such films as ``The Great Outdoors''
and ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles.''
   The coalition has been working behind the scenes since the
beginning of the strike, but made no public pronouncements until
last week, when the union's negotiating committee and East and West
Coast boards decided to reject the producers' latest offer.
   The strike vote on Wednesday comes on the eve of the new
television production season.

   More than 4,000 striking truck and
metal workers in the northern republic of Slovenia marched Tuesday
to protest low wages, sources reported.
   The workers met with officials in the city of Maribor, about 15
miles south of the Austrian border, and demanded a 50 percent pay
increase, said the sources, who requested anonymity.
   The workers, who were from the Tam truck-manufacturing plant and
the Primat metal factory, earn an average wage of about $210 a
month, according to the Tanjug news agency, though Slovenia is
Yugoslavia's wealthiest republic.
   The government has linked wages to industrial productivity as
part of a severe austerity program designed to cut Yugoslavia's 170
percent inflation rate and its $21 billion debt.
   Last week, about 5,000 agricultural workers rallied in front of
the Parliament in the capital of Belgrade to demand better living
standards.

   The government has sent to parliament a
bill allowing conscientious objectors to the draft to serve three
years of alternative civilian service, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   The alternative service for males exempted from military duty
will be shorter than outlined earlier this year, said government
spokesman Jerzy Urban.
   In January, the government said it was considering requiring
draftees who qualified for alternative service to perform four
years of alternative service.
   Under a bill approved by the Council of Ministers on Monday,
however, it will last three years, while students released from
military obligations will be required to serve only one to two
years, Urban said.
   A military commission that will include civilian participants
will be established to consider the requests to determine the
authenticity of the applicant's motives, Urban said.
   Current law mandates that all young men perform up to two years
of military service.
   The banned peace group Freedom and Peace has campaigned for the
establishment of alternative service since the group was formed in
1985.
   Only last week the group scored its greatest success to date
when parliament adopted a new military oath that drops any
reference to serving alongside the Soviet army.
   Urban refused to comment on the fate of 16 members of the group
which the group says are imprisoned either for refusing to serve in
the army or to take the oath.
   The Supreme Military court in Warsaw on Tuesday upheld the
2{-year sentence of Freedom and Peace supporter Rafal Budzbon, a
spokesman for the group said.

<HEAD>Reagan Backs New Fair Housing Law, Michel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has given his support to
compromise legislation to strengthen enforcement of
anti-discrimination laws in housing, a Republican leader said
Tuesday.
   Rep. Robert H. Michel, R-Ill, the House minority leader, said
Tuesday that Reagan told him from by telephone from the Toronto
economic summit that he believes the agreement between
congressional liberals and conservatives, as well as between civil
rights groups and real estate agents, ``preserves the
constitutional right to jury trials and (he) hopes the Congreess
will move quickly on the legislation to strengthen fair housing
laws.''
   Michel made his comments at a news conference attended by
congressional leaders, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights
and the National Association of Realtors.
   The House should take up the fair housing legislation either
Wednesday afternoon or Thursday. The Senate also is expected to act
quickly after the House approves the measure.
   The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation on April 27
which would authorize the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to levy fines and issue injunctions against people who
discriminate in the rental or sale of housing.
   Under current law, HUD can play only a conciliatory role,
attempting to mediate housing disputes. Enforcement of the law
depends on private individuals, who can take a discrimination case
to court, and on the Justice Department, which has authority to
prosecute if there is evidence of a ``pattern or practice'' of
housing discrimiantion.
   The bill sets up a new system of administrative law judges who
would hear cases of alleged housing discrimination. If a party were
dissatisfied with the decision, he or she then could go to federal
court.
   The Reagan administration and the Realtors contended that the
process was constitutionally flawed because it would subject a
defendant to fines without benefit of a jury trial, as required
under the Constitution's 7th Amendement.
   The compromise, to come as an amendment proposed by Rep.
Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y., will provide that any party charged with
housing discrimination can elect to have the accusation litigated
in federal court. If no such election is made, the case will be
handled by the administrative process.
   Rep. Don Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary civil and
constitutional rights subcommittee, said, ``We believe (the bill)
will do the job of putting teeth into fair housing law.
   ``Besides putting teeth into fair housing laws, (it) provides
anti-discrimination protection to individuals with handicaps and to
families with children,'' Edwards told the news conference. ``These
new classes need protection, as our long study of the matter has
clearly pointed out. These provisions are an essential part of the
bill.''
   Nestor R. Weigand Jr., president of the Realtors, said the
compromise was a milestone in the history of fair housing
legislation. ``Our respective organizations have been able to
overcome their disagreements of the past decade and come to an
agreement that will ensure free and equal access to housing for all
Americans, as well as expedite enforcement proceedings in fair
housing disputes.''
   Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader, and Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, each said he expects the Senate to act
promptly and complete action on the bill before Congress recesses
for the year.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nobel Prize-winning American professor will
become master of the Oxford University college where he once taught
and studied, officials said Tuesday.
   Baruch Blumberg, a professor of medecine and anthropology at the
University of Pennsylvania, will take over the post at Balliol
College next year when the present master, Anthony Kenny, steps
down, according to a Balliol official who asked not to be
identified.
it's in recognition of the international character
of Balliol (that I was chosen),'' Blumberg was quoted as telling
The Times of London from his home in Philadelphia.
   He said he was ``e   ``I believe xcited and honored'' to have been
chosen.
   An Oxford spokeswoman, Anne Lonsdale, said it was believed that
Blumberg would be the first American to head Balliol, but the
Balliol official was unsure. Americans currently are masters of
three of Oxford's other 34 colleges.
   According to Oxford's college system, students live and work at
one college during their course of study and undergraduates apply
to individual colleges rather than to the university for admission.
   Blumberg received a doctor of philosophy in biochemistry in 1955
from Balliol and taught there as a visiting professor in 1983-84,
said the official, reading from a statement.
   In 1976, Blumberg won a Nobel Prize in physiology and medecine
fore over. Days lost to
strikes have fallen from 29 million in 1979 to just 2.5 million in
the year up to March.
   Unemployment is one reason, but another is Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's legislation, which forces unions to take strike
votes and obtain a 55-percent yes-vote before calling a walkout.
The legislation also outlaws secondary picketing, and no longer
requires employers to recognize a union even if employees have
chosen it in a vote.
   The Trades Union Congress is threatening to expel the EETPU
electricians at its annual meeting in September over single-union
deals.
   At the same time, the EETPU is asking its members in a ballot
whether to pull out of the TUC and talking to the AEU about joining
forces to form their own breakaway organization that would take
away one-ninth of the TUC's membership.
   ``Such a split in the union movement would change the face of
industrial relations and have serious implications for the Labor
Party,'' the Independent newspaper wrote.
   The Labor Party is the main opposition to Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party government, and the unions are the Laborites
power base.
   The Wakefield factory, which is Europe's newest soft-drink
plant, ``is going to mean a lot for the community of Wakefield,''
said Mayor George Parkinson.
   Dick Croft, a local official for the engineering union that will
represent the Wakefield plant workers, said the community was lucky
that Coke and Cadbury decided to have any union at all.
   The new style has been introduced largely by egalitarian-minded
Japanese companies that have abolished separate dress codes, put in
employee canteens and provided parking lots for hourly workers as
well as for management.
   They offer enticing wages in return for high productivity and
shopfloor moderation. British workers have embraced the change,
confounding those who accuse them of resisting change and upholding
class distinctions.
   Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, argues that
single-union deals encourage damaging competition among unions for
a smaller pool of members in the trade union movement.
   The 1.35-million-member Transport and General Workers Union,
Britain's largest, also is a major opponent of the new style for
pretty much the same reasons.
   But up here in Yorkshire, the engineering union's Croft said,
``The world is changing. We don't enjoy the same franchise we had a
few years ago.''

   Tourists standing in line at the Washington
Monument flinched in surprise Tuesday as federal safety officials
blew two dressed turkeys to bits in a demonstration of the dangers
of fireworks.
   A pair of watermelons also met their end as the Consumer Product
Safety Commission used the monument grounds to conduct its annual
pre-Fourth of July event for the news media.
   ``This July 4th marks Uncle Sam's 212th birthday. What better
way to celebrate than to make sure that fireworks do not spoil the
occasion,'' commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon said.
   Federal and state laws ban firecrackers with more than 50
milligrams of powder _ the small, finger-type firecrackers. But
agency officials acknowledge that large illegal items, such as
cherry bombs, M-80 and M-100s can still be obtained.
   The M-100s were used to blast the thawed turkeys, blowing them
apart and scattering pieces about. The birds were used to simulate
what could happen to a human being.
   The effect on the watermelons was similar, if more colorful.
   The safety commission also announced that during the last five
months it has seized some 57 million units of illegal fireworks in
a cooperative program with the U.S. Customs Service at 15 ports of
entry.
   Problems found in the products included overloaded fireworks,
defective fuses, unstable bases, casings which blow out on the side
and improper warning labels.
   The commission said approximately 9,000 injuries involving
fireworks were treated at hospital emergency rooms last year, down
from 12,600 in 1986.
   To avoid becoming one of those statistics, Scanlon offered a
series of safety tips:
   _Always read and follow label instructions.
   _Ignite fireworks outdoors only.
   _Make sure an an adult is present whenever fireworks are used.
   _Have a bucket of water at hand in the event of a fire and for
dousing apparent duds.
   _Never try to re-light a firework that does not go off.
   _Never carry fireworks in a pocket and don't throw them.
   _Light only one at a time.
   _Do not set off fireworks in a metal or glass container.

<TEXT>
   Traditionalist Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre said Tuesday that cooperation with the Vatican is no
longer possible, and he reaffirmed his decision to consecrate four
bishops without papal authority.
   Lefebvre announcement last week to consecrate the bishops on
June 30 drew public warnings from Pope John Paul II and European
Roman Catholic church leaders.
   Elevating bishops without papal permission seems certain to
result in the Frenchman's excommunication from the church and its
first split since an 1870 schism over the dogma of papal
infallibility.
   In a statement, the 82-year-old Lefebvre accused the Vatican of
``continuous and cruel persecution to force our submission'' to the
reforms launched by the Second Vatican Council in 1962-65.
   The church will need years ``to find its way back to its
2,000-year-old tradition,'' the founder and leader of the
traditionalist St. Pius X fraternity in Switzerland said. The
movement will defend this tradition, which is ``the only
possibility for the renewal of the church,'' he said.
   The relationship with the Vatican ``no longer in any way points
to brotherly cooperation and a pure and simple recognition of the
fraternity,'' Lefebvre said.
   He has said the consecration of four of his followers is needed
to ensure the survival of his movement, which claims millions of
followers worldwide.
   According to the Vatican, a May 5 agreement between the pope and
Lefebvre gave the archbishop the right to consecrate one bishop on
Aug. 15. In return, Lefebvre would have promised to be faithful to
the church and the pope, and accept the teachings of the Second
Vatican Council.
   Lefebvre insisted on the June 30 date and on elevating four
bishops, effectively repudiating the accord.
   On Thursday, the Vatican published the text of a letter from the
pope to Lefebvre that urged him to renounce the ``schismatic'' act.
The presidents of the French, West German and Swiss bishops'
conferences did the same.
   Lefebvre, whose movement uses the Latin-language tridentine
mass, has spoken out for some two decades against the Second
Vatican Council.
   The council led to the celebration of Mass in local languages,
an enlargement of the role of lay people, and opening of the church
to other faiths.
   Excommunication is the last sanction left in the Vatican's
arsenal of measures against Lefebvre.
   In 1976, Pope Paul VI suspended him from his priestly functions
_ barring him from saying Mass and giving the sacraments _ but
Lefebvre ignored the order. He continued to ordain priests and
criticize the Vatican.

following a successful launching of its Ariane-4 rocket, which
first lifted satellites into orbit on June 15.
   On July 21, an older Ariane-type rocket is to fire a European
telecommunications satellite and an Indian satellite into orbit.
   An American telecommunications satellite will go up Sept. 8,
followed by the Oct. 26 launching of France's first television
satellite.
   The second launch of the Ariane-4, which is more versatile and
can carry heavier loads than its predecessors, is to take place in
November.
   In December, the final Ariane launch of the year will carry the
international communications satellite INTELSAT-5 F-15 into space.

<HEAD>Yeutter: Japan Pact on Beef, Oranges Should Help Overall Trade
Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new agreement with Japan on beef and oranges
will be a positive element in general trade negotiations,
particularly with the European Economic Community, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   ``It should provide some additional psychological support for us
in dealing with the Europeans,'' Yeutter said. ``In other words,
now that we've been able to strike a deal with the Japanese on beef
and citrus, it puts some additional pressure on the Europeans to be
somewhat more accommodating than they have in the past.''
   With the Japanese starting to come into line, it could put EEC
leaders in the position of looking ``like the villains of the
agricultural world'' if they continue holding out, he said.
   Yeutter, who earlier this week returned from Tokyo where the new
agreement was reached after marathon negotiations, told a telephone
conference with broadcast and newspaper reporters that Japan agreed
to open the door to more American beef and citrus in the face of
further U.S. challenges under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, or GATT.
   The agreement could lead to a doubling of U.S. exports of beef
and oranges by 1991 to more than $1 billion a year. In return, the
United States agreed to withdraw its GATT complaint against Japan
restrictive import quotas.
   Yeutter said the complaint _ and previous success under GATT
rules last year _ helped prod Japan into accepting an expansion of
beef and citrus.
   ``In other words, the jig was up,'' he said. ``They'd gotten
away with a continuation of these programs for a lot of years. What
we, the United States, should have done was challenge these things
about 15 years ago instead of now, but better late than never.''
   Yeutter said he did not expect serious problems in Japan living
up to the new agreement, although officials should be watchful.
   ``I don't see any loopholes there for the government of Japan to
use three years or so in the future,'' he said. ``But one can never
be sure. Governments are very creative on these kinds of things,
and they'll sometimes find loopholes or build loopholes where
they're not around today.''

<HEAD>Squabbles Between Atlanta And Columbus Groups Mar Miss Georgia
Pageant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miss Georgia beauty pageant has become the
focus of squabbling btween state and local pageant officials,
rumors that the winner already has been picked and complaints that
blacks can't win.
   The pageant begins Wednesday in Columbus with Atlanta's entry
dethroned and its pageant organization shut out, and a
representative of the Miss America pageant is on hand to monitor
proceedings.
   Critics say the Miss Georgia pageant has evolved into a
competition dominated by ``professional pageant girls''
professionally coached and dressed in $2,500 custom-made evening
gowns and $120 ``supersuits'' for the swimsuit competition, who
travel around the state easily winning titles in pageants without
residency requirements.
   The Scholarship Atlanta Foundation Inc., which operates the Miss
Atlanta pageant, had its franchise lifted by the state group
because it took the Miss Atlanta crown away from Faith Ann Brown,
22, of Kennesaw.
   The Atlanta board said Miss Brown violated her contract by
working with an unauthorized talent coach. The first and second
runners-up had won other pageants, so the crown went to third
runner-up Jennifer Anderson of Dunwoody.
   Scholarship Atlanta complained to the Miss America pageant
officials, saying the Georgia pageant is tightly controlled, no
black has ever been awarded the crown, and the 40-member board has
traditionally been all-white and almost exclusively residents of
the pageant host city.
   Then rumors surfaced that the new Miss Georgia already has been
picked and simply will be confirmed this year. Miss Atlanta board
member Kim Styes Foley wrote a letter to Miss America officials,
contending Frances Frazier, last year's first runner-up and this
year's Miss Peachtree City, said she has been promised the state
crown.
   ``That's just not true at all,'' said Miss Frazier, 26, a Rome
entertainer. ``I have not been told by anybody that the crown would
be mine.''
   In May, Lee York, a member of the Scholarship Atlanta Foundation
and a former Miss Georgia board member, also wrote to Miss America
officials, saying he had ``firsthand knowledge'' blacks were not
being given a fair shot at the crown.
   Miss Georgia board President Joe Dickens acknowledged that the
pageant has never had a black board member but said ``no black has
ever applied.''
   Lindsay Barton, vice president for franchises for Miss Georgia,
said he was insulted by the Atlanta group's charge of racism. Last
year, a black female judge from Atlantic City helped judge Miss
Georgia, and this year, he said, ``at least two of our hostesses
happen to be black. We've had a number of blacks in the
competition, and a lot have finished in the Top 10.''
   The black contestant who finished highest in recent years,
Barton said, was Kym Clark, who as Miss Peachtree City finished in
the Top 10 in 1985.
   Miss Clark, 28, a television reporter in Memphis, Tenn., says
she encountered subtle racism but was reluctant to raise the issue.
   ``I don't know if it's the judges who don't want a black Miss
Georgia or if it's some of the pageant officials,'' she said.
``They (pageant officials) have a lot of influence with the
judges.''
   James Lees, president of the board of directors of the Miss
America pageant, said Friday that a representative was sent to
Georgia.
   The Miss Georgia pageant is among the most successful in the
Miss America system, but Georgia has not had a Miss America since
1953, when Neva Jane Langley of Macon won the title.

<HEAD>Jackson-Based Group Wins Contract For Soviet Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mississippi group has beat out 300
competitors _ most of them based in New York, Los Angeles and other
big cities _ to win the contract for a major cultural-exchange
exhibit that will tour the Soviet Union.
   ``This is the first time we have chosen a design group from the
South,'' said Ron Underwood, project director for the U.S.
Information Agency, the government office sponsoring the exhibit.
   The exhibit, called Design USA, will be produced by
Yoknapatawpha Exhibit Group, USIA officials announced Monday. The
group is a joint venture of two Jackson firms _ Communication Arts
Co., a graphic design and media production studio, and
Mockbee-Coker-Howorth Architects.
   The exhibit will showcase U.S. architecture, product design,
graphic design and design education. It will tour nine Soviet
cities in 18 months, starting in Moscow next June.
   In its proposal, the group emphasized its Mississippi
background. Yoknapatawpha is the fictional Mississippi county that
was the setting for several works by Nobel Prize-winning novelist
William Faulkner.
   Jeanne B. Luckett, vice president of Communication Arts, noted
the group's experience with the Mississippi pavilion at the New
Orleans World's Fair. She said the challenge there was to sell the
attributes of a state that is often stereotyped and misunderstood.
   ``We figured that if we could do that for Mississippi, we could
do it for the United States to the Soviets,'' Luckett said.
   Underwood said the USIA liked the way the Mississippi group
grasped and expressed the exhibit's concept: the role design plays
in the everyday life of Americans.
   He said the group's design model ``was far and away superior to
any of the others, and the others were done by some of the most
highly thought-of design firms in the country.''
   Underwood said exhibit designers often ``think of the details
instead of the big picture. This group grasped the big picture and
expressed it very effectively. They're just very creative people.''
   Design USA is the second traveling USIA exhibit to result from
the 1985 cultural exchange agreement between President Reagan and
Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The first, which is
touring the Soviet Union now, deals with communications.
   ``This is a wonderful opportunity for the people of America to
touch the people of the Soviet Union in a very dynamic way,'' said
Hap Owen, president of Communication Arts.
   ``In this period of perestroika, or `rebuilding,' the Soviets
are open to new ways of designing and manufacturing. They are
realizing that their lifestyles, products and built environments
can be enhanced through better design.
   ``We are not going to put on a trade show of products and
services,'' Owen said. ``We are seeking to explain how our society
expresses itself through design and how, therefore, our quality of
life is improved.''
   The cost of the Design USA contract won't be known for several
months. Components of the 13,450-square-foot exhibit will fill 40
18-wheeler trucks.

   Harvey, called Monday as a potential juror for a murder trial,
told the court if it started to rain he'd have to leave so he could
plant his soybeans. He also said if it started to rain while he was
on the jury, he wouldn't be able to keep his mind on the trial.
   District Judge Lewis O. Lauve excused Harvey, who is from

   Isaac Asimov celebrated the 50th year of his
prolific writing career on Tuesday.
   ``You can't have a 50th anniversary of your professional life
without feeling a little old,'' said Asimov. ``I feel like a
survivor.''
   On June 21, 1938, Asimov walked into the offices of Analog
Science Fiction-Science Fact, then called Astounding, and submitted
his first story to Editor John W. Campbell Jr.
   To date, he has published 351 short stories, with nine more
currently in press; 391 books, with 21 more in press; and at least
2,000 short, non-fiction pieces.
   And at 68, he has no intention of relaxing: ``I'll keep on
writing. As long as I breathe, I'll write.''
   Through the years, Asimov also has counseled other writers.
   ``The main advice I give them is to develop a thick skin against
frustration and disappointment. That's the lot of the average
writer,'' said this far-from-average writer, who conceded modestly,
``I've been a very lucky one.''

   Giorgio Moroder, composer of the music
for ``Flashdance,'' unveiled Tuesday the official song of the 1988
Olympics, a pop ballad that says ``we can make this world a better
world.''
   Moroder said he sought to compose a song ``with that quality
that distinguishes the Olympics,'' that would be easy listening for
people of all nationalities and that would have a Korean flavor.
   ``Hand in Hand'' is scheduled for release on an album in
mid-July and is to be sung at the Olympic opening ceremonies Sept.
17 by the Korean quartet Koreana.
   ``Hand in hand, we can start to understand breaking down the
walls that come between us for all time. Arirang,'' says the song,
set to a heavy percussion beat. ``Arirang'' is a Korean folk song
about the emotions of parting from loved ones. The orchestration
includes Korean drums and flutes.
   The Italian-born composer has won Oscars for the score of
``Midnight Express,'' for ``What a Feeling,'' from ``Flashdance,''
and for ``Take My Breath Away,'' from ``Top Gun.''

   So he ought to know just how to go about his new project _
``Peter Pan,'' the first production of a new children's theater at
Robert Redford's Sundance Institute.
   Sendak was appointed artistic director to head the project under
an $800,000 grant from the Eccles Foundation, Redford said Sunday
at his canyon resort. Other funding will come from AT&T and NBC,
Redford said.
   Sendak said his objective was to produce honest, quality theater

   ``Good children's theater does not reduce or patronize,'' he
said.
   Redford said the first production of ``Peter Pan'' is planned
for 1990.

   For fans of artist Al Hirschfeld, there was a
twist Tuesday on his usual game.
   A story in The New York Times on Tuesday, Hirschfeld's 85th
birthday, had a small ``6'' next to the byline, indicating there
were six ``Ninas'' in the text.
   Normally, the name of Hirschfeld's daughter, Nina, appears in
his sketches, with the number of times revealed next to the
artist's name.
   ``Nina was born on Oct. 20, 1945, and on that day I put in a
drawing, in a circus poster in the background, a little baby
reading a book called `Nina the Wonder Child,''' he said. ``And
since then it has become a national insanity.''
   On Monday, celebrities from the art and theater worlds turned
out at the Margo Feiden Galleries, where much of Hirschfeld's work
is displayed, to honor the man who has captured many of their
likenesses.
   The artist, known for his caricatures of celebrities as diverse
as Humphrey Bogart, Superman and Albert Einstein, estimates
conservatively that he has sketched more than 3,000 drawings.
   In the Times, where many of his caricatures are published,
Hirschfeld said his career began in the 1920's when a friend who
happened to be a press agent saw a caricature he had sketched on a
theater program.
   That sketch was sold to The Herald Tribune, which wanted another
one the following week. About a year later, the Times started
requesting sketches and Hirschfeld kept them coming.
   Hirschfeld said drawing feeds his ``insatiable appetite for pure
line, for distillation, for bringing things down to the simplest
form.''

<HEAD>Job Programs In Four States Boost Earnings Of Welfare Recipients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Job programs in four states boosted the
long-term earnings of welfare recipients and saved some states
money, bolstering the case for welfare reform bills pending in
Congress, according to a study released Tuesday.
   The study of programs in Arkansas, Maine, Maryland and Virginia
yielded ``important new results that point to the long-term
effectiveness of recent state welfare employment initiatives,''
according to the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., which
conducts independent research on social policy issues.
   ``We have known for some time that these programs increase
employment and earnings in the short term. We now know that these
results continue for at least three years,'' said Judith Gueron,
president of the group.
   ``As Congress moves forward with welfare reform legislation,
this information gives us new confidence about the impact and
cost-effectiveness of a key part of this reform,'' she said in a
statement.
   MDRC has been conducting large-scale studies of welfare
employment programs in eight states for six years. Its findings
helped shape the House and Senate welfare overhaul bills now
awaiting reconciliation in a conference committee.
   The pivotal element of both bills is a large-scale education,
training and jobs program with a special focus on teen-aged mothers
and others likely to be on welfare for long periods.
   Gueron said the earnings gains found in the MDRC study, though
they continued for the full three years, were relatively modest.
``The programs themselves do not appear to move a large percentage
of the welfare caseload out of poverty,'' she said.
   MDRC researchers evaluated low- to moderate-cost programs in
Arkansas, Virginia and Maryland which required participation by
women with children over three or six. Earnings gains in the final
year of the study averaged $300 to $500 per person.
   MDRC called the averages notable because they were based on all
people eligible for the programs, not just the 50 percent or so
that actually participated.
   Researchers also studied Training Opportunities in the Private
Sector, one option in Maine's welfare employment program. It
involved voluntary participation by screened participants and
offered lengthier, more intensive services than those available in
the other states' broader programs.
   MDRC said the program was much smaller-scale and had atypical
enrollees, and resulted in increased earnings of $952 in the third
year of follow-up.
   The Maine and Maryland programs did not result in any welfare
savings. But average welfare payments to participants in Arkansas
in the third year were 18 percent less than payments to those in a
control group; in Virginia, the average payments were 8 percent
less.

   A cancer patient who was pronounced dead
in the hospital awoke later in a mortuary, and she said her
superstitious relatives were afraid to visit her, it was reported
Tuesday.
   The family of Beauty Shitto had made funeral arrangements to
bury her after doctors at the hospital in Gweru, 160 miles
southwest of Harare, declared her dead and sent her body to the
mortuary, the semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency
reported.
   The relatives slaughtered a cow and a goat for the funeral
feast, the news agency reported.
   Mrs. Shitto told the news agency that she awoke ``in a certain
small room'' in the mortuary.
   Her sister, Margaret, ran away in fear when she saw her alive
and other relatives were sympathetic but ``nervous,'' Mrs. Shitto
said.
   ``My death and subsequent rising from the dead baffled
everyone,'' she said. ``I cannot remember anything that happened
while I was dead.''
   ZIANA said Health Ministry officials confirmed the incident but
declined to say how long she was unconcious in the mortuary.

   A Yale alumnus accused of setting afire
shanties erected on the university campus as an anti-apartheid
protest entered an innocent plea today and requested a jury trial.
   A lawyer for Dr. Elwood Bracey, of West Palm Beach, Fla., who
didn't appear in court, entered the plea in New Haven Superior
Court.
   A date for a pretrial hearing on the charge of third-degree
arson was set for July 14. No one was injured in the incident.
   Anti-apartheid activists, meanwhile, have declared unacceptable
a proposal by the university administration under which a
40-foot-long memorial wall could be reconstructed on campus on a
limited basis if the Coalition Against Apartheid agreed to
voluntarily dismantle the structure and store it for at least the
summer.
   The wall, covered with pictures and statements in support of the
anti-apartheid movement, replaced the shanties destroyed in the
fire June 5.
   Last week, the Yale administration announced that the wall could
remain up only for four days, through noon Monday. However, when
the deadline arrived, the administration didn't try to take down
the wall, but instead proposed a compromise.
   The coalition immediately rejected the proposal.
   ``It's still the university telling us what to do,'' said
Charlotte Hitchcock, a Yale graduate student.
   The shanties and the wall were built by students and comunity
members seeking to end all Yale investment in companies doing
business in South Africa. The coalition said it would not take the
wall down until Yale fully divests itself of such stocks.
   Yale Secretary Sheila W. Wellington said Monday the burning of
the shanties and threats of arson since June 5 have made officials
conclude that the symbolic structures must be temporary, not
capable of being lived in and adequately protected.
   In addition, officials said, the shanties and wall were erected
on a granite plaza located over part of the Beinecke Rare Book and
Manuscript Library. Another fire might not only endanger human
safety, it could also pose a threat to some of the library's rare
documents, they said.
   University police have guarded continuously since it went up,
but officials said that isn't prudent use of police services.

   A young adult bear found itself in an
embarrassing spot Tuesday morning _ treed at a downtown
intersection.
   Someone on the way to work reported the bear _ estimated to
weigh about 300 pounds _ about 500 feet from Town Hall in this
North Country community of about 6,000 residents.
   ``I went directly underneath the tree and saw a bunch of brown
fur up there,'' said Jason La Flamme, who works in Town Hall. ``It
was resting comfortably.''
   A police officer said he had spotted the bear in the early
morning hours on the ground. Police speculated the patrol car may
have frightened the bear up the tree.
   Police and state Fish and Game Deparment officials said Tuesday
afternoon they were ``monitoring the situation'' because they
couldn't figure out what else to do.
   They hoped, they said, the bear would come down by itself.
   The animal is believed to be a black bear, which are common in
the area.

   Crops and livestock continue to suffer from
drought in much of the nation, but the effects vary widely, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility reported Tuesday.
   ``Precipitation across the northern Great Plains did very little
to ease the drought and improve crop condition'' during the week of
June 13-19, the facility said. ``The lack of moisture, combined
with high temperatures, stressed crops and slowed growth throughout
most of the eastern half of the nation.''
   About 23 percent of the winter wheat acreage had been harvested
by June 19, 6 percentage points ahead of a year ago as ``near ideal
weather'' pushed the harvest as far north as Illinois, the report
said.
   ``Corn was good to fair in the central Great Plains and fair in
most other major producing areas,'' the report said. ``Corn silking
was limited mostly to the Southeast and Delta. Georgia's corn was
more advanced, with some acreage finishing the (kernel) dough stage
and entering dent.''
   The report on the corn crop added: ``The average stalk height
exceeded the average in Illinois. Extreme dry conditions stressed
corn in Ohio, but earlier plantings fare better than late
plantings. The extreme heat rolled corn leaves in Nebraska.''
   Soybean plantings were 93 percent completed in the major
production states by June 19. Most planting during the week was in
the Corn Belt and central Great Plains.
   ``The lack of moisture hampered and, in some cases, halted
planting in the Delta and Southeast,'' the report said. ``Soybeans
were mostly fair (condition), but available moisture kept condition
good to fair in the central Great Plains. Soybeans suffered the
most in the Delta and Appalachian states where condition was fair
to poor.''
   Livestock pastures ``showed no signs of resurgence'' in the
eastern half of the nation, and producers began culling herds as
forage supplies declined, the report said.

<HEAD>Parliament Holds First Full Joint Debate To Discuss Blacks' Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament's three racially
segregated chambers held their first full-scale joint debate
Tuesday, discussing a bill that would expand blacks' political role
while keeping them out of Parliament.
   Most prominent black leaders have rejected the bill, which is
aimed at negotiating a power-sharing system in which the white
minority would retain political and economic control.
   The dominant white chamber of Parliament has sat previously with
the 4-year-old Asian and mixed-race chambers, but only for
ceremonial occasions and major speeches, not to debate legislation.
The only previous joint debates have been in committees, not among
the full chambers.
   On the agenda Tuesday was a controversial proposal to establish
a council that would negotiate a new constitutional system. The
government says the council also would provide a voice for blacks
in national affairs during the period of negotiations.
   The council, with a minimum membership of 36, would include
Cabinet ministers, provincial administrators, eight presidential
appointees, leaders of six semi-autonomous black homelands, and
nine blacks chosen on a regional basis by black municipal
councilors.
   The most prominent of the homeland leaders _ Chief Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi _ has declared that he won't participate on
the council until African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
is released from prison.
   More militant black leaders, as well as many anti-apartheid
whites, have rejected the bill outright, saying it is an attempt by
the government to evade demands for a one-man, one-vote democracy.
At present, the 5 million whites hold political and economic power,
while the 26 million blacks have voting rights only in homeland and
municipal elections.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis, speaking in
Parliament, described the bill as a legislative landmark.
   ``It is the first time in our history that legislation is being
introduced with the goal of laying a foundation for the
participation of all South Africans and communities in the
political and governing process,'' he said.
   ``Those who want to perpetuate racism will certainly say the
legislation is the last nail in the coffin of the whites,'' Heunis
said, adding that the bill would be ``mercilessly fought by
revolutionary and violent forces'' on the left.
   But he said South Africans interested in peaceful solutions will
view the bill as ``an attempt to give content to the high ideals of
liberation and freedom.''
   The Star, South Africa's largest daily newspaper, said in an
editorial Tuesday that ``no black leaders of consequence seem
disposed to take part'' in the council.
   The government ``will of course find black faces, somewhere, to
sit on the council, but they will not carry credibility,'' it said.
``The prognosis is not a happy one.''

<HEAD>International Task Force to Study Air Traffic Congestion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international agency has set up a task force to
examine ways to relieve airport congestion and flight delays that
have reached a ``crisis situation'' in Europe, a spokesman for the
group said Tuesday.
   The task force held its first meeting May 25 in Montreal, where
it mapped out a working plan to tackle problems created by an
increase in aircraft takeoffs and landings, especially in Europe,
said International Air Transport Association spokesman David Kyd.
   Kyd said in an interview with The Associated Press that aircraft
movements in Europe had increased by 7 percent this year compared
with 1987, and that last year's level may double by the year 2002.
   ``It is now a crisis situation. Everybody's waking up to it,''
he said.
   The six-member committee will examine the traffic problem
worldwide, but is starting with Europe where the problem is most
acute, Kyd said.
   One idea the task force was studying was the possibility of
ending night curfews at airports in order to increase their
capacity, because new quiet jets can land ``almost with their
engines shut down'' and therefore create less noise, he said.
   The task force also was looking at the entire air traffic
control system, and is likely to encourage governments to hire more
air traffic controllers and raise their salaries, Kyd said.
   The task force will meet again in September in London, he said.

   More than two-dozen demonstrators were arrested
Tuesday when they staged a sit-in outside the art museum where
summit leaders, aides and spouses were to have lunch.
   For the second time in three days, protesters marched down a
major city thoroughfare, saying they wanted to serve a ``citizens
warrant'' for the arrest of the leaders of the summit nations, the
United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West
Germany.
   The self-styled warrant accused the seven summit nations of
crimes against humanity, ranging from U.S. backing for the
Nicaraguan Contras to persuing economic policies which, they said,
have been responsible for the deaths of poverty stricken people in
major Western cities.
   ``They're the criminals, not us'' and ``Arrest the G-7,'' the
protesters chanted.
   One organizer, Michaele Shapcott, said, ``They're sitting in
there for the cameras saying basically, things are O.K.' but we're
saying, `Listen folks, things are not O.K.'''
   The site of the demonstration, the Art Gallery of Ontario, was
selected by summit organizers as the locale for the final lunch
among the leaders, their spouses and top aides.
   But the final summit session ran late, and the demonstration was
over by the time the summit participants arrived.
   The protesters, who numbered 75 in all, were met by police
barricades and about 100 officers in three ranks, backed by mounted
police.
   One young woman, waving a ``warrant,'' told Toronto policeman
P.E. Semple: ``These people are criminals. We would like you to go
and arrest them for us.''
   The officer, who was armed with a revolver and a nightstick,
replied, ``This is my post right here.''
   On Sunday, more than 130 people were arrested as 1,500
demonstrators defied a police ban and marched toward the
Metropolitan Toronto Convention Center, site of the 14th annual
meeting between the seven largest industrialized democracies.

   Ousted President Leslie
Manigat of Haiti called today for international isolation of
Haiti's new military government.
   Manigat, ousted in a military coup Monday and put on a plane to
the Dominican Republic, called the new regime ``very fragile'' and
blamed the coup on corruption in the military.
   Manigat told reporters in Santo Domingo that he has talked to
foreign governments and international organizations asking them to
reject the government named Monday by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the
armed forces chief.
   Manigat, a 57-year-old former political scientist, was elected
in controversial, fraud-marked voting Jan. 17. He said he hasn't
decided where his place of exile will be, but he plans to travel
this month to Europe for meetings with political leaders to rally
opposition to the new government.
   The first he knew of the Namphy coup was as he sat in his home
watching the state television Monday, Manigat said.
   Manigat said he wasn't told where he was being sent until he
landed in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Manigat had rescinded Namphy's order retiring and transferring
military officers last week. He had placed Namphy under house
arrest, but his troops freed him late Sunday and Namphy took the
national palace and announced a new government Monday.

<HEAD>Judge Postpones Simmons Trial in Death of 14 Relatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL SIMMONS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said Tuesday he will postpone
until fall or winter the trial of R. Gene Simmons for the deaths of
14 relatives.
   The trial, which had been set for July 18, follows Simmons'
conviction for the murders of two other people in a rampage last
Christmastime. He has been sentenced to die, but the state Supreme
Court on Monday indefinitely postponed the execution, originally
scheduled June 27.
   ``I think the public has heard enough of R. Gene Simmons for a
while,'' Judge John S. Patterson said in a telephone interview from
Clarksville.
   The high court postponed the execution so that it could consider
whether the Rev. Louis J. Franz of Star City should be allowed to
represent Simmons' interests against Simmons' wishes.
   The court will consider whether the state should have a
mandatory appeal in death sentence cases, or if the court should
review a case in which the appeal is waived.
   The Supreme Court order said written legal arguments on behalf
of Simmons, the state, and Franz should be filed by Monday, with a
hearing set Tuesday.
   One of Simmons' attorneys, John C. Harris of Russellville, said
Simmons would be disappointed by the high court's ruling.
   ``He had his mind made up,'' Harris said. ``He had a court
sentence. He was perfectly willing for it to be carried out. He
didn't want this controversy to go on forever. I don't think anyone
else does except those opposed to capital punishment. I'm
disappointed for him.''
   Simmons, 47, waived his right to appeal after being sentenced to
die for fatally shooting Kathy Kendrick, 24, and James Chaffin, 33,
in Russellville on Dec. 28. He wounded four others during a
45-minute rampage. When Patterson pronounced the death sentence on
May 12, Simmons said he wanted a speedy execution. ``Let the
torture and suffering in me end,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Soldiers Take Refuge at Heavily Fortified Kandahar Airport</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers under attack by
Moslem guerrillas have evacuated Kandahar, Afghanistan's
second-largest city, for the safety of its heavily fortified
airport, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   Insurgents have had Kandahar under siege for a month and say
they have formed an arc around the city, cutting roads on the
north, south and east.
   Those claims were supported by the reports from diplomats, who
said Afghan troops were driven to the city limits and the Red Army,
which is leaving Afghanistan under an agreement signed April 14,
moved its men to the airport.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said travel
on the road to Herat in western Afghanistan was sporadic and many
vehicles came under guerrilla fire.
   Food prices in Kandahar have increased tenfold because of the
siege, they said. The city is about 300 miles south of Kabul, the
capital.
   Earlier reports have said pressure from U.S.-supported
insurgents had forced the Soviets to delay withdrawal from
Kandahar. An occasional battered military truck has been seen
heading west from the city, but there are no reports of significant
Soviet troop movement.
   According to the diplomats, Soviet commanders are limiting use
of their helicopters to avoid losing them to guerrillas armed with
U.S.-made Stinger rockets and other anti-aircraft weapons.
   At least 2,000 Soviet soldiers are said to be at the airport,
which is southeast of the city and has been under guerrilla rocket
fire.
   When the withdrawal agreement was signed in Geneva, more than
100,000 Soviet military personnel were helping Afghanistan's
Communist government fight the 10-year-old insurgency. The pullout
began May 15 and is to be completed within nine months of that date.
   While the siege of Kandahar continues, guerrilla leaders say
they are attacking government garrisons and villages on the
strategic highway from Kandahar to Kabul.
   Western diplomats support insurgent claims that they control
Kalat, capital of Zabul province 150 miles south of Kabul. The
Afghan government denies it.
   Reports say the Afghan air force has pounded guerrilla positions
in Kalat since Sunday and an estimated 300 Afghan soldiers are
holed up in a fort on the outskirts.
   Guerrillas delayed an attack on Ghazni, midway between Kabul and
Kandahar, because residents said they had nowhere to go and refused
to leave their homes, the diplomats said.
   Soviet soldiers withdrew from Ghazni earlier this month. The
road from there to Kabul is said to be closed.
   Diplomats indicated disbelief of some reports about Soviet
withdrwals.
   Although the Afghan government says the Red Army has left
Jalalabad, they said, there are persistent reports of Soviet
soldiers in the city, capital of eastern Nangarhar province.
   A Soviet general said his soldiers had evacuated Logar province
in the east, but the diplomats said reports reached Kabul that
troops were seen last week in Pul-i-Alam, the provincial capital,
and near Mohammad Agha, 50 miles south of the capital.
   Reports from northern Afghanistan said large napalm bombs were
being moved south from Hairatan on the Afghan side of the Oxus
River and truckdrivers who saw them lodged a complaint with U.N.
monitors, the sources reported.
   Weapons supplies from the Soviet Union are not forbidden by the
Geneva pact, which was reached with U.N. mediation. A side
agreement between the Soviet Union and United States, guarantors of
the accord, allows each to supply its allies.
   A Western diplomat said Afghanistan has denied use of the Kabul
airport to the U.N. monitoring team, which is empowered to
investigate complaints by both Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Geneva
agreement is between those two nations.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan's eastern neighbor, is involved because
more than 3 million of the 5.5 million Afghans who have fled their
country live there in border camps and cities. Most of the others
are in Iran, which borders Afghanistan on the west.

<HEAD>Inflation Slows Again, But Drought Effects on Food Prices Expected
Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation slowed for the second month in a row
to an annual rate of 4.2 percent in May, the government said
Tuesday, with the Farm Belt drought yet to reach the grocery
shelves and consumers balking at paying more for clothing.
   Retail prices overall rose just 0.3 percent in May and food
prices were up only 0.4 percent, almost half their 0.7 percent
increase in April, the Labor Department said.
   Last month's increase in the Consumer Price Index, the smallest
since a 0.2 percent rise in February, slowed the pace of inflation
in May from a 5.3 percent annual rate in April and a 6.4 percent
rate in March.
   For the first five months of 1988, overall retail prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace as in 1987.
   ``Where is the inflation bear?'' Sandra Shaber, an analyst for
the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm, said. ``His
footprints are not in much evidence right now.''
   However, Ms. Shaber, like several other economists, warned that
an inflation problem hasn't gone away; it's just hibernating right
now.
   John Hagens, an economist for the Wefa Group of Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said the severe dry weather across much the nation could start
showing up in food prices as early as next month.
   ``Prior to the drought we were looking to food pices for the
year rising about 3.5 percent,'' he said. ``Now we're looking in
the range of 5.5 percent.''
   But, noting that consumers only spend about one-sixth of their
income on food, Hagens predicted the higher grocery prices from the
drought will add only half a percentage point to the overall
inflation rate for the year.
   Higher prices for gasoline and medical costs were behind most of
the inflation in May, but they were somewhat offset by a leveling
off in prices for clothing.
   Women's apparel prices, which had skyrocketed more than 7
percent in March and April, actually fell by 0.4 percent last month.
   ``Their's a lot of stiff consumer resistence out there,'' said
Ms. Shaber. ``Retailers already have put the stuff on sale. That's
just the opposite of the inflation expectations of the 1960s and
'70s.''
   Gasoline prices rose 1.7 percent in May atop a 1.1 percent
increase in April but remained only 2.9 percent above what they
were a year ago.
   Medical costs jumped 0.7 percent in May and are now 6.4 percent
higher than they were a year ago, making them the single biggest
propellant of inflation over the past 12 months.
   The May figures raised the Consumer Price Index to 117.5,
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during
a 1982-84 base period would have cost $117.50 last month, a dime
more than in April.
   In a related report Tuesday, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
fell 0.3 percent in May. The decrease follows an increase of 1.0
percent in April and a drop of 0.6 percent in March.
   The changes left American's inflation-adjusted earnings 0.7
percent below a year ago.
   Hagens said the respite from drought-related higher food prices
could continue another month as ``farmers bring their cattle to
market more quickly because they can't afford to feed them.''
   The resulting lower meat prices, he said, will offset higher
prices for fruits and vegetables, which rose 0.6 percent in May
after a 1.4 percent increase in April.
   Price increases for meats, poultry, fish and eggs also slowed
from a 1.4 percent increase in April to 0.8 percent last month. The
May increases for most other food and beverages were 0.5 percent or
less.
   ``The drought and major hikes in commodity prices that we're
seeing are scary, but it's just too soon for them to have reached
the retail market,'' Ms. Shaber said.
   Donald Ratajczak, an economist who directs his own survey of
wholesale and retail prices from Georgia State University in
Atlanta, said poultry was a key ingredient in higher meat prices
last month.
   ``The poultry producers may be responding to higher feed costs,
but they are the result more of large U.S. soy meal sales to the
Soviet Union last fall than the drought,'' he said.
   About the only place where the drought reached the retail level
was in prices for vegetable oil and mayonnaise. Those prices rose
0.8 percent in May after remaining flat in April, but they account
for a miniscule one-fourth of 1 percent of the CPI.
   Meanwhile, housing costs continued to rise at an annual rate of
3.6 percent in May, the same pace of increase over the past year.
   Prices for new cars rose 0.2 percent last month with the paring
of many dealer incentives but are still on 2 percent above what
they were a year ago.

<HEAD>Spending Cap Forces Bush Campaign to Operate on Tighter Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, forced to
penny-pinch to stay under the federal campaign spending cap, is
operating on a far tighter budget than Democrat Michael Dukakis in
the weeks leading up to the party conventions.
   Bush was only $1.7 million away from the $23 million primary
spending limit as of the beginning of this month, while Dukakis
still had $3.6 million to go before hitting the ceiling, according
to reports their campaigns filed this week with the Federal
Election Commission.
   Bush had more cash on hand, $3 million, than Dukakis, who had $2
million. While the likely Republican candidate cannot spend that
much on campaign activity without exceeding the cap, the law allows
for additional spending on legal and accounting costs, which are
not included in the $23 million limit.
   Jesse Jackson, who has refused to officially concede the
Democratic race to Dukakis despite the Massachusetts governor's
numerical lock on the nomination, has spent only $11 million
against the ceiling.
   He entered this month with $1.2 million in cash on hand, a solid
start toward a warchest to fund his convention activities. Jackson
has a full convention team and is planning a significant operation
involving the platform and rules as well as delegate activity.
   Jackson borrowed $1.5 million in May, which brought his receipts
for the month to more than either Bush or Dukakis. His total was
$3.9 million, including $1.5 million in federal matching funds and
$893,970 in contributions. Jackson also paid back $1.3 million in
loans during the month.
   Dukakis raised $3.5 million _ close to $1 million in matching
funds and $2.3 million in contributions from individuals.
   Bush's fund-raising has come to a virtual standstill because he
can't spend much more even if he raised new money. During May he
took in only $45,834 in contributions and received $289,792 in
federal matching funds.
   Matching funds are provided to presidential candidates who agree
to abide by the spending limits. The taxpayer-supported fund also
foots the entire general election cost, providing $46 million each
to the Republican and Democratic party nominees.
   Bush and Dukakis each have collected enough delegate support to
win their parties' nominations at the summer conventions. The
Democrats meet in Atlanta, July 18-21. The Republicans gather in
New Orleans, Aug. 15-18.
   Bush, however, must keep his operation alive with very little
spending between now and the August convention.
   He has scaled back his traveling and has switched his strategy
to Washington-oriented events and utilization of free news coverage
which he gets by making himself accessible to the national media.
   Bush spent heavily in laying the groundwork at the beginning of
his campaign last year. Since the start of this year, he has spent
$16.2 million, compared to Dukakis' $17.7 million.
   Among the candidates who dropped out of the race, the financial
statements show that Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of Kansas and
television evangelist Pat Robertson each owe more than $1 million
in campaign debts.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., has whittled his down to $111,397 and
former Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. owed $352,648 as of
the end of May, their reports show.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitians ventured back into the
streets today after a military coup catapulted Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy back to power after four months of civilian rule and ended
hopes for democracy.
   Leslie Manigat, the civilian president ousted by Namphy on
Monday, today called the new government ``very fragile'' and blamed
the coup on corruption in the military. He spoke from exile in the
Dominican Republic.
   Some telephone service was restored in Port-au-Prince after
being cut Monday. The streets filled with cars and people in the
morning after being nearly deserted the previous morning.
   Scattered gunfire was heard in the streets overnight and into
the dawn, but there were no signs of factional fighting. Soldiers
have often fired their weapons into the air to frighten civilians
from the street since the coup.
   Manigat told reporters in Santo Domingo that he learned of the
coup as he sat at home watching television Monday night. Manigat
said he still didn't know what role Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who had
been his main military ally, was playing.
   Paul was at Namphy's side Monday when Namphy announced his new
government on national television.
   ``Namphy always acted on his own,'' Manigat said, but he added
that he always had faith in Paul as a loyal military man.
   It was Paul whom Namphy tried to fire last week as commander of
the powerful 700-man Dessalines Batallion. Manigat reversed
Namphy's transfer of Paul and of several other officers and fired
Namphy for insubordination.
   After Monday's takeover, Namphy reappointed Paul commander of
the battalion.
   Manigat said he has talked to foreign governments and
international organizations asking them to reject the Namphy
government. He said he hasn't decided where his place of exile will
be. He said he would travel this month to Europe for meetings with
political leaders to rally support against the new government.
   Manigat said he wasn't told where he was being sent until he
landed in the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Namphy reestablished military rule by decree and named his own
government just hours after rallying troops who seized the national
palace and quickly ousted Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government.
   On Monday, some citizens and officials predicted a bleak future
for the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
   Most businesses and schools in this capital of 1 million people
were closed. There were no reported protests in this arid,
mountainous country of 6 million people.
   ``This means the end of democracy. We are going to have to live
under a military dictatorship,'' a bus driver said hours after
Namphy expelled Manigat.
   ``The army has taken power. This is a government of murderers
and machetes,'' said a former Haitian diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The coup dashed hopes for democracy promised by Namphy after
popular unrest toppled the Duvalier family's 29-year dictatorship.
   The general had led the three-man junta that ruled Haiti after
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled exile in 1986. The junta stepped aside
after Manigat was elected Jan. 17 in fraud-riddled balloting run by
the military and boycotted by most Haitians.
   After the rift last week over Namphy's transfer of military
officers, Manigat placed Namphy under house arrest.
   But loyal soldiers freed Namphy on Sunday and, after brief gun
and grenade battles, Haiti's 7,000-man army united solidly behind
the 55-year-old career soldier. It was not known if there were
casualties in the fighting.
   Neither the Haitian public nor democratic-minded politicians
publicly expressed support for Manigat's government.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said:
``The United States government strongly condemns this serious blow
to hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''
   She noted that Paul was indicted on federal drug-trafficking
charges in Miami last March.
   Namphy announced on national television that he had formed a
military government, named himself president, appointed a 12-member
Cabinet that included only one civilian, and dissolved the National
Assembly.
   He said he would rule by decree.
   He told Haitians that Manigat ``betrayed your confidence and
violated the constitution he swore to uphold.''
   ``The future of democracy was at stake,'' the general said as
the commanders of every unit in Haiti's armed forces watched. ``The
army must protect the superior interests of the country and must
head the country. To this end, a military government has been
formed.''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Academy
Award-winning actress Marlee Matlin were among 10 people who
received Jefferson Awards for public service Tuesday.
   They were honored by the American Institute for Public Service
at an annual ceremony held in the Supreme Court building.
   Koop was unable to attend the ceremony because of a prior
commitment to address the National Parent Teachers Association in
Salt Lake City, Utah.
   His wife, Betty, who accepted the award for him, noted that he
was talking about the disease AIDS.
   The American Institute for Public Service, which awarded Koop
its top honor for work by a public official, praised him for
promoting ``straightforward educational programs to apprise the
public about AIDS.''
   Miss Matlin, who is deaf and won an Oscar for her portrayal of a
young deaf woman in the movie, ``Children of a Lesser God,'' used
sign language to express her appreciation for her award, which was
for public service by someone 35 or under.
   ``I always dreamed of being able to help others as I have been
helped. It's a wonderful world and I'm happy to be part of it,''
she said.
   Also honored were James W. Rouse, a building developer who runs
a foundation in Columbia, Md., that provides affordable housing,
and Father Bruce Ritter of New York City, founder of Covenant House
to help homeless and abused children.
   Rouse was given an award for greatest public service by a
private citizen and Ritter won an award for public service
benefiting the disadvantaged.
   The institute gave awards to the following for public service
benefiting local communities: Joanna and James Chappell, founders
of the Banyon House, a shelter for drug addicts and alcoholics in
West Palm Beach, Fla.; Peter Frazza, a disabled former police
officer who runs the National Disabled Law Officers Association in
Nutley, N.J.; and Lola T. Martin, head of a literacy program in
Hempstead, N.Y.
   Also, J.T. Pace of Mauldin, S.C., who learned to read and write
at 62 and has become a national spokesman for literacy, and Amy
Marie Windom, a high school student in Richmond, Va., who tutors
students and helps run a local chapter of Students Against Drunk
Driving.

   Sure, there's food. And waiters. And they even
take reservations. But that's not the point.
   ``Food is not really what we're serving here,'' said the Rev.
A.B. Short, one of the founders of 458 Cafe. ``What we're serving
is friendship, hospitality, brotherhood and sisterhood.''
   The 458 Cafe opened Monday as a full-service restaurant that
caters to the homeless.
   The cafe, which served 25 people Monday, is in an art deco-style
building downtown. Formerly a drive-in liquor store, it was
purchased with $60,000 in federal grants.
   The homeless sit at white tables in the bright room with pink
flowered curtains and are waited on by volunteers. Some patrons
just shrugged when asked to choose from Monday's menu of beef
burgundy or chicken and rice casserole, salad, green beans or corn
and chocolate cheesecake or peaches.
   Meals are available by reservation only. Reservations are good
for several weeks, during which the staff tries to get to know
patrons and assess their needs beyond food.
   ``We're basically looking to establish some sort of relationship
with people, see what they want to do and what's the next step for
them,'' Short said.
   He wants the restaurant to become a multipurpose resource for
the homeless. He hopes to provide weekly visits by a mobile medical
clinic, legal services and support groups for alcoholics and drug
abusers.
   The restaurant is operated by the Community of Hospitality, a
non-profit religious organization. Food is provided by a food bank.
   One of Monday's patrons said relaxing over hot food and fresh
coffee is a rare pleasure. He can't remember the last time someone
asked him ``May I take your order, please?''
   ``The atmosphere here is a whole lot different (from a soup
kitchen),'' said Oscar Shears, who lives in a shelter. ``It kind of
makes you feel like a person again.''

   A five-member Israeli consular delegation will
visit Moscow in July in the first diplomatic visit from the Jewish
state in 21 years, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a briefing that the delegation
consists of the diplomats, plus a spouse, and that their visas will
permit them to stay in the Soviet Union for two months. They will
visit during the last two weeks in July.
   In Jerusalem, officials said the delegation will administer an
empty embassy building for which Israel has been paying monthly
rent for 21 years.
   Israeli diplomats are hopeful the consular visit to the Soviet
Union could lead to renewed diplomatic relations.
   The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel in 1967 at the time of
the Israeli-Arab war.
   The delegation will work out of the Dutch Embassy, where visas
for Jewish emigrants are processed.

   The chairman of a House panel that handles the
Pentagon budget asserted Tuesday ``there is no member of Congress''
involved in the wide-ranging defense contracting investigation, but
he would not back up the statement.
   Rep. Bill Chappell Jr., D-Fla., told reporters he has not spoken
to official of the Justice Department, the FBI or anyone else
conducting the investigation. Although pressed repeatedly, he would
not cite any authority for his comment.
   News accounts have reported Chappell was under scrutiny in the
investigation. The probe is focused on possible bribery of Pentagon
officials by private consultants, who sought inside information
that would allow their clients to win competitive military
contracts.
   Chappell, chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee, called stories mentioning him ``absolute lies, just a
lot of bunk, as far as I'm concerned.''
   Asked if he thought his telephone has been tapped, Chappell
replied, ``No sir, I do not. There's no reason for it to be
tapped.''
   ``There is no member of Congress, to my knowledge, who is a
target of this investigation _ and I'm a member of Congress,''
Chappell said repeatedly. ``If there's anyone that's involved in
the kind of activities alleged, he should be brought swiftly to
justice.''
   The lawmaker said he and his subcommittee members maintain
regular contact with defense officials and contractors. ``Lots of
people in the contracting business come through our offices,'' he
said.
   Chappell acknowledged he accepts political action committee
contributions from defense contractors, adding, ``I hope they will
keep giving me contributions'' because there's nothing wrong with
receiving them.
   Chappell acknowledged discussing the investigation with longtime
acquaintance William W. Roberts, president of a company in his
district that was searched by FBI agents as part of the probe.
   Chappell said that after reading about the search of Armtec
Inc., in Palatka, Fla., he called Roberts in a light-hearted manner
to learn what happened.
   ``It wasn't a kidding matter to him,'' Chappell said. ``They had
taken all his papers and files. He's cooperating in every way with
the probe.''
   Chappell said he doesn't believe the company is under
investigation, adding that its files were searched to learn
information about individuals under investigation.
   Chappell also denied there was anything improper about his role
in forcing the Army to award a $24.3 million sole-source contract
to Litton Industries for an artillery fire control system the
service didn't want.
   The Washington Times, quoting from Defense Department documents
and sources, said Litton lobbyists used their personal relationship
with Chappell to sell the system.
   ``Congress does a lot of things the Pentagon doesn't want,'' the
congressman said, adding the Army needed the system. Chappell said
he has been trying to get the Army to take the system for a decade,
but the service has ``dragged its feet.''
   The Army preferred to wait for a more advanced system, to be
produced in the 1990s.
   John Thom, a spokesman at Litton headquarters in Beverly Hills,
Calif., said he would have no comment about the role of company
officials.
   ``We sold the Army a darned good system,'' he said.

   Victims of the Kent State University
shootings say they don't trust the state of Ohio, so records of the
1970 incident are moving to Yale University, where they will be
open to the public.
   No new information is expected on the May 4, 1970, shootings by
Ohio National Guardsmen that killed four people and wounded nine
during a campus protest of the Vietnam War, said attorney Steven
Keller.
   Ten boxes of documents and photographs, the first shipment of
about 110 crates, are scheduled to arrive at Yale, in New Haven,
Conn., in the next few weeks. The documents are leaving Ohio at the
request of those wounded and the families of those who died.
   ``Some of the people involved in all this, a lot of them, don't
trust the state of Ohio. ... Ohio might take some of the stuff and
destroy it to destroy some of its unpleasant history,'' said Dean
Kahler, 38, one of the wounded students who is now a county
commissioner in Athens, Ohio.
   The boxes contain reports by the FBI, the Ohio Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation, the Highway Patrol, the
Ohio National Guard, university police and state and local
commissions.
   The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the release of the
information in a 1982 ruling, over the objections of attorneys for
the state. National Guard personnel files and federal grand jury
testimony in the case remain closed.

   Five Ethiopian boys have been granted
political asylum in the United States after stowing away on a ship
to escape their country.
   The boys, ages 12 to 14, said they swam to a U.S.-registered
ship anchored in an Ethiopian port, climbed the anchor chain and
hid aboard the boat. It arrived April 30 in Jacksonville.
   Pimketu Tesfazgi, who has been providing a home for 14-year-old
Fustum Rivei Kiafi, said the boys are uncomfortable speaking to
Americans but are eager to fit in.
   ``They want to be like Americans. They want to learn. They want
to know everything. When they finish their school, they want to
work and buy cars,'' she said.
   Now that the boys have been granted asylum, the foster families
they live with can apply to become legal guardians, said Sandy
Saputo, refugee resettlement specialist for Lutheran Social
Services.
   David Angotti, officer in charge of the Jacksonville branch of
the U.S. Immigration Service, said to be granted asylum the boys
had to show there was a ``clear probability'' that they would be
subjected to persecution if forced to return to Ethiopia.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves $427 Million To Renew Homeless Aid Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee approved
legislation Tuesday authorizing $427 million to renew and expand a
program of aid to the homeless which was approved by Congress last
year.
   The voice-vote approval came after the Democrat-controlled
committee rejected along party lines, 30-19, a proposal by Reps.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., and Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., which would have
channeled homeless aid from a categorical grant program to block
grants.
   Mrs. Roukema argued to no avail that the block grant approach
would give states and cities more leeway in putting the money to
use.
   The panel did approve, however, an amendment by Rep. Joseph J.
DioGuardi, R-N.Y., which would require recipients of homeless-aid
grants to make ``a good faith effort'' to ensure that the housing
facilities they provide are free of illegal drug use and alcohol
abuse.
   When the housing subcommittee took up the bill on June 3,
DioGuardi introduced an amendment which would have required the
recipients to certify that the facility was drug-free. He withdrew
the proposal after Democrats criticized it, but said he would work
on new language.

<TEXT>
   The state won't schedule executions until
the state Supreme Court rules on an issue that could invalidate
Pennsylvania's death penalty law, officials said Tuesday.
   ``It is clear to us that that issue will have to be resolved
before there is an execution in Pennsylvania,'' said Christopher A.
Lewis, the Casey administration's executive deputy general counsel.
   At issue is whether the death penalty statute provides a method
for executions. Lawyers for Roderick Frey of Lancaster, who was
scheduled to die in the electric chair June 14, argued that no
method is called for, so the law is unconstitutional.
   The court, in blocking Frey's execution, agreed to hear
arguments in September.
   Frey, convicted of arranging the 1979 contract killing of his
wife, Barbara Jean, was the subject of Gov. Robert P. Casey's first
execution warrant. A ruling in Frey's favor could overturn his
death sentence, as well as those of 83 other death row prisoners.
   ``It's a broad-based challenge. It reaches everybody on death
row in Pennsylvania,'' said Barry Steinhardt, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties Union's Pennsylvania chapter. The
ACLU's lawyers help represent Frey.
   The electric chair, at the State Correctional Institution at
Rockview, has not been used since 1962.
   A 1913 law established the state's method of execution. It also
provided that if any section of the law was deemed
unconstitutional, the entire act would be void.
   The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled the death penalty
unconstitutional because many states had what amounted to a
mandatory death sentence for first-degree murder. The court allowed
states to reinstate the death penalty in 1976.
   A new state law was enacted in 1978, but instead of restating
the method of execution, it relied on the 1913 law.

   National Public Radio announced Tuesday a $1.5
million grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation, the largest single private-sector grant in NPR's
history.
   The grant will ``enhance NPR's ability to create new services,
search for better ways to do what we do, and serve better a
national audience growing in numbers,'' said Douglas J. Bennet,
president of the non-profit radio network.
   About 30 percent of NPR's operating revenues comes from grants
and program underwriting, with the rest generated by its 350 member
stations.
   John E. Corbally, president of the MacArthur Foundation, praised
NPR's ``admirable track record for sound management. The foundation
felt that the time was right for long-term, unrestricted support
for innovation on NPR.''
   Since 1978, the foundation has awarded more than $550 million in
grants to various organizations for programs in mental health,
tropical medicine, conservation, education, peace and international
cooperation.

   A powerful bomb believed planted by Sikh
militants exploded today in a crowded Hindu market near the Golden
Temple and killed at least 24 people, police said.
   The United News of India news agency quoted unofficial sources
as saying that more than 30 people were killed and 75 others
wounded. Police refused comment on the report.
   At least 45 people were reported injured earlier. Suresh Arora,
senior police superintendent in Amritsar, said some of them died in
hospitals. He said the dead included two Sikh policemen.
   Officials clamped an indefinite curfew on the old walled city of
Amritsar after the explosion.
   About 300 people were in the market frequented by cloth
merchants, yarn sellers and Hindu industrialists when the explosion
occurred, witnesses said.
   Angry people prevented police from coming to the spot about 200
yards from the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine.
   It was the fourth attack since Sunday blamed on Sikh militants.
At least 43 people have died in the latest violence, and most of
the victims have been Hindus.
   Late Monday, at least six people were killed in neighboring
Haryana state when gunmen believed to be Sikh extremists opened
fire at a crowd of people leaving a movie theater.
   In Amritsar, protesters pelted police vehicles with stones and
blocked them from going to the explosion site, witnesses said.
   Two policemen were injured in the scuffle, according to Arora.
   Dina Nath, one of the people injured in the blast, said the
explosive was hidden inside a motor scooter parked in the shopping
area.
   Police said they were investigating.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab state for six years.
   The Press Trust of India said four Sikhs fired submachine guns
into a crowd of people leaving a movie theater in the Haryana town
of Pehowa on Monday. The militants escaped, the news agency said.
   Pehowa is about 20 miles west of the town of Kurukshetra, where
18 people were killed and 33 injured in a bomb explosion in a
market on Sunday.
   Police said they believed Sikh militants planted the bomb,
believed to have been a remote-controlled device.
   In New Delhi, at least four people were killed and 40 wounded
Monday when militants hurled a homemade grenade into an outdoor
vegetable market.
   No arrests have been reported in any of the incidents.
Authorities have ordered police to be on full alert in six north
Indian states and in New Delhi.
   At least 52 people have been killed this year in violence blamed
on Sikh militants outside of Punjab, a northern state.
   In Punjab, the militants have been blamed for the killings of
more than 1,330 people since the start of the year.
   Sikhs make up just 2 percent of India's 800 million people but
comprise a slight majority in Punjab.
   The militants claim discrimination by India's majority Hindus.

   A bomb blamed on Sikh extremists exploded
in a crowded Hindu cloth market near the Golden Temple on Tuesday
evening, killing 24 people, a police official said.
   The latest bombing was the fourth attack attributed to Sikh
separatists since Sunday. At least 52 people, most of them Hindus,
have died in the attacks and more than 130 have been wounded.
   Crowds of Hindus angered by continuing Sikh militant violence in
Punjab state threw stones at police as they tried to cordon off the
area struck by the bomb. Doctors said they had problems operating
because of agitated crowds that filled the hospitals, where about
three dozen of the injured were taken.
   The blast ignited a fire that burned two shops in the market and
10 motor scooters. Merchant Tilak Raj said the flames engulfed many
people who were trying to flee the scene.
   Most of the blast's victims were Hindus.
   Suresh Arora, the city's senior police superintendent, called
the situation ``very tense'' and officials clamped a curfew in the
area.
   Arora said the dead included two policemen. Both were
clean-shaven Sikhs.
   The bomb was hidden inside a plastic bag in the front part of a
motor scooter parked at the market, Arora quoted witnesses as
saying.
   Hindu merchants, industrialists and cloth retailers gather at
the wholesale market, which is about 200 yards from the Golden
Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine. Security forces last month
besieged the temple to flush out Sikh militants there.
   Serbjeet Singh, deputy commissioner of Amritsar, blamed
neighboring Pakistan for the bombing. He said he expected more
attacks in Punjab state by ``Pakistani agents.''
   India blames rival Pakistan for causing trouble in Punjab by
training and sheltering Sikh extremists. Pakistan denies the charge.
   Bundles of woolen shawls, cloth and bags lay strewn around the
market after the explosion. Sweets from a nearby shop were
scattered on the dusty, blood-spattered road.
   On Monday, Sikh militants hurled a grenade into an outdoor
vegetable market in New Delhi, killing four Hindus and injuring 40
others. In neighboring Haryana state, Sikh gunmen opened fire at a
crowd leaving a movie theater Monday night and killed six people.
   Eighteen people were killed and 33 injured in a bomb blast
Sunday in Kurukshetra, also in Haryana.
   Sikh extremists have been fighting for a separate homeland in
Punjab for the past six years, claiming discrimination by the
majority Hindus. Their bloody campaign has targeted mainly Hindus
or moderate Sikhs.
   No arrests have yet been reported in the latest attacks. Police
were placed on alert in six north Indian states and in New Delhi.
   At least 52 people have been slain this year in violence blamed
on Sikhs militants outside the state of Punjab.
   At least 1,357 people have been killed in Punjab this year by
suspected Sikh extremists.
   Sikhs are 2 percent of India's 800 million people but they are a
majority in Punjab.

   Leaders of the seven industrialized democracies
agreed Tuesday to hold a summit again next year, in France, at the
height of the spectacular celebrations that President Francois
Mitterrand is producing for the bicentennial of the launching of
the French Revolution.
   As they closed the 14th annual summit of the world's economic
powers after three days of talks, the leaders said the
get-togethers have been good for their own countries and for the
rest of the world.
   ``The economic summits have helped to sustain the values of
democracy that underlie our economic and political systems,'' said
a draft of the final communique.
   It said the meetings have given the leaders a chance ``to
reflect, in an informal and flexible manner, upon their common
responsiblity for the progress of the world economy and to resolve
how that responsibility should have practical manifestation in the
years ahead.''
   The Toronto summit concluded the second ''cycle'' in which each
of the seven countries in turn acted as host to its peers.
   Next year's three-day gathering in Paris _ starting on Bastille
Day, July 14, the national holiday _ will be the start of another
round of seven meetings running through 1995.
   ``We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefitted both our own countries and the wider world
community,'' the leaders said. ``We believe, too, that the
opportunities afforded by our meetings are becoming even more
valuable in today's world of increasing inter-dependence and
increasing technological change.''
   The tradition of economic summits was started in 1975, when
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing invited his counterparts
from the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany and Italy to
the Renaissance chateau of Rambouillet southwest of Paris for some
informal talks out of the glare of the spotlights.
   In succeeding years, the Canadian prime minister and the
president of the European Economic Community were added to the
annual talks. The discussions have become more tightly structured,
with officials working months in advance on the final communique,
and have attracted ever-increasing platoons of journalists _ some
3,000 of them in Toronto.
   Next year's meeting will be the third in France, and the second
with Mitterrand as host. In 1982, his second year in office, he
staged the summit in the chateau of Versailles, with its atmosphere
of glittering elegance from the days when Louis XIV reigned there
three centuries ago.
   Bicentennial preparations have been under way for years, and
have been a preoccupation of Mitterrand's since his 1981 election.
His re-election last month to a second seven-year term gives him a
chance to preside over the celebrations.
   In his first term, Mitterrand launched such projects as a new
Opera House, renovation of the Louvre museum and construction of a
huge arch in the form of a cube at the western gates of Paris _ all
to be completed in time for the anniversary of the July 14, 1789,
seizing of the Bastille prison which launched the revolution.
   The approach of the bicentennial has sparked a debate in France
over who is the true heir of the revolution's spirit _ the
conservatives with their devotion to individual liberties, or the
leftists _ like Mitterrand _ with their challenge to entrenched
privilege and to the rich.
   Adding the summit to the menu of concerts, historical
reproductions and giant fireworks displays will give the French a
chance to speculate about what such revolutionaries as Danton and
Robespierre might have thought about the gathering of the world's
richest nations.
   While both previous French summits have been held in chateau
settings reminiscent of the nation's Renaissance grandeur, a likely
candidate for next year's meeting is the shiny new
commercial-residential complex of La Defense at the western edge of
the capital, a symbol of a new France of high technology and rapid
modernization.
   Two miles west of the Arc de Triomphe, La Defense is the 20th
century prolongation to the famed east-west axis in Paris, leading
from the Louvre through the Place de la Concorde and along the
Champs-Elysee.
   A showcase of architectural fantasies, the complex houses more
than 300 companies where some 60,000 people work. Nearly 40,000
live in the residential secion.
   Spread over nearly 2,470 acres on a bluff, La Defense is crowned
by a gigantic ultra-modern cube-shaped arch now under construction,
which will be an office building. The design by Danish architect
Otto Van Sprecklsen was chosen personally by Mitterrand.
   La Defense takes its name from a monument on the site
commemorating the defense of Paris in 1871 when the French held off
the Germans in the Franco-Prussian war.
   The complex is a five-minute ride from central Paris on the RER,
a network of suburban express trains linked to the Paris Metro.

   Drought aid is needed urgently in the nation's
breadbasket, which has been transformed into ``a brown and brittle
land'' as a result of $1.8 billion in crop damage, a Senate
chairman said Tuesday.
   ``This drought comes at a time when many farmers are just
climbing out of the hole after five years of farm depression,''
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said
``But now, with their crops burned and their livestock hungry, they
are once again threatened with bankruptcy.''
   Leahy said that a weekend inspection tour by six senators into
Montana and the Dakotas found ``a brown and brittle land.''
   ``These three states, along with Minnesota, are suffering
through the worst drought this early in the season that has
occurred in my lifetime,'' Leahy said. ``Estimated crop losses in
these states alone are running in excess of $1.8 billion, and
that's a conservative estimate that goes higher every day.''
   He said a drought task force meeting Wednesday should stay in
session until consensus has bee reached on what kind of aid package
to recommend.
   The bipartisan task force of lawmakers and administration
officials was formed last week to monitor crop damage arising from
the broiling sun and shortage of rainfall that has wrung out the
Farm Belt over the last month.
   Any hope of winning approval of drought relief depends on
keeping the issue bipartisan and avoiding friction with the
administration, Leahy said. He praised Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng for opening conservation lands to hay cutting and
cattle grazing. But Leahy said more aid would be needed.
   Lyng told lawmakers last week to be prepared to move with
drought relief legislation but urged them not to make anything
final until the seriousness of the problem was fully known. Leahy
said, however, that it was not too soon to get started with a bill.
   ``You've got to be giving some help to these people, to say hang
on,'' Leahy told reporters. ``At what point do they sit around the
kitchen table and start to say, `I can't take it anymore.' I don't
want that to happen.''
   He said many afflicted farmers ``have just come through five
years of living hell.''
   ``What I saw was not a disaster in the making,'' Leahy said.
``What I saw was a disaster now.''
   Even if the task force reaches a consensus this week on the
shape of an aid package, it most likely would take weeks or longer
to get the bill to President Reagan's desk.
   In response to a question, he scoffed at the notion that
congressional enthusiasm for the issue may be sparked largely by
election-year pressures.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee balked on Monday at a
proposal to guarantee 92 percent of federal income-support payments
to wheat, feed grains, upland cotton and rice producers whose crops
are wiped out by the drought.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., proposed the measure, saying the
situation in his state already was grim. But other panel members
said it still was too early to act and that his proposal would have
provided no aid to producers of crops not covered by USDA programs.
   In the end, the panel did not vote on the proposal and instead
voted to attach a ``sense of Congress'' resolution calling for
drought aid in a $47.3 billion agriculture appropriation bill for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

   A former Pentagon investigator said Tuesday
the Justice Department had ``substantive evidence that there was
massive fraud'' in military weapons purchases three years ago but
failed to pursue the case.
   ``We had extensive evidence that other companies were involved''
beyond the few that were charged, Robert L. Segal said at a Capitol
Hill news conference.
   Segal's scheduled testimony to a Senate subcommittee on Oct. 1,
1985, was blocked by the Justice Department because it allegedly
would have harmed ongoing criminal cases.
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the subcommittee chairman at the
time, has contended this week that the current Pentagon bribery
probe could have been conducted three years ago.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, at a news conference Monday,
defended the Justice Department against Grassley's charges. ``I can
assure you that at no time has this department had to be dragged
into any indictment where the evidence is there,'' Meese said.
   Segal said that before resigning from the government in January
1985 he had worked 11 years for the Drug Enforcement Administration
for 11 years and for one year for the Defense Department, where he
served as the Pentagon's liaison with the Procurement Fraud Unit in
the Justice Department.
   Segal, now a stockbroker in suburban Springfield, Va., said his
decision to leave government work ``has nothing to do with this
case.''
   He described as himself as frustrated because he said there was
``a terrible lack of competence'' at the fraud unit. ``They
literally were not prepared to handle'' an involved case, he said.
   Asked to estimate the extent of bribery and fraud in Pentagon
procurement, Segal answered, ``I think it's common.''
   He made clear that he doesn't believe that the investigations
were blocked for political reasons, a view shared by Grassley.
   ``What happened has nothing to do with the administration,''
said Segal. ``It's not the administration we're talking about here,
it's the bureaucracy.''
   Grassley said, ``It's the bureaucracy that's at fault, it's not
the administration. This has been a problem of both Democratic and
Republican administrations.''
   Segal said he suggested in 1985 that defense officials and
consultants who passed classified documents should be charged with
espionage. While he said the charge could later be lowered,
``espionage is a leverage item'' in trying to plea-bargain with
people in an investigation.
   Segal said he saw cases involving the alleged unauthorized
taking of hundreds of pages of classified documents. But said ``no
one seemed concerned about the fact that classified information was
being sold, being bandied about.''
   In a related development Tuesday, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said
the congressional General Accounting Office estimates that while
the Pentagon says it spent $155 million on consultants in fiscal
1987, the actual cost was $2.8 billion.
   And that figure, high as it is, may be far too low, Pryor said.
He said the GAO estimated that consulting costs might run as high
as $18 billion a year.
   Pryor said the Pentagon ``has been using a very narrow
definition, obviously'' of how to define a consultant's contract.

   Once again, Eugene Lang has rewritten
Shakespeare for a class of Harlem sixth-graders: to study,
perchance to dream.
   Seventy-seven graduates of Public School 92 entertained visions
of college Tuesday after hearing that their tuition is guaranteed
under Lang's ``I Have A Dream'' program for inner-city youths _
provided, of course, they graduate high school.
   ``It means a lot to me,'' said 12-year-old Paul Getty after
hearing the surprise announcement during graduation ceremonies in
the school auditorium. ``To get a job, you need a college
education. I feel great.''
   Feeling just as good was Lang, who helped arrange the program
which will be funded by the Marble Collegiate Church of Manhattan.
The church, through donations by its 3,500 members, has raised
$270,000.
   ``If you work for it, if you stay in school, if you graduate
high school, you will have no worries,'' Lang promised the
students. ``Your college tuition will be paid.''
   Lang founded the program seven years ago; it now provides the
promise of a college education to approximately 10,000 students in
25 cities around the country. Half the students in Lang's first
group entered college in September 1987.
   Two other Manhattan schools will be designated for the program
later this week.
   Both of those schools will be similar to P.S. 92, which sits
amid a row of burned-out and boarded-up buildings, its playground
littered with bottles and other garbage. But it's what's inside the
schools that counts, program directors say.
   ``I have never seen so much potential waiting to be tapped in
one room,'' said Gloria Caliandro of Marble Collegiate as the
students gave a standing ovation to her and husband Arthur
Caliandro, the church's senior minister.
   Virtually all the graduating boys and girls were shocked and
excited at the prospect of a fully paid college career. Dwayne
Cooper, a 12-year-old aspiring architect, vowed to study hard next
year.
   ``I think it's good to get this chance,'' he said. ``I always
wanted to go to college.''
   Agreed classmate Khaaliq Muhammad: ``It means a great chance to
be somebody. I'm very happy.''

<HEAD>Half Of US School Children Are Free Of Tooth Decay, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Half of America's 43 million school-age
children have never experienced tooth decay, a dental problem that
affected almost all of America's youth just a generation ago,
according to a federal study released Tuesday.
   In a study that included the oral examination of about 40,000
youngsters coast-to-coast, the National Institute of Dental
Research found that dental cavities have declined by 36 percent
among children ages 5 to 17, and that 49.9 percent of these
children had no tooth decay at all.
   Officials said the sample population examined was selected to
represent the approximately 43 million school-aged children in the
nation.
   Dr. James P. Carlos, chief of the epidemiology at the NIDR, said
that dental decay, a problem that has plagued humankind throughout
history, has been steadily declining since the use of fluoride
became widespread and that the trend probably will continue.
   ``This disease, which is probably the most chronic disease of
childhood, is being decreased very fast,'' said Carlos. ``It is
declining 35 to 36 percent every seven years and now half of the
children in the country have never even experienced dental decay.''
   Carlos said the decline in tooth decay follows a pattern
consistent with the increased use of fluoride in the nation's
drinking water, in toothpastes, and in mouth washes.
   He said the increased use of a dental sealant also has affected
the decline in tooth decay. The sealant is a plastic material that
dentists paint on the chewing surfaces to protect teeth from decay.
   For the survey, specialists counted the amount of decay or
fillings noted on each of the 128 surfaces of a typical set of 28
teeth in the school children. A missing tooth was counted as five
surfaces. Wisdom teeth were not counted since few school children
have them.
   The result showed that the statistical mean of tooth surfaces
with decay was 3.07 per child. The mean in a survey taken in 1980
was 4.77, reflecting a 36 percent decline in tooth cavities.
   In 1980, the survey found that 36.6 percent of the children were
free of tooth decay. This compares to almost half, 49.9 percent,
found without decay in the recent survey.
   Carlos said no similar surveys were taken prior to the 1980
finding, but experts estimate that the only 28 percent of the
school children in the 1970s were without tooth decay, and that a
generation earlier virtually every child experienced some tooth
decay between age 5 and 17.
   He said in the 1940s, it was estimated that U.S. school children
averaged seven teeth each that were decayed, missing or filled.
   Now, instead of counting teeth, he said, the survey must count
surfaces affected in order to get a meaningful statistic.
   Carlos said school children in the Southwest, which includes
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado, showed the least amount of
tooth decay with a mean of 2.4 tooth surfaces affected per child.
That region showed a mean of 3.4 in 1980.
   The New England states _ Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island _ showed the highest
rate, with an mean of 3.6, compared to a mean of 6.1 in 1980.
   Other regional findings, with the mean number of tooth surfaces
per child affected and the same mean from the 1980 survey in
parenthesis, are:
   Northeast (New York, Pennsylania, New Jersey): 3.4 (5.4).
   Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Missouri,
Illionis, Indiana, Ohio): 2.9 (4.7).
   Southeast (Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana): 3.1 (4.6).
   Pacific (Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and California): 3.4
(5.1).
   Northwest (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah): 2.8 (4.4).
   Carlos said the reason for the regional difference ``has never
been satisfactorily explained and is one of the enduring mysteries
of dental epidemiology.''
   At one time, he said experts thought that the varying amounts of
fluoride in the drinking water of the national regions accounted
for the differences, but that has now been discounted because
fluoride is presence in about 60 percent of the water systems in
the nation.
   Dr. Preston A. Littleton Jr., deputy director of NIDR, said the
decline in childhood dental decay will make it possible for the
agency to concentrate more of its research efforts toward dental
problems experienced among adults and older Americans.
   ``The results give us the opportunity to redeploy efforts and
attempt to make similar gains among the older population,'' said
Littleton.

   Both were governors of medium-sized states.
Both sprang to national prominence still strangers to many voters.
Both were Washington outsiders. Both lacked foreign policy
experience.
   The similarities generally end there between Michael Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, and Jimmy Carter, the
last Democratic president who was voted out of office.
   But Republican George Bush, who will face Dukakis in the fall as
the Republican nominee, would love to make the comparison stick in
the minds of voters: Dukakis as an unsmiling Jimmy Carter.
   Whether the similarities run beyond the superficial, and whether
they reveal anything about what kind of president Dukakis would be,
is open to question.
   ``He has similar gaps that I had _ he had never served in
Washington and so forth,'' Carter said this week as he worked on a
Philadelphia housing project for low-income residents.
   But the former president took offense at Bush's campaign tactics.
   ``He's run kind of a silly campaign so far, making personal
attacks on Dukakis already and trying to compare Dukakis with me
and things of that kind which I think is counterproductive foWe will not
abandon the land because murderers want it,''
Shamir said at Givat Ada, a communal farm in northern Israel where
Eli Cohen was buried.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, a 10-year-old boy was
shot by an Israeli civilian who opened fire to disperse a
stone-throwing mob, said officials at the city's Al Ittihad
Hospital.
   The civilian was injured when his car was stoned, but other
details were not available, said an army spokesman.
   In the nearby village of Burka, soldiers opened fire against
youths who set up roadblocks, then threw stones at troops, the
spokesman said. He added that one youth was wounded.
   The 10-year-old was shot in the right leg and the victim in
Burka was a 16-year-old with a bullet wound in the left shoulder,
hospital officials said. Neither was seriously hurt.
   In the Shati refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers
opened fire to disperse demonstrators, wounding a 25-year-old Arab
in the chest, said doctors at Gaza City's Ahli Arab Hospital. The
army said it had no report of the incident.
   Israel radio said thousands of Israelis gathered for the funeral
of Cohen, the farmer whose stabbed and battered body was found
Monday amid his grape vines in Moshav Shekef, a communal farm near
the West Bank.
   Shamir, whose remarks were carried by the radio and the Israeli
Itim news agency, called on the mourners to build a ``fortified,
strengthened Israel.''
   ``If the killers, their dispatchers, their commanders mean to
tell us it is either us or them, then our answer is clear: This is
our land of Israel,'' Shamir said.
   ``If it's our fate to fight for our lives, we will be here and
not them,'' he said. ``We will harden our will not to surrender.''
   Several mourners shouted, ``Death to the terrorists.''
   Cohen's coffin was draped in an Israeli flag. He was buried in
Givat Ada, a farming village in northern Israel where he once
lived. Moshav Shekef where he died is 25 miles south of Jerusalem.
   Cohen, 33, was the fourth Israeli killed since the Arab uprising
began last December. At least 210 Palestinians have been killed.
   The slaying of Cohen, who left a pregnant wife and two children,
has raised calls for tougher action to quell the revolt against
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Raphael Eitan, a right-wing member of parliament and former army
chief of staff, was quoted by Itim as saying only mass deportations
could halt the intefadeh.
   ``We should expel immediately 50 heads of families to Lebanon
wherever there is a disturbance and it doesn't matter who was
involved in the disturbance,'' Eitan said. ``If it's an uprising of
the people, it must be dealt with collectively.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an interview with The
Associated Press that Cohen's death proved the correctness of the
government policy of encouraging civilians to carry arms and to
fire in self defense.
   ``I am really sorry the farmer who was attacked and viciously
killed did not have the weapon that we would have hoped he would,''
Rabin said. ``I believe the whole results would be entirely
different. He would be alive today.''
   The English-language Jerusalem Post said Cohen's murder ``marks
a significant escalation in the intefadeh'' because the slaying was
inside Israel, not in the territories captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``The intefadeh is moving slowly but steadily into Israel,'' the
daily said.
   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israeli soldiers were seen sealing
Palestinian shops in downtown Gaza City where two soldiers were
injured by a firebomb Monday night.
   An Arab witness said by telephone that troops welded shut the
doors of five shops, then took the equipment to the next street. He
said he could not see if the troops were closing other shops
because he could not leave his house under curfew orders.
   A military spokesman said he was unaware of the sealing of
shops, but confirmed a curfew was in effect in downtown Gaza City.

   A Union Carbide Corp. representative
said Tuesday that the company would negotiate with private lawyers
for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   ``We will settle with individuals. They all have their own
lawyers,'' said the representative, an American lawyer, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   About 523,000 people have filed claims in the Bhopal District
Court in the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Nearly 3,000 people died and 20,000 were seriously injured when
methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide subsidiary's
plant in Bhopal in December 1984.
   India filed a $3 billion compensation suit against the Danbury,
Conn.-based multinational but the case still is at pre-trial stage.
   The Indian government also passed a law making it the sole legal
representative of the victims.
   When asked if the settlement with the victims would be legal in
view of the law, the Union Carbide representative said: ``The case
can be settled in the United States. There is no law to prevent
that.''
   But H.K. Khan, secretary of India's Chemicals and Petrochemicals
ministry, said Union Carbide could not settle directly with the
victims in the United States.
   He said the company submitted itself to Indian law and is
``bound by the law.''
   The government last week requested the Bhopal court to issue an
injunction blocking Union Carbide from such a move.
   Judge M.W. Deo is to rule on the application July 29.
   The Union Carbide representative said it was waiting for the
Indian government to provide the company with the exact number of
``real victims.''
   Khan said the government lawyers will provide the list of real
victims to the court the court begins hearing individual cases.
   ``We are under no obligation to provide the list to Union
Carbide,'' he said.
   Khan said the Indian government ``had to go back to court
because there was no proper offer forthcoming from Carbide'' for an
out-of-court settlement. He refused to discuss figures.
   Sources close to Union Carbide said in November 1987 that the
company was willing to pay $650 million in an out-of-court
settlement but the Indian government was pressing for more.

   Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature on Tuesday asked
that the southern territory be made independent until Moscow
decides whether it belongs to Soviet Armenia or Azerbaijan, reports
from the area said.
   Most of 160,000 people in Nagorno-Karabakh are ethnic Armenians,
a mainly Christian ethnic group, but it was assigned in 1923 to the
predominantly Moslem neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   The legislature voted Feb. 20 to request annexation to Armenia
and the Armenian legislature supported it, but Azerbaijan has
refused to give up the territory and Moscow has not said whether it
will decide the question.
   On Tuesday, the Nagorno-Karabakh legislators appealed to the
federal Supreme Soviet for temporary independence, according to
Koryun Nahabidyan, an Armenian activist in Moscow who spoke to
Nagorno-Karabakh residents familiar with the decision.
   Nahabidyan, who has led several Armenian demonstrations in
Moscow, said the legislature asked for independence until the
Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, decided whether
Nagorno-Karabakh would remain part of Azerbaijan or be given to
Armenia.
   A resident of Stepanakert, the territorial capital, said the
``whole city'' of 60,000 people gathered outside government
buildings to await the legislature's decision. The resident,
speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity, said the members
rejected a proposal to secede from Azerbaijan.
   He said the legislature appealed to residents who have been
striking since May 23 to return to their jobs, then added without
elaboration: ``People won't return to work because the session was
unclear. Some of the deputies said things people won't like.''
   Reports have said the strike has stopped nearly all commercial
activity in the region except for retailing and agriculture.
   The activist in Moscow, Nahabidyan, said the territorial
legislature asked the Supreme Soviet to disregard Friday's decision
by the Azerbaijan legislature to oppose a transfer to Armenia.
   It also asked the national Supreme Court to take over legal
action against rioters responsible for killing 32 people, most of
them Armenians, on Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijan city of Sumgait.
   Armenians have said the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan, which is
handling the case, is not being severe enough on those responsible.
   In the latest case of ethnic violence, officials reported eight
Armenians and eight Azerbaijanis injured Friday and Saturday in the
Armenian villages of Masis and Sayat Nova.

   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas and
Syrian-backed Palestinian rivals battled in Beirut's Chatilla and
Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camps Tuesday in a bloody power struggle.
Police said 12 people were killed and 45 wounded.
   The casualties raised the toll since fighting began 12 days ago
to 46 killed and 188 wounded.
   Police said machine gun fire forced the closing of the road next
to Bourj el-Barajneh, which leads to the Beirut airport. Flight
operations were not affected, police said.
   Shell blasts echoed across Beirut as Arafat's Fatah fighters,
the main component of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and
Col. Saeed Mousa's Fatah-Uprising guerrillas pounded each other's
positions with mortar and rocket barrages.
   A Fatah spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mousa's fighters deployed outside the camps launched two assaults
on Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh around noon. He said both attacks
were repulsed by Arafat supporters.
   Police said Mousa's gunners, deployed in Syrian-controlled
territory in mountains overlooking Beirut, hammered both camps with
155mm howitzers.
   Mousa's fighters also battered the shantytowns with 82mm and
120mm mortars from positions in Syrian-controlled neighborhoods
around the camps.
   Fatah guerrillas responded with 120mm mortar fire, police said.
   Fatah-Uprising said it foiled an attempt by Arafat's men to
storm one of their outposts on the outskirts of Bourj el-Barajneh
in the afternoon.
   Police said two mortar rounds exploded in residential
neighborhoods around Chatilla, killing four civilians and wounding
18.
   They said one 155mm artillery shell crashed into a densely
populated district near Bourj el-Barajneh, wounding three people.
   Fatah accused Mousa's gunners of shelling the camps
``indiscriminately after their repeated failure to achieve any
military victory on the ground.''
   The camps have been the scene of some of the worst violence in
Beirut since 1982, when Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of
people in Chatilla and nearby Sabra.
   The camps, shelled and besieged by Israel's invading army that
year, were later battered by Syrian-backed Shiite Moslems for more
than two years. Thousands of people were killed or wounded in those
battles.
   Now Palestinian is fighting Palestinian.
   Tuesday's fighting raged despite efforts by Libyan mediators and
other Palestinian factions to arrange a cease-fire.
   Arafat's loyalists had dislodged Mousa's guerrillas from the two
camps in earlier fighting.
   But the latter regrouped in Syrian-policed areas of west Beirut
and the city's southern slums and have launched a series of
abortive attacks to regain territory they lost in the shantytowns.
   Mousa broke away from the PLO in 1983 with other Syrian-backed
radical factions in a dipsute over Arafat's policies. They set up
their headquarters in Damascus, Syria's capital.
   Fatah and Mousa's group have been fighting in the camps despite
a reconciliation between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus in April that was aimed at ending their 5-year-old feud
over who would control the Palestinian movement.

<HEAD>S&Ls Still Awash in Red Ink Despite Some Hopeful Signs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's savings and loan industry continued to
bleed huge amounts of red ink in the first three months of this
year as the deterioration of the worst S&Ls overwhelmed a modest
improvement at solvent institutions, the government said Tuesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the 3,118 federally
insured S&Ls lost $3.78 billion, only slightly below the $3.81
billion record set in the last three months of 1987.
   Bank board economist James Barth said the losses continued to
pile up despite some hopeful signs.
   Earnings at thrifts considered solvent under regulatory rules
totaled $600 million, compared with a $200 million loss in the
fourth quarter of 1987.
   Also, the percentage of solvent institutions increased from 65
percent to 69 percent. And, the number of insolvent S&Ls under
generally accepted accounting rules fell for the first time in two
years from 518 to 504.
   ``Unfortunately, we do have a bifurcated industry,'' Barth said.
``The insolvents got worse, although solvents did indeed realize
gains.''
   In the January-March period, 2,164 institutions earned $1.3
billion, but 954 lost $5.1 billion. The 20 worst S&Ls accounted for
$3 billion of the losses and the worst 50 accounted for $3.7
billion.
   Texas, where 133 of 279 S&Ls are considered insolvent, racked up
losses of $3.48 billion. Institutions in Texas, along with the
other oil-drilling states of Louisiana and Oklahoma, have been
particularly hard-pressed by the plunge in oil and regional real
estate prices.
   Last year, the thrift industry had its worst year since the
Great Depression, losing $7.6 billion. That figure, released
Tuesday, is an upward revision from previous estimates of $6.8
billion.
   Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of
Savings Institutions, said 1988 losses will likely top $8 billion
and set another record.
   However, he said, ``there are a lot of things in these numbers
to suggest that while the problem is terrible, it is not getting
worse. It is bottoming out somewhat. I don't mean to put a
favorable light on a $3.8 billion loss, but there are some glimmers
out there.''
   By comparison, the nation's 13,541 commercial banks earned $3.6
billion in 1987, the smallest profit since the Depression, and $5.0
billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   While banks' performance is improving, S&Ls have not gotten
better yet despite regulators' efforts to shut down or bail out
sick S&Ls. Twelve were closed or merged with healthier institutions
from January through March.
   The bank board said earlier this month that the industry's
capital, which closely mirrors losses, declined about another $550
million in April.
   However, Barth said preliminary data from April indicates the
industry as a whole could turn an operating profit in the second
quarter.
   The question is how many more bad loans are out there, but
unrecognized on S&Ls' books. Loan losses accounted for $3.9 billion
of the first quarter loss versus $4.0 billion the previous quarter.
   ``Hopefully, most of the write-downs have been accounted for ...
and that would indicate losses will taper off,'' Barth said.
   But some private analysts say there are likely billions more in
losses yet to be booked. And they say rising interest rates could
cut into the operating profits of healthy thrifts.
   ``The reason losses continue to mount, is they already exist.
It's just a matter of recognizing them,'' said Richard L. Peterson,
professor of finance at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
   ``A lot of people would say that losses in the industry total
$55 billion. We're still a long way from recognizing that, plus
there is some risk of short-term interest rates going up and losses
increasing,'' he said.
   The scope of the industry's losses is becoming increasingly
critical as regulators and Congress try to determine how long the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures savings
deposits of $100,000 or less, can continue operating without an
infusion of more money.
   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall said the $20 billion the FSLIC
will have over the next three years is as much as the agency can
reasonably spend and it is too soon to tell if more will be needed
later.
   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing
agency, estimates it will cost $26 billion to $36 billion to
resolve the cases of the more than 500 insolvent institutions.
Private analysts put the price tag at $50 billion or more.

Base</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military said Tuesday it captured
a communist rebel leader, 40 other guerrillas and a major base on
the main island of Luzon.
   Gen. Renato de Villa, the army chief of staff, presented the
captured guerrilla leader at a news conference and identified him
as Francisco Pascual, 41, a member of the central committee of the
Communist Party of the Philippines. De Villa refused to identify
the others or say where they were being held.
   He told reporters that Pascual and 40 other rebels were arrested
in raids Monday night in the northern province of Pangasinan, about
110 miles northwest of Manila.
   ``With the arrest of Mr. Francisco Pascual, the (rebel)
leadership as well as the entire organization is dealt another
crippling blow by the government,'' De Villa said.
   He said Pascual was in charge of party activities in the central
Luzon region north of Manila and was among rebel and government
officials who supervised a two-month cease-fire that ended in
February 1987.
   Peace talks between the rebels and the government of President
Corazon Aquino broke down in January 1987, and fighting resumed
immediately after the truce expired a few weeks later.
   Brig. Gen. Orlando Antonio, a regional commander who also
attended the news conference, said troops confiscated more than
2,000 sticks of dynamite in a separate sweep in Baguio City, a
mountain resort north of Pangasinan.
   Antonio said Pascual was arrested while on his way to a rebel
hideout in Dagupan, in Pangasinan.
   At the base, soldiers seized assorted documents, a computer and
radio equipment powerful enough to transmit messages to much of
central and northern Luzon, Antonio said.
   ``What we captured in Dagupan was actually an underground house
of the military staff,'' said Pangasinan provincial commander Col.
Romeo Odi. ``In other words, they were orchestrating their
operations from that particular communications center ... And so,
with that capture, we are able to paralyze their operations.''
   Officials said the rebels planned to use the explosives to blow
up bridges and other targets in Luzon's Cagayan Valley, a rebel
stronghold.
   Pascual's arrest brings to at least five the number of central
committee members captured by the military this year. Among those
were party general secretary Rafael Baylosis and Romulo Kintanar,
chief of the communist New People's Army.

   An innocent plea was entered Tuesday on
behalf of a Florida doctor charged with setting fire to a symbolic
shantytown built on the Yale University campus by anti-apartheid
activists.
   Elwood Bracey, 52, an ear, nose and throat specialist from West
Palm Beach, Fla., who was graduated from Yale in 1958, was allowed
to enter the plea without being present for the arraignment.
   Bracey, charged with third-degree arson, has been free on
$50,000 bond since the fire on an alumni weekend June 5.
   Douglas Daniels, the attorney who represented Bracey in Superior
Court, requested a jury trial for his client. A pretrial hearing
was set July 14.
   Bracey was attending an alumni weekend when he allegedly set
fire to shanties that had stood on a campus plaza since 1986. He
was turned in to police by another Yale graduate who spotted the
early-morning blaze.
   Daniels would not comment on reports there had been an offer, on
Bracey's behalf, to compensate the university for the damage caused
by the fire. The blaze destroyed some large planters and charred
the granite on which the shanties stood, as well as an adjacent
wall.
   Daniels would only say that Bracey had made ``no direct
representation in that regard.''
   The shanties were built by protestors at Yale who oppose
apartheid, the policy of separation of the races in South Africa,
and are seeking to get Yale to end all investment in companies
doing business there.

<TEXT>
   The world's seven richest nations pledged Tuesday
to foster growth in the newly industrialized economies of Asia and
encouraged them to boost the value of their currencies and lessen
their reliance on manufactured exports.
   The communique issued at the end of the economic summit here
said the ``newly industrializing economies'' of Asia _ an umbrella
term for Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan _ have become
``increasingly important in world trade.''
   These economies, the communique said,``are all characterized by
dynamic, export-led growth which has allowed them to treble their
share of world trade since 1960.''
   ``Other outward-oriented Asian countries are also beginning to
emerge as rapidly growing exporters of manufactures,'' the leaders
of the seven industrialized nations said in their statement.
   ``With increasing economic importance come greater international
responsibilities and a strong mutual interest in improved
constructive dialogue and cooperative efforts ... between the
industrialized countries'' and the emerging economies, the
communique said.
   It said the efforts could focus on such matters as currency,
trade, the stucture of the economies and broad policies such as
interest rates and governmental budgets that affect economies.
   The newly industrialized economies have been under strong
pressure, mainly from the United States, to increase the value of
their currencies and to offset their heavy reliance on the export
of manufactured goods by increasing their domestic consumption.
   Japan's minister of international trade and industry, Hajime
Tamura, came to the defense of the developing countries in a speech
here Monday, saying that they ``are being criticized as a threat to
the rest of the world just because their trade surpluses have been
swelling at an astonishing speed.''
   ``We should not nip the growth of burgeoning nations such as
these in the bud,'' Tamura, speaking through an interpreter, told a
joint meeting of the Empire and Canadian clubs.
   Later, a senior Japanese official at the summit told reporters
that the foreign ministers of the seven nations had reached a
consensus that ``there is a strong need to establish a dialogue
with these countries.''
   Tamura said Japan has made a concerted effort to restructure its
economy so as to increase manufactured imports, and the newly
industrializing economies will need to do the same thing.
   The communique said that the aim of such restructuring should be
to achieve ``the international adjustment necessary for sustained,
balanced growth of the world economy.''
   ``We encourage the development of informal processes which would
facilitate multilateral discussions of issues of mutual concern and
foster the necessary cooperation,'' the communique said.
   On the issue of trade, the communique said that the reduction of
large external trade balances on the part of some countries, which
imbalance the world economy, will require not only the efforts of
the industrialized countries but those of the newly industrializing
nations which have such surpluses.

<HEAD>Two South Africans Arrested After Aborted Commando Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABORONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two South African commandos were
arrested after South African soldiers fired at a Botswana police
patrol and injured three officers, the government said Tuesday.
   Botswana accused South Africa of ``state terrorism'' and said
the commandos were planning a raid on a target in Gaborone, the
capital.
   South Africa's military headquarters confirmed an army patrol
had fired on Botswana policemen Monday night while on an
intelligence mission across the border.
   The Botswana statement said the shooting occurred when commandos
surprised the police patrol along a railway line about four miles
south of Gaborone.
   Botswana said the police patrol was unarmed. South Africa said
Botswana police fired first, but the soldiers returned the shots
and then returned to their base in South Africa.
   The South African statement said the two whites arrested at the
roadblock were not part of the unit involved in the shootout. The
army declined further comment about the arrested men ``unless the
Botswana government provides more details.''
   South African commandos have crossed the border of neighboring
countries numerous times to raid suspected hideouts and bases of
the African National Congress. The ANC is the main guerrilla
movement fighting South Africa's government.
   ``This action was not aimed at the government or the people of
Botswana,'' the South African statement said. ``The accusation that
South Africa made itself guilty of state terrorism is preposterous,
especially coming from a country which allows terrorists to operate
from its territory against South Africa.''
   The office of President Quett Masire said the commandos were
``preparing to mount a raid in Gaborone.''
   Five commandos escaped, but police said two South African
commandos were arrested at an army roadblock and were being
questioned. Police identified hem as Corp. Johannes Basson, 25, and
Theodore Hermanhen, a police or army reservist, both of
Johannesburg. No age was given for Hermanhen.
   Earlier in June, after a series of bombings in Johannesburg and
Pretoria, South African Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok warned
the ANC of retaliation.
   The announcement of the arrests came hours after Gaborone police
reported a carbomb had exploded at dawn Tuesday near the home of a
building contractor in the capital.
   The presidential statement said the bombing was ``yet another
South African attempt on the lives of innocent Batswana.'' No one
was injured in the bombing.
   Botswana officials say they do not condone the presence of ANC
guerrillas, although the government is sympathetic to the ANC's
aims. The ANC seeks to end the apartheid system of racial
separation, to install a one-man, one-vote political system and to
establish government controls over major economic sectors.
   South African commandos have conducted several raids in Gaborone
against suspected ANC guerrillas allegedly using the city as a
staging post for sabotage attacks in South Africa.
   South African soldiers killed a man and three women in March
when they raided a house on Gaborone's outskirts. One person was
killed in a similar attack in May 1986, and 15 were killed in a
June 1985 raid.

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In scenes reminiscent of the Dust Bowl, the
unchecked prairie wind scratches precious topsoil from fields baked
dry and left unprotected by a relentless drought, then drifts the
dirt into ditches like snow.
   An estimated 3.5 million acres of North Dakota cropland have
each lost at least five tons of topsoil to wind erosion, a
four-fold increase in erosion from a year ago, according to the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
   Land is considered damaged by wind erosion if it loses at least
five tons an acre, an amount equal to a layer of soil as thick as a
dime spread over an acre.
   Worse, topsoil on millions of more acres on the Great Plains
could blow away this winter if the prolonged drought that is
destroying this year's crops doesn't end in time for some plants to
grow, officials say.
   ``This is as fine as you ever want to see it,'' SCS
conservationist Jay Fuhrer said as he dug into a pile of fine, dry
dirt piled in a ditch near Lincoln, southeast of Bismarck.
   Hills in the neighboring field were almost bare except for some
weeds. Young shoots of grain had been sandblasted away by blowing
dirt, he said.
   ``The green out here now is going to deteriorate,'' Fuhrer
predicted, bracing himself against wind that made the 102-degree
heat feel like a blast furnace.
   ``If this dries before it makes straw, it is just going to lay
down and then we are not going to have any barrier at all. That's
what worries me now.''
   Nationally, wind erosion damage in 10 Great Plains states this
winter and spring was triple the average figure, the SCS said.
   ``Spring droughts are very, very unusual,'' Tom George, the SCS
administrator in Washington in charge of erosion surveys, said
Tuesday. ``That's seeding time, and all those acres are exposed.''
   The drought is severe enough that it has even stunted the growth
of weeds that could help protect the fragile topsoil, said Lyle
Samson, state agronomist for the SCS in North Dakota.
   North Dakota has been the hardest hit. About 12 percent of the
state's 30 million acres of cropland was damaged by wind erosion
from November to May, and an additional 7.4 million acres were
considered vulnerable.
   ``It is looking very bad,'' said Samson. ``You have got to have
hope, for goodness sake. It is ... June. We have a lot of summer
ahead of us. Whenever we receive rain, it becomes a new ball game.''
   Precipitation amounts in parts of central and western North
Dakota are the lowest they have been since 1936, according to the
National Weather Service. Bismarck has received 4.2 inches of
precipitation since Sept. 1, or 6.46 inches less than normal.
   Between November and May, wind eroded at least 17.5 million tons
of topsoil and blew strongly enough to damage 450,000 acres of
crops in North Dakota, Sampson said.
   Last year, 792,300 acres of cropland were damaged by wind
erosion, and another 4.9 million acres were labeled vulnerable.
   Nationally, 13.1 million acres in the Great Plains were damaged
by wind erosion, George said. The average is 4.7 million acres. An
additional 19.4 million acres is listed vulnerable this year, up
from an average of 8.5 million.
   South Dakota has lost topsoil on 1.5 million acres. Montana has
had 1.8 million acres eroded.
   If the drought continues, North Dakota faces an ``awfully dirty
winter'' of blowing dirt, perhaps even worse than the Dust Bowl era
when today's farm machinery wasn't available, Samson said.
   The best conservation practices cannot guarantee protection
against wind erosion in a drought, he said.
   ``You have to have rain,'' he said. ``We are just absolutely at
the mercy of the elements.''
   The drought killing off most plant growth that protects the soil
from the worst wind erosion during the winter also creates problems
when heavy rain eventually breaks the cycle.
   ``You have the paradox of the drought making you vulnerable to
water erosion,'' Samson said.

   His alfalfa crop was devastated by the
drought, but Bob Atkinson was determined to find a profitable use
for his parched farmland.
   Atkinson's field is next to the Alpine Valley Music Theater.
When 60,000 fans turned out Sunday for the first of four concerts
by the rock group the Grateful Dead, Atkinson found uninvited
guests in his fields.
   ``We could either fight it or go along with it. When they move
in on you, you might as well make the best of the situation,''
Atkinson said.
   So Atkinson is charging the 400 impromptu camper groups on his
property $5 each, and cutting his other crop losses.
   Atkinson said he, like other farmers in southeastern Wisconsin,
is suffering through the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days of
the 1930s.
   His alfalfa is 50 percent down, and oats and wheat are basically
shot, he said.
   And he's not thrilled with his human cash crop.
   ``We wouldn't have done it if they hadn't moved in Saturday
night,'' he said. ``I don't like it. I'd just as soon be at home
taking care of business under the shade tree.''

   A federal agency labeled it a terrorist
attack and a congressman equated it to putting razor blades in
Halloween candy.
   Nails had been driven into 200-year-old Douglas fir trees down
the side of Holcomb Peak in southern Oregon's Siskiyou Mountains in
a zig-zag pattern like a spray of bullets from a machine gun.
   The practice is called tree spiking, an attempt to save trees by
making it dangerous to cut them down and mill them. When a logger's
chainsaw or a band saw hits a nail, it can break, sending metal
flying like shrapnel.
   Overall, environmental groups believe that logging has reduced
old-growth forests to 10 percent of the 25 million acres they once
covered Oregon and that represent a unique ecosystem that must be
preserved.
   ``Tree-spiking is a radical environmentalist's version of razor
blades in Halloween candy and rat poison in Tylenol,'' U.S. Rep.
Bob Smith, R-Ore., said after the spiking was discovered last month.
   Endorsed in the 1985 primer for environmental sabotage,
``Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching,'' spiking has lost
any legitimacy it may have had, even among members of the radical
environmental group Earth First!, known as the Monkeywrench Gang,
which stages protests.
   But this incident could well be a sign that the war of the woods
is escalating as opponents become discouraged with the loss of the
biggest trees in the forest, environmentalists and federal
officials say.
   ``The way I see it, it's a last resort of people who are really
totally frustrated with the process,'' said Robert Brothers, an
Earth First! Siskiyou activist who lives in this small community
outside Grants Pass.
   ``As long as they don't kill anybody, it's fine with me. As long
as they do it someplace else. Not in my backyard. Then we have to
deal with talking about tree spiking pro and con instead of talking
about old-growth pro and con.''
   Steve Marsden, another Earth First! activist, said he has seen
spiked trees logged anyway and left on the forest floor to rot.
   ``Personally, I don't think it works,'' said Marsden, of Wolf
Creek. Logging companies ``just cut them down to show they are the
boss.''
   The Holcomb Peak spiking won't stop the area from being logged,
said Hank Snow, vice president at Medford Corp., which owns the
right to log trees in the area. He said the timber company would
use metal detectors to look for spikes before cutting them down.
   ``We don't like to even comment on (spiking),'' he said.
``People are only seeking publicity.''
   Timber is Oregon's leading industry, providing 73,900 jobs.
Forest products output for 1986 in Oregon was $3.4 billion,
according to the state Department of Economic Development.
   The Holcomb Peak incident was discovered after anonymous letters
postmarked in Chicago were received by the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management and Medford.
   An axiom of tree spiking is to issue a warning, so no one gets
hurt, although a California millworker was critically injured last
year when a band saw broke on a spiked tree.
   When news of the Holcomb Peak spiking failed to appear in local
newspapers, the spikers apparently got impatient and left nails
along the side of a logging road to point the way, said Harold
Belisle, manager of Land Management's Grants Pass Resource Area.
   Kurt Austermann, spokesman for Medford District, said the Bureau
of Land Management considers spiking terrorism. Austermann said
Monday that the reward for information about the spiking incident
had reached $13,000.
   The Holcomb Peak incident was the third spiking in recent years
in the Medford District in southern Oregon, said Linda Schalk, a
law enforcement agent for the federal agency.
   Andy Kerr of the Oregon Natural Resources Council said people
who spike trees are frustrated with environmental organizations,
like his, that stress negotiation, legal action and building
congressional support.
   ``We get nasty letters from these people,'' he said. ``We
wouldn't go out and sit in front of bulldozers or spike trees, so
we're wimps.''
   Litigation has been the most successful means of halting
old-growth logging. The latest victory for environmentalists came
in a preliminary injunction issued by a federal appeals court that
blocked 33 timber sales in Oregon pending the outcome of a lawsuit
over protection of the Northern spotted owl. The case was brought
by a coalition of about a dozen environmental groups, including the
Oregon Natural Resources Coaltion.

Year</HEAD>

   The House on Tuesday approved a $282 billion
fiscal 1989 defense bill that included $3.5 million for the
administration's Star Wars anti-missile program but continued for a
fourth straight year a leveling-off of President Reagan's military
buildup.
   The vote was 360 to 53.
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, represents about a 4
percent cut in purchases of military weapons systems, while
increasing military pay and money for operation and maintenance,
reflecting congressional preference for maintaining readiness of
fighting forces over developing new technology.
   Together with other money bills, the defense measure would
provide a total of $299.6 billion for military and intelligence
activities in the year that begins Oct. 1, essentially a freeze on
defense spending for the fourth straight year.
   For Reagan's Star Wars system, the bill would provide $3.5
billion in development money, a reduction from the current year's
$3.9 billion and far below the administration's request for 1989 of
$4.8 billion.
   It provides $410 million to support drug enforcement, including
money for purchase of radar aircraft, helicopters and patrol boats.
   Also included was an estimated $20 billion or so to fund U.S.
intelligence programs through the CIA and other agencies. The exact
amount is classified.
   Military personnel would get a 4 percent pay increase under the
bill, which would maintain an active-duty strength of 2.1 million.
The increase is part of a $78.4 billion personnel budget.
   Another $80.7 billion is earmarked for buying weapons. Among
big-ticket items are $1.4 billion for 545 M-1 Abrams tanks, $871
million for 72 Apache attack helicopters, $1.9 billion for 66
Trident II missiles, $1.3 billion for a Trident submarine, $2.3
billion for 84 F-A-18 fighter planes, $2.1 billion for three
destroyers, $1 billion for four C-17 transport planes and $807
million for a dozen MX missiles.
   The bill includes $100 million for rail basing of the MX
missile, $693 million less than the administration asked, and $600
million for the Midgetman missile, $400 million less than Reagan
wanted. The balance between the small ICBM and the rail-based MX is
expected to be settled in a House-Senate conference on defense
authorizing legislation.
   As it considered the bill, the House adopted an amendment by
Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., requiring the Navy to report on the causes
and circumstances of death for 17 recruits who died during training
since 1986.
   Roth's amendment stems from the death of Lee Mirecki, who died
March 2 during Navy rescue swimmer training in Florida.
   Roth said he has been unable to obtain the results of a Navy
inquiry into the death.
   The House also adopted an amendment by Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.,
stipulating that no federal money be spent in any workplace which
is not drug-free.
   At the same time, the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee
Tuesday adopted a similar $282 billion money bill and scheduled the
measure for full committee action on Friday.
   That version included slightly more _ $3.7 billion _ for the
Star Wars program and provided $199 million for drug interdiction.
   The subcommittee approved an amendment by Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, giving Israel the right to bid on the same basis as NATO
countries on defense procurement contracts.

   Police on Tuesday detained a journalist
who reported the pre-trial testimony of the gunman accused of
trying to assassinate Premier Turgut Ozal.
   Kartal Demirag, 32, shot at Ozal and wounded him in the hand
Saturday as the premier spoke at a convention of his Motherland
Party in Ankara.
   Erbil Tusalp, a reporter in Ankara for the Istanbul daily
Cumhuriyet, was taken into custody after he refused to reveal the
name of the source who provided him with a copy of the gunman's
testimony, according to Halil Nebiler, another Cumhuriyet reporter.
   
   Tusalp's front-page article, which included the would-be
assassin's testimony, was published Monday in the moderate-leftist
newspaper.
   Police told the reporter that he was being detained ``for
violating the secrecy of the investigation.'' The State Security
Court examining the attempted assassination ordered police and
state officials not to comment on the investigation.
   Later Tuesday, police returned with Tusalp to the newspaper
office and demanded to search it, but bureau chief Yalcin Dogan
refused to allow the action without a court order.
   Chief prosecutor Nusret Demiral and his assistants have been
interrogating Demirag since Saturday.
   Nebiler said Tusalp was detained under Demiral's order.
   Tusalp reported that Demirag said he did not have any
accomplices in the shooting.
   In the story, the gunman was quoted as saying he chose the site
of the shooting ``just to make it sensational'' and wanted to die
because of poor health and psychological problems. Demirag was
quoted as saying he thought he would be killed immediately by
Ozal's security police.
   According to Turkish newspapers, the gunman has been giving
contradictory testimonies since he was arrested.
   According to the Istanbul daily Hurriyet, Demirag said that he
did not act alone. But the report did not say which group he
claimed to be working with, or provide other details.
   Demirag had been a member of the youth organization of the
defunct neo-fascist National Movement Party, according to the
reports. The youth group is known as the Gray Wolves or the
Idealist Clubs, which were involved in a wave of terrorism that
claimed 5,000 lives in 1978-80.
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot and wounded Pope
John Paul II in 1981, also was accused of belonging to the Gray
Wolves.
   Turkish newspapers pointed out similarities in the two cases.
   Both came from poor families, escaped from prison and possessed
foreign currency at the time of the shootings, the dailies said.
   Cumhuriyet columnist Ugur Mumcu wrote on Tuesday that Demirag is
using tactics similar to Agca's to confuse investigators.

   Fields are so dry because of the drought
that one farmer returning home from his fields after a day of
harvesting winter wheat turned around and found the field behind
him ablaze.
   Regis Krebs of Beckemeyer, a town of 1,100 located 45 miles east
of St. Louis, had pointed his combine toward home when he noticed
the fire, which apparently was caused by a spark from the combine's
muffler.
   ``I'd just as soon forget about it,'' Krebs said Tuesday.
``Luckily, it was just a minor fire. It just burned a little corner
of the field.''
   ``He lost a couple acres of wheat in about 10 minutes,''
Beckemeyer fire chief Vincent Pollman said of the Monday night
fire. ``Everything is bone dry and it went up quickly.''
   Pollman said there's not a lot farmers can do to prevent those
kinds of fires when fields become parched. Dry, brittle grass and
straw need very little to ignite in drought conditions, he said.
   ``All it takes is a spark from a hot muffler, or for a bearing
to go out and heat up,'' Pollman said. ``As dry as it's been around
here, I'm surprised we haven't had more calls this summer. We need
a good rain.''

   One of seven Florida
panthers equipped with a radio collar in Everglades National Park
has been found dead, near where she bore a litter, park officials
said.
   The animal had apparently been in a fight, possibly with another
panther.
   Park researchers on a daily flight to monitor positions of the
endangered cats picked up a ``mortality signal'' from the collar
June 10. The signal is emitted from the collar when an animal is
still for an extended time.
   The panther, FP-15, was found by a ground crew the following
day, said park spokeswoman Pat Tolle.
   The cat had just given birth but none of her kittens could be
found. Her remains were brought to Miami's Metro Zoo for necropsyy,
but veterinarian Scott Citino said Monday that a cause of death
hasn't been determined.
   ``There were some bite wounds, but we're not sure what made
them,'' he said, adding that the kittens probably were killed by
the same animal.
   The bites were on the cat's foreleg were apparently inflicted by
a large animal, possibly another panther.
   The park's radio collar project, which began in 1986, was
designed to study the habits of the endangered animals. Only about
30 panthers are believed to remain in South Florida, mostly in the
park or the adjacent Big Cypress National Preserve.

   An ambulance the banned Solidarity trade
union bought with U.S. money was formally donated to the Polish
state health service on Tuesday.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Adam Dyczkowski, representing Solidarity,
donated the $40,000 West German-made vehicle, decorated with a
Solidarity ribbon, to a representative of the health service in the
southwestern city of Wroclaw.
   Two other ambulances that were bought by Solidarity from a $1
million U.S. government grant have arrived in the western city of
Gorzow Wielkopolski, according to Solidarity spokesman Grzegorz
Jaszuski.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has decided to donate the entire
grant to Poland's money-starved state health system.
   Solidarity's acceptance last year of the grant has been cited by
Polish authorities to support their charge that the illegal union
is a paid agency of a foreign power.
   Tuesday's ceremony was attended by U.S. Ambassador John R. Davis.

<TEXT>
   A state senator on Tuesday proposed
legislation that would require training for the ``gatekeepers'' who
regularly deal with teen-agers in an effort to prevent suicide.
   Sen. Nicholas Spano's plan also would require that journalism
classes train future reporters in the coverage of suicides and that
posters with hot line numbers be put up in places frequented by
teen-agers.
   Under Spano's proposals, the state's mental health commissioner
would be required to develop a suicide prevention training program
for guidance counselors, social workers, parent groups, law
enforcement personnel and ``other pertinent gatekeepers.''
   Spano, a Repubican who chairs the Senate Mental Hygiene
Committee, charged that New York state was ``losing its battle to
eliminate teen suicides.''
   Spano issued a report that noted that in 1986 there were 112
suicides in New York state of people ages 10 to 19. Researchers
have estimated that for every teen-age suicide there are probably
100 to 300 attempts, he said.
   Training in journalism classes, Spano said, ``would ensure a
better understanding by future journalists of the impact a suicide
story may have on an adolescent contemplating suicide or families
of victims.''
   The legislation that would require journalism classes to teach
about suicide reporting has no Assembly sponsor. That's usually a
sign that the measure stands little chance of becoming law.
   No quick action appears likely on any of the major portions of
Spano's package of seven bills. Only one has come out of committee
to the full Senate. That would require uniform guidelines for
hospital emergency rooms handling attempted suicides.

<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday imposed a 60-day
curfew in the capital and banned public gatherings after six people
were killed and a police station burned in demonstrations by
thousands of protesters.
   Government radio said the restrictions began immediately. The
curfew extends from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   Stone-throwing duels broke out between police and thousands of
protesters after authorities closed a Rangoon university where
students had staged peaceful anti-government rallies, witnesses
said.
   ``Five police personnel were killed, and 26 others seriously
wounded as a result of an attack by unruly mob armed with swords,
sticks and catapults,'' the broadcast said. ``A member of the mob
also was killed and several others wounded.''
   ``Since these violent acts disrupt public tranquility, and cause
public disorder, the Rangoon Divsion Peoples Council deemed it
necessary to impose a curfew and ban public meetings and
demonstrations within the Rangoon municipal area,'' it said.
   The broadcast said the crowd set fire to one police station and
to the living quarters of another station. They damaged
government-owned movie theaters and traffic light posts, it said.
   The government announced Monday that classes at Rangoon Arts and
Science University, its affiliate colleges and the Institute of
Economics were suspended after an upsurge of student protests
against the 25-year-old rule of Gen. Ne Win.
   Another government radio broadcast announced the suspension of
classes, effective Wednesday, of two more institutions where
students had staged peaceful anti-government rallies: the Institute
of Medicine and the Institute of Dental Science.
   Authorities on Monday suspended classes at the Rangoon Arts and
Science University, its affiliate colleges and the Institute of
Economics.
   Throughout last week, students at the institutions held meetings
and put up posters on campus that demanded the government release
detained students, reinstate those expelled in earlier protests and
legalize student unions, according to witnesses who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said the demonstrators, who had grown to 5,000, hurled
stones and other objects and forced police to retreat a block to a
military barricade. The protesters then dispersed.
   In the nearby Sanchaung area of the city, there were sporadic
clashes between protesters and police, who reportedly used tear gas
and firearms. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties
in those clashes.
   Several days of student unrest at Rangoon universities climaxed
on March 18 with anti-government riots that police and military
units rapidly crushed.
   According to diplomatic sources in Bangkok, Thailand, as many as
100 people may have died in the March violence. The government said
two students were shot by riot police.

<HEAD>`M-A-S-H' Actress Urges Statute for Women at Vietnam Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Loretta Swit clashed politely Tuesday
with the female designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial over a
proposal to place a new statue near the memorial honoring the
10,000 women who are ``invisible veterans'' of the Southeast Asian
conflict.
   As cameras rolled, Miss Swit told a House hearing that erecting
an 8-foot bronze statue of an Army nurse at the 2.2-acre memorial
site would help heal the emotional wounds of female Vietnam
veterans.
   ``The greatest tragedy of their service is that it has gone
untold, unrecognized and for the most part unknown,'' said Miss
Swit, who played an Army nurse in the long-running TV series
``M-A-S-H.''
   She was followed to the witness table by New York architect Maya
Lin, who strongly opposed any additions or major alterations to her
design for the memorial, a black granite wall bearing the names of
58,156 Vietnam war dead including eight nurses.
   Noting that a statue of three combat-weary infantrymen was added
to the memorial at the insistence of former Interior Secretary
James Watt, Ms. Lin called the proposed nurse's statue ``a
misdirected attempt at tit-for-tat equality for women.''
   ``I cannot foresee how quiet and respectful this area will
remain if we continue to add to it or to adorn it, filling the area
with political concessions and turning the quiet sanctuary of the
memorial into a cluttered sculpture garden,'' she said.
   The Senate approved the woman's statue last week, 96-1. The lone
dissenter, Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., warned that ``we are turning
the Vietnam memorial into something of a jumble.''
   At Tuesday's hearing by a House Post Office and Civil Service
subcommittee, the proposal was endorsed by several members of
Congress and major veterans' organizations, but opposed by the
Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning
Commission.
   The approval of both those independent agencies, as well as the
interior secretary, is required before any monuments can be erected
on national parkland in Washington. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel
has approved adding a woman's statue to the Vietnam memorial.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., applauded the Supreme Court's
decision Monday that upheld a New York City ordinance barring
private, all-male clubs from discriminating against women, and said
Congress should make a similar decision about the Vietnam memorial.
   ``This is a male club,'' Gejdenson said. ``I think we ought to
break it up.''
   But Laurie Maurer, a board member of the American Institute of
Architects, said adding a woman's statue would be like drawing a
mustache on another artist's painting, or putting an equestrian
statue of George Washington atop the Washington Monument to
``complete'' it.
   Shelley Mastran, a university geography professor from
Washington, said adding a statue of a female nurse would amount to
``Disneyfication'' of the Vietnam memorial. Retired Marine Col.
Mary Evelyn Bane said it would be ``discriminatory'' against female
members of the military.
   Brown and Ms. Lin said it would be preferable to build a
memorial to all American women who have served in the armed forces
since World War II. Congress authorized such a monument in November
1986, and a site at the main entrance to Arlington National
Cemetery has been approved.
   The Vietnam memorial, which was built with $11 million in
private funds, has become the most popular tourist attraction of
any national monument in Washington. An estimated 20 million people
have visited the memorial since it was dedicated in November 1982.

   Two light aircraft flying side by side
collided about 195 miles west of Iceland, and an air and sea search
continued Tuesday for a missing pilot, civil aviation authorities
said.
   The other plane, piloted by an American identified only as Chase
H. Osborne, landed safely at Reykjavik Airport Monday night despite
a damaged wing, they said.
   The missing pilot was believed to be British but the British
Consulate in the Icelandic capital did not release his identity.
   The two Maule single-engined propeller planes were being
delivered to owners in Europe and had taken off from Goose Bay,
Newfoundland, said Skuli Jon Sigurdarson, a civil aviation official.
   They stopped at Narsarsuaq, Greenland, before continuing to
Iceland, he said.
   After Osborne radioed word of the collision to Reykjavik on
Monday evening, coast guard planes and ships mounted a search,
joined by merchant vessels and aircraft from the U.S. military base
at Keflavik.

<HEAD>Communists Allowing Another Political Voice In Estonia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party is allowing a large group in
Estonia to make a small dent in its monopoly on political power,
but while the grassroots organization wants regional autonomy it
largely backs Kremlin policy.
   The People's Front of Estonia says its goal is to promote the
party's program of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring of Soviet
society launched by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   While its stated goal is to support Moscow's policies, the
political group appears to be tapping rising public dissatisfaction
with the Communist Party, which the central press has accused
recently of being full of careerists with little concern for the
people.
   The People's Front is careful not to call itself a political
party, instead referring to itself in a 12-point platform published
June 7 in Sovietskaya Estonia as ``a democratic movement based on
citizen initiative.''
   Sovietskaya Estonia reported June 11 the People's Front was
formed in April and amassed 800 local affiliates throughout Estonia
with more than 40,000 members.
   Formation of such a group as the People's Front would have been
impossible before Gorbachev became the party's general secretary in
March 1985 and launched his ``glasnost'' policy, which encourages
openness on many political, social and historical issues.
   ``In 1985-1986 we learned bravely to think, in 1987 bravely to
speak and in 1988, it's time to get experience in acting bravely,''
one of the founders of the People's Front, Estonian economist Edgar
Savisaar, said in a June 7 article in Sovietskaya Estonia.
   While generally supporting Communist Party policies, the
Estonian group puts more emphasis on ``political and economic
sovereignty'' of the 15 Soviet republics, and the ``cultural
autonomy'' of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   Estonia, on the Baltic Sea, has been the scene last year and
this year of several demonstrations asserting national rights.
   Extensive coverage of the People's Front's activities in
Sovietskaya Estonia, the newspaper of Estonia's Communist Party and
government, shows the organization has official backing.
   There was new evidence Tuesday the Estonian Communist Party is
taking the People's Front seriously. Vajno I. Vaelaes, named
Estonia's Communist Party chief on Thursday last week, told the
government newspaper Izvestia some of the group's proposals have
been included in a ``Republic Platform.''
   The platform is to be presented at a nationwide party conference
on Tuesday next week.
   Not all of the informal political groups formed under the banner
of glasnost have had it so easy. The Democratic Union, a group
dissidents formed May 9 as an alternative to the Communist Party,
has been harassed through arrests of group members after
demonstrations in Leningrad, Moscow and Kiev. The official press
has sharply condemned the group.
   The group says it intends to put forward candidates for
government posts and suggest legislation to local governing
councils called soviets. It says it wants to fight corruption,
stagnation and Stalinism _ all themes trumpeted recently by the
Communist Party.
   The only condition for membership is ``active and businesslike
support of the course of perestroika of the Communist Party.''
   In an assurance to the government, the group pledges to abide by
the Estonian Constitution and the republic's laws.
   The 20 million member Communist Party describes itself as ``the
leading and guiding force'' in Soviet society and holds a monopoly
on economic, cultural and political power.
   But the party's policy-making Central Committee has recommended
that the All-Union Party Conference convening in Moscow on June 28
encourage public organizations including ``public initiative
bodies.''
   ``They should use their right to initiate bills, send
representatives to the bodies of power, (and) be partners of the
state in pursuing social programs,'' according to the
recommendations.
   Sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a Gorbachev adviser, said last
month she supports the idea of ``social institutions or people's
unions'' to assist and advise the party. But she ruled out
establishment of competing parties.

<HEAD>EPA to Designate 215 Sites for Addition to Cleanup Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Tuesday it plans to designate 215 more toxic wastes sites as
eligible for money from the ``Superfund'' toxic waste dump cleanup
program.
   In addition, 14 more sites owned by federal agencies were
proposed for the National Priority List for cleanups, though they
are not eligible for Superfund money.
   The planned update of the list, the seventh since the program
began in 1982, would be the largest since June 1984, when 244 sites
were announced.
   Tuesday's proposals would bring the priority list to 1,177 sites
_ 799 formally designated and 378 awaiting designation.
   In addition, three sites have been deleted from the list because
cleanup work is complete and proposals to list 30 more are being
dropped because the agency now believes cleanups are better
performed under other laws.
   Elaine Stanley, deputy head of Superfund enforcement, said
actions are under way at most of the 30 sites, all of which are
owned by permit holders under the federal hazardous waste disposal
laws.
   Jack McGraw, deputy assistant EPA administrator in charge of
Superfund, told reporters the change might even speed cleanups
because many of the 30 are controlled by large companies who are
eager to ``go ahead and try to reduce what they call their
`liability inventory.'''
   Thirteen of the 215 proposed sites involve hazardous waste
facilities where EPA does not believe the waste law can be used,
because the owner refuses to negotiate or for some other reason.
   Generally, it takes a year to 18 months after proposal for
public comment and agency response before a site is formally added
to the priority list, although EPA sometimes begins studies of
possible remedies before the final designation. The agency says 97
percent of proposed sites wind up on the list. Proposals generally
are made once a year.
   EPA has 29,463 places in its computers as potential hazardous
waste sites and has completed investigations at 8,875. Only the
worst threats to health and the environment, according to a
complicated numerical scoring system, are proposed for the priority
list.
   The agency has said it expects about 2,500 sites on the list
eventually.
   Once on the list, the site becomes eligible for 90 percent
federal financing of the cleanup, with the balance coming from the
state, unless it is owned by a state or local agency. The federal
government will pay only half the cleanup cost of those.
   But before federal and state money is used, EPA tries to get the
polluters responsible to clean up the site. Sometimes those people
are bankrupt, cannot be found or dispute their responsiblity. EPA
can go ahead and do the work and seek reimbursement later.
   The agency says it and the states have secured $600 million to
$700 million in cleanups from responsible parties; 191 court cases
are under way seeking $258 million and EPA has been reimbursed for
$78 million in cleanup work it performed.
   Spending about $1.5 billion a year, Superfund is simultaneously
one of the nation's largest environmental programs and one of the
largest public works programs.
   McGraw said EPA tried to propose as many sites as possible to
clear the pipeline before it begins changing the scoring system
this summer to meet congressional directives.
   Those changes will, among other things, take into account
threats to health through the food chain, give greater weight to
abandoned wells and try to account for potential later emissions of
contaminants into the air.
   The Superfund program came in for renewed criticism in recent
days.
   Last Friday the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
said EPA was largely ignoring congressional orders to prefer
permanent cleanups such as incineration or waste treatment methods
over leaving the waste in the ground and was overestimating costs
of treatment.
   On Monday, a waste treatment trade group and six environmental
organizations echoed OTA's findings in testimony before a House
subcommittee. They also contended that EPA was planning to leave
widely varying waste concentrations behind when cleanups are
complete.
   ``We have a technical response to each'' criticism of specific
cleanup decisions, EPA Assistant Administrator Winston Porter told
the subcommittee. He argued there was simply not enough money for
incineration at every site.

   Here are the 215 civilian sites the
Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to add to the National
Priority List for ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanups.
   Following this list is the list of 14 federal agency sites
proposed for listing.
   Together, the two groups bring the National Priority List to
1,177 sites, of which 378 are proposed sites and 799 have been
formally added to the list.
   Sites on the list are eligible for 90 percent federal financing
from the cleanup fund, unless owned by a federal agency or state or
local government. Federal agencies are responsible for cleaning up
their own sites with their own funds. State and local governments
must pay half.

   New Hampshire on Tuesday marked the 200th
anniversary of its decisive role in uniting the nation under the
Constitution with a plea to remember ``all those wonderful purposes
for which our government was formed.''
   The list of festivities commemorating New Hampshire's ninth and
deciding vote to ratify the Constitution included a speech by
former U.S. Chief Justice Warren Burger, a lobster dinner for 1,200
on the Statehouse lawn and bell-ringing by hundreds of children
using a replica of the Liberty Bell.
   New Hampshire's ratification ``created the United States in the
true sense of a nation,'' said Burger, chairman of the Commission
of the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.
   ``When New Hampshire took this action ... we really had a United
States of America for the first time,'' Burger said during a
Statehouse ceremony.
   Supporters of the Constitution ``knew ... the value of a power
of any kind depends on having it in some kind of harness, and that
is the genius of our system.''
   Burger also helped unveil a commemorative stamp portraying the
``Old Man of the Mountain,'' a granite formation in the White
Mountains that is the state symbol.
   During a morning service at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, the
Rev. David Glendinning urged Americans to ``never lose touch with
all those wonderful purposes for which our government was formed.''
   ``We are still, and need to be, one people,'' he said, adding
that it is critical that Americans not be overwhelmed by the
institution of government.
   State Rep. Russell Chase, of the committee that planned the
observance, said its goal was to ``to learn more, to know more, to
appreciate more, the institution that has carried us these 200
years.''
   New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution
on June 21, 1788. The vote by the state's ratifying convention was
57-47.
   The 13 original colonies, already united by the Articles of
Confederation, had agreed the previous year in Philadelphia that
nine votes would be needed to ratify the new Constitution, which
created a strong central government.
   The ratification vote ended a long, bitter debate. Federalists
argued a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull
the country out of a post-war recession. Anti-Federalists said the
Constitution laid the groundwork for the kind of tyrannical central
government they fought in the Revolutionary War.
   Religion also was an issue, as many New Hampshire residents
opposed a passage eliminating any test of religion as a
qualification for public office.
   Federalist politicking gained force because eight states _
Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland and South Carolina _ already stood behind
the document.
   Five days after New Hampshire voted, Virginia became the 10th
state to ratify the Constitution.

<HEAD>Jewish Delegation Protests Pope's Upcoming Visits With Waldheim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two representatives of major Jewish
organizations met with a Vatican envoy Tuesday to protest Pope John
Paul II's upcoming meetings in Austria with President Kurt Waldheim.
   Dr. Avi Beker of the World Jewish Congress and Leon Feldman,
representing three other Jewish groups, said at a news conference
that they pointed out Waldhiem's past in Nazi Germany's army during
a meeting with Monsignor Renzo Fratini, counselor of the Apostolic
Delegation in Jerusalem.
   Fratini confirmed the meeting and said in an interview that he
would pass along the men's concern to the Vatican, which does not
have diplomatic relations with Israel.
   ``All signs show the pope is displaying his will and going out
of his way to legitimize Waldheim ... that he is actually trying to
penetrate public opinion, in effect challenging the information
campaign conducted by Jewish groups,'' Beker said.
   ``We expressed protest, as well as a hope that perhaps the pope
will now do what he failed to do during the previous visit, and
display some criticism about Waldheim's wartime activities and his
lies about his past,'' Beker said.
   Jewish organizations have charged that Waldheim was involved in
Nazi war crimes during his service with the German army during
World War II.
   Waldheim denies any wrongdoing, but the United States has barred
his entry into the country, saying it found evidence he was
involved in deportations of Balkan civilians in World War II.
   Feldman represents the B'nai B'rith, the American Jewish
Committee and the Synagogue Council of America. Jewish
organizations also protested a year ago when the pope met Waldheim
at the Vatican.
   During John Paul's visit to Austria he will meet Waldheim on at
least three occasions between June 23-27, according to a copy of
the pope's itinerary supplied by the World Jewish Congress.
   Beker said the pope's planned prayer service at the Mauthausen
concentration camp June 24, a day after he is received by Waldheim,
was in particularly ``bad taste.''
   ``The visit to Mauthausen, which is to honor the Holocaust
victims, is actually a desecration of their memory because of these
meetings with Waldheim,'' he said.

   Here are the sites proposed for deletion from
those proposed earlier for the National Priority List for
``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanups by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
   The agency said these sites generally are part of an
installation holding a permit under the federal hazardous waste
law, although they may not be actively handling waste. Cleanups are
better handled by the owner under that law, although nothing
prevents use of Superfund later if it should prove desirable, EPA
said.
   In addition, the agency deleted three sites from the list in
April because work had been completed or there was no longer a
threat from them. They were the Mountain View Mobile Home Estates
in Globe, Ariz.; the Middletown Road Dump in Annapolis, Md.; and
the Harris Site on Farley Street in Houston, Texas.

<HEAD>Meese Says Drug Money Needed For Prosecution, Prisons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America is gaining in the war on
drugs but must ensure money is spent on prosecution and jails as
well as seizing illegal drugs, Attorney General Ed Meese told state
attorneys general Tuesday.
   ``The sad truth is ... as long as enough people pay enough often
enough for drugs, somebody's going to find a way to get those drugs
to them,'' Meese told about 40 attorneys general holding a four-day
meeting.
   Several anti-drug bills are pending before Congress, and Meese
said there will be a ``bipartisan executive-legislative summit''
during the next few weeks ``to fashion a bill that would have the
support of both parties and both the executive and legislative
branches.''
   On other matters, Meese again refuted allegations the Justice
Department was slack in pursuing allegations of fraud in defense
contracting.
   ``It was the prompt and effective action by the Department of
Justice working with the Department of Defense, that brought the
case to the point of investigation now,'' he said.
   The investigation is part of the Reagan administration's
``unprecedented campaign against defense procurement fraud of all
sorts,'' he said.
   Meese said the publicity concerning the recent controversy and
resignations at the Justice Department ``hasn't been helpful.'' But
he said the controversy hasn't affected the office ``one way or the
other.''
   Meese said that, in the past, the tendency has been to put
anti-drug money into intercepting drugs and education programs.
   ``That's important, but when that's done the Congress has got to
... make sure we have the resources in prosecution, on the court
and in correctional facilities so we don't have the situation that
often occurs in many of your states _ judges reluctant to impose
appropriate sentences on people because they don't think there's
enough room in the prisons.''
   Meese said recent debate over whether drugs should be legalized
is the result of frustration because progress is slow in the battle
against drugs.
   But he said recent surveys indicate use by high school students
is down and argued that legalizing drugs has never worked in any
society.
   The United States signed an international agreement last year to
join other nations in battling drugs and legalization ``would put
us at odds with all the other civilized nations of the world,''
Meese added.
   This is the worst time to change national policies on drugs, he
said, because ``for the first time we are starting to make
progress. It certainly behooves us not to change our policies.''
   Delaware Attorney General Charles Oberly wondered if Meese was
not overstating the case about progress in the battle.
   ``My feeling is we haven't really seen any decrease'' in drug
use, he said.
   Meese agreed that ``we don't want to make too much out of
statistics,'' but added: ``The important thing is to recognize
there are changes in attitudes among high school students.''
   He said stepped-up efforts are needed to extend drug education
programs to high school dropouts and the unemployed.

<HEAD>Crew Probably Didn't See Huge Thunderstorms, Pilot Testifies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deadly thunderstorm that caused the
1985 crash of a Delta Air Lines jumbo jet was visible to air
traffic controllers but not to the aircraft's flight crew, a Delta
pilot testified.
   Capt. William Melvin, chairman of a safety committee for the
Airline Pilots Association, also said the crew of Flight 191 may
have been ``set up'' by wind shear training because flight
simulators did not include conditions comparable to the storm that
caused the crash.
   ``He (the pilot) could see the clouds, he could see rain,''
Melvin testified Monday. ``But he couldn't see the cloud
development because he was too close.''
   Melvin, a Dallas-based pilot and wind shear expert who was part
of the initial crash investigation, was Delta's final witness in a
non-jury trial being heard by U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr.
   The L-1011 widebody crashed Aug. 2, 1985, killing 137 people and
injuring 25 others while trying to land at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   Delta claims government meteorologists and air traffic
controllers failed to inform the crew of the worsening weather and
wants the government to pay all or part of the claims facing the
Atlanta-based airline. Delta and its insurance companies already
have paid more than $90 million in death, injury and damage claims,
and the final total is expected to exceed $100 million.
   Echoing testimony earlier in the trial by William Haggard, a
meteorologist, Melvin said he believed a smaller, milder rain cell
masked the high-altitude development of the severe storm from the
flight crew.
   But observers south of the storm, where air traffic controllers
were located, could clearly see the development, Melvin said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators determined
that the crash resulted from a microburst, a severe downburst from
a thunderstorm. Their report said the microburst contained several
wind shears, or strong, abrupt shifts in wind direction.
   Melvin said the crash was the first to document the presence of
more than one wind shear in a single storm. Computerized wind shear
models used in cockpit simulator training before the Flight 191
crash contained only one wind shear, he testified.
   ``The way pilots were trained is, once you get through these
things, there wasn't any more,'' said Melvin. ``That could have set
up the pilots of Delta 191.''
   Lawyers for the government, which contends the flight crew
should have been able to avoid the crash, are expected to begin
presenting their case next week. The trial, which has been
continuing for over three months, is expected to continue for
several more months.

<TEXT>
   If people are willing to shell out
$10,000 to buy a parking spot, the town of South Kingston can't
stop Raymond V. McConnell from selling the spaces.
   The state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday ruled that the town has no
jurisdiction over McConnell's plan to sell 40 condominium parking
spaces in his lot at popular Green Hill Beach.
   McConnell and his wife have owned the lot for four years and
have been collecting daily parking fees from beachgoers.
   When McConnell, a dentist from Coventry, sought to sell
permanent rights to the parking spaces, South Kingstown officials
objected, saying he would have to seek a subdivision permit from
the town zoning and planning boards.
   But Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay, in the high court's unanimous
opinion, wrote that McConnell's plan falls under the state's
condominium law, which provides that plans to convert a property
from rental to condominium ownership cannot be regulated by local
boards.
   ``The conversion of the McConnells' lot is a mere change in the
form of its ownership and not a subdivision of land,'' Fay wrote.
``Because this parking area was not subject to subdivision
requirements before its conversion, it cannot be subject to these
requirements afterward.''
   McConnell said Tuesday that while the legal fees may drive the
price up beyond $10,000, he expects no difficulty in selling the
spaces.
   ``The demand is there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senators Voice Concern Over Proposed Arms Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty senators have told the Reagan
administration they are concerned that a proposed sale of
sophisticated U.S. fighters, missiles and munitions to Kuwait may
pose a threat to Israel and would further fuel the Middle East arms
race.
   In a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the senators
questioned the reasoning behind the sale decision, asking whether
Kuwait has agreed to give more active protection to its own
shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   The letter was sent to Shultz on Friday and was made public
Tuesday.
   The arms sale package includes 40 F@A-18 Hornet fighter
aircraft, 40 Harpoon missiles, 120 Sidewinder missiles, 300
Maverick missiles, 200 Sparrow missiles, 400 laser-guided bombs and
200 cluster bombs.
   The senators said they are concerned that the combat-range of
the Hornet could be extended to permit attacks on Israel by basing
it in Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Iraq or by adding larger fuel tanks.
   ``Accordingly, we conclude that it is critically important to
have the assurances of Kuwait that these aircraft will never be
based or deployed closer to Israel than they would be at their base
in Kuwait and that they never will be based in or based to a state
bordering Israel,'' the senators said.
   They asked for assurances that Kuwait will not seek and the U.S.
government will not sell equipment to extend the range of the
planes.
   Additionally, they said they are concerned that the highly
accurate and reliable Maverick missile might ``fall into unfriendly
hands.''
   ``The Maverick has destructive capabilities that far exceed the
legitimate security requirements of Kuwait,'' the senators said and
added: ``We cannot afford to have our most sophisticated, sensitive
and efficient weapons sold without predictable and desirable
consequences.''
   The letter was signed by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and these other senators:
   Sens. Dennis De Concini, D-Ariz; Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.;
Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii; Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md.; Bob Packwood, R-Ore.; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.;

D-Mass.

Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y.; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Quentin

<HEAD>NOW to Call for Jackson or `Non-White' Woman as Democratic No. 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women plans
to urge likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis to select rival
Jesse Jackson or a ``non-white'' woman as his running mate, the
group's president said Tuesday.
   Molly Yard said it would take the selection of Jackson, who is
very sensitive to women's issues, or ``a woman from Jackson's
constituency'' to smooth relations between the women's movement and
the Democratic Party.
   ``The whole stance of the party since 1984 has been to blame us
for the defeat of Mondale and Ferraro,'' she said.
   NOW, the nation's largest women's rights organization, has been
a major influence in Democratic politics and was a factor in the
selection of Geraldine Ferraro as Walter Mondale's running mate in
the 1984 presidential race. The ticket later was defeated by the
largest margin in the history of U.S. presidential races.
   Ms. Yard said the group plans to introduce a resolution calling
on Dukakis to heed their advice on the vice presidential choice.
The NOW president did not provide a date for the resolution, but
the group is holding its national conference in Buffalo this week.
   Dukakis is currently considering potential running mates.
Jackson, runner-up to the Massachusetts governor in the delegate
race, has said he has earned the right to be offered the No. 2
spot, but Dukakis has not made any commitment.
   Yard also charged that Democratic leaders have tried to keep NOW
out of the 1988 election.
   ``They say they don't want the party captive to special
interests,'' she said. ``I don't know how they can call the
nation's largest group of voters a special interest.''
   There are 10 million more women registered to vote than men, she
said.
   The NOW president also said the Democratic Party could lose the
women's vote and the 1988 presidential election if it doesn't pay
more attention to women's issues.
   Yard warned that millions of women would vote Republican if the
GOP is perceived as caring more than the Democrats about women.
   ``Even though their platform is a disaster, they'll get votes
because they're seriously considering a woman as a vice
presidential candidate,'' Yard said of the Republicans.
   ``Everything depends on who you showcase at the convention,''
she said.
   Elizabeth Dole, the former transportation secretary, is
considered a candidate for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket that
will be headed by all-but-certain nominee George Bush.
   Selection of Mrs. Dole as a running mate could hand Bush the
presidency, Yard said. Mrs. Dole is the wife of Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole who battled Bush unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   NOW calculates that Dukakis's apparent early lead over Bush
could disappear if he loses a significant portion of the women's
vote. National polls indicate Bush is running significantly behind
Dukakis among women while running about even among men.
   ``It's not the time for the Democrats to send signals that they
will in any way deny the importance of women's issues,'' she said.

<HEAD>Percentage of Jobless Drawing Unemployment Drops Fourth Straight
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of jobless workers drawing
unemployment benefits declined for the fourth year in 1987 as more
states tightened their eligibility requirements, according to a
study released Tuesday.
   In a 14-page analysis of Labor Department records, the Center on
Budget and Priorities, a liberal, foundation-financed research
group, said the unemployment insurance system protected only about
31.5 percent of the jobless last year.
   ``An average of 5.1 million of the 7.4 million unemployed
workers each month in 1987 did not receive unemployement insurance
benefits,'' the center said.
   The 31.5 percent of jobless workers drawing benefits, which
across the country average $139 a week, is the lowest on record
dating back to 1955, according to the report. The respective rates
of coverage in 1986 and 1985 were 32.7 percent and 32.9 percent.
   Coverage varied sharply among the states, ranging from a low of
16.6 percent of the unemployed workers receiving benefits in
Virginia to a high of 58.5 percent in Rhode Island.
   The maximum benefits also differ widely from state to state,
according to 1988 Labor Department data. Alabama is the lowest,
providing covered unemployed workers with a maximum of $120 a week.
Massachusetts is the highest at $354 per week.
   The center said seven straight years of national unemployment
rates of 7 percent or greater _ 1980 to 1986 _ forced many states
to raise their eligibility requirements and cut benefits to keep
their unemployment insurance funds solvent and replace borrowings
from the federal trust fund.
   It quoted a House Ways and Means Committee report that 37 states
in 1987 increased their earnings requirements for drawing maximum
benefits, while only three states relaxed them.

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Finishing Work On Medical Fees Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard professor nearing completion of a
report on the relative financial value of work done by different
types of doctors said Tuesday he believes his approach ultimately
will be embraced, though not loved, by the medical profession.
   ``Within the medical community ... there is a strong perception
that the fee structure is totally out of kilter,'' William C. Hsiao
told reporters.
   However, he acknowledged that a revised fee schedule based on
the relative value scale his team is finalizing will hold out the
prospect of ``winners and losers'' in the economic arena and thus
will be controversial among doctors.
   On the other hand, he expressed confidence that the medical
community as a whole accepts the premise that something must be
done to temper doctor bills rising at about 15 percent a year.
   And because Hsiao's Harvard team worked closely with the
American Medical Association and panels of physician advisers from
the various specialities, he said he belives the plan ultimately
will be accepted by doctors as preferable to potential alternatives
over which they have no control.
   Moreover, Hsiao continued, the fact that there are likely to be
many more ``winners'' than ``losers'' among the nation's 500,000
doctors suggests another pragmatic reason to predict ultimate
acceptance of the plan.
   The 1,000-page report flowing from the 2-year, $2.5 million
study is due at the Health Care Financing Administration _ which
oversees Medicare and Medicaid _ by July 31 and is to be made
public by the end of August.
   Hsiao said he did not expect it to have an immediate impact, but
predicted Congress will start hearings on it next spring and
probably will use the document in making budget decisions for
fiscal 1990.
   The project has generated keen interest within the medical
community because it raises the specter of massive changes in the
way doctors bill their patients.
   Hsiao declined to go into details of the report, but gave one
example of what he called an ``irrational price structure existing
in the physician market.''
   The present structure gives an incentive for doctors to perform
a $300, 30-minute procedure to detect ulcers by inserting a tube
down a patients throat while a complete physicial examination
taking about 45 minutes could accomplish the same degree of
diagnostic accuracy. The catch: the doctor could charge only about
$75 for such a ``non-invasive'' examination.
   The most obvious result of the report, financed mostly with
federal money, would be changes in the amount Medicare will pay for
each of the 7,000 different medical procedures assigned a numerical
code.
   However, private insurance companies use the same code system
and Hsiao said several of them have expressed interest in using
information from the forthcoming report to do pilot studies of the
way they pay bills.

   A sobbing mother pleaded Tuesday for the
return of her son, who she said was abducted from her hospital room
as she fed him the day after he was born.
   ``I would just like to beg to whoever took my baby to just bring
him back to us,'' Renee McClure of Lexington said during a brief
appearance at a news conference at High Point Regional Hospital.
   The child was taken Monday from his mother's arms by a woman who
said she needed to weigh the baby, the mother and officials said.
Jason Ray McClure was born to Richard and Renee McClure at 12:22
a.m. Sunday.
   He was the first Father's Day baby born at the hospital, and
television station WGHP in High Point broadcast a special segment
on him Sunday night.
   Hospital officials said guards have been added to the maternity
floor during all four scheduled daily feedings.
   ``We know the Lord would want you to do the right thing and
bring him back to us,'' the mother said. ``I beg you, please, bring
our son back to me and all will be forgiven and forgotten and God
will forgive you, I'm sure.''
   ``We love our son,'' she said.
   ``The woman that took him, I can understand if you lost a child
because almost lost Jason twice. I about miscarried him two times
and we worked real hard to get him here,'' Mrs. McClure said.
   As she was wheeled out of the news conference by her husband,
Mrs. McClure broke into tears.
   ``Everybody is trying to stick together and hold tight pretty
good,'' said McClure's brother, Randy. ``It's a big shock to
everybody.''
   Mrs. McClure did not answer questions. FBI agent Dan Wozniak
said she was ``going through a really difficult time. The most
important thing is getting this baby back.''
   He said authorities have many leads and ``many people working
around the clock.''
   During a feeding time Monday morning, a woman dressed in a white
uniform but without a hospital badge, came into Mrs. McClure's room
in the postpartum unit and said she was going to weigh the child,
hospital officials said.
   She carried Jason away.
   Five to 10 minutes later, a nursing assistant making her rounds
noticed that the baby's bassinet was empty. After the mother said
what happened, hospital officials immediately contacted the police
and all exits from the hospital were blocked.
   It is hospital policy to have nurses transport newborn babies
from the nursery to the mother in a bassinet. Hospital officials
said it would appear strange if someone carried a baby.
   ``This person was not someone known to the hospital,'' said
hospital Vice President Page Redpath.

<TEXT>
   Child-welfare officials sought temporary custody
of five children Tuesday after their mother was charged with
abandonment for leaving them without explanation at a hospital
emergency room.
   Brenda Shed, 31, who had been cited for neglect two years
earlier, was arrested early Tuesday after being interviewed by
police and caseworkers for the state Department of Children and
Family Services, said Police Youth Division Officer Terry Belinski.
   She was held pending a bail hearing and also is scheduled for a
probable cause hearing Wednesday on the felony abandonment charge,
Belinski said.
   Ms. Shed was cited by the DCFS for neglect in 1986 and her four
children then were placed in foster care for seven months, said
Dave Schneidman, a spokesman for the child-welfare agency.
   Police said she had been arrested previously on shoplifting
charges, and Schneidman said she admitted to having a codeine habit
in Tuesday's interview.
   The five children, girls aged 2, 4 and 5 and twin 9-year-old
boys, remained in an emergency shelter while DCFS officials sought
a court order to obtain temporary custody.
   Officials also were trying to find the children a foster home.
   ``She'll get to see the kids at some point, but they haven't
asked to see her,'' said Schneidman. ``They seem to be pretty
passive about their fate and she (the mother) does too. And that's
usually a bad sign.
   ``People in this situation usually show some emotion. They
scream, they cry, they defend themselves,'' he said.
   The children were examined Monday and found to be healthy. They
were well-dressed and the three school-aged children had
schoolbooks, said Belinski.
   Police said Ms. Shed told them she was ``financially stressed''
and had been evicted from a private apartment into which she moved
three months earlier from public housing.
   According to Ms. Shed's account, her 40-year-old sister,
Dorothy, came to the apartment as they were being evicted Monday
and said she would drive the family to a public-aid shelter.
   Instead, Dorothy Shed drove to Cook County Hospital and, while
her younger sister waited in the car, took the children to the
emergency room. There, she left Brenda Shed's name and told a
security guard, ``I'll pick these children up Thursday.''
   Youth Division officers picked up Dorothy Shed late Monday and
charged her with contributing to the dependency of a child, a
misdemeanor, said Belinski. She is scheduled to appear in court
July 8.
   But Schneidman said the children gave a different account.
   ``They said their aunt was driving around and trying to give
their mother advice, but that their mother seemed to be interested
only in talking about her boyfriend,'' said Schneidman.
   ``They said the aunt became disgusted and drove to the county
hospital because it's one of the few places where poor people feel
welcome and where she knew they'd get attention,'' he continued.
   Schneidman said Brenda Shed was cited for neglect in 1986 after
the children were found living alone for four days with only
``minimal food,'' and a neighbor looking in on them once a day.
   But a Juvenile Court judge ordered the family reunited in
November 1986, and ``called the case closed,'' said Schneidman.
``There was no follow-up investigation since then.''

   A coalition of business, government and
consumer leaders reported on Tuesday that increases in energy
efficiency can substantially improve the affordability of housing.
   The Alliance to Save Energy, and its chairman Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., reported that fuel bills, after mortgage and rent
payments, are the largest housing expense for the typical American
family, averaging $1,100 annually.
   The alliance released a report which shows that a 25 percent cut
in energy costs, saving $25 billion annually, could make housing
more affordable for 2 million households, half of whom are
low-income families.
   ``While typical middle-income households spend about one-fifth
of housing costs on energy, many low-income families spend more
than one-third,'' the alliance said in the report. ``Major changes
in energy expenses can thus increase or decrease housing
affordability significantly.''
   Wirth told a Capitol Hill news conference: ``It is our firm
belief that an enlightened energy policy can help ease the housing
problem we have today. If we are able to follow the recommendations
laid out by the Alliance report to make housing more affordable
through energy efficiency ... if we are able to link together the
imperatives of energy conservation and energy efficiency, we can
help to ease this very real housing crisis today.''
   Among its conclusions, the panel recommended federal initiatives
to:
   _Restore the federal responsibility for setting energy standards
for public and subsidized housing.
   _Require states to establish home energy rating systems within
basic federal guidelines.
   _Add energy efficiency investment incentives to housing finance
programs.
   _Incorporate energy efficiency provisions in rental assistance
programs.
   _Create tax incentives for housing energy efficiency to
stimulate more efficient construction and renovation practices,
especially in low income housing.
   _Require individual metering in federally assisted rental
housing, while requiring such buildings to meet high energy
standards.
   Founded in 1977, the alliance is a non-profit coalition of
business, government and consumer leaders dedicated to increasing
the efficiency of energy use. The alliance conducts research, pilot
projects, education programs and policy advocacy.

   Record-setting temperatures have added to the
ear-splitting noise that afflicts residents of some suburbs near
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``The hot, dry air is holding the noise closer to the ground,''
said Roddy Coker, supervisor at the Federal Aviation Administration
control tower at O'Hare. ``And in hot weather, airplanes don't
climb as fast as they do in cold weather. That's just a fact.''
   Residents in Des Plaines, Park Ridge and Bloomingdale have been
flooding the office of the O'Hare Citizen's Coalition with
complaints about jet noise, said Director Matthew Rosenberg.
   ``People are at their wits end,'' Rosenberg said Monday. ``It
was bad enough before, but it's worse now.''
   The temperature hit 97 at O'Hare on Tuesday, breaking the record
for June 21 of 95 degrees set in 1968. On Monday, the temperature
at O'Hare hit 104 _ 1 degree short of the highest temperature in
Chicago since the weather service began keeping records.
   O'Hare authorities also said that because one runway at the
airport is closed for resurfacing, more planes have been using a
runway that heads toward the suburbs.

<HEAD>Advisers To Black Teen-Ager Deny Bugging Story and Assert
Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAYNER PIKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advisers to a black teen-ager who said she
was assaulted by six white men last fall denied Tuesday a claim
that one adviser hired someone to tape his conversations with the
other two.
   Samuel McClease, who said he was hired by the Rev. Al Sharpton
to bug lawyer C. Vernon Mason, said his tapes showed that the
advisers didn't believe the story told by teen-ager, Tawana
Brawley, but that the three were using her case for personal gain.
   Mason, Sharpton and lawyer Alton Maddox asserted during a
two-hour interview Tuesday that McClease was lying and that he did
not have the ability to carry out a secret electronic surveillance.
   On the other hand, they said McClease was forced by some law
enforcement organization to plant the bugs to make Sharpton look
bad and destroy the unity of the Brawley advisers.
   They accused WCBS television, which broke the bugging story
Monday, of ``corruption and racism'' for not checking McClease's
credibility before putting him on the air.
   The three men made their allegations on WLIB radio. They would
not talk to reporters afterward.
   No tape of the purported bugging was broadcast by WCBS during
its interview with McClease. Asked whether it had such tape, the
station issued a statement that said: ``We're confident that the
tapes exist and that the story will continue to unfold.''
   Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls, and her family have
refused to cooperate with the grand jury, which state Attorney
General Robert Abrams said has been stymied in trying to learn what
happened during the four days last November when Miss Brawley said
she was kidnapped and raped by six white men, one of whom had a
badge.
   The three advisers contend the investigation has fallen prey to
racism, and say black people cannot get justice in New York state.
The teen-ager's mother has been in a church since last week, when
she sought refuge to avoid arrest for contempt for refusing to
cooperate with the grand jury.

<TEXT>
   An Arab man accused of driving a car
containing explosives aboard an Israeli-bound ferry will appear in
court Wednesday on illegal arms possession charges, the government
announced.
   A Merchant Marine Ministry statement issued Tuesday identified
the suspect as Omar Mohammed Sofrini and said he carried a West
German passport.
   It said a car allegedly driven by Sofrini aboard the ferry
Paloma in the Athens' port of Piraeus contained a revolver equipped
with a silencer, 101 bullets, 19 bottles packed with explosives and
detonators.
   Sofrini is being held in Piraeus pending his court appearance,
according to the statement.
   The explosives were discovered by port authorities and Israeli
security officials on Monday shortly before the 3,895-ton Paloma
was to set sail with 400 passengers and 100 crew members. Also on
the Cyriot-registered ship were about 200 cars, Piraeus officials
reported.
   They said the vessel departed Monday, about four hours later,
for the voyage to the islands of Rhodes and Cyprus and then to
Haifa, Israel.
   The ministry statement said Sofrini arrived in Greece June 18
after driving the car from West Germany through Austria and
Yugoslavia.
   Ilias Trochidis, owner of the ferry company Afroessa Lines, told
The Associated Press by telephone that Sofrini, about 30 years old,
was asleep in his cabin when the explosives were found.
   ``He said he'd just bought the car and didn't know anything
about the explosives,'' Trochidis said.
   An Afroessa Lines official said the Paloma ``had Israelis, a few
Americans, quite a number of British, some Greeks, Greek Cypriots
and Scandinavians aboard.'' About 100 passengers were traveling to
Haifa, the official said, but he did not know where Sofrini had
planned to disembark.
   The Paloma makes weekly journeys between Piraeus and Haifa.
Piraeus port authority officials and Israeli security agents
routinely search the vessel.
   Trochidis said the explosives were found in the car's wheel
wells.
   It was the second arrest in Greece this month of a terrorist
suspect.
   On June 1, a Palestinian identified as Mohammed Rashid was
picked up at the Athens airport by police who said they had
received information from the U.S. Embassy.
   The United States has asked for Rashid's extradition, accusing
him of involvement in a 1982 bombing aboard a Pan American World
Airways jetliner over Honolulu that killed one person and injured
15 people.
   Rashid also is suspected of being connected with a 1986
explosion on a Trans World Airlines jet over Greece that killed
four people.

<HEAD>State Department Says Authoritative PLO Statement Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestine Liberation Organization official's
ideas about peacefully settling disputes with Israel contain ``a
constructive tone'' and ``some positive points,'' but lack
authoritative backing from the PLO leadership, the State Department
said Tuesday.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley was commenting on a paper
circulated to journalists at the Arab summit meeting earlier this
month in Algiers and attributed to Bassam Abu Sharif, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's Tunis-based adviser.
   The summit announced financial support for the current uprising
by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, while Abu
Sharif's material talked of Israelis and Palestinians living side
by side in peace and cooperation.
   It suggested direct peace talks and an internationally
supervised referendum on the West Bank and Gaza Strip to establish
whether the PLO should represent Palestinians.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy, told a news
conference in Saudi Arabia last weekend that the paper lacked the
``strident rhetoric'' of other Palestinian statements and
represented a ``contribution to a rational discussion'' of the
Middle East problem.
   He also noted that no Israeli ``would sit down with the PLO in
the present conditions'' of that organization's non-recognition of
Israel.
   Asked to comment, Mrs. Oakley said the big question is how
authoritative is the Algiers statement. ``Does it represent
official PLO policy?'' she asked, then added:
   ``We note the constructive tone which the article conveys in
general, as well as some positive points. If the PLO is serious
about moderating its position so as to make a practical condition
to the peace process, it can do so in an authoritative way. We have
yet to see such an authoritative statement.''

<HEAD>More Record Heat, Thunderstorms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record heat continued Tuesday across the Plains and Midwest
today, with record highs in dozens of cities from the Dakotas to
the East Coast. Thunderstorms cropped up around the Great Lakes and
the Gulf Coast.
   Early afternoon temperatures were higher than at the same Monday
over much of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and
eastward to the middle Atlantic states.
   It was only the third time that Milwaukee reached 100 degrees
during the past 33 years. The temperature at Rochester, Minn.,
reached 90 degrees for the seventh time this year, and rose to 97;
in a normal year, 90 is reached only six times.
   At Rockford, Ill., the temperature reached 100 degrees for the
second day in a row, the first time that had happened since 1947.
   The Great Lakes region will receive at least some relief from
the heat during the next few days after a cold front moves slowly
south and reaches the Chicago area late Wednesday, with some
thunderstorms breaking out ahead of the front.
   Thunderstorms developed Tuesday across parts of Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   Thunderstorms also popped up over sections of Florida, the Gulf
coastal states and coastal Texas.
   More thunderstorms developed over sections of the central and
southern Appalachians and over parts of the Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 107 at both Hill City, Kan.,
and Tucson, Ariz. The low for the day was 42 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo., and Truckee, Calif.
   For Wednesday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from northern New England across New York and the Great Lakes
region to Iowa and northern Missouri. Showers and thunderstorms
also were forecast from the southern Atlantic states and Florida
across the Gulf Coast states to southern Texas. Widely scattered
afternoon thunderstorms were forecast across sections of eastern
California to sections of the Rockies.
   Highs only in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific
Coast; in the 70s and 80s from northern Michigan across Minnesota
to North Dakota, and over the Pacific Northwest; in the 80s from
southeastern Louisiana to Florida, and over much of New England and
New York state; between 100 and 110 over Kansas, sections of
southwestern Idaho and the desert Southwest; and in the 90s to near
100 over most of the nation.

   World leaders agreed Tuesday to do more to lift
the tremendous foreign debt burdens shouldered by the poorest
countries but made no new effort to help the giant debtors of Latin
America.
   In their final communique, the seven leaders attending the
annual economic summit of industrialized nations backed a plan
offering a variety of options, including slashing interest rates
and forgiving some loans, to ease the debt load of mostly poor
countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the fresh move
offers ``a message of hope to the poorest countries.''
   ``I think it's very important news for countries in a very
difficult position,'' he told reporters.
   But the leaders said the debt problems of the so-called
``middle-income'' countries, like Brazil and Mexico, should be
handled on a ``case-by-case'' basis, a strategy fashioned in recent
years to deal individually with these debtors.
   The leaders acknowledged that the big debtors ``continue to have
difficulties servicing their external debt and generating the
investment necessary for sustainable growth.''
   But they said, ``The market-oriented, growth-led strategy based
on the case-by-case approach remains the only viable approach for
overcoming their external debt problems.''
   Brazil and Mexico, the developing world's largest debtors, have
foreign debts totaling a combined $220 billion.
   The 44 countries that make up sub-Saharan Africa rang up debts
of about $120 billion at the end of 1987, according to the
International Monetary Fund.
   The total foreign debt of the developing world is estimated at
approximately $1 trillion.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., said the
leaders' action ``looks like really more of the same.'' ``It's a
constructive window-dressing statement on what is a totally
intractable situation,'' he said.
   ``There is no way at any summit that what in reality remains an
albatross around the world's neck can be resolved,'' he said.
   Sally Shelton-Colby, an international financial consultant in
Washington, D.C., said the she doubted the new African plan would
have ``any appreciable effect'' on the debt problem.
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' she said, ``but I don't
think the importance of it should be exaggerated.''
   She was skeptical that the Reagan administration in its seven
remaining months in office would take advantage of the new program.
   ``I can't imagine the Reagan administration granting meaningful
debt relief to the poorest of the poor countries,'' she said.
   ``It's not a high priority,'' she said.
   The Reagan administration backed off from its previous refusal
to go along with debt concessions, enabling the summit leaders to
adopt the fresh measures.
   The plan for the poorest debtors calls for the creditor
countries to reschedule the ``official debt of these countries
within a framework of comparability,'' the leaders' statement said.
   The governments, it said, would have several options for easing
the debt burdens.
   They include reducing interest rates on shorter-term loans,
extending repayment periods at higher, market interest rates,
partially writing off loans, or a combination of these options.
   ``This approach allows official creditors to choose options
consistent with their legal or budgetary constraints,'' the
statement said.
   The United States has said it cannot legally write off loans or
grant concessionary interest rates, but can extend interest
repayment periods.
   The program would apply only to official or government debt and
not to loans incurred from commercial banks.
   Beregovoy said that to qualify for the relief package, a country
must have a very low per-capita income and be following economic
policies approved by the International Monetary Fund.
   Moreover, a country's annual debt payments must eat up 30
percent of its earnings from export sales.
   Beregovoy estimated that 30 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan
Africa but a few in Asia, would qualify.
   He estimated that roughly $10 billion to $15 billion of the
countries' total debts would fall under the program.
   The total cost to France, he said, would be about $130 million
year.
   Details of the plan are to be worked out by the end of the year
by the Paris Club, a group of 17 Western creditor countries which
renegotiates debt owed them.
   Prior to the summit, French President Francois Mitterrand and
Nigel Lawson, Britain's top financial officer, urged relief for
these countries.
   Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, offered a complicated
plan to help the bigger debtor countries but no action was taken on
that.
   Several officials complained of not having enough time to study
the Japanese proposal, which calls for the debtors to deposit some
of their international reserves with the International Monetary
Fund.
   The plan, while not accepted at the summit, will certainly
prompt more discussion at later meetings.

<HEAD>Safety Officials Urge Wider Drug Testing of Railroad Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal safety board urged broader testing
for drugs among railroad workers Tuesday when drug use is
suspected, but the panel did not endorse a far-ranging random
testing program for the industry as urged by the Transportation
Department.
   The National Transportation Safety Board called on the federal
government and industry to step up its programs aimed at finding
drug users among railroad workers. It said last year 29 railroad
accidents involved some drug or alcohol use and in 10 cases the use
was linked directly to the cause of the accident.
   A Federal Railroad Administration rule which went into effect in
early 1987 requires drug tests to be performed after an accident,
but the rule applies only to accidents involving a fatality or more
than $500,000 damage.
   The NTSB said the requirement for such tests should be broadened
to any accident involving an injury or damage of $150,000 and also
be required whenever a persons's work habits or actions _ such as
chronic absenteeism _ indicates an alcohol or drug problem.
   The safety board also said the Federal Railroad Administration
should require railroad employees involved in safety-related jobs
to obtain medical certificates and undergo periodic medical tests
that include drug screening.
   The safety board has no authority to impose such requirements
and may only make recommendations to the FRA and the railroad
industry.
   The board praised the FRA's post-accident drug and alcohol
testing requirements, but urged that they be broadened to include
more workers, including supervisors whose actions might be
connected with an accident.
   It also called for tests to be conducted more quickly after an
accident, saying in some cases last year workers were not tested
for 13 hours to 26 hours after an accident.
   The Transportation Department has proposed a wideranging drug
testing requirement for the railroad industry. It currently is
going through the public hearing stages before being developed into
a final regulation.
   The department's proposal includes random testing for drugs
among railroad employees. The safety board, however, has not
endorsed the random testing approach.
   NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett said Tuesday that for random tests to
be effective far more tests would have to be required than
currently is being planned.
   He said the government and industry would be more successful in
ridding railroads of drug problems ``by targeting tests'' toward
those workers who are suspected of drug use through their actions
or involvement in work rule violations or accidents.

<HEAD>Warplanes Attack Positions On Front; Iranian Rebels Hold Mehran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Iraq said they launched air
attacks on each other's battlefield positions Tuesday, while
Iranian rebels fought to hang on to a shattered border town they
took over the weekend.
   The Iraq-based rebels, known as the National Liberation Army,
said they killed or wounded 8,000 Iranian soldiers in Sunday's
battle for Mehran, 100 miles east of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.
They said several women were among 57 of their fighters who died.
   A rebel communique said women were on the front lines, where
they were deployed as mortar crews giving cover fire for advancing
troops. The communique was sent by telex to The Associated Press in
Nicosia.
   The communique said rebel forces on Tuesday held foohills north
and south of Mehran and the highway to Dehloran, 75 miles to the
south in Iran.
   Iran, which has said Iraqi forces took Mehran, said its air
force flew eight sorties against Iraqi positions around the town.
   The bombing and artillery duels killed enemy soldiers, destroyed
vehicles and set fortifications on fire, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said in a war communique monitored in Nicosia.
   Iraq and the rebels deny any Iraqi troops took part.
   The Iranian air force also made four bombing runs against Iraqi
positions in northern Sulimaniyeh province, IRNA said. The news
agency also reported fighting on the ground between Iraqi troops
and Kurds opposed to the Baghdad government fighting next to
Iranian soldiers. The two sides have been battling for mountain
peaks in the region.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said that during fighting in the
north, its ground forces shot down an Iranian F-5 Tuesday morning.
Iran had no immediate comment.
   Iraq said its air force flew 313 combat missions Tuesday and
lost no aircraft. INA said the total included 84 combat missions by
jet fighters and 229 by helicopter gunships.
   The continued high total in gunship missions indicates the two
sides are locked in heavy ground fighting, as Iraq uses helicopters
to counter Iranian force on the ground.
   The National Liberation Army's hold on Mehran since Sunday is
the longest time the rebel force has spent inside Iran since it
formed a year ago. Its previous pattern has been to inflict as much
damage as possible and withdraw. The group has said it does not
intend to keep its fighters around Mehran.
   Iran and Iraq, locked in a nearly 8-year-old war, have each
captured and lost Mehran several times.
   The Iranian casualties claimed by the rebels could not be
independently confirmed. But reporters saw more than 1,500 Iranian
prisoners brought across the border to Badrah on Monday.
   The rebels did not say how many fighters were committed to the
battle for Mehran, but the assault force involved an estimated
several thousand men and women along a 30-mile front.
   In the northern Persian Gulf, shipping executives said a U.S.
and a French warship rushed to help a small boat that put out a
distress signal late Tuesday in the same area where Iran attacked
two commercial vessels two weeks ago.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
later learned the boat was simply taking water in the engine room.
They identified it as the Nada and said its Greek crew of six
radioed they were abandoning the vessel in life rafts near the
Saudi Arabian oil terminal of Ras Tanura.
   The executives said they did not know which U.S. and French
warships were involved. The U.S. Navy recently has said it would
help neutral vessels, regardless of which flag they fly, if
attacked in the vicinity of a U.S. warship.
   Iran attacks neutral shipping in retaliation for Iraqi attacks
on Iranian-chartered vessels.

<HEAD>Summit Fails to Make Sweeping Changes on Farm Subsidies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders at the economic summit on Tuesday
rejected President Reagan's plan to reform bloated farm subsidy
programs after European and Japanese leaders refused to make
sweeping promises on cutting the support payments.
   The farm issue proved the most divisive of the generally
harmonious three-day summit. Even Britain, the most reform-minded
of the West European nations, dismissed the Reagan plan as
``totally unrealistic.''
   The president, attending his final summit session, appeared
undaunted even though his colleagues had spurned his plea for
change.
   Reagan acknowledged that ``there are some differences of
opinion'' on the subsidies question, but added, ``I am not going to
give up on that.''
   The final communique issued Tuesday fell well short of the
signal for urgent action some U.S. officials had hoped to send to
the crucial General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks in
December in Montreal.
   The summit leaders effectively ignored the Reagan proposal,
which called for the elimination of all farm subsidies by the year
2000. Instead, the communique said the countries should work simply
for a reduction of the support payments to farmers.
   Many officials agree that the payments pose a problem, since
they drain national treasuries of nearly $200 billion a year,
encourage huge surpluses and harm the trade prospects of
agriculture-dependent Third World economies.
   But many also contend that drastic reform of the system would be
politically untenable.
   The communique said the leaders supported both the ``framework''
approach of trying to find an overall solution, favored by the
Americans, and also the short-term measures which Britain, France,
West Germany, Italy and Japan feel are the most that can be
achieved. Canada, the host, had sought a compromise.
   ``The mid-term review will provide a unique opportunity to send
a credible political signal to the trading world,'' said the
communique.
   ``We suport efforts to adopt a framework approach, including
short as well as long term elements which will promote the reform
process ... and relieve current strains in the agricultural
markets,'' the communique said.
   At their final meeting Tuesday morning, the seven leaders
slightly strengthened the vague language on farm subsidies. The
communique said the trade negotiators ``must'' _ as opposed to
``should'' in the draft communique composed by officials _ take
both short-term options and long-term goals.
   But the leaders, in a communique-approving session that ran an
hour over the scheduled two hours, also included another escape
clause by drawing attention to ``the diversity of our agricultural
situations.''
   Britain, for example, has few farmers, most of whom are
efficient and wealthy. West Germany and France have electorally
important lobbies of smalltime farmers who depend heavily on
subsidies.
   The communique also said subsidy cutbacks must take account of
``social concerns.''
   According to figures produced by the 24-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan has the most heavily
subsidized system, offering a 75 percent subsidy for its
agriculture in 1986, up from 54 percent in 1980.
   European Economic Community subsidies totaled 49 percent in
1986, up from 36 percent in 1980, and U.S. subsidies were 35
percent, up from 15 percent.
   The EEC, to which the four European nations at the summit
belong, agreed to far-reaching measures last spring designed to
impose permanent curbs on production through automatic subsidy
cutoff when farmers exceed quotas.
   But officials note the agreement will only slow down increases
in subsidies, rather than impose an immediate freeze.
   ``It is the right of everyone to have expectations, even great
expectations, but it is not very productive to be dreaming without
reality,'' Willy de Clerq, the EEC foreign affairs commissioner,
said of the deadlock.

   Leslie Manigat said
Tuesday he would try to rally world opposition to the military
establishment that ousted him as president of Haiti, but expressed
little hope of returning to power.
   He told a news conference in the Dominican Republic, which
shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, that he had
telephoned foreign leaders and international organizations
requesting support.
   Manigat said he believed the government Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
announced Monday was fragile ``because the armed forces' cohesion
behind Gen. Namphy is artificial and temporary.''
   The former political science professor added, however, that the
end of his 4-month-old government meant the army had ``won a
point'' in the contest between military and civilian rule.
   About his personal plans, he said:
   ``I'm not going to fall into the classic trap of deposed
political men who see the return to power from one moment to the
other and pass all their time waiting for that imminent return. I'm
not only a politician, but a political scientist. I can avoid that
vision, that force of mistaken politics and personal frustration.
   ``I don't have any bitterness, nor personal rancor. I am sad for
my country, for my people and for Haitian democracy.''
   Manigat, 57, claimed widespread corruption in the military led
to the coup, which occurred after he took sides in what appeared to
be an internal military conflict.
   He said he had tried to bring reforms to Haiti, but the military
undercut him and democratic elements did not support his
government. Opposition political leaders claim fraud in the Jan. 17
election, which Manigat won with the army's help.
   ``My government has been overthrown for specific reasons: the
resistance and reaction of various powerful interests to my action
of struggle against the corruption and against smuggling'' in the
military, he said.
   ``My government represented the only and final chance for
democracy. The other democratic sectors have understood that too
late and it was their political mistake to refuse the public
support that would have ... strengthened my government.''
   The coup sprang from ``the unilateral initiative of Gen.
Namphy,'' he said.
   Namphy ``and his friends were openly criticizing the
administrative reform that I was developing to re-establish
administrative honesty and to clean up the public administration
and the public service sector,'' Manigat told reporters.
   He said the general ``was irritated by seeing me revoke his
corrupt friends placed in key positions of the public
administration.'' He said those friends turned to Namphy for help
and eventually ``constituted a hostile climate, even a hostile
network, against my government.''
   Security problems in the country were ``the work, in great
measure, of the sectors inside the armed forces themselves,''
Manigat said.

   Soviet officials told Western diplomats Tuesday
that exit visas will be granted to a Jewish family President Reagan
considered visiting during the Moscow summit.
   Reagan had cancelled the visit for fear of dooming the family's
chance to emigrate.
   The informal notice passed by Soviet Foreign Ministry officials
to diplomats in Moscow, Washington and Canberra, Australia,
signaled an about-face in the case of Yuri and Tanya Zieman. A week
ago the Ziemans were officially informed their appeal for
permission to leave the country had been rejected.
   Mrs. Zieman said Tuesday she had heard the reports from
Australian and other diplomats, but she had no indication from
Soviet authorities that her family's 11-year quest for exit visas
was at an end.
   An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the U.S. government had been informed ``at the level
of a senior officer'' that the Zieman case was about to be
resolved. He refused to be more specific.
   The Ziemans' 12-year-old daughter, Vera, who calls herself ``a
lifelong refusenik,'' had appealed to the president and Mrs. Reagan
for help in gaining visas. The Reagans considered visiting her at
the family's three-room apartment in southwest Moscow during their
trip to Moscow three weeks ago.
   But Soviet officials sent word they would regard it as a direct
insult to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev if the Reagans visited
him in the Kremlin and then stopped by the Zieman home. One said
the Reagans would be ``behaving as if they had two hosts'' for the
official visit.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Bessmertnykh had told U.S.
Ambassador Jack F. Matlock that if the Reagans visited the Ziemans
the family would never be permitted to leave the country.
   The president called off the visit but the Ziemans did attend a
tea the Reagans gave for people the U.S. administration considers
victims of Soviet human rights abuses. Vera, a pianist, recently
received a gift from the Reagans of music tapes.
   Yuri Zieman, a computer specialist who lost his job when he
applied to emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken
several months ago by a brain ailment that has left him with double
vision and a loss of balance.
   The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as a
potentially deadly enlargement of an artery, made the family's
quest more urgent because Zieman was advised by his doctors not to
undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the Soviet Union.
   Zieman has been told he was not permitted to leave the country
for security reasons, although he contends he never had access to
state secrets and has no information that could threaten Soviet
security.
   The Ziemans have an older daughter who was permitted to emigrate
last year with her husband. They now live in the Boston area.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Ruling May Force Disclosure Of Financial Inducements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment tip sheets can be forced to tell
readers that they were given financial inducements by a company to
print an article touting the firm's stock, a federal appeals court
ruled Thursday.
   But the court rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission's
contention such publications must tell readers that a featured
company provided the article or paid the writer who composed it.
   Deciding whether the text of a particular article was
``substantially provided'' by the company would be an intrusion in
the editorial process that is prohibited by the First Amendment,
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled.
   The court, however, revived a lawsuit by the SEC to force Stock
Market Magazine to tell readers if feature articles about companies
were carried as a result of other financial inducements.
   These arrangements could include a company's agreement to buy
advertising in the publication or purchase reprints of the feature
article, the court said in an opinion by Circuit Judge Laurence
Silberman.
   The SEC had sought the injunction to enforce the anti-touting
provisions of the 1933 Securities Act, which were designed to
prohibit publication of investment tips under the guise of
journalism by people with a financial interest in a stock's value.
   The case was sent back to U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson
Jr., who had thrown out the SEC's suit First Amendment grounds, to
determine if the existence of such ``quid pro quo'' financial
arrangements warranted an injuction against the monthly magazine.
   ``If they did exist, we have no doubt that an injunction could
be fashioned to require disclosure when consideration is paid in
this distinct form, without trameling fully protected speech or
interfering with editorial practices,'' Silberman wrote in an
opinion joined by Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg. Judge Carl
McGowan, the panel's third member who had concurred in the opinion,
died last December.
   ``Requiring disclosure of such payments would not interfere with
either editorial judgments concerning the content of the feature
articles or news gathering practices,'' Silberman said.
   But the court said such interference would occur if the SEC
sought to require disclosure that the article was planted by the
company either by providing a free copy of the text or paying a
free-lance journalist to write it.
   That ``would result in both the SEC and court interference with
the `crucial process' of editorial control, interference that the
Supreme Court has decried as particularly repugnant to core First
Amendment concerns,'' Silberman wrote.
   The magazine's attorney, Joseph H. Sharlitt said his client's
``First Amendment position has been vindicated.''
   But Sharlitt said the court's decision ``gives the SEC the right
to look at the financial records of the financial press and compare
that with the content of its articles and make a determination
whether there has been some sort of tie-in deal.''
   Under this decision, the SEC could enjoin publication of a
magazine on the basis of one article that was printed as a result
of a financial inducement, he said.
   Sharlitt denied the SEC's allegations that Stock Market Magazine
received financial inducements to print the articles.
   He said he was unsure whether the magazine had legal standing to
appeal the decision because the SEC had not obtained an injunction
against it.
   Richard Kirby, the SEC's assistant general counsel, said the
decision was ``significant in the respect we can clearly now
enforce the statute in certain important respects.''

<HEAD>House Members Seeking To Prevent Construction Of Shopping Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members on Tuesday vowed to increase
efforts to prevent construction of a massive shopping center
adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   ``We're really a case of last resort here,'' Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, told a House panel. ``We're either going to save the
battlefield, or let a developer literally put one of the nation's
biggest shopping malls right next door.''
   ``I'm interested in coming up with a policy for these matters,''
said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who chairs the Interior and Insular
Affairs subcommittee on national parks and public lands. ``The
preservation of resources is a priority of the National Park
Service.''
   Congress became involved in the development dispute after local
opponents of the project charged that government officials and
builders in Prince William County, Va., tricked them by first
proposing a small office park and then switching to a 1.2 million
square foot mall.
   The battlefield, located 27 miles west of Washington, D.C., was
the site of the first significant land battle of the Civil War. A
surprising Confederate triumph in that 1861 fight helped convince
Union leaders that the war would be a protracted affair.
   The second battle, fought over a three-day span in August 1862,
saw a bloody, decisive Confederate victory that set the stage for
Rebel attacks on the North.
   The present fight centers around a 542-acre tract adjacent to
the federally run park where developers first proposed building the
mall. They agreed to move the mall some 600 feet after historians
noted that a hill in the middle of the disputed land was the site
from which Gen. Robert E. Lee directed Confederate forces in the
second Battle of Manassas.
   That single concession, however, has not satisfied opponents,
who charge that the construction of a mall that large will forever
destroy the sanctity of the still-rural area where 20,000
casualties were recorded in the second contest.
   Andrews and Rep Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., have introduced
legislation that would direct the Interior Department to purchase
the disputed tract and add it to the park, while Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., has proposed that Congress buy the land directly, a faster
move than waiting up to 10 years for the federal agency to act.
Both measures would also close roads now running through the
battlefields.
   Wolf also wants the federal government to pay for construction
of new highways around the 4,600-acre battlefield park, which
Virginia state highway officials say would cost $101 million.

   The United States is trying to transform the
annual summit of Western industrialized countries into a permanent
body that would try to run the world, President Francois Mitterrand
of France said Tuesday.
   Mitterrand, who clashed repeatedly with President Reagan during
the three-day meeting, said he objected to a plan for an
international seven-nation drug task force because he considered it
the latest American attempt to establish a new organization.
   ``In whose name do these seven countries decide for the rest of
the world?'' asked Mitterrand, who was re-elected last month to a
second seven-year term.
   Speaking to reporters, he criticized what he called ``the
tendency or strategy of the United States to transform this summit
into a permanent institution, leaving each time organizations which
would continue from one year to another. This I refuse.''
   Ultimately, France abstained on a paragraph of Monday's
political declaration which welcomed the U.S. proposal for a drug
task force, but without specifying what countries might be members.
   Mitterrand said his confrontations with Reagan on this and other
issues _ farm subsidies and aid to the Philippines _ ``did not
exceed reasonable bounds.''
   The dispute over whether to single out the Philippines as a
fragile democracy deserving financial support came Tuesday morning
at the summit's final session, delaying its conclusion by about an
hour.
   Mitterrand said many other countries were in much the same
position of the Philippines, which was only singled out for U.S.
strategic and political reasons.
   ``I spoke of Argentina,'' Mitterrand said, noting that there,
too, a government was threatened after replacing a dictatorship and
was suffering under an economic burden that could menace the
survival of democracy.
   Mitterrand, who will be the host of next year's summit meeting,
said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas suggested the compromise
that was adopted, noting that countries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America deserved help to preserve democracy, but naming only the
Philippines.
   On farm subsidies, where Reagan failed to win support for their
elimination in the next decade, Mitterrand said it was not a
France-U.S. confrontation because several European countries joined
him in opposition.
   Mitterrand, the only Socialist in a group of otherwise
conservative national leaders at the summit, said he had spoken up
to note that his peers who praised effusively the unfettered free
market were also pleased that international cooperation had
``limited the effects of this false liberty'' after the October
market crash.
   ``There's a little contradiction between the hymn to free-market
doctrine and what has just happened,'' he said.
   Mitterrand, 71, has attended the last eight summits, just as
Reagan has. But while Reagan prepares to retire, Mitterrand's new
term runs until 1995.
   The French president said he had no objection to the warm praise
for Reagan offered by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at the
end of the summit.
   ``For someone who played a great role in contemporary history,
it's normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy and
long. It's a courtesy,'' Mitterrand said. ``It has nothing to do, I
suppose, with politics.''

   Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign is
conducting public polling to gauge the strength of potential
Democratic vice presidential candidates and has requested
background information from Jesse Jackson and at least one other
contender, sources said Tuesday.
   At the same time, sources said Paul Brountas, Dukakis' close
friend who is guiding the search for a running mate, received
advice in Congress last week to steer clear of Jackson, who
finished second in several primaries and caucuses and will have the
support of more than 1,100 delegates at the party convention.
   Several officials said Brountas was advised to balance the
ticket with a moderate or conservative Democrat, preferably from
the South or West.
   ``He was told, `You can basically write it off in terms of the
election if you pick Jackson,'' said one member of Congress who
attended one of several sessions that Dukakis' adviser held.
   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in
addition to Jackson, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida has been asked to
supply financial and other background information. Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, who also has been mentioned frequently as a
possible running mate, has not yet received such a request, his
office said.
   Brountas met with numerous Democrats during his visit to
Washington, including Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., Jackson's lone
supporter in the Senate.
   ``I provided information about everybody else except me,''
Hollings said thorugh an aide.
   In his meetings with congressional Democrats, Brountas was urged
repeatedly to balance the Democratic ticket with someone who can
attract votes in the South and West, said several sources,
including one congressman who attended a session with him.
   ``He was advised to select somebody who has broad appeal and to
keep himself loose from any commitment for Jesse Jackson at this
point,'' said the congressman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Brountas' reaction was described as non-committal.
   This congressman and others said Brountas also was urged to find
a running mate who would bring experience on defense issues and
foreign policy to the ticket.
   ``The focus is on the South and on defense and foreign policy,''
areas of expertise that are in short supply on Dukakis' resume,
said a congressional aide whose boss was one of several Senate and
House members to meet with Brountas last week. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Dukakis campaign officials refused to discuss the search for a
running mate. ``We're in the process of gathering information,''
said Leslie Dach, the campaign's communications director. Dukakis
has said little on the subject, although he has said he wants to
make up his mind before the week of the Democratic National
Convention.
   Relatively few names have been circulating lately as potential
running mates for Dukakis, who has wrapped up enough delegates to
be assured of a first-ballot nomination at the convention next
month. The list includes Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Graham and Bradley and Reps. Tom
Foley of Washington and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Jackson has been mounting a public campaign in hopes of being
offered the vice presidential spot, but public polls in a number of
states indicate he would hurt the ticket. Thus, Dukakis' aides
generally do not believe that the runner-up in the primary season
will wind up with the vice presidential nomination.
   Nor is a woman deemed likely to join the Democratic ticket.
Unlike 1984, when a concerted campaign by Democratic women preceded
Geraldine Ferraro's selection as Walter F. Mondale's running mate,
there has been no such public clamor this year. And while Brountas
met with Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland last week while in
Washington, her name has not surfaced as a possible running mate,
nor has any other woman member of Congress.
   The search for a running mate is beind carried out as quietly as
possible, and campaign officials are working to keep the public
focus on other issues.
   To that end, Dukakis is undertaking an unusually heavy period of
post-primary campaign travel in the weeks leading up to the
convention, in hopes of generating newspaper and television stories
that dwell on something other than the vice presidential search.
   And when Brountas visited Congress last week, the campaign
insisted that aides be banned from meetings, a request that helps
minimize leaks to reporters.
   Even so, sources said that in some of the meetings, Dukakis'
emissary was urged to look for a moderate or conservative candidate
who will be able to attract support in the South and the West,
areas of the country where Democrats have run poorly in recent
elections.
   In addition, he was urged to find a running mate who would
provide experience in defense and foreign policy issues that would
compensate for Dukakis' relative lack of experience in those areas.
Dukakis' only experience in public service has been as a legislator
and as governor of Massachusetts.
   While little information was available on Dukakis' vice
presidential polling, public surveys that are available provide a
glimpse of how the selection of a running mate could affect the
race.
   A survey published in Florida based on interviews conducted in
early May reported Bush held a lead of 61 percent to 24 percent
over a hypothetical Democratic ticket of Dukakis and Jackson.
   When Nunn was listed as Democratic vice presidential candidate
in the survey, Bush's margin slipped to 46 percent to 39 percent.
   When Nunn was replaced by Florida's home-state Sen. Bob Graham,
the Democrats had 46 percent support to 44 percent for Bush.

<HEAD>L.A. Lawyer Breaks Sex Barrier at New York Friar's Club</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Los Angeles lawyer who specialized in sex
discrimination cases, Gloria Allred, broke an 84-year-old sex
barrier at the Friar's Club Tuesday, but only after an impromptu
Friar's roast by a member, comedian Henny Youngman.
   ``Some people bring happiness wherever they go; she brings
happiness whenever she goes,'' Youngman grumbled as Ms. Allred, a
member of the Beverly Hills Friar's Club, was admitted for lunch to
the formerly all-male New York club.
   Ms. Allred said she caught a midnight flight from Los Angeles to
New York after hearing Monday that the U.S. Supreme Court had
upheld a New York City law barring sex discrimination by private
clubs.
   ``It is time to end the exclusionary and discriminatory policy
of the New York Friar's Club, which severely restricts the right of
women to do business on an equal basis with men,'' she said in a
news conference outside the mid-Manhattan club before being
admitted.
   All eyes turned when Youngman, a member of the club for more
than 50 years, appeared at the door and interrupted Ms. Allred's
question-and-answer session.
   ``I don't think they ought to butt in in our business,'' the
comedian said. ``If we want privacy, we ought to have privacy. ...
There's a million clubs in New York. Why do they want to get in? We
have fun here.''
   When Ms. Allred tried to argue with him, Youngman brushed her
off, saying, ``I don't know who you are.''
   She finally slipped past him and into the club, saying, ``Nice
to have met you, sir. You're entitled to be wrong.''
   Once inside, she dined on poached salmon and zucchini and was
joined by the executive director of the club, Jean Pierre Trebot.
   ``It went very well,'' she said afterward. ``I enjoyed the lunch
very much.''
   Trebot said the decision to admit Ms. Allred was made after the
Supreme Court ruling Monday. He said the club's Board of Governors
will vote on whether to admit women as regular members. ``We expect
it will be affirmative,'' he said.
   The Friar's Club, founded in 1904, has 1,360 members in New
York, two-thirds of whom are active in the performing arts. Its top
officer, called the abbot, is Frank Sinatra; other members include
George Burns and Irving Berlin.
   The Friar's policy until Tuesday was to admit women only after 4
p.m. or for lunch on Saturdays.
   Ms. Allred successfully fought for admission to the Beverly
Hills club in May 1987 and had been trying since last fall to be
admitted to the New York club under a policy of reciprocity between
the two organizations.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations, which is on the edge
of financial ruin, is spending $7.4 million on the special session
on disarmament that ends this week.
   A budget document obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press
estimates the costs of the four-week General Assembly session at
$4.17 million; a series of preparatory sessions at $2.67 million
and U.N. payments for travel by delegates from the poorest nations
at $556,500.
   The document, dating from November 1986, took estimates of
inflation into account and provided figures in anticipated 1988
dollar values.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said special-session costs are
paid out of the regular U.N. budget, which is about $800 million
this year. She also noted the United Nations may not spend all the
funds allocated for the session.
   Last Friday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the
United Nations could close down by late October if member nations
do not pay the $691 million in overdue membership fees.
   The United States has withheld $467 million over several years
insisting the organization cut its staff and adopt budget reforms.
   The AP had requested information on the cost of the session that
has been attended by delegates from more than 86 of the 159 U.N.
member nations.
   Many delegation leaders addressed the assembly, and all of the
groups are presenting position papers and news releases in a
blizzard of documents.
   The largest single budget item for the session is for
documentation _ $1.18 million. Verbatim records of the sessions
were estimated to cost $1.09 million and translations $920,000.
   Preparatory meetings included a two-week committee session in
1987 budgeted at $633,800 and two committee meetings in 1988
costing $1.074 million and $966,000.
   The session is scheduled to end Saturday with the adoption of
resolutions on nuclear, chemical, conventional and spaced-based
weapons. No breakthroughs are expected with the final document, to
be adopted by consensus.
   America and most of its Western allies are seeking a modest
resolution dealing with progress in disarmament talks and avoiding
emphasis on nuclear disarmament.
   The Soviet Union made a sweeping proposal to eliminate all
nuclear arms by the year 2000, an immediate ban on nuclear weapons
tests and a multinational naval force under U.N. control.
   This is the third special session on disarmament in 10 years.
The previous meetings were in 1978 and 1982.

   President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday he
might invite Spain's Premier Filipe Gonzales to Paris next July at
the time of next year's economic summit.
   At a news conference, Mitterrand was asked if Spain might be
added to the seven summit nations next year.
   The French president did not answer directly, but said that
Gonzales and several other leaders might be asked to visit Paris
for the July 14, 1989, celebrations of the bicentennial of the
French Revolution _ which happens to coincide with the summit.
   Officials in the summit delegations consider highly unlikely any
expansion of the group's membership, which now consists of the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada
and the European Economic Community.

<TEXT>
   Socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou on
Tuesday reshuffled his Cabinet for the 14th time in seven years,
giving his 36-year-old son, George, a troubleshooting post as
minister of education and religion.
   Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement came to power
in 1981, also fired the ministers of transportation and public
order and named a dozen new undersecretaries.
   He made no changes at the foreign, defense or national economy
ministries, but announced the formation of a new ministry of
tourism and a new deputy minister's post for media affairs,
apparently to prepare the introduction of private television in
Greece.
   ``The premier decided to go ahead with certain structural
changes in crucial sectors ... so as to promote the government's
work,'' government spokesman Yiannis Roubatis said.
   The restructured Cabinet, to be sworn in Wednesday, will get
testing exposure from July 1 during Greece's six-month presidency
of the European Community.
   The new Cabinet also is likely to lead Greece into national
elections, due by mid-1989 at the latest.
   Antonis Tritsis resigned as minister of education and religion
last month. The younger Papandreou will have to solve a
five-week-old strike by high school teachers that has forced
postponement of year-end and university entrance examinations.
   George Papandreou also will oversee Greece's bid to stage the
1996 centennial modern Olympic Games in Athens, to be formally
launched later this month.
   The premier fired Public Order Minister Antonis Drossoyannis,
whose ministry has failed to crack down on terrorist attacks and
alleged corruption in the police force. He was replaced by former
Defense Undersecretary Anastasios Sehiotis.
   Transport Minister Costas Badouvas was replaced by Giorgos
Petsos, who was finance undersecretary.
   Vasso Papandreou, a leading member of the party executive, was
appointed to a new job as deputy trade minister with responsibility
for boosting exports. Ms. Papandreou is not related to the
69-year-old premier.
   Tourism Undersecretary Nikos Skoulas will take over the new
tourism ministry. Tourism is Greece's biggest single source of
foreign exchange.
   George Papandreou, an Amherst sociology major who did graduate
work at the London School of Economics, served from 1985-87 as
undersecretary for youth and sports.
   He was first elected to Parliament in 1981 from the western
Greek district of Achaia, the original home of the Papandreou
family.
   The premier's closest political confidant, Deputy Premier and
Justice Minister Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, kept both posts in the
reshuffle.
   Culture Minister Melina Mercouri, the only Cabinet member who
has kept the same portfolio since 1981, also held on to her job.
But she acquired a deputy minister for the first time, who will
oversee youth, sports, and adult education programs.
   Deputy Culture Minister Theodoros Stathis also will handle
contacts with the four million Greeks who live outside the country,
mainly in the United States, Australia and Canada.

<HEAD>Dissident Writers' Group Urges End To Strike; Other Unions Picket
Guild</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent members of the Writers
Guild of America broke with the union leadership Tuesday and urged
approval of the latest offer from producers to settle the 16-week
scriptwriters strike.
   Meanwhile, about 40 members of various craft unions picketed
briefly in front of the Writers Guild headquarters in West
Hollywood to call for an end to the strike, which they said was
threatening their jobs.
   Dissident members of the Writers Guild told a news conference
they were not anti-union in urging members to endorse the latest
offer at meetings in New York and Los Angeles Wednesday. They said
they were just trying to save jobs.
   ``We have a responsibility to the greater (entertainment)
community to end the strike,'' said Bruce Paltrow, one of the
creators of the recently canceled ``St. Elsewhere'' series.
   ``This is a decent contract offer, a vast improvement over what
we had, and certainly more than we expected to get,'' said Peter
Hyams, who has written or directed such films as ``Outland,''
``2010,'' and ``The Presidio.''
   The guild responded with a statement of support from other
notable members, including writer-producers Michael Mann, Lawrence
Kasdan, Richard Brooks, Billy Wilder and Norman Lear.
   ``We are opposed to any action that would divide and weaken the
guild at this difficult time,'' the statement said.
   Guild Executive Director Brian Walton said the dissidents'
attack was ``a well orchestrated press campaign'' aimed at
crippling the 9,500-member guild.
   The guild's negotiating committee and East and West Coast boards
last week recommended that members reject the producers' $71
million contract offer. They said the economic package on foreign
and one-hour residuals, or reruns, was unacceptable.
   Several of the industry's top ``hyphenates'' _ writer-producers
who hold union cards but also have become management by starting
their own production companies _ are among the dissidents.
   They include ``L.A. Law'' producer-writer Steve Bochco; Stephen
Cannell, who produces ``Hunter''; John Hughes, producer and writer
of such films as ``The Great Outdoors'' and ``Planes, Trains and
Automobiles;'' and ``Red Dawn'' writer John Milius.
   Hyams said the producers' current offer of a 14.7 percent
minimum increase for residuals was a victory for the union.
   Bochco said continuation of the strike would affect thousands of
jobs as production dates for the upcoming television season loom
during the next two weeks.
   ``The day is late and we are beginning to look at the calendar.
... If we begin to reduce the number of episodes we can make in a
season, that's when you begin to see tremendous economic loss _
irretrievable loss,'' Bochco said.
   All of the more than 20 writers who attended the news conference
insisted their personal interests were not at stake. Independent
writers who are trying to sell their scripts and have no other jobs
in the industry would be most harmed by a prolonged strike, they
said.
   Cannell, who belongs to both the guild and management's Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers, cited the recent drop
in syndication sales of one-hour TV shows and said both sides must
realize ``this business is in fact in desperate trouble.''
   About 300 members of the dissenting Writers Coalition met Monday
night and agreed to back the producers' offer.
   The coalition claims about 600 members, which it claims are
among the guild's most frequently employed members, and therefore
the biggest contributors to its health, welfare and pension fund.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister James Callaghan, now Lord
Callaghan, suffered a mild heart attack and was admitted to a
hospital Tuesday.
   Callaghan, 76, entered St. Thomas' Hospital in London for tests
after complaining of feeling unwell, the hospital said.
   It released no further information but Callaghan's former
parliamentary secretary, Roger Stott, said Callaghan ``suffered a
mild heart attack.''
   Stott said doctors at the hospital ``are hoping he may be out by
the end of the week, although he will have to take things very
easily.''
   Callaghan, a Labor Party leader and prime minister from
1976-979, had to cancel plans to attend an annual conference of
former heads of state or government in Colorado, said his daughter,
Margaret Jay.
   ``As I understand it, there is nothing to be alarmed about,''
she said. ``He seems very cheerful.''
   Callaghan succeeded Harold Wilson as prime minister and lost
power in 1979 to the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher.
   He is a member of the House of Lords, the unelected upper
chamber of Parliament.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said
Tuesday he expects Hungary's new leadership to be tested but he
warned against challenging the system.
   In a speech to the National Council of Trade Unions, Grosz spoke
about demonstrations, including one last Thursday commemorating the
30th anniversary of the execution of Imre Nagy, a leader of the
1956 revolt that was crushed by Soviet forces.
   According to witnesses, police broke up a demonstration by about
400 people who called for Nagy's official rehabilitation. Officals
said 15 people were detained for several hours.
   Grosz said ``hostile and opposition elements'' are exploiting
current debates in Hungary over how far to go in implementing
political reform.
   Grosz was chosen at the Communist Party conference last month to
replace Janos Kadar, who led Hungary for 32 years.
   Referring to the conference, Grosz said the new party leadership
is ``more sound politically, intellectually and organizationally.''
His comments were carried by the MTI news agency.
   It quoted him as saying the leadership respects ``everybody's
personal feelings'' but said he added: ``We firmly reject all kinds
of movement against the system ... and demonstrations against the
representatives of power.''
   The party's revamped Central Committee is to meet Thursday to
discuss greater opennesss in party affairs and economic change.
   Grosz indirectly criticized Kadar. MTI reported he said, ``We
want to rid our socialist system of the impediments it has had to
carry because of errors made by individuals.''
   He said one of the errors ``over the past 15 years is that we
did not accept political inconveniences and tried to evade serious
problems.''

<HEAD>President of State Oil Company Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government dismissed the president
of the state oil company Petrobras on Tuesday, the presidential
palace announced.
   Ricardo Pedreira, spokesman for President Jose Sarney, would not
give the reason for firing Ozires Silva but sources in the palace
cited his recent criticism of government economic policy,
particularly a two-month pay freeze for federal employees.
   It was the second dismissal in a few days of a high-ranking
official who criticized the wage policy.
   Late last week, Sarney fired the armed forces chief of staff,
Gen. Paulo Roberto Camarinha, for criticizing the freeze.
   Silva was quoted in the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo on Sunday
as saying of the wage freeze: ``It concerns us a lot. It is causing
real chaos.'' Petrobras has 55,000 employees.
   The measure was part of an austerity plan to help reduce
inflation and meet the International Monetary Fund's conditions for
rescheduling Brazil's $121 billion foreign debt.
   While salaries have been frozen for about 2 million federal
employees, the cost of living has risen nearly 40 percent. Judges
of the Superior Labor Court voted 10-3 on Monday saying the action
was unconstitutional because it discriminated among workers.
   Silva had said the measure should not have been applied to
Petrobras, a profitable company that has a monopoly on oil drilling
in Brazil. It produces about 60 percent of the nation's oil
requirements.

   The ordination of women as priests and even
bishops in the Anglican Communion need not disrupt the worldwide
meeting of the church's bishops next month, Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie said Tuesday.
   ``I hope that we shall be able to consider living together with
this degree of impaired communion that exists and I hope we will
get some idea of how the question is viewed from different parts of
the communion,'' he said.
   Runcie, spiritual head of the state Church of England and leader
of the world's 70 million Anglicans, held a news conference at his
Lambeth Palace residence to discuss the Lambeth Conference that
meets every 10 years.
   He said the 12th conference since 1867 will be attended by more
than 500 bishops at Canterbury from July 17-Aug. 7.
   Only a minority of the 27 Anglican communions in the world have
ordained women to the priesthood. Most are in the U.S. Episcopalian
Church, which is considering consecrating the first woman bishop
but is expected to wait to see how the debate develops at the
Lambeth Conference.
   The Church of England appears to be moving toward the ordination
of women and could decide by the mid-1990s, according to some
church leaders. They noted such a move would have to be approved by
Parliament because it is the state church.
   Some English bishops have said they would consider accepting
women priests but not a woman bishop because bishops are regarded
as the heirs of Christ's apostles, who were men.
   Bishops at the Lambeth Conference in 1978 agreed to accept
churches that ordained women priests and those that did not, and
urged each side to respect the other's convictions.
   Runcie said he hoped next month's conference would ``go beyond''
that decision, but he did not spell out what he thought might be
decided.
   Other major issues to be considered at the conference are the
spread of the AIDS disease, relations with other churches and the
future of the conference.
   Runcie was asked if the Canterbury meeting might be the last
Lambeth Conference and he said he had an open mind on whether the
conference should continue in its present form.
   He said there were logistical problems in organizing such a
large gathering as well as the question of ``impaired communion''
because of the differences over women priests.
   ``It would not be impossible in the future for a looser
association of conferences to take place,'' he said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, is a disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday
he found general agreement and optimism among the summit leaders,
adding that it would be ``completely false'' to call President
Reagan or any other leader a loser over the issue of farm subsidies.
   ``There was broad agreement that the economic policy
coordination, particularly of recent months, has proven itself
particularly effective,'' Kohl told reporters.
   The coordinated reaction of the summit nations following the
stock market crash last October contributed greatly to keeping the
world economy from collapsing, he said. And, the leaders agreed
that the prospects for the economy are favorable and encouraging,
Kohl said.
   ``In short, we have well-grounded cause to look forward with
optimism and trust,'' he said.
   Kohl was asked whether Europeans had been victorious in fending
off the attempt by President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney to pledge to end agriculture subsidies by the year
2000.
   ``Some journalists love simple formulas, and some journalists
above all love pictures that there are victors and vanquished,'' he
said. ``That would be a completely false picture.''
   In the talks on farm policy, the leaders had to take account of
the different situations in each summit country, he said.
   However, he said, ``We are moving completely on a similar
track.''
   ``The long-term goal must be a strong market-orientation of
agriculture production,'' rather than heavy subsidies, Kohl said.
``For this, realism and perspective are necessary.''
   The leaders must take into account the different size of farming
operations and in particular protect small family farms, he said.
West Germany has a number of such small holdings, rather than large
agribusinesses.
   Of special significance during the summit was the attention paid
to the debt burden of the world's poorest countries, especially
those in Africa, Kohl said.
   West Germany already has forgiven 4.2 billion marks, or $2.5
billion, in poor countries' debt and plans to take further measures
to ease their burden by another 2.3 billion marks, or $1.39 billion
dollars, he said.
   Kohl said he particularly urged environmental protection during
the summit, including a promotion of international attempts to
reduce acid rain and protect water resources, particularly the
North Sea.
   He said he would continue to pursue his goal of seeking to tie
protection of tropical rain forests to helping debt-ridden
countries, adding that ``doubtless the World Bank has an important
role to play.''
   The bank has been criticized for funding projects that destroy
the forests and the valuable resources they provide. The bank's
projects sometimes have included conversions of the forests into
farms that soon fail and turn to desert.
   Improvement of the plight of poor countries is also closely tied
to the fight against trade protection, he said.
   ``Without open markets, the developing countries have no chance
to improve their situation for the long term,'' he said.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Tuesday it had
agreed on an unusual tentative settlement of one of its most
controversial oil price cases, a case in which an administration
official was determined by his boss to have given the appearance of
a conflict of interest.
   The department said Anchor Gasoline Corp., a Tulsa, Okla.,
refiner, and its subsidiary, Canal Refining Co. of Church Point,
La., had agreed to pay $9 million and possibly as much as $30
million, plus certain interest charges which were not spelled out
in the announcement, to settle charges that the two firms charged
too much for crude oil and refined products in 1973-1981, when
price controls were in effect.
   The department still has outstanding about 200 overcharge cases.
President Reagan ended controls shortly after he took office in
1981.
   The Anchor settlement will go above $9 million if Anchor's net
income, as defined in the settlement, is enough to trigger
specified shares for the government during the four fiscal years
beginning May 1.
   The agreement calls for the government to take 12.5 percent of
net income from $1.5 million to $2 million and a rising percentage
of amounts above that, reaching 50 percent of anything over $5
million.
   In 1982, Joseph Wright Jr., deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget, called an official of the Energy
Department's Economic Regulatory Administration and asked him to
meet with Anchor officials to discuss a settlement. A meeting
occurred.
   Anchor is run by Wright's father. The family owned 20 percent of
the company, with Wright owning about 3 percent.
   Though a Senate committee explored the matter in 1985, the
Justice Department declined to pursue it.
   James Miller, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
wrote Wright in 1986 that his call ``created the appearance of a
conflict of interest,'' but kept him on the job.
   The settlement is open for public comment until July 18, when
the department's Economic Regulatory Administration will hold a
public hearing in Washington on the proposal.

   Crew members of a Liberian-registered incinerator
ship pushed two British Greenpeace activists into the North Sea 100
miles off England's eastern coast on Tuesday, the environmental
group said.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Greenpeace spokesman Martin Leeburn said that the two group
members, Phillip Cade and Hugh Stirling, wanted to chain themselves
to the funnels of the 3,356-ton Vulcanus II in order to stop the
vessel from burning toxic waste from Spain into the North Sea.
   After four attempts, the two succeeded in attaching wooden
ladders to the ship's side when unidentified crew members pushed
the ladders into the sea off the coast of Scarborough.
   The two men, both in their 20s, were rescued by colleagues in
rubber dinghies nearby.

   Leaders of the seven richest nations concluded
their annual summit Tuesday with a debt-relief plan for the world's
most desperately poor countries, proclaiming optimism about the
global economy but spurning President Reagan's plea to abolish farm
subsidies.
   Reagan acknowledged that ``there are some differences of
opinion'' on agricultural subsidies but said, ``I am not going to
give up on that.'' Showing no regrets over the final communique, he
said, ``I'm just surprised we got it done.''
   The three-day summit was Reagan's last, and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney thanked the president on behalf of the
Western leaders.
   ``His leadership has been strong, his accomplishments
substantial and his place in history secure ... We shall all miss
his warmth and his wisdom,'' Mulroney said after reading the final
communique.
   Proclaiming their talks a benefit for the entire world, the
summit leaders agreed to launch a new, seven-year cycle of summits
in France next year, beginning July 14, the bicentennial of the
start of the French Revolution, and running three days.
   Conferring around an octagonal table in a windowless, basement
room of Toronto's convention center, the leaders met for nearly
three hours _ an hour longer than scheduled. ``It was a very
vigorous exchange of views that produced a very substantial
document,'' said Mulroney, the host of the summit conference.
   Members of their delegations had worked through the night to
finish the final communique, completing work on the 34-paragraph
document at 5 a.m. EDT.
   It contained no surprises or breakthroughs.
   At a news conference after the close of the summit, Reagan said
he thought the U.S. policy of seeking to ease governmental
regulation and tax burdens for business has sent a message to the
rest of the industrialized world and that ``today, it defines the
consensus of the summit nations'' on economic strategy.
   In a speech Tuesday night, before leaving Toronto, Reagan told
an audience of wealthy Canadian business executives he hoped the
industrialized democracies would expand free trade and steer clear
of ``the protection and isolation that are relics of another age.''
   Displaying fascination with the technological revolution, Reagan
noted that a tiny silicon chip has the same power of the biggest
computers of the 1960s. ``Do we dare stop climbing?'' he asked.
   Despite the outward appearance of harmony, there were some sharp
differences among the leaders.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, at a closing news
conference, accused the United States of trying to transform the
summit into a permanent body that would try to run the world.
   Citing Reagan's call for a seven-nation drug task force, he
said, ``In whose name do these seven countries decide for the rest
of the world?''
   But he said his confrontations with Reagan on this and other
issues _ farm subsidies and aid to the Philippines _ ``did not
exceed reasonable bounds.''
   The communique said the leaders approved a plan allowing
creditor countries to choose from a menu of options in granting
debt relief to 20 to 30 nations of sub-Saharan Africa.
   On the agricultural subsidies issue, however, they stopped far
short of Reagan's proposal to eliminate subsidies by the year 2000,
an idea staunchly opposed by European nations and Japan.
   Instead, the leaders said negotiators must develop ``a framework
approach'' to reduce _ not eliminate _ the subsidies.
   Although that was far short of Reagan's proposal, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was still an improvement from
the vaguely worded language of the draft communique.
   ``The U.S. is happy with the final product,'' Fitzwater said.
   A political statement issued Monday praised Reagan for his arms
negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and urged the
superpowers to pursue deep cuts in their strategic nuclear arsenals.
   Offering Gorbachev an incentive to pursue his programs of
openness and freedom, the summit leaders held out the prospect of
expanded trade with the West and said that Soviet reforms would be
viewed positively.
   Reagan, stressing his free-market philosophy, had argued that
upwards of $200 billion a year is spent around the world each year
to subsidize farm exports. However, Europeans in particular argued
that it would be unrealistic to eliminate the politically popular
subsidies.
   Despite the rebuff on subsidies, Reagan basically got what he
wanted from the summit in terms of tougher action against terrorism
and illegal drug trafficking.
   At the urging of Reagan, the summit statement said the economic
problems of the Phillipines deserve special attention. However,
Reagan had to compromise with French President Francois Mitterrand
who insisted that Latin America, Africa and other Pacific nations
also be mentioned. The two leaders grappled at length over the
issue.
   In the final communique, the leaders said, ``Since we last met,
our economies have kept up the momentum of growth. Employment has
continued to expand, inflation has been restrained, and progress
has been made toward the correction of major external imbalances.
   ``These encouraging developments are cause for optimism but not
for complacency,'' the document said. ``To sustain non-inflationary
growth will require a commitment to enhanced cooperation. This is a
key to credibility and confidence.''
   On Third World debt, the leaders accepted a compromise put
forward by Canada that permits countries to exercise several
options for granting debt relief. They include extending the time
period for paying off loans, reducing interest rates or actually
writing off a portion of the loans.
   The United States was willing to extend payment periods but was
opposed to the other two debt relief measures, prompting the need
for the so-called ``menu'' approach.
   The leaders endorsed the process of closer economic cooperation
initiated at the Tokyo summit in 1986, saying the system was a key
reason that the world was able to avoid a global economic downturn
following the shock from last October's stock market collapse.
   ``Developments in the wake of the financial strains last October
demonstrate the effectivness and resilience of the arrangements
that have emerged,'' the stateent said.
   To further the coordination process, summit countries approved
use of a commodity price index to give them an early warning when
inflationary pressures are rising. The index is a compilation of
some 40 different commodities, including gold.
   The communique hailed many of Reagan's free-market ideas,
committing the countries to making more progress in deregulating
their economies. It also praised the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement and the efforts of the 12-nation European Community to
remove all trade barriers by the year 1992.
   The leaders called on the newly industrial countries, South
Korea Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, to do more to lower their
huge trade surpluses by opening up their markets and allowing their
currencies to strengthen in value.
   And they said efforts should be increased to protect the world's
environment, declaring more needs to be done to protect endangered
species and to fight threats posed by global climate changes, air
and water pollution and acid rain.

<HEAD>Presidential Campaign Officials Discuss Election Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The managers of Michael Dukakis' and Jesse
Jackson's Democratic presidential campaigns got together Tuesday
but focused more on the election of 28 years ago than the
differences of their candidates today.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich and her counterpart in
the Jackson camp, Gerald Austin, were among the participants in a
John F. Kennedy Library symposium that examined differences in the
presidential campaigns of 1960 and 1988 and the media's role in the
election process.
   Sponsored by Life magazine and moderated by ABC correspondent
Jeff Greenfield, the panel discussion dealt with three issues:
comparing the 1988 and 1960 presidential elections, assessing the
effect of television on the campaigns, and an analyzing how the
nation has changed in those 28 years.
   ``It was a lot of fun for me to sit and listen to the folks from
1960,'' said Estrich. ``I came away with both a renewed sense of
appreciation for that campaign and an appreciation of the new
rules.''
   One reason Estrich and Austin didn't spend too much time
discussing current conflicts was that their bosses were meeting
face-to-face across the country in Los Angeles.
   Veterans of the 1960 campaign who were present at the session
were 1960 Republican nominee Richard Nixon's press secretary,
Herbert Klein, and his 1960 campaign director, Robert Finch, along
with Kennedy's speech writer, Richard Goodwin.
   Among the topics of discussion was how much Kennedy's
Catholicism was an issue in the 1960 campaign, whereas religion is
not generally seen as a barrier to political office today.
   ``That suggests how far we have come in the past 28 years,''
Estrich said.
   Syndicated columnist Mary McGrory recalled how television played
a much smaller role in the 1960 campaign, which she covered, than
it does today, although the televised debates in 1960 were hailed
as a sign of television's first significant impact on presidential
politics.
   The panelists also discussed changes in rhetoric and
speech-making during campaigns _ changes they said were largely
dictated by the demands of television _ and the evolution of the
image of the presidency since 1960.

   Manuel J. Clouthier, presidential candidate
of the opposition National Action Party, said Tuesday he will name
the members of his intended Cabinet before the election so voters
will be better informed.
   ``I want the people to know beforehand who would form my
Cabinet,'' Clouthier told at a news conference at the Foreign
Correspondents Association.
   The president-elect usually announces his Cabinet on
inauguration day or just before. Clouthier, whose chances of
winning the July 6 election are considered nil, said he would
reveal his list next week.
   Carlos Salinas de Gortari is expected to be Mexico's next
president. He is the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, which was founded in 1929
and has governed the country since, never having lost a
presidential election.
   A poll called the ``most ambitious ever realized'' in Mexico
indicated 56 percent of registered voters favored Salinas.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist coalition candidate, was next in
the survey, obtaining 23 percent and Clouthier had 19. The Gallup
survey was conducted between May 12 and June 1 for ECO, Inc., a Los
Angeles-based affiliate of the private Televisa television network,
which has close ties to the government.
   Clouthier insisted he ha a chance, declaring Tuesday: ``There
hasn't been any government in the world that after three
consecutive years of more than 60 percent inflation still remains
in power. This July 6, Mexico won't be an exception.''
   National Action, popularly known by its Spanish initials PAN, is
the customary runnerup, but there had been speculation before the
poll that Cardenas would finish seocnd.
   Cardenas broke with the PRI last year after it rebuffed the
internal reform movement he called Democratic Current. His
coalition is called the National Democratic Front.
   National Action says many state and local election victories
have been stolen from it and Clouthier has called for civil
disobedience if ``alchemy,'' as vote fraud is known in Mexico,
occurs July 6.
   He is a business leader and rancher from the northwestern
coastal state of Sinaloa. His conservative party traditionally
fares best in northern Mexico.

   Michael Dukakis met privately with Jesse
Jackson Tuesday and discussed the Democratic vice presidential slot
but both refused to say whether Jackson asked for second billing on
the ticket.
   Jackson said they discussed the vice presidency ``to some
measure'' during the 40-minute meeting and he repeated his
assertion that ``our constituency deserves consideration.''
   Dukakis refused to give any hint of what they discussed.
   ``We talk about lots of things when we talk,'' Dukakis said at a
news conference following the session. ``I don't talk about private
conversations.''
   In a separate news conference, Jackson revealed few details.
   ``We talked about it more than we have talked about it (before)
person to person,'' Jackson said of the vice presidential question.
   Dukakis repeated earlier statements that he has begun looking at
vice presidential nominees but has made no decisions yet.
   ``The process has now begun. But it's open. There's no short
list, or medium list or long list,'' Dukakis said.
   ``There's no understanding (with Jackson),'' Dukakis continued.
``He himself has said it's up to the nominee to make that decision.
I agree with him.''
   Jackson reiterated his contention that he deserves consideration
as a potential running mate.
   ``This constituency we have organized in our party has earned
consideration,'' he said. ``Our constituency represents hope for
our party. It represents a commitment to make room for all
Democrats.''
   But asked if he told Dukakis that he wanted to be on the ticket,
Jackson said ``I'm not going to characterize exactly what we
discussed.''
   Dukakis, who now has more than enough to clinch the presidential
nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next
month, met with Jackson after addressing more than 3,500 members of
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   Jackson is to address the same group on Wednesday.
   In his AFSCME address, Dukakis renewed his call for a national
health insurance program, saying that should be ``the birthright of
every family and every citizen of the United States of America.''
   ``Two months ago, ... I became the first governor in America to
sign a bill that will guarantee health insurance for every single
citizen in my state,'' Dukakis said. ``And I look forward to the
day I can sign the same kind of bill into law for all Americans _
as president of the United States.''
   Dukakis said he would support legislation to require all except
the smallest businesses to provide health insurance, which he
presented as a fairness issue between employers as well as a basic
right for employees.
   ``Responsible employers, who provide insurance for their
workers, must compete with employers who don't provide a dime's
worth of coverage for their employees and dependents. That's not
fair. That's not right. And with your help we're going to change it
beginning in January of 1989,'' he said.
   ``The simplest way and the fairest way and the most affordable
way to expand the circle of health care and health opportunity for
our citizens is to require every employer _ with some exceptions
for small businesses _ to provide insurance coverage for their
workers and dependents,'' he said, estimating that about 38 million
Americans would be affected by such a proposal.

   The first person cited for allegedly
violating a new prohibition against smoking aboard domestic flights
of two hours or less has been sent a letter seeking $3,000 in
fines, officials said Tuesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration sent a letter to Darryl
Siegel of Seattle, telling him the agency's investigation concluded
he violated the rules while aboard USAir Flight 1355 from Seattle
to Reno, Nev., on May 12, FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said.
   They found that Siegel had disregarded a lighted no-smoking sign
aboard the flight, had smoked his cigarette in an airplane lavatory
and had disregarded the rule imposed April 23, which forbids
smoking on certain domestic flights, she said.
   Each alleged violation carries a maximum fine of $1,000.
   A woman who answered a call to a telephone listing for Siegel
said he was working and unavailable for comment.
   He can either pay the fine, seek a hearing to submit additional
information, or challenge the matter in U.S. District Court, said
Ms. Brekke. If he does not respond, the federal agency will take
the matter to court, she added.

   Three records were set Tuesday in the sale at
Sotheby's auction house of three manuscripts collected by William
Waldorf Astor.
   The three were among 20 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts
collected by Astor that sold for a total $8.3 million.
   At another Sotheby's sale, an American collector paid a record
$1.62 million for a work by the French romantic painter Eugene
Delacroix (1798-1863), providing French actor Alain Delon a huge
profit.
   Astor became the wealthiest American of the day when his father,
John Jacob Astor, died in 1890. The younger Astor moved to Britain,
bought the Cliveden mansion and Hever Castle and became a British
citizen in 1899. He died in 1919.
   Family trustees sold the manuscripts, most of which were bought
by dealers.
   The top price of 1.54 million pounds ($2.74 million) _ a record
for an English manuscript _ was paid by the London dealer Quaritch
for a prayer book made in about 1340 for Elizabeth de Bohun,
countess of Northampton. The previous high was 1.25 million pounds
(then $1.8 million) in June 1986 for a manuscript on the life of
St. Thomas Becket.
   Quaritch also paid the record for an Italian manuscript, 770,000
pounds ($1.37 million) for a 15th century prayer book made for
Galeazzo Maria Sforza, duke of Milan.
   The highest price for a Flemish manuscript, 1.21 million pounds
($2.15 million), was paid by the West German dealer Tenschert for a
16th century prayer book of Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg.
   Sotheby's said the American bid by telephone to acquire the
Delacroix painting of an Arab with drawn sword on a galloping
horse. The price paid, 913,000 pounds ($1.62 million), is more than
double the previous price for a work by the artist. The buyer was
not identified.
   Delon bought the painting in Paris in 1977 for 49,000 pounds
(then $124,000).
   Also at Sotheby's Tuesday, a fragment o a biblical manuscript
found in the sands of Egypt and kept in Boston since 1950 sold for
104,500 pounds ($186,000).
   The torn and stained scrap of vellum bearing Greek writing was
believed to date from the third century and is the earliest known
manuscript of part of St. Paul's letter to the Romans on the
concept of justification by faith.
   It was bought by Quaritch and the seller was not identified.

   Western leaders on Tuesday marked the end of
President Reagan's foray into economic summitry with a resounding
tribute to a ``gracious friend and trusted ally'' and a declaration
that Reagan's place in history had been secured.
   The Toronto summit was Reagan's eighth, and when the seven
summit nations meet next, in France in July 1989, the United States
will be represented by one of two likely successors _ Vice
President George Bush or Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Asked if he would miss the annual gatherings, Reagan told
reporters, ``In a way, yes.''
   Reagan's summit partners were quick to praise the president
throughout the three-day meeting. But when it came to the final
communique, they denied him what he had sought most _ an end to all
agricultural subsidies by the end of the century.
   Still, the president said he was satisfied with the results of
his final summit.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, speaking on behalf of
the Western leaders, used the occasion of the reading of the final
communique to deliver a formal thank you to the American president.
   ``His leadership has been strong, his accomplishments
substantial and his place in history secure,'' Mulroney declared.
``Ronald Reagan has been for all of us at this table a gracious
friend and a trusted ally. We shall all miss his warmth and his
wisdom.''
   Mulroney said Reagan was leaving Toronto with the respect and
affection of the summit leaders and ``our best wishes for good
health and every happiness for Nancy and himself.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand was a lot cooler.
   ``For someone who played a great role in contemporary history,
it's normal to salute him and wish that his retirement be happy and
long,'' Mitterrand said. ``It's a courtesy. It has nothing to do, I
suppose, with politics.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the dean of the summit
leaders and a philosophical soulmate of the president's, told
reporters she had only ``kind words'' for Reagan.
   ``He's been marvelous,'' she said.
   At a news conference later, she said that Mulroney's tribute had
the support of ``each and every one of us _ the whole-hearted
support and affection for President Reagan and what he has done.''
   Mrs. Thatcher and Reagan will meet at least once again before he
leaves office. Reagan has invited her to visit him in Washington
after the November elections.

   President Reagan, in a summit farewell address,
urged his economic partners on Tuesday to expand free trade and
steer clear of ``the protection and isolation that are relics of
another age.''
   Winding up his eighth and final session with the leaders of
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, the
77-year-old president left them also with a message of faith in the
technological revolution.
   In a speech to a group of Canadian businessmen prior to his
departure from Canada, Reagan noted a tiny silicon chip has the
power of the biggest computers of the 1960s. ``Do we dare stop
climbing?'' he asked.
   Reagan is credited with persuading his summit partners through
the years to encourage free-market trends and to eschew
protectionism. At his final summit, however, he was unable to rally
them behind his appeal for an end to agricultural subsidies by the
year 2000.
   Still, in the final communique, the seven leaders offered a
vague promise to consider the problems of farm subsidies, and the
White House found a victory in that decision.
   ``The U.S. is happy with the final product,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.
   Reagan, in his speech, warned that ``protectionist storms'' were
brewing around the world. The choice, he said, was ``between moving
toward freer trade, or backward toward the protection and isolation
that are relics of another age.''
   He said the industrialized democracies could not stand still,
and in a special reference to Canada, he said ``we North Americans
never have. We have always risen to meet a challenge. Our hearts
quicken to the call, our eyes brighten, our pace picks up.''
   Looking back before his two-term presidency, Reagan said
``inflation, stagnation, decline and despair characterized, in one
measure or another, the economies of nearly all the summit nations.
Today, we live in a time of hope.''
   Reagan also gave the businessmen a glowing report of his summit
meeting in Moscow three weeks ago with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   He called the general secretary ``a serious man seeking serious
reform'' and said their talks focused on freedom of choice and
other individual freedoms.
   ``I know I speak for all of us in saying our prayers go with the
Soviet peoples,'' Reagan said.

<HEAD>BBC Says Government Drops Ban on Spy Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday that
the government has agreed to lift a six-month-old ban on a BBC
radio series about Britain's security services.
   It said it planned to broadcast its Radio 4 series, ``My
Country: Right or Wrong,'' next week. The three-part series
features interviews with nine former or serving intelligence
officials.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration won a court
order last Dec. 4 to prevent the series from being broadcast. It
claimed the nine officials might have broken their oaths of secrecy
and said the series could harm national security.
   BBC initially refused to turn over the transcripts of the series
to government officials, saying that would amount to
pre-censorship, but later relented.
   Publicly funded BBC issued a statement Tuesday saying the
government's treasury solicitor ``has informed the BBC that he will
cease his action against the Radio 4 series.''
   ``The BBC and the treasury solicitor will apply to the court
this week to have the injunction lifted, and the BBC hopes to
transmit the series next week across three successive days,'' it
said.
   BBC deputy director general John Birt criticized the
government's attempt to block the series and said the action had
``prevented a serious discussion of matters of public concern when
interest in them was most ripe.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis emerged from a meeting with Jesse Jackson on
Tuesday and said ``the process has now begun'' by which he will
chose a Democratic running mate. Sources said he had requested
background information on Jackson and at least one other
possibility, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida.
   Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, reassured congressional
Republicans worried about his presidential bid.
   And President Reagan remained unfazed about Bush's chances for
victory in November. Asked about the prospect that Dukakis might
succeed him, Reagan said: ``Over my live body.''
   Dukakis and Jackson met privately for about 40 minutes, but
neither would say whether Jackson requested a spot on the ticket.
   ``We talked about it more than we have talked about it (before)
person to person,'' Jackson said of the vice presidential question.
   He reiterated his contention that he should at least be sized up
as a potential running mate, saying: ``this constituency we have
organized in our party has earned consideration.''
   Dukakis refused to give any hint of what they discussed, and
said no decisions had been made yet on a running mate.
   ``The process has now begun. But it's open. There's no short
list, or medium list or long list,'' Dukakis said.
   It was the first Dukakis-Jackson session since the two met
privately for 90 minutes on the eve of the final June 7 primaries,
when Dukakis locked up enough delegates to assure his Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Sources said Dukakis has requested background information on
both Jackson and Graham and that the Dukakis campaign has begun
public polling to determine who would best help the Democratic
ticket.
   Some in Congress, however, are advising the Dukakis campaign to
steer clear of Jackson, sources reported. They said Paul Brountas,
who is guiding the search for a running mate, received advice in
Congress last week to look elsewhere.
   Bush met over lunch with Senate Republicans, who said later they
told the vice president of their concern about polls showing him
behind Dukakis. They offered their help in his behalf ``like a
bunch of trout ready to jump out of the water,'' said Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Bush acknowledged he trails but said he was unconcerned. ``I
read the polls. They don't bother me,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm convinced we can carry the day,'' Bush told the 46 Senate
Republicans. ``I am not going to be outhustled by Michael Dukakis,
I can guarantee you.''
   Although Jackson has mounted a public campaign to pressure the
vice presidential choice in his favor, Dukakis' aides say it is
unlikely Jackson will wind up in the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Brountas met with Democratic leaders in Congress last week.
Sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said he was
advised privately that the ticket should be balanced with a
moderate or conservative candidate attractive in the South or West.
   Dukakis spoke to the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees in Los Angeles, where he called for policies to
control health costs and provide long-term care for an estimated 8
million people who need it.
   ``I'm running for president because I want to make sure that
quality, affordable health care is available to every family and
citizen in this land,'' he said in prepared remarks.
   Reagan sought to provide a boost of sorts to his two-term vice
president, who long ago locked up the GOP presidential nomination,
after meeting with foreign leaders at the economic summit in
Toronto.
   Emerging from the final formal meeting of the last summit of his
presidency, Reagan was asked whether he thought Dukakis would be
elected. He replied, ``Over my live body.''
   Reagan is making plans to spend two days a week campaigning for
Bush this fall, aides said.
   While consistently trailing Dukakis in the polls, Bush has been
forced to pinch pennies to stay within federal campaign spending
limits. According to federal reports, Bush was only $1.7 million
away from the $23 million pre-convention spending limit as of the
first of June.
   Bush's campaign had $3 million in cash on hand, $1 million more
than Dukakis had. But the Democratic nominee-to-be reported a good
month of fund-raising and was free to spend $3.6 million before
reaching the federal ceiling.
   Dukakis is keeping up a schedule of campaign trips every week,
laying groundwork for the fall and trying to keep the focus off his
running mate search.
   Bush, by contrast, has been forced to stay close to home to hold
down expenses and must keep his operation alive with little
spending before the Republican convention begins August 15. The
Democratic convention opens July 18.
   The latest indicator of the Dukakis-Bush race, a Washington Post
survey conducted over five days ending last Sunday, showed Dukakis
leading nationally by 12 percentage points, with a margin of error
of 3 points either way.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Tuesday hailed the Toronto summit as a success despite the absence
of agreement on farm subsidies, and said the free-market policies
pushed there ``make for a better world.''
   ``We've made a start,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, defending the vague
language in the summit communique on farm subsidies and its
effective rejection of a U.S. proposal to eliminate the subsidies
by the year 2000.
   ``There is a specific commitment to try first to freeze and then
to roll back the subsidies and various other kinds of support for
agriculture in an ordered and substantial way,'' she told a news
conference at the conclusion of the three-day summit.
   ``It means not just having a higgledy-piggledy, haphazard
reduction, but really trying to stick to some principles ... We
need to set long-term objectives and each have some short-term
objective going toward the long term.''
   She said the sustained economic growth enjoyed by the world's
richest countries stemmed from ``the cooperation and common sense
of purpose between the summit countries during the 1980s in
applying sound economic policies, containing inflation, promoting
efficiency, enterprise and competition.''
   Praising the free-market policies pushed at the summit, Mrs.
Thatcher said, ``Success, however hard to come by, may not make
news, but it does make for a better world.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has been President Reagan's staunchest
foreign ally, said ``each and every one of us'' felt
``whole-hearted support and affection for President Reagan and what
he has done.''
   Asked whether she would carry the torch with Reagan's departure,
Mrs. Thatcher said, ``I just see myself as carrying on, believing
the things that I have believed and trying to translate them into
action.''
   ``This final summit (for Reagan) underlines the success of the
economic policies we have pursued in this second (seven-year) cycle
of summit meetings in which he played such an important part.''
   She said the summit also ``sharpened the attack on terrorism''
by endorsing International Civil Aviation Organization call that
countries should agree not to allow hijacked aircraft to take off.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who apologized during the summit to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the hooliganism in Europe of British
soccer spectators, said she had suggested during the summit that
discipline was a tougher problem now than adapting to technological
change.
   ``What we are faced with now are some of the really tricky
problems _ some of the behavioral problems,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
``These are the problems that really go to the root of the quality
of life.''

   A jury on Tuesday began deliberating
whether Paul Newman reneged on a promise to give a delicatessen
owner a share of the actor's food business.
   The jury, which interrupted about five hours of deliberations
twice to ask questions and have testimony re-read, was to resume
deliberations Wednesday.
   Julius Gold of Westport contends in the Superior Court lawsuit
that he helped develop and market Newman's Own salad dressing and
that he was assured orally that he would receive 8 percent of the
stock in return.
   Gold said he contributed 30 months' effort to Newman's company
and believed his ``judgment and perserverance ... led to the
success of this corporation.''
   Newman, president and founder of Newman's Own Inc., testified
that Gold had never received such a commitment and that the idea
for the dressing, its recipe and packaging were his own.
   Newman's Own, whose products include spaghetti sauce, lemonade
and popcorn, has donated $15 million to charity since 1982 and
helped create a camp for seriously ill children in Connecticut.
   Lawyers have given no estimate of what an 8 percent stake would
be worth.
   Named in the suit besides Newman are his food companies,
Newman's Own Inc. and Salad King Inc.; Newman's partner and
longtime friend, author A.E. Hotchner, and food distributor David
Kalman.

   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita viewed
the economic summit with a ``sense of fulfillment'' and won praise
from the Western leaders for his country's success in narrowing its
trade surpluses, an aide said Tuesday.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, chief cabinet councillor for external
affairs, told reporters that Japan's three priorities for the
Toronto summit produced results.
   He listed them as strengthening policy coordination among the
seven largest industrial democracies and the European Community,
resisting protectionism and addressing the problem of Third World
debt.
   ``I am finishing this summit meeting with a sense of
fulfillment,'' the official quoted Takeshita as saying.
   ``The prime minister was gratified to confirm the importance
every summiteer attaches to policy coordination. He finds that
sustained growth without inflation has now taken root in the minds
of every summiteer.''
   Takeshita found it reassuring that other leaders strongly resist
protectionism, while special Japanese farming considerations were
taken into account in calling for reduced farm subsidies, Kunihiro
said.
   On debt, Takeshita was ``particularly pleased'' that a great
deal of attention was paid to poor developing countries and
understood the lack of specific action for middle-income debtors
such as Brazil, where the problem is more complex and requires a
``menu approach.''
   Kunihiro said Takeshita won ``complimentary remarks'' from
several summit partners for Japan's recent success in boosting
imports and narrowing its trade surpluses.
   Kunihiro said this may have accounted for the absence of any
Japan-bashing in Toronto, in contrast to summits in past years.
   ``Statistics talked on our behalf,'' he said.

   A hearing officer on Tuesday
dismissed a $1,000 fine imposed against a woman for allegedly
violating the state's charity law by misusing funds donated for her
late son's liver transplants.
   Administrative Hearing Officer Donald Alexander in Tallahassee
said in his decision that all the money donated for Ronnie
DeSillers' transplants became part of his estate after his death,
exempting the funds from the state charity law.
   ``As such, the Circuit Court has `exclusive jurisdiction' to
ensure that the donated funds, which are now a part of Ronnie's
estate, are used for legitimate purposes,'' Alexander wrote.
   Alexander emphasized that his ruling applied only to whether the
boy's mother, Maria DeSillers, was required to register as a
charity. He said he was not ruling on whether Ms. DeSillers
received or used the money legitimately.
   The decision noted that other court remedies are available for
those who want to challenge her use of the money.
   The 7-year-old Miami boy died at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant
after a fund-raising drive that brought in $660,000, including a
$1,000 donation from President Reagan.
   The Dade County state attorney's office is investigating
allegations that Ms. DeSillers made personal use of $47,000 of
donations to her son.
   An official appointed by the state attorney's office reported
last month that Ms. DeSillers spent some $200,000 of donations on
herself, relatives and friends. The spending included payments of
$10,850 to a jewelry store and $23,700 to Ms. DeSillers'
ex-boyfriend, the report said.
   Ms. DeSillers hailed Tuesday's decision.
   ``People should realize I never did anything wrong. Everything I
did was for Ronnie,'' she said at a news conference.
   ``The state has nothing to show my side of it. I will be
vindicated in the end.''
   Ms. DeSillers' lawyer, Harry Robbins, said the ruling showed Ms.
DeSillers violated no laws and that the money remaining in the
estate should belong to her.
   ``We believe that this is the beginning of a vindication
process,'' said Robbins. ``Maria only wanted to do good. She only
wants to help people.''
   Robbins acknowledged Ms. DeSillers still faces legal problems
that are likely to continue for years, but he said she will
continue working to increase organ donor awareness.
   Court documents show $509,912 of donations was in Ronnie's
account when he died. About $239,288 remained in a custodial
account on Feb. 18.

   Preservation of Matagorda Island, habitat for
wintering whooping cranes and other endangered species of birds,
entered the home stretch when a Senate committee approved
legislation to buy the last bit of privately held land on the
barrier island, officials said Tuesday.
   ``This is important not only for whooping cranes, but for water
fowl, shore birds, and herons, egrets and song birds,'' said Brent
Giezentanner, manager of the nearby Aransas Pass National Wildlife
Refuge.
   A Senate appropriations subcommittee late Monday approved
spending $5.5 million to purchase 5,017 acres at the southern tip
of the Texas Gulf Coast island.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will buy the land at cost
from the Texas Nature Conservancy, and when the deal goes through
all the land on the island will be in either federal or state
ownership, according to the office of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   But a Gramm staffer said it still is unclear how the land will
be managed, with debate centering on whether it should be the state
or federal government or both. The state controls 24,893 acres, and
when the final purchase goes through, the federal government will
control 30,502 acres.
   As the whooping crane flock grows, some of the endangered birds
have wintered on Matagorda Island rather than at the Aransas refuge.
   ``This is going to preserve and protect their habitat from
development,'' said Giezentanner. ``There are only two barrier
islands in Texas that are not developed to some degree _ Matagorda
and (adjacent) San Jose.''
   More than 230 species of birds can be found on Matagorda Island,
including endangered song birds who make the island their first
landfall upon their northern spring migration from South America,
Giezentanner said. A total of 20 endangered species of birds use
the island.
   He said 132 whooping cranes wintered last year at the Aransas
refuge or nearby, including Matagorda Island. Two other members of
the flock also spent the winter in Texas _ a record high since the
early 1930s.
   The record low was in 1941, when 15 of the birds spent the
winter in Texas and six others in Louisiana, he said.
   Of the 134 whooping cranes that left Wood Buffalo National Park
in the Northwest Terrorities, Canada, for Texas last fall, 25 were
fledged birds _ those just able to fly _ and all made the 2,500 to
2,800-mile journey.

   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney put a
positive spin on the economic summit's refusal Tuesday to abolish
agricultural subsidies by the year 2000, saying, ``We have come a
long way'' since the issue was placed on the agenda two years ago.
   Mulroney, host of the 14th annual meeting of the world's largest
industrialized democracies, had hoped that his summit colleagues
would take firm action to end the subsidy war, an issue pushed by
President Reagan.
   Although the final communique called only for reductions in
subsidies, not their elimination as the United States proposed,
Mulroney declared himself ``well pleased.''
   ``We have come a long way'' since the issue was placed on the
summit agenda in Tokyo two years ago, he said.
   He termed the declaration ``a strong signal of continued
political support for reform'' in advance of the December meeting
in Montreal, which will complete a mid-term review of the current
trade talks.
   ``It is not a perfect statement but it represents some
progress,'' Mulroney said.
   The Conservative leader said he was gratified that the summit
``strongly welcomed'' the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement _ which
has run into heated opposition within Canada.
   ``It's pretty hard to do better than that,'' he said of the
communique's language.
   Most of all, Mulroney said, he was pleased with the success of
the two additional negotiating sessions he introduced into economic
summitry, including a relaxed talk about educational needs of the
future.
   ``The summit as a forum has been strengthened,'' he said.

   David Cassidy, who was a teen heartthrob when
he played a rock singer on television's ``Partridge Family,'' was
sued by a woman who says the actor fathered her 18-month-old
daughter and refuses to support the girl.
   Model-actress Sherry Williams, 35, says Cassidy, 38, is the
father of her daughter Katherine Evelyn Cassidy, according to the
paternity suit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson, best known for winning ``palimony'' rights for
the live-in lovers of Hollywood celebrities, filed the suit.
   The complaint seeks to establish paternity and asks for $5,000 a
month in child support and medical care.
   Cassidy, who is divorced, was in Europe and couldn't be reached
for comment, said his manager Melanie Green.
   Cassidy was 20 when he starred as the squeaky-clean rocker on
``Partridge Family,'' which also starred his stepmother Shirley
Jones. He also turned out several records before returning to
acting on stage a decade later.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Former President Leslie Manigat
urged the world Tuesday to shun the soldiers who threw him out of
office, but opposition politicians called him an opportunist and
said they were glad he was gone.
   One opposition leader suggested negotiations with Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who proclaimed himself president on Monday.
   As night fell on a calm capital late Tuesday, there was concern
among relatives of some members of the Manigat government who were
arrested during the coup.
   ``We only hope they come back as soon as possible,'' said
Francois Savain. His father, Roger Savain, was information minister
and Francois' brother, Roger Jr., was a close friend of Manigat.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the two Savains, former Information Ministry officials Rodney
Marcellus and Jean Narces Lescouflair, and Manigat Cabinet chief
Lionel Desgranges were arrested. The source didn't know whether the
five remained in custody Tuesday.
   Capt. Isidor Pignon, commander of Fort Dimanche where political
prisoners are usually taken, angrily refused to tell The Associated
Press whether the Manigat aides were there.
   Few other people in this impoverished city seemed upset by the
events that ended Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government and
brought back Namphy, who had run the country for two years after
the Duvalier dictatorship ended.
   ``The message is clear: Haitians have been mocked for too long
by their governments. The people are not concerned because they
never accepted Manigat. This has been an affair at the top,'' said
the Rev. Antoine Adrien, a liberal Roman Catholic priest and
advocate of democracy.
   A sociologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``Manigat by words alone wanted to maintain the illusion of
democracy. One puff of the army's bad breath blew it away.''
   In Washington, the State Department said the United States would
maintain relations with the new government and work toward
democracy through diplomacy, not sanctions. ``There is no break in
the diplomatic relations; we're not contemplating it,'' spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said.
   Manigat is in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola with Haiti. He told reporters he had been
urging foreign governments and international organizations to
isolate the military government Namphy set up.
   ``My government represented the only and final chance for
democracy,'' Manigat said. ``The other democratic sectors have
understood that too late and it was their political mistake to
refuse the public support that would have strengthened my
government.''
   Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor,
called the new regime ``very fragile.'' He said the coup was the
result of corruption in the military.
   He said he did not know what role was played in the coup or
subsequent events by Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who has been indicted
on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in Miami.
   ``Namphy always acted on his own,'' Manigat said, adding that he
had faith in Paul as a loyal military man.
   Manigat sided with Paul last week by overruling Namphy's order
ending the colonel's command of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion,
whose barracks is just behind the National Palace.
   Manigat dismissed Namphy and confined him to his home, but loyal
officers freed him late Sunday.
   Paul, however, was at Namphy's side Monday when the 55-year-old
general waved an Uzi submachine gun on television and announced his
military government. Namphy restored Paul to his command and the
7,000-man Haitian army appears united.
   No injuries or deaths have been reported in the coup. Sporadic
shooting was heard in Port-au-Prince overnight but no casualties
were reported Tuesday. Gunfire at night is part of a tradition of
intimidation in Haiti.
   Opposition political leaders boycotted the Jan. 17 election,
which Manigat won with the army's help. Most expressed the belief
Tuesday that a new chance for democracy might follow his ouster.
   In Puerto Rico, where he lives in self-exile, Louis Dejoie II
urged a dialogue between Namphy and politicians.
   ``The only way to put the country back on track is to have free,
honest elections,'' said Dejoie, one of four leading presidential
candidates who refused to enter the Jan. 17 election. ``Manigat was
not viable nationally or internationally'' and ``tried to
double-cross the army the way he double-crossed the democratic
forces.''
   ``Namphy has no popularity,'' he said. ``I will wait and see
what the military government offers the people before judging them.
They can't govern forever with bayonets.''
   Haiti, the world's first black republic, won independence from
France in 1804 and has experienced dozens of coups and autocratic
regimes.
   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran Haiti after
President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Feb. 7, 1986, ending the
29-year dictatorship founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier. Namphy turned the government over to Manigat last Feb. 7.
   Namphy said he overthrew Manigat because the president betrayed
democracy and the constitution. Namphy and his army have made clear
they consider a good civilian government to be one that lets the
military keep its traditional role as the power behind the throne.

   Game show host Pat Sajak, hoping to send
CBS's late-night ratings wheels spinning with a new talk show, says
the program is still in the formative stages, with the biggest
decision so far being a name.
   It's going to be called ``The Pat Sajak Show.''
   ``I guess it isn't the most creative thing in the world, but it
says what it is,'' said Sajak, the low-key host of ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' the most successful television series in syndication
history.
   ``Of course, I had a different idea,'' said Sajak. ``I looked up
and down the CBS schedule and saw `Kate & Allie,' `Cagney & Lacey,'
`Eisenhower & Lutz,' `Jake and The Fatman.' So I thought a good
name would be `Pat and His Desk.'''
   Sajak, 41, will be the latest to go up against the mighty Johnny
Carson in the late-night slot, a time when Joan Rivers and Alan
Thicke have failed.
   But CBS, last in prime-time and late-night ratings, is betting
Sajak's popularity from ``Wheel of Fortune'' will translate to
viewers when the show starts in January.
   The network has given ``The Pat Sajak Show'' a two-year
commitment and is building a studio for it in Hollywood.
   ``I mean, obviously, that's what I'm doing is competing in the
same time slot with Carson,'' said Sajak. ``All I can say is I'm
going to do a good show and let the pieces fall where they may.''

<TEXT>
   A group of Atlantic Coast Indian
rebels declared they were renewing their warfare against the
leftist Sandinista government, said a statement published Tuesday
night in the opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   The communique of the Yatama Indian rebel organization rejected
peace negotiations with the Sandinistas and said the government
would have ``to revise its dictatorial policies to implant the
conditions for a true democracy in our country.''
   The rebel Yatama Indians seek a form of self-government for the
indigenous tribes along the so-called Mosquito Coast of the
Atlantic. The Sandinistas have reached agreements with other Indian
rebel groups to lay down their arms.
   Yatama organizers claim to have 2,000 combatants. At least 1,000
have surrendered since last year and the Indian war had stopped for
the most part along the Atlantic.
   The statement, signed by Yatama general coordinator Wicliff
Diego, said the Sandinistas refused to accede to their demands for
autonomous rule.
   ``In view of this, our indigenous organization wants to manifest
its firm contention to continue the armed fight until we reach a
democracy that guarantees rights to all the people, especially
Indian rights,'' it said.
   ``The armed fight will continue, with or without military aid.''
   There was no immediate response from the government.
   Cease-fire talks with the Indians began in May, little more than
a month after the U.S.-supported mainstream rebels, known as
Contras, reached a temporary truce with the Sandinistas. The
Indians received a small part of the millions of dollars in
military and economic aid supplied by the U.S. government.
   The Indian fight, however, is markedly different from the
Contras. Tens of thousands of Miskito, Rama and Sumo Indians were
forced from their tribal lands in 1981 when the Sandinistas said
they uncovered a plan to oust government representatives in the
jungle-like region.
   Thousands fled tribal homelands across the winding Coco River
into Honduras. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
reported that most have returned to the 75-mile long Atlantic
seaboard that is their home.

   West German soccer fans and local
youth gangs attacked police with firebombs and stones in downtown
Hamburg Tuesday night after the Netherlands' victory over West
Germany in the European Championships.
   Police spokesman Bernd Metterhausen said 10 police officers were
injured and at least 30 people arrested in running clashes that
continued into the early hours Wednesday.
   Two West German groups _ including scores of right-wing
extremists and rival leftists _ also attacked each other, with
police officers caught in the middle, police officials said.
   On Tuesday afternoon radical West German right-wingers had
distributed leaflets challenging Hamburg leftists to a fight that
night.
   Metterhausen said 1,000 West German soccer fans and skinheads,
young toughs who shave their heads, massed in the Reeperbahn, a
downtown area noted for pornographic displays and prostitution.
   No Dutch fans were involved in the skirmishes, he said.
   Police vans lined the area as 600 officers in riot gear restored
order.
   Metterhausen said the violence began shortly before midnight
Tuesday, when fans returning from the match began attacking police
officers.
   ``We were dealing with that incident when a gang of punks, who
live in the harbor area of the city, came up to the Reeperbahn and
also joined in,'' he said.
   ``The police were being attacked from both sides. They were
being attacked with stones, metal balls launched with catapults,
sticks and even Molotov cocktails,'' he added.
   ``Several police were hurt and two were taken to hospital after
being hit on the head by missiles,'' Metterhausen said.
   Eight other officers needed treatment for effects of tear gas,
which the gangs threw at police.
   Police, most in riot helmets and carrying shields, stood by as
the fans and youths gathered in the Reeperbahn.
   Also watching were several hundred Dutch fans, who were
celebrating their 2-1 victory and appeared to be taking no part in
the violence.
   One said: ``When we entered the district, some people simply
started pushing us, looking for trouble. That is when it all got
out of hand.''
   Another Dutch fan said: ``Pretty soon, police with dogs came on
the scene to try to restore order.''

<BYLINE>Jury Selected In Ex-Football Star's Trial For 31-Year-Old Slaying

   A former college football star went on
trial on first-degree murder charges Tuesday, nearly 31 years after
the man he is accused of slaying was shot to death.
   Bobby Hoppe, 53, is charged with the 1957 shotgun death of Don
Hudson, a 24-year-old moonshine runner who had dated Hoppe's sister.
   Prosecutor Tom Evans and defense attorneys Bobby Lee Cook and
Leroy Phillips spent more than six hours Tuesday in Hamilton County
Criminal Court selecting a jury. Opening arguments are scheduled
Wednesday before Judge Joe DiRisio.
   Hudson, an ex-convict who had several scrapes with the law, was
shot in the early morning hours of July 20, 1957, as he drove his
car on a street in North Chattanooga, not far from his home.
   Hoppe, a star running back who went on to help lead a 10-0
Auburn University team to the 1957 national football championship,
was questioned at the time of the slaying.
   However, no one was arrested in connection with Hudson's death
until Hoppe was indicted last March, after police reopened the case
at the request of Hudson's mother, Georgia.
   Key prosecution witnesses in the case are expected to be the
Rev. Joseph Godwin, a Baptist minister who is mayor of Mars Hill,
N.C., and Odene Neal of Red Bank, Tenn., who was an acquaintance of
Hoppe in 1957.
   During a pretrial hearing earlier this month, Godwin testified
that he was taking a summer class at Auburn in a957 when Hoppe came
to him and said he had killed a man.
   Defense attorneys argued then that Godwin's testimony shouldn't
be allowed because of a 1959 law prohibiting the courtroom use of
conversations with ministers. DiRisio ruled that Godwin and Hoppe
did not have a pastoral relationship.
   Mrs. Neal testified during another pretrial hearing that seven
hours before Hudson was slain Hoppe had threatened to kill him. She
said Hoppe made the statement after Mrs. Neal told him that Hudson
had ``smacked around on'' Hoppe's sister, Joan, whom Hudson had
dated.
   In a successful defense motion Monday to get a list of the
state's witnesses, Cook and Phillips described Godwin's and Neal's
testimony as false and manufactured.
   Hoppe is on an unpaid leave from his job as athletic director at
Chattanooga State Technical Community College. If convicted, he
faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison.
   Tennessee has a death penalty, but Hoppe is being tried under
the law as it existed in 1957.

   Rockwell International Corp. and two former
executives pleaded innocent Tuesday to federal charges accusing the
aerospace contractor of overbilling the Air Force by $450,000.
   The pleas were entered in a hearing before U.S. District Judge
Consuelo B. Marshall, who set trial for Oct. 11.
   A seven-count indictment filed earlier this month names Rockwell
and two former managers at the Seal Beach Satellite Systems
division, Donald H. Carter, 59, and Robert Zavodnik, 46, with
overbilling on a navigation system contract.
   Thomas Holliday, a Rockwell attorney, declined to comment on the
case.

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Tuesday that bribery and
fraud in the the multi-billion dollar purchasing program of the
Pentagon was ``understandable'' given the size of the government,
but that he was ``very upset'' about the alleged scope of the
problem.
   At a news conference marking the end of his eighth and final
economic summit, Reagan also was asked about the drought plaguing
the United States. Noting he has set up a task force to look into
the problem, Reagan said, ``outside of praying for rain, there
isn't anything I can do until we hear from them.''
   On another subject, he suggested that gun-control laws should be
tightened to require that gun-holders undergo some training.
   After the news conference and a speech to Canadian businessmen,
Reagan returned home to Washington, where he was met at the White
House by chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.
   Uncharacteristically, Reagan did not have a full house of
reporters for his news conference. Some correspondents said they
had difficulty getting through the strict security in the hotel
where the session was held, and the White House staff shuffled
reporters around to fill up empty seats in front rows.
   Once again, Reagan refused to say whether he would pardon Oliver
North or John Poindexter for their alleged roles in the Iran-Contra
scandal. However, he said the legal case against them ``has to go
forward or they would live the rest of their lives under a shadow
of guilt.''
   Immediately after his opening statement, Reagan was peppered
with questions about the investigation of alleged corruption at the
Pentagon.
   ``I think all of us are disappointed and upset that such things
could happen,'' Reagan said. Nevertheless, he said, ``I think it
should be understandable how such things can happen in something as
big as our government is.''
   Reagan added, ``But I think we also ought to recognize that
within our government ... it brought the units to which we entrust
such things'' to launch an investigation.
   The president said he did not want to leave the impression the
problem was minor. ``I don't feel that way at all. As a matter of
fact, I'm very upset. ... I'm not taking this lightly at all.''
   However, he said, it was the Pentagon, itself, ``that uncovered
and then proceeded to investigate and pin down where there was
guilt.''
   Prosecutors this week disclosed a widespread investigation into
alleged bribery and fraud in the Pentagon weapons purchasing
system, and disclosed that it used wiretaps that recorded more than
4,700 telephone conversations as part of the probe.
   Reagan said Caspar Weinberger, his longtime friend and defense
secretary for seven years until late in 1987, was ``one of the
finest'' Pentagon chiefs ever even though the alleged corruption
happened on his watch.
   He said he didn't think the affair would give Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis a boost in his race against
Republican George Bush.
   ``I don't think it really gives him any at all ... I don't think
this is a case at high levels,'' Reagan said.
   When a reporter asked whether a change in his management style
might have prevented the problem at the Pentagon, Reagan said he
doubted it. ``You can't be down there watching several million
people in the total of all of the companies and the Defense
Department every day in what they're doing.''
   His remarks on gun control were prompted by a question about an
incident in which columnist Carl Rowan shot a teenager who was
trespassing in his swimming pool in the middle of the night.
   Reagan said that at his ranch in California, he taught his
entire family how to shoot a gun ``in case they need to.''
   Reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system that
would require a background check before a person could purchase a
gun, to make sure they ``don't have a record of any crimes or
mental problems or anything of that kind.''
   In addition, he said, ``I think maybe there could be some
restrictions, that there had to be a certain amount of training
taken,'' Reagan added.
   On other matters:
   _ He said he doubted that record losses in the savings and loan
industry would add up to a crisis. ``I certainly hope not and I
don't think so,'' he said, although he conceded, ``there is a
problem there and we're trying to deal'' with it.
   _ Launched into a long defense of his handling of the
Iran-Contra affair reminiscent of his statements in the days and
weeks immediately after the scandal broke 18 months ago. He
defended his decision to seek ties with moderates in Iran, and said
he had worked as best and as quickly as he could to make the facts
of the diversion of funds to the Contra rebels public after he
found out about it.
   _ ``We love Canada,'' he said in thanking the host nation.

   An explosion and fire ripped through a
chemical processing plant in this southern England seaport Tuesday,
injuring at least 14 people and forcing the evacuation of more than
2,000 residents, police said.
   About 120 firefighters brought the blaze at BDH Chemicals under
control within one hour, officials reported.
   Dorset Police Supt. Bill Hanson said 14 people were treated at a
hospital after inhaling fumes and were released.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, reported that
an elderly couple driving past the factory when an initial blast
blew out a side wall were thrown out of their car by the impact. It
said they were not seriously injured.
   The blast shattered windows of nearby houses.
   ``There was one hell of a loud explosion,'' said Ken Wollan, who
was working in a neighboring building. ``It shook this building
right through. Drums of solvent were exploding, going through the
roof and shooting 75 feet into the air. Cars on a service station
forecourt were covered in bricks and blazing debris.''
   Police said more than 2,000 people, many of them elderly, were
evacuated from Poole Old Town, which dates to Roman times, when
smoke passed over the district as it drifted out to sea.
   Police said 11 different chemicals were involved in the fire,
but it was not immediately known what type all of them were.
   BDH Chemicals company secretary John Vass said firefighters had
prevented the blaze from spreading to a corner of a warehouse where
barrels of cyanide were stored.
   He said some of the barrels that exploded contained chlorine
solvents which, when set on fire, gave off highly irritating
hydrogen chloride gas.
   A police spokesman said residents were evacuated as a precaution
while authorities attempted to determine the possible danger of
chemical fumes.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, Dorset
police spokesman Brian Jones said.
   Poole is about 100 miles southwest of London.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
honored a Florida high school parent-teacher group Tuesday at the
National PTA Convention for staging the most effective AIDS
education program.
   In a speech to the annual convention, Koop also reiterated his
belief that parents and educators must teach youngsters about all
sexual practices that carry a risk of transmitting AIDS.
   ``I am deeply saddened that we must explain human sexuality ...
so that they do not contract the fatal disease, but we must,'' Koop
said. ``It is a life-saving message and we are duty-bound to
deliver it.''
   Koop presented the award to the Gainsville High School
Parent-Teacher Association for a project involving more than 100
faculty and school staff members, the 1,650-member student body,
parents and community members.
   The parent-teacher group, working with local health
professionals and school personnel, conducted a survey to learn
what students knew about the disease, and then arranged in-service
training for the school staff and coordinated a program for the
students.
   The Gainesville educators reported finding that students
significantly improved their knowledge about how to protect
themselves against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Koop noted that of the 65,000 reported AIDS cases in the United
States since 1981, most involved sexually active male homosexuals
or intravenous drug abusers who share needles.
   But the surgeon general emphasized that the disease will spread
into a broader population unless parents and educators encourage
young people to abstain from sex while in school and practice
monogamy as adults.
   If abstinence or monogamy isn't practiced, Koop said, young
adults must be made aware of the protection afforded by latex
condoms.
   Koop implicitly endorsed Utah's two-tiered AIDS education
program.
   The program offers one set of lessons for the general school
population beginning with the third grade, and separate, more
detailed lessons for children whose parents request it. The program
is designed to give detailed information without offending a small
but vocal minority that opposes any sex education.
   ``I've always said you cannot exceed community standards'' when
designing an AIDS curriculum,'' he said. ``Otherwise, it will never
fly.''
   Koop said the government's recent educational effort, an
eight-page pamphlet mailed to 107 million American households,
apparently got a favorable reception with the exception of a
``very, very few far-right-wing'' protesters.
   ``Judging from the number of people who've accosted me in
airports, everyone in the world has read it twice,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The military coup in Haiti will not
interrupt Haiti's efforts to regain millions of dollars allegedly
taken by dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier when he fled to France,
attorneys representing Haiti said Tuesday.
   A judge was to be selected Monday in this southern French city
to hear the case against Duvalier, accused of misappropriating $120
million in public funds.
   In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince on Monday, Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy re-established military rule by decree and named his own
government a few hours after ousting President Leslie Manigat's
civilian government.
   The coup crushed hopes for the democracy promised two years ago
after Duvalier was toppled, ending his family's 29-year
dictatorship.
   ``We are not lawyers for the government but for the Haitian
state,'' said attorney Yann Colin, who represents Haiti in its
French legal proceedings.
   In April a French court ruled it had jurisdiction in the case
against Duvalier.
   The Haitian national lottery, office of vehicle insurance,
gaming commission and Port-au-Prince Bank are demanding that
Duvalier and members of his entourage reimburse the government.
   Colin claimed the $120 million requested represents only part of
what Duvalier diverted.
   Since arriving in France Feb. 7, 1986, Duvalier has lived with
his wife, Michelle, and other family members in a luxurious mansion
in southern France rented from Saudi millionaire Adnan Kashoggi.
   Duvalier has declined to comment on political developments in
Haiti since his downfall.

<TEXT>
   China is both a land of opportunity and a
quagmire of bureaucracy, delay and high costs, American businessmen
were told Tuesday at a major trade and business conference.
   ``I think China is a super place to do business if you realize
there's no free lunch,'' William Kinch, head of Grace China
Limited, said during panel discussions at the U.S.-China Joint
Session on Industry, Trade and Economic Development.
   The conference has brought nearly 1,000 American businessmen to
the Great Hall of the People for discussions on doing business in
China.
   It is the largest business conference ever held in China and
reflects China's hopes that American money will play a major role
in its modernization drive.
   U.S.-Sino trade topped $10 billion last year.
   Kinch's company in Shanghai produces sealing compounds for cans
and was one of the first enterprises in China wholly owned by
foreigners.
   He said it took nearly three years of negotiations to establish
the company because of foreign exchange problems and the need to
receive approval from several ministries and offices, both in
Shanghai and Beijing.
   Attorney Jerome Cohen, a specialist on Chinese law, told
potential investors they must be certain they are negotiating with
people who have the business licenses and authority to sign
contracts.
   He said approval from a ministry for a joint venture does not
mean that the tax or customs offices will go along with the project.
   Roy King of H.J. Heinz Co., which produces baby food in southern
China, said inflation accompanying China's switch to
market-determined prices is becoming a serious problem, and any
equipment ``invented in the last 30 years will have to be
imported.''
   He said permits and licenses can take months to obtain because
of the ``very well developed bureaucracy,'' and joint ventures must
bring in people at great cost in the early stages because of the
lack of skilled Chinese personnel.
   American panelists also said low labor costs are offset by low
productivity and there is an absence of market-research skills.
   Chinese speakers emphasized the progress China is making. Yuan
Zhenmin, director of treaties and law in the Foreign Economic
Relations and Trade Ministry, said the government has moved
aggressively to pass laws governing foreign investments.
   Yuan said income tax, patent, joint-venture and trademark laws
passed in recent years have assured foreign businessmen of fair
treatment. China now has more than 10,000 joint ventures or wholly
foreign-owned enterprises.
   It is the first visit to China for about 95 percent of the
American businessmen.
   Ivy Joseph Breaux, operator of a centrifugal foundry in Temple,
Texas, said the Chinese ``are really trying to move very fast. I
really trust them.''
   ``The Chinese are very sincere,'' said Alberto Barrocas, a shoe
manufacturer from Miami. ``They are very conscious of the great
need they have for expanding their horizons in trade. They want to
make it happen.''

   A bus carrying members of a Michigan drum and
bugle corps was hit Tuesday from the rear by a semi-trailer truck,
injuring 36 people, authorities said.
   The bus, with 40 people aboard, had stopped for mechanical
problems on the Indiana Toll Road and was struck when it pulled
back onto the road around 3:30 a.m., said State Police Cpl. Ron
Johnston.
   The Northern Aurora Drum and Bugle Corps was returning to
Saginaw, Mich., from a competition in Mishawaka. The members range
in age from 14 to 21.
   ``Many of them aren't really sure what happened,'' said Steve
Stigall, an instructor who was riding on another bus. ``They were
asleep at the time.''
   A brief fire scorched the front of the truck cab on impact, said
Jackie Waskoviak, the wife of corps commander Robert Waskoviak.
   ``He looked in his rear-view mirror, and he did see flames, a
ball of fire is what he called it,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Saginaw after talking with her husband. ``It was out
very quickly.''
   Two young men were hospitalized, one for a concussion and
bruises and the other for a said broken wrist, hospital officials
said. Three other youngsters were treated at hospitals and released.
   The driver of the truck, Larry A. Noble, 46, of Clinton, Iowa,
was in stable condition at Parkview Memorial Hospital in Fort Wayne
suffering from a back injury and cuts, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The bus driver, Frank Davila, 56, of Freeland, Mich., was
treated at Sturgis Hospital and released, a spokeswoman said.
   Neither driver has been cited, said state police Lt. Ken
Hollingsworth.

   The government on Tuesday canceled aid
to Haiti and said it is talking with other Latin American nations
about collective action to re-establish democracy in that Caribbean
nation.
   President Jaime Lusinchi denounced the ouster of elected
President Leslie Manigat in Sunday's military coup. He said he was
pulling out Venezuelan aid workers sent to Haiti after the fall of
dictator Jean Claude Duvalier in February 1986.
   ``The ouster of President Manigat by Gen. (Henri) Namphy is
unacceptable for Venezuela and we are making all the necessary
consultations to promote collective action by Latin America to
correct this abnormal situation,'' Lusinchi told reporters at the
presidential palace.
   ``While Manigat will always be welcome in Venezuela, it is not a
question of hospitality but of re-establishing the democratic
system in this fellow nation,'' he said.
   Lusinchi said a corps of Venezuelan officials and soldiers sent
to Haiti in 1986 to help build roads and housing was recalled
Tuesday ``as a show of protest.'' He did not disclose the extent of
the Venezuelan assistance.
   Manigat was granted political asylum in the Dominican Republic
Tuesday. He had lived in exile in Venezuela in the 1970's.
   Foreign Minister German Nava is expected to discuss Haiti with
his Argentine colleague Dante Caputo, scheduled to meet with
Lusinchi in Caracas on Wednesday.

   Seven people were killed Tuesday afternoon
when their station wagon was struck by a freight train at a rural
crossing, and an eighth person collapsed and died trying to
resuscitate one of the victims.
   Two women and five children were killed when their car burst
into flames after the collision about eight miles west of Pittsburg
in southeast Kansas.
   Five of the accident victims were dead at the scene. One child
was pronounced dead at Mount Carmel Medical Center in Pittsburg,
120 miles south of Kansas City, and another died en route. Names of
the victims were not released.
   Joe Cobb, director of the Crawford County ambulance service,
collapsed and died of an apparent heart attack at the hospital
while trying to resuscitate one of the children, hospital spokesman
Collin Hermreck said.
   Cobb, 48, apparently went to the accident scene, where the
temperature was in the mid-90s, and returned to the hospital with
one of the victims, Hermreck said.
   ``Shortly after the victims arrived, he was helping resuscitate
one of the children. He collapsed and died,'' he said.
   Crawford County Sheriff Lynn Fields said the car was struck in
the passenger side door by a Burlington Northern freight train made
up of an engine and seven cars.
   The car was crossing the tracks about two miles northeast of
Cherokee. The crossing was not protected with lights or safety
gates.
   ``What we've found out so far is that the driver didn't even
look up,'' Fields said. ``So, apparently she didn't even see the
train.
   ``Other witnesses say the engine did blow its whistle and that
apparently the train did everything it could do to avoid the
accident. But the car was right on the middle of the tracks when
the train struck it.''
   Fields said the intersection has a clear view but that other
car-train collisions have been reported there.
   Lennie Westervelt, chief of the Rural Cherokee Fire Department,
said the car's gasoline tank exploded and the car was engulfed in
flames when firefighters arrived. The wooden railroad ties also
were on fire.
   Westervelt said there was nothing firefighters could do to help
the victims. All victims but one were thrown from the car.
   The rail cars remained upright and on the tracks. Officers at
the scene said there was a small fire in electrical wiring on the

   The government on Tuesday filed arms
smuggling charges against four former directors of the country's
largest weapons manufacturer.
   The Bofors AB executives were accused of selling 300
anti-aircraft missiles to Bahrain and Dubai in 1979 and 1980 in
violation of Swedish export regulations barring arms sales to
volatile regions.
   Folke Ljungvall, chief prosecutor of the city of Karlstad, said
he expected the case to come to trial later this year. If
convicted, the defendants could face prison terms ranging from six
months to six years, he told The Associated Press.
   Those charged after a four-year investigation were former
managing directors Claes-Ulrik Winberg and Martin Ardbo, former
sales director Lennart Palsson and Hans Ekblom who had headed the
export division.
   ``It's not the company that's being prosecuted,'' said Bofors
spokesman Per Mossberg. ``In today's Bofors there have been some
major changes, and the company is now stronger than it was before.''
   Critics have said the allegations of misconduct in arms exports
have undermined the credibility of Swedish neutrality and the
leadership role that it claims in advocating world disarmament.
   Ekblom said through his lawyer that the deal in which he was
accused of illegal practices had been approved by the director of
the War Materials Inspectorate, Rear Adm. Carl-Fredrik Algernon.
   Algernon was crushed to death by a subway train at Stockholm's
central station in January 1987, a week before he was to be
questioned in the case. Police said they suspected suicide.
   ``The war materials inspector (Algernon) was informed about all
steps I took,'' Ardbo said in a Swedish Radio interview.

<HEAD>Deaths Spur Recall, Manufacturing Halt For Mechanical Heart Valves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Baxter International has
stopped making two mechanical heart valves and recalled 6,000
unused devices after malfunctions caused six deaths, a company
spokesman said.
   Valve malfunctions in 12 patients were reported to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, and six of the malfunctions were fatal,
Walter Schneggenburger, who heads the FDA's Santa Ana office, said
Monday.
   The valves had been implanted in 20,000 patients, most overseas,
and all of the malfunctions occurred overseas. The valves were
approved for sale in the United States only in May 1987.
   ``Twelve malfunctions out of 20,000 is a very small number, but
it was disturbing enough for us to decide to do the prudent thing''
by halting manufacture of the two models, said Les Jacobson,
spokesman for Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter. The company's
Irvine-based Edwards Division makes the valves.
   Doctors have been urged to monitor closely patients who are
using the valves rather than have them removed, Schneggenburger
said.
   The recalled mechanical valves were marketed as Edwards
Duromedics Aortic Bileaflet Valve Model 3160 and Mitral Bileaflet
Valve Model 9120.
   The malfunctions occurred when gatelike ``leaflets'' regulating
the flow of blood through the valves broke loose, Schneggenburger
said.
   The Edwards Division is one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of
mechanical heart valve replacements and valves made of organic
tissue.
   The recalled valves are known as carbon bileaflet valves. Heart
surgeons have preferred them over other types of mechanical valves
in recent years, with an estimated 90 percent of mechanical valves
of the carbon bileaflet variety, said Pieter Halter, Edwards'
former sales and marketing director.
   Jacobson said the company stopped manufacturing the valves
shortly after it suspended their marketing May 16, and won't make
more of them until it can learn why they failed.
   The failed valves were made from 1983 through August 1986 by
Hemex Scientific _ which was acquired by Baxter in December 1986 _
at factories in Austin, Texas, and Shelkshine, Scotland.
   Jacobson said design of the valves was changed after the
acquisition, but it isn't yet know if those valves are less prone
to failure.
   Last year, Edwards' carbon bileaflet valves generated $12
million in sales for Baxter, a health products company with $6
billion in annual revenues.

   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of
France, who started the decade calling for a ``rupture with
capitalism,'' is still out of step with his summit colleagues as
they march to a fanfare of praise for free-market policies.
   Mitterrand and President Reagan have both attended the past
eight summits. While Reagan prepares for retirement, the
71-year-old Frenchman has just won re-election to a second
seven-year term.
   But the fresh mandate does not seem to have given Mitterrand
greater weight with his peers, or at least not enough to counteract
his isolation as the only leftist among the seven heads of state
and government wrapping up their three-day summit today.
   Mitterrand has abandoned the radical economic policies of
1981-83, his first years in office, but still is a long way from
singing harmony with his conservative colleagues _ especially
Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

   To commuters, it was inconvenient. For 100
political fringe groups, it led to the rally of a lifetime. But to
the growing subculture of street people in Canada's richest city,
the seven-nation economic summit was irrelevant.
   ``I don't really understand it. Are they trying to make more
money?'' said a 17-year-old girl with a Mohawk haircut who was
panhandling for change Monday opposite the Eaton Center, a
glittering mall on Toronto's main drag, Yonge Street.
   ``I've been out on the streets for three years,'' said the girl,
who identified herself as Sally. ``I don't even understand the
summit.''
   A few blocks east, young people slept on plastic sheets and
blankets in Allan Gardens, which like many Toronto parks provides
temporary haven in a city with a booming economy but the worst
housing shortage in the country.
   ``It's a side Toronto wants to cover up and ignore,'' said the
Rev. Rudy Mumm, an Oblate missionary who works with the city's
estimated 15,000 street people.

   This was supposed to be the year of
optimism, with debt down, spirits up and many farmers expecting
good crops and good prices in 1988. But now Wayne Wietbrock will
settle for less. Breaking even.
   Along with thousands of farmers across the Midwest, Wietbrock
has seen the drought curl corn leaves and trap soybeans under dried
chunks of cracked gray soil in his fields. A brief rain Monday, he
said, did little to help.
   Wietbrock, a third-generation grain farmer in northwest Indiana,
said if there's no break in the dry spell, he could lose 30 percent
of his corn.
   But he added: ``If I can break even ... I'll count myself OK. So
many farmers just went completely bankrupt. Maybe we feel good just
by staying where we are.''
   Still, the Midwest's worst drought in 50 years comes as many
farmers, having survived the mid-1980s' tough times, are finally
making a dent in their debt and starting back toward recovery.

   Women's groups and city officials around the

of private all-male clubs to women and minorities by upholding a
ban on exclusive membership policies.
   ``Hallelujah! We've been waiting for this for a long time,''
Mayor Edward I. Koch said Monday. ``Let's open up the doors to

   ``We feel it's one more nail in the coffin against
discrimination of women in this country,'' said Kelly Conlin,
president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for
Women.
   But members of some of the city's all-male clubs reacted angrily
to the high court decision upholding a 1984 New York City law.
   ``If men want to get together and have a club, what's wrong with
that?'' said a man heading into the New York Athletic Club. Like
all of the nearly two dozen members approached for comment Monday,
he refused to give his name.

   One figure implicated through wiretaps in the
Pentagon procurement bribery and fraud probe agreed within the past
few days to cooperate with the government and another is on the
verge of agreeing to tell what he knows, sources familiar with the
investigation said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci decided to
reassign six Pentagon officials under scrutiny in the
investigation. He directed that anyone whose activities come under
examination must be moved to different jobs that have nothing to do
with procurement.
   President Reagan, in a news conference in Toronto, Canada,
during the economic summit, said he was ``very upset'' about
reports of wrongdoing within the multibillion dollar defense
procurement industry.
   But he praised investigators for ferreting out the misdeeds, and
said it was ``understandable how such things'' could happen in a

   In scenes reminiscent of the Dust Bowl, the
unchecked prairie wind scratches precious topsoil from fields baked
dry and left unprotected by a relentless drought, then drifts the
dirt into ditches like snow.
   An estimated 3.5 million acres of North Dakota cropland have
each lost at least five tons of topsoil to wind erosion, a
four-fold increase in erosion from a year ago, according to the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service.
   Land is considered damaged by wind erosion if it loses at least
five tons an acre, an amount equal to a layer of soil as thick as a
dime spread over an acre.
   Worse, topsoil on millions of more acres on the Great Plains
could blow away this winter if the prolonged drought that is
destroying this year's crops doesn't end in time for some plants to
grow, officials say.

   Inflation slowed for the second month in a row
to an annual rate of 4.2 percent in May, the government said
Tuesday, with the Farm Belt drought yet to reach the grocery
shelves and consumers balking at paying more for clothing.
   Retail prices overall rose just 0.3 percent in May and food
prices were up only 0.4 percent, almost half their 0.7 percent
increase in April, the Labor Department said.
   Last month's increase in the Consumer Price Index, the smallest
since a 0.2 percent rise in February, slowed the pace of inflation
in May from a 5.3 percent annual rate in April and a 6.4 percent
rate in March.
   For the first five months of 1988, overall retail prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace as in 1987.

   Those claims were supported by the reports from diplomats, who
said Afghan troops were driven to the city limits and the Red Army,
which is leaving Afghanistan under an agreement signed April 14,
moved its men to the airport.

according to a federal study released Tuesday.
   In a study that included the oral examination of about 40,000

Research found that dental cavities have declined by 36 percent
among children ages 5 to 17, and that 49.9 percent of these
children had no tooth decay at all.
   Officials said the sample population examined was selected to
represent the approximately 43 million school-aged children in the
nation.
   Dr. James P. Carlos, chief of the epidemiology at the NIDR, said
that dental decay, a problem that has plagued humankind throughout
history, has been steadily declining since the use of fluoride
became widespread and that the trend probably will continue.

   Where were you the second week of 1969?
   A few baby boomers are bound to suffer mental gaps, but ``Try to
Remember'' on CBS, with host Charles Kuralt, refreshes the memory
Thursday with an hour of reminiscence about Woodstock, Apollo 11,
Hurricane Camille and riots in Belfast, among other events.
   The program is a compilation of archival footage but also
features present-day interviews with everyday people who
experienced or were changed by those events: a lab worker who was
quarantined along with the astronauts when she was exposed to
moondust, an Episcopal rector who clung to life as his church
flooded around him, two women who were tots when soldiers and guns
became a way of life in Ulster, and a member of the first black
commission in Green County, Ala., who was elected that week.
   ``Try to Remember'' is a one-hour pilot for a possible half-hour
series.
   There are obvious similarities to ABC's defunct ``Our World,''
the hour-long program of two seasons ago that looked back on
particular parts of certain years each week. Linda Ellerbee is
trying to resurrect it on public television.
   ``We just aren't trying to do the same thing,'' said executive
producer Shad Northshield. ``Notably, we have Kuralt, and that
makes it different. We aren't resting with explaining what happened
that week, but what happened with individuals, non-famous people,
and how their lives were changed by what happened that week.''
   ``Try to Remember'' is not a clone if for no other reason than
Kuralt and Northshield, the team largely responsible for the
distinctive style of the highly praised ``CBS Sunday Morning.'' A
show like ``Try to Remember'' is perfect for their thoughtful
eloquence.
   For instance, one segment of the hour consists of a long, silent
scan of the portion of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that bears the
names of the soldiers who died that week.
   The highlight for those who remember 1969 as a time of peace,
love and rock 'n' roll is previously unshown footage of Janis
Joplin performing at Woodstock.
   Kuralt interviews Martin Scorsese and his long-time collaborator
Thelma Schoonmaker about their documentary, ``Woodstock.'' Joplin's
set was not included in the movie, Scorsese said, partly because of
poor lighting, but mostly out of agreement with Joplin's
management, who for vague reasons didn't want it shown. It makes
great TV almost 20 years later.
   Northshield said the program will concentrate on the '50s, '60s
or '70s. ``The best week is one in which there was someting very
memorable and famous, but only maybe one thing, and then the rest
of the week has a lot of important and interesting things nobody
remembers,'' he said.
   One half hour has already been shot, and the staff is hard at
work researching, even though there is no series commitment as yet
from CBS. The network already has three hours of news in prime time
_ ``60 Minutes,'' ``West 57th'' and ``48 Hours'' _ and is under
pressure to get out of third place in the ratings.
   But the Writers Guild of America strike, in its third month, has
already forced CBS to delay the start of its fall season until
October, so a news show, whose writers are not covered by the
Guild, might get a lucky break in the fall.
   ``That's our only hope,'' said Northshield, ``that so-called
`miniseason' that will be in August, September, October. The summer
is going to last longer than usual. Even if the strike ended today,
it would be late October before they (the entertainment division)
could get anything on.''
   Northshield ideally would like to see the program as a periodic
short-run series of eight or 10 episodes.
   NBC will begin the TV season with wall-to-wall, prime-time
coverage of the Summer Olympics, and ABC plans to rerun its
midseason replacement shows. ``Try to Remember'' would not be a bad
alternative for CBS or its viewers.

   Elsewhere in television:
   PROGRAMMER'S PLAYHOUSE _ Concerned viewers can rest easy. ``CBS
Summer Playhouse'' is back on the air. The ``anthology'' made its
debut last summer with a series of decidedly unmemorable pilots
developed for the next season that didn't make it. CBS thinks the
series is educational because it gives viewers ``insight into the
programming process.'' In other words, if you think what they put
on is bad, you should see the ones that didn't make it. ...
   `FRANK'S PLACE' BACK _ One show that deserves to make it is CBS'
acclaimed ``Frank's Place.'' Viewers can get another chance to
catch this superb half-hour comedy when it begins repeats July 16.
The series is not on the fall schedule, but CBS promises it will
return midseason. This summer, it will follow ``Kate & Allie'' on
Saturdays, replacing ``High Mountain Rangers.''

   When your company's sales and earnings are
soaring, what's the problem? How to make the good times last.
   That is the textbook situation right now confronting Micron
Technology of Boise, Idaho, a manufacturer of computer memory chips.
   In the past few years, most American producers of so-called
dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAMs, were driven out of
the business by intense competition from large Japanese
manufacturers.
   Joseph Parkinson, Micron's chairman, has described what happened
then as ``a hailstorm of illegal selling of products here in the
U.S. at below their foreign-made cost to produce.''
   When the United States and Japan reached an agreement covering
international trade in the chips, however, Micron, as one of the
few independent survivors, was suddenly in the right place at the
right time.
   With supplies of chips reduced and demand getting stronger all
the time, prices spiraled upward.
   After posting large losses in its 1986 and 1987 fiscal years,
Micron recently reported a $54.65 million profit for the first nine
months of its fiscal 1988, through June 2, on revenues of $187.09
million.
   In the last five fiscal quarters, Micron's revenues have climbed
from $22.8 million to $29.5 million to $43.2 million to $53.3
million to $85.6 million.
   You can't turn things around so drastically without attracting
the attention of Wall Street analysts and investors.
   Micron's stock, with its ticker symbol DRAM, has made regular
appearances lately among the most active issues in the
over-the-counter market's National Market System. From a low of $4
last year, the stock has jumped to as high as $26 this month.
   The question facing Micron's management, customers and its
followers on Wall Street is what happens to chip prices from here
on. Will the shortage persist even as Micron adds a new plant next
year and other, bigger companies size up the profits to be made?
   Expert opinion runs the full range from yes to no. One analyst
queried by the New York Times maintained that ``the shortage will
last well into 1989 and I think it's going to get worse.''
   Said an industry official: ``It will ease toward the end of the
third quarter and will end in the fourth quarter'' of this year.
   In this kind of volatile, uncertain environment Micron has just
disclosed a strategy aimed at increasing the stability of its
business and enhancing its once-shaky standing.
   Parkinson, the chief executive, announced that the company would
offer to sell chips to customers under long-term contracts that
couldn't be canceled, rather than the short-term contracts that
cover most of its sales now.
   The move isn't, he asserted, an attempt to grab the brass ring
of higher prices while they last, but rather an effort to assure
``reasonable prices on the assumption it's a long-term
relationship.''
   Actually, Wall Street analysts who follow the company say,
Micron has more on its mind than prices.
   In offering contracts to the big names of the high-technology
world, they say, it is trying to improve its position with those
manufacturers, and is turning away to a significant extent from the
distributors to which it sold most of its chips in the past.
   Richard Whittington and Elizabeth Dorsey, analysts at
Prudential-Bache Securities, called the decision a ``prudent step''
for what Ms. Dorsey described as ``basically a one-product
company.''
   ``It lessens some of the volatility in their business and
enhances the likelihood of their long-term success,'' they said.

   In a curious inconsistency, most Americans
approve the slogan ``separation of church and state,'' but not its
results.
   Most favor public prayers before high school sporting events, a
moment of silence in schools for voluntary prayer and inclusion of
biblical perspectives about creation in discussions of evolution.
   Majorities also say public schools should allow student
religious groups to meet in classrooms in off hours and that it's
OK to put Christian or Jewish holiday symbols on government
property.
   These beliefs, along with approval of the ``separation'' phrase
exercised in prohibiting them, emerged from a nationwide survey of
3,017 Americans.
   The telephone survey, taken Dec. 1-15, 1987, for the
Williamsburg Charter Foundation, a private, non-profit,
non-sectarian project in Washington, D.C., gauged attitudes on
religion within politics and public affairs. The participants,
chosen at random, were 18 and older, and the survey had an error
margin of 2.4 percentage points either way.
   More than 100 prominent Americans were to join in a
reaffirmation of the Constitution's religious-freedom clauses at
the ``First Liberty Summit'' at Williamsburg, Va., on June 25.
   The event marks the 200th anniversary of Virginia's call for the
First Amendment's Bill of Rights.
   The survey findings indicated that in this presidential election
year, denominational bias about candidates has dwindled to a
remnant, in contrast to what it was 30 years ago.
   Only 8 percent of Americans would refuse to vote for a Roman
Catholic on the basis of religion, compared to 25 percent in 1958,
and only 10 percent would refuse to vote for a Jew, compared to a
previous 28 percent.
   However, 70 percent say it is important that the president have
strong religious beliefs, and more than 60 percent say they
wouldn't vote for an atheist or a homosexual.
   Only 43 percent, however, say they wouldn't vote for a candidate
who ``has been having other love affairs.''
   Public unfamiliarity with the actual grounding of the volatile
relationship of religion and government was seen in the survey
finding that only a third knew freedom of religion was guaranteed
by the Constitution's First Amendment.
   The phrase ``separation of church and state'' appears nowhere in
the Constitution, but it is held to be reflected in the Amendment,
which actually says:
   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
   In the survey, however, 54 percent favor ``laws against the
practice of Satan worship.''
   A bigger majority, 67 percent of those familiar with the
American Civil Liberties Union, thinks it files ``too many lawsuits
regarding religion,'' which often have figured in barring practices
most respondents approve.
   Sixty-eight percent think religous groups have a right to get
involved in politics, but 57 percent would prefer they didn't.
   Recent Gallup polls, summarized by the Princeton Religious
Research Center, find that 68 percent of the public favor a
constitutional amendment allowing prayer in public schools.
   Most think only a ``small percentage'' of people would be
offended.
   Sixty-two percent think it would be possible to develop school
courses on ethics and values that would be acceptable to most
residents of their communities.
   As for the professions the public trusts, clergymen still top
the list.
   In descending order below, come these groups:
   Druggists, doctors, dentists, college teachers, engineers,
policemen, bankers, TV reporters, funeral directors, newspaper
reporters, lawyers, stockbrokers, business executives, senators,
building contractors, local officeholders, Congress members,
realtors, state officeholders, insurance salesmen, labor union
leaders and car salesmen.

<HEAD>Limelight Is A Mixed Blessing, Hunthausen Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Being punished by the Vatican was not the kind of
notice wanted by Seattle's Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen, but he says it hasn't curbed his message.
   And listeners crowd around now to hear it more than before.
   ``Probably what I say will attract more attention,'' he said in
one of his rare interviews since his run-in with the Vatican,
adding that this makes him somewhat uncomfortable.
   At the same time, he said he feels that speaking out on
important issues such as poverty and peace ``is a responsibility
that is genuine in my life.''
   But he said he wants the spotlight on issues, not personalities.
``I want people to try to catch what I'm really saying and not
misinterpret,'' he said.
   Hunthausen, 66, whose full authority was restored a year ago
after it was curtailed by the Vatican for the previous year and a
half, has not backed away from his keen social concerns as a result.
   In his responsibilities as a bishop, he said, ``I don't feel any
constraints in what I think I should do and how I should do it. If
I'm at peace with the direction I feel I ought to pursue, I will
pursue it.''
   He has kept pushing causes he champions _ a higher state minimum
wage, low-income housing and nuclear disarmament. He continues to
withhold a portion of his federal income tax to protest the arms
race.
   He has appeared at protests at the Bangor nuclear submarine base
west of Seattle, chided state legislators that the $2.50 hourly
state minimum wage is ``an embarassment'' and criticized Seattle
city leaders for rampant downtown development at the expense of
low-income housing.
   Whenever Hunthausen appears at a public event, the news media
are there. Tourists flock to St. James Cathedral to hear his
soft-spoken but outspoken sermons.
   In disciplining him, Rome claimed he was too flexible about
granting annulments, general absolution for sins, intercommunion
with Protestants and letting gay Catholics meet in Catholic
churches.
   During the time his authority was limited, Vatican appointee
Bishop Donald Wuerl had charge of many diocesan functions.
   While the clampdown on Hunthausen pleased some conservatives, it
also sparked an outcry throughout the United States from priests,
nuns and lay Catholics.
   On May 26, 1987, a special commission of three U.S. bishops
assessing the situation announced that the Vatican had restored
Hunthausen's full authority, and a coadjutor bishop was being named
to assist him.
   The Vatican also transferred Wuerl, who has since been made head
of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
   Hunthausen has described the shared powers relationship as
painful, humiliating and confusing, but said that he now is at
peace and believes he and the church are stronger for the
experience.
   Since the restoration of his powers, Hunthausen and his
coadjutor, Archbishop Thomas Murphy, have divided up some tasks,
but Hunthausen has final authority in all archdiocesan matters.
   Hunthausen describes himself as ``a rather shy, retiring
individual.'' He is still clearly reluctant to talk about the past
situation which he called ``very painful, extremely painful.''
   While it hasn't shackled his words or actions, he said , ``Being
human, I suppose that I will never be totally unaware of that
experience. You just can't.''
   At the same time, he said, ``I don't have any regrets'' about
statements or actions than led to the controversy. He added that he
does not feel he is being watched by Rome.
   He has to meet with the three-bishop panel one more time, ``and
then hopefully within a few more months we will see the end of
that.''
   He emphasized that any speculation that a deal was made in which
he would retire soon and Murphy would take over is wrong.
   ``There's nothing at all (to that), absolutely nothing,'' he
said. There was ``just no deal, never any conversation on it. It
never even arose.''
   Hunthausen said he's now in better health than he was a few
years ago when he suffered a heart attack. He also has had prostate
surgery.
   Since then, he's taken pains to eat better and exercise daily,
including taking hikes in his beloved Montana whenever he goes home
to visit relatives.
   ``I wish I had been doing that all my life, because my energy
level is certainly better on the ski hill than it was,'' he said.
   Also, archdiocesan programs that got started under Hunthausen,
such as a reorganization of priests and lay deacons to provide
adequate service with a diminishing number of priests had to be put
on hold for a while.
   ``We're going to move on now to implement that,'' Hunthausen
said. ``It's something we would like to have done many many months
ago but we were in such a state of flux.''

   America's health care system could go
bankrupt unless physicians start refusing treatment to patients who
are terminally ill, says a Jesuit priest who is an authority on
medical ethics.
   The Rev. John J. Paris, professor of social ethics at Holy Cross
Hospital in Worcester, Mass. says medical experts estimate 270,000
Americans will develop symptoms of AIDS within the next three years.
   He told an audience of medical professionals that if the
projections prove accurate, the only way to avoid draining health
care resources will be for hospitals to give ``maximum medical
intervention'' only to patients for whom there is a ``realistic

   Zelda Rubenstein calls herself a character
actress _ a good character actress, though not in the same category
as a Meryl Streep.
   But she is proud of the featured roles she's played.
   ``I can make a lot of people very real. I like people and that's
going to have to show,'' said Rubenstein, who portrayed Tangina
Barrons in ``Poltergeist.''
   Rubenstein, who stands 4-feet-3, continues her role as the
medium for the haunted little girl, Carol Anne, in ``Poltergeist
III.''
   ``I loved `Poltergeist III,''' she said. ``I loved the script
and I loved the spirit of it.''
   Rubenstein was a latecomer to the film world. After a childhood
that she characterized as relatively normal, she earned a bachelor
of science degree in Life Science from the University of Pittsburgh
and spent 20 years working in a blood bank and as medical
technician.
   In 1980, she decided to travel.
   ``I did more dishes than I thought were manufactured. I worked
on a shrimp boat,'' Rubenstein recalled. ``I survived without
compromising my standards of morality. I learned about having to
use my wits. I got a lot of confidence out of traveling in Europe.''
   Rubenstein had long been interested in acting but only after
traveling did she decide to pursue a career. She had pictures taken
and put together a resume. She had three agents within a week, and
in another week, she had landed a job as one of the voices of the
``Flintstones Comedy Hour.''
   ``When television came I thought that it had tremendous
potential; the power of the medium is enough to exhaust you,'' she
said. ``Communications became more important as I matured. I just
decided I needed to do something creative.''
   Rubenstein broke into movies in 1981 with a supporting role in
``Under the Rainbow,'' which starred Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher
and several midgets and dwarfs. In 1982, she was cast in
``Poltergeist.''
   ``I only worked six days on that film: I came in; I did it; I
observed; I didn't ask questions; I did my job,'' she said. ``When
I saw the screening for cast and crew, I almost dissolved. I
suddenly realized that those six days had changed my life entirely.
Nothing, not a single word I had put into the film had been cut.
   ``I realized that I was in the middle of a very big film.''
   Rubenstein has nothing but kind words for the film's director,
Steven Spielberg.
   ``He's divine. He's very smart. An excellent director, very
companionable. If I'm guilty of doing anything blindly,''
Rubenstein said in her best stage whisper, ``it's loving smart
men.''
   Like many movie actors, Rubenstein found herself being
associated with her on-screen character.
   ``People stopped and asked if I would take a look at their home,
what would I do in this situation,'' she said. ``We have a very
gullible population. I find it totally annoying. I'm a very private
person.''
   Besides working in film and televison, she has appeared on the
stage, and currently is in a Washington production of ``The Cherry
Orchard.''
   After ``Poltergeist'' became a hit, a sequel was inevitable. But
the film's producers did not originally have Rubenstein in mind.
   ``I got a call indicating I would not be doing `Poltergeist
II,''' she said. ``I wished them well and I cried for about four
days. Then they called me to say that the actress was not doing it
and I could do the role.
   ``I was not happy with `Poltergeist II.' I thought it was
ill-conceived.''
   But Rubenstein was not through with Tangina Barrons. In November
1986 she went to see ``Wanted: Dead or Alive,'' a film directed by
Larry Sherman.
   ``There were some shots that were so directorally gorgeous, I
started crying in a movie that didn't warrant tears at that
point,'' Rubenstein said. ``So I made up my mind I would go meet
the director afterwards, if possible.''
   Rubenstein walked into the lobby and spotted Sherman standing in
the middle of a group of people.
   ``I went up to this man and I introduced myself and let him know
I was just in awe. He knew who I was,'' Rubenstein said. ``I shook
his hand and gave him a hug. He said he hoped I would be happy
because we would be working together soon. He was directing
`Poltergeist III.'
   ``I floated out of the studio.''

<HEAD>25-Year-Old Actor Plays Groucho Marx in `Animal Crackers' Revival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Frank Ferrante was 10, he saw his first Marx
Brothers movie.
   At 11, he dressed up as Groucho Marx on Halloween. As a
teen-ager, Ferrante pored over old magazine profiles of Groucho and
watched the movies over and over, mimicking the comic's
wisecracking, nasal voice.
   Now the 25-year-old Ferrante paints on a wide black mustache,
thickens his already bushy eyebrows and masquerades as Groucho
every night in a revival of the Marx Brothers' 1928 musical-comedy,
``Animal Crackers'' at Boston University Theater.
   ``I can't deny the fact that I'm attached to the man or the
character,'' Ferrante said. ``It's pretty overwhelming at times to
think how important his930s, TV quizmaster in
the '50s and octogenarian in the '70s. Groucho Marx died at age 86
in 1977.
   The show played off-Broadway in New York, where Ferrante won two
awards for best debut. It went to London for six months, closing in
May 1987, and Ferrante was nominated for comedy performance of the
year.
   ``I'm thinking, there's no way I can be Groucho Marx, but I can
come as close as humanly possible,'' Ferrante said in a dressing
room interview. ``My edge is that I was able to show him as a human
being. No one in the audience knew what he was like so I had to
create a credible personality.''
   Ferrante has read almost everything written about Groucho _ from
biographies to theater reviews in the Lincoln Center archives _ and
interviewed his relatives and friends. His ear pressed to the
speaker of an old record player as a youngster in Sierra Madre,
Calif., he studied Groucho's 1972 Carnegie Hall comeback
performance.
   ``You're able to understand his humor by analyzing his early
childhood _ the insult humor, the defensive humor, his attitude
toward women,'' he said. ``As the years went by I was able to
unravel this mystery known as Groucho Marx.''
   His most bizarre discovery was a 1967 episode of ``The Dating
Game'' featuring Groucho setting up his daughter with one of three
bachelors. In it, Ferrante saw Groucho smile.
   ``You never see Groucho Marx sincerely smile in any of his films
or even on his TV show. It's always a kind of sneer.
   ``I heard him sneeze once,'' he added. ``I practiced his
sneeze.''
   Arthur Marx said Ferrante cares about his father's life and
doesn't merely imitate the pat mannerisms _ the cigar-chomping, the
bow-legged walk, the shifty eyebrows, the one-liners.
   ``When Frank does it, it doesn't look like an impersonator,'' he
said. ``I don't know any other who has studied my father's life
like that. He has just lived it.''
   Arthur Marx gave Ferrante a pair of glasses worn by Groucho in
the movies, hats from his private life and the only remaining
snapshot of a print of Groucho in 1923 in the brothers' first
musical, ``I'll Say She Is.''
   In ``Animal Crackers,'' Ferrante plays Capt. Jeffrey T.
Spaulding, the African explorer, celebrating his triumphant return
from an expedition. The setting is a Long Island mansion, where
high society is a vehicle for the antics of Groucho, Harpo, Chico
and Zeppo.
   Like Groucho, Ferrante ad libs freely, goading the audience when
a joke flops or a piece of stage business is bungled. The voice
seems a little higher, but the movements appear identical.
   ``The character is great,'' he said. ``One second he's playing
mock coy, one second he's aggressive. He's constantly vacillating.
It's not as simple as it seems.''
   The Huntington Theater Company production is only the second
revival of ``Animal Crackers''; the first was in 1982 in
Washington. After closing here July 2, the show goes on to Atlanta.
Ferrante hopes Broadway will follow.
   Ferrante, who resembles a young Groucho, met the comedian _ ``my
idol, my hero'' _ at a Los Angeles book-signing in 1976.
   ``He was very slow-moving. He had had a stroke, and it was just
shocking to see him. I expected to see the Groucho Marx of `Duck
Soup.' He was just so old _ yet the wit was still there. He was up
there answering questions. It left an impact on me.''

   Carl C. Icahn conceded he lost the battle for
five seats on Texaco Inc.'s board after a New York investment firm
revealed it voted its key stake in favor of the oil giant's
management.
   Icahn had said he considered the 12 million votes cast by
Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co. to be the key block in the critical
proxy contest at the Texaco stockholder meeting on Friday.
   Icahn had no comment Monday on whether he would continue to
pursue his takeover bid for Texaco or sell out. Analysts estimated
he could make a profit of nearly half a billion dollars by selling
his stake.

slowly are beginning to recover from the damage done by allegations
that the sporty vehicles roll over too easily.

<TEXT>
   Pessimism in the wake of last week's OPEC
meeting continued to wash over the energy futures market, sending
oil prices skidding lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate oil, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 45 cents
Monday to close at $16 a barrel.
   John Azarow, a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said WTI
had not traded at such low levels since the end of March.
   The July contract was due to expire Tuesday, and this
contributed to the sharpness of the decline, said Jim Fiedler, a
trader with E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. The August
contract slipped 30 cents and the September contract fell 24 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, home heating oil
fell 0.46 cent a gallon to 43.18 cents and unleaded regular
gasoline slipped 0.50 cent to 49.47 cents a gallon.
   ``There was no new news'' to drive prices lower, Fiedler said.

   Fiedler said the market was pressured by liquidation of long

   The OPEC ministers, unable to reach a new agreement that would
have limited production and raised the price of oil, extended their
current accord for another six months. This was bad news for the
oil market because the cartel already exceeds the self-imposed
quotas contained in the agreement.
   Reports that Saudi Arabia was discounting the price of its crude
deepened the market's pessimism on Monday, Azarow said.

   Japanese consumer leaders contend lax government
enforcement of auto safety standards has allowed the sale of
thousands of unsafe vehicles in Japan _ including the Suzuki
Samurai, which also has come under fire in the United States.
   Consumer leaders here say Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. continued
selling the sport-utility vehicle even though it knew for at least
a year that the car was prone to roll over.
   Similar contentions about the rollover danger _ vehemently
denied by Suzuki _ have been leveled by the Consumers Union, a U.S.
private consumer product testing group that has called for the
banning of the vehicle.
   In Japan, ``The Transport Ministry almost entirely relies on
each manufacturer's voluntary compliance with the safety
standard,'' said Fumio Matsuda, a consumer activist who heads the
Japan Automobile Users' Union.
   ``The Japanese companies usually adhere to the ministry's
requirements faithfully. But if an unsafe car gets sold by mistake
or negligence, Japan has no way to control it because the Transport
Ministry has no adequate regulatory system,'' Matsuda said.
   Matsuda blamed the interdependent relationship between the
government and corporations, which often is perceived as an
advantage for Japanese companies over foreign competitors, for
leading to dangerous conditions.
   Matsuda said Suzuki ignored his complaints for more than a year
after he contended the cars were vulnerable to rolling over during
sudden turns.
   ``I pointed out to company officials last year that the car's
high center of gravity and the narrow width can make the car
unstable,'' Matsuda said. ``But they told me they were aware of the
problem. Apparently they were not taking the matter seriously.''
   Although the Japanese government does not keep statistics, a
number of accidents involving the car have been reported in Japan
since manufacturing began in 1970, according to newspaper reports.
Since 1981, when production of the current model began, the company
has sold 120,000 of the vehicles in Japan.
   The Samurai _ sold in Japan as the Jimny _ originally was
designed for a 360 cubic-centimeter engine. The model exported to
the United States has a 1,300 cubic-centimeter engine, an upgraded
version which the company started producing in 1984.
   ``Upgrading the size of an engine requires larger tires, which
will inevitably lift the center of gravity of the car,'' said
Matsuda, who is a mechanical engineering specialist. ``And with a
stronger horsepower, the upgraded model requires a more stable
structure. They should have gone back to the designing stage and
restructured the car from scratch. But the 1,300cc model is only a
enlarged model of the smaller one.''
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., Suzuki's U.S. subsidiary,
vigorously has defended the safety of the Samurai and attacked the
credibility of the Consumers Union testing. The Samurai has a lower
rate of rollovers than several other sport-utility vehicles, the
company says.
   Analysts and engineers have asked the Transport Ministry to
review its safety regulations and enforcement before the Japanese
auto industry suffers severe damage to its reputation in overseas
markets.
   ``If the Transport Ministry does not change its loose attitide,
there will be more cases similar to the Suzuki overseas,'' said
Yoshiro Hoshino, a professor at Teikyo University, who follows
automobile safety issues. ``Unlike in Japan, traffic accidents are
strictly investigated in the United States and any safety defects
will be a target of legal action.''
   The Transport Ministry recently said it would recall the vehicle
in Japan only if Suzuki decided to recall it in the United States.
   ``Japanese automobile companies have been so image-conscious in
the past decade that the Transport Ministry really did not need to
worry about the quality or safety standards of automobiles made by
Japanese manufacturers,'' said Hoshino, who specializes in
mechanical engineering.
   ``But as a result, the Transport Ministry failed to develop an
adequate checking function for the safety of automobiles.''
   But Transport Ministry officials say the current system works
well.
   ``Japanese manufacturers are fully aware of our safety standards
and strictly comply with them. I don't think Japan's safety
standard is at all inferior to that of the United States and
European countries,'' said the ministry's Masayuki Shima.
   Hoshino and Matsuda said the core of the problem lies in
enforcement, not in the standards. Shima acknowledged the ministry
did not conduct a maneuvering safety test with the Samurai because,
based on data submitted by the company, it did not believe the test
was necessary.
   Hoshino said an excessive confidence in quality may be making
Japanese manufacturers arrogant.
   ``I am beginning to sense that Japanese makers often think their
products could not be defective because they are so confident in
their quality control,'' he said. ``And it is resulting in their
unwillingness to check the vehicle's safety.''

   Suzuki Samurai dealers say sales of the popular sport vehicle
are showing early signs of a comeback from the damage done by
assertions that it rolls over too easily.
   In an Associated Press survey, the nation's top 10 dealers
predicted their June sales would be off by as little as a tenth to
more than half because of the critical June 2 report by Consumers
Union.
   ``For the first three or four days we had just literally no
traffic,'' said John Alexander, general sales manager of McDavid
Suzuki in Houston, the nation's No.10 dealer. ``But time is
helping. Time is the big healer.''
   Separately, Consumers Union said Monday that it received a June
11 letter from American Suzuki Motor Corp. demanding a retraction
of its report, but rejected it, writing back that its report was
``wholly fair and accurate, and based upon properly conducted
tests.''
   Dealers contend the people who still are buying Samurais are
skeptical of the Consumers Union report and are confident the
sport-utility vehicle is safe as long as it is driven sensibly.
   ``Believe it or not, it's beginning to turn around already,''
said Mickey Rhines, a salesman for the nation's No.1 Suzuki
dealership, Earnhardt Suzuki in Tempe, Ariz.
   Consumers Union gave the Samurai its first ``not acceptable''
rating for a vehicle in 10 years after concluding the Samurai's
high center of gravity and light weight gave the vehicle a
hazardous propensity to roll over if a driver swerved to avoid an
accident.
   American Suzuki claims Consumers Union, the Mount Vernon,
N.Y.-based publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, used ``biased
and completely inaccurate'' procedures in its tests, which were
widely publicized.
   Dealer estimates of the publicity's damage ranged widely, and it
was not possible to verify their statements independently.
   The top 10 accounted for 12 percent of all sales this year
through May by the company's 206 U.S. dealers.
   American Suzuki Motor says it would have no statement until July
6 about its June sales of the Samurai, its only car sold in the
United States.
   The dealers' response has ranged from the cautious _ some cut
back on advertising _ to the lighthearted.
   In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, Ga., Mark Singleton Suzuki
put up a sign saying, ``Stop By, You'll Flip Over Our Deals.'' The
word ``flip'' was upside down.
   The Georgia dealership, ranked No.5, also went ahead with plans
made before the Consumers Union report for a bikini beach party
featuring swimsuit-clad women and a pair of Suzukis parked on top
of a huge sandpile.
   Crabtree Suzuki of New Rochelle, N.Y., not one of the top 10,
ran full-page newspaper ads featuring contented customers saying
why they liked the Samurai. An example: ``It's so easy to handle,
just like my monthly payments.''
   American Suzuki provided dealers with video cassettes of
Samurais successfully handling obstacle courses at high speeds as
well as information about the vehicle's safety record.
   Dealers said customers who came to the showrooms were willing to
be convinced.
   ``People are getting tired of Consumers Union telling them they
can't ride three-wheelers and they can't ride quad-runners,'' said
Mark Muller, the general manager of ninth-ranked John Chezik Suzuki
in the St. Louis suburb of St. Charles, Mo.
   ``We tell them, `Hey, you don't drive it like a sports car,'''
said Richard McGhee, general manager of Suzuki Northeast in
Columbus, Ohio, the No.3 dealer.
   ``If you go out and drive the vehicle like an idiot, well then
of course you're going to have idiotic results,'' said Earnhardt's
Rhines.
   Three-wheelers and quad-runners are all-terrain vehicles that
have been criticized for their instability, and Consumers Union has
said consumers should be offered full refunds on returns of them.
   Muller said he may have a near-record month for profit in June
because he saved thousands of dollars by halting advertising.
   ``The people that would be the most concerned with this would be
uneducated. That's not our market to start with,'' said Jim
Hardison, assistant sales manager of Beaman Suzuki in Nashville,
Tenn., the No.6 dealer.
   ``The educated buyer will not only read the Consumers Union
report, but they'll read other reports as well,'' such as favorable
reviews in the auto magazines, said Keith Hugger, sales manager of
Bell Suzuki in Rahway, N.J., the No.4 dealer.
   ``I don't have any second thoughts at all about selling this
vehicle,'' Hugger said.

<HEAD>Icahn Evaluating Options After Conceding Defeat in Texaco Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A major defeat in his battle to force a buyout
of Texaco Inc. won't necessarily cost Carl C. Icahn a profitable
campaign, should he decide to sell his stake in the oil giant.
   Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder, is mulling whether to
continue his attempts to force a buyout of Texaco in the wake of
his defeat in a critical proxy battle for five seats on the
company's board of directors.
   Whatever his strategy, the corporate raider won't walk away
crying: analysts estimate Icahn could reap upwards of $450 million
in profit if he sells his 14.9 percent stake in Texaco to a third
party.
   Icahn conceded Monday that he lost the proxy battle after the
New York investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co. revealed it
voted its 12 million shares _ a 4.9 percent stake _ in favor of
Texaco management.
   Saying he considered the Kohlberg Kravis stake the crucial
``swing vote'' in the contest, Icahn said: ``The closeness of the
race was indeed gratifying. I am, of course, sorry that I did not
win, but so be it.''
   Several large institutional investors had said previously that
they also voted in favor of management.
   It will take several weeks to actually sort out and count the
votes cast in the proxy fight.
   A Texaco spokesman said only that the company was ``gratified
that Kohlberg Kravis has voted ... in favor of management.''
   Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, sought the board seats as a
lever to pressure Texaco management into letting shareholders vote
on his proposal to buy the company for $60 a share, a bid that
values the company at $14.6 billion.
   Spokesman Neil Call said Icahn now is mulling ``whether to hold
the shares, sell, go for a hostile offer or look for a partner.''
   Icahn previously had said he would sell his shares if he lost
the proxy battle, but in the days before the annual meeting hinted
he might launch a hostile tender offer for Texaco.
   ``The ball's in Texaco's court _ if they want a discussion,''
Call said.
   Analysts said a third-party sale would be a logical scenario.
   ``He'll make at least $450 million in profits (by selling the
stock), so don't feel sorry for Mr. Icahn,'' said Bruce Lazier, an
analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. He based his calculations
on Icahn's having paid about $35 a share for his stake and a
theoretical sale at about $50 a share.
   When considering Icahn's rate of return, ``he didn't do badly at
all,'' said Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. ``The stock
would have to fall very, very low before he starts losing money.''
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texaco fell
$1.12{ a share to close at $46.87{, following Friday's drop of
$1.50 a share. It was the most actively traded issue, with more
than 2.6 million shares changing hands.
   Analysts believe Icahn was unable to muster enough institutional
support because of widespread skepticism about his ability to
finance the deal. Furthermore, investors typically resist voting
against management, particularly when a major reorganization is in
progress.
   Texaco management also skillfully drove home its restructuring
efforts by announcing on the eve of its annual meeting a $1.28
billion deal to sell 50 percent of its refining and marketing
operations in 23 states to Saudi Arabia.
   Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement that it backed Texaco
because it was impressed by the restructuring so far.
   The keystone of Texaco's restructuring plan was a $3 billion
payment to Pennzoil Co. to settle a lawsuit resulting from Texaco's
1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. after Pennzoil had made earlier
moves to acquire Getty.
   In addition, Texaco has begun selling off up to $5 billion worth
of marginally profitable assets, and a $1.7 billion distribution to
shareholders also is planned.
   Kohlberg Kravis sold its 4.9 percent stake in Texaco before the
meeting but retained its voting rights because it owned its shares
on record date for the shareholder vote.
   A spokesman said the firm remained ``interested in (Texaco's)
progress and hopes to maintain an ongoing dialogue with Texaco.''

   The advertising agency BBDO has won six Clio
awards for television commercials, including two for a Diet Pepsi
ad starring actor Michael J. Fox and two for commercials for Apple
Computer products.
   BBDO, which also won Clios for a corporate ad for DuPont and a
retail services ad for PIP Printing, won more television awards
than any other agency in the U.S. television advertising segment of
the Clio competition.
   The award-winning work came from BBDO offices in New York and
Los Angeles.
   Awards were announced Monday.
   Chiat-Day Advertising, with offices in New York and Los Angeles,
won five television Clios, including two each for ads for Arrow
shirts and the regional telephone company Nynex. The fifth was an
ad for Foster Farms Chicken.
   The television Clio for the best national advertising campaign
went to the agency Cliff Freeman & Partners, based in New York, for
a series of ads for Philips Light Bulbs that show what can go wrong
when a bulb burns out.
   One of the ads showed a matronly woman wondering where the magic
has gone in her marriage as her husband slurps his soup at the
dinner table. After the light goes out, a snore, then a splash and
finally a gurgle can be heard as the old man apparently dozes off
into his soup.
   Two production houses, Pytka of Venice, Calif., and Rick Levine
Productions of New York, each won four Clios for television ads.
   Pytka won for its work with BBDO on the Apple computer ads in
the home entertainment and office equipment categories, for a
commercial for Bartles & Jaymes wine cooler and for an ad for
Perrier water.
   Levine won three Clios for its work with BBDO on the Diet Pepsi
ad called ``Apartment 10G'' that showed Fox scrambling out his
apartment window and across traffic in a driving rain to get a soft
drink for a pretty neighbor.
   Levine's fourth Clio was for its work with BBDO on the DuPont ad
called ``Bill Demby'' that showed a man who had lost his legs in
Vietnam playing basketball with his friends with the aid of
protheses, or artificial legs.
   Clio Awards, a private concern based in New York, had been
administering the Clio presentations for 29 years.

for fresh oranges and orange juice shipments, officials say.
   ``We have the potential for similar growth in orange and orange
juice that we have had with grapefruit,'' said Lee Bouldin,
international marketing director for the Florida Department of
Citrus.
   Florida grapefruit exports to Japan doubled in the past two
years following the removal of import quotas on that fruit. And
Bouldin foresees the possibility of equally good results with fresh
oranges and orange juice once the quotas are eliminated for those
two products.
   The trade agreement announced Monday in Tokyo by U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter calls for a phasing out of import
quotas for oranges by 1991 and for orange juice by 1992. Tariffs on
fresh grapefruit will be reduced over the next two years.
   ``It's clearly beneficial...a positive step forward for the
Florida industry,'' said Robert Behr, director of economic research
for the citrus department.
   If Florida's share of the Japanese market remains the same, ``we
can expect almost a five-fold increase in sales of orange juice to
the Japanese,'' said Behr.
   Florida's biggest competitor on the world market is Brazil.
   Japan is Florida's largest export market for fresh grapefruit,
and lowering tariffs will help any potential oversupply, Behr said.
   Florida has a bumper grapefruit crop this year and expects
record harvests into the 1990s.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department said total American citrus sales
to Japan could increase from $50 million to $150 a million a year
when the quotas are lifted. Yeutter said the agreement could double
U.S. exports of beef and oranges to more than $1 billion annually.
   American exports of fresh grapefruit to Japan totaled almost $90
million from January through November 1987, with most of that
coming from Florida, Behr said. This compared with $74 million for
all of 1986.
   For the current season, Florida growers have shipped 11,390,000
cartons equalling about 42 pounds each of fresh grapefruit to
Japan, Bouldin said. This compared with just under 9 million
cartons in the 1986-87 season and 6 million in the 1985-86 season.
   Executive Vice President Bobby F. McKown of Florida Citrus
Mutual said the agreement is beneficial ``in the short-term and the
long-term.''
   Florida Citrus Mutual, which is the state's largest grower
cooperative, and other state citrus groups helped pressure Japan by
filing a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
charging Japanese orange and orange juice quotas were illegal under
the international trading system.
   McKown estimated that because of the agreement frozen
concentrate orange juice sales to Japan could go as high as 80
million gallons a year. Florida's total annual juice shipments,
domestic and foreign, now are about 210 million gallons.

   The economic summit, torn between U.S. ambitions
and the caution of the West Europeans and Japan, bogged down Monday
over President Reagan's call for an end to agriculture subsidies by
the year 2000.
   ``The situation is delicate. The discussions are very intense,''
a senior Canadian official said as negotiators searched late into
the night for a compromise between what he termed ``extreme
positions.''
   ``There may be the possibility of movement, and there may not,''
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Negotiators for the seven industrialized democracies and the
European Community sought a formula to accommodate conflicting
stances in advance of crucial General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) talks in December in Montreal.
   The declaration on farm subsidies, which ranked with Third World
debt as a major economic issue at the three-day gathering, was
expected to be included in the final communique that will be
released Tuesday afternoon.
   West German sources said the communique would contain no
reference to the United States plan for the elimnation of all
subsidies by the year 2000.
   A Canadian official said the officials faced ``a long night''
working on the farm subsidy draft after the Europeans stuck to
their position that the subsidies must be curtailed, but cannot be
eliminated.
   ``It is totally unrealistic,'' British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said of the U.S. plan.
   ``I think that it scares farmers in most parts of the world
unnecessarily if you do talk in terms of abolishing all government
support, all subsidies, by the year 2000,'' Lawson added in a
television interview.
   ``On the other hand, we have got to have some form of
multilateral disarmament on this issue.''
   British officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, during
an hour-long closed session on the subsidy issue, urged the United
States and Canada to give the 12-nation European Economic Community
credit for its moves since 1984 to cut subsidies.
   At a special meeting last spring, the EEC instituted a system of
automatic subsidy cutoffs if farmers exceeded their production
quotas.
   But the West European agriculture remains heavily subsidized.
The farm program consumes two-thirds of the EEC's budget.
   EEC President Jacques Delors urged the leaders during Monday's
session to implement past pledges to curtail subsidies rather than
endorse the U.S. plan.
   ``There is a limit to what you can ask farmers to do,'' Delors'
spokeswoman, Francoise Le Bail, said Monday evening.
   According to figures produced by the 24-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, Japan provided a 75 percent
subsidy for its agriculture in 1986, compared with 54 percent in
1980. European Economic Community subsidies totaled 49 percent in
1986, up from from 36 percent in 1980. U.S. subsidies were 35
percent in 1986, up from 15 percent in 1980.
   Britain, France, Italy and West Germany, the four European
nations taking part in the summit, are all members of the EEC.

<HEAD>Federated Lost $129 Million In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. posted a $129
million net loss in its first quarter, largely due to costs
stemming from its unsuccessful battle to prevent a takeover by
Campeau Corp.
   Federated, which was acquired by Campeau last month following a
months-long battle, indicated its results during the quarter ended
April 30 included charges of $88.7 million related to tender offers
for Federated stock and of about $167 million before taxes for
stock option settlements, ``golden parachute'' severance agreements
and other payments stemming from the change in control.
   The figures were included in a financial statement Federated
submitted Monday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New
York Times reported.
   Cincinnati-based Federated had posted a profit of $50.1 million
in its first quarter of 1987.
   Excluding the takeover costs, Federated's profit declined to
$21.5 million during the latest first quarter. Sales fell to $2.45
billion from $2.46 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   Quarterly results included the sale of four Federated store
divisions following the change in control, but did not include a
charge for a $60 million ``breakup fee'' provided for rival bidder
R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. when it agreed to withdraw in favor of Campeau.

<HEAD>Management Takes Lumps From Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc.'s dissident
shareholders say they are confident of winning a crucial proxy
battle for control of the troubled company's board of directors.
   The group, led by the New York investment firm Spear, Leeds &
Kellogg, is seeking seven seats on Allegheny International's
13-member board in order to oust Chairman Oliver S. Travers and
push an alternate Chapter 11 reorganization plan.
   Results of Monday's vote are expected to be released July 5,
Allegheny International said.
   The dissident group complained Monday that the management's
proposed reorganization plan could dilute their holdings by 75
percent.
   Martin Whitman, a New York adviser to Spear, Leeds & Kellogg,
said his preliminary plan would infuse $50 million from outside
sources, pay holders of the company's public debt more than market
value on their investments and exceed management's plan for
shareholder equity.
   But management defended its reorganization plan, which was filed
Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   ``When you look at companies that go through the reorganization
process, dilution is almost always a factor,'' Travers said.
   Management of the consumer products company recently told
shareholders that Bennett LeBow, the investor Spear, Leeds &
Kellogg recruited to help produce a competing plan, diluted
shareholders' equity by 80 percent in his reorganization of Western
Union Co.
   The management plan would leave current common shareholders with
a 25 percent interest in the company. If approved by shareholders
and the court, full payment would go to unsecured creditors in the
Sunbeam Corp., Sunbeam Holdings Inc., and Almet-Lawnlite
subsidiaries.
   The parent company's secured bank creditors, led by Mellon Bank,
would received full payment in cash. Other creditors would get
cash, notes based on contingent asset sales and common stock.
   Among current shareholders, those with common shares would end
up with 9 percent of the company, holders of $2.19 preference
shares would have 5 percent and holders of $11.25 preferred shares
would have 11 percent.
   Travers, meamwhile, told the shareholders the company plans
legal action if necessary to recover $32 million in loans made at 2
percent interest during the early 1980s.
   He said the investment bankers at Smith Barney appraised
Allegheny International at $663 million.

<HEAD>GM to Produce Two Concept Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it plans to market two
of its flashiest concept cars _ the Pontiac Banshee and Chevrolet
Venture _ by the early 1990s.
   The cars are on display at the automaker's Teamwork and
Technology exhibit, which ends today in Warren.
   The exhibit kicked off a national tour in New York in January
and has traveled to Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Atlanta. Its
last scheduled stop will be in Toronto later this month.
   A senior GM official, who asked not to be identified, told the
Detroit Free Press in today's editions that the concept car
announcement is unusual because most of those cars never go beyond
the prototype stage.
   ``Our goal when we went into this was not to build a car that
was so far-fetched that we wouldn't be able to actually build
one,'' said Marietta Kerney, GM senior creative designer. ``We're
looking now at building a car that's very, very close to what
you're seeing right out here.''
   The concept cars were developed last year in an effort to dispel
criticism that many GM cars look alike and establish distinct
differences in the automaker's marketing divisions, said Stan
Wilen, executive designer for GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac Canada Group
and the Saturn Corp.

<HEAD>Commodities Still Higher; Japan-U.S. in Trade Pact</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: leads with 6 grafs with consumer price report, picks up 3rd
graf, Wheat futures</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices, led by large increases for gasoline and
automobiles, climbed a moderate 0.3 percent in May, the Labor
Department said today.
   The increase followed gains of 0.5 percent in March and 0.4
percent in April and would amount to an annual inflation rate of
4.2 percent if prices climbed at the same pace for 12 months, the
government said.
   For the first five months of 1988, retail prices were rising at
an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace as in 1987.
   There was no evidence that effects of the Midwestern drought
reached consumers in May. Grocery prices rose just 0.4 percent,
compared with a 0.6 percent increase in April.
   But on Monday, commodities prices were pressured still higher by
the merciless drought.
   Grain and soybean futures prices jumped sharply higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Except for wheat, all grain and soybean
futures shot up their daily allowable limits at the opening bell.
   Wheat futures were influenced less by the drought than were
corn, oats and soybeans because the winter wheat crop, which
accounts for 75 percent of U.S. production, is nearly finished
growing and is being harvested.
   After the close of trading, the National Weather Service issued
a six-to-10-day forecast predicting above-normal temperatures and
below-normal rainfall for the Grain Belt in the first five days of
next week.
   The stock market followed its busiest day of the year Friday
with one of its slowest, amid fears of higher inflation due to the
drought and of rising interest rates.
   Stock prices weakened as volume on the New York Stock Exchange
dropped to 116.75 million shares, the slowest since May 23. It was
about one-third the volume of the year's record high of 343.92
million shares traded Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished at 2,083.93,
down 20.09. Broader market indicators also fell.
   Elsewhere, bond prices were nearly unchanged from Friday; the
dollar strengthened against most currenices and gold prices fell
slightly.
   In Tokyo, the United States and Japan announced a trade
agreement that could double U.S. exports of beef and oranges to
more than $1 billion a year.
   ``My judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark
agreement in U.S.-Japan economic relations,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said Monday following marathon talks
with Japanese leaders.
   The agreement calls for Japan to nearly double its imports of
beef by 1991, and phase out involvement by the Livestock Industry
Promotion Corp., which currently controls most beef imports. Japan
would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991, 60 percent
in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow Japanese farmers time to
adjust.
   Japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22,000
tons annually, to 192,000 tons in 1990. After that, fresh oranges
from the United States would be permitted in unlimited quantities,
at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent
off season. Quotas on orange juice also will be phased out.

<NOTE>Eds: will be led with closing figures</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices headed higher Tuesday on the London
Stock Exchange despite a weak opening, with traders shrugging off
losses in Tokyo and New York.
   Traders described the turnaround from a slight retreat at the
opening as evidence of the market's underlying bullishness.
   ``We aren't just following New York and Tokyo,'' said one
trader. ``The tone here actually looks quite good.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 8
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,852.0 at about noon local time, its
high for the day.
   Volume was 211.9 million shares, up from 155.2 million shares at
the same time on Monday.
   The market's turnaround came amid news that the Deutsche
Bundesbank, as expected, raised the interest rate on securities
repurchase agreements to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent.
   Many London traders said the rise in West German rate means that
a hike in the British commercial banks' base lending rate can't be
far behind.
   Despite the jitters felt last week over the prospect of higher
interest rates, traders said Tuesday that the market appears well
prepared for such a move.
   ``We might even move higher (after a rate hike) as people heave
a sigh of relief and get on with it,'' said one trader.

   Nestle controls 15.8 percent of Rowntree, while Suchard controls
29.9 percent of the British company's shares.

   Belgium's national airline, Sabena,
announced Tuesday that ordered 16 Boeing 737s as part of a plan to
renew and expand its fleet.
   Sabena Chairman Carlos Van Rafelghem declined to disclose the
value of the deal at a news conference, and company officials said
financing had not yet been worked out.
   In a statement, the state-controlled company said it would have
``a completely renewed'' short and medium-haul fleet by 1992, the
year the European Economic Community is due to create a single
market with freedom of movement for persons, goods, services and
capital.
   The order is for four 144-seat Boeing 737-400s and 12 111-seat
Boeing 737-500s. The aircraft will be delivered at the beginning of
the 1990s.
   The latest order plus previously placed orders for seven
126-seat Boeing 737-300s will bring Sabena's short and medium-haul
fleet of Boeing aircraft to a total 23 aircraft by the early 1990s,
the company said.

<HEAD>Ministers Adopt Safety Measures For Summer Rush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation ministers of the 12-nation
European Economic Community have adopted emergency measures aimed
at improving air safety before the summer travel rush, officials
said Tuesday.
   The ministers agreed to set up a ``red alert'' telephone link
among Europe's five busiest airports: London, Frankfurt, Paris,
Rome and Madrid.
   In addition, a crisis center coordinating all West European air
traffic during the four or five busiest weekends of the summer is
to be established.
   The ministers were told during their meeting Monday that several
potentially serious air mishaps were narrowly averted in Britain,
Spain and Greece over the past few months because of overcrowded
skies.
   Proposals for more radical safety measures are to be considered
in October when the EEC transportation ministers meet again.
   The ministers' decisions were based on a report by civil
aviation directors in the 12 EEC countries that said air control
services were understaffed and ill-equipped.
   The report also called for linking the data banks of all of
Europe's air control centers, harmonizing computers and radars and
opening more of Europe's military air space to civil aviation.
   It also estimated that by the year 2000, the number of flights
throughout Europe will have doubled from present levels.

   Honda Motor Co. says it intends to develop a car
that would be sold exclusively in the United States.
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda R&D Co., the company's
research division, said such plans represent a departure from the
company's worldwide philosophy.
   In the past, Honda cars have been designed in Japan and sold
throughout the world with few modifications.
   Kawamoto also said during a news conference Monday that Honda
will remain in the subcompact car market despite shrinking profits
and increased competition from developing nations, such as South
Korea, Taiwan and Brazil.
   To remain competitive in this market, Honda will experiment with
several cost-saving measures, including increasing automation at
its new assembly plant at Marysville, Ohio, Kawamoto said.
   The appreciation of the Japanese yen, which has doubled in value
against the dollar over the last three years, is resulting in an
expansion of research and engineering facilities in the United
States, Kawamoto said.
   While Honda has no timetable for production of the totally
American car, Kawamoto said it would begin in the near future.
   ``As far as complete development, I think it will take time,''
he added.

<HEAD>Rival Shareholders Try To Forge Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival shareholders in Societe Generale
de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, have begun
negotiations to try to reach an agreement on the future management
of the company.
   A dramatic and lengthy battle for control of Societe Generale
ended in April with a narrow victory for a group led by the French
company Cie. Financiere de Suez over Italian financier Carlo De
Benedetti, who had started the fight.
   At the special meeting two months ago, shareholders spurned De
Benedetti's bid to win board seats for himself and two allies,
dealing him a severe blow in his attempt to take over Societe
Generale, which controls a third of the Belgian economy.
   On Tuesday, Suez and its allies said they had started
negotiations with a group of shareholders led by de Benedetti with
the aim to ``permit the efficient management and development'' of
Societe Generale.
   In a joint statement issued after a shareholder meeting on
Tuesday, the two groups said that any final agreement, if forged,
would be announced Friday.
   De Benedetti and his allies control more than 40 percent of
Societe Generale. Suez, the Belgian insurer Groupe AG and their
allies hold a slim majority.
   Despite their apparent willingness to hold talks, the two groups
still appear to be at odds over who will manage the company. The
statement said that Suez, Groupe AG and their allies will vote in
favor of the nomination of Herve de Carmoy, a French banker, to
Societe Generale's board, while De Benedetti and his allies will
abstain.
   It is expected that De Carmoy will be asked to take over a large
part of Societe Generale's management.
   De Benedetti's group said in the statement that it will respond
to the appointment of a managing director ``at the proper time.''
   Societe Generale Governor Rene Lamy Tuesday predicted a ``solid
recovery'' in the company's 1988 net income. He further forecast
that Societe Generale's current earnings should double in the
period between 1987 and 1990.
   Societe Generale's net profit fell 43 percent in 1987 to 3.61
billion francs, or $100 million, from 6.33 billion francs, or $176
million the previous year.

   Stock prices opened higher this morning, partly
recovering from losses of the previous session that traders had
blamed on anxiety over inflation and rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 8.89 points
to 2,092.82 as of 10 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.47 to 152.43. The
American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.28 to 305.40.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 2-to-1 on the NYSE,
with 624 up, 310 down and 463 unchanged. Volume totaled 20.78
million shares after the first half hour.
   Stocks appeared to benefit somewhat from a lower-than-expected
rise of 0.3 percent in May consumer prices reported by the Labor
Department this morning. There was no evidence that a prolonged
Midwest drought and other inflation signals worrying the financial
markets played a role in the May increase, which translates into an
annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 20.09 to
2,083.93. Losing issues outnumbered gains by about 3-to-2 on in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 883 down, 588 up and
485 unchanged.
   NYSE volume totaled 116.75 million shares, the slowest since a
1988 record low of 102.64 million shares traded May 23. It also was
about one-third the volume of the year's record high of 343.92
million shares traded Friday, when dividend-capture strategies and
expiring contracts on futures and options grossly inflated the
volume figure.

<HEAD>Drought Has Yet to be Felt in Retail Stores</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices climbed a modest 0.3 percent
in May, the government said today, easing fears of inflation and
indicating that the drought plaguing the Farm Belt has yet to reach
grocery store shelves.
   The May increase, less than the gains of 0.5 percent in March
and 0.4 percent in April, would amount to an annual inflation rate
of 4.2 percent if prices climbed at the same pace for 12 months,
the Labor Department said.
   Food prices prices rose just 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.6
percent increase in April. Analysts said the only area where the
effects of the drought showed up were in higher retail prices for
vegetable oil and mayonnaise.
   The biggest price increase was for gasoline, up 1.7 percent
after a 1.1 percent increase in April. Gasoline prices, however,
are still just 2.9 percent higher than they were a year ago.
   Automobile prices rose 0.2 percent last month with the paring of
many dealer incentives.
   Stock prices opened higher today on the New York Stock Exchange
an hour after the inflation report was issued. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks fell more than 20 points in slow
trading Monday as analysts had anticipated a larger increase in the
Consumer Price Index.
   ``It was pretty low compared to expectations,'' John Hagens, an
analyst for the Wefa Group, an economic consulting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., said of the price report. ``The food picture hasn't
really passed into the CPI yet.''
   For the first five months of 1988, overall retail prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.4 percent, the same pace they grew in
1987, the government said.
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III said last week that the
Reagan administration remains optimistic that its targeted
inflation cap of 4.5 percent for 1988 will not be exceeded.
   However, low unemployment-spurred wage gains that have been
outpacing price increases over the last three months plus
anticipated future food price hikes from the current drought in the
Farm Belt have triggered fears of a inflationary wage-price spiral
later this year or in early 1989.
   Leading the food price increases were gains for meats, poultry,
fish and eggs, up 0.8 percent last month compared with a 1.4
percent rise in April. Price increases for fruits and vegetables
also slowed from their 1.4 percent rise in April to 0.6 percent in
May.
   The increases for other food and beverages were one-half of 1
percent or less.
   ``The drought and major hikes in commodity prices that we're
seeing are scary, but it's just too soon for them to have reached
the retail market,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist for the
Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
   Donald Ratajczak, an economist who directs his own survey of
wholesale and retail prices from Georgia State University in
Atlanta, said poultry was a key ingredient in higher consumer food
prices last month.
   ``The poultry producers may be responding to higher feed costs,
but they are the result more of large U.S. soy meal sales to the
Soviet Union last fall than the drought,'' he said.
   About the only place where the 1988 drought could have reached
the retail level so far, Ratajczak said, is in the prices of
vegetable oil and mayonnaise. Those prices rose 0.8 percent in May,
but account for only one-fourth of 1 percent of the consumer price
index.
   Medical costs jumped 0.7 percent in May and are now 6.4 percent
higher than they were a year ago, making them the single biggest
propellant of inflation in the Consumer Price Index.
   But prices for women's clothing, which had skyrocketed a total
of 7 percent in March and April, fell by 0.4 percent last month.
   ``Apparel prices have softened and the large increases there are
over,'' said Ms. Shaber. `There's a lot of stiff consumer
resistance out there. Retailers already have put the stuff on
sale.''
   The 0.3 percent increase in the overall index in May was the
smallest since a 0.2 percent rise in February.
   The May figures raised the index to 117.5, meaning that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84 base
period would have cost $117.50 last month, a dime more than in
April.
   While severe inflation has yet to rear its head, analysts expect
a combination of drought-related commodity shortages and decade-low
unemployment to push prices up faster in 1989.
   Hourly wage increases, for example, have outpaced price
inflation the last two months after lagging way behind for more
than a year.
   To some, like Ms. Shaber, the wage increases can only be
expected at some point to catch up with price inflation. But to
other analysts, particularly those with close ties to the financial
markets, the prospect is scary.
   ``We're definitely getting an acceleration of inflation and the
beginning of a wage response to that,'' said Allen Sinai, an
economist for the Boston Co., and New York consulting house. ``I
think we're in the incipient stages of a wage-price spiral.''
   Ratajczak said higher feed costs resulting from the drought will
prompt ranchers to send more cattle to slaughter, putting an
initial downward rather than upward pressure on food prices.
   ``However, the reduced meat supplies then will increase food
inflation in 1989,'' he said. ``And higher food inflation may
intensify wage demands, leading to modest acceleration in 1989.''
   That modest acceleration is defined by Ratajczak as 5.5 percent
inflation next year.

   Stocks rose this morning on news of
lower-than-expected consumer price increases, helping the market
partly recover from losses of the previous session that traders had
blamed on inflation anxiety.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 9.78 points
to 2,093.71 as of 11 a.m. EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.44 to 152.40. The
American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.60 to 305.72.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 3-to-2 on the NYSE,
with 663 up, 465 down and 527 unchanged. Volume totaled 43.38
million shares after the first 90 minutes.
   Stocks appeared to benefit somewhat from a mild rise of 0.3
percent in May consumer prices reported by the Labor Department
this morning.
   There was no evidence that a prolonged Midwest drought and other
inflation signals worrying the financial markets played a role in
the May increase, which translates into an annual inflation rate of
4.2 percent.
   ``I think this figure was better than expected, which gave the
market a little lift,'' said Hank Streifler, senior vice president
on the trading floor at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Texaco led the NYSE's most-active list, down \ to 46| on volume
exceeding 1 million shares. Takeover strategist Carl Icahn conceded
defeat Monday in a shareholder proxy battle with management of the
oil company.

   Rain brought scant relief to some farmers in the parched Upper
Midwest today with thermometers expected to triple digits again,
and a meteorologist said a hurricane might be needed to end the
drought in the Southeast.
   On the dwindling Mississippi River, a major bottleneck near
Rosedale, Miss., was reopened when barges were freed from a
narrowed channel, but the Coast Guard planned to close the river
for up to three days just north of Memphis beginning tonight to
dredge a shallow section.
   In Dayton, Ohio, a ``hay hotline'' was starting today for
farmers seeking fodder from as far west as Kansas to feed their
cattle in the face of the grass-wilting drought. A similar hotline
went into effect Monday for Iowa farmers.
   A Monday evening storm in northern Illinois brought the first
significant moisture to that area in 28 days, depositing up to a
half-inch of rain. Light rain also fell in Michigan and Indiana.
   ``Any bit of rain will help, but it's not a cure-all,'' said
Rich Brumer, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Illinois.
``We need to have something like this every three days for the next
month before we can say the drought is ended.''
   Thunderstorms moving through northwestern Minnesota and eastern
North Dakota dumped as much as 1.7 inches of rain in spots early
today, but another day of record heat would evaporate some of that
moisture. Wind up to 50 mph cut power to some 10,000 customers in
Brainerd, Minn.
   Weather service meteorologist Lou Ramey told Ohio's drought task
force at its first meeting that the state is moving into its driest
months and there is little hope for heavy, widespread rain soon.
   More than three dozen record-high temperatures were reported
Monday, mostly across the dry Midwest, and more of the same was
predicted for today.
   A meteorologist said Monday a hurricane might be just the trick
to snap the dry spell in the Southeast.
   ``Of course, we don't want to see any hurricanes,'' said Paul
Pettit, a weather service forecaster in Montgomery, Ala. ``But the
hurricane and the tropical activity may be the answer to the
long-term lack of rainfall and water replenishment that we're
probably going to need.''
   Mississippi River barges freed last weekend from sandbar tie-ups
to the north and south of Memphis, Tenn., again faced an obstacle,
the Coast Guard said Monday.
   A 1,000-foot-long section of the Mississippi six miles north of
Memphis has shrunk from 500 feet wide and 15 feet deep to 170 feet
wide and nine feet deep due to the drought, said Cmdr. Michael
Donohoe of Coast Guard headquarters in Memphis.
   ``Undoubtedly there will be a backlog here. We could probably
have between 800 and 1,200 barges arriving at Memphis over the next
24 to 48 hours,'' he said Monday.
   A dredge was scheduled to arrive today to begin scooping out the
low spot. Donohoe said the river likely would be closed during the
dredging, which could take two days or more.
   The freeing of a 26-barge tow near Rosedale and Gunnison, Miss.,
completely reopened the 730 miles of the Mississippi downstream
from Memphis to the Gulf of Mexico, the Corps of Engineers said
today.
   ``Once they got the grounded tow cleared out there was a
nine-foot channel,'' said Bob Anderson, a Corps of Engineers
spokesman in Memphis. ``But the channel is not very wide, and
there's a pretty wicked Z-style dog-leg, so traffic is moving very
gingerly right now.''
   The record-low water also is creating huge sandbars that are
drawing spectators dangerously close to the swirling Mississippi.
Three people drowned Sunday near Natchez, Miss., when a sandbar
they were walking on fell apart, officials said.
   Low water and the heat also are being blamed for an extensive
fish kill on the Platte River, a Nebraska Game and Parks official
said.
   With no end in sight for the farm-belt drought, grain and
soybean futures prices spurted sharply higher Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Except for winter wheat, which is already being harvested, all
grain and soybean futures on the market shot up by their daily
allowable limits at the opening bell and didn't budge all day.
   Wheat futures are at their highest level in nearly seven years.
Corn futures are at four-year highs.
   The Montana Agricultural Statistics Service reported Monday that
71 percent of Montana's spring wheat crop is in ``poor'' or ``very
poor'' condition, compared with 62 percent a week ago.
   In Texas, state Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower described
the situation as an emergency.
   In New Orleans, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng
warned that the withering crops could mean disaster for farmers and
spiraling costs for consumers.
   Lyng said the worst threat is in the Mideast's Corn Belt, but
problems are looming for Southern soybean growers.
   ``Corn is the most important crop in the United States. Soybeans
is second,'' Lyng said. ``If those are lost, who can say what it
will mean; it's never happened before.''

   Futures prices of corn and soybeans opened
sharply higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with corn
futures soaring the limit for daily trading for the sixth
consecutive session.
   Wheat futures retreated on profit-taking as the winter wheat
harvest advanced.
   The drought in the Farm Belt showed no sign of easing and
futures traders continued to bet on lower corn and soybean yields.
   ``The real damage is being done in corn,'' said Richard Loewy,
senior grain and oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``I'm looking at at least a 10-to-13 bushels-per-acre decline''
in corn yields, or about a 12 percent drop from last year, Loewy
said.
   Skyrocketing soybean prices triggered an increase in the Board
of Trade's daily price limit on soybean futures from 30 cents to 45
cents a bushel for three days beginning today. Limits on corn
futures dropped back to 10 cents a bushel today after three days at
15 cents.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly crop progress report issued
Monday found most of the U.S. corn crop in fair condition and most
soybeans in fair to good shape as of Sunday. The survey found the
winter wheat harvest more than 20 percent complete.
   In early trading, wheat was 3{ cents to 5{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.97 a bushel; corn was 10 cents
higher across the board with July at $3.34{ a bushel; oats were 5
cents to 10 cents higher with March at $2.96 a bushel; soybeans
were 10{ cents to 45 cents higher with July at $10.46{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher and pork futures were sharply higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with August at
64.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to 1 cent higher
with August at 70.70 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to 1.50
cents higher with July at 46.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.18 cents to 2 cents higher with July at 43.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed mixed on Monday.

<HEAD>Honda Brings Unprecedented Economic Boom To Ohio Counties</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH GRACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some days, Jack Scott is sure he's
dreaming.
   Scott, who heads the Chamber of Commerce in this central Ohio
city of 8,500, is overseeing what has become a Rust Belt rarity _
unprecedented economic growth bringing new people and money to his
hometown and other communities in central and west central Ohio.
   The catalyst for the change is Honda of America Manufacturing
Inc., the nation's fourth-largest automaker, which opened a tiny
motorcycle plant here in 1980 and now employs thousands of
white-suited workers at auto and motorcycle plants here and at an
engine plant in Anna, about 50 miles to the west.
   The fortunes of Honda _ and the suppliers that have nestled
around it _ have created a boom in Marysville, surrounding Union
County and 13 other Ohio counties. The growth has sent officials
scrambling for more land and more housing.
   The ``Honda corridor'' is one of the biggest growth areas in the
state, say development experts.
   ``I wouldn't discount (growth in) northeast Ohio, Toledo or
Cincinnati as far as business development,'' said Catherine
Ferrari, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Development.
``But it would be safe to say that this is one of them. It's all
small businesses. Honda is a boost to that area, but it's the
smaller businesses opening around it that is helping in the
growth.''
   The figures speak for themselves.
   From an initial work force of 17 in 1979, Honda of America has
grown to a company with 5,900 workers _ the company calls them
associates _ at three plants. Another auto assembly plant is to be
built in nearby East Liberty, and the existing Anna engine plant is
to be expanded.
   There is no sign the business boom is going to go bust any time
soon.
   Honda, which has invested $870 million in Ohio to date and
produces 1,500 cars a day, expects by 1991 to have invested $1.7
billion and employ 8,650 workers, said company spokesman Roger
Lambert. The company also plans to increase the percentage of parts
it purchases from American producers from 60 percent to 75 percent
by 1991.
   In all, the investment has paid off for residents and suppliers
in 14 Ohio counties and 24 other states, Lambert said.
   Marysville, about 20 miles northwest of Columbus in Union
County, and Bellefontaine, about 25 miles west of Marysville in
Logan County, are the two main benefactors.
   Folks contend that the new flow of money in the area has not
changed those who live there.
   ``There's still not a whole lot to do around here,'' Scott said.
``People still work and go home and watch TV. We like it.''
   But while the residents may not have changed, circumstances have.
   Both cities, in addition to increases in traffic, vandalism and
drug trafficking, are rapidly running out of housing and new land
upon which to build.
   In Marysville alone, 250 housing starts are expected this year.
A new school building, YMCA, library and shopping center are
planned, under construction or ready to open. An $18 million
regional shopping mall complex, multifamily homes, a warehouse and
offices to serve the Marysville, Bellefontaine, Urbana and Kent
areas are to be built on U.S. 33 just east of Bellefontaine. That
project is expected to create up to 900 jobs.
   At least one new 18-hole course inside Marysville city limits is
under construction, and plans for a golf village in Bellefontaine
are in the works.
   The need for golf courses grew with the arrival of the Japanese,
Scott said.
   ``They love golf. They play and they play. They love it here
because it's so expensive to play in Japan. It's a real luxury
there,'' he said.
   But not everyone is happy about Honda's presence _ or the lack
of it.
   Traffic jams, which never existed in the area before, are
becoming commonplace. Smaller employers say they are also feeling
some pain from high turnover rates and have had to increase
salaries to avoid losing personnel to Honda and other companies
that pay more.
   There also are pockets of anti-Japanese sentiment lingering from
World War II.
   William V. Leitz resigned in April as mayor of Wapakoneta, an
Auglaize County community about 12 miles north of Honda's Anna
plant. He said he could not, in good conscience, deal with the
Japanese.
   ``I was on a destroyer (in the South Pacific) that was sunk ...
and I was in the hospital. I don't care if it would have been the
Germans. I would have felt the same way. I'm an American, and I
love my country.''
   The 64-year-old, 13-year mayor said he would rather quit than
hurt the city's development efforts.
   In Lima, about 20 miles to the north in Allen County, Mayor Gene
Joseph is angry that Honda and other Japanese companies moving into
Ohio have focused much of their activity outside larger cities.
   Joseph stirred controversy and calls for his resignation in
early May when he claimed Japanese companies do not want to locate
in communities with sizable black populations and strong union
traditions.
   Marysville's black population is virtually non-existent, admits
Scott.
   ``Unions have never been here. People just don't think that way.
That's why the UAW can't get a foot in here,'' he said. The United
Auto Workers attempted to organize workers at Honda, but withdrew
its request for an election in late 1985.
   Scott acknowledges anti-Honda sentiment exists, but believes it
is a fact of life in a growing city.
   ``Sure people (complain) a little bit, but most of them are on
their way to the bank,'' he said.
   Communities benefiting from Honda also are enjoying incentives
promised to Honda by the state.
   Natalie Wymer, a spokeswoman for the state Development
Department, said state grants for training and other incentives,
such as road construction, total at least $59 million since 1977.
Another $4.7 million has gone to suppliers that have since
surrounded Honda's operations. She said the Honda incentive package
is among the largest the state has ever offered.
   The state has sunk at least $25.15 million and the federal
government, $65.4 million into the rehabilitation and widening of
U.S. 33, the main road through Union and Logan counties. Honda
itself is contributing another $30 million. Overall, an estimated
$136.55 million has gone toward road renovation in the two counties
since Honda opened its doors, according to state transportation
officials.
   The company has also spent millions for parts and supplies in
the area and paid Union County $5 million last year in real estate
and personal property taxes. The largest benefactor of that payment
was the Marysville school system, which received $3.5 million, he
said.

<HEAD>Cyprus Builds Up Shipping Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cyprus, which has the world's seventh
largest shipping fleet, is quickly building a reputation as an
international maritime center.
   The east Mediterranean island, which has been the center of
trade routes between the West and the Middle East for centuries,
boasts the fastest growing shipping register in the world.
   ``Our objective is to attract shipping-banks, marine insurers,
lawyers and brokers through tax incentives and other facilities,''
said Zenon Katsourides, recently appointed special shipping
consultant to President George Vassiliou.
   The shipping register has grown from 1,487 ships and a gross
tonnage of 9.6 million at the end of 1985, to 2,000 ships and a
tonnage of 17 million now, Katsourides said.
   ``We want to be able to offer all the services peripheral to
shipping by building on our existing base,'' he told The Associated
Press in an interview.
   The Cypriots recently announced plans to open offices in New
York and Hong Kong to develop new markets for its shipping register.
   Parliament is discussing updating all shipping legislation
passed in the last 30 years, and the government is expanding
facilities at Larnaca, a port on the south coast and the second
largest on the island. It will eventually be able to handle 60,000
containers a day.
   Larnaca and the other major port of Limassol, 35 miles to the
west, lie in the Greek Cypriot sector of the war-divided island.
   The major port of Famagusta was overrun by the Turkish Army,
which invaded in July 1974. The Turks seized the northern one-third
of the island, which is now a breakway republic.
   Katsourides, 48, a self-made millionaire who retired from ship
management in London 10 years ago to return to his native island,
bristles at charges that Cyprus is a flag of convenience.
   ``To start with, 22 percent of the Cyprus registry tonnage is
Cypriot-owned, so we're a truly national flag,'' he said.
   The rest of the tonnage is owned by Greek and West German
interests, each with 35 percent, with the remaining 8 percent
belonging to other nations, Katsourides said.
   He added that the main attraction of the Cypriot registry is
that Cyprus shipping law is based on English maritime legislation
``and is consequently accepted both by banks and insurance
companies.''
   In addition, this legislation ``is being constantly upgraded to
safeguard the interests of both the owners and the seafarers,'' he
said.
   Cyprus was recently elected to the board of the International
Maritime Organization, and has ratified all international maritime
conventions and agreements between owners and seamen's unions, he
said.
   The London-based ``Lloyd's List,'' a shipping industry
newspaper, said Katsourides' appointment was ``seen as a signal to
the shipping community around the world that changes to the Cyprus
maritime administration will be given priority.''
   Katsourides' first moves after his appointment ``showed he is
living up to his reputation, won in the banking and offshore
sectors, as being energetic and enthusiastic,'' the daily added.
   Katsourides said Cyprus has already established itself as an
important offshore banking and business center.
   ``Our intention to offer all the services peripheral to shipping
will not only prove beneficial for owners, but it will also benefit
Cyprus, he said.
   ``It has a large number of professionally qualified people,
including lawyers, accountants and engineers, familiar with
shipping.''
   He said the large potential for future development in Cyprus
lies in shore-based, shipping-related activities.
   A significant number of shipping and ship-management companies
are operating on the island, while marine insurance companies and
other agencies have established local offices.
   One of the Cyprus-based ship-management companies is the West
German-controlled Columbia Ship Management Ltd. Chairman Heinrich
Schoeller said his company employs 3,750 people, 250 ashore and
3,500 on 125 ships at sea, 56 of which fly the Cyprus flag.
   ``We're satisfied with the facilities offered in Cyprus and the
advantages of the Cyprus flag, and plan to use Cyprus as our
headquarters for many years to come,'' he said.
   Government revenues from shipping currently run to about 2
million Cyprus pounds ($4 million), Katsourides said.

   The stock market advanced this morning on news
of lower-than-expected consumer price increases, easing anxiety
over inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 10.66 points
to 2,094.59 as of noon EDT on Wall Street.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.44 to 152.40. The
American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.82 to 305.94.
   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about a 7-to-5 ratio on the
NYSE, with 719 up, 502 down and 550 unchanged. Volume totaled 65.58
million shares in the morning, vs. 54.74 million shares Monday
morning.
   Brokers said stocks benefited somewhat from a relatively mild
rise of 0.3 percent in May consumer prices reported by the Labor
Department this morning.
   There was no evidence that a prolonged Midwest drought and other
inflation signals worrying the financial markets played a role in
the May increase, which translates into an annual inflation rate of
4.2 percent.
   ``I think this figure was better than expected, which gave the
market a little lift,'' said Hank Streifler, senior vice president
on the trading floor at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Texaco led the NYSE's most-active list, up \ to 47[ on volume
exceeding 1 million shares. Carl Icahn conceded defeat Monday in a
shareholder proxy battle with management of the oil company, but
the takeover strategist's next move remains unclear.
   IBM rose 1\ to 118]. The company unveiled a new group of
computers.
   Murray Ohio fell 2| to 55[. The company said it will be acquired
in a $56-a-share deal with Britain's Tomkins PLC, topping a hostile
$52-a-share offer from AB Electrolux of Sweden.
   Airline stocks were widely higher, reflecting a fare increase
for business travelers. UAL rose 1{ to 87\, NWA rose ] to 43{ and
AMR rose \ to 46|.

   The government in the last few days has won
the cooperation in its Pentagon bribery probe of someone whose
voice turned up frequently on court-ordered wiretaps, a source
familiar with the matter said today.
   A second target of the probe appears on the verge of
cooperating, said the source, who demanded anonymity.
   It could not be determined whether the target who is cooperating
is a Pentagon employee, a consultant or a defense contractor.
   Sources familiar with the probe also said that one wiretap
involves a conversation between former Navy Secretary John Lehman
Jr. and his then-aide Melvyn Paisley.
   The sources said that conversation, recorded late last year or
early this year, can be interpreted as being a tip-off by Lehman
that Paisley might be under investigation.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III refused to say Monday whether
Lehman is among those under scrutiny. Paisley and another former
Lehman aide, retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons, have been
implicated.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to
describe the possible warning, which investigators are examining as
a potential obstruction of justice and which occurred after both
Lehman and Paisley had left the government.
   The government frequently relies on gaining the cooperation of
participants in a white-collar conspiracy to win the conviction of
bigger targets.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has issued a
directive specifying that any Pentagon employee under scrutiny in
the bribery probe must be reassigned to a new job, said spokesman
Dan Howard.
   Confirming earlier reports from Pentagon sources, Howard said
Carlucci had directed that anyone who became ``the subject of the
investigation'' must be given ``duties that will not involve them
in on-going procurements or provide them access to information
related to on-going procurements.''
   While no individual has been charged yet, ``Secretary Carlucci
took this action in the interest or ensuring that the on-going
procurements of the department are free from question,'' Howard
added.
   The spokesman repeatedly declined to say how many Pentagon
workers had been affected by Carlucci's directive, referring all
such queries to the Justice Department.
   Pentagon sources, demanding anonymity, later disclosed the
directive had so far led to reassignments for six employees _ five
identified last week in search warrants, plus a sixth, unidentified
employee whose office was not searched but who is also under
investigation.
   Efforts to learn the sixth employee's identity and job were not
immediately successful. The other five are:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _James Gaines, the deputy assistant Navy secretary for
acquisition management.
   _Dr. Victor Cohen, the deputy assistant Air Force secretary in
charge of buying tactical command, control, communications and
computer systems. His office was searched last week.
   _George Stone, a Navy official in the Space and Naval Warfare
Systems Command.
   _Stuart Berlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command.
   _Marine Corps official Jack Sherman, who works in the equipment
and service acquisition section of the contracts division,
installation and logistics department.
   The move by Carlucci followed a high-level meeting on Monday at
which Pentagon officials reportedly studied what actions they could
take in the case.
   Carlucci may also consider whether to suspend contracts with the
companies involved in the probe, including some of the biggest
military suppliers in the country. The companies' offices were
searched last week in pursuit of illicitly obtained inside
contracting information.
   Suspension of contracts could be disruptive to the military,
ruinous for contractors who live or die on government business, and
damaging to their employees.
   One source said he doubted so dramatic a step would be taken at
this point because the Defense Department itself lacks information
about the dimensions of the affair.
   ``I don't think the FBI is sharing much with us yet,'' he said.
   The New York Times reported today that three additional defense
contractors _ Hercules Inc., Gould Inc. and Electronic Data Systems
Corp., a General Motors Corp. subsidiary _ acknowledged that they
had been subpoenaed in the probe.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Rep. Bill Chappell, chairman of the
House Appropriations defense subcommittee, denied that he or any
other member of Congress is under investigation.
   ``There's is no member of Congress, to my knowledge, who is a
target of this investigation _ and I'm a member of Congress,'' the
Florida Democrat told reporters. ``If there's anyone that's
involved in the kind of activities alleged, he should be brought
swiftly to justice.''
   CBS News reported Monday night that three congressmen _ Reps.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.; Andrew Ireland, R-Fla., and Sam Stratton,
D-N.Y. _ were under scrutiny in the case, but that there was not
yet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation. CBS
said it got its information from law enforcement sources whom it
did not identify.
   Spokesmen for Downey and Ireland said no government official had
contacted either congressmen or their offices in connection with
the probe. Downey blasted as ``wholly incorrect'' a newspaper
article linking him with the investigation. CBS said Stratton's
office also said it had not been contacted.
   The U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Henry
Hudson, who is coordinating the investigation, held out the
possibility that more information about the scope of the affair may
come this week when more of the 38 search warrants issued a week
ago are unsealed and made public.
   One search warrant that has already been made public said the
investigation centers on leaks of confidential information _
``provided by government employees receiving bribes or gratuities''
_ about contracting details which could enable one company to
outbid another.
   Hudson said 270 subpoenas have been issued so far and more
search warrants may be served.
   The affair came to light June 14 when federal investigators
seized materials from defense contractors, military consultants and
Defense Department officials.
   Meese called his news conference to respond to a senator's
assertion that the Justice Department had squelched testimony about
procurement corruption three years ago.
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., in a Senate speech, said a
Defense Department investigator about to testify on his findings
concerning procurement corruption was kept from doing so by a top
Justice Department official who grabbed the microphone away from
him.
   ``I stopped the hearing at that point,'' Grassley said. ``I wish
now I hadn't. There wasn't anything in that testimony that could
have jeopardized that case.''
   Meese, at his own news conference after Grassley's comments,
said, ``I can assure you that at no time has this department had to
be dragged into any indictment where the evidence is there.''
   The attorney general said that since 1985, the defense
procurement fraud unit has obtained 35 convictions and recovered
some $32 million.

   Share prices jumped on Tuesday to finish near the
session's highest levels, but analysts had trouble explaining the
rise.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 16.1
points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,860.1, at the close, fractionally
below its best level for the day of 1,860.2.
   Trading volume amounted to 380.2 million shares, slightly better
than Monday's 323.6 million shares.
   ``It seems to me as if the market is simply showing that it
wants to move higher at this point,'' said one analyst.
   The market has been able to ``resist bad news and refuses to go
down very far,'' said Charles Larkham, an equity analyst with James
Capel & Co.
   ``It's very encouraging that London is moving higher without the
stimulus coming from either New York or Tokyo,'' he said.

   Tomkins PLC, a British industrial holding company,
said Tuesday it has agreed to acquire Tennessee-based Murray Ohio
Manufacturing Co., the target of a hostile bid from AB Electrolux
of Sweden, for $224 million.
   Tomkins will pay $56 dollars a share for the U.S. maker of
lawnmowers and bicycles, topping a $52-a-share bid from Electrolux
that Murray Ohio's board rejected as inadequate.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for AB Electrolux said that in view of
the merger announcement, it is terminating its tender offer for
Murray Ohio.
   ``We thought our all-cash offer of $52 per share was fully
priced, and we are not willing to pay a higher price,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``Murray Ohio is a typical Tomkins acquisition ... with strong
brands in stable markets,'' said Tomkins Chief Executive Gregory
Hutchings.
   He also pointed to Murray Ohio's ``unrealized potential'' and
said the acquisition should ``produce enhanced growth in earnings
per share for Tomkins.''
   Tomkins, which changed its name from F.H. Tomkins PLC earlier
this year, already has interests in the lawnmower business in
Britain through its Hayters PLC and Beaver Equipment Ltd. units.
   The acquisition of Murray Ohio would be Tomkins' second purchase
in the United States after its $112.5 million acquisition of Smith
& Wesson Corp., the U.S. gun manufacturer, from Lear Siegler
Holdings Corp. a year ago.

   Dow U.S.A. and Exxon Chemical Co. said
Tuesday they have formed a joint venture to manufacture material
for adhesives and sealants.
   The group will build a $20 million plant in Plaquemine, La.,
where Dow has a manufacturing facility.
   The companies will share equally in the capital investment and
expenses of building the plant and in profits from marketing the
styrenic thermoplastic elastomers it will produce, said L. Dennis
McKeever, Dow vice president for polyolefins and elastomers.
   McKeever said some current Dow employees at Plaquemine will be
involved in operating the plant, but it has not been determined how
many new jobs will be created.
   Applications for the materials include pressure-sensitive
adhesive tapes and hot-melt adhesives, said McKeever, who made the
announcement jointly with Jean Pierre L'Hermitte, Exxon Chemical
vice president for adhesion products.
   Potential future uses include the manufacture of roofing and
road construction materials, elastomeric rubber for footwear and
other specialty applications, McKeever said.
   The plant, scheduled to begin production in 1990, would make 70
million pounds a year of the styrenic TPEs, about 10 percent of
worldwide production. The Dow-Exxon venture would be the
second-largest producer after Shell Chemical Co., McKeever said.

<HEAD>Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank
Tuesday announced an increase in a key interest rate, sparking
criticism that the move could worsen unemployment.
   The securities repurchase rate, known as the ``repo rate,'' was
increased from 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent.
   A daily West German newspaper had reported last week that the
Bundesbank decided to increase the rate, which it pays to trade
securities in the open market. The rate had been unchanged since
November.
   Analysts said the central bank's move didn't constitute a sharp
policy reversal. They said it was a reaction to several new
economic trends, such as better global economic growth prospects,
rising inflation, and the strong dollar.
   ``It was an adjustment to a changed environment,'' said Hermann
Remsperger, chief economist at the Berliner Handels and Frankfurter
Bank.
   ``The (3.25 percent) rate was created at a time when the world
looked very differently from what it looks today,'' he said.
   But an increase in borrowing costs can often lead to slower
economic growth, some observers said. A leading member of West
Germany's Employees' Union said the decision ``endangers economic
growth and expansion of employment opportunities'' when joblessness
is already about 8.4 percent.
   ``Since the government up to now has failed in developing a
program for fighting unemployment, the responsibility for low
economic growth must be tied to the monetary polities of the
central bank,'' said Employees Union board member Ursula Konitzer.
   In a news release, the Alliance of West German Labor Unions
(DGB) also blasted the rate increase, saying the Bundesbank was
using the higher dollar as an excuse to hike interest rates.
   ``Using this as justification to stop the danger of inflation is
not convincing, because current price increases have been 1 percent
for months,'' the DGB statement said.
   The dollar was hardly affected by the news, remaining steady
just below 1.7600 Deutsche marks, and West German bond prices
firmed during Tuesday morning.
   It isn't clear yet whether the rate hike was a one-time move or
the beginning of a string of interest rate hikes, said Remsperger.
``It will depend on the market reaction,'' he said.
   But Ute Geipel, chief economist at Citibank AG, Citicorp's
Frankfurt subsidiary, said a further interest rate hike is only
likely if the U.S. Federal Reserve pushes up its own rates.

<TEXT>
   McKesson Corp. announced Tuesday it will
expand its wholesale drug distribution business by acquiring Alco
Health Services for $500 million.
   McKesson has agreed to purchase Alco, a drug and health care
products distributor based in Valley Forge, Penn., for $30 a share
in cash. A tender offer is set to begin June 27.
   ``The acquisition of Alco Health Services reflects our strategy
of focusing our resources on the distribution of prescription
drugs, health and beauty aids and general merchandise to drug
stores, supermarkets and mass merchandizers,'' said Thomas W. Field
Jr., president and chief executive officer of San Francisco-based
McKesson Corp.
   The company's businesses include McKesson Drug Co., one of the
largest wholesale drug distributors in the nation; Armor All
Products, automotive appearance products; and the McKesson Water
Division, bottlers of Alhambra Water in Northern California and
Sparkletts Water in Southern California.
   With the acquisition of Alco, McKesson's wholesale drug business
will total 80 percent of overall sales, said company spokesman
Marvin L. Krasnansky.
   ``McKesson used to be a conglomerate, but now we are focusing on
what we know best,'' he said.
   Alco Standard Corp. owns 50 percent of Alco Health Services' 13
million outstanding shares. Under the agreement, McKesson, which at
present owns no Alco stock, will purchase Alco Standard's shares
for $30 a piece following the tender offer to the public
shareholders, Krasnansky said.
   McKesson had $7.3 billion in revenues and net income of $95
million during the fiscal year ended March 31, Krasnansky said.
   Alco's revenues totaled $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ending
Dec. 30. Net income totaled $18 million, he said.

   Stocks bounced around in a directionless pattern
today, buffeted by conflicting economic signals and futures-linked
computerized trading strategies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks seesawed in a
narrow range, largely mirroring movements in the bond market. By 3
p.m. EDT the indicator was up 12.26 points to 2,096.19.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.56 to 152.52. On the

   Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 4-to-3 on the NYSE,
with 808 up, 601 down and 496 unchanged. Volume totaled 126.38
million shares with an hour of trading left.
   Brokers said stocks and bonds benefited somewhat in the morning
from a relatively mild rise of 0.3 percent in May consumer prices
reported by the Labor Department.
   But a selloff by inflation-sensitive bondholders, worried about
credit-tightening moves by the Federal Reserve, spilled over into
Wall Street and depressed prices by early afternoon.
   ``The market's been up and down,'' said Thomas Ianiro, partner
on the trading desk at William Blair & Co. in Chicago. ``We had a
pretty good report on the morning consumer-price figures. But I
believe the bond market gave us a false impression, then turned
around and slam-dunked us.''
   By late afternoon stocks were moving higher again as bonds
recovered. There also was a spate of demand triggered by
computerized trading programs that profit from price differences
between stock-index futures and stocks.
   Texaco led the NYSE's most-active list, up 1 to 47~ on volume

<TEXT>
   Government leaders Tuesday moved to shore up
Japanese farming after acceding to American demands to lower
barriers on imported beef and oranges.
   Key Cabinet ministers and officials in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party emerged from a hastily called meeting Tuesday
morning with a broad outline of steps to ease the transition for
the nation's farmers.
   They included trimming production costs, subsidizing farmers,
buying up farmland and encouraging tangerine growers to convert
their plots to other uses, according to a statement released by the
government.
   The measures were announced one day after Agriculture Minister
Takashi Sato and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter signed
an agreement that could double the imports of American beef and
oranges by 1991 to $1 billion a year.
   The agreement came after months of negotiations and complaints
by the United States against Japan's restrictive import quotas.
   Also Tuesday, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries announced Sato would head for Australia on Wednesday to
work out a new beef import pact with officials in Canberra.
Australia provides about 60 percent of Japan's beef imports, while
American beef accounts for about a third.
   The government statement called for ``drastic measures'' to
stabilize the price of Japanese beef calves, said to cost about 10
times as much as their American equivalents. Many Japanese beef
producers rely on calves sold by breeders.
   The news release also called for developing new markets to boost
demand for Japanese citrus but gave no details on any of the
proposals.
   While American cattlemen and citrus growers welcomed the new
accord, Japan Agriculture Ministry officials said they were still
trying to assess the effect Monday's agreement would have on
Japan's farmers. The Asahi Evening News said the price of Japanese
beef could plunge to half the current level, but gave no time frame
and quoted no sources.
   One hundred grams, or about 3.5 ounces of Japanese bee,f now
sells for about 450 yen, or $3.56 _ double the local price for
American beef.
   An official at a major trading house said the trade pact, which
calls for Japan to nearly double its imports of beef in three years
and erase its quotas on imported oranges after two years, was
already worrying fishermen, suppliers of a chief protein source
that is still cheaper than home-grown beef.
   ``This is just part of the iceberg,'' said Hiroshi Kawakubo of
Nissho Iwai's Feed and Livestock Department. ``When we see below
sea level, we see a very serious impact to the entire agricultural
system.''
   Ryokichi Morishita of Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain,
said it was ``thinkable'' that more trading firms and meat
producers would try their hand at raising beef cattle overseas,
much as automakers have done to avoid steep production costs at
home.
   Nissho Iwai's Kawakubo said a handful of corporations are
already producing beef bound for Japan in Australia, where land and
calf prices are cheaper than in Japan and the United States.

<HEAD>GM's Adam Opel Announces Job Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s West
German unit, Adam Opel AG, said Tuesday it plans to cut 5,200 jobs
by 1991 as part of a cost-saving program.
   The move comes as all of GM's European operations are under
pressure to reduce expenses and bolster the automaker's
profitability on the continent.
   Spokesman Erich Kupfer said the job cuts would be made through
attrition and would not require firings or plant shutdowns.
   But he said a decision had not yet been made on whether to close
the company's part-pressing plant in Russelsheim or an upholstery
shop in Bochum.
   The number of employees can be cut by 2,700 by 1990, while
another 2,500 can be eliminated the following year, the spokesman
said.
   GM Europe had a 1987 profit of $1.25 billion after a $343.3
million loss in 1986.
   The Opel unit has recently gotten a boost from its new Omega
model and a restyled Kadett.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Soar; Wheat Retreats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought fears drove futures prices of corn, oats
and soybeans up their limits for daily trading Tuesday while wheat
futures retreated on profit-taking.
   The National Weather Service's latest six-to-10 day forecast for
hot, dry weather in the Midwest through the end of the month
underpinned the rally and threatened further damage to the corn,
oat and soybean crops, analysts said.
   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain means
another 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. Some experts estimate anywhere
from 10 percent to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop has already
been ruined by lack of rain.
   Still, the Agriculture Department's weekly weather and crop
bulletin rated most U.S. corn in fair condition.
   Karlin said the soybean crop could hold out a little longer than
corn, but ``you're rapidly running out of this grace period before
rains are desperately needed. I think it'll be around the July 4th
weekend before yield losses occur.''
   Wheat futures dropped on profit-taking linked to the ongoing
winter wheat harvest, which is more than 20 percent complete,
according to the USDA.
   Skyrocketing soybean prices triggered an increase in the Board
of Trade's daily price limit on soybean futures from 30 cents to 45
cents a bushel for three days beginning Tuesday. Limits on corn
futures dropped back to 10 cents a bushel today after three days at
15 cents.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 13{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.89 a bushel; corn was 2} cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $3.34{ a bushel; oats were 9 cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $3.18 a bushel; soybeans were 10
cents to 45 cents higher with July at $10.46{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Witnesses Discuss Potential Buyers of Gillette</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two New York investment firms once offered to buy
large stakes in Gillette Co. to help the company fight a takeover
attempt by Coniston Partners, lawyers charged in opening arguments
in U.S. District Court.
   The investment companies were identified as Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co.
   They were named during opening arguments Monday in disctict
court where Coniston is trying to overturn last April's proxy vote
for four seats on Gillette's board. Gillette won the contest by a
52-to-48 percent margin.
   Gillette attorney Patrick F. McCartan said the investment firms
made their offers to help Gillette fight a takeover attempt by New
York-based Coniston and that the offers show Coniston is wrong in
arguing that Gillette misled shareholders by claiming there were no
buyers for the company.
   McCartan said Kohlberg Kravis proposed buying preferred stock
that could be converted into 40 percent of all shares outstanding,
and that Forstmann Little made a similar proposal.
   But Richard Ziegler, who is representing Coniston, said Gillette
lied when it told its stockholders there were no bidders for the
company during the proxy fight.
   Both sides claim the other ran an unfair campaign.
   McCartan said Gillette's financial adviser, Morgan Stanley &
Co., recommended against selling large interests in the company to
either firm.
   McCartan and Zeigler also disagreed over a chart that Gillette
ran as a newspaper advertisement two days before the proxy election.
   Coniston said the chart unfairly depicted the company's
relationship with Tito Tettamanti, a Swiss financier. Coniston said
Tettamanti is an investor but does not control Coniston investment
strategy.
   Gillette claimed Tettamanti controls companies connected with
Coniston behind the scenes and that Coniston violated federal
securities law by trying to conceal his involvement in the Gillette
takeover attempt. Coniston lawyers denied the allegations.

<TEXT>
   A settlement was reached Tuesday in a
lawsuit against the U.S. importers of Audi after the judge set
aside a jury verdict that a faulty Audi transmission caused a 1985
accident, a company spokesman said.
   The court refused to confirm the agreement, citing an order of
confidentiality. But Joe Bennett, a spokesman for Audi in Detroit,
said New York Supreme Court Justice Matthew F. Coppola agreed to a
motion by an attorney for Volkswagen of America, Audi's U.S.
importer, to set aside the jury's liability verdict.
   Bennett said the judge cited inadvertent references to
post-manufacturing design changes despite the court's ruling to the
contrary, the jury's exposure to media coverage of the trial and
reported discussion among jurors about the case before
deliberations began.
   Bennett said it was learned that jurors had been talking among
themselves since the second day of the trial.
   ``The court's concern that the defendant's rights might have
been prejudiced as a result requires that the verdict be set aside
in the interest of justice,'' Bennett said, quoting from the
judge's decision.
   On Thursday, the jury found Volkswagen of America liable for the
1985 accident in which Marie Lynette Ruston, 38, of Purdys was
injured. A 1979 Audi driven by Sally Mears of Scarsdale suddenly
accelerated, striking a car, which in turn hit Ms. Ruston's 1979
Toyota.
   Ms. Ruston suffered back injuries, underwent disc surgery and
had to give up her nursing career as a result of the accident,
according to testimony given during the liability trial.
   Ms. Mears bought the used car in 1983. It had been the subject
of two recalls but neither Ms. Mears or the previous owner had
taken it in for the repairs.
   The jury exonerated Ms. Mears and blamed the accident on a
defective transmission. It began hearing testimony Friday to
determine what damages Ms. Ruston should receive.
   Ms. Ruston had sought damages of $3 million in her suit. Though
barred from discussing the settlement, Ms. Ruston's attorney,
Thomas DeCaro said, ``We're happy with the result.''
   Two days before the jury verdict here, Audi was cleared by an
Ohio jury in the 1986 death of a 6-year-old Canton boy who was
killed when his mother's Audi lunged forward while she shifted
gears, pinning him between the car and a garage door. The boy's
parents had sued for $48 million.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. trumpeted
a new series of mid-sized computers Tuesday in its biggest product
announcement ever, and IBM watchers said the Application System-400
series would mean billions in revenue for the computer giant.
   IBM pulled out all the stops, including filling a New York stage
with actors who extolled the new computers in skits set in a bank,
hospital and toy factory.
   Advertising for the AS-400 computers will include network
television commercials featuring Alan Alda and the rest of the gang
from ``MASH.''
   The AS-400 series is the heir to the System 36 and System 38,
the biggest-selling computers ever above the ranks of personal
computers, with roughly 300,000 installed worldwide.
   IBM's stock, which has languished for months, rose $3.12{ a
share to $120.25 a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading. It was not clear how much of the rise was the result of
the computer announcement.
   IBM said the Application System-400 was the result of its most
extensive hardware and software undertaking.
   In a delicate software compromise, a team based in Rochester,
Minn., built the AS-400 so it can run programs written for either
of the predecessor machines, overcoming a troubling schism in the
middle of its mid-range product line.
   ``IBM has a real family now, and they haven't had anything like
this for a long time,'' said Sonny Monosson, editor of a newsletter
called Monosson on DEC.
   Although press speculation before the announcement focused on
IBM's competition with Digital Equipment Corp., analysts said
existing IBM customers would be the most important and easiest
market for the six models of the AS-400.
   If IBM replaced every one of the existing System 36, 38 and
older System 34 machines with an AS-400 at an average of $75,000,
it could generate $22 billion in revenue, said Stephen Cohen, an
analyst for Gartner Securities Corp.
   Realistically, Cohen said he expects IBM to bring in $800
million this year by selling 8,000 of the computers. Next year's
sales could total 20,000, he said.
   IBM said its biggest target for the AS-400 is small and
medium-sized businesses, which it called ``the biggest,
fastest-growing segment of the world's economy.''
   But the company is also hoping to place computers in the
departments of big companies _ a market where it has less of a
grasp and will face tougher competition from Digital Equipment Corp.
   Still, the AS-400's ability to run the same programs across a
wide range of machines helps IBM in its battle with Digital.
   ``They're offering everything that DEC offers. I think they're
going to prevent DEC from weaning away IBM customers,'' Monosson
said.
   In addition to Digital, IBM faces competition from such
companies as Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp., Wang Laboratories
Inc., Altos Computer Systems and various European and Japanese
competitors.
   IBM chose the longest day of the year for its eight-hour
program, part of which was televised by satellite to more than
100,000 people across the United States in what the company said
may have been the biggest private business broadcast ever. Another
70,000 people in other countries attended briefings.
   Although much information about the AS-400 computers had leaked
out, several observers said they were surprised and impressed by
the breadth of the product line. The top of the line is as powerful
as IBM's 4381 mainframe computers.
   By the early 1990s IBM expects to have built models of the
AS-400 that will be as powerful as the lower rungs of its 3090
series, its biggest mainframe computers.
   Some analysts had expected IBM to introduce some of the models
under the name AS-200, but the company decided to unify all of them
under the AS-400 name.
   IBM said all six of the computers will be available worldwide in
August. That is an unusually short lag that ensures the machines
will have time to make a big difference in IBM's 1988 revenue.
   Also unusual is the amount of software that will be available
immediately _ a crucial consideration for businesses that rely on
standard packages of programs.
   IBM and more than 130 cooperating companies announced more than
1,000 software packages in such fields as retailing, manufacturing,
finance, health, insurance and education.
   In a change of strategy, IBM worked closely with other
companies, not only on software but on the design of the computers,
which was based on extensive consultation with customers.
   ``We can't go it alone anymore,'' said Terry Lautenbach, general
manager of IBM United States.
   In a sign of IBM's dependence on others, 81 percent of the
AS-400 models will be placed with users not by IBM, but by partner
companies known as value-added resellers that add special features,
such as customized software.
   Including operating system software and data storage devices,
prices of the new computers will range from about $40,000 to more
than $1 million.
   About six in 10 of the new computers will be sold outside the
United States.

   Stock prices advanced sharply late Tuesday and
pushed the Dow Jones industrial average back over the 2,100 level
after a see-saw session influenced largely by conflicting signals
on inflation and interest rates.
   Buying intensified near the close and pushed the key index of 30
industrials 25.24 points higher to 21,109.17, more than erasing the
20.09-point loss of the previous session.
   Broader stock indicators also rose, but trading was erratic and
mixed through most of the day, reflecting considerable confusion
about the market's immediate direction.
   ``We're in a tug-of-war,'' said Peter J. DaPuzzo, manager of
retail equities at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``People have money
on the sidelines, coming in on the belief that interest rates seem
to be holding steady. But the bears are selling on fear that the
drought will cause higher prices and inflation.''
   Stocks strengthened early in the session after the Labor
Department reported a 0.3 percent rise in May consumer prices,
lower than expected. But the market weakened on fear that the
Federal Reserve was tightening credit, along with sharply higher
commodity prices caused by the drought.
   Wall Street rallied again on news from the Treasury Department
that the federal budget deficit narrowed last month to $22.5
billion vs. $35.6 billion a year earlier, initially suggesting a
significant improvement that could reduce the government's enormous
borrowing needs and thereby keep interest rates down.
   Although stocks remained higher, closer scrutiny showed the
deficit for the first eight months of the fiscal year was greater
than the year-earlier period. This suggested that stocks could
retreat again Wednesday.
   ``On the close, a lot of traders started realizing we had a
better Treasury budget number because of tax collections,'' said
Jack Barbanel, a futures strategist at Gruntal & Co. in New York.
``So it's difficult to assess whether the budget deficit really
reflects an improvement or is just temporary.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9-to-5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
937 issues up, 543 down and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 155.06 million shares,
considerably more than the 116.75 million shares traded Tuesday,
one of the slowest days this year.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 180.70 million shares.
   The most prominent NYSE issue was Texaco, up 1| to 48{ on volume
of about 4 million shares. Rumors ranged from a possible hostile
takeover attempt by strategist Carl Icahn to a large stock
repurchase by the oil company.
   IBM rose 3[ 120\ after the company announced a new family of
computers. The advance helped inspire buying in other technology
stocks, notably Compaq, up 3 to 60{; Prime, up ] to 15~; and
Hewlett Packard, up } to 54{. In the over-the-counter market, Apple
rose } to 44~ and Intel rose 1\ to 36.
   Among other notable blue-chips, Philip Morris rose 1\ to 84{;
Minnesota Mining rose 1 to 63{; Boeing rose 1{ to 56[ and Woolworth
rose 2\ to 53\.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 1.33 to
153.29.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 3.11 to 313.87,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 2.73 to 271.67.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.76
to 306.88. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 387.75, up 1.76.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
Amex and OTC issues, rose by $22.87 billion or 0.85 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower; Gold Closes Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was narrowly lower against most major
foreign currencies Tuesday amid expectations that European interest
rates would rise.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $451.70 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
up from $450.70 late Monday.
   ``We're looking at the possibility that some of the European
Common Market countries may be raising their interest rates,'' said
Jack Barbanel, a first vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc.
   The Deutsche Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, raised its
interest rate on one-month securities repurchase agreements Tuesday
to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent. Higher interest rates in other
countries make their investments more attractive and could depress
demand for the dollar.
   Barbanel said there was no indication that the Federal Reserve
would nudge U.S. interest rates higher, which would make them more
competitive with foreign yields.
   However, Ronald Holzer, chief foreign-exchange dealer with
Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago, said the relatively high federal
funds rate was evidence that U.S. rates were edging upward. The fed
funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight
loans, was quoted at 7.5 percent late Tuesday.
   ``It appears all rates are moving higher pretty much in tandem
and that portends to keep the dollar fairly well bid,'' Holzer said.
   The analysts said the economic summit in Toronto, attended by
President Reagan and the heads of six other Western nations, had
little effect on the dollar.
   ``The foreign currency markets are for the most part ignoring
what's going on,'' said Barbanel. ``It's more of a public relations
summit meeting.''
   Traders were heartened, however, by a compromise on Third World
debt reached at the meeting, Barbanel said.
   Under the compromise, nations have several options for granting
debt relief. They include extending the time period for paying off
loans, reducing interest rates or actually writing off a portion of
the loans.
   The compromise relieves pressure on big U.S. banks which have
made billions of dollars in loans to developing nations, Barbanel
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading was completed before the end of the
summit, the dollar rose 0.24 Japanese yen to a closing 126.33 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 126.45 yen and in New York, the
dollar rose to 126.42 yen from 126.31 yen late Monday.
   In London, the dollar edged up against the British pound, which
was quoted at $1.7855, down from $1.7865 late Monday. In later New
York trading, the pound rose to $1.7902 from $1.7844 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.7549 West German marks, down from 1.7607;
1.4581 Swiss Francs, down from 1.4622; 5.9222 French francs, down
from 5.9367; 1,301.75 Italian lire, down from 1,305.50; and 1.2062
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2075.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7578 German marks, up from 1.7543; 1.4623 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4580; 5.9245 French francs, up from 5.9173;
1.9755 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9730; 1,304.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,302.00; and 1.2079 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2094.
   Gold bullion was up more than a dollar on the Commodity Exchange
in New York. It finished at $451.80, up from $450.70 late Monday.
   But gold was lower overseas, falling in London to a late bid
price of $451 a troy ounce, down from late Monday's $453.90.
   It also fell in Zurich, Switzerland, closing at a bid of
$451.50, down from $452.50 late Monday, and in Hong Kong, where it
slipped $2.55 to close at a bid of $452.75.
   Silver was narrowly higher on the Comex in New York, closing at
$7.177 a troy ounce. On Monday, silver closed at $7.175. Silver
fell in London to a late bid price of $7.19 a troy ounce, down from
late Monday's $7.26.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Soar Limit For 6th Day In A Row; Soybeans Up, Wheat
Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought fears drove corn futures prices up their daily limit for
the sixth consecutive day Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybean futures also rose sharply while wheat futures retreated.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher;
copper futures surged while precious metals were nearly unchanged;
energy futures gained; and stock-index futures advanced.
   The National Weather Service's latest six-to-10 day forecast for
hot, dry weather in the Midwest through the end of the month
threatened further damage to corn, oat and soybean crops and
inspired new buying of futures contracts, analysts said.
   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain means
another 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago. Some experts estimate anywhere
from 10 to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop has already been ruined
by lack of rain.
   Still, the Agriculture Department's weekly weather and crop
bulletin rated most U.S. corn in fair condition and most of the
soybean crop in fair or good condition as of Sunday.
   Karlin said the soybean crop could hold out a little longer than
corn, but ``you're rapidly running out of this grace period before
rains are desperately needed. I think it'll be around the July 4th
weekend before yield losses occur.''
   Wheat futures prices dropped on profit-taking linked to the
ongoing winter wheat harvest, which is about 23 percent complete,
according to USDA figures.
   Karlin said the wheat market also was pressured by recurring
rumors that the USDA plans to curtail its export subsidy program if
the drought continues. The agency has repeatedly denied any such
plans.
   Skyrocketing soybean prices triggered an increase in the Board
of Trade's daily price limit on soybean futures from 30 cents to 45
cents a bushel for three days beginning Tuesday. Limits on oats,
soybean meal and soybean oil will be temporarily expanded by 150
percent beginning Wednesday.
   Limits on corn futures dropped back to 10 cents a bushel Tuesday
after three days at 15 cents.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 12 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.89{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $3.34{ a bushel; oats were 9 cents to 10 cents
higher with July at $3.18 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents lower to
45 cents higher with July at $10.46{ a bushel.
   The mixed performance of live-cattle and hog futures indicated
``drought spreading'' by traders on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, analysts said.
   The strategy _ which involves selling contracts for summer
delivery while buying those for fall and winter delivery _ is based
on expectations of increasing slaughters this summer as
drought-stressed producers thin their herds, followed by declining
supplies of animals next year.
   Pork-belly futures finished sharply higher, with some contracts
up the 2-cents-a-pound limit _ in a reversal of recent sharp losses.
   Live cattle settled .37 cent lower to .57 cent higher with
August at 63.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent to 1.12
cents higher with August at 71 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent
lower to 1.32 cents higher with July at 46.25 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.18 cents to 2 cents higher with July at 43.15
cents a pound.
   Copper futures surged as much as 5.9 cents a pound on New York's
Commodity Exchange on indications of tight near-term supplies and
growing demand, analysts said.
   Industrial metals are enjoying strong demand due to the economic
expansion of the United States and other countries, analysts said.

<HEAD>FDIC Unable to Sell Troubled Loans Taken Over in Continental
Bailout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. may try again
to sell $1.2 billion in troubled loans it acquired as part of the
1984 bailout of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co.
   The agency's first effort to unload the loans failed when none
of the bids met the minimum price or other conditions it had set,
FDIC officials said.
   ``Anytime you put something up for sale and you don't sell it,
it can be regarded as a disappointment,'' said Arthur Lotrentzen
Jr., assistant director of credit at the FDIC in Washington.
   But he said some bidders expressed interest in some of the loans
and that the agency might be able to sell portions of them.
   The FDIC had predicted that it would lose $1.7 billion of the
$3.5 billion it paid for the loans from Continental when it saved
the bank from failure four years ago.
   The attempted sale was the biggest ever by the FDIC and the
first in which the agency revealed the minimum price it would
accept.
   The agency announced it was seeking a minimum of $415.7 million,
or 33 cents on the dollar, for the entire loan portfolio, which
includes 520 loans in six industry categories.
   ``None of the bids conformed to what we sent out,'' said Thomas
Beshara, Chicago regional director of the FDIC's division of
liquidation.
   Beshara refused to say how many bids were received. Nor would he
say if the bids received by the FDIC is an indication that the
loans may be of poorer quality than the agency estimated.
   Now, however, the agency will review the feasibility of holding
more negotiations with bidders or discussing the sale of smaller
parcels of loans.
   ``The interest certainly is there in breakdowns'' of loan
categories, Beshara added. ``We're looking with a positive
attitude'' toward any future negotiations.
   The six loan categories are international, oil and gas,
commercial, personal, maritime and real estate. The largest amount
of loans, $624.9 million, is in the oil and gas field.

   Belgium's national airline Sabena said
it has ordered 16 Boeing 737s as part of a plan to renew and expand
its fleet.
   Sabena Chairman Carlos Van Rafelghem declined Tuesday to
disclose the value of the transaction at a news conference, and
company officials said that it had not been decided yet how Sabena
will pay for the planes.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes also would not give a value for the
Sabena order, but a company spokesman in Seattle said a price range
for the twinjet planes was $380 million to $444 million.
   The state-controlled company said that it would have ``a
completely renewed'' short- and medium-haul fleet by 1992, the year
that the European Economic Community is due to create a single
market with total freedom of movement for persons, goods, services
and capital.
   Sabena and its charter subsidiary, Sobelair, ordered four
144-seat Boeing 737-400s and 12 111-seat Boeing 737-500s, to be
delivered at the beginning of the 1990s.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the price range per jet is $29
million to $33 million for the 737-400 and $22 million to $26
million for the 737-500, depending on options.
   In addition, Sabena holds two previously unannounced orders for
737-300s that will be delivered in April and May 1989. It already
operates five model-300s, which sell for an average price of $28
million.
   For its long-haul fleet, Sabena last year ordered five A340-300
long-distance jetliners from Airbus Industrie to be delivered in
1993.
   Van Rafelghem also said Sabena is seeking to associate with
several other European airlines to create a European airline.
Sabena would become the nucleus of such a plan, he said.
   The executive said Sabena has had contacts with KLM, SAS, Air
France, Swissair and Luxair.
   Van Rafelghem added that the company was also holding talks with
American Airlines on some sort of commercial agreement on the North
Atlantic route.
   Boeing now has 988 announced orders for advanced versions of the
737, including 754 model-300s, 111 of the -400 model, and 123 of
the 737-500s.
   The 737-400 made its first flight earlier this year, while the
737-500 is still in development.

   One figure implicated through wiretaps in the
Pentagon procurement bribery and fraud probe agreed within the past
few days to cooperate with the government and another is on the
verge of agreeing to tell what he knows, sources familiar with the
investigation said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci decided to
reassign six Pentagon officials under scrutiny in the
investigation. He directed that anyone whose activities come under
examination must be moved to different jobs that have nothing to do
with procurement.
   President Reagan, in a news conference in Toronto, Canada,
during the economic summit, said he was ``very upset'' about
reports of wrongdoing within the multibillion dollar defense
procurement industry.
   But he praised investigators for ferreting out the misdeeds, and
said it was ``understandable how such things'' could happen in a
huge government bureaucracy.
   The person who is cooperating with the government is someone
whose voice turned up frequently on the court-ordered wiretaps that
are a central part of the two-year investigation, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors and
consultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagon
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning
contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
   It could not be determined whether the target who is cooperating
is a Pentagon employee, a consultant or someone working for a
defense contractor.
   The government frequently relies on gaining the cooperation of
participants in a white-collar conspiracy to win the conviction of
bigger targets.
   Some of the wiretaps in the two-year bribery probe were in place
for 290 days in 1987 and picked up 4,764 conversations, of which
671 were categorized as incriminating, according to federal cour
records.
   The records identify the matter only as a bribery probe in the
eastern district of Virginia, but several sources confirmed that
the taps listed in the records involved the Pentagon case.
   Meanwhile, other sources familiar with the investigation said
one wiretap involves a conversation between former Navy Secretary
John Lehman Jr. and his procurement aide, Melvyn Paisley.
   The sources said the conversation, recorded late last year or
early this year, can be interpreted as being a tip-off by Lehman
that Paisley might be under investigation.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III refused to say Monday whether
Lehman is among those under scrutiny. Paisley and another former
Lehman aide, retired Adm. James A. ``Ace'' Lyons, have been
implicated.
   The sources refused to describe the possible warning, which
investigators are examining as a potential obstruction of justice
and which occurred after Lehman and Paisley had left the government
in the spring of 1987.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said he didn't know if Lehman had
been told of the investigation by the Naval Investigative Service,
or NIS.
   James H. Webb, who succeeded Lehman as secretary of the Navy;
William Ball, the current Navy secretary, and Air Force Secretary
Edward C. Aldridge received general briefings about the existence
of the fraud probe from NIS after assuming office, Howard told
reporters.
   Webb, Ball and Aldridge did not know how the FBI had broadened
the Navy investigation, however, and Carlucci did not learn of the
probe until the day before search warrants were served last week,
Howard said.
   Meanwhile, the spokesman said, Carlucci has issued a directive
specifying that any Pentagon employee who became ``the subject of
the investigation'' must be given substitute ``duties that will not
involve them in ongoing procurements or provide them access to
information related to ongoing procurements.''
   Carlucci took the action so that Pentagon purchasing is ``free
from question,'' Howard said.
   Pentagon sources, demanding anonymity, said the directive had
led to reassignments for six employees _ five men identified last
week in search warrants, plus a sixth, unidentified employee whose
office was not searched but who is also under investigation.
   The five whose names are known include James Gaines, the deputy
assistant Navy secretary for acquisition management; Dr. Victor
Cohen, the deputy assistant Air Force secretary in charge of buying
tactical command, control, communications and computer systems,
whose office was searched last week; and George Stone, a Navy
official in the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.
   Also reassigned were Stuart Berlin, an executive with the Naval
Air Systems Command; and Marine Corps official Jack Sherman, who
works in the equipment and service acquisition section of the
contracts division, installation and logistics department.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Chief Says Record Year Will Follow Disappointing 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. had a disappointing year in its
recently-completed fiscal 1988, but may have record results this
year because of the benefits of a major restructuring, Chairman
William Spoor said Tuesday.
   ``We over-promised and we under-performed,'' Spoor said of
fiscal 1988. ``It's simple and it's pretty clear. But that's all
behind us.''
   He told a gathering of food industry analysts that the company's
financial results for the year ending in May, expected to be
released in a week, will show earnings fell to between 80 cents and
85 cents a share from $2.10 a share a year ago, mostly because of
restructuring costs.
   Without those costs, Spoor said profits in fiscal 1988 would
have been $2.40 to $2.50 a share.
   He said sales amounted to about $6.2 billion compared with $6.13
billion a year ago.
   Pillsbury reported earnings of $181.9 million in fiscal 1987.
   Spoor, who retired as chairman in 1985 but returned in March
after Chairman John Stafford resigned, said his interim rule will
end by September when a new leader is chosen from outside the
company in time for the annual board of directors' meeting.
   ``It will be his responsibility to lead Pillsbury back to
premiership,'' Spoor said. ``We've got a marvelous group of young
giants (within the company), but they're just not there yet.''
   The restructuring, which included a write-off of $141 million in
the third quarter, ``cleared the decks of a great deal of dead wood
and debris from failures of past decisions,'' he said.
   The company in fiscal 1988 closed 30 of its Steak and Ale and
Bennigan's restaurants, decided to remodel 200 Burger King
restaurants and dropped its four other restaurant chains.
   Spoor said 1989 will bring record earnings despite plans to
invest $80 million in restaurant remodeling and $50 million in
marketing and improvements to restaurant operations, mostly for
Burger King.
   Even though Burger King sales increased with the addition of 400
new locations in fiscal 1988, individual store sales remained flat,
said Roger Headrick, Pillsbury's chief financial officer, who spoke
in place of former reaturant group head J. Jeffrey Campbell, whose
resignation was announced Monday.
   ``Our most critical current issue is the lack of growth in top
line sales,'' said Headrick, who noted that a 1 percent unit sales
growth at the company's 5,600 Burger King restaurants would
increase earnings per share by 3.5 cents. ``We need to bring the
customer back.''
   Spoor said the restructuring in 1988 included a ``flattening''
of the corporate chain of command. For example, Headrick said 100
positions have been cut at restaurant headquarters.
   Spoor repeated earlier statements that Burger King is not for
sale and Pillsbury is not a corporate takeover target ``to the best
of our knowledge.''
   ``Some of you in this room have speculated on potential and
likely acquirers and even friendly merger suggestions,'' Spoor
said. ``But you are badly off base.''

   Howard said he did not know if security clearances held by the
reassigned employees had been revoked. He said it would be
premature to consider reopening previous contract competitions
because of allegations made to date, and declined comment when
asked if any military personnel on active duty were facing
inquiries.
   Asked if any defense contractors were facing a suspension of
their right to bid on new contracts because of the allegations,
Howard replied: ``There are no actions of that type at this point.''
   The investigation began with a tip from a former Navy department
employee to NIS, said a Navy source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The ex-Navy employee, working for a defense contractor, was
approached by a consultant offering confidential information for
sale. The employee agreed to have his conversations recorded with
the consultant. The consultant later agreed to cooperate with the
government and recorded his conversations with others, said the
sources.
   On Capitol Hill, former Pentagon investigator Robert L. Segal
said the Justice Department had ``substantive evidence that there
was massive fraud'' in military weapons purchases three years ago
but failed to pursue the case.
   Segal, who worked one year as the Pentagon's liaison with the
procurement fraud unit in the Justice Department, described himself
as frustrated due to ``a terrible lack of competence'' at the fraud
unit which was ``not prepared to handle'' an involved case.
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, had contended Monday that the
Justice Department could have conducted the current fraud and
bribery probe three years ago, but Meese defended his department,
saying ``that at no time has this department had to be dragged into
any indictment where the evidence is there.''
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said that while he did not condone corruption in defense
procurement, the current investigation is ``not that big a deal''
compared with the magnitude of payments and other activities during
World War II.
   ``Today's eyeballs would roll'' at the actions 40 years ago when
fighter planes were developed to counter those of the Japanese and
Germans, he said in a telephone news conference with Idaho
reporters.
   The Defense Department made public financial disclosure forms
provided by Paisley _ who worked for the Pentagon from 1981 to
March 1987 _ and his long-term associate, Gaines, the
now-reassigned deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for
acquisition management.
   Paisley, whose office was bugged and whose telephone was tapped,
listed assets of between $417,000 and $1.2 million in May 1987, two
months after he left government. His liabilities _ mortgages on
three rental properties _ were between $80,000 and $200,000.
   The forms also show that in April 1983, Paisley disqualified
himself from matters dealing with BDM Corp., an
engineering-technical services firm in McLean, Va., where his wife
worked. Previously, Mrs. Paisley was employed by Computer Sciences
Corp., in Falls Church, Va., and Boeing Computer Services in
Seattle, Wash.
   In 1986, Paisley also disqualified himself from matters
pertaining to the Boeing Co., where he had worked for 28 years,
because of questions raised by the Justice Department regarding his
prior employment by the aerospace company and his severance
payments from it. Paisley also was getting retirement pension
payments of about $29,000 a year from Boeing.
   There has been no indication that either BDM or Boeing have been
searched or subpoenaed by federal investigators.
   Telephone calls about Paisley and BDM were referred to BDM's
director of public affairs, Stephanie Bolick, who was out of the
office and not immediately available for comment.
   Gaines, who had worked for Paisley at Boeing and at the
Pentagon, listed assets of between more than $240,000 and $795,000
in a form filed in August 1987. Gaines also disqualified himself
from dealings with Boeing.
   In St. Louis, the FBI filed a list of items collected last
Tuesday in a search of the office of Thomas Gunn, marketing vice
president of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Among the items seized were:
two 1988 desk top calendars, a stenographic notebook with ``phone
numbers and information'' a memo from Gunn ``re Paisley Associates
Inc. dated 4-15-87,'' and a folder marked ATF (Advanced Tactical
Fighter). Paisley Associates was headed by Melvyn Paisley and the
advanced tactical fighter was one of the contracts about which
information allegedly was passed without proper authorization.

<TEXT>
   New York Stock Exchange member firms that do
business with the public, slammed by the stock market crash last
October, rebounded in the first quarter of 1988 to post after-tax
profits of $745 million, the NYSE said Tuesday.
   The companies lost $1.48 billion after taxes in the fourth
quarter of 1987, a period that included the Oct. 19 crash, the
exchange said. The loss had originally been stated as $2.35
billion, but was restated to reflect tax credits arising from
unprofitable results.
   The exchange said 68 percent of the 393 firms reporting for the
quarter were profitable.
   Revenue in the first quarter totaled $13.0 billion, up 30.5
percent from $9.97 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Member firms' capital rose 2.1 percent to $36.3 billion from
$35.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the exchange said.

   Monsanto Co. on Tuesday announced a product for
keeping produce fresh that it said is an effective alternative to
sulfite.
   The product, Snow Fresh, extends the shelf life of most fresh
processed produce and fruit to at least five days by delaying the
onset of browning from the effects of air and enzymes, Monsanto
said.
   Monsanto said the product was a blend of four ingredients, each
of which is on the government's list of products generally
recognized as safe. The ingredients are not processed or modified
in any way, Monsanto said.
   Sulfite has been subject to regulatory restrictions because of
health concerns.
   Snow Fresh comes as a white powder in 50-pound pails and is
mixed with water to form a solution for dipping food into.
   The product was introduced by the Monsanto Chemical Co. unit of
St. Louis-based Monsanto in New Orleans at the annual meeting of
the Institute of Food Technologists.

<HEAD>Judge Withdraws From Polaroid-Kodak Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge who ruled in Polaroid Corp.'s
landmark $5.7 billion patent infringement suit against Eastman
Kodak Co. withdrew from the case Tuesday because her late
mother-in-law owned $100,000 in Kodak stock.
   It was the second time in as many weeks that U.S. District Court
Judge Rya Zobel pulled out of a case because of an alleged conflict
of interest.
   In a statement tracing her involvement in the Polaroid-Kodak
case, Zobel said neither side objected to her mother-in-law's
holdings at the outset of proceedings in 1981.
   ``The court informed all parties (of the holdings) before
opening statements and the taking of any evidence,'' Zobel wrote.
``Throughout the 75 days of trial, Kodak's silence continued.''
   Zobel stated Kodak remained silent even after she ruled in 1985
that the Rochester, N.Y.-based camera company had violated nine
Polaroid patents when it entered the instant camera market. She
said Kodak also did not raise the issue during a lengthy appeal
process.
   Shortly after her mother-in-law died, Zobel on May 9 told
attorneys from both sides she intended to recuse herself from the
case because she and her husband had become the beneficiaries of
her mother-in-law's estate.
   The judge acquiesced after both sides encouraged her to continue
in the case and asked her for time to research the situation.
   But in a motion filed June 15 in U.S. District Court, Kodak
called for Zobel's immediate disqualification and dismissal of all
of her rulings in the case since October 1981, including the 1985
patent ruling.
   Kodak also recommended an award of less than $200 million to
Polaroid for any profits lost to Kodak's line of instant cameras
and film, which ceased production under a court order on Jan. 9,
1986.
   Noting the delay in Kodak's action, Zobel wrote:
   ``To date, neither party has submitted any authority even
suggesting the incorrectness of the court's stated postion. Indeed,
for the first time since October 5, 1981, Kodak asks for recusal.''
   Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska refused to comment on why the firm
waited seven years before objecting to Zobel's holdings, but said
there may have been some misunderstanding at the May 9 meeting.
   ``Our counsel had not understood the judge to have made final
determination to withdraw,'' he said. ``Our counsel understood the
judge asked the parties for their views on the subject and our
motion was in response to that request.''
   Harry Johnson, a spokesman for Cambridge-based Polaroid, said
the case was reassigned to Judge A. David Mazzone. He said Polaroid
believed Zobel's rulings would stand.
   The damages portion of the case is to begin in January 1989.
   Last week, Zobel withdrew from a proxy suit involving Gillette
Co. and Coniston Group case after learning that Gillette chairman
Colman M. Mockler was a fellow of Harvard College and a member of
the Harvard Corporation. Zobel is a member of the Board of
Overseers of Harvard College.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Chairman Vows To Fight Takeover Attempt By Centaur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Pennwalt Co. said Tuesday
the company would fight an buyout offer by Centaur Partners, and
rejecting a meeting with the investor group.
   ``We will strenuously fight any takeover attempt which we
believe not to be in the best interests of our shareholders,''
Pennwalt Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle said in a letter to shareholders.
   In a separate letter to Centaur, Tuttle rejected a meeting
requested by the group, saying management was in the best position
to restructure the company.
   In a news release, Centaur said the management's ``actions
reflect their concern with entrenching themselves in their jobs
rather than benefitting the shareholders who own the other 98.7
percent of the company.''
   Pennwalt's stock closed Tuesday up $1 at $80.75 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange. Based on its nearly 11.5 million
outstanding shares common sharse, the company would have a market
value of about $928.6 million.
   Centaur, which holds 7.6 percent of Pennwalt's outstanding
shares, had proposed a friendly takeover that it said would be ``at
a significant premium to the market price.''
   ``Our offer to negotiate with Pennwalt our possible purchase of
all shares at a premium in a friendly transaction still stands, but
in light of Pennwalt's reply, we are examining our other options,''
Centaur stated.
   The options include purchasing shares on the open market,
private negotiations with shareholders and merger, said Centaur
spokesman Mark Greenberg.
   In a related development, spokesman Peter McCarthy denied that
Pennwalt's efforts to sell its pharmaceutical division represented
an effort to thwart a takeover by enhancing the company's cash
position.
   ``We might not have announced our intention without the Centaur
Partners' move. But the decision to do so (consider selling the
division) was made several months ago,'' he said.
   Pennwalt's pharmaceuticals division accounted for about 11
percent of sales and 14 percent of operating earnings last year.

   If winners emerge from the drought that
has sent grain prices skyrocketing, they will be farmers lucky
enough to keep crops intact and those with surpluses from prior
harvests, a farm economist said Tuesday.
   The U.S. Treasury also could benefit if the dry spell continues
over the nation's Grain Belt, but ``agriculture as a total would be
a net loser,'' Iowa State University economist Robert Wisner said.
   In the meantime, despite grain prices nearly double last year's
highs, ``people are apprehensive of what might happen,'' said Peter
Brent, who coordinates a hot line for troubled farmers for the
rural advocacy group Prairiefire. ``Everybody's sitting tight,
praying it will rain.''
   In Iowa, which was sweltering through its third straight day of
triple-digit temperatures, soybean prices rose to an 11-year high
at elevators Tuesday, with one bid reaching $10 a bushel. Corn rose
to its highest level since September 1984, with bids over $3 a
bushel common.
   The high prices reflect fears that drought will curb harvests at
a time when 96 percent of the state's topsoil is reported too dry,
as is 91 percent of its subsoil. Still, agriculture officials said
timely rains could save most of the crop, although 12 percent of
the soybean crop is reported in poor condition and 1 percent is
very poor, while 7 percent of the corn is poor and 1 percent is
very poor.
   Eric Wahl, who raises corn, soybeans and hogs at Monticello in
northeast Iowa, said he's not had any significant rain since
Mother's Day, more than six weeks ago, and ``the few sprinkles
we've had since haven't been enough to wash the dust off the corn
leaves.''
   ``We have the potential for a pretty reasonable crop,'' if rains
resume, he said. But as dry weather continues, ``the potential for
a good crop diminishes by the hour.''
   Wahl said he'd like to be able to cash in on the rising grain
prices, which on futures markets closed Tuesday at $3.34{ a bushel
for corn delivered in July and at $10.46{ a bushel for July
soybeans.
   But Wahl isn't sure he'll have much to harvest. He said he will
need his stored corn to feed his livestock and sold his stored
beans last April when the price was $6.40 a bushel.
   Farmers who do have grain to sell are also facing tough
decisions, whether to sell now or wait for even higher prices,
knowing that any return to normal rainfall would wash out the price
rally.
   The big winners of the drought would be farmers with reasonably
good crops and large carryovers of surplus grain from previous
harvests, Wisner said.
   But most of that surplus is corn stored under government
programs.
   Farmers would have to deduct the government loan they already
have received on that crop, plus accumulated interest and storage
costs before realizing any profit on such sales, and the gain
``would be a lot less than you might think at first glance,''
Wisner said.
   He said if feed grain yields are ravaged, it will be an
especially hard blow outside the Corn Belt to operators of cattle
feed lots, large dairies and poultry operators who will face
sharply higher feed bills.
   ``For consumers it's almost certain to mean some increase in
food costs,'' he said. ``It's too early to say how much. It depends
on how long the dry weather lasts.''
   But consumers could see lower prices for meat in the near future
as some farmers thin herds because of scarce feed. However, Brent
said that could mean short supplies and higher prices later on.
   ``If we see continued dry weather well into summer, agriculture
as a total would be a net loser,'' Wisner said. ``Prices would not
go up high enough to offset the lower yields and reduced government
deficiency payments.''
   Deficiency payments represent the difference between the
government's target price for corn, $2.93 a bushel in 1988, and the
market price received by farmers enrolled in the farm program.
   With corn prices going up, there will be less drain on the U.S.
Treasury as federal deficiency payments to farmers shrink, Wisner
said.

   The drought has reduced many of the nation's
rivers and streams to record lows as it threatens navigation,
reduces electrical generation and makes beaches unusable,
government agencies said Tuesday.
   The U.S. Geological Survey reported that May had ``the lowest
percentage of (river) stations with flow in the normal to
above-normal range, not only for May, but also for any month in the
last six years.''
   The agency said 54 percent of 191 river measuring stations were
normal or better, down from 66 percent in April.
   ``In our South Atlantic Division we had a 33 percent deficiency
in power generation last week and 96 percent of the public beaches
at the division's reservoirs are not usable,'' said Bob Page,
assistant secretary of the Army for civil works.
   The Corps of Engineers has dredges at work trying to keep the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers open to navigation, Page added at a
news briefing.
   ``Normally we would expect conditions such as we have now to
occur in late August,'' added Maj. Gen. Thomas Sands, acting
director for civil works.
   And, said Page, ``We don't see any signs of its getting better
in the short term.''
   Page said low water has also affected electrical generating
capacity in the Pacific Northwest but that no electrical shortages
are anticipated because power is available for transfer from other
regions.
   The Geological Survey said the low flows reported at nearly half
the nation's streams and rivers included several record lows.
   The Saline River at Rye, Ark., dropped to only 10 percent of
normal flow, and there was only 15 percent of normal water in the
Tombigbee River at Coatopa, Ala.
   The Geological Survey reported streamflows of only 21 percent of
normal in the Peace River at Arcadia, Fla., and the Buffalo River
near St. Joe, Ark. The French Broad River at Asheville, N.C., at 40
percent of normal, also set a record low flow for the month.
   The survey said the combined flow of the nation's three largest
rivers _ the Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Columbia _ averaged 617
billion gallons per day during the month, 37 percent below normal
and the second lowest combined flow in 60 years. These three rivers
drain about half of the contiguous 48 states.
   Regionally, streamflows were lowest in California in May at 42
percent below average for the month. Flows were down 40 percent in
the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah, 29 percent in the Pacific
Northwest and 18 percent in the Southeast.
   Month-end contents of many reservoirs were lower than those of
May in previous drought years, 1987 for the West and 1986 for the
southeastern states.
   Reservoir levels were in the below-normal range in North Dakota,
Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, California and Nevada.
   Below-average levels were also reported at all five sites in the
Tennessee Valley, Clark Hill Reservoir in South Carolina and
Georgia and Lake Sidney Lanier in Georgia.
   The Great Lakes were in the normal range except for Lake
Superior, where the monthly mean fell below normal for the first
time since 1982.
   As for underground water supplies measured in wells, water
levels fell in the Southeast and Southwest. New lows for the month
were recorded for the sand aquifer near Memphis, Tenn.; the Eutaw
Formation at Montgomery, Ala,. and the Hueco bolson near El Paso,
Texas, and in a key well at Jackson, La.
   On the other hand, three record high flows were also recorded in
May _ on the Potomac River at Paw Paw, W.Va., on May 7; on the
Potomac downstream at Washington, D.C., on May 20; and on Seneca
Creek at Dawsonville, Md., on May 19.

   Heavy rain fell Tuesday on part of the drought-ravaged northern
Plains, but the road-buckling heat wave around 100 degrees gave it
little chance of soaking in, and farmers with withered pastures
turned to ``hay hot lines'' to find cattle feed.
   On the lower Mississippi River, shrunken by months of low rain
in the Plains and Midwest, barges escaped from one low-water
bottleneck but faced at least one more.
   Temperatures hit record highs Monday on the last day of spring
across the central and eastern United States and repeated that
Tuesday for the first day of summer at more than 40 cities from the
Dakotas to the East Coast, the National Weather Service said.
   Thermometers didn't have far to rise to hit records Tuesday,
with Bismarck, N.D., cooling down overnight only to a low of 77, a
record. A few minutes after noon the city tied its record of 99 and
later warmed to 103 degrees.
   Records for high temperatures started toppling well before the
sun was even directly overhead. Milwaukee tied its record of 93 at
10:34 a.m., then broke it six minutes later and continued on to
101. Other records soon began falling across Michigan, Iowa,
Illinois, South Dakota, North Dakota and Indiana.
   The official highest reading in the contiguous 48 states was 114
degrees at Phoenix, Ariz., while Hill City, Kan., hit 111 and Sioux
Falls, S.D., reached 110. Twenty-three states reported at least one
city in triple-digit heat.
   A cool front is expected to sweep from Canada into North Dakota,
Minnesota, upper Wisconsin and upper Michigan Wednesday, dropping
temperatures into the 80s and giving some relief from the humidity,
the weather service said.
   Lightning ignited dry timber and grass in northwestern South
Dakota. Firefighters were trying to control one fire that burned an
estimated 5,000 acres, while another scorched at least 1,500 acres,
state and U.S. Forest Service officials said.
   Many utilities hit record peak loads and asked customers to cut
back their use of electricity. Iowa Electric offers price breaks if
industrial customers shut off electricity during peak demand, and
those who went for the price break included Kirkwood Community
College in Cedar Rapids and that city's public library, said
spokeswoman Colleen Reilly.
   An overload caused a brief power outage in Lincoln, Neb.,
Tuesday afternoon that darkened the state Capitol and parts of the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The outage halted a meeting of the
Legislature's Executive Board and prompted Sen. Bernice Labedz to
wonder aloud if the state paid its electric bill.
   At the Blank Park Zoo at Des Moines, Iowa, the staff was busy
keeping animals cool. ``We're also freezing fish in chunks of ice
and giving them to the seals. They're having fun with that,'' said
zoo keeper Kevin Drees.
   The heat actually kept swimmers and sunbathers away from
Chicago's beaches along Lake Michigan during the hottest part of
the day, said pool supervisor Joe Pecoraro said.
   Thunderstorms over northwestern Minnesota and eastern North
Dakota dumped as much as 1.7 inches of rain in spots Tuesday, not
enough to overcome the rain deficit. Wind up to 50 mph cut power to
10,000 customers in Brainerd, Minn., for several hours.
   ``We're really thrilled to death to see that rain. We needed it
bad,'' said Dale Johnson, who farms 4,000 acres of wheat, barley,
beans, corn and sugar beats near Mayville, N.D., with his father
and brothers. Mayville got 1.7 inches. ``We've been on our knees
praying asking the good Lord for rain,'' he said.
   Parts of Ohio got up to a half-inch of rain in a surprise
thunderstorm during the night. But it didn't rain at Clyde, where
florist Cliff Doebels paid $2,000 to bring in Sioux Indian Leonard
Crow Dog to perform a rain ritual. Crow Dog promised rain by
Thursday.
   Agricultural experts said the heat worsens the drought by
evaporating what little moisture remains in the soil.
   ``These real hot days _ 95 to 100 degrees _ are using more
moisture than we can stand to lose,'' said Harold Hunzicker,
agricultural adviser in Marion County, Ill. ``We're still hanging
in there, but that is not to say we couldn't have a disaster.''
   The effect of continuing heat and no rain shows in Montana,
where the state Agricultural Statistics Service reported Monday
that 71 percent of the state's spring wheat crop was in ``poor'' or
``very poor'' condition, compared with 62 percent a week earlier.
   At Dayton, Ohio, a hay hot line was started Tuesday for farmers
seeking fodder from as far away as Kansas to feed their cattle
because their own pastures are dried out.
   ``A lot of people haven't felt the need yet,'' said Agriculture
Department spokeswoman Alice Walters. ``But if this situation
worsens, we want to have everything in place.''
   The Coast Guard closed the shrinking Mississippi River to
commercial traffic Tuesday evening at Memphis, Tenn., so a dredge
could widen and deepen a 1,000-foot section of the river north of
the city.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Donohoe said the river, at a record
low level, would stay closed for up to three days, halting up to
1,800 barges.
   That section of the river has shrunk from 500 feet wide and 15
feet deep to 170 feet wide and nine feet deep, he said. The dredge
was to dig it out to 12 feet to 14 feet deep and widen it to 300
feet.
   The freeing of a 26-barge tow that ran aground near Rosedale,
Miss., reopened the 730 miles of the Mississippi downstream from
Memphis to the Gulf of Mexico, the Corps of Engineers said Tuesday.
   ``Once they got the grounded tow cleared out there was a
nine-foot channel,'' said Bob Anderson, a Corps of Engineers
spokesman in Memphis. ``But the channel is not very wide, and
there's a pretty wicked Z-style dog-leg, so traffic is moving very
gingerly right now.''
   The Ohio River at Mound City, Ill., was closed again while
tugboats worked to refloat a barge that ran aground late Monday,
said Coast Guard spokesman Rick Johnson at Paducah, Ky. That same
section was closed last week for dredging.
   Heat distorted railroad tracks in Mobridge, S.D., during the
weekend, derailing five cars of a Burlington Northern train, said
spokesman Al Wiegold in St. Paul, Minn.
   At Sioux Falls, S.D., the heat buckled 25 roads, about the usual
damage for the entire summer, said Delmer Van Ekern of the state
Transportation Department. In Des Moines, Iowa, pavement buckled
Sunday and slowed traffic on U.S. 6 and Interstate 235.
