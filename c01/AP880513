   Retired Gen. Richard Secord,
accused of working as a middleman in the Iran-Contra affair, said
Thursday he neither expects nor wants a pardon from President
Reagan _ because one isn't necessary.
   ``I didn't break any laws, so why would there be any pardon?''
he told The Palm Beach Post before addressing the Young Republicans
of the Palm Beaches.
   ``I think we did the right thing. I'm not embarrassed about what
we did, how we did it,'' Secord said. ``I think we will prevail.''
   Secord and Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim are accused of
helping set up the arms-for-hostages deal that prosecutors said was
orchestrated by former White House aides Oliver North and John
Poindexter.
   The four were indicted in March on charges of conspiring to
divert profits from the arms sales to Nicaragua's Contras at a time
when most aid to the rebels was prohibited.

<HEAD>AZT Seen Extending AIDS Patients' Life Spans Even In Long-Term
Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of AZT, the only drug
approved for treatment of AIDS, reported Friday that the drug
continues to add to the life spans of patients who have used it for
nearly two years, according to a published report.
   Officials of Burroughs Wellcome Co. told an advisory committee
of the Food and Drug Administration that beneficial effects of
azidothymidine, known as AZT or now as zidovudine, continue even in
long-term treatment without an increase in negative side effects,
The Washington Post reported Saturday.
   While no study has documented how much time the drug adds to the
life of an AIDS patient, an unidentified FDA official said the
treatment ``adds at least six months,'' the newspaper said.
   The official said not all AIDS patients received such a benefit
from the treatment and that serious side effects prevent half of
all AIDS patients from continuing to use the drug.
   Company officials said occurrences of side effects did not
increase in patients treated as long as 21 months.
   One study of 229 people with AIDS and severe AIDS-related
complex found that 58 percent of those who received long-term
treatment with the drug were alive after 21 months, while 50
percent of those who never received the treatment were dead after
nine months, the company said.
   Another study of 4,800 people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex
who received the drug between October 1986 and September 1987 found
that 73 percent were alive 11 months after starting treatment.
   ``This is significantly better than what might be expected for
such patients had they not been treated,'' said Dr. David Berry,
vice president of research at Burroughs Wellcome.

<HEAD>Tate & Lyle Announces Takeover of Staley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British sugar refiner Tate & Lyle
PLC announced late Friday it has entered into a definitive $1.44
billion agreement to acquire Staley Continental Inc., a maker of
corn syrup and food-service supplies.
   The agreement was unanimously approved by Staley's board of
directors, Tate & Lyle said in a statement.
   Under the pact, Tate & Lyle's offer of $35 cash per common share
of Staley stock will be increased to $36.50, the British company
said.
   Staley spokesman David Satterfield could not be reached from
comment. Calls to his office went unanswered, and he did not return
messages left at his home.
   The tender offer is set to expire May 27 at midnight EDT. Tate &
Lyle's offer to buy Staley depository shares for $53.15 each and
preferred shares for $105 each would not change under Friday's
agreement.
   Staley is based in this northwest Chicago suburb. Tate & Lyle
covets its Decatur-based A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. subsidiary,
the second-largest U.S. refiner of corn syrup.
   Staley also owns CFS Continental Inc., a major producer of
single-serving condiments and other food-service supplies, which
Tate & Lyle would probably sell.
   The agreement was announced after New York Stock Exchange had
closed. Staley closed at 36~ on the NYSE, down 1]. Analysts have
said Staley has a fair market value of about $40 per common share.
   Tate & Lyle publicly began its takeover bid for all shares of
Staley common stock April 8 at a price of $32 per share.
   Officials said Tate & Lyle held 4.9 percent of the approximately
30 million outstanding common shares of Staley stock when it began
takeover efforts and has since obtained an additional 1.03 million
shares.
   The British company has said it would move Staley's headquarters
back to Decatur, the central Illinois city that was the company's
home until 1985.

   A group of 60 leftist guerrillas on Friday
night stoned and firebombed the hotel where the papal press center
is headquartered, a day before Pope John Paul II arrives in the
capital, police and witnesses said.
   The rebels, many wearing hoods and chanting revolutionary
slogans, smashed three large front windows as they paraded past the
Hotel Crillon, guests and employees said.
   The bomb, described as a molotov cocktail by employees, exploded
against a window above the main entryway, destroying the window and
setting an inside curtain ablaze, witnesses told The Associated
Press.
   There were no injuries and the blaze was rapidly squelched with
a fire extinguisher, police said. The press center for the papal
visit is headquarted on the main floor of the plush hotel, one of
Lima's finest, and many foreign journalists and tourists are
staying in the seven-story building.
   The violence came amid a wave of guerrilla activity Friday and
followed a weeklong series of rebel attacks preceding the pope's
arrival Saturday afternoon.
   Also Friday, leftist guerrillas bombed a bank and strafed a
military installation with machine gun fire from a passing car,
police said. There were no injuries in either attack.
   Police said it was unclear which of Peru's main rebel bands
carried out Friday's violence.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path began its insurgency eight years
ago. The pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement has been
mounting attacks since 1984.
   The government said guerrillas violence was expected during the
visit, the pope's second to this Andean nation, and has deployed
3,500 special police and military troops as papal security and
ordered the capital's 50,000 police officers to remain on duty
serving rotating shifts throughout the visit.

   Paraguay's authoritarian government
has withdrawn its ban on a meeting between Pope John Paul II and a
civic group that includes opposition politicians, the Vatican said
Friday.
   A statement read to reporters traveling with the pope in
neighboring Bolivia said the meeting Tuesday in Asuncion, capital
of Paraguay, ``will be held just as planned.''
   The announcement came as the pontiff urged Bolivians at this
cocaine crossroads to make war on the drug trade that ``sows your
soil with corruption and death.''
   In Lima, Peru, where the pope was due to arrive Saturday
afternoon, about 60 leftist guerrillas marching past a hotel
housing the papal press center stoned and firebombed the building
Friday night, police and witnesses said.
   Windows were broken and a small fire caused by a firebomb was
quickly extinguished, police said. No injuries were reported.
   Earlier this week, midway through a 12-day papal tour of four
South American countries, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguayan
government canceled John Paul's scheduled meeting with the Builders
of Society.
   About 350 intellectuals, businessmen and politicians belong to
the group, which is sponsored by the church and includes
representatives of unauthorized opposition parties.
   Paraguay said the ban was for ``security reasons.'' The Vatican
said it was ``astonished'' at the ``unprecedented step.''
   According to the statement, the reversal was arranged at a
meeting between Paraguayan government representatives and the
Vatican ambassador and local bishops.
   In Asuncion, Rene Recalde, president of the Paraguayan Lay
Movement group, told the Catholic radio station Caritas he was
pleased with the announcement and that the hourlong meeting would
go on as planned Tuesday night at a government-controlled sports
stadium.
   Marta de Colman, the group's press spokeswoman, said 3,800
people were invited _ 30 percent of them from the church and the
rest from social and political sectors. Among those invited were
140 members of the government, the governing Colorado Party and the
armed forces, with an even smaller number of invitees being from
the political opposition, Ms. Colman said.
   The Stroessner government meanwhile announced that only
state-controlled television and radio will be allowed to cover the
pope's activities at each stop in that landlocked nation of 3.8
million people. Church officials charged the omission of Caritas in
live papal coverage violated civil rights.
   Cancellation of the meeting would have marked the first time a
government interfered with John Paul's official itinerary on the 37
overseas trips he has made since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago.
   Celebrating an open-air Mass in sticky heat at Santa Cruz, a
frontier boom town, the pontiff delivered his strongest
condemnation of drugs on the tour.
   ``The drug trade has become a real trafficking in freedom, since
it leads to the most terrible form of slavery and sows your soil
with corruption and death,'' he told an audience the local radio
estimated at 220,000.
   ``There is an urgent need not only to protect the youth from
drug consumption but to combat trafficking itself, which is a
totally infamous activity.''
   John Paul spoke at the city's secondary airport, which U.S.
narcotics officials say is used primarily by cocaine runners.
   In his sermon, the pope ticked off a list of ills afflicting
Bolivia, ranging from high infant mortality to unjust distribution
of wealth and challenged the faithful to do something about them.
   Bolivia supplies nearly one-third of the cocaine that reaches
users in the United States and Western Europe.
   It is prepared in clandestine labs and shipped from hidden
airstrips dotting the tropical lowlands of this eastern Bolivian
zone near the Brazilian border.
   Santa Cruz, Bolivia's second-largest city with 377,000
inhabitants, is a major cocaine transit point. It has luxurious
homes, villas and country clubs said to have been built with
illicit drug money.
   Earlier Friday, the pope flew to Tarija, in Bolivia's southern
wine-producing country, to speak with children.
   Crowds surged against police lines to get near him.
   The Vatican, concerned after John Paul nearly was mobbed trying
to leave a Santa Cruz auditorium Thursday night, held an emergency
meeting with local police to discuss crowd control and logistics.
   Vatican security people said it was a question of keeping back
enthusiastic Bolivians, not preventing an attack.
   Friday was the seventh anniversary of the gunshot wounding of
the pope by Turkish terrorist Mehmet Ali Agca in St. Peter's Square
in Rome.

   Pulitzer Prize-winner Toni Morrison and three

   Morrison, honored for the Pulitzer-winning ``Beloved,'' said she

   RFK Judge William Chafe said the judges felt the book ``was such

   Mary King received an honorable mention for ``Freedom Song,'' as
did Dan Jacobs for ``The Brutality of Nations.''
   Pauli Murray, who died in 1985 after completing her memoir,
``Song in a Weary Throat,'' posthumously shared the top prize with
Morrison.

   Five years before White House stargazing
became front-page news, a Georgia congressman claimed that Ronald
Reagan consulted astrologers before selecting his running mate, a
TV station reported Friday.
   WEAR broadcast a videotape of a speech given here April 30,
1983, by Democratic Rep. Larry McDonald, describing how George Bush
was selected as the vice presidential nominee at the 1980
Republican convention.
   ``Mr. Reagan and his wife both are very avid followers and
believers'' in astrology, McDonald told a meeting of the
conservative John Birch Society. ``It's an important part of their
personal philosophy.''
   ``During the Republican convention ... candidate Reagan had some
of the various seers of the stars, those who draw up the horoscope
menus, and they had a number of interviews with a whole group of
them as to what they saw in the stars for the Republican
convention,'' McDonald said.
   ``And guess what these seers of the horoscope had to say? That
Mr. Reagan would be the nominee and that the Republicans could win
the White House only if Mr. Reagan selected George Bush as his
running mate.''
   Reagan selected Bush only days after the meeting with the
astrologers, said McDonald, who was killed five months after the
speech in the crash of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was shot
down by the Soviets over the Sea of Japan.
   The Reagans' interest in astrology was detailed last week in a
book by former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan.

<HEAD>Ohio Students Says IRS Should Cut Jargon And Say Please More Often</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is about to get
some free advice from a group of college students on how to reduce
the confusion and unpleasantness that go hand in hand with paying
federal income taxes.
   Some highlights: Give the taxpayer a simple checklist in the
tax-form instructions as a final guard against errors. Get rid of
the jawbreaking words. And please use the word ``please'' more
often.
   Twenty students at The University of Akron's Center for Taxation
Studies accepted a challenge earlier this year to prove their
argument that tax forms and printed instructions can be made
simpler.
   The students planned to present an interim report to the IRS
today, spelling out how they think instructions for Form 1040 and
Form 1040A should read.
   ``Our revision of the instructions maes filing taxes easier,''
said Nicholas Creme, director of the university's tax center and an
overseer of the project. ``It also is designed to generate
patriotism and positive feelings about the concept of federal
taxation by gently reminding taxpayers that it's the American thing
to do.''
   Part of that good feeling would be generated, presumably, by
replacing the drab cover page of the instructions with a full-color
U.S. map pointing out such landmarks as the Grand Canyon and New
York City.
   The project grew out of an appearance last March before a Senate
Finance subcommittee by Creme and several tax-center students, who
testified about problems encountered while helping low-income
taxpayers who had been penalized by the IRS.
   During that testimony, the students cited a readability study
that found more than half of Americans cannot understand the
instructions for the simplest tax form, the single-page Form
1040EZ. Only 11 percent of people with less than a high school
education can understand the instructions, the law center says.
   The students assured the subcommittee they could do better. They
hope to have their revisions of the 1040 and 1040A forms completed
before July, but for the moment they offer these suggestions to the
IRS for cleaning up the instructions:
   _Place step-by-step directions alongside the tax forms. The 1987
instructions were spread throughout the instruction booklet.
   _Reorganize the instructions so that taxpayers don't have to
read the entire booklet to see which parts of the form they have to
use.
   _Leave 20 percent more white space and use bold-face type more
often to improve readability.
   _Use simple definitions for technical terms.
   _Include samples of completed forms in the instruction booklets.
   _List on the first page a toll-free telephone number that
taxpayers can call for assistance.
   _Since most IRS penalties result from mathematical errors,
include in the instructions a final checklist that the taxpayer can
use just before mailing the completed return.
   _Get rid of multisyllable words and double and triple negatives.
   _Make ``frequent use of the word `please' to present a friendly
tone.''
   ``Almost anyone you talk to _ even accountants _ will tell you
they had difficulty filing their taxes this year,'' said Creme.
``Now the IRS says it is committed to substantially improving tax
forms for 1988 and we are pleased that we are able to provide them
with suggestions.''
   Once the students revise the instructions and the tax forms,
they will turn their attention to an even more awesome project:
simplifying volumes of IRS regulations and publications that tax
professionals must consult in dealing with clients.

<HEAD>Presidential Panel Says No to Homosexual Adoptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential panel says race should not be a
barrier to adoption but that homosexuals should be prevented from
adopting children.
   ``It is preferable to place a child in a family of his own
racial background,'' the Interagency Task Force on Adoption said in
a report made public Thursday. However, said Mary Sheila Gall, head
of the 13-member panel, ``when minority homes are not available,
those children should not wait for long periods.''
   ``They shouldn't grow up in foster care because there isn't a
family of the same skin color for them,'' Ms. Gall said.
   Ms. Gall, counselor to the director of the Office of Personnel
Management, is a single parent of two adopted Hispanic children.
   She said one organization suggested expanded rights for gay men
and lesbians to adopt children, but ``we feel that the American
public is not ready to give, and we are not ready to give, support
for homosexual adoption.''
   The 54-page report devoted only one sentence to the issue,
saying, ``The task force does not support adoption by homosexuals.''
   President Reagan appointed the task force last August. Its
report was released after being presented to representatives of
private agencies at a meeting in the Oval Office.
   Ms. Gall said Reagan, one of whose four children is adopted,
``cited what a special way this is to build a family _ to have an
adoptive child.''
   Michael Reagan is the president's adopted son.
   The task force said about 40 per cent of the 1 million American
teen-agers who become pregnant each year have abortions. Of the
teen-agers who give birth, it said, at least 90 per cent end up
raising them.
   ``A prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not get
an abortion, she must want to have a baby and take care of him
herself,'' the panel said. ``The option which gives life to a baby,
while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptive
parents, is too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood.''
   The task force recommended that other states consider a law
adopted in California that reimburses licensed, non-profit
maternity homes for the costs of care and services necessary for a
woman under 21 to carry her baby to full term.
   The panel also supported pending federal legislation under which
the adopted child of a retired or disabled worker would be treated
the same as a biological child in determining Social Security
benefits.
   The panel included representatives from the White House, Justice
Department, Treasury Department, Department of Health and Human
Services, Department of Education, Department of Defense,
Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.

<HEAD>`Modern-Day Moonshiners' Growing Pot on National Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Close to 900,000 acres of national forest and
grasslands had to be closed last year because ``modern-day
moonshiners'' growing marijuana made them unsafe for visitors and
federal employees, officials at a Senate hearing said.
   William L. Rice, deputy chief of the Agriculture Department's
Forest Service, said Thursday that marijuana production in national
forests has become a ``billion-dollar'' industry since the early
1970s and is increasingly violent.
   He told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that 886,000 of the
191 million acres of the government land were closed because of the
threat posed by growers. Rice said his law enforcement agents are
hampered by the legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana
growers for investigative purposes.
   A display of guns, grenades and makeshift weapons at the hearing
prompted Sen. Tom Harkin to observe that the marijuana farmers are
``modern-day moonshiners'' but more sophisticated and dangerous.
   Harkin, D-Iowa, and other subcommittee members endorsed the
Forest Service's request for authority to engage in ``hot pursuit''
of farmers who flee beyond the boundaries of national forests where
they cultivate their illicit crops.
   Frank G. Packwood, a Forest Service special agent for the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest in northern California, said 70
percent of the state's 872 arrests for marijuana cultivation in
1986 were never prosecuted. He said the lack of a hot pursuit
policy was a major reason.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., complaining that the $14 billion
domestic marijuana industry is ``threatening the quality of life
all over the West,'' urged approval of his bill to allow Forest
Service agents to conduct investigations, searches, seizures and
arrests outside national forests where a drug crime occurs.
   His bill also would stiffen penalties for unauthorized use of
fertilizers and chemical herbicides by marijuana growers, which he
said are ravaging foliage and wildlife in national forests.
   Wyden said Oregon has become the third leading state in
marijuana cultivation. Packwood said California is the second
largest producer of the highly potent ``sensemilla'' strain of
marijuana.
   ``In this room there is sufficient space to produce $400,000
worth of marijuana,'' said Harkin, surveying his small hearing room.
   He said marijuana is the biggest cash crop on the West Coast,
and that much of it is grown on national forests where farms are
easily hidden and the law enforcement threat is minimal.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said hunters, campers and tourists are
risking injury or death at the hands of heavily armed marijuana
farmers. He said many of the marijuana gardens are protected by
booby traps that can ``cripple or kill intruders.''
   Wyden said a sheriff's raid on a drug laboratory in southern
Oregon netted ``a cache of weapons that could outfit a small
army,'' including an Uzi submachine gun, two .50-caliber Browning
machine guns, a semiautomatic rifle, 100,000 rounds of ammunition
and 150 pounds of gunpowder.
   Forest Service officials said the growers use of a variety of
booby traps, makeshift shotguns and snarling guard dogs, some of
them trained to receive attack commands by remote radio signals.
   ``These people mean business,'' Wyden said.
   Harkin said marijuana growers are ``modern-day moonshiners, but
these are a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-terrorism bill to ban undetectable
plastic handguns is ready for a full Senate vote after receiving
unanimous approval from the Judiciary Committee.
   The committee voice vote Thursday came two days after the House
voted 413-4 for a similar bill to regulate a potential weapon of
choice for terrorists in the future.
   Plastic guns are not a problem now, because nobody is making
them. A company that possesses a patent to develop plastic weapons,
Red Eye Arms of Winter Park, Fla., says it's only interested in
developing guns for the military at this time.
   The legislation is advancing quickly without the rancor that
usually accompanies gun control issues. The breakthrough came when
law enforcement groups heavily lobbied Attorney General Edwin Meese
III to support what is now the Senate Judiciary Committee language,
and he agreed.
   Once it became clear that no existing small metal handguns would
be banned, the powerful National Rifle Association agreed to go
along with the bill, sponsored by Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Metzenbaum said he hopes to win a unanimous Senate agreement for
quick floor action. The legislation, he said, is needed ``to
protect our airplanes, our court houses and our public buildings.''
   Thurmond added: ``The Secret Service has expressed concern over
its reliance on metal detection equipment at the White House and at
other events attended by the president, because this equipment can
be circumvented by firearms with insufficient metal.
   ``As a result, the lives of the president and other high-level
officials who depend on this equipment are at great risk _ a risk
which will be reduced by adoption of this bill.''
   The Senate legislation, while aimed at plastic weapons, would
require that all firearms be as detecable as a 3.7-ounce stainless
steel handgun. All guns currently manufactured or imported into the
United States would meet the test.
   While the Senate bill sets a dectability standard, the
House-passed measure requires that the gun itself contain 3.7
ounces of metal. The House bill, sponsored by Rep. William J.
Hughes, D-N.J., deals specifically with plastic guns, while the
Senate measure sets a standard for firearms in general.
   The Senate measure also would require all guns to be detectable
by X-ray machines used at airports.
   All federal security checkpoints would have to be equipped with
metal detectors capable of distinguishing a 3.7-ounce stainless
steel gun from innocuous metal articles commonly carried by
individuals.
   The standard would require that state-of-the-art magnetometers
be installed.
   Other Senate provisions would prohibit possession of a firearm
in a federal courtroom; and increase penalties for some offenses,
including illegal possession of explosives in airports and use or
possession of explosives in commission of a federal felony.

<HEAD>Major Networks Promise Not To Call Winner Before Polls Close</HEAD>

   The three major television networks say they
will not jump the gun and call a winner before the polls are closed
in any state during November's presidential election.
   Representatives of ABC, CBS and NBC told the Senate Rules
Committee on Thursday that they would be willing to make the
commitment permanent if there were a uniform closing time of the
polls across the country.
   All three said they favored legislation to close the polls in
the continental United States at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
during presidential elections.
   Thomas B. Ross, senior vice president of NBC News, said the
network's policy is to ``project'' election results in any state
only after all polls for that office have closed in that state.
   ``Under our policy, were a national uniform poll closing system
in place, NBC News would not use election day voter polls to
project or characterize the outcome of a national election until
polls in all states were closed,'' he said.
   But Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., and Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., noted
that the networks had made the commitment previously and NBC had
violated the pact during the New York Democratic presidential
primary by using exit polls.
   Adams chaired the hearing and is a strong supporter of the
legislation. Swift successfully pushed through a similar bill in
the House in November.
   Swift showed a video tape of the three networks during the New
York primary April 19 in which NBC indicated Mike Dukakis would be
a big winner over Jesse Jackson even though many of the state's
polling places were still open.
   ``Mr. Chairman, I can assure you that it was an inadvertent
aberration and it will not occur again,'' said Ross.
   The other two network officials who made the commitment were
George Watson, vice president and Washington bureau chief of
Capital City@ABC News and Warren Mitofsky, vice president, election
and survey unit, CBS News.
   Under the legislation, polls would close at 9 p.m. in the
Eastern time zone, 8 p.m. in the Central time zone and 7 p.m. in
the Mountain time zone.
   In the Pacific time zone, daylight savings time would be
extended until the Sunday after Election Day. This provision,
affecting California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and the Idaho
panhandle, would permit a 7 p.m. poll closing simultaneous with 9
p.m. EST.
   Alaska and Hawaii would not be affected by the measure, which
was approved on a vote of 208-109 on Nov. 10.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, ranking committee Republican,
expressed concern that the two states not in the continental United
States were exempt from the bill.
   When Stevens asked if the networks would withhold declaring a
presidential winner until the polls close in Alaska and Hawaii,
each of the representatives shook their heads in the negative.
   Stevens, who said he believes election day should be a national
holiday, told the panel that he might try to open the Alaska polls
for a few hours on the day before the election and then close them
at the national standard time, which would be 5 p.m. in his state.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has been a long time since the two
superpowers have been able to count on their allies for lock-step
support of their policies and lately there is evidence that the
breakdown in discipline is accelerating.
   The signs of restiveness extend from Panama to Poland. The
demise of the concept of a bipolar world order has left both
Washington and Moscow with difficult adjustments to make.
   If the United States finds its allies balkier than before, it
can at least take comfort that the Kremlin seems to be in a similar
fix.
   May Day used to be cause for celebration in the Soviet bloc, the
occasion when the intended beneficiaries of Marxism _ the workers _
showed their gratitude to their system and their rulers.
   But this May Day, Polish authorities found themselves
confronting the most serious industrial strikes since 1982. The
government appears to have survived the challenge for the time
being but the unrest once again raised doubts about stability in
Poland and its reliability as a Soviet ally.
   In Panama, the U.S. effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
to step down is beginning its 12th week. The administration had
hoped to arrange a quick exit for Noriega and its failure to do so
thus far has become a major embarrassment.
   Recent negotiations indicate a willingness by Noriega to resign
at some point but the evidence suggests that his departure may be
based more on his terms than the Reagan administration's.
   Underscoring Noriega's contemptuous attitude toward Washington
are the gestures of friendship he has been making toward the two
principal U.S. rivals in the hemisphere, Nicaragua and Cuba.
   There are other signs of waning superpower clout:
   _Denmark, over U.S. objections, may tighten loopholes in its
existing _ though widely ignored _ ban on allowing nuclear armed
ships to enter Danish ports. Final approval of the proposal could
end NATO military cooperation with Denmark. New Zealand, because of
its anti-nuclear policies, ceased to be a U.S. military ally two
years ago.
   _Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has given up the nine-year
Soviet effort to tame anti-communist rebels in Afghanistan and soon
will begin a troop withdrawal without achieving most of his
objectives.
   _Spain has ordered the U.S. to remove 72 American F-16 fighters
from its territory, another indication of that country's
determination to limit military cooperation with Western allies.
   _The Kremlin's closest ally in Africa, Angola, has been unable
in almost 13 years to defeat a U.S.-backed rebel movement and a
negotiated settlement may be a prospect. Pro-Soviet regimes in
Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Cambodia also face internal insurrections.
   While still firmly allied with Moscow, East Germany and Bulgaria
have recently sent top officials to Washington as part of what
appears to be an expanding dialogue. Previously, Washington had
shown almost no interest in these countries, considering them to
have no room to maneuver beyond narrow limits set by Moscow.
   Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said recently the East
Bloc countries are showing more flexibility toward the United
States as a logical follow-up to Gorbachev's own reformist approach.
   He predicted that by the end of the Reagan administration, the
East Bloc ``will be a little less dependent on the Soviet Union''
and ``a little more oriented toward the United States.''
   In Latin America, the United States has not only failed to
dislodge Nicaragua's leftist government, it has been unable to
rally the support of other hemispheric countries for its policies.
   Contributing to Washington's inability to control events is a
scarcity of resources, brought on by budget deficits, and a general
tendency among many in Congress to support hands-off policies.
   The splintering of ideological blocs also appears to reflect
reduced nervousness among many countries identified with one or the
other superpower about their own internal security.
   Polls show that Gorbachev enjoys widespread sympathy among West
Europeans and even Americans.
   Reagan plans to spend Memorial Day weekend with Gorbachev in
Moscow. It's a new day when Reagan can feel more comfortable
passing a holiday weekend in Moscow with a communist chieftain than
he can at home with someone who is far more ideologically congenial
_ someone like, say, Donald Regan.

<TEXT>
   A Senate critic of President Reagan's year-old
Persian Gulf policy chided his colleagues for refusing to vote on
whether they stood behind the administration.
   ``For over a year, we have danced around the issue,'' Sen. Brock
Adams, D-Wash., said Thursday after the Senate voted 82-13 to table
his proposal to require a detailed report from Reagan outlining his
policy.
   Adams' plan, which he wanted to attach to a Pentagon budget
bill, would have given Congress 15 days to vote to disapprove that
policy. Support for Reagan's plan would be implicit if there was no
negative vote within that time.
   Neither the House nor the Senate has formally voted either
approval or disapproval of Reagan's policy of having the Navy
protect 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers.
   That policy expanded two weeks ago, when Reagan extended the
U.S. umbrella to protect neutral merchant ships if they come under
attack and seek Navy help in the war-torn region.
   There have been a number of military clashes between the Navy
and Iranian forces. The most recent occurred April 18, when Navy
ships and planes destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and sank or
damaged six Iranian vessels.
   Reagan has refused to invoke the War Powers Act, the 1973 law
that limits a president's authority to send U.S. military personnel
to situations of ``imminent danger.'' Reagan, as have his
predecessors, argues that the law is an unconstitutional
restriction on his authority.
   Adams has been defeated in several previous attempts to have the
Senate begin the process of invoking the War Powers law. He and 110
other legislators have sued to invoke the law, but a federal judge
rejected the suit and the legislators are appealing that rejection.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, criticized Reagan's policy as ``foolish
... stupid'' but he opposed Adams' plan. He said it might mean that
U.S. forces would be pulled out of the region.
   Glenn said, ``If we pull out and the Persian Gulf falls under
the domination of some other power, then it has become an
instrument for other nations.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Adams' idea because he
contended it ``would require the president to be a prophet. ... I'm
not sure the president can provide a plan, given the fluid nature
of events in that part of the world.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the plan ``is another example
of what Congress is criticized for. ... You can't have 535
secretaries of state,'' referring to the total number of House and
Senate members.
   Another critic was Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a former secretary
of the Navy. He told Adams, ``I think it would be ill-advised for
the Congress to single out any particular military operation and
say, on an annual basis, that we're going to appropriate money for
that operation.''

<HEAD>Nation's Business Leaders Predict Moderate Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders today
offered an upbeat assessment of the economy, predicting balanced,
moderate growth this year.
   In many respects, the economic forecast by the Business Council,
composed of 61 executives from the nation's largest corporations,
was even rosier than the one offered at the group's last meeting
just before the October stock market crash.
   ``Our consultants are feeling rather good about the economy. ...
They feel better than they did six months ago,'' said John S. Reed,
chairman of Citicorp. The council's economic report reflects a
consensus of views held by the chief economists of member
corporations.
   They predicted that the economy, as measured by the gross
national product, would grow at an annual rate of 2.4 percent this
year and 2.1 percent in 1989.
   When the executives last gathered for their semiannual meeting
at this mountain resort, they were expecting somewhat better GNP
growth, 3 percent this year. However, the latest forecast shows
more moderate inflation and lower unemployment.
   Consumer prices are seen rising 3.9 percent in 1988 and 4.6
percent the next year, compared with 4.2 percent in 1987.
   The executives said unemployment, which was 5.4 percent in
April, would remain under 6 percent through 1989.
   Reed said the mix of economic growth expected this year is
healthier than the 3.8 percent growth in 1987. The economy in 1988
will rely less on consumer buying and a buildup in inventories and
more on improved exports and higher spending by businesses on new
equipment, he said.
   While Reed stopped short of saying the stock crash was good for
the economy, he said, ``There were certainly good aspects to it.''
   It relieved a buildup of tension in financial markets and gave
the world's central bankers room to lower interest rates, he said.
   ``The economy and our businesses are doing quite well in spite
of that problem,'' IBM Corp. Chairman John F. Akers said, referring
to the crash. ``No one is talking about that anymore.''
   But some executives said there was a feeling that the economic
outlook was almost too good to be true.
   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Inc., said the federal
budget deficit and the trade deficit remain serious concerns.
   The executives said the trade deficit should drop below $150
billion this year, down from a record $171.2 billion last year.
   The budget deficit was expected to remain ``disturbingly high''
at $154 billion in 1988, up from $150.2 billion in 1987.
   ``Many of us continue to feel we must be living on borrowed time
to be having such good business conditions when the underlying
fundamentals are so questionable,'' Pratt said.
   Robert D. Kilpatrick, chairman of CIGNA Corp., said the budget
deficit will be the most significant economic problem faced by the
next president.
   ``Clearly, nothing will be done about it in an election year,''
he said.
   The economic forecast was issued at the beginning of a two-day
conference where the executives will be briefed by Reagan
administration officials including Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Also speaking
are Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the assistant Republican leader,
and Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., the ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee.

<HEAD>Jackson Campaigns In California, Attacks Administration Drug
Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was campaigning today in
California, where he hopes to make a final show of strength against
front-runner Michael Dukakis in the season-closing June 7 primary.
   Jackson arrived here Thursday night after three days of
campaigning in Oregon, which holds its primary on Tuesday. He was
visiting a drug-treatment center in Tarzana before heading for
northern California.
   Jackson's aides have said he will devote substantial time and
money to his effort in California, with its prize of 314 delegates.
   As he campaigned in Oregon on Thursday, Jackson criticized a
proposed deal between the Reagan administration and Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on drug
charges.
   ``It's not just Noriega. Others are dealing in drugs. We can't
indict them one day and exonerate them the next day. That is no
policy at all,'' Jackson said at a Portland news conference.
   At a rally at a Woodburn junior high school, Jackson reiterated
his criticism of the administration over Noriega.
   ``It's not enough to just say no out of one side of the White
House, then have drug dealers on the CIA payroll on the other side
of the White House,'' he said, adding: ``Our children's lives are
at stake.''
   He called for increased border patrols and for a summit with
Latin American leaders to find ways to stem the flow of drugs into
the United States.
   ``As president I will cut the supply of drugs,'' he said.
   In Halsey, Ore., Jackson joined about 300 striking workers and
their families at the James River Corp. mill, where the United
Paperworkers International Union has been on strike since April 15.
   ``You can't give up. When the going gets tough, embrace each
other and hold out until the morning comes. We've got to stay
together,'' Jackson told the strikers. ``Workers united will never
be defeated.''

<HEAD>Former Commissioners Differ on New NRC Structure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former members of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission are at odds over a proposal to reshape the NRC into an
agency headed by a single administrator.
   Former commissioner James Asselstine told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday he favors retaining the
existing structure of the agency, which is headed by five
commissioners.
   ``Properly implemented, the commission form results in a more
open and deliberative decision-making process in which competing
views are aired and considered before reaching a conclusion,'' said
Asselstine.
   Peter Bradford said a single administrator is the wrong answer
and would not improve nuclear safety. He said multi-member agencies
are more open to public scrutiny and more resistant to executive
branch control and sudden change.
   ``In addition, when running smoothly, they offer the potential
that several heads will be wiser than one,'' Bradford said.
   However, Marcus Rowden testified in support of the
single-administrator concept, calling the current NRC structure
``seriously flawed.''
   ``The commission structure impedes effective agency management,
impairs policy planning and regulatory decision-making, and _ most
important of all _ it defeats clear authority and accountability
for agency performance,'' said Rowden.
   The former commissioners directed their remarks at legislation
sponsored by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   The bill would reorganize the NRC into the Nuclear Safety Agency
headed by a single presidentially appointed administrator who must
be confirmed by the Senate.
   The measure would also establish an independent inspector
general to review allegations of fraud and abuse and a safety board
to investigate accidents at nuclear power plants.
   In addition, the legislation would give statutory authority to
the NRC's Office of Investigations, which examines alleged
wrongdoing in the nuclear industry.
   Ben Hayes, director of the investigations office, told the
committee that placement of the office under the NRC's staff
director last February dealt a ``devastating blow'' to morale. He
said all of his investigative staff members at headquarters have
said they plan to seek jobs elsewhere.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Sports Entrepreneur Considering Buying Most of PTL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failing PTL ministry is nearing
agreement on a plan to sell much of its Heritage USA theme park to
a Charlotte sports entrepreneur, The Charlotte Observer reported
Friday.
   For PTL, the plan promises a rescue from imminent liquidation of
the evangelical empire built by Jim and Tammy Bakker while allowing
the ministry to maintain control of its church activities, the
newspaper said.
   Under the plan, George Shinn would buy all or most of PTL's
1,700 acres, including a hotel and water park, and move his
Charlotte Knights minor league baseball team to a sports complex to
be built at the theme park near Fort Mill, S.C., the newspaper said.
   Shinn might also buy the ministry facilities, including the TV
studio, church and amphitheater, and lease them back to a
reorganized, tax-exempt ministry to be called Heritage Ministries,
the Observer said.
   The ministry would have an option to buy the facilities and
would have absolute control over its church functions.
   If the plan is approved, PTL trustee David Clark said Wednesday,
``It's going to be a wonderful turnaround in what's been a very
tragic situation.''
   The estimated $100 million plan is contingent on York County,
S.C., financing the $12 million sports complex, which would include
a 15,000-seat stadium and a training center for Shinn's Charlotte
Hornets, which joins the NBA next year.
   As part of the negotiations, Shinn wants state and county
officials to agree to build a six-lane road to connect the stadium
to Interstate 77 south of Charlotte, the Observer said.
   Any agreement with the county apparently is still days, if not
weeks, away, the Observer reported. The plan also is subject to
approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who already has
ordered PTL to start liquidating assets.
   ``As far as the ministry, my objective is not to take it over. I
just want to assist its recovery in any way I can,'' Shinn said.
``We would do the whole thing _ except for the ministry _ for
profit. And we would pay our taxes.''
   PTL is being reorganized in bankruptcy court with debts that
could total up to $130 million, including $82 million in back taxes
and penalties.
   Bakker criticized the deal, saying he would be ``terribly
disappointed if Heritage USA became a secular center.''

<TEXT>
   Airlines were warned nine years ago of
cracking problems in Boeing 727 wheel wells, Boeing Co. said as
authorities investigated a 15-inch crack that forced an American
Airlines 727 to make an unscheduled landing this week.
   The bulletin ``was issued because of reports from operators that
they had seen cracks in those areas,'' Tom Cole, a spokesman for
Boeing in Seattle, said Thursday. ``The bulletin alerted other
airlines that other operators have seen cracks in that area and
that they should check.''
   The bulletin was issued in 1979 and revised in 1981, Cole said.
   American Airlines Flight 984 lost cabin pressure Monday en route
from Chicago to Philadelphia and made an unscheduled landing at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The 105 passengers and seven crew
members were uninjured.
   American spokesman Steve McGregor said in Fort Worth, Texas,
that a 15-inch crack in the right wheel well caused the loss of
cabin pressure.
   The cracked portion of the airplane had been sent to the
National Transportation Safety Board's laboratory in Washington,
where investigators would ``try to get as much information as
possible about the crack,'' said Alan Pollock, spokesman for the
agency.
   The incident happened less than two weeks after a 19-year-old
Boeing 737 flown by Aloha Airlines lost part of its upper fuselage
over Hawaii. A flight attendant was killed, and 61 passengers and
crew members were injured.
   American said the two occurrences were unconnected.
   Both the NTSB and American Airlines declined to speculate on
what might have caused the crack. Clarke said it was likely caused
by metal fatigue, a weakening of the metal due to vibration.
   Cracking has become a major concern in the airline industry with
the aging of the U.S. commercial air fleet, Clarke said.
   The average age of the fleet is about 15 years, ``but that means
half are older, and it is when they reach about 20 years that you
worry,'' Clarke said.
   The American Airlines plane was delivered on Feb. 2, 1968, Cole
said.
   The Boeing 727 went into production in 1964.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush sidestepped questions about
diplomatic ``plea bargaining'' aimed at easing Panama's Manuel
Antonio Noriega out of power, as both of Bush's Democratic
opponents expressed outrage over word that drug charges against
Noriega could be dropped as part of the deal.
   All three presidential candidates were converging today on
California, whose delegate-heavy contest on June 7 will wind up the
Democratic primary season. New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico vote
the same day.
   Bush, who began a week-long Western campaign swing on Thursday,
was dogged by questions about the Reagan administration's actions
regarding Noriega, who is under indictment in Miami on drug
charges. Administration efforts to dislodge him through economic
pressure have been unsuccessful.
   ``I've learned something from experience in this _ when
negotiations are going on that are sensitive you don't discuss
them,'' the vice president told reporters in Albuquerque, N.M.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
was engaged in talks aimed at getting Noriega to step aside. ``What
this amounts to is a plea bargain,'' he said Thursday.
   Fitzwater refused to say whether the United States was willing
to drop drug charges against the Panamanian leader in exchange for
an exit. But administration sources say the indictments would be
scrapped if Noriega relinquished power and left Panama for a year.
   Bush said he favored ``getting Noriega out'' but declined to say
whether he would support dropping the drug charges in order to do
so.
   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis displayed no such
reticence on the subject.
   ``We can't indict them one day and exonerate them the next
day,'' Jackson said as he campaigned in Portland, Ore. The state's
primary is Tuesday, with 45 delegates at stake.
   ``It's not enough to just say no out of one side of the White
House, then have drug dealers on the CIA payroll on the other side
of the White House,'' Jackson said later. ``Our children's lives
are at stake.''
   Dukakis, in Washington for meetings with congressional leaders,
said: ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug
runners and murderers.
   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and
making deals, the American people deserve a full explanation of
what kind of relationship this administration has had with
Noriega.''
   Democratic non-candidate Mario Cuomo, too, was taking aim at
Bush. The New York governor, who had appearances set today and
Saturday in California, Washington state and Oregon, pledged to use
the occasion to ``have some fun'' attacking the vice president.
   Bush aides were also on the defensive about what should have
been a clear campaign boost _ President Reagan's endorsement,
formally given to Bush at a Republican fund-raiser Wednesday night
in Washington.
   The long-awaited nod came in the form of three brief sentences
at the end of a 15-minute speech, and was seen by some as a
lukewarm gesture on the president's part.
   Bush was at pains to tell reporters Thursday he ``couldn't be
more pleased'' with the show of support, and dismissed as
``absolutely absurd'' suggestions that Reagan had displayed less
enthusiasm than the occasion might have called for.
   ``Where all this flak is coming from. ... It's much ado about
nothing,'' the vice president said.
   The White House, also seeking to smooth things over, issued a
statement Thursday saying Reagan was ``surprised by news reports
that have said my endorsement ... was `lukewarm.'
   ``I am enthusiastic, fully committed and, as I have said, will
go all out to make Vice President Bush the next president of the
United States,'' the president said in his statement.
   Jackson, battered by a string of big losses to Dukakis, sought
to encourage striking paper mill workers in Halsey, Ore., with
words that sounded like a hymn to his own determination in the face
of lengthening odds.
   ``You can't give up. When the going gets tough, embrace each
other and hold out until the morning,'' he said. ``We've got to
stay together.''
   Jackson lags far behind Dukakis in the delegate race. According
to the latest Associated Press count, the Massachusetts governor
has 1,597 delegates to 944 for Jackson.
   As Dukakis has piled up more and more primary wins, party
leaders are increasingly coming into his camp. He picked up the
support Thursday of Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, two days after winning the West Virginia primary.
   Dukakis ``has shown his mettle and demonstrated his
competence,'' Byrd said.

   The New York City Ballet, in the third week of
its three-week American Music Festival, is loaded with new ballets.
And Thursday night, a juxtaposition of dance styles in a ballet
created by Peter Martins was so stunning it became the favorite so
far.
   Martins, who shares heading the company with Jerome Robbins,
named his new ballet by the music, a practice also of the late
George Balanchine. ``Barber Violin Concerto'' is for two couples.
   Merrill Ashley and Adam Luders are principal dancers in the
company. They danced in neoclassic style _ classical ballet steps
put together with originality _ to Barber's lovely melody.
   Kate Johnson of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and David Parsons,
formerly of the Taylor company, danced as guest artists in a much
more modern style. When Kate was lifted, instead of prettily
pointing her feet, she would bicycle her legs.
   This juxtaposition of styles _ sometimes both couples danced at
the same time, to the same music, in very different ways _ was
interesting. The second movement became exciting and the third
movement highly amusing.
   Parsons danced with the ballerina in a style more modern than
neoclassic, but less modern than he had danced earlier. Then Luders
danced with Miss Johnson, who became a whirling perpetual motion
machine. Sometimes he wanted to walk away from her but she was
spinning around him, jumping on his back, waving her limbs. A long
ovation followed the ballet, with many curtain calls.
   Nadia Salerno Sonnenberg was violin soloist.
   Another premiere, ``Danbury Mix,'' to music by Charles Ives, was
the second premiere ballet of the evening in the New York State
Theater. Paul Taylor choreographed it for the 18 members of his
company and they performed it. One New York City Ballet dancer,
Peter Frame, had a jolly solo to Ives' ``Circus Band March.''
   In ``Danbury Mix,'' Taylor seems to have organized his own
version of chaos. There is much tumbling, rolling and crawling
about on the floor, grotesque, spastic and insect-like moves,
diving as though into water, to land on the hands and then flip
over, deliberate bumping into other dancers. Some of it surely is
satire.
   Applause indicated the audience liked ``Danbury Mix'' a lot. We
weren't thrilled by it, but the Taylor dancers performed the
composition with amazing energy.

<HEAD>AT&T, Bell Companies, Congress Find Flaws In FCC Phone Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the
local Bell phone companies welcome a Federal Communications
Commission proposal to lift limits on their profits, but they say
the agency's alternative approach is too restrictive.
   Members of Congress are also concerned about the FCC's proposal,
but their fear is that it goes too far in loosening the regulatory
reins on telephone companies.
   The FCC on Thursday unveiled a plan to lift limits on the
profits that AT&T can earn on interstate phone calls and that local
phone companies can earn on their charges for long-distance
companies to connect to the local phone network. Instead, the
companies' prices would be capped.
   The FCC estimated that a price-cap strategy over four years
would save consumers $1.6 billion over what they would otherwise
pay under the current form of earnings regulation.
   The FCC's three sitting commissioners agreed the proposed method
would give the companies incentive to cut costs, invest in more
efficient technology and be more innovative in order to maximize
their earnings.
   AT&T said it was encouraged by the proposal, but expressed
initial concern that some of the proposed changes could be more
burdensome than current regulation. Spokesman Herb Linnen said the
company was concerned it might ``have less flexibility than we have
now, including in lowering prices.''
   AT&T, which as the industry leader is the only long-distance
company under government regulation, has been pressing the FCC for
more latitude in setting rates. Other long-distance carriers set
their rates at levels competitive with AT&T.
   Current regulation restricts AT&T from earning more than 12.2
percent and the local Bell phone companies from earning more than
12 percent on their interstate business. The companies determine
their prices under these earnings constraints.
   Under the proposal, rates would be capped beginning April 1,
1989, and companies opting for price caps would be required to cut
rates to reflect a projected productivity increase of 3 percent
each year. After four years, the plan would be reviewed.
   Most of the seven regional Bell holding companies, while
supporting the price-cap concept, said the productivity factor is
too ambitious.
   ``For the local exchange carriers (LECs) to break even under
price caps, the commission's plan would require LECs to almost
double their recent productivity levels,'' BellSouth said in a
statement.
   NYNEX called the productivity goal ``potentially unrealistic,''
and Bell Atlantic said it was ``a very challenging productivity
commitment.''
   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest
long-distance carrier, said price caps should not extend to the
Bell companies at all. MCI, fearing an increase in Bell charges for
access to local phone networks, said the Bell companies control the
local phone networks, and so should continue under the current
``monopoly'' regulation of their profits.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the new method would eliminate
incentives inherent in profit regulation for phone companies to pad
expenses and use revenues from regulated businesses to subsidize
unregulated operations.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of
the panel's telecommunciations subcommittee, said they ``continue
to be concerned that ordinary telephone customers will be worse off
under this new plan than they would be under an intelligent
administration of the current system.''
   The FCC first proposed a rate-cap plan last August, but under
pressure from Congress, the commission decided to fine-tune the
proposal by adding details. Commissioners could vote on the plan by
fall, following a three-month period for public comment.

   Nearly one-third of the American men and women
who are living together but not married are raising children, the
Census Bureau reports.
   Of the 2.33 million unmarried couples across America, some
720,000, or nearly 31 percent, were raising children as of March
1987, the bureau reported Thursday.
   That's up from 2.22 million unmarried couples, 662,000 with
children, reported a year earlier.
   In addition, the new report on ``Marital Status and Living
Arrangements'' found some 1.55 million couples of the same sex
living together, including 92,000 with children. That is up from
1.47 million same-sex couples a year earlier, also including 92,000
with children.
   A same-sex couple could include anything from a parent and an
adult child living in the same household, homosexual partners or
individuals who happen to share living quarters. The Census Bureau
does not ask the sexual preference of individuals.
   Arlene F. Saluter, of the Bureau's Population Division, said the
data in the new study showed a continuation of the general trends
of recent years, with no major corners being turned. For example,
the study found:
   _Among children under age 18 nearly one in four (23.9 percent)
lived with just one parent, up from 23.5 percent in 1985.
   _There were 130 divorced Americans for every 1,000 still married
and living with their spouses, down from 131 in 1985.
   By comparison, figures released last fall showed more than 51.5
million married couple households in the nation in 1987, up from
50.9 million a year earlier. That, too, has been rising as the
massive post World War II Baby Boom generation forms families.
   While the vast majority of the unmarried couples are younger
people, the category also includes others, such as elderly widows
who rent rooms to college students, Census officials note.
Unmarried couples are simply defined as two unrelated individuals,
of the opposite sex, who share a housing unit.
   Of the 1987 unmarried couples, 1.41 million listed a man as the
householder _ formerly known as the head of household. Of those,
395,000 households included children.
   In addition, 922,000 unmarried couples listed the woman as
householder, including 325,000 with children.
   In households consisting of two adults of the same sex, 803,000
were two men, and of these 11,000 reported having children. The
remaining 748,000 consisted of two-female households, and these
included 81,000 with children.
   The report on unmarried couples found that of the 1.41 million
with a male householder, 815,000 included a woman who had never
been married.
   Some 86,000 of the women in these households were still married
to someone else. There were 440,000 divorced women in these couples
and 73,000 widows.
   For the 922,000 unmarried couples listing a female householder,
561,000 included a man who had never been married. There were
59,000 which included a man still married to another woman, 29,000
with widowers and 272,000 divorced men.
   In most of these unmarried couples, both partners were in the
same age group, the report found, with the exception of men aged 35
to 44 and men aged 65 and over.

<HEAD>Bush Takes On Dukakis As He Campaigns In California</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is painting Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis as ``an extremely liberal Democrat''
who is far to the left on military matters _ a portrait the vice
president hopes will help him win the West in November.
   At a high-tech defense plant in New Mexico and in
military-minded San Diego, Bush hit the Massachusetts governor on
defense, saying Dukakis would cause ``a radical swing'' in the
nation's military policies.
   Bush, the apparent Republican nominee, also tried to draw
attention away from a minor flap over President Reagan's
endorsement of his bid. Reagan's formal expression of support,
delivered Wednesday night, was judged lukewarm by some.
   ``This is what I call a piranha circling in the water over what
they think is a drop of blood. They're going to starve to death
because there is nothing there, nothing there,'' the vice president
said in Albuquerque, N.M. ``It's totally absurd.''
   By the end of the day, Bush was downplaying the endorsement from
the man he has loyally served for seven years.
   ``People thought all along the president was for me. So I don't
think the specific endorsment means something,'' Bush said. ``But I
think the Reagan record, or the Reagan-Bush record if you will, is
well-regarded. ''
   On a seven-day Western swing to states where he needs strong
support to win the general election, Bush talked as if the fall
campaign had already begun. Over and over again, he referred to
Dukakis and his remaining Democratic opponent Jesse Jackson as
extreme on defense.
   ``We are going to have a traditional campaign...of one extremely
liberal Democrat...against me,'' Bush told reporters in San Diego.
   He planned another high-tech plant visit and a San Diego air
show appearence today.
   Later Bush described Dukakis as ``over there somewhere _ and I'm
not just making charges _ between McGovern and Mondale, somewhere
there on defense.''
   George McGovern, the party's 1972 nominee, called for dramatic
cuts in defense spending, while Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democrtic
standard-bearer, opposed some Reagan military programs.
   In speeches in New Mexico and California, Bush aimed at
Democratic defense policies.
   ``We cannot afford a radical swing. We cannot afford president
who opposes every step we are taking to keep our defense at the
technological edge, who opposes the MX, who opposes the Midgetman,
who opposes testing of nuclear weapons, who opposes flight testing
of ballistic missiles, who opposes testing of anti-satellite
weapons, who opposes the building of a strategic defense, and who
flirts with the withdrawal of our troops from South Korea,'' he
told the Albuquerque Rotary Club after a defense-plant tour.
   At one point, Bush joked about the endorsement flap.
   ``You may have seen that the president endorsed me last night.
That was a relief,'' he said as the Rotary Club audience laughed.
``It's been tough for me trying to keep my charisma in check for
seven years.''
   Talking to reporters, Bush said Reagan's endorsement was ``just
great...I couldn't have been more pleased.''
   The White House, responding to reports describing the
endorsement as lukewarm, put out a follow-up statement on Thursday.
   ``I am enthusiastic....George has been a partner in all we have
accomplished and he should be elected. He has my full confidence
and my total support,'' Reagan said in the statement.
   On another topic, Bush refused to answer questions about a
reports of a U.S. offer to Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noreiga that would involve dropping American drug trafficking
charges in exchange for Noriega's stepping down from power.
   ``I favor getting Noriega out,'' Bush told reporters as he
toured a Honeywell Defense Avionics plant in Albuquerque. ``I've
learned something from some experience in this _ when negotiations
are going on that are sensitive, you don't discuss them.''

   A federal judge Thursday barred the
back-to-nature Rainbow Family from holding a ``tribal council'' on
government forest land this weekend.
   U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice accepted a federal
magistrate's opinion that the gathering of about 500 people could
violate ``laws relating to drugs and nudity in such substantial
numbers that law enforcement would be rendered effectively
unmanageable.''
   Prior to the ruling, Rainbow Family spokesman Stephen Principle
said the weekend council, as well as a July event that could draw
20,000 people, will go on despite efforts by the U.S. Forest
Service to block the gatherings.
   ``I don't know who can stop this,'' Principle said. ``All our
literature every year has said, `Ignore any rumors of
cancellations, regardless of source.'''
   The Rainbow Family, a peace and environmental group with no
leader and no headquarters, was invited by the Forest Service to
apply for permits to hold the gathering but declined. The
organization said it never seeks permits.
   Lufkin is 119 miles northeast of Houston.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ventured into a
major cocaine-trafficking zone in this Andean country. In Paraguay,
a confrontation between the church and the rightist military regime
heated up.
   Today, the pontiff was to visit the 400-year-old wine-producing
city of Tarija, near the Argentine border, then return to Santa
Cruz for a large outdoor Mass.
   His face reddened by the intense sun of earlier stops in the
Andes mountains, John Paul flew Thursday to Santa Cruz, in the
tropical lowlands of eastern Bolivia, the center of the nation's
illicit cocaine trade.
   The pope addressed intellectuals in a parochial school, where he
criticized the ``brain drain,'' the flight of skilled professionals
from poor third-world countries to developed countries, where they
can earn more money.
   Among those greeting the pontiff in Santa Cruz was Simon Reyes,
first secretary of Bolivia's small, legal Communist Party and also
executive secretary of the country's main labor confederation.
   Reyes gave the pope a letter that mentioned Bolivia's acute
unemployment problem and said: ``You give us hope to keep
fighting.''
   In his frequent trips abroad, the Polish-born pope has given the
Roman Catholic Church's backing to demands of workers, but rejects
communism as a way to solve labor problems.
   The Vatican on Thursday fired a salvo in a confrontation with
Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay. Stroessner on
Wednesday canceled a meeting the pontiff had scheduled for next
week in Paraguay with a group of civic and political leaders,
including opposition figures.
   ``I must clearly state the astonishment caused by a decision
without precedent in the exercising of the pastoral mission by the
Holy Father,'' chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.
   It was the first time in John Paul's 37 overseas missions that a
foreign leader had prohibited a previously announced papal event.
The pope is to visit Paraguay on Monday.
   On Thursday, Paraguayan police dragged six opposition figures
out of a small-town church during Mass and placed them under arrest.
   Stroessner, in power since 1954 and the longest-reigning
dictator in the Western Hemisphere, said a meeting between the pope
and ``Builders of Society,'' a church-sponsored group of about 350
intellectuals, business people, union leaders and politicians could
not be held because of ``security reasons.''
   About 3,000 people were expected at the encounter, which had
been scheduled for Tuesday in a government-run sports complex in
Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital.
   Church officials in Asuncion said they would try to hold the
meeting in another, unspecified place.
   Tensions between the church and the Paraguayan government have
been building for some time. Bishops there have been increasingly
critical of Stroessner's authoritarian style and poor record on
human rights.
   The Paraguayan church has campaigned for a pluralistic political
system and Paraguay's Catholic radio station, Caritas, has given
Stroessner's opponents air time.
   The pope arrived Saturday in tiny Uruguay, on South America's
Atlantic coast. On Monday, he flew to mountainous Bolivia, After
less than two days in Peru, on the Pacific coast, he is to go to
Paraguay, his last stop.
   John Paul is to return to the Vatican next Wednesday, his 68th
birthday.

<HEAD>Veterinarian Fails To Save Kissinger's Dog</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinarian who treated Henry
Kissinger's dog for cancer says he was impressed with the devotion
that the former secretary of state showed to the dying animal.
   ``I was expecting Kissinger to be a little intimidating,
considering his stature in the world, But he was just a regular guy
who loved his dog,'' said Gregory MacEwen, a University of
Wisconsin veterinarian.
   MacEwen met Kissinger last month for a few hours when MacEwen
flew to New York to treat Kissinger's ailing yellow Labrador
retriever for cancer. The dog died last week, MacEwen said.
   ``He got right down on the floor with his dog in his three-piece
suit, talking to him, totally flat out, just telling Tyler (the
dog) how much he loved him,'' MacEwen said.
   The dog suffered from a form of bone cancer that spread to the
dog's spine and paralyzed it.
   MacEwen said an innovative liposome cancer treatment, which uses
the body's own immune system to attack the cancer, may have worked
had the disease not progressed to the spine.
   However, the dog lived out its life in less pain, he said.
   Kissinger went to the National Cancer Institute after learning
the dog had cancer. Kissinger wanted to avoid chemotherapy because
of the dog's ill health and age, MacEwen said.
   A former NCI official recommended that Kissinger contact MacEwen.

<HEAD>Oil Price Drops Push Soviets Toward Barter Deals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department marketing expert
says the drop in world oil and gold prices in recent years has had
``a dramatic effect'' on the Soviet Union's trade with the United
States.
   As a consequence, the Soviet Union would much prefer having
barter arrangements with foreign trading partners instead of having
to spend its short supply of foreign currency for imports, such as
huge orders of U.S. wheat and corn.
   ``Foreign currency is tight for the Soviet government, which in
turn has decreased the Soviet Union's buying power significantly,''
said Thomas Hamby of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Hamby, now the agency's deputy director of marketing for dairy,
livestock and poultry, recently returned from Moscow after two and
a half years as U.S. agricultural attache. His remarks were
included Thursday in the June issue of the agency's Foreign
Agriculture magazine.
   Trade talks between Moscow and other countries are increasingly
turning into barter negotiations, he said. The Soviets make it
plain they are in a better position to exchange their products for
foreign goods than to pay in foreign currency.
   ``This is a difficult constraint on trade from the U.S.
standpoint,'' Hamby said. The Soviet Union simply does not have the
ability to supply the quantity or quality of either agricultural or
non-agricultural products which would make a barter arrangement
feasible.''
   Hamby said the United States imports only about $25 million
worth of Soviet agricultural products each year, while the Soviet
Union's imports of U.S. farm products averages around $2 billion
annually.
   ``This situation has led to continuing Soviet pressure to lift
U.S. import restrictions on Soviet furskins and other commodities,
and pressure for most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, which
would give the Soviet Union preferential access to the U.S.
market,'' he said.
   Under the MFN principle, the United States would grant the
Soviet Union the same trading privileges that it offers most other
foreign trading partners. The MFN designation for the Soviet Union
has been held up for years because of Moscow's restrictive
emigration policies.
   These issues are likely to persist in any trade negotiation
between the Soviet Union and the United States, Hamby said.
Currently, negotiators are working on a successor to the five-year
grain agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States.
   That pact, which will expire on Sept. 30, commits the Soviet
Union to buy minimum quantities of U.S. wheat and corn each year.
   ``The Soviets' foreign currency deficit also has led to
trade-offs in what is imported,'' Hamby said. ``Agricultural
commodity imports have increasingly faced competing demands for
high-priority technology such as plant and equipment among Soviet
planners.''

   Some new procedures have been designed by the
Agriculture Department to regulate the inspection of imported meat
and poultry, including the permanent marking of shipments that fail
to meet U.S. standards.
   Each consignment that fails to pass U.S. inspection would be
stamped ``U.S. Refused Entry'' on each carcass or packing
container, Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said Thursday.
   ``This will help ensure that rejected meat and poultry does not
get into the human food supply in the United States,'' he said.
``It will also warn other countries where the products might be
subsequently shipped that the U.S. has rejected the items.''
   Products that are refused entry must be removed from the United
States, converted to animal food or destroyed. Previously, such
products were identified with temporary placards and had to be
closely monitored by USDA employees.
   The new regulation, which takes effect June 12, also will
eliminate a requirement that products refused entry be sealed
before being transported in the United States, since the permanent
markings will serve to identify them.
   Crawford said the new rule also reinstates the practice of
``controlled pre-stamping'' in which import inspectors can put
their ``passed'' mark on containers of imported products before the
inspection has been fully carried out.
   This procedure is especially useful at cold storage facilities,
so that meat and poultry can be stamped and samples taken for
testing and inspection. If there are no problems, the products
don't have to be handled again, he said. If the products fail
inspection, inspectors can remove the marks and stamp the products
indelibly as refused.
   In a related action, the agency announced a proposal to allow
imported meat and poultry to be inspected only at the port where
the products are unloaded. Currently, the products can be shipped
across the country to another port for checking by USDA inspectors.
   Crawford said the proposal, which will be open for public
comment until July 12, would give federal inspectors ``much better
control of imported products entering food channels'' in the United
States.

<HEAD>Food Prices In State Stores Raised Up To 60 Percent In Beijing,
Shanghai</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for pork, eggs and other non-staple foods
are rising by up to 60 percent in state-owned stores in Beijing and
Shanghai as part of government efforts to phase out subsidies,
official reports say.
   Food bills of urban shoppers already have climbed sharply in the
past few years due to growing demand and stagnating grain and pig
production.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Thursday that state stores
in Shanghai this week increased the price of pork 60 percent and of
eggs 30 percent.
   A separate Xinhua report said prices for pork, eggs, vegetables
and sugar in state stores in Beijing would be raised by 30 percent
to 60 percent as of Sunday. It did not detail the increases for
each item.
   Pork has sold for about 50 cents a pound in state stores in
Beijing. Eggs have cost about 25 cents a pound.
   Both cost more on the unsubsidized free market.
   The average urban worker earns about $27 a month.
   Beijing and Shanghai soon will begin distributing monthly
subsidies to compensate for the price increases. Xinhua said in
Beijing the subsidies will be $2.16 for college students and $2.70
for workers and retirees.
   Xinhua said the increases in Beijing are expected to add $1.76
each month to the average person's food bill.
   Overall, retail prices rose 11 percent nationwide in this year's
first quarter, but official reports have said vegetable prices in
free markets have increased up to 40 percent in some cities over
the past year.
   For years, the government suppressed inflation by fixing prices
for goods and subsidizing the difference between the production
cost and retail price.
   As part of its decade-long program of reducing central planning
and increasing the role of market forces, the government has
reduced the number of items sold at fixed prices and raised prices
still under state control.
   The State Administration for Commodity Prices said last week
that the government eventually plans to stop setting prices
altogether for pork, eggs, vegetables and sugar.
   Premier Li Peng, who has advocated moving gradually to
rationalize prices, was quoted by Xinhua Thursday as telling a
meeting of mayors from 10 cities that each should move toward
letting the free market set prices.

<TEXT>
   David Steel, leader of Britain's
centrist Liberal Party for 12 years, has announced that he will not
be a candidate to lead the newly merged Social and Liberal
Democrats.
   Steel, 50, on Thursday told party workers at Galashiels in his
Scottish electoral district: ``Those who have urged me to stay
should not feel let down.''
   The new party, formed through a merger this year of the Labor
and Social Democratic parties, is to elect its leaders in July.
   Steel said his leadership was the longest in the history of the
150-year-old Liberal Party except for Herbert H. Asquith, who led
it for 18 years until 1926 and was prime minister from 1908-1916.
   He said he intends to remain a legislator in the House of
Commons.
   The Liberals formed an electoral alliance in 1981 with people
who broke away from the Labor Party and formed the Social
Democratic Party, claiming Labor was moving too far to the left.
   Steel was joint leader of the alliance with Social Democratic
leader David Owen, a former Labor foreign secretary.
   Members of the two parties decided by majority votes to merge
after failing in their aim to supplant Labor as the main opposition
to the governing Conservatives. They won just 22 of the 630 House
of Commons seats in the June 1987 general election.
   Owen opposed the merger decision and has relaunched a new Social
Democratic Party under his own leadership.

<TEXT>
   A cleaning supervisor has become the first
fatality among 34 known cases of Legionnaires' disease in an
outbreak at British Broadcasting Corp. headquarters, the BBC says.
   Forty-four other cases are suspected in the outbreak in and
around the BBC, and six of the remaining 33 confirmed victims are
seriously ill, the borough of Westminster said.
   Jim Morgan, who supervised cleaning operations in headquarters
buildings in central London, was admitted to a hospital two weeks
ago, one of the first cases in the outbreak, and died Thursday. He
was 63.
   Legionnaires' disease, which produces symptoms similar to
pneumonia, is often caused by bacteria from water-cooled air
conditioning units.
   The BBC said its air systems in the Broadcasting House and a
nearby building have been disinfected.
   The disease was first diagnosed in 1976 after 221 people
contracted it in Philadelphia, and it takes its name from the
outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention there.

<TEXT>
   Two robbery suspects holding a police
officer hostage Thursday night demanded drugs in exchange for the
officer's life, authorities said.
   The hostage told his fellow officers that the pair are desperate
and will kill him unless they are provided with the drugs, said
Henry Groepper, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau.
   Groepper said the officer, whose name was not immediately
released, was a veteran who was handling the situation ``real
well'' under the circumstances.
   A hostage negotiation team was in place and the officer was
acting as an intermediary over the telephone and a police radio,
Groepper said. He said the gunmen were asking for Dilaudit, a form
of morphine used in cough syrup.
   The officer was taken hostage while he was investigating a
robbery that occurred about 7 p.m. at a Safeway store in the
southwest part of the city.
   The officer checked a tip that two suspicious men were staying
at the nearby Portland Rose Motel and he went to their room, where
he was admitted by one man, Groepper said.
   Other officers brought witnesses from the grocery robbery who
identified the man as a suspect. As the officers were handcuffing
the suspect, another man emerged from the bathroom and pointed at
gun at police.
   ``Don't anyone do anything foolish,'' Groepper quoted the man as
saying.
   The gunman took one officer hostage and forced the others out of
the motel room.
   Asked whether police would meet the demands, Groepper said:
``We'll take it as it comes.''

   A judge acquitted the wife of a former

wealthy Dublin dentist.
   Judge Liam Hamilton of the anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court
on Thursday cleared Clare O'Hare, 27, of a charge of falsely
imprisoning 38-year-old dentist John O'Grady.
   He said the prosecution had not proven that Mrs. O'Hare, who is
seven months pregnant, knew of the kidnapping.
   Dessie O'Hare, 29, was sentenced last month to 40 years in
prison on charges of falsely imprisoning the dentist and
maliciously wounding him.
   Police said a five-man gang led by O'Hare chopped off the tips
of two of O'Grady's fingers during the dentist's 22 days in
captivity.
   O'Grady was freed by police in a Dublin house on Nov. 5.
   O'Hare is a former member of the Irish Republican Army and Irish
National Liberation Army, which are fighting to rid
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule.

   Dukakis has picked up the endorsement of Iowa Democratic
Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell and all five statewide Democratic

   The VISA card issued by Indiana National Bank could raise as
much as $200,000 a year for the state Democratic party, said state

   The Democratic Party will make a profit off the card by taking a
cut of the fees, typically 5 percent per purchase charged to
merchants and paid to credit card companies.
   The Indiana Democrats will take one-half of 1 percent, said
party treasurer Larry Cummings.
   The card which has a 16.8 percent interest rate and a $3,000
credit line, features a silhouette of a bucking donkey, the party's

   Republicans in the state had considered the affinity card idea
but dropped it after deciding too many such cards were already on

<HEAD>Report: SEC Investigating Shopping Center Developer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating whether shopping center and sports magnate Edward J.
DeBartolo Sr. secretly helped a corporate raider accumulate stock
in companies targeted for takeover, a published report said today.
   The SEC is also trying to determine whether DeBartolo improperly
concealed multimillion-dollar loans to Paul Bilzerian, his
relatives and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. employees to acquire stock
in takeover targets Hammermill Paper Co. and Cluett Peabody & Co.,
The Washington Post reported.
   Other focuses of the SEC's DeBartolo-Bilzerian probe include
Allied Store Corp., Carter Hawley Hale, H.H. Robertson Co., Armco
Inc. and Fruehauf Corp., the Post said, citing subpoenas and other
documents.
   DeBartolo Corp., based in Youngstown, Ohio, is one of the
nation's leading shopping center developers. In addition to the
shopping centers and other real estate, DeBartolo Corp., owns the
San Francisco 49ers football team and the Pittsburgh Penguins
hockey team.
   The Post said documents related to the DeBartolo investigation
became public in a dispute over the company's production of papers
requested under SEC subpoenas. SEC lawyers went to U.S. District
Court in the District of Columbia to obtain the documents, and a
settlement was reached last week that provides for the records to
be made available to the agency.
   The SEC subpoena seeks information from DeBartolo about certain
stock trading and telephone records between January 1985 through
July 1987, the newspaper said.
   ``The matter is in the hands of our lawyers and we have been
cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the
investigation,'' DeBartolo told the newspaper through his
spokesman, attorney Stephen Flood. A spokesman for Bilzerian
declined to comment.

<HEAD>Study: Depressed Youths Predisposed To Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of chemical abnormalities in
depressed teen-agers intent on killing themselves could provide a
better understanding of suicide and help identify those likely to
self-destruct, researchers say.
   ``The things we learn on this may well help future tests to
identify the highest risk for suicides, and that can make a
difference in the treatment,'' said Dr. Neal D. Ryan, assistant
professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.
   The brains of suicidal adolescents secrete smaller amounts of a
growth hormone than those of healthy teen-agers, according to
research by Ryan and Dr. Joaquin Puig-Antich, professor of
psychiatry at Pitt.
   The study, reported Thursday at the American Psychiatric
Association's annual meeting in Montreal, is believed to be the
first to demonstrate neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal
adolescents.
   ``It's not purely a mind phenomenon,'' Ryan said. ``There's
something that goes on with the brain, and there are environmental
phenomena that impinge on that.''
   Earlier studies have found similar abnormalities in the brains
of suicidal adults, although experts are divided as to what
conclusions can be drawn.
   ``Nothing has worked out as a diagnostic tool,'' said Irma Lann,
a science administrator in child and adolescent disorders research
for the National Institute of Mental Health.
   Ms. Lann called the researchers' work interesting but
preliminary, and said further study is needed.
   ``We've made a big step toward understanding, identifying, the
risk for suicide. But we're not there yet,'' said Dr. David Brent,
a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who specializes in
adolescent suicide.
   Youths 19 and under accounted for 2,127 of the 29,453 suicides
committed in the United States in 1985, the last year for which
figures are available, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics. About 80 percent of them were boys.
   Boys and girls are afflicted about equally by depression, one of
the main forces behind suicide. More girls attempt suicide, but
more boys succeed at it, Ryan said.
   However, therapists may be mistaken in treating suicidal
teen-agers much the same as depressed adolescents, Puig-Antich said.
   ``What it (study) points out is that the biology of suicide may
be different than the biology of depression,'' he said. ``If so,
there may be treatment for suicidal depressives that is different
than treatment of patients with depression.''
   From 1980 to 1987, Puig-Antich and Ryan monitored the growth
hormone secretion of 140 carefully selected adolescents ranging in
age from 12 to just under 18. The tests were conducted while the
subjects slept.
   Most growth hormone secretion occurs during sleep, especially
during the first several hours, Ryan said. At least three
neurotransmitter systems in the brain are involved in controlling
sleep growth hormone secretion, which also affects moods.
   Thirty-four youngsters who suffered from major depression and
had attempted suicide or devised a suicide plan secreted less
growth hormone than 40 depressed but non-suicidal students and 66
healthy children, whose levels were about the same, Ryan said. The
subjects' sex was not a factor.
   Later, 43 students were given a shot of Desipramine, an
antidepressant known to stimulate the release of growth hormone.
   Eight depressed, suicidal youths who received the shot had less
growth hormone released than the 12 depressed but non-suicidal
students and 23 healthy adolescents, Ryan said.
   Puig-Antich said the research ``definitely can help in
prevention, especially if we can know ahead of time who are at the
greatest risk.''

<HEAD>FAA Proposes $6.5 Million in Fines Against 15 Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1.26 million fine against United Airlines
is among the nearly $6.5 million in penalties the Federal Aviation
Administration says it wants to impose on airlines for alleged
safety and security violations.
   Fifteen of the nation's airlines face the penalities, which have
been proposed in letters from the FAA. If an airline can show a
charge is unfounded, the fine can be reduced.
   Chicago-based United is targeted for the biggest fine. The next
highest proposed fine is against Hawaiian Airlines, $1.17 million,
followed by Continental, $982,130; Eastern Airlines, $893,500;
Braniff, $518,000; American Airlines, $421,250; and Northwest
Airlines, $371,000.
   The other airlines listed in the FAA's documents and the
proposed fines are: Pan Am, $264,500; USAir, $166,100; Delta,
$147,250; Midway, $128,000; TWA, $118,000; Southwest, $56,500;
America West, $1,500; and Alaska, $1,000.
   According to the FAA, $705,850 of the fine pending against
United was imposed after the airline removed vapor-seal covers from
the wings of its 19-plane fleet of 767s for about a month. The
covers, the agency said in its letter to United, are supposed to
vent leaked fuel from the wing. Without them, the FAA said, there
is a risk of fire.
   A spokesman for United, Dan Sheehy, said it was too soon to
discuss the proposed penalties publicly because ``they are
currently being discussed between United and the FAA. It really
would be inappropriate to comment further.''
   The FAA said a major part of Hawaiian's proposed fine was
prompted by the airline's alleged delay in replacing a damaged
sleeve on a DC-9's wheel and brake assembly. A spokesman for
Hawaiian could not be reached immediately for comment.
   Continental, meanwhile, faces more than $200,000 in proposed
fines for allegedly failing to comply with several 1987
airworthiness directives requiring inspections of engines and
pressure bulkheads on a leased Boeing 727.
   Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Continental, said the airline is
seeking to have some of its $982,130 in fines reduced but he didn't
know specifically which fines were being contested.
   ``These are by and large issues that are many months to more
than a year old,'' Hicks said in a telephone interview from
Continental headquarters in Houston. ``Two-thirds of the issues
were actually referred to the FAA by Continental. ... That's the
way the industry is supposed to work.''
   The FAA also proposed fining Braniff for alleged inadequate
surveillance of its inspection and maintenance programs and
American for alleged operating a Boeing 727 despite pilot
complaints that two of the engines weren't accelerating rapidly
enough.
   The FAA made the list of proposed fines available to The Wall
Street Journal and The Washington Post in response to requests. The
agency released the documents to The Associated Press on Thursday.

legal action would be taken against them. But Cerezo did say that
none of the leaders of the country's 14 legally registered
political parties was involved.
   ``For the moment, we can announce that legal action will be
taken in the case ... against those civilians who participated in
the capacity of intellectual planners in the rash attempt,'' he
said.
   Cerezo made his comments during a visit to the Finance Ministry.
   Troops arrested two army officers Wednesday morning who were
leading soldiers toward the capital, Defense Minister Gen. Hector
Alejandro Gramajo Morales said Wednesday.
   He said the two had led officers and soldiers from bases in
Jutiapa, 75 miles south of Guatemala City, and Retalhuleu, 115
miles southwest of the capital.
   The government has not said how many mutineers were involved or
whether there was any violence or injury.
   Gramajo Morales said those involved were fooled by ``speculation
and disinformation'' propagated by civilians, whom he did not
identify.
   Col. Arturo Getella, commander of the Jutiapa base, on Thursday
identified one ringleader as Col. Gustavo Cifuentes, a subcommander
of the same facility.
   The afternoon daily La Hora, citing confidential sources,
identified the uprising's other leaders as Col. Gustavo Adolfo
Padilla, subcommander of the Retalhuleu base, and Manuel Maria
Gordillo Martinez.
   It did not specify Gordillo Martinez's rank or where he was
based.
   The newspaper said Gordillo Martinez is the brother of retired
Col. Francisco Luis Gordillo Martinez, who with Gen. Horacio
Maldonado Schadd and Gen. Efrain Rios Montt formed a military junta
after a coup in March 1982 that overthrew the government of Gen.
Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia.
   Cerezo, a lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party,
won the presidency in November 1985 in the first election in 16
years in which the military did not field a candidate.
   He succeeded Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who seized
power in August 1983 from Rios Montt.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis is criticizing the administration's reported deal
to dismiss charges against Panama's military leader, saying ``I
don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug runners
and murderers.''
   Dukakis was beginning his first full day of West Coast
campaigning today with events across California after stopping
briefly in Portland Thursday night. Tuesday's contest in Oregon is
a prelude to his final round of primaries against Jesse Jackson on
June 7 in California and New Jersey.
   Holding a long lead in delegates going into the final few
primaries, Dukakis continued to focus on the Reagan administration
as he reacted to reports the administration had offered to drop
federal drug-trafficking charges against Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega if he would step down as the country's leader.
   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments and
making deals, the American people deserve a full explanation of
what kind of relationship this administration has had with
Noriega,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug
runners and murderers,'' Dukakis said earlier before arriving in
Oregon.
   Dukakis continued the criticism during his brief stop in
Portland. He also jabbed at Reagan over recent disclosures that the
president's schedule has been guided through the use of astrology
by his wife, Nancy.
   ``Eight months from now, the Reagan era will be over,'' Dukakis
said at a mock political convention by Oregon high school students.
``America will have a new president. We'll be putting away our
horoscopes.''
   As he increasingly turns his criticism on the Republicans and
their expected nominee, Vice President George Bush, Dukakis has
made a common theme of challenging the administration for dealing
quietly with the Panamanian strongman.
   Bush, Democrats contend, should have had knowledge of Noriega
going back to the vice president's days as head of the CIA, and
more recently as head of an administration task force to stop
illegal drug smuggling.
   Noriega and U.S. officials have been negotiating in recent
months to solve the problem posed by his continued position of
power in the face of U.S. indictments alleging deep involvement in
large-scale drug operations.
   Noriega's continuing presence has been regarded as an
embarrassment for the administration and a political problem for
Bush.
   ``The administration got into this soup. It isn't going well,
and it looks to me as if they're desperate to get out of it,''
Dukakis said.
   Dukakis made the comments as he devoted much of the day to
making the rounds of Democratic congressional leaders in Washington
_ sessions in keeping with his role as likely party nominee and
aimed at assuring Capitol Hill Democrats he wants to cooperate.
   In the process he picked up the endorsement of Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd. Dukakis overwhelmingly won this week's
presidential primary in West Virginia, Byrd's home state. He was
also endorsed by House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill.
   Byrd said Dukakis had run a positive campaign that would help
the party unite. He said it was time for Democrats to gather around
the Massachusetts governor as its standard bearer for the fall.
   ``He has not dipped into the trough and gone negative,'' Byrd
said. ``We need to begin to close ranks, and that's what we're
doing today.''
   Dukakis also met with House Speaker Jim Wright, who refused to
answer when asked if he was endorsing the governor. When asked,
Wright responded in Spanish with what amounted to a no comment.
   Dukakis also met with House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.,
who also withheld an endorsement. When asked about Foley as a
running mate, Dukakis smiled and turned to him with the same
question he once put to Jackson when they shared a stage and the
same question arose: ``Are you interested in it?''
   Foley smiled but made no audible reply.

<HEAD>General Electric Selected To Oversee Star Wars Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has become the Pentagon's
prime design contractor for an initial Star Wars missile defense
system, receiving a $235.9 million contract for five years of
research.
   The award, announced Thursday, is one of the largest Star Wars
contracts to date. Under the contract, GE's Aerospace Division in
Philadelphia will oversee research work on the five key
technologies now being considered for a Star Wars system.
   The award capped a five-month competition that pitted GE against
General Dynamics Corp. The competition was limited to companies
that were not working as prime contractors on the five technologies
identified for an initial Star Wars system.
   Both GE and General Dynamics were judged technically competent
to perform the work, but GE had a lower bid, the Pentagon indicated.
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons
that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically
shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the United States or its
allies.
   Last September, then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
selected five technologies for accelerated research, saying they
would form the core of any initial Star Wars system if proven
feasible.
   They consist of two different types of satellite surveillance
and tracking systems; two different ``interception,'' or rocket
weapon, systems; and a battle management-command, control and
communications system _ the computer ``brains'' of any Star Wars
defense.
   GE will be expected to coordinate the work being done on those
five projects. For example, it would set the performance standards
for each component in order to satisfy ``the military requirement
to intercept a certain percentage of targets,'' the Pentagon said.
   GE also will play a particularly crucial role in the work on the
battle management system because it will be asked to ``design the
functions to assist in the selection of algorithms, network
concepts, (computer) processors and software,'' the Pentagon added.
   GE already has assembled a team of subcontractors to assist in
the work and will establish a ``systems engineering and
integration'' office in northern Virginia near the Pentagon, the
Defense Department said.
   The subcontractors include the Science Applications
International Corp. of McLean, Va,.; AT&T Federal Systems Division
in Greensboro, N.C.; the Nichols Research Corp. of Huntsville,
Ala.; the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. of Huntington Beach,
Calif., and the Computer Science Corp.'s Defense Systems Division
in Moorestown, N.J.

   Rep. Floyd Flake of New York says he will
defend himself against a complaint filed with his church that he
sexually harassed a female employee of his congregation before he
was elected to Congress.
   The woman's allegations are being considered by a judiciary
committee of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Buffalo,
N.Y., and a decision could be reached by Sunday, said Flake
spokesman Edwin Reed.
   He said the woman claims that Flake, a first-term New York
Democrat who is also a pastor in the church, fired her from an
administrative assistant job at his 4,000-member Allen A.M.E.
Church in Queens, N.Y., after an affair between the couple ended.
   ``She alleges that they had an affair and when it was over, she
was forced out,'' Reed said in a telephone interview from Buffalo,
where the regional A.M.E. Church is holding its annual meeting.
   Reed said the woman was fired in 1985 before Flake was elected
to Congress, ``but not for those reasons. She was fired because of
her inability to be compatible with the whole staff.''
   Flake was busy at the meeting and not immediately available for
comment, Reed said. But in an interview with The New York Post,
Flake identified the woman as Thelma Singleton-Scott and said she
was trying to blackmail him.
   ``She asked me for money to keep quiet about this,'' said Flake.
``I'm prepared to defend myself against the charges that she
brings.''
   Mrs. Singleton-Scott, who lives in Brooklyn, told The New York
Times Thursday from her Buffalo hotel room that she decided to
disclose the affair only after Flake ``defamed my name and told
church members to stay away from me and removed me from the church
rolls.''
   ``I want him removed from the pulpit,'' she said. ``He committed
adultery.''
   Ms. Singleton-Scott said the affair began shortly after she
started work at the church in 1983 and ended in 1984, according to
the Times.
   The Rev. John Collier, a spokesman for A.M.E. Bishop Frank
Cummings, told the Post that a statement on the allegations will be
issued in a few days.
   Flake, 43, was elected in November 1986. He is married and has
four children.

   The dollar finished the week higher Friday in
dealings against the Japanese yen, while stock prices posted a
strong gain.
   The dollar closed at 124.70 yen, up 0.31 yen from Thursday's
finish. It had opened the day higher at 124.60 yen, and moved
between 124.55 and 124.73 yen.
   Traders said the dollar was moving higher in anticipation of a
slight decline in Japan's trade surplus.
   ``Market participants are also paying attention to U.S. trade
figures for March,'' said a dealer with a major commercial bank,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The U.S. figures are to be
released next Tuesday in Washington.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which won 51.53 points Thursday, gained another
255.73 points, or 0.93 percent, to end the week's session at
27,468.31.
   A brokerage official, who also reguested anonymity, said share
prices rose almost across the board in early trading, as the market
continued on its bullish trend extending over from Thursday.
   The official said a good overnight showing on Wall Street, in
the wake of recent declines, and good results from the refunding
auction of U.S. Treasury bonds in the United States made investors
confident about market prospects.

   The top four floors of a building
under construction collapsed Thursday, burying the basement offices
of a furniture factory. At least 12 people were reported dead and
45 injured.
   Rescue crews used specially-trained search dogs and tunnelling
equipment early Friday to locate survivors trapped under tons of
concrete, said Commander Marco Cerilla, chief of the Aguascalientes
police department.
   He said personnel from the Mexican army, national Red Cross
headquarters and federal Public Security department arrived to
coordinate the search effort.
   Cerilla said police did not know how many people remained buried
under the rubble.
   Esperanza Cardenas, a spokeswoman for the Mexican Red Cross in
Aguascalientes, said early Friday that nine people had been
confirmed dead and 40 injured.
   Juan Manuel Hinojo, a reporter for the Aguascalientes daily El
Heraldo, later told The Associated Press that officials at the site
said there were 12 dead and 45 were rescued, all of who were
injured. He said at least five more people were still unaccounted
for, based on survivors' knowledge of who was in building at the
time.
   Cardenas said authorities did not know how many people had been
in the structure when it collapsed at about 5 p.m. Thursday (7 p.m.
EDT).
   Cardenas said Red Cross workers believed about 40 people had
been rescued alive from the building and all were taken to local
medical facilities because of injuries. Their conditions were not
immediately known.
   ``Exactly how many there are or how many more are inside the
building isn't known,'' she said.
   One of the dead was an unidentified boy about 10 years old,
Cardenas said.
   She said construction workers and employees of the Romo
furniture factory, located in the basement of the building, were in
the building when it plummeted.
   Aguascalientes, capital of Aguascalientes state, is about 320
miles northwest of Mexico City.
   The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.
   Jorge Alberto Castaneda Alvarado, head of the Aguascalientes
Civil Engineers Association, announced early Friday the formation
of a committee of engineers and architects to investigate the
collapse.

<TEXT>
   Broadway, the street of sleaze and
striptease that has carried on the city's bawdiest Barbary Coast
traditions, has become the target of shopkeepers and cultural
groups who want to peel away its seedy image.
   Several new restaurants are scheduled to open and a restored
theater plans to offer chamber music, dance and opera alongside the
blinking neon lights of the avenue's notorious topless clubs.
   Restaurateur Enrico Banducci, who watched the swing era crowd,
the beatniks and the hippies pass through in his four decades on
Broadway, remembers when the North Beach district street was lined
with thriving cafes and nightclubs.
   ``There was a great feeling and great smells on the street,''
recalled Banducci, 66. ``Now you just smell the street, and that
isn't very nice.''
   But Walter Pastore of the North Beach Chamber of Commerce says
merchants are now ``showing that Broadway is on an upswing. We have
many, many new businesses coming into the area and investing
hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars.
   ``It's an important area for the city, and people are trying to
bring it back to life,'' he said Thursday.
   The city's North Beach area was the 19th century waterfront,
known as the Barbary Coast, a place to go for whiskey during
Prohibition, and a one-time beatnik neighborhood. San Franciscans
and tourists still love it for its history and its remaining
bookstores, coffee houses and Italian bakeries.
   In 1964, Broadway, which runs through North Beach, gained
national notoriety when several clubs announced they would offer
topless dancing. Two years later, they turned the idea upside down
and introduced bottomless dancing.
   For several years, the clubs and sex shops on the now-gaudy
street flourished, drawing curious tourists with neon signs and
barkers.
   But eventually the novelty of nudity wore off, and fewer
tourists visited Broadway.
   ``At one time this was all new,'' said a barker outside the
hungry i, who calls himself Rocky Raccoon.
   ``Now you can go to someone's backyard and see topless dancing.
People don't have to come to San Francisco anymore, that's why the
clubs are dying,'' he said.
   Raccoon, 36, one of the few barkers left on Broadway, stood
quietly in front of the club that offers a ``Live Exotic Strip
Revue.''
   More aggressive barkers, along with shops displaying sex
gadgets, is the main reason for Broadway's decline in the 1980s,
Banducci believes.
   ``People just would not walk down this street because of barkers
reaching out, grabbing at them and yelling at them. We all suffered
from it,'' he said.
   In recent years, several topless clubs have closed, and the
strip has been plagued by vandalism, teen-age rowdies and
competition from new, chic nightclubs in the South of Market Street
area.
   The remaining topless clubs probably are threatened by the new
restaurants and theaters moving into the area, said Marsha Garland
of the chamber of commerce.
   ``It's an old idea. You can't keep the format going for 30
years,'' she said. ``As leases turn over, I think you'll see other
businesses taking their place.''
   But Banducci doesn't think so.
   ``I think we can all exist and get along fine. I think we can
coexist beautifully,'' he said.
   ``Everyone is concerned about Broadway. ... But to `clean it up'
entirely is a misnomer. You can't do that,'' he said. ``It's a fun
street, it's been a fun street for the last 150 years.''

   The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo today, while stock prices rose substantially following
an overnight rally on Wall Street.
   After opening the day at 124.60 yen, up 0.21 yen from Thursday's
finish, the dollar edged up slightly to end the week's trading at
124.70 yen, up 0.31 yen.
   ``The dollar was already high at the start of trading, following
its firm finish on overseas markets,'' said a dealer at a major
commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was some speculative dollar-buying prompted by the
announcement that Japan's trade surplus for April had decreased for
the 12th-consecutive month, but the market was relatively quiet and
the dollar moved in a narrow range of 124.55-124.73 yen, he said.
   Japan posted a trade surplus of $6.746 billion in April, falling
from $7.535 billion a year earlier and $7.459 billion in the
previous month, the Finance Ministry said today.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 51.53 points Thursday, gained another
255.73 points, or 0.93 percent, in active trading to close the week
at 27,468.31.
   Share prices rose almost across the board during early trading,
helped by an overnight rally on Wall Street and news reports
indicating a success in Thursday's refunding auction of 30-year
bonds by the U.S. Treasury, traders said.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported today that Japan bought about half
the bonds auctioned in the United States late Thursday.
   ``Investors were also encouraged by the market strength shown
Thursday, when it bounced back promptly from an early plunge of
about 200 points,'' said a brokerage official, who spoke
anonymously.
   Popular issues included machineries, steels and electricals.
Automobiles, constructions and housings were also higher. Among the
losers were some foodstuffs.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion shares,
up from 900 million shares Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The House Intelligence Committee has approved
a bill that would require the president to notify Congress within
48 hours when he authorizes any covert action by U.S. agencies and
officials.
   The legislation was prompted by the recommendations of the
congressional panels that investigated the Iran-Contra affair when
it was revealed that Congress had not been informed until 10 months
after President Reagan had approved a secret arms-for-hostages swap.
   The committee annnounced Thursday that it had approved the
legislation by an 11-to-6 party-line vote.
   It is similar to a covert-action measure passed March 15 by the
Senate on a vote of 71 to 19.
   Under the current bill, a covert action is any U.S. activity,
other than traditional military, diplomatic and law enforcement
actions, designed ``to influence political, economic or military
conditions abroad so that the role of the United States government
is not intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly...''
   The bill, which requires the president to give prior written
notice of any but emergency covert action, now goes to the full
House for a vote.

<HEAD>House Votes To Make Itself More Immune To Civil Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has unanimously approved a
resolution to help protect its members from civil lawsuits in
connection with news releases, new conferences and communication
between government officials.
   The 413-0 vote on Thursday was triggered by a federal appeals
court decision that limited lawmakers' immunity to activities such
as speaking and voting on the House or Senate floor as granted by
the Constitution's speech and debate clause.
   The resolution asks that the Supreme Court hear an appeal of the
case to consider a broader interpretation of immunity.
   The court made its decision in a case involving Rep. Don
Sundquist, R-Tenn. and the Menphis Area Legal Services Corp.
   Sundquist made a reference to a staff attorney letters he wrote
to the attorney general and the president of the corporation about
a controversy regarding expenditure of federal money by the office.
   Sundquist later released the letter to the news media and the
attorney sued for defamation of character.
   The case originally was dismissed in U.S. district court but
that ruling was reversed by the appeals court. Sundquist then
appealed to the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   A House appropriations subcommittee has cut
more than $780 million out of the NASA budget and agency officials
said the reduction could seriously affect the civil space program.
   The Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on housing and urban
development and independent agencies approved a total budget for
the space agency for fiscal year 1989 of $10.706 billion. NASA had
asked for $11.488 billion.
   One of the largest cuts came in NASA's request for the
struggling space shuttle program. It was reduced by more than $200
million.
   ``Something will have to be cut. There's nothing left. If they
do make these cuts, some serious things will happen to the civil
space program,'' said shuttle astronaut Jon McBride.
   The space shuttle has been grounded since January 1986 when the
explosion of the Challenger shuttle killed seven crew members. The
winged spacecraft fleet is scheduled to resume flights in August.

   A congressional study says the Near East and

   The Congressional Research Service report, released Thursday,

major arms suppliers to the Third World.
   France, Britain and China rounded off the top five arms
merchants to the Third World. The 70-page study by defense analyst
Richard F. Grimmett said the Beijing government committed 79
percent of its arms exports to Iran and Iraq from 1984 to 1987, the
period covered by the report.
   The rest of the list of the top 11 are Italy, West Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Spain, Brazil and South Korea.

   A former school superintendent who has AIDS was
scheduled as the keynote speaker tonight at a major conference on
how to stop the spread of the fatal disease among school-age youth.
   ``I know there will be no cure for AIDS in my lifetime,'' John
W. Washburn Jr., 48, said in pre-conference remarks released
Thursday. `The only vaccine we have now is education.''
   Public health officials and more than 100 educators from across
the country were expected to attend the three-day conference
sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the National
Education Association.
   The conference is part of what NEA President Mary Hatwood
Futrell has called the teacher group's ``all-out war against AIDS.''
   Washburn, the retired superintendent of the Brighton School
District near Rochester, N.Y., was diagnosed as having AIDS last
spring. He revealed his illness in January, when he embarked on a
series of speeches.
   Conference organizers said Washburn would talk tonight about his
experiences as a person with AIDS and efforts to educate students
and teachers about the disease.
   Other scheduled conference participants include Dr. Gary Noble,
CDC deputy director for AIDS, and other officials and researchers
with the Atlanta-based health agency.
   The NEA and the CDC's parent agency, the Public Health Service,
are members of the Health Information Network, created last year as
part of the AIDS education effort. Last fall, the network
distributed 1.9 million copies of ``Facts About AIDS,'' a handbook
for teachers.
   AIDS has struck 973 U.S. children under 13; 566 have died,
according to the CDC. In all, AIDS has struck more than 61,000
people in the United States, killing more than 34,000 of them so
far.

   A 450-pound Siberian tiger that smashed through a
reinforced window at the Houston Zoo and killed a zookeeper poses
no threat to visitors and won't be destroyed, officials say.
   ``We can contain that cat,'' zoo director John Werler said
Thursday following zookeeper Ricardo Tovar's death, the first of
its kind at the zoo.
   The big cat apparently broke through a 2{-foot-square,
quarter-inch-thick glass-and-wire mesh window in a door, then
dragged Tovar, 59, into its natural habitat area and mauled him to
death, Werler said.
   Tovar, a 10-year zoo employee, had apparently been peering
through the window from a hallway. There were no witnesses to the
attack, and it was unclear how long it had gone undiscovered.
Tovar's shift began at 6 a.m.
   John Gilbert, senior zookeeper of cats, said he realized that
something was wrong around 7:45 a.m. when he called to Tovar ``and
the tiger reared up and put his face into the door.'' He radioed
for help.
   A response team headed by Curator of Exhibits Tom Dieckow
arrived five minutes later.
   Dieckow said he fired a shot from his rifle, which made the
animal drop Tovar. He fired two more shots in an effort to scare
the 11-year-old cat away from the zookeeper's body.
   Workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage
with a fire extinguisher, Dieckow said.
   ``It cut him (Tovar) up and ate him up pretty good,'' Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw said, adding that much of Tovar's
left arm was torn away. ``He had numerous bites about him and
possibly a broken neck.''
   The tiger, named Miguel, will not be destroyed because it is a
member of an endangered species, Werler said.
   Werler said the animal is aggressive. ``It snarls and growls and
we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions,'' he
said.
   Tovar had been in charge of large cats since 1985.
   ``He was very competent. He knew his job,'' said Nelson Herwig,
a friend of Tovar and curator of the zoo aquarium for 10 years.
   The tiger display, which houses two other Siberian tigers, was
closed to the public Thursday.
   Visitors, including hundreds of school children, were delayed
entrance into the zoo by 30 minutes.
   ``Lots of parents have been calling, saying their children are
at the zoo with their school and want to make sure everything is
all right,'' said Cathy Kuntz, a zoo secretary.
   Werler said the tiger posed no threat to the public because it
would have to get through three doors to reach visitors.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers. It
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

   ``Carrie'' is not quite bad enough to be good.
   This trashy, high-tech pop musical version of Stephen King's
horror novel, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Virginia Theater,
vacillates between seriousness and schlock.
   Eventually it settles for schlock, but only after trying to make
something important out of King's blood-drenched drama of a
demented, ultra-religious mother and her disturbed, telekinetic
daughter. Its high-flying intentions crash.
   King's novel is a story of teen-age vindictiveness and revenge,
but it had a clinical, hard-edged quality that escapes the musical.
This show would need the lunacy of a Charles Ludlum to cut through
King's hooey and pyschobabble.
   What it gets from director Terry Hands is a sobriety that is
often unintentionally funny and a cold, glittering production full
of stark white scenery, laser beams, hydraulic lifts and enough
fake blood to fill the Red Sea. Surprisingly, the special effects
are rather tame.
   Carrie gets to tele-transport a few small objects like a
hairbrush and a pair of shoes, but there's nothing to suggest the
orgy of destruction she conjures up for the musical's finale.
   The story, sketchily adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen, is a
Cinderella tale gone sour. Bovine little Carrie White is humiliated
at the ball _ in this case a high school prom _ and turns everybody
else into a pumpkin with deadly results.
   The girl has been tormented by her female classmates, the
oldest-looking high school students this side of Betty and
Veronica. They make fun of her innocence, particularly when she has
her first menstrual flow during gym class and believes she is dying.
   Carrie's mother is not too keen on her daughter's sexual
awakening either, believing it to be a curse for her own loveless
marriage. She keeps urging her daughter to get down and pray. They
spend a lot of the evening on their knees.
   Mother and daughter get into a big confrontation after Carrie is
invited to the prom by Tommy, the school's most popular boy. Tommy
has been put up to this good deed by his girlfriend Sue, who has
been feeling guilty about the way she treated Carrie.
   That's not the case with Chris, the meanest girl in town. She
plots with her boyfriend to dump a bucket of pig's blood on Carrie
during the prom. That's the occasion for something called ``Out for
Blood,'' which may be the only dance number in Broadway musical
history that mimes the slaughtering of a pig.
   The dances are the work of Debbie Allen, Broadway's last Sweet
Charity and a star of the television series ``Fame.'' Her
choreography is more aerobic than inspired, but then the music she
is given to work with doesn't exactly move. Michael Gore's melodies
are soft rock, soft to the point of mush, while the lyrics by Dean
Pitchford, when they can be understood, celebrate the simple-minded.
   What gives ``Carrie'' its occasional moments of conviction are
the performances of Betty Buckley and an appealing 17-year-old
named Linzi Hateley who plays the title role. The girl sings her
heart out. Miss Hateley has a warm, strong voice and acts with an
authority that belies her experience.
   Buckley, as that monster of a mother, matches the young
performer's singing note for note. The best part of the show is
their opening duet, entitled ``Open Your Heart.'' You believe them.
   After the two leading ladies, the quality of the cast collapses.
Former pop star Darlene Love is wasted as the sympathetic gym
teacher who befriends Carrie, Paul Gyngell personifies blandness as
the girl's would-be Prince Charming and Charlotte D'Amboise's
villainous Chris borders on parody.
   The settings by Ralph Koltai are of the Cecil B. DeMille school,
big but not necessarily better, particularly a giant white
staircase that materializes for the play's last scene. Alexander
Reid's costumes, fit for an outer space version of ``Grease,'' are
remarkably unflattering, particularly for the women.
   But the lighting, done by director Hands, is startling _ simple,
direct and effective.
   That's something the musical isn't. For a horror story, the show
gets more giggles than screams and can't touch such Grand Guignol
as Stephen Sondheim's ``Sweeney Todd,'' the ultimate in unnerving
song and dance.
   ``Carrie'' comes to Broadway courtesy of the Royal Shakespeare
Company which tried out the show at its home in Stratford, England,
before coming to New York. The cast is half American and half
British, a mixture that required special approval from the actors
unions in both countries. Maybe next time they will insist on a
better show.
   Other reviews:
   Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote that the film version of
``Carrie'' was ``scary, funny and sexy pulp entertainment'' because
it portrayed the material's ``thrills, wit and post-pubescent
sensuality'' well.
   ``The musical `Carrie' fails in all these areas,'' he concluded.
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News wrote that the show ``makes no
more sense than 2{ hours of MTV, which, of course, is what it looks
like.''
   He called the show ``disgusting'' and added: ``There is enough
gratuitous vulgarity in `Carrie' that I wouldn't send a child.''
   But in the New York Post, Clive Barnes called the show ``a
strong, effective and remarkably coherent piece of terrific total
theater. ... a schematic morality play, replete with the forces of
good and evil, to say nothing of a cathartic finale of biblical
proportions.''

<HEAD>Discovery Of Second Genetic Code Surprises Researchers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The unraveling of a second genetic code
essential to producing the chemicals of life is important because
it provides a striking example of nature's logic, says a researcher
who helped decipher the code that baffled scientists for two
decades.
   ``It looks like an elegantly simple logic that's remained
obscure for all these years, but I think we're finally getting a
handle on it,'' said Paul Schimmel, a biochemist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``It's a spectacular example of biological logic, or the logical
system that nature uses,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   While the practical applications are remote, the breakthrough
represents a major step in providing scientists with new forms of
genetic engineering. In addition, they expect to identify some
inherited disorders caused by mistakes in the second code.
   Schimmel reported taking the first step toward deciphering the
code, which governs the the final assembly of proteins in cells.
His findings were described Thursday in Nature, a British
scientific journal.
   Alexander Rich, an MIT biologist unconnected with the research,
said, ``The important thing in Schimmel's discovery is that the
results are strikingly simple.'' Most researchers would have
guessed that a more complex code was needed, he said.
   The original genetic code was deciphered in 1961. Researchers
found that the sequence of distinct chemical subunits in the
genetic material DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) determined which
protein would be made by that gene.
   Change the DNA sequence, and you'd change the protein _ by
changing its sequence of chemical subunits.
   DNA doesn't make proteins directly, however. It hands off its
instructions to a chemical called messenger RNA, which in turn
passes the information to a third chemical called transfer RNA.
   The transfer RNA then uses the second genetic code to actually
assemble proteins from their amino acid building blocks.
   The discovery of the original genetic code led to the field of
genetic engineering, in which scientists alter the genetic material
of cells in order to create proteins, such as those used as
medicines.
   Researchers had searched for the key to the second code since
the first one was deciphered, and many abandoned their efforts
after repeated failures.
   Schimmel and his MIT colleague, Ya-Ming Hou, broke the code for
the amino acid called alanine. (Each molecule of transfer RNA is
coded for one of the 20 amino acids.)
   The DNA and RNA molecules are made up of subunits called base
pairs. The MIT researchers found, to their surprise, that the code
for alanine was carried in a single base pair on the alanine
transfer RNA molecule.
   It should now be a straightforward process to decipher the
transfer RNA codes for the remaining 19 amino acids, Schimmel said.
   Minor errors in this second genetic code might give rise to
disease, Schimmel said. Deciphering the code could help doctors
understand and possibly treat such diseases, he said.
   ``Any errors in this system, if they occur to a significant
extent, are lethal,'' Schimmel said. ``The proteins would all be
scrambled.''
   The importance of the finding lies primarily in its elucidation
of a long-standing biological mystery, however, not in any
short-term practical applications, he said.

   Angry friends and relatives gathered to
remember the 11 people who died three years ago today after a
police helicopter bombed the house of the radical group MOVE,
sparking a fire that engulfed a city block.
   ``What we have seen is the worst that we can see in mankind,''
said Andino Ward, the father of one of two survivors from the
house, Michael Moses Ward, 16.
   Ward was among 100 people Thursday at the Tindley Temple United
Methodist Church, where the mood was tinged with sorrow but marked
more by anger and resentment over what some see as inaction in
addressing the conduct of city officials during the May 13, 1985,
confrontation.
   Events scheduled to mark the anniversary include a candlelight
ceremony today at 5:27 p.m., the exact time of the bombing, panel
discussions and a public forum on Saturday.
   Ward told the group to make sure their children ``keep forever
in their hearts the doctrine of the preservation of human life.''
   Ward's former wife, Rhonda, died in the house, which was
destroyed by fire along with 60 other homes after police dropped a
bomb on the MOVE headquarters in an effort to end the confrontation
with the radical group.
   The battle began when police went to the MOVE house in search of
four people named in arrest warrants. Firefighters aimed their
water cannons at a bunker MOVE members had built on their roof, and
police fired tear gas.
   After gunshots were fired at police from inside the MOVE house,
a satchel containing explosives was dropped from a helicopter onto
the roof in an attempt to destroy the bunker.
   A grand jury that investigated the confrontation for two years
released a report last week blasting city officials for ``morally
reprehensible behavior.'' However, no criminal charges were
recommended.
   Louise James, whose brother and son died in the MOVE house, told
those gathered Thursday that a commitment to prevent similar
tragedies was ``meaningless'' without action to punish those in
charge during the standoff.
   ``Future resolution without present accountability is as
undigestible to me and my family as the murder of 11 innocent
lives,'' said Mrs. James, sister of MOVE founder John Africa.
   ``There is something very wrong here and until steps are taken
to correct it, we cannot move on,'' Mrs. James said, to applause
and words of encouragement from several in the crowd.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other
Iranian leaders cast their votes in Tehran today in the second and
final round of balloting in parliamentary elections, Iran's
official news agency reported.
   Khomeini voted in a mobile polling booth outside his heavily
guarded residence in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran an hour
after voting began at 7 a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT Thursday), the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   The report came as rumors swept the Hong Kong stock market that
Khomeini, 87 and reported to have been in poor health for some
time, had died.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, gave no indication of Khomeini's
physical appearance when he cast his ballot.
   The first round of voting April 8, in which Khomeini also
participated, elected 188 of the 270 deputies in the Majlis, or
Parliament.
   At stake in today's run-off are the other 82 electoral
districts, including 16 of the 30 in Tehran. Polls close at 5 p.m.
(9:30 a.m. EDT).
   IRNA gave no indication of how many of Iran's estimated 22
million-strong electorate were involved in today's voting and did
not mention turnout.
   But it said that Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
polled more than 1.3 million votes in the April 8 round,
Prosecutor-General Hojatoleslam Mohammad Musavi Khoeiniha and
officials from Khomeini's office cast their votes in Jamaran after
the aging revolutionary patriarch.
   President Ali Khamenei and Prime Minister Hussein Musavi voted
in south Tehran mosques, which were being used as polling stations,
IRNA said.
   They later joined marches in the capital to mark Qods, or
Jerusalem, Day, held on the last Friday of the holy Moslem fasting
month of Ramadan.
   This was the third parliamentary election since Khomeini's
Islamic revolution toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in
1979.
   April's balloting was held amid Iraqi missile and air attacks on
Iranian cities. Both sides in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war have
observed a truce in the so-called ``war of the cities'' since April
21.
   Major military setbacks in recent weeks have increased tensions
in Iran.
   Among those setbacks were the loss of the Faw peninsula in
southern Iraq, recaptured by the Iraqis April 18 after a 26-month
Iranian occupation, and naval clashes in the gulf the same day in
which the U.S. Navy sank or crippled six Iranian vessels.
   In the aftermath of those defeats, radicals and Moslem
extremists were expected to widen the seizeable gains they made in
the first round of voting. Several leading conservatives lost their
seats then.
   But the main election issues have been economic and social
reform.
   The composition of the new Majlis, which will sit for four
years, will have considerable influence on the direction that the
Islamic revolution will take and on who will succeed Khomeini.
   The radicals seek centralized state control of the economy and
broadening of reforms.
   The conservatives, including fundamentalist clerics, are
supported by the ``Bazaaris,'' the weathy merchant class that has
survived the revolution and believes in a capitalist system.
   ``The conservatives have lost out rather badly,'' noted Philip
Robbins, an Iran specialist with the Royal Institute of
International affairs in London.
   ``The new Majlis looks like being a far more radical body than
it was before, particularly on the important issue of economic
policy,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful figure in Iran after
Khomeini, appears to be one of the bigger winners in the election.
   He supports major reforms that have long been blocked by the
conservative-dominated Council of Guardians, a watchdog body that
has the power to veto Majlis legislation considered to violate
Islamic tenets.
   ``The radicals will bolster Rafsanjani's position
considerably,'' Robbins noted.
   Khomeini, who also favors economic reforms and wants to see the
revolution set on a firm course before he dies, gave the radicals a
big boost before the April voting.
   He delivered a series of edicts widening state powers that
opened the way for reformist legislation vetoed by the 13-member
Council of Guardians.
   The radicals got another shot in the arms Thursday, when Tehran
Radio rebroadcast an announcement Khomeini made before the April 8
poll.
   ``People must vote for the best candidates, those who have
tasted the sour taste of poverty and misery; those who are the true
representatives of the poor and deprived of the world, not those
who represent the Islam of the rich, the capitalists, the arrogant,
the opportunists. I mean the Islam of the Americans,'' he said.
   Although the Majlis does not control Iran's war strategy, which
is determined by the Supreme Defense Council, the radicals' growing
political power could have a significant influence in that regard.

<HEAD>Book Calls Reagan Highly Intelligent But Passive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book by a former Reagan aide
describes the president as ``highly intelligent, with a
photographic memory,'' but it also characterizes him as a passive
president who governs like a ``Turkish pasha.''
   ``Ronald Reagan ... had one distinctive personality trait that
was highly unusual, perhaps unique for someone who rose to the high
level of managerial responsibility he attained,'' writes Martin
Anderson, former assistant to the president for policy development.
``He made no demands and gave almost no instructions.
   Anderson's book, ``Revolution,'' is scheduled to be published
May 18. Some advance copies have been distributed.
   The book is generally laudatory of Reagan's presidency, but it
tends to confirm other books, most recently one written by former
Chief of Staff Donald Regan, that describe Reagan as passive.
   ``Essentially, he just responded to whatever was brought to his
attention and said yes or no, or `I'll think about it.' At times he
would just change the subject, (and) maybe tell a funny story,''
writes Anderson, now a senior fellow at Stanford University's
Hoover Institute.
   ``It was something that all those who had worked closely and
intimately with Ronald Reagan knew. But we rarely talked about it
among ourselves and never to outsiders. We kept it a secret.
   ``He is highly intelligent, with a photographic memory,'' says
Anderson, ``He has a gift for absorbing great amounts of diverse
information and is capable of combining various parts of that
information into new, coherent packages and then conveying his
thoughts and ideas clearly and concisely in a way that is
understandable to almost anyone.''
   But Anderson says Reagan made decisions ``like an ancient king
or a Turkish pasha, passively letting his subjects serve him.
Rarely did he ask searching questions and demand to know why
someone had or had not done something.''
   The president was ``very dependent'' on his advisers, Anderson
says. ``And the degree to which he trusted and depended on his
advisers is probably the key to understanding the Iran-Contra
affair that crippled Reagan's presidency.''
   Anderson describes Nancy Reagan as ``highly intelligent, with a
sixth sense for asking insightful, penetrating questions. Above
all, her judgments on public policy issues, political strategy and
personnel were superb,'' he says.
   The book makes no mention of Regan's account that the first lady
consulted with an astrologer on her husband's schedule and other
issues.

<HEAD>Juror Admits Involvement in Own Contaminated Product Incident</HEAD>

   A member of the jury that convicted a woman in
the nation's first death-by-product-tampering case has admitted
that she was involved in an earlier product contamination case she
filed against a cracker company.
   Juror Laurel Holliday, who had been the lone holdout for
acquittal until changing her mind on the panel's last vote Monday,
also told the court that she received an anonymous phone call last
week telling her that Stella Nickell failed an FBI polygraph exam.
The information was inadmissible during the trial.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer ordered the seven-woman,
five-man jury to return to court today for questioning about
whether they were improperly influenced.
   Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn, was convicted of killing her
husband and a woman with cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Excedrin
capsules in June 1986. She faces possible life imprisonment at a
June 17 sentencing.
   Ms. Holliday, who was retained on the jury with the consent of
defense lawyer Thomas Hillier II, said neither the phone call nor
her previous experience with product contamination influenced her
decision to vote for conviction. She said she was eventually swayed
by what she called a series of discrepancies in Mrs. Nickell's
testimony.
   Dwyer and Hillier declined comment Thursday on the new
disclosures in the case.
   After the verdict, when it became known Ms. Holliday had been
the lone holdout for acquittal, Hillier raised the issue of
possible jury tampering and suggested another juror might have
influenced Ms. Holliday or that she ``contrived'' the anonymous
call to avoid the pressure of being the holdout vote.
   Ms. Holliday denied making the call herself and said she doubted
any other juror would have made it either.
   Court records show Ms. Holliday settled a lawsuit for $500
against Pepperidge Farm Inc. She had said she bit into a Goldfish
cracker that contained an aspirin substitute, ibuprofen.
   There were no witnesses and Pepperidge Farm attorneys questioned
whether the event ever took place.
   Ms. Holliday said she didn't think her lawsuit was important and
``had no bearing on'' the cyanide case, so she didn't reveal it to
the judge or lawyers involved in picking jurors for the cyanide
trial.
   ``I thought it didn't apply,'' she said. ``He (the judge) asked
about product tampering. ... There was no reason to bring it up.''
   She said she regarded the cracker incident as a manufacturing
mishap and said there was no suggestion that it involved product
tampering.
   The episode occurred in July 1986, a month after the two cyanide
deaths.

   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms swept through Alabama
and northern Florida today after large chunks of hail pelted
portions of Louisiana and high winds ripped down power lines in
Arkansas.
   Showers and thunderstorms eased over the Pacific Northwest early
this morning. Strong thunderstorms developing late Thursday night
along a cold front crossing Washington and Oregon produced strong
and gusty winds. The Pendleton, Ore., and Yakima, Wash., airports
recorded winds that whipped up to 60 mph.
   Thunderstorms over the lower Mississippi Valley on Thursday
night produced one-inch-sized hail, while hail as big as golf balls
lashed an area near Spearsville, La. In Norphlet, Ark., high winds
downed power lines.
   Meanwhile, scattered showers that extended from Lake Michigan to
southern Iowa early this morning were developing ahead of a cold
front that was rapidly moving across the upper Midwest.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with fair
skies in most areas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Ohio Valley into New England, with most from the eastern Great
Lakes region through New York into Vermont; rain over the northern
Pacific Coast region; and mostly sunny over the rest of the country.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s over much of
the nation; in the 60s along the northern half of the Pacific Coast
region into much of Washington, and from the upper Mississippi
Valley into the lower Great Lakes region; in the 50s across the
upper Great Lakes; in the 90s over Oklahoma and the inland areas of
southern Texas; and in the upper 90s and nearing 110 over the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 88 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Top Contra Official Denies Reports Of Mutiny Among Contra Fighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan rebels' chief
spokesman dismissed reports of a mutiny in the ranks and said the
leadership was seeking proof of allegations of corruption against
their top military leader.
   Bosco Matamoros said Thursday night that dissidents demanding
the removal of military commander Enrique Bermudez are fewer than
the 726 rebel fighters at a base camp near the Nicaraguan border.
   He would not give a more specific estimate. There have been
reports 2,000 rebels were engaged in a mutiny at the camp in
Yamales, a Honduran town 20 miles north of the Nicaraguan border.
   ``There is not a climate of confrontation there,'' Matamoros
said in an interview. ``They have a legitimate right to differences
of opinions.
   ``But from that, to conclude that the organization is at a
breaking point ... would be to ignore the fact that this
organization has 17,000 men.''
   Independent estimates have put rebel strength at half that
number.
   Bermudez and two civilian leaders of the Contras, as the
U.S.-supported rebels are known, met in Yamales this week with some
of the combatants who have accused him of corruption and
inefficiency.
   Honduran authorities barred journalists from traveling to the
camp.
   Matamoros, who said he also visited the camp, disputed claims by
some Contra sources that 4,000 rebels troops were there.
   ``That's one of the most fantastic things I've heard,'' he said,
contending that 4,000 combatants were strung along the entire
Honduran-Nicaraguan border.
   The dissent attracted attention last week when Honduras deported
seven Contras field commanders to the United States.
   Matamoros said the seven had publicly discussed rebel issues, a
sensitive point for Honduras, which for years has barely
acknowledged the existence since 1981 of Contra base camps on its
soil.
   A dissident field commander who was not deported, Diogenes
Hernandez Membreno, fled to Yamales.
   Matamoros said he was briefly detained along the road to the
camp Sunday by some of Hernandez Membreno's men, who he said number
about 200.
   The spokesman said grumblings about Bermudez surfaced last month
and the Contras' military directors sent a letter April 20
requesting a meeting to discuss the allegations.
   Matamoros said that three dissident field commanders including
Hernandez Membreno had responded in an April 26 letter but had not
produced material proof of their accusations that Bermudez was
corrupt and inefficient.
   He said the Contras' 27-member council of regional commanders
would investigate the charges and decide whether disciplinary
action is warranted. Bermudez could only be removed by the Contras'
civilian leadership.
   Matamoros dismissed claims Bermudez opposes forging a lasting
peace with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   He said Bermudez, while at Yamales on Wednesday, told the troops
he ``fully endorsed the process of negotiations'' with the
Sandinistas to try to end the 6{-year-old war.
   Bermudez, 46, was Nicaragua's representative to the
Inter-American Defense Board in Washington, D.C., under President
Anastasio Somoza, the rightist dictator overthrown by the
Sandinistas in 1979.
   On March 23, Sandinista and Contra leaders signed a preliminary
peace accord. A 60-day truce took effect April 1, during which the
two sides were supposed to negotiate conditions for a permanent
peace that would give the Contras a role in the political process.
   Two rounds of high-level negotiations in Managua since have
failed to produce substantial progress. Foremost among issues
dividing the two sides are how to guarantee security for the
Contras once they move into designated cease-fire zones in
Nicaragua.
   The date for the next round of talks has not been set.

<TEXT>
   A pregnant 17-year-old senior was crowned
May Day queen of her high school, but she and 45 other students
were suspended from classes today for protesting limits placed on
her royal duties.
   ``I know there are people out there tonight who feel strongly
against me being up here, and I never thought such a big issue
would be raised about it,'' AnnaMaria DeVries said at her
coronation Thursday night.
   ``Some people are saying that I have no morals, but those people
don't realize I could have taken an easier way out,'' she added.
   The Dayton Junior-Senior High School's student body elected
DeVries queen last month. DeVries, who is single and nearly six
months pregnant, says she plans to marry and keep the baby.
   There were no protests at the ceremony in the school gymnasium
in this farming town of 1,470.
   ``Everything went very well,'' principal Tom Gallagher said.
``She gave a very classy speech.''
   Earlier Thursday, school officials suspended 45 students who
protested limits placed on DeVries' reign because of her pregnancy.
   The May Day queen traditionally visits Dayton Grade School the
day after her coronation. But after receiving complaints this year,
Gallagher canceled the visit.
   ``We got quite a few phone calls from local patrons, parents,
ministers, whatever, just a gamut of different people from the
community that were upset that the school would allow a pregnant
young lady to be elected,'' Gallagher said.
   Parents of grade school students were worried that DeVries'
pregnancy could cause problems by forcing them to answer questions
from children who see her at the grade school's May Day event, he
said.
   ``My stance was, does the grade school need to be put in that
position?'' he said. ``That's their May Day, their fun day. It
could have put a damper on their celebration.''
   Friends of DeVries asked the school board Monday to overturn
Gallagher's decision, but the board unanimously supported the
principal.
   About 75 students from the 330-student high school responded
Wednesday with a campus sit-in that ended when many of the
protesters, including DeVries, left the campus without permission
for a march through town, Gallagher said. Those students were
suspended for one day, effective today.
   DeVries, an honors student who played on the school's softball
and girls' basketball teams, said she initially went along with
Gallagher's decision but changed her mind after talking it over
with friends.
   ``The decision really didn't surprise me. I had already heard
about the complaining,'' she said.
   Matt Yaskovic, a senior and organizer of the protest, said the
school was setting a poor example.
   ``They tell us all the time you're adults and have to act like
one, and they get us with all these kiddy rules,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Europe, Gold Fractionally Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was steady in early European
trading today with dealers predicting little major movement before
next Tuesday's release of U.S. trade figures for March. Gold prices
were fractionally lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the volume of dollar trading was
very low because many European traders decided to turn Thursday's
Ascencion Day holiday into a four-day weekend.
   Traders expect the March trade deficit to range from $12.5
billion to $13.5 billion. The U.S. trade gap stood at $13.8 billion
in February.
   ``You'd need a deficit at least as low as $12 billion to inspire
any positive move to the dollar,'' said one Milan trader.
   Traders said they didn't attach much importance to today's
report that Japan's trade surplus with the United States shrank to
$4.125 billion in April from $5.129 billion in April 1987.
   ``The (U.S.) deficit with Japan may have improved, but it could
well have worsened with other strong Asian economies like Taiwan or
(South) Korea,'' the Milan trader said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.31 yen to a closing 124.70. Later, in London, it fell
back to 124.52 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates:
   _1.6823 West German marks, up from 1.6813
   _1.3968 Swiss francs, down from 1.3987
   _5.7043 French francs, up from 5.7020
   _1.8864 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8850
   _1,252.75 Italian lire, up from 1,250.50
   _1.2315 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2298
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.8850 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.8823 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $450.20 a troy ounce,
down from $451.50 late Thursday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $451.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $451. The Zurich market was closed
Thursday for Ascencion Day.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.61 to close at a bid $451.67.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.56 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Two Transit Police Officers Charged With False Arrests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have charged two transit
police officers with falsely arresting six men on sexual abuse
charges in subways in an apparent attempt by the officers to
improve their arrest records.
   Officers Mary McDermott, 31, and Alphonse Iannacone, 41, were
charged Thursday with five counts of conspiring to violate the
civil rights of citizens, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said.
   The cases of seven other transit officers who also had high
numbers of questionable arrests during the same time period are
under investigation, Giuliani said at a news conference.
   The two officers charged had arrested six black and Hispanic men
in 1983 and 1984 on charges they lewdly rubbed themselves against
women in the subway. However, the ``victims,'' who were mostly
white women, told the officers they were not aware of the men's
actions and were not interested in pressing charges.
   Nevertheless, the officers allegedly filed false statements,
indicating the women ``were victims who could identify the suspects
and were willing to press charges,'' Giuliani said. ``Not only were
the charges not supported, but there was a substantial allegation
they were trumped up.''
   However, William McKechnie, president of the Transit Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, said he believed that if the officers are
indicted, ``we are sure that they will be vindicated by a jury of
their peers.''
   McDermott and Iannacone, who were suspended without pay after
their arrest, face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine on each of the five counts.
   A 1984 Transit Police Department report alleged widespread
improprieties by McDermott, Iannacone and two other transit
officers.
   The report, prepared by Lt. Thomas Dargan, said the managements
of the Transit Authority and the transit police shared some of the
blame, because the officers were motivated by a system that gave
better assignments to those making the most arrests.
   ``I feel sad for the officers,'' Dargan said in a telephone
interview Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The only remaining U.S. manufacturer of a
crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production
until it can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled
another plant last week.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. made Thursday's announcement in the face of
state pressure.
   Later in the day, the demolished plant's operator said a leaking
natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquake-force
blasts May 4, which killed two people, injured 326 and did an
estimated $73 million in damage.
   The report by Pacific Engineering and Production Co. was
challenged by Southwest Gas Corp., which said the line ruptured
after the explosions, not before.
   Kerr-McGee said it would suspend production of ammonium
perchlorate, an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle
and military rockets, until an independent inspection shows the
plant is safe.
   Paul Gaines, the company's director of governmental relations,
said he hoped production could resume within a few days.
   ``A prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us,'' Gaines
said.
   He said the company has already contracted with a safety
consultant to study the plant, and the inspection could begin by
Monday. Gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals.
   Gov. Richard Bryan announced the shutdown after company
officials agreed late Thursday morning to the halt. Bryan said
``legal work was being prepared'' to force Kerr-McGee to suspend
production before it agreed to the shutdown.
   Local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant
resumed production Tuesday of ammonium perchlorate, particularly
since last week plant officials said they would wait until
authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening.
   Kerr-McGee and Pacific were the only two plants in the country
to manufacture ammonium perchlorate, and National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials have said the explosion could delay
the space shuttle program..
   Pacfic Engineering Chairman Fred Gibson said Thursday that a
large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking
for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at his
company's plant.
   ``The massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth
below the paved surfaces of the ... plant and to have ignited at
the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to
(plant) operations,'' Gibson said.
   ``All of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the
gas leak, the gas fire and the gas explosion,'' he said.
   Southwest Gas spokesman Dennis Hetherington disputed the report.
   ``As far as we're concerned, our facilities are a victim of the
explosion and not the cause,'' Hetherington said.
   Fire Chief Roy Parrish said the fire department would withhold
judgment until it completes its own investigation.

   Summer will arrive a week early this
year, according to a tiny hermit crab and a dachshund named Gus The
Amazing Weather Dog.
   The crab, named Martin Z. Mollusk, was carried to the beach
under warm, sunny skies Thursday for the annual ritual in this
Jersey resort.
   Martin ``predicted'' that summer will arrive June 14 instead of
June 21, said city spokesman Mark Soifer.
   ``For the 13th consecutive year, Martin has seen his shadow,''
Soifer said. ``If it was cloudy, we would use a flashlight to make
sure he saw it.''
   The forecast method is unabashedly similar to that of
Punxsutawney Phil, the Pennsylvania groundhog used to predict when
spring will arrive.
   Gus The Amazing Weather Dog served as Mollusk's translator.
   ``Gus can get down really low,'' Soifer explained. ``He sniffed
around Martin and woofed and let us know, then he tried to bury
Martin.''

<HEAD>Seniors Try To Baffle Underclassmen in Annual Ritual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholarly pursuits gave way to a soda
taste test, dismantling a car and other bizarre pursuits as
California Institute of Technology underclassmen tried to break
into seniors' cleverly defended rooms.
   In an annual ritual known as Ditch Day on Thursday, the students
solved puzzles or met elaborate requirements to gain entry to the
rooms of seniors, who remained on campus at the risk of being tied
to a tree.
   ``We had a report that a senior came back and was tied to a
tree,'' said Marty O'Brien, 19, of Houston, who fielded questions
at ``Ditch Day Central.''
   For obscure reasons the challenges left by the seniors are known
as ``stacks.''
   O'Brien said one stack he came across involved disassembling a
car and making the pieces fit in four 55-gallon drums.
   Students working on other stacks found they had to climb
buildings. ``There's been reports of clues being placed on the
sides of buildings 25, 30 feet in the air,'' O'Brien said.
   The sophomore said he worked on a stack created by a senior who
left a computer terminal outside his door. The computer asked
questions and, when given the right answer, delivered part of the
combination to the lock.
   The stack's rules required students to don ``lab coats and nerdy
safety glasses so we could look as scientific as possible'' and set
up a soda taste test on a campus walkway, O'Brien said.
   ``It looks like RC (Cola) slimly over Coke, and Pepsi was way
down at the end,'' said the chemical engineering major.
   O'Brien and his cohorts eventually got into the room.
   ``I thought we had moments of inspiration which were quite
helpful,'' he said.
   Freshman Mark Dinan, 18, of Washington, D.C., was part of a crew
whose stack required them to collect $5 for Amnesty International,
water 10 plants around campus, erect anti-Ronald Reagan and
anti-George Bush signs, and write and sing a song to find code
words spread around the school.
   ``We ran into some trouble one time because somebody stole the
clue,'' Dinan said, adding that the puzzle was solved within 4{
hours.

<HEAD>Lady Bing Arrested for Violating Court Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of former Metropolitan Opera director
Sir Rudolf Bing was again ordered to leave her husband alone for
six hours a day and to stay away from the woman she is accused of
slapping.
   Carroll Douglass Bing, 48, was arrested Thursday at the Essex
House apartment on exclusive Central Park South she shares with
Bing, 86.
   She was arrested because she violated a court order that she
stay away from her husband so nurses can take care of him, police
said. Bing suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Lady Bing is a former
mental patient.
   Due to her arrest, Lady Bing missed a court appearance to answer
a charge that on Feb. 24 she slapped Barbara Quinones, vice
president of Columbia Artists Management Inc.
   The judge in that case, Paula Omansky, issued a bench warrant
for Lady Bing's arrest. She was brought before Omansky, who vacated
the bench warrant and adjourned the charge in contemplation of
dismissal.
   During the proceeding Lady Bing walked around, talking and
running her hands through her straw-colored hair. A court officer
ordered her to sit.
   ``You don't understand,'' Lady Bing said. ``I have to go home.
I've been all day without food _ zero food, drink, nothing, not
even one french fry.''
   Omansky renewed an order for Lady Bing ``to stay away from Mrs.
Quinones and not harass her.''
   Later, the district attorney's office said it wouldn't prosecute
Lady Bing for violating Monday's order by state Supreme Court
Justice Carmen Ciparick to leave her husband alone for six hours a
day so that a nurse can feed and cleanse him.
   ``We're going to decline to prosecute this as a criminal
matter,'' spokeswoman Colleen Roche said.
   Lady Bing is in a civil court fight with her husband's lawyer,
Paul Goldhamer, who has asked Ciparick to annul the Bings' marriage.
   Goldhamer, who charges that Lady Bing has abused her husband
verbally and physically, says Bing did not know what he was doing
when he got married in Arlington, Va. on Jan. 9, 1987.

   Prosecutors say they're ready to press their drug
case against Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, while a
federal judge investigates whether the government could drop
charges against the embattled leader.
   Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, the lead
prosecutor in the case, said Thursday he strongly opposed any deal
in the case as part of an effort to persuade Noriega to surrender
his post.
   ``I am against the dismissal, and right now I am ready to try
this case,'' Gregorie said.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, who met with Attorney General Edwin
Meese III in Washington, agreed.
   In a statement released through his office, Kellner did not
divulge details of his meeting with Meese but said he was ready to
proceed with the trial.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged Thursday
that U.S. officials were engaged in ``plea bargaining'' with
Noriega, but stopped short of saying that dismissal of the
indictments was under negotiation.
   Noriega is charged in a 12-count Miami indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin Cartel to protect
its interests, while in Tampa he faces three marijuana smuggling
counts.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who is handling the case,
questioned whether the government alone can drop the drug
indictment against Noriega.
   ``My understanding and knowledge of the law is that the
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the
motion of the government,'' Hoeveler said. ``However, I am having
the law researched further.''
   In previous rulings on the case, Hoeveler has noted the
government has an obligation to show the indictment was not
politically motivated.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who brought the Tampa indictment
against Noriega, refused to comment Thursday on reports that he has
threatened to quit if the charges are dropped.
   But Noriega's attorneys said the government has little choice
but to dismiss the indictment because it was politically motivated.
   ``Gen. Noriega believes, and always has believed, that the
indictment against him was a political indictment,'' Noriega
attorney Neal Sonnett said Thursday. ``So a dismissal of the
indictment would have to be a pre-condition to any discussions.''

   George Rose's adopted
18-year-old son and the youth's natural father were among four
people charged with murdering the Tony award-winning actor, police
said.
   The natural father said Rose had sexually abused his son,
Domingo Antonio Ralfe Vazquez, as well as other youths.
   Police and doctors also said cocaine was found on the
68-year-old Rose and that laboratory tests performed in Miami
showed traces of a cocaine derivative in his body at the time of
his death.
   In a sworn statement police gave reporters on Thursday, Juan
Antonio Vazquez Padilla, the natural father of Ralfe Vazquez, said
the British-born performer was held for eight hours on May 4 before
being clubbed to death.
   Vazquez said the killers tried to make the death look like the
result of a single-car accident, on which initial police reports
blamed it.
   A statement read by police spokesman Col. Aquiles Cruz Gomez at
a news conference said Vazquez, Ralfe, and the youth's uncle,
Maximo Padilla Vazquez, were arrested. A fourth suspect was at
large.
   The statement said the three had ``confessed to police that they
planned the crime when they noticed Mr. George Rose felt certain
amorous weaknesses for another 14-year old minor.''
   The three appeared at the news conference and told reporters
they took part in the actor's death.
   ``What I really wanted was to take revenge on the American Rose
because of his homosexual activities, since he was hurting a lot of
boys in this sector, in addition to mine, whom he had already
prostituted since the age of 13,'' Vazquez said in the statement.
   However, Bea Garcia, a longtime friend and neighbor of Rose in
the north coast town of Sosua, told The New York Times in a
telephone interview that Rose had adopted Ralfe in January because
he wanted an heir, but had become disenchanted with the youth
because he was not attending to a business in which the actor had
invested $25,000.
   She added that, two weeks before he was killed, Rose told her he
wanted to make changes in his will.
   Vazquez said Ralfe, Padilla and another man he paid $200 agreed
to take Rose to an isolated location and kill him.
   On May 4, when Rose was driving his car to the city of Santiago
with Ralfe, the three other men waited by the side of the road near
Sosua and forced the car to stop.
   They got in, leaving Ralfe behind, and drove to a nearby farm,
where they held Rose for eight hours before killing him, it said.
   ``Around 8 p.m. we clubbed him to death, beating him on the
head,'' the statement said.
   Vazquez's statement said the men took the money from Rose's
pockets and divided it, but left his documents intact. They then
put Rose's body in the car and drove to a small ditch, where ``we
flipped the car over to make it look like a traffic accident.''
   Pathologist Sergio Sarita told reporters Thursday that the car
was determined to have been traveling under 10 mph when it went
into the ditch, so Rose's injuries had to have occurred earlier.
   He also said tests in Miami showed traces of a cocaine
derivative in Rose's urine but none in his brain.
   Police said cocaine was also found in Rose's wallet.
   The actor had owned a beach home outside Sosua for the past nine
years.
   Ralfe, who lived in the house, said in a sworn statement
released by police that he met Rose six years ago when he was a
student and that Rose suggested adopting him in 1985.
   He said Vazquez agreed and the adoption was legal.
   Ralfe said in the statement that on April 30, he told his father
Rose was returning to the island in a few days and that ``I felt
bad because he had shown he felt a certain weakness for a minor ...
who lived in our house.''
   Rose, who had lived in New York City since 1961, was a versatile
actor who was as much at home playing Shakespeare as he was in a
comedy or a musical. He preferred the stage, but also appeared in
scores of motion pictures and television productions.
   A memorial service is planned for May 25 at the Shubert Theater.

   Two Chinese men who threatened to blow up
a Boeing 737 unless it flew from the mainland to Taiwan were
welcomed as refugees today because they ``risked their lives to
seek freedom and democracy,'' Taiwan said.
   China thanked the rival government for returning the Chinese
airliner and its 107 passengers and 11 crew members today, nine
hours after the aircraft was hijacked to a Taiwanese military base.
   The air pirates, meanwhile, appeared on Taiwan television and
said they would have killed themselves had their hijacking failed.
   Chang Ching-kuo, 27, said in an interview on Taiwain's official
Chinese Television Service that he and his companion, Lung
Kuei-yun, 26, used a toy pistol and a bottle of a phony explosive
to force the plane to Taiwan Thursday.
   He said he and Lung also carried knives.
   ``We would have committed suicide if we failed,'' Chang said on
television. ``We never planned to return (to China).''
   The aircraft was hijacked Thursday evening after it left the
coastal city of Xiamen in Fujian province for Canton, the capital
of neighboring Guangdong province.
   It landed at an air force base in central Taiwan at about 9:30
p.m. Less than six hours later, the plane was refueled and sent
back to Xiamen with the passengers aboard.
   The hijackers remained in Taiwan and were granted political
asylum.
   Chang was identified as a worker at an arsenal in China's
southern Yunnan province, and Lung, a steel mill worker in southern
Guizhou province.
   A smiling Chang displayed a toy pistol and a bottle during the
televised interview. He said he defected because he ``detested the
brutality of communism.''
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said at a news conference that
authorities were investigating the air piracy. It was the first
hijacking of a civilian Chinese airplane to Taiwan.
   The Chinese Communists and the Taiwan Nationalists both claim to
be the legitimate rulers of China and have no direct communications
links.
   ``The two (hijackers) are our compatriots,'' Shaw said. ``They
have risked their lives to seek freedom and democracy. We must
respect their wishes and offer them protection. Their motives were
simple and noble.''
   Taiwan does ``not condone nor encourage any hijacking
behavior,'' Shaw said. He added: ``We would have been sending them
to their doom if we turned them back to the communists.''
   The hijackers didnot appear at the news conference.
   In Beijing, Hu Yizhou, director general of the national airliner
Civil Aviation Administration of China, originally asked Taiwan to
return the hijackers.
   After the plane flew back to Xiamen, however, Hu thanked the
Civil Aeronautics Bureau in Taiwan for the quick return of the
airliner and those aboard without mentioning the hijackers.
   ``We are very grateful to you for your help,'' Hu was quoted as
saying by China's official Xinhua News Agency.
   Xiamen, in southeastern Fujian province, is 136 miles across the
Taiwan Straits from Taiwan.
   In 1986, when the pilot of a Taiwan airliner operated by China
Airlines diverted his plane to Canton, mainland officials returned
the plane and other crew members but did not hand over the
defecting pilot.
   That incident led to the first direct talks between Communist
and Nationalist officials. Last fall, the Nationalists lifted a ban
on travel to the mainland.

   A twin-engine plane crashed into
the side of a valley on North Island, killing all nine people
aboard, including three children, officials said today.
   Rescue workers in helicopters found the wreckage of the Piper
Seneca early today in rugged country near the Cook Strait town of
Wanganui. The cause of the crash was not determined.
   The victims included a woman and her two children, ages 9 and 7,
and a 19-month-old boy and his mother, said police spokesman Rob
Rattenbury. All passengers and crew members were New Zealanders.
   The plane vanished from radar screens as it approached Wanganui
on a flight from Hamilton, said Peter Northcote of the Rescue
Coordinating Center in Wellington.
   Northcote said wreckage was strewn along the side of Ahuahu
Valley about 20 miles north of Wanganui.
   The plane, one of three from Foxpine Air Charter Ltd. of Foxton,
lost radio contact Thursday evening, Northcote said.

   A Cabinet minister who said Japan was not an
aggressor in World War II resigned today, an official in his
governing Liberal Democratic Party said.
   Seisuke Okuno, director general of the National Land Agency,
submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Japan
Broadcast Corp. also reported Okuno resigned.
   A remark by Okuno three weeks ago that Japan was not an
aggressor in World War II had drawn condemnation from China, South
Korea and North Korea.
   The veteran politician is widely regarded as the No. 3 man in
government after Takeshita and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
   Earlier today, Okuno apologized to Japanese officials for the
furor his comments had caused but continued to stand by them.
   ``I may withdraw my remarks if they disrupt the Diet
(parliament), but what I said was not wrong,'' he told a group of
parliamentarians.
   To reporters, Okuno said: ``My comments have incurred criticism
outside Japan and aroused friction in the Diet. As a result, the
Diet ... and other concerned bodies have suffered.
   ``From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.''
   The report of his resignation followed press reports that Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita wanted Okuno to step down voluntarily.
Kyodo News Service said Takeshita met with the 75-year-old Okuno
today and brought up the option.
   It was also a reversal of policy for Takeshita, who had avoided
disputing Okuno's remarks or taking any action against him since
Okuno said April 22 that Japan had no aggressive intent in World
War II.
   Okuno had said Japan ``fought to protect itself at a time when
the white race had turned Asia into a colony.''
   The comment drew condemnation from China, South Korea and North
Korea and threatened to strain Asian relations at a time when
Japan's ties with its main ally, the United States, are marred by
trade tensions.
   Opposition leaders today stepped up their calls for Okuno's
resignation in meetings with Cabinet officials. The main opposition
Japan Socialist Party and the Komeito (Clean Government Party) had
already decided to submit a no-confidence resolution in Parliament
against Okuno if he did not resign, a Komeito official said.
   It was Okuno's third brush with controversy in his political
career.
   As education minister under then Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka in
the early 1970s, he faced a no-confidence motion after he called
the Japan Teachers Union a ``dissident group.''
   Ten years later, as premier Zenko Suzuki's justice minister, he
was criticized for advocating revision of Japan's constitution,
which renounces the use of war.
   Okuno's latest comments came after a visit to Yasukuni Shrine in
downtown Tokyo, where war heroes and Class A war criminals are
enshrined. Foreign leaders, including China's Deng Xiaoping,
criticized such official visits.

   The nation's nursing shortage worsened last year,
causing delays in admissions, surgery and temporary closings of
emergency rooms, the American Hospital Association says.
   ``The nursing shortage continues to be a problem for most
hospitals, and although fewer hospitals report a severe shortage,
we still have the same situation _ not enough nurses,'' Joan Moss,
director of the association's Center for Nursing, said Thursday.
   Of 2,000 randomly surveyed hospitals, 78.6 percent reported a
nursing shortage in April 1987, up 2.4 percent from a year earlier,
the Chicago-based association said.
   Large hospitals in urbans areas on both coasts were more acutely
affected than smaller, rural institutions in the nation's
midsection.
   To combat the nursing shortage, three out of four hospitals
surveyed relied on overtime for nursing staff and 41 percent
employed temporary or agency nurses.
   Foreign nurses were recruited by 10 percent of hospitals,
predominately larger hospitals in the East.
   The association is a not-for-profit organization that serves as
a national advocate for hospitals and informs the public about
health care issues.

   A former aide to
ex-President Salvador Jorge Blanco has been fined $3 million and
sentenced to nine months in jail for embezzling $85,000.
   Rafael Flores Estrella, a member of the Chamber of Deputies and
Blanco's former administrative assistant, was sentenced following
his conviction Thursday night by the Supreme Court.
   He is one of nearly 20 former government officials, including
Jorge Blanco, accused of widespread corruption that allegedly
occurred during the former president's administration. Estrella was
the first to stand trial.
   Flores Estrella was tried by the Supreme Court because he is a
member of the legislature, a post he automatically loses because of
his conviction.
   He was charged with taking $85,000 from the treasury for a 1985
trip that Jorge Blanco was to make to Panama and Costa Rica.
Prosecutors alleged the trip was never taken and the money never
was returned.
   Flores Estrella denied any wrongdoing.
   The court stipulated that one day would be added to his jail
term for each dollar of the $3 million fine that Flores Estrella
does not pay.
   Jorge Blanco and other officials are accused of misusing
government funds to buy military equipment at inflated prices and
embezzling money earmarked for a public food program.
   Jorge Blanco, president from 1982 to 1986, has said the charges
are politically motivated. The corruption probe was ordered by
current President Joaquin Balaguer after he took office.
   The former chief executive was allowed to leave Santo Domingo a
year ago for treatment of a heart ailment at Emory University
Hospital in Atlanta.
   Jorge Blanco has ignored an order to return home and the
government has not attempted to extradite him. He is expected to be
tried regardless of whether he returns.

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early studies of a highly publicized drug for
Alzheimer's disease show some promise, but also serious side
effects in up to 80 percent of patients, a researcher says.
   Nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions and a worrisome increase in
liver enzymes have appeared in patients taking the drug, said Vinod
Kumar of the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in
Springfield.
   No conclusions can be reached yet about the usefulness of
tetrahydroaminoacridine, often called THA, he said Thursday.
   Kumar reviewed results of published and unpublished studies from
Canada, Britain, Sweden and the United States at the annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric Association.
   THA generated excitement in 1986 when a study in the New England
Journal of Medicine reported dramatic improvement in Alzheimer
symptoms, particularly those related to memory deficits.
   A nationwide study at 17 institutions began last September, but
it was stopped in October because about 20 percent of patients
showed the liver abnormalities. The trial was restarted earlier
this year.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible neurological
disorder affecting an estimated 2.5 million Americans. It kills
more than 100,000 people a year.
   Symptoms include gradual memory loss, impaired judgment,
disorientation, personality change and loss of language skills.
Eventually patients can no longer take care of themselves.
   The disease's cause is unknown, and it has no cure.
   Kumar, an investigator in the nationwide THA project, said early
results at his institution are promising enough to justify
continuing the study, but they do not prove that the drug is
effective.
   In one of the new studies, Kumar said, Canadian researchers
reported significant improvement among 17 patients who took THA for
six weeks. But 80 percent of the 51 patients who began the study
suffered side effects, and 36 percent of the 17 who completed the
experiment had the liver problem, which indicates cellular
abnormalities.
   A Swedish study found significant improvement in five of 10
patients who took THA for one to two weeks. But the side effects
appeared in seven patients, and two showed allergic reactions to
the drug that Kumar said had not been reported before.
   Three of six patients in a British study showed dramatic
improvement but also the liver enzyme increase, he said.
   In contrast to the other studies, a 10-patient experiment in
California found no improvement after one week on THA. Perhaps the
drug must be taken longer to have an effect, Kumar said.
   Three of the California patients had the liver enzyme problem.
   ``No one in any way expects this to be a cure in that it halts
the progression of Alzheimer's disease,'' said THA investigator
Maurice Dysken of the University of Minnesota.
   Instead, the hope is that it will quickly produce an improvement
in learning and memory, he said. If the patient's abilities then
deteriorate at the same rate as they would have without the drug,
he will at least be starting from a higher level and so be better
off at any given point during the decline, Dysken said.
   ``That would be an advance,'' Dysken said in an interview.
   ``If you had a drug that delayed the need for nursing home
treatment, that's not a trivial effect,'' said Stephen Read, an
Alzheimer researcher at the John Douglas French Center in Los
Alamitos, Calif.

<HEAD>Afghan Leader Replaces 23 Provincial Governors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government has replaced 23 of the country's 29
provincial governors without explaining why.
   Official Radio Kabul, monitored Thursday night in Islamabad,
said President Najib has named new governors in 23 provinces
including Kabul.
   It then gave a list of all 23 but nothing more.
   Terse announcements are common in the radio's Pushtu, Farsi,
Urdu and English newscasts. The change of governors appeared
connected with national elections Najib suddenly called in April.
   Official figures indicated voter turnout was about 20 percent in
the vote for parliamentary and provincial officials from a slate of
socialist parties.
   Western diplomats in Kabul have said most parties are fronts for
the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   The burly Najib, former chief of the feared State Security
Agency KHAD, has made frequent government shake-ups in his two
years in power.
   His fate soon will be in the hands of his 100,000-man security
force when Soviet troops leave.
   Under an agreement signed last month in Geneva, the estimated
115,000 Red Army soldiers are to begin withdrawing Sunday.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to replace one
pro-Soviet regime with another and defend it against a U.S.-backed
Moslem rebel movement, which is believed to control about 80
percent of the countryside.
   Guerrillas and diplomats said Thursday that about 4,000 Soviet
soldiers have started evacuating their biggest garrison in eastern
Afghanistan in preparation for the total pullout.
   People coming from Jalalabad, site of the Soviet garrison, are
reporting that ``the Russians are sending their heavy equipment to
Kabul,'' said Kabir, a member of the military committee of the
Yunis Khalis guerrilla faction.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
guerrilla sources reported that up to 60 Soviet trucks headed west
Thursday toward Kabul, 110 miles away.
   Moscow's troops reportedly have handed dozens of posts over to
Afghan troops in recent weeks. But well-armed guerrilla fighters
have overrun many of them.

<HEAD>Atlanta Hospital First in Nation to Use New Gallstone Smasher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A machine that smashes gallstones using shock
waves was used for the first time in the United States, and the
patient involved in the landmark treatment said it was a lot more
pleasant than surgery.
   Lyn Hicks, 35, of Carrollton, joined her doctors at a press
briefing Thursday at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in
Atlanta, the first in the nation to use a new gallstone lithotripsy
technique, according to hospital officials.
   The treatment, Ms. Hicks said, was ``virtually painless.''
   ``I was released on a Thursday, and I could have gone back to
work Friday,'' she said. She wound up going back to work the next
Monday, after a follow-up visit the day after her release.
   Ms. Hicks said she could feel pressure akin to a slap each time
the machine fired shock waves at her midsection and was left with
some ``mild tenderness'' afterward _ a far cry from surgery
recuperation.
   ``I work at a hospital,'' said Ms. Hicks, assistant director of
registration for emergency patients at Carrollton's Tanner Medical
Center. ``I know what serious surgery it is.''
   Crawford Long is one of 10 U.S. medical centers selected for
trials of a gallstone lithotripter that has shown promising results
in tests in West Germany, officials said Thursday at the news
conference.
   The machine, similar to those now commonly used to smash kidney
stones, represents a ``major step forward in medicine,'' said Dr.
Harold S. Ramos, medical director at Crawford Long.
   Gallstones are small, hard masses that can form in the gall
bladder. The lithotripter uses ultrasound to locate the gallstones
and send shock waves into the gall bladder, literally smashing them
to sand-size fragments, which can then be passed into the intestine
and out of the body.
   Previously, gallstones have been removed only through complex
surgery, which can require a week of hospitalization and six to
eight weeks of recuperation.
   ``For the first time, we will be able to manage gallstones
effectively without surgery, without putting the patient to sleep,
without interruption in their daily lives,'' Ramos said.
   The 10 medical centers will use a Dornier MPL-9000 biliary
lithotripter in investigative trials on some 600 selected patients
who meet certain criteria.
   If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the technique
could become the method of choice for treatment of gallstones,
which plague as many as 20 million Americans each year, according
to Dr. R. Carter Davis, chief of the hospital's Gastrointestinal
Diagnostic Laboratory.
   Although patients during the trials will be hospitalized for two
nights, ``in the near future, it will be reduced to an outpatient
procedure,'' predicted Dr. William E. Torres, associate professor
of radiology at Emory University and one of the physicians involved
in the study.
   In trials on some 600 German patients, about 80 percent have
been completely free of gallstones or fragments 10 months after
treatment, and only 10-15 percent have reported mild, ``minimal''
side effects, said Dr. Gustav Paumgartner, chairman of the
Department of Gastroenterology at the University of Munich.
   In addition to Crawford Long, trials are being conducted at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles; the University of Iowa,
Iowa City; Northwestern University Medical Center, Chicago;
Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis; Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston; the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia; Humana Hospital of San Antonio, Texas; Johns Hopkins
Hospital, Baltimore; and the University of Virginia School of
Medicine, Charlottesville.

   Author Shen Congwen, a vivid portrayer of Chinese
rural life during the chaotic warlord era of the 1920s and 1930s,
died of a sudden heart attack, a former student said today. He was
85.
   Shen died Tuesday in Beijing, where he had lived quietly in
recent decades researching ancient Chinese costumes and folk arts,
said Wu Ningkun, an English professor at the International
Relations Institute.
   Wu said Shen had been in poor health for the last five years and
needed help to walk.
   Shen's novels and short stories describe rural life with an
ironic eye and sympathy for free-spirited minority groups opposed
to central control. His own outspokenness got him into trouble when
the Communists came to power in 1949.
   State-run media has not mentioned Shen's death despite his
partial rehabilitation in recent years.
   Shen could describe tersely and without sentiment the casual
violence of the 20s and 30s, as warlords battled each other for
power after the emperor was overthrown. But he also produced lyric
descriptions of the pastoral life he knew as a child in central
Hunan province.
   Many of his short works have been translated into English and
other languages, and he is one of the most widely anthologized
modern writers in English-language collections of Chinese
literature.
   Shen was born in November or December 1902 into a family of
career soldiers. He was sent to military school at age 13 and
joined a regiment two years later. He left the army after several
years to work in a tax office and later for a newspaper.
   In his early 20s, Shen went to Beijing to study and write. Soon,
his short stories were appearing in the prestigious Short Story
Monthly and the literary journal Crescent Moon, which helped
pioneer the use of colloquial language in literature.
   He gained fame in the 1930s with a series of longer works,
including The Border Town and The Long River, both about rural life
in Hunan.
   He also taught at a various colleges, including Beijing
University, until 1949 when he was publicly criticized as a
reactionary. Shen tried to commit suicide by drinking kerosene and
slitting his wrists and throat.
   Even an old literary friend, the renowned woman novelist Ding
Ling, by then a member of the official literary establishment,
criticized Shen as having upper-class ambitions. Ding died in 1986.
   In a self-criticism ordered by the authorities, Shen wrote that
his early work had ``a style but no sense of life. Most of my
writing was of no use to the people's revolution.''
   After his recovery, he was assigned to work as a guide at the
Palace Museum in Beijing. He became an expert on early Chinese
silks and costumes, bronze mirrors and other artifacts and began
researching and writing about these full time, giving up fictional
writing.
   Like many intellectuals, Shen was sent to the countryside to
learn from the peasants during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but
escaped serious attack.
   In recent years, he returned to partial favor. His literary
works have been republished in Chinese and in official English
editions, and he was selected to the Standing Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory
body of intellectuals.
   He is survived by his wife, Zhang Zhaohe, and two sons. Funeral
plans were not immediately announced.

   The steepest energy price gain in 15 months
pushed wholesale costs up a moderate 0.4 percent in April, the
government said today. Food prices were modestly higher.
   If the April increase held for 12 straight months, inflation at
the wholesale level would register an annual increase of 4.6
percent, more than double the 2.2 percent 1987 wholesale price rise.
   The April increase, coming after a 0.6 percent gain in March,
the sharpest rise in almost a year, seems certain to add to
concerns that inflation is reheating.
   In an effort to cool off the economy, the Federal Reserve has
recently moved to make cash less readily available to the nation's
banking system. That credit tightening prompted the nation's major
banks on Wednesday to boost their prime lending rate from 8.5
percent to 9 percent as concern spread that inflation is now a
greater threat than recession.
   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from September
through February, recorded a 3.1 percent surge, dramatically
higher, even, than the 0.9 percent jump of March.
   Such prices, which Labor Department analysts said accounted for
half of the rise in the overall index, have not jumped so steeply
since January 1987.
   The energy price surge was widespread, with the cost of gasoline
up 0.7 percent, the price of home heating oil up 5.2 percent and
the cost of natural gas up 4.3 percent.
   Analysts, noting that crude oil prices are on the upswing, say
motorists can expect further rises in gasoline prices. The
wholesale price of gasoline rose 1.5 percent in March, the first
gain since August.
   As for food, gains were posted for pork (1.7 percent), chicken
(4.7 percent), vegetables (2.1 percent) and coffee (2.1 percent).
These rises were offset, however, by sharp declines in the prices
of eggs (16.3 percent), fruit (4.4 percent), fish (2.6 percent) and
beef (0.1 percent).
   Overall, food prices at wholesale were up 0.4 percent, about
half of the 0.7 percent increase of the previous month.
   The index of wholesale prices minus food and energy was up a
tiny 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent increase in March. This
slowdown was likely to be viewed as good news as economists believe
this calculation is a more accurate reflection of underlying
inflationary pressures.
   Part of the reason for the April slowdown in this calculation
was a 0.5 percent drop in new car prices, a big turnaround from a
1.0 percent increase in March.
   In releasing its Producer Price Index for goods one step short
of the retail level, the Labor Department gave these additional
details on April activity:
   _Capital equipment costs were up a moderate 0.2 percent, half
the increase of the previous month.
   _Children's clothing prices gained 0.6 percent while men's
clothing costs gained 0.1 percent, the same as the gain recorded
for women's apparel.
   For the first four months of 1988, wholesale prices have risen
at an annual rate of 2.9 percent.
   The wholesale price index has been showing more restraint than
the companion consumer price index, in part because the consumer
index charts two areas of considerable recent inflation _ services
and imported goods. These sectors are not tracked in the wholesale
price calculation.
   The Consumer Price Index rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and was up 0.5
percent in March. The CPI figures for April will be released next
week.
   The April increase brought the overall wholesale price index to
106.9. This means that a selection of wholesale goods costing $100
during a 1982 base period would have cost $106.90 last month. This
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other
figures in the report.

   Israeli riot police entered the sacred Temple
Mount today and fired rubber bullets at protesting Moslem
worshipers on the final Sabbath of the holy month of Ramadan.
Fifteen Arabs and two policemen were injured, army radio said.
   An estimated 5,000 worshipers crowded the Al Aqsa mosque to mark
the holy day. The figure was much lower than in previous years.
Officials, fearing violence, closed off large parts of the occupied
territories and blocked Palestinians from reaching Jerusalem to
worship.
   The army command reported today that Israeli soldiers shot and
killed a Palestinian in the West Bank village of Qabatiyeh on
Thursday after he ignored orders to halt during a search of the
village.
   The death brings to 187 the number of Palestinians killed since
the beginning of the Arab uprising Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a
teen-age girl also have died.
   The army said 300 Palestinians from the West Bank were being
released from prison today as a goodwill gesture. An army spokesman
said some of the prisoners had been arrested on security charges
and others for criminal offenses but did not elaborate.
   An army helicopter hovered over the Temple Mount and military
police perched on rooftops as about 1,000 worshipers emerged from
prayers chanting pro-PLO slogans and burning Israeli flags. Several
hundred hurled stones at a nearby Israeli police station.
   Hundreds of helmeted military police then broke into the
complex, firing rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.
   Army radio said 15 protesters and two policemen were injured.
Police spokesmen could not be reached for comment.
   Israel radio said at least 20 people were arrested.
   Hundreds of worshipers remained inside the Al Aqsa mosque,
afraid to leave, after police entered the Temple Mount, known to
the Arabs as Harm al Sharif, or ``Noble Enclosure.'' The Moslem
prayer leader called on police to withdraw.
   ``Go away!'' prayer leader Mohammed Hussein called out through
the mosque loudspeakers. ``Allow the Moslems to leave peacefully.''
   Outside, worshipers paraded outlawed Palestinian flags and black
flags of mourning as they circled the mosque complex.
   ``Jews out!'' the protesters chanted. ``We don't want to see any
Zionists!''
   Others shouted: ``No fear, no fear. The stone is better than the
Kalashnikov (rifle)!''
   Unprecedented security precautions were implemented to thwart
expected violence beginning Thursday night, when Moslems celebrated
the ``Night of Fate,'' a holiday marking the revelation of the
Koran, Islam's holy book, to the prophet Mohammed.
   Journalists and non-residents were barred from the Gaza Strip,
home to 650,000 Palestinians, and the West Bank city of Ramallah,
home to 40,000. Police and soldiers turned back cars from the West
Bank heading for Jerusalem.
   Police Commissioner David Kraus said 3,300 policemen were
deployed in Jerusalem to maintain order.
   The army also clamped curfews on 120,000 Palestinians in Nablus,
the largest West Bank city, and neighboring refugee camps. A
military spokesman said the curfews were imposed in the morning
after the army received reports that disturbances might break out.
   Curfews also were in effect in parts of Gaza City and the
Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem. During a curfew, residents are
barred from leaving their homes.
   This reporter counted three roadblocks in the 10-mile stretch of
road between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Soldiers turned back every
car bearing West Bank license plates unless drivers carried special
military government permits.
   An army spokesman refused to comment on the roadblocks but said
the army was taking various measures to guarantee quiet over the
weekend and during the Id El Fitr holiday, which follows Ramadan.
   Ramadan is due to end Monday or Tuesday with the sighting of the
new moon.
   Officials also feared there might be violence Sunday, when
Israelis mark the 40th anniversary of the state and celebrate
Jerusalem Day, the 21st anniversary of the capture of Arab east
Jerusalem.
   Thursday night, one policeman was injured when a rock hit his
head during a aclash between riot police and worshipers on the
Temple Mount, Israel radio said. Thirty-eight Palestinians were
arrested for stone-throwing.

   Swimmers and surfers were ordered
from the water along a 5-mile stretch of beach when a 20-foot great
white shark cruised within 20 yards of the shore, lifeguards said.
   The shark was eventually frightened by a police helicopter sent
to track it and swam out to sea, authorities said.
   About 30 people were ordered from the water in this Orange
County beach town 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles after the
sighting Thursday afternoon, said lifeguard Eric Bauer.
   ``We have verified it as a great white, about a 20-footer,''
Bauer said. The water along the entire 5-mile length of Newport
Beach was evacuated, he said.
   The shark was first spotted by the crew of a boat operated by
Vessel Assist, which provides assistance to boaters at sea.
   Bauer said the appearance by a great white in Newport Beach
waters was unusual, noting that ``a couple of years ago we had a
15-foot hammerhead shark, but nothing since.''

<TEXT>
   Two sanitation workers found $48,900 in cash in
a cardbox they were throwing away and turned it in to authorities.
But the women whose trash can the bills came from say the money
isn't theirs.
   ``As far as I know it's not ours,'' said Marianne Bosted of the
two bundles of bills that fell out of a trash can Thursday behind
her house in Queens.
   ``I keep saying to my aunt, `Are you sure you weren't saving
this in a box to give to me?''' Ms. Bosted told the New York Post.
   The two Sanitation Department workers who found the cash have
insisted on anonymity, said department spokesman Vito Turso.
   ``I guess everybody has always fantasized about finding a lot of
money and what they would do with it,'' he said. ``These guys found
it and did the right thing _ they turned it in.''
   Police are trying to determine who the money belongs to and how
it got into Ms. Bosted's trash, said Police Sgt. John Venetucci.
   An officer at the 104th Precinct told New York Newsday the money
was discovered when the sanitation workers accidentally dropped a
cardboard box. The bottom broke and the money fell out, he said.
   The Daily News reached a woman who lived nearby who said: ``I
threw out some boxes that belonged to my (late) husband. I didn't
look inside of them.''

<HEAD>Psychoanalyst Under Fire Over Patient's Fortune Takes Leave from
Institute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of the American Psychiatric
Association is taking leave as president of a prestigious research
institute while he prepares to face accusations that he exploited a
wealthy patient, the institute says.
   Dr. George Pollock was granted a leave of absence from his
position as president of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis,
Gilda Buchbinder, chairwoman of the institute's board of trustees,
said Thursday.
   In court papers, Pollock has been accused of unduly influencing
the late Anne P. Lederer, who gave him $80,000 a year in trusts and
bequeathed $5 million to a psychiatric institute she founded during
the decade he treated her for depression.
   ``Dr. Pollock has requested and been granted a leave of absence
in order to have time to prepare for the trial of the lawsuit and
to address matters raised by news releases about that case,'' Mrs.
Buchbinder said. ``He has not resigned, nor has the board requested
him to resign.''
   The allegations against Pollock are contained in documents filed
by Mrs. Lederer's only child, Francis L. Lederer II, who is
contesting her will leaving him $200,000. Mrs. Lederer died in 1984
at age 78.
   Pollock, one of Chicago's leading psychoanalysts, has referred
all questions about the case to his attorney, Robert Tepper of
Chicago, who also declined comment Thursday.
   Pollock denied the allegations, however, in an affidavit Dec. 4,
1986.
   The case is to come to trial July 5 in Cook County Probate Court.
   Mrs. Buchbinder said that Dr. Henry Seidenberg, vice president
of the Chicago institute, would assume the president's duties in
Pollock's absence. The institute trains psychiatrists and
therapists to become psychoanalysts.
   ``The board has not appointed an interim president or a new
president,'' she said, declining to say anything further.
   Seidenberg also declined comment Thursday, saying, ``there is
litigation involved.''
   Pollock's term as president of the 34,000-member APA
automatically expired late Thursday at the end of the association's
annual meeting in Montreal. He is being succeeded by Dr. Paul J.
Fink of Philadelphia.
   Psychoanalysis is a branch of psychotherapy in which a patient
meets frequently with a therapist and is encouraged to explore his
or her innermost feelings, childhood experiences and other emotions.
   Pollock conducted up to five sessions a week with Mrs. Lederer
from 1969 to 1980.
   During those years, Mrs. Lederer established a trust fund that
has paid Pollock $50,000 a year since 1976 and will continue paying
him through 1993, court documents show. A second trust has paid
Pollock's family $30,000 a year since 1978, the records show.
   In 1980, Mrs. Lederer founded the Anne P. Lederer Research
Institute to promote psychiatric research and music. It has never
paid out any money because of the court fight, court documents show.

   K mart store officials don't know what
to make of hundreds of bags of grass fertilizer that were destroyed
after-hours when rebate coupons and their bar-code labels were cut
off. Nothing else was taken.
   In the past two weeks, three area stores have been hit and 658
bags of fertilizer damaged, The Palm Beach Post reported today.
   ``We came in the next morning, and we just couldn't believe
it,'' said Vance Callahan, manager of a Hollywood K mart, where 150
rebate coupons were cut out May 1.
   ``The fertilizer was all over the place,'' said David Phillips,
manager of a Deerfield Beach store, where the bar codes from 233
bags were cut out Sunday night.
   In the latest incident Tuesday, bar-code labels were ripped off
275 fertilizer bags at a Boca Raton store.
   Managers are baffled over why only the bar-code labels were
taken off some bags and only the rebate coupons _ which can be
redeemed for $3 or $4 _ off other bags. In order for the rebate to
be honored, the coupon must be accompanied by the bar-code label
and a store receipt, Callahan said Thursday.
   There's also another catch. There is a limit on the number of
rebates per household, managers said.
   ``Who knows?'' Phillips said. ``If they're taking this amount of
time and organization ... apparently they've got something that
works.''

   South Africa and Angola today
completed a second round of talks on Angola's 13-year civil war and
independence for South-West Africa and said they would meet again
with U.S. and Cuban diplomats present.
   South African Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha said the
Congo government had offered to host further talks.
   Botha also said the United States and Cuba, which were not
present at the meetings here today, would be invited to the next
round of talks. No date was given.
   This week's talks follow meetings last week in London, attended
by Angola, South Africa, Cuba and the United States.
   The United States and South Africa support Angolan rebels
fighting the Marxist government, which is backed by 40,000 Cuban
troops.
   According to a report Thursday by Angola's official news agency
ANGOP, the meetings here took place at the request of the South
African government. The Congo government did not participate.
   The South African delegation included Botha and Defense Minister
Gen. Magnus Malan. Angola was represented by Justice Minister
Fernando Van Dunem and the deputy chief of staff of the army.
   ``I want to affirm that my government strongly believes that we
as Africans ought to resolve our problems ourselves,'' Botha said.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
South Africa appeared to be trying to chart an independent course
in the negotiations.
   They said U.S. diplomats had not been officially informed of
today's meeting.
   But American diplomats praised Congo President Denis Sassou
Nguesso for hosting the talks and for helping the United States
arrange earlier meetings with Angola.
   Sassou Nguesso's socialist leadership has close ties with
Angola's Marxist government.
   Angola demands that South Africa withdraw an estimated 9,000
South African troops from southern Angolan soil and wants to halt
South African and U.S. aid to the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   Neither UNITA nor the South-West African People's Organization,
a group fighting South African rule in South-West Africa for 22
years, were included in the talks.
   Angola also demands that South Africa withdraw from South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, and grant the former German colony
independence in accordance with a 1978 U.N. Security Council
resolution.
   South Africa, backed by the United States, in turn demands the
full withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Cuban support troops from
Angola.
   U.S.-brokered peace talks on the related issues of the Angolan
civil war and Namibian independence have foundered for years on
reluctance by both sides to be the first to withdraw.
   A major breakthrough came in March, when Angolan and Cuban
negotiators presented U.S. officials with a proposed, four-year
plan to send the Cuban forces home. London talks on May 3-4
followed.
   South Africa was handed administration of Namibia after World
War I under a mandate of the now-defunct League of Nations. The
United Nations first called for the territory's independence in
1966.

   Rival Shiite militias battled with
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in the slums of south
Beirut today, shattering a 36-hour-old truce brokered by Syria and
Iran.
   There was no immediate report of casualties as Syrian and
Iranian mediators struggled to rescue the fraying cease-fire
between their main Lebanese proxies.
   The fighting between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the
Iranian-backed fundamentalists of Hezbollah, or Party of God,
flared anew in the Shiite neighborhoods of Raml el-Ali, Haret
Hreik, Ouzai and Ein el-Sikkeh.
   The clashes forced the closing of all roads leading to Beirut
airport, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Planes continued to take and land while bursts of gunfire hit
the runways and tarmac, the spokesman said.
   He said today's fighting was the most serious violation of the
cease-fire since it was called by Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria
and Ali Khamenei of Iran Wednesday night.
   That truce ended a six-day bloodbath in which at least 188
people were killed and 543 wounded in the savage street fighting
between Amal and Hezbollah for control of the 16 square miles of
slums.
   Most of the 18 foreign hostages held by Shiite extremists are
believed to be imprisoned in the embattled district.
   Assad's personal representative, Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, and
Khamenei's envoy, deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Sheikholeslam,
met at the Iranian embassy with delegates from the warring factions
in an effort to restore the cease-fire, the police spokesman said.
   Hezbollah's 3,000 fighters are outnumbered more than 2-to-1 by
Amal's Syrian-armed militia.
   Also today, the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio reported that
Christian militia leader Samir Geagea, a pro-Israeli foe of Syria,
was the target of a car bomb that exploded north of Beirut.
   Police confirmed that a car containing an estimated 330 pounds
of TNT exploded at 10 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT) Thursday in the village of
Mastita, 20 miles north of Beirut in the Christian heartland.
   But Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, the Christians' main
military machine, issued a communique denying that he had been the
target of an assassination attempt.
   No group has claimed responsibilty for the blast. On April 23, a
car bomb explosion killed 69 people and wounded 111 in the mainly
Moslem northern port of Tripoli.

   A 10-year-old boy who was suspended three
times after shouting biblical epithets at teachers and classmates
received his fourth suspension today after he stayed outside school
preaching as his mother watched.
   ``If it pleases the Lord, I'm enjoying it,'' said Duffey Strode
as an assistant principal tried to get him to come inside. ``I'd
rather get gold and silver up in heaven than my education down
here.''
   Duffey, recovering from chicken pox, arrived about 7:30 a.m. on
his bicycle in a steady rain and was immediately surrounded by some
two dozen reporters and cameramen. Wearing a black jacket and
carrying a zippered case apparently containing a Bible, he began
preaching in the parking lot.
   ``Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,'' he
shouted. ``Thou shalt not commit adultery! You're guilty! Even your
eyes are filled with adultery! Men can't keep their eyes off women
and women can't keep their eyes off men. Adulterers shall be put to
death and their blood shall be upon them!''
   Assistant Principal Shirley Ramsey told Duffey several times
that he was supposed to be in the school building before classes,
but the youngster ignored her.
   ``Everyone in there can do their hellish things. Why can't my
own do theirs?'' asked Robin Strode, Duffey's mother, after she
received the boy's letter of suspension from Eastfield Elementary
School.
   Mrs. Strode's other son, Matthew, 5, also has been suspended for
preaching. Her daughter, Pepper, 6, also has been suspended because
she stayed outside with her brothers while they preached. Matthew
and Pepper's suspensions expire May 19 and Mrs. Strode said she
expected them to be suspended again.
   She also said it was her children's decision to preach.
   ``After the first suspension, we asked them to stop preaching
for a couple of days,'' Mrs. Strode said. ``It just about broke
their hearts. They got real upset.''
   Mrs. Strode said the letter gave no indication about future
action to be taken against Duffey if he continued his street
preaching when he returns to school.
   Mrs. Ramsey said after handing the boy the letter, ``We're
trying to keep the door open for Duffey to return to school.''
   Today's suspension was the latest in a month-long battle between
the Strode family and school officials.
   ``I see no resolution in sight, I just don't see it,'' Duffey's
father, David Strode, said earlier this week. ``It's just a bunch
of people full of the devil. There must be a real cesspool of sin
here.''
   His son had been suspended once for fighting and twice before
for remaining outside the school, hurling biblical epithets at
students and teachers.
   Duffey's letters of suspension haven't mentioned his preaching.
Principal James Gorst wrote a letter to the Strodes that said the
boy had created ``a loud disruptive noise by screaming at school
staff members.''
   But Duffey's parents, who moved to Marion 17 months ago from
Pennsylvania, said they are convinced the only problem is Duffey's
preaching.
   The Strodes call the suspensions an attack on their
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of
religion and say they plan to take the county school system to
court.
   ``Nobody nowadays wants to stand up for Jesus Christ,'' Mrs.
Strode said. ``I just don't understand it.''
   Federal Appeals Court Judge Sam Ervin III told school officials
Thursday that if they take reasonable action in such cases, they
are protected under the law.
   ``Constitutional rights of students are not automatically
co-extensive with adults in a general setting,'' Ervin said.
   School officials and Duffey's parents agree that his street
preaching intensified after a March 18 scuffle with three other
boys at school.
   Gorst decided to paddle all four boys, but when it was Duffey's
turn, he bolted from the school and ran home, Mrs. Ramsey said.
   His flight earned him his first suspension.
   When he returned, he began his preaching, first directing his
warnings of hellfire and damnation at other students.
   Later, he hurled them at teachers as they arrived for work each
morning, calling them ``fornicators, whoremongers, adulterers and
queers.''

   Federal scientists are abandoning efforts to
develop a completely artificial human heart after spending more
than a quarter-billion dollars, because every use of such devices
has resulted in the eventual death of the patient.
   From now on, government research support will concentrate
instead on developing a smaller pump that can assist, rather than
replace, a failing heart.
   ``There are still a lot of problems'' that cannot soon be solved
with a total heart replacement device, Dr. Claude Lenfant, director
of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said Thursday.
   Every attempt at total heart replacement has resulted in a
patient dying of either infection or stroke caused by blood clots
that develop within the mechanical heart, said Lenfant.
   ``Those issues have not been resolved,'' he said in an interview.
   The National Institutes of Health have given a total of $2.7
million in research grants on the total-heart replacement this
year, but Lenfant said that will be the last. Since 1964, the
agency has spent $239.31 million on various elements of artificial
heart development technology.
   Now, Lenfant said, the agency will support only four grants for
the development of a self-contained, long-term ``single
ventricular'' device. This would be inserted into the left
ventricle of the heart, the chamber that endures most of the work
stress in the four-chambered human heart.
   ``We believe there can be an extremely reliable single ventricle
system developed for clinical application,'' said Lenfant.
   The single ventricle device already has been used in more than
170 cases as a ``bridge to transplant,'' but it has not been
implanted for long-term use, he said.
   John W. Wood Jr., president of Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass.,
said his company now has such a long-term device being tested in
experiments with animals.
   He said the device, which is an electrically driven,
diaphragm-like pump called the Heartmate, is inserted into the left
ventricle of the heart and powered by a battery.
   Powering the heart device has been solved with an electrical
conduction system.
   The Heartmate is equipped with an electrical coil, Wood said. A
similar coil is placed on the outside of the body and electricity
is conducted through the skin to recharge the battery. In this way,
the patient will have no wires or tubes leading to the artificial
pump, lowering the risk of infection.
   Wood said the device has been tested successfully on calves and
an application is pending for clinical trials.
   A second assist device, designed to be used only temporarily, is
now on the market. This device is inserted to assist the heart only
until the heart has recovered from trauma or until a donor heart
can be found.
   Lenfant said the total artificial heart replacement has been
attempted five times worldwide, but none was considered successful.
   The Jarvik-7 artificial heart was the most widely used in the
United States. Barney Clark received the first artificial heart on
Dec. 2, 1982. His University of Utah surgeon was Dr. William
DeVries. Clark died in March 1983.
   William Schroeder, who received his artificial heart at the
Humana-Audubon Hospital in Louisville, Ky., where DeVries practiced
later, lived longest with the Jarvik device _ almost two years.
   In a statement released by the Humana-Audubon Hospital, DeVries
said he regretted the NIH decision and said ``this decision will
delay the eventual clincial reality of the total artificial heart.''
   DeVries said the NIH decision will not affect his research
because it is privately financed. He predicted that because of such
government decisions, more and more advanced medical research will
have to be funded by the private sector.
   Lenfant said the Jarvik device was successful mechanically, but
``the interface with the body was never successful.''
   He said tubes leading to the outside may have contributed to the
infections that killed some of the patients and the pump itself led
to blood clots that cause strokes.
   At the University of Utah, which had received one of the NIH
artificial heart research grants, Dr. Donald Olsen told the Atlanta
Constitution that cancellation of the research contracts ``is a
tremendous setback for scientific advancement in the field.''
   Four companies, however, will receive grants for continued study
of the heart assist device, said Lenfant. In addition to Thermedics
of Boston, they are Abiomed of Danvers, Mass., Nimbus Inc. of
Sacramento, Calif., and Novacor of Oakland, Calif.
   Figures on the heart assist device research grants were not
immediately available from NIH, but Wood said his company was
receiving a four-year grant of $6.4 million for testing and $1.2
million for development of subassemblies that would be made
available to the other companies.

   A metal processing plant where a fire killed
one worker and injured nine others had been cited for previous fire
safety problems, according to city fire records.
   The explosion in a metal dust collector at Mineral Met Inc. on
the city's east side Thursday spewed flaming metal chips throughout
an industrial plant, sparking a fire that took three hours to bring
under control. Two of those injured remained in critical condition
today.
   Fire inspectors' reports indicate the company has been cited for
poor fire prevention, including the accumulation of highly
flammable dust and poor dust control.
   The records also show fires in 1984 and 1986 were attributed to
careless smoking in dusty conditions, and a 1976 fire was started
by machinery sparks.
   However, plant manager Keith Edwards told radio station WERE-AM
today, ``In recent years I think we've cooperated very well with
the fire prevention department, and even a couple of them had
commented that they thought we had been doing a good job in recent
years.''
   Twenty-nine employees were inside the plant when the fire
erupted.
   ``The dust collector blew up and spread these flaming metal
chips and debris all over and started the fire,'' said Fire Chief
James McNamee. ``The workers were in the grinding room where this
dust is generated.''
   The most explosive powdered metals, including aluminum and
manganese, were stored away from the fire behind four fire doors
the city ordered installed in 1986.
   Firefighters found the dead worker's body inside the plant after
the blaze was brought under control about noon. Lonall Drake, 32,
of Cleveland, a temporary worker at the plant, was killed in the
explosion, a coroner's spokesman said.
   Businesses near the plant on the city's east side were
evacuated, while firefighters worked to keep the blaze from
spreading to a the warehouse containing the powdered metals.
   Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital spokeswoman Terri Manns
said two men were in critical condition with burns over 30 to 37
percent of their bodies. Four others remained in fair or good
condition at the hospital, she said.
   One person was transferred to an Erie, Pa., with a foot injury
and three others were treated and released at other hospitals.

   Police snipers killed five Sikh militants
in the Golden Temple complex today, and one Sikh militant was
killed trying to escape a police cordon around the holy shrine,
police said.
   Today was the fifth day of a siege of the temple, where a band
of militants was holed up. About 100 Sikh militants remain in the
temple complex, which is surrounded by about 2,500 policemen and
paramilitary troops.
   Punjab state police chief K.P.S. Gill said the militants and the
security forces exchanged fire after sunrise for much of the day.
During the afternoon, police sharpshooters positioned in nearby
buildings killed five militants, Gill said.
   The other militant was killed earlier in the day when a
half-dozen men tried to shoot their way through the security
forces' cordon, he said.
   The government launched its siege Monday after Sikh militants in
the temple complex opened fire on security forces and injured five
officers. No food or other supplies have been allowed into the
temple since then.
   The killings brought the death toll at the complex to at least
27 since Monday. At least five of those killed were civilians
caught in the cross-fire.
   Because any attempt to storm the shrine would almost certainly
spark violent reprisals by Sikhs outraged at the desecration of
their holiest shrine, the siege appears aimed at forcing the
militants into submission or at least containing them. The temple
complex is the foremost stronghold of armed Sikhs who want to
establish a separate Sikh nation in Punjab state.
   The army stormed the complex in June 1984 to oust extremists,
and about 1,200 people were killed. In retaliation, Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   On Thursday, police lifted the curfew in the old, walled city
except for the immediate vicinity of the shrine. People began
returning to the streets today.
   Gill told a news conference six Sikh militants firing AK-47
rifles attempted to storm out of the Golden Temple complex shortly
after midnight.
   Security forces, whose weapons apparently were equipped with
night-vision scopes, returned fire and killed one of the Sikhs. Two
escaped into the city and three retreated into the temple complex,
Gill said. He said that one of the escapees was believed injured.
   Gill said two paramilitary soldiers with the Central Reserve
Police Force were injured in the shootout.
   At daybreak, the bodies of more five men were seen inside the
complex. Gill said they apparently died during overnight exchanges
with security forces.
   Gill said security forces ``control all the dominant features
around the temple.''
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Islam and Hinduism, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in this
northern state.
   The extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in Punjab.
   At least 955 deaths in Punjab state have been blamed on the
extremists so far this year. Most of the victims have been Hindus
or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign.
   The Golden Temple stands toward the western end of the complex
at the center of a large pool. The middle section contains a dining
hall and a large meeting hall, while office buildings are to the
east.

   A man on a 100-minute flight from Seattle to
Reno has apparently become the first person charged with violating
a 3-week-old federal ban on smoking on domestic airline flights of
two hours or less.
   Darryl Seigel, 38, is facing maximum fines totaling $6,000 for
taking a few puffs on a cigarette he admits he smoked while in the
plane's lavatory Thursday.
   Seigel claims he did not purposely break the law but lit up
absent-mindedly when he was in the plane lavatory. ``It was a
honest mistake,'' he said.
   Seigel was detained by Reno Cannon International Airport
security for two hours Thursday at the request of the USAir flight
crew, said airport spokesman Rich Peacock.
   He is accused of smoking on a flight where it is banned, smoking
in the lavatory and tampering with the lavatory smoke detector. The
Federal Aviation Administration could fine him $2,000 for each
alleged violation, Peacock said.
   About 20 minutes into the plane ride, a flight attendant spotted
smoke after Seigel left the lavoratory, asked him if he knew about
the federal law against smoking on certain flights, then informed
him he would be arrested when they landed, according to Peacock.
   The flight attendant had explained the new law to passengers
before the plane took off, he added.
   The federal smoking ban on short flights went into effect April
23.
   Ronald Steele, operations inspector for the federal Flight
Standards District Office in Reno, said he believes Seigel is the
first person to be charged with violating that law.

   The number of AIDS cases jumped at least 72
percent worldwide, with the epidemic concentrated in the Americas
and spread in three distinct geographic patterns, the World Health
Organization reports.
   In a report published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, WHO says 34,913 cases of AIDS had been reported for 1987
as of March 21.
   The report noted that although 1987 reporting was not then
complete, the figure already represented a 72 percent increase over
1986.
   By comparison, the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome increased 92 percent from 1985 to 1986 and 110 percent
from 1984 to 1985.
   Including cases reported since March 21, the global total of
AIDS cases has reached 91,905 in the seven years since the disease
was detected, WHO said today.
   The report came on the eve of a meeting here on how to stop AIDS
from spreading among U.S. school-age youth. More than 100 educators
from across the country were expected to attend the three-day
conference, which begins tonight and is co-sponsored by the CDC and
the National Education Association.
   WHO has reported AIDS cases in 139 countries since 1981.
Thirty-six other countries have told the Geneva-based organization
that they have had no cases.
   The real number is thought to be much higher because reporting
has only just begun in some places, such as some African countries.
   WHO said AIDS reporting indicates ``three broad yet distinct
geographic patterns of transmission:''
   _Regions containing industrialized countries with large numbers
of AIDS cases, such as North America, Western Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and parts of Latin America.
   In these areas, most cases have occurred among homosexual or
bisexual men and among abusers of injectible drugs. Male patients
outnumber females as much as 15 to 1. Heterosexual transmission
accounts for a small, albeit growing, number of cases.
   _Areas of central, eastern and southern Africa and some
Caribbean countries. In these areas, most cases have occurred among
heterosexuals, affecting as many women as men. In some urban areas,
researchers estimate up to 25 percent of the sexually active
population is infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
   _Areas of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and most of the
Pacific. Here, the AIDS virus was apparently not introduced until
the early to middle 1980s, and only small numbers of cases have
been reported. Generally, cases here have occurred among people who
have traveled to AIDS-endemic areas or had sexual contact with
people from such areas, according to WHO.
   The CDC report analyzed 84,256 AIDS cases reported to WHO
through March 21, the latest data available at the time the report
was prepared.
   In the Americas, 42 countries have reported 61,602 cases, or 73
percent of the world's AIDS cases; the United States accounted for
54,233 of those, with 2,325 in Brazil and 1,517 in Canada. (As of
this week, however, the United States has reported 7,363 more cases
to the CDC.)
   Eight other countries in the Americas have reported more than
100 AIDS cases: Haiti, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and
Tobago, the Bahamas, Colombia, Argentina and Venezuela.
   Africa has reported 10,973 cases, second to the Americas.
Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Malawi and Zambia
have each reported more than 500 AIDS cases. More than 70 percent
of Africa's AIDS cases were reported last year. Forty-two African
countries or territories have reported AIDS.
   In Europe, 27 countries or territories have reported 10,616 AIDS
cases, with the largest numbers in France, with 3,073; West
Germany, 1,669; Italy, 1,411; and the United Kingdom, 1,227. The
lowest rates have come from Eastern European countries.
   Oceania has reported 834 AIDS cases, including 758 in Australia,
while Asia has reported only 231 cases.
   While Asia, including the populous countries of China and the
Soviet Union, have reported only a small number of cases, WHO
Director General Halfdan Mahler said last year that some Asian
nations were most vulnerable to an AIDS epidemic because of weak
health-care systems.
   The Soviet Union and China, however, both have ``very great
social structure and social control'' as well as health programs
that could help prevent the spread of AIDS, Mahler said.
   ``But even there they are very, very concerned now to build up
very rapidly a kind of surveillance structure'' to deal with AIDS,
he said.

   The Senate was trying to agree today on a plan
for Navy ships and Air Force planes to become more involved in the
war on drugs, but the Pentagon was resisting the proposals.
   The key dispute involves whether to give the Navy authority to
arrest suspected drug traffickers caught outside the three-mile
limit recognized by the United States, say senators involved in the
effort.
   ``This issue of arrest powers is a very tricky and involved
legal issue,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The military is
very worried about the implications of this and just how it would
work. But we'll be able to work something out, no question.''
   ``The public wants this done,'' said Stevens. ``I get a lot of
people saying to me that we ought to get the military involved in
this, that the military has the power to do something about this.''
   ``The Pentagon isn't too happy about this,'' Stevens said. ``But
they're going to have to get involved. It's a war out there and
it's time for them to join the war.''
   The anti-drug plan was the major unresolved issue as the Senate
worked toward completion of a Pentagon budget bill for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
   The House version of the Pentagon bill, approved by that chamber
Wednesday, ordered President Reagan to have the military
``substantially halt'' the flow of illegal drugs across U.S.
borders.
   Neither of the two main Senate plans goes that far, but whatever
passes the Senate eventually will have to be reconciled with the
House measure during a conference committee.
   One Senate proposal, backed chiefly by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, would have the military
provide logistical help and intelligence, chiefly from Air Force
radar planes, to civilian law enforcement agencies.
   The other, authored by Sens. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., goes beyond the Nunn plan by also giving the
military the authority to arrest suspected drug traffickers on the
high seas.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci spent several hours Thursday
afternoon at the Capitol, discussing the various plans. Carlucci
said earlier this week that he didn't feel the Pentagon should be
involved in law enforcement work.
   D'Amato, asked about the reaction of Pentagon officials to his
plan, said, ``They're not happy. ... They're not doing cartwheels.''
   But Wilson said ``the military is going to have to do more. They
may not be happy, but they'll do what they can.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., agreed. ``Local law enforcement is
being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs. We need to stop it beyond
the borders. Once it gets into the United States, it is
immeasurably more difficult to control.''
   The military is now barred from enforcing civilian laws by the
Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law enacted to halt the practice of
having the Army enforce laws in the post-Civil War southern states.
   That law was amended in 1981 to permit the military to provide
some aid, and U.S. military surveillance information is now passed
along to some civilian agencies. In addition, Coast Guard officials
now travel aboard Navy ships patrolling the Caribbean Sea.
   At the Pentagon on Thursday, chief spokesman Dan Howard said the
military could slow, but not halt, drug trafficking.
   ``We have ample military resources to be able to stop every
aircraft at our border, but in fact that's a much more complex
problem than I think most people realize,'' he said.
   Nunn agreed. He noted that, for example, Pentagon aerial
surveillance is chiefly aimed at relatively high-flying Soviet jets
and bombers, rather than the small, low-flying planes used for drug
trafficking.
   The bill authorizes overall military spending in the next fiscal
year of $299.5 billion. That is the same amount in the House
measure.
   In working on the bill Thursday, the Senate:
   _Killed, 82-13, the latest attempt to have the chamber express a
formal opinion on Reagan's Persian Gulf policy. The plan by Sen.
Brock Adams, D-Wash., would have asked for a detailed plan from
Reagan about his policy in the region, and would have given
Congress 15 days after that to vote on the policy.
   _Killed, 57-39, a proposal to halt most U.S. underground nuclear
testing. The House approved an underground test ban, meaning the
issue will have to be resolved by a conference committee.
Above-ground atomic tests have been outlawed since 1963.
   _Restored, on a 64-32 decision, a ``Buy America'' provision
requiring the Pentagon to purchase U.S.-made products, including
anthracite coal. The Pentagon says it already has a four-year
supply of the coal and doesn't need any more. The ``Buy America''
plan had been stripped out of the bill by the Armed Services
Committee.
   _Rejected, 60-37, an amendment banning any U.S. combat troops in
leftist-ruled Nicaragua or its neighbor, U.S.-backed Honduras. The
troop ban was approved last week by the House, an indication that
lawmakers distrust Reagan's repeated assurances that he has no
intention of using U.S. combat troops against Nicaragua.
   _Killed, 61-36, a proposal to cut spending for the railroad
version of the MX nuclear missile from $700 million to $200 and use
the extra $500 million to buy more non-nuclear weapons. The House
proposes to spend only $100 million for the rail version of the MX.

   Lawmakers agreed today that Japan will pay the
benefits of Japanese employees of the U.S. military.
   The Parliament's House of Councilors approved the measure, which
was a revision of an agreement with the United States in which
Japan agreed to pay half the costs.
   During a visit to Washington in January, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita pledged to increase Japan's contribution to the cost of
maintaining American forces here.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic
Socialist Party, the third-largest opposition party, backed the
agreement, said Sadanori Yajima, a House official. It was opposed
by the Socialist and Communist parties and the No. 2 opposition
Komeito.
   Under the revision, Japan will shoulder up to 100 percent of the
costs of eight types of benefits and allowances of the
approximately 21,000 Japanese now employed at U.S. military bases,
Yajima said.
   The benefits include retirement pay, housing, transportation and
cost of living allowances.
   The workers' basic salary is paid by the United States
government.
   In the earlier five-year agreement which went into effect last
June, Japan agreed to pay 50 percent of those costs, amounting to
an estimated $167 million in fiscal 1988, according to Yajima.
   The revision will boost Japan's share to 100 percent by 1991. It
was prompted by calls from the United States for Japan to increase
its share of the costs in light of the appreciating value of the
yen.
   The measure was approved by the Cabinet and earlier passed the
lower House of Representatives.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo today vetoed legislation
that would have restored the death penalty in New York. It was
Cuomo's sixth veto of the bill, and the 12th consecutive year it
has been blocked by the state's chief executive.
   It was not immediately known if the state Legislature would
attempt to garner the two-thirds vote needed to override Cuomo's
veto. But Assemblyman Vincent Graber, the death penalty's chief
advocate in that chamber, said last week that he didn't have enough
votes to override.
   Cuomo said once again that he would urge the Legislature to pass
his alternative proposal to give life without parole to the state's
most violent criminals.
   ``My opposition to granting to the state the power to execute
this ultimate and violent act of retribution is well-known,'' Cuomo
said. ``If there is a serious interest in enhancing the sanctions
for the most serious crimes, there should be no reason to postpone
enactment of a life without parole statute.''
   Restoration of the death penalty was vetoed six consecutive
years from 1977-82 by Cuomo's predecessor, fellow Democrat Gov.
Hugh Carey, and has been vetoed every year since then by Cuomo.
   The last criminal to die in New York's electric chair was Eddie
Lee Mays in 1963. Federal and state court rulings have since
rendered capital punishment statutes sill on the books in New York
to be unenforceable.
   Death penalty advocates hoped that outrage over three police
officer shootings in New York City so far this year would change
the minds of some legislators opposed to capital punishment. Those
deaths include the execution-style slaying of New York City rookie
officer Edward Byrne, who was killed while guarding a witness in a
drug case.
   An override in the 150-member Democratic-controlled Assembly
would need 100 votes, but the vote on the bill in that house last
week fell eight votes short of that total.
   The Republican-controlled Senate passed the bill 38-17 in
February but sponsor Sen. Dale Volker said he could generate the
three additional votes needed in the 61-member house.
   The legislation would have allowed the death penalty in cases
where an on-duty police officer or prison guard was murdered, when
the murder was committed to prevent a person from testifying at a
criminal proceeding, in murder-for-hire cases or when the defendant
committed murder along with another violent felony such as
kidnapping, rape or robbery.

   U.S. officials said today they are monitoring
a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite that the Tass news agency says
will fall to earth this August or September.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Ccommand, in
Colorado Springs, Colo, said that the satellite, Kosmos 1900, ``has
been in a steadily decaying orbit for the last month. If nothing is
done to correct its orbit, it will decay,'' and reenter earth
atmosphere.
   The official Soviet Tass news agency reported this morning that
Kosmos 1900 has a nuclear power plant aboard, and would fall to
earth in August or September, but that the radioactive material
aboard would not present a danger.
   Neither Tass nor the U.S. spokesman described the mission of
Kosmos 1900, but it is believed to be one of two RORSAT satellites
the Soviets have in orbit to monitor the movement of American
warships. RORSAT is an American designation which stands for Radar
Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite.
   The Tass announcement, made available by the agency's office in
Washington, said that ``the artificial earth satellite Kosmos 1900,
with a nuclear power plant aboard, was launched Dec. 12, 1987.''
   ``According to competent Soviet oranizations, radio contact with
the satellite was lost in April 1988. The satellite is continuing
in its oriented flight, and the main service systems are
functioning according to the program.
   ``The satellite will fly in orbit until August-September 1988,
after which it will cease to exist. The satellite Kosmos 1900 has
systems insuring radiation safety on completion of the flight,''
Tass said.
   The Tass announcement came as a top Soviet space official, Roald
Sagdeyev, and private American scientists urged a ban on nuclear
reactors in earth orbit, a measure designed to block the Reagan
administration's Star Wars program. Such a ban also would end
RORSAT.
   Sagdeyev, director of the Soviet Space Research Institute, told
a news conference that he had been in the United States for several
weeks and had no fresh information on Kosmos 1900.
   The main target of the proposed ban on orbiting reactors,
Sagdeyev and the Americans said, is the U.S. SP-100 program, a
pilot for the orbiting nuclear reactors that many scientists
believe would be needed to power the exotic weapons envisioned in
President Reagan's plans for a space-based missile defense.
   The proposed ban would not apply to nuclear reactors aboard
missions in deep space, such as a manned mission to Mars, Sagdeyev
said.
   But ``an agreement to ban nuclear reactors from orbit would be a
major barrier to any future arms race in space since nuclear
reactors are compact sources of large quantities of power necessary
for many military purposes,'' said a joint statement signed by
Sagdeyev and Frank von Hippel of the Federation of American
Scientists.
   Sagdeyev, an adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has
been at the forefront of Soviet efforts to block the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
   Some administration officials also have credited Sagdeyev and
Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Scientists, with bringing to Gorbachev's attention many U.S.
scientific papers arguing that Star Wars may be an impossible
dream. That perception is thought to have led Gorbachev to soften
his anti-SDI rhetoric at the Washington summit last December.
   Two previous RORSATs have fallen to earth, detailed in a
background paper by Steven Aftergood, a member of the American
group calling for the ban. Aftergood is executive director of the
Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los Angeles organization opposed to
Star Wars.
   In January 1978, Kosmos 954, a RORSAT powered by 110 pounds of
uranium, re-entered the atmosphere and spread radioactive debris
across western Canada.
   The Soviets redesigned the reactors aboard RORSAT so they would
eject their fuel rods as the satellites re-entered the atmosphere,
theoretically burning up the radioactive waste, according to
William E. Burrows, in his book ``Deep Black,'' about spy
satellites.
   One of the newly designed RORSATS dropped from orbit on Jan. 25,
1985, and the reactor is believed to have splashed into the Indian
Ocean.
   Sagdeyev and Von Hippel said the radioactive material aboard
Kosmos 1900 was expected to vaporize on reentry and not fall to
earth.
   Currently, the Soviets have two RORSATS in orbit, Kosmos 1824,
launched last June 18, and Kosmos 1900, launched last Dec. 12,
according to Nicholas Johnson, author of the annual ``Soviet Year
in Space, 1987.''
   While it is not clear how the Soviets would replace the RORSAT
program if they observed a ban on orbiting nuclear reactors,
Johnson believes that they are experimenting with a new type of
ocean surveillance satellite, Kosmos 1818, which behaves
differently than previous Soviet military satellites.
   The power supply and the mission of Kosmos-1818 type satellites
have not been disclosed, although Johnson hypothesizes that they
may be designed to monitor the movement of U.S. warships in the far
north, and may be related to the capability disclosed by Gorbachev
last December to detect nuclear-tipped missiles aboard submarines.

   The prosecutor in the
cocaine-smuggling case of Carlos Lehder Rivas today urged jurors
who have heard seven months of testimony to convict the Colombian
of ``everything ... or nothing.''
   ``In fact, he is guilty of all the counts in the indictment. You
either convict him of everything in this case or convict him of
nothing in this case,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle said in his
final arguments.
   The panel, which is being sequestered, then received
instructions from U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton and began
deliberations.
   The jury must determine whether Lehder was responsible for
smuggling tons of cocaine into this country from his native
Colombia or whether he was victimized by a group of deceitful
American smugglers, as the defense contends.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are charged
with conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine via Lehder's private
Bahamian island, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   In arguments Thursday, Merkle charged that Lehder wore masks
``that have been stripped away by the evidence.''
   Merkle claimed that arguments by defense attorney Edward R.
Shohat were an ``attempt to plant a seed of doubt in your mind that
is not there.''
   The prosecutor challenged the defense's contention that Lehder
was victimized by convicted drug smuggler Ed Ward and members of a
U.S. smuggling organization. ``Ward was just another pilot,''
Merkle said.
   He reserved his harshest comments for Lehder, who has been
depicted by more than 100 government witnesses as a flamboyant,
womanizing neo-Nazi.
   ``This guy has a screw loose, ladies and gentlemen,'' Merkle
said. ``He wasn't playing with a full deck.''
   In a surprise move last week, defense lawyers announced they
would call no witnesses. Shohat concluded his arguments Thursday by
telling jurors to ``do what you feel is right.''
   The jury must not condemn Lehder based on the prosecution's
attacks on his character, said Shohat, but stick to the specific
charges in the indictment.
   ``The issue is not whether Mr. Lehder was good or bad. The issue
in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment,'' said Shohat.
   He ridiculed the government for trying to make it appear that
Lehder, who has been identified as a key figure in Colombia's
violent Medellin cartel, was responsible for this country's drug
problem.
   ``If that is true, you could lock up the doors to this
courthouse and tear down all the `Just Say No,' signs,'' Shohat
said, referring to the national anti-drug campaign.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise. He was arrested near the Colombian
city of Medellin in February 1987 after a shootout, and was
immediately flown to Florida for trial.
   Reed of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with smuggling conspiracy.

   Hours after the superpowers resolved
anti-cheating issues blocking Senate debate on ratifying a nuclear
missile-ban treaty, another hitch emerged, U.S. officials said
today.
   The new dispute kept American and Soviet negotiators up through
the night before it was settled shortly after dawn.
   The disagreement was over the size of canisters that could leave
a Soviet missile assembly plant without being subject to U.S.
inspection.
   ``They are hard bargainers,'' Secretary of State George P.
Shultz told a news conference at NATO headquarters. ``They keep
trying us on for size.''
   He did not accuse the Soviets of bad faith, but said the United
States would remain on guard as the treaty to scrap
intermediate-range missiles is implemented.
   In Geneva on Thursday, Shultz wound up negotiations with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Schevardnadze and declared: ``We feel
all of the issues have been dealt with satisfactorily.''
   But a few hours later, the Soviets teleeftist government reached a
truce
agreement that allows for such aid to the rebels.
   But no deliveries have been made inside Nicaragua because of a
variety of obstacles, including the inability of the two sides to
settle on a mutally acceptable delivery agent.
   The secretary general of the Organization of American States,
Joao Baena Soares, has criticized both deliveries of food to Contra
camps in Honduras and the cash-for-food plan.
   Baena Soares, a member of a verification commission assigned to
ensure compliance with the Contra-Sandinista agreement, has said
that neither plan falls within the limits of what the two sides
have approved.
   But an administration official said earlier this week that the
other member of the commission, Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo, has raised no objections to the cash-for-food plan.
   The administration has accused the Sandinista government of
using delaying tactics during negotiations in a bid to starve the
Contras into submission.
   But Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez said Thursday his
government is willing to allow immediate delivery of humanitarian
supplies to rebels in Nicaragua. He denied that the government is
trying to starve the Contras.
   ``We are in full disposition to accept that the Contra forces
could receive humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua tomorrow, if
possible,'' Ramirez told reporters after a 1{-hour meeting with
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other Democratic
congressional leaders.
   Ramirez did not discuss his views on the cash-for-food plan.
Wright has described the plan as a ``last resort'' because there
are no guarantees the money won't be used to buy weapons.
   AID's position is that the amounts of money involved are too
small to buy many weapons and, in any case, the Contras' highest
priority for the time being is eating.

<TEXT>
   The state Health Department has closed
all but two units of a private, inner-city Philadelphia hospital
where officials say inadequate care might have caused 12 deaths in
the past year.
   The action Thursday followed a three-month investigation at the
James G. Giuffre Medical Center that focused on 66 cases since May
1987. It found 124 deficiencies, including 29 instances of
unnecessary surgery and 55 cases of post-operative complications,
according to department spokesman Gary Froseth. Included in the
allegations was a report that a doctor's unlicensed son had
assisted in surgery. The hospital's namesake and chief executive
officer and his daughter, both licensed physicians, must refrain
from patient care until further investigation by the state.
   ``The hospital will remain closed until they submit a plan of
corrections and we determine those areas cited as deficient have
been corrected,'' Froseth said Thursday. ``When we have done that,
those areas can be reopened.''
   He said no deadline for the plan was set.
   In a statement, hospital officials said many problems already
have been addressed and the officials hope to receive permission to
reopen all units soon.
   ``We are pleased that Giuffre officials have agreed to this
plan,'' Health Secretary N. Mark Richards said. ``We believe a
change in the Giuffre board is the first step in implementing other
changes which will allow the facility to eventually operate in
accordance with departmnent regulations.''
   Richards said the department is willing to work with Giuffre to
ensure that the facility meets proper health-care standards.
Investigators were to return to the hospital today to check reports
that some deficiencies already have been corrected, he said.
   While scrutiny in many patient cases fell on Giuffre, many of
the other problems involved the board of directors, according to
Froseth.
   Under an agreement Giuffre and state officials signed Thursday,
Froseth said Health Department officials expect Giuffre's entire
board of directors to leave immediately. The 15-member board will
be replaced by May 25, Froseth said.
   But Peter D. Carlino, the board's chairman told The Philadelphia
Inquirer Thursday night that the board had agreed only to
``reorganize'' and that some members could remain. He said no
decision had been made yet on whether Giuffre would remain.
   Froseth said the order bans Giuffre and the two other doctors
comprising Allied Surgical Associates _ his daughter, Dr. Adrienne
Giuffre, and Dr. Lee Weissman _ from participation or involvement
in administration, patient care, consultation or other services
until the state has determined that all questions regarding the
group's activities and conduct have been resolved.
   The order allows the hospital's clinic and the drug and alcohol
in-patient services to continue operating. It closes all in-patient
acute care, including surgical services, the emergency room and the
podiatric clinic. Patients already at the hospital, which treats
some of the city's poorest residents, will continue receiving
treatment, Froseth said.
   The hospital's status as a Medicare treatment center also has
been jeopardized, the state said.

   For every superstitious gambler who
plans to avoid casinos on Friday the 13th, it seems just as many
believe they'll hit the jackpot today.
   ``On Friday the 13th, we expect weird players. They get more
excitable,'' said casino pit boss Margaret Miller, who supervises
gambling tables. ``We just hope it's not a full moon on top of
that.''
   But if the portents are unclear for casino gamblers, stock
market players might want to note a University of Miami study that
says the ill-starred day often does bring them bad luck.
   The study, released Thursday by Professors Robert Kolb and
Ricardo Rodriguez, showed that stocks over a 23-year period dropped
on Fridays the 13th at an average annualized rate of 24.5 percent.
That, the professors said, is how much the market would drop in a
year if it dropped as much every day as it did on the unlucky
Fridays.
   The study also showed that on all other Fridays, stocks rose at
an annualized average rate of 27.9 percent.
   The study examined all trading days from 1962-1985, the school
said.
   Most casino employees say Friday will be like any other day
because gamblers routinely do quirky things in pursuit of the big
win.
   Take, for instance, Asian players who ask dealers to remove jade
jewelry.
   ``They believe it brings good luck to those who wear it,'' said
floor person Bill Jarrett, who oversees dealers, monitors betting
and caters to gamblers who bet large sums of money.
   Italian gamblers often sprinkle salt on the table's green felt,
supposedly to ward off evil spirits, said floor person Guy Brady.
   ``You don't say anything and just clean it up later,'' Brady
said.
   One dealer recalled a man who wouldn't settle for just a
rabbit's foot and hid a live rabbit in a paper bag.
   ``Sometimes people rub your hand or touch your arm for good
luck,'' said dealer Jeanne Vercio. Other players, she said, put a
variety of lucky charms on tables, including small plastic
leprechauns, coins and shamrocks.
   Some players place a rosary or place voodoo dolls on their
cards, dealers say.
   Floor person Loretta Sutton said some gamblers get upset if a
dealer changes the colors of their chips to advance them to a
higher denomination.
   ``And a lot of players also don't like pregnant dealers,'' she
said. ``They think the house will win all the time'' because a
pregnant woman is lucky.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal flood insurance program has been
expanded, but coastal residents who want full protection may need
to act before June 1.
   Under the new regulations, insurance coverage will be extended
to coastal buildings subject to ``imminent collapse or subsidence''
as a result of erosion.
   Coverage would provide funds to either relocate or demolish the
structure in imminent danger. Previously, insurance coverage
extended only after damage had occurred.
   However, to obtain this protection the insurance must be in
place by June 1, according to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which oversees the flood insurance programs.
   After that date protection for ``imminent'' collapse will be
available only after insurance has been in place for two years, or
for the full time of ownership if that is less than two years, FEMA
said.
   While FEMA supervises the program, the actual insurance policies
are sold through private local insurance brokers.

<TEXT>
   The head of Czechoslovakia's Roman
Catholic Church has written an unusually tough letter to the
Communist premier saying church-state relations are at the crisis
point and that government policy must be changed.
   In the letter, dated April 23 and made available this week to
emigres in Vienna, Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek told Premier Lubomir
Strougal that police force used to break up a peaceful
demonstration in Bratislava in March showed a new policy of
dialogue is needed.
   ``It has become clear that the contacts between the state and
the church have reached a crisis,'' the letter said. A copy was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``The policy towards the church to date can now only be
continued at the price of using force,'' the 88-year-old primate
wrote. ``Through force, the crisis will not be solved, but deepened.
   ``Catholics are conscious of their rights, they will demand them
and are prepared to make sacrifices,'' the cardinal stressed.
   Relations between the Communist authorities and the Roman
Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia have been strained for years over
the Communists' refusal to allow any bishops to be appointed in the
last 15 years.
   Ten of the country's 13 sees are vacant _ a situation the
cardinal described as ``catastrophic'' _ and the three living
bishops are all over 75.
   Last month, the Vatican and Prague authorities reached agreement
on appointing two auxiliary bishops for the Prague archdiocese and
one titular bishop for Trnava in Slovakia. But these are not full
bishops.
   Increasing anger among believers prompted about 500,000 to sign
a petition organized by a Catholic lay activist last December to
demand more bishops, more priests and an end to harassment of
churchgoers.
   Tomasek gave unprecedented backing to the petition in a letter
to all Roman Catholics on Jan. 4. The state-run media responded
with strong attacks against the cardinal and the organizers of the
petition. Churchgoers in Bratislava and other cities reported
detentions, interrogations or other harassment of believers who
signed or collected signatures.
   About 2,000 Catholics gathered in downtown Bratislava, the
capital of Slovakia, on March 25 to demand religious freedom and
the appointment of more bishops. Police drove street-cleaning
trucks into the crowd to disperse the peaceful rally, then used
water cannons when some protesters didn't leave.
   Czechoslovak dissidents claimed that several demonstrators were
beaten by police.
   In his letter to Strougal, Tomasek stressed that the petition
fully complied with a Czechoslovak law guaranteeing citizens the
right to petition authorities and expect a reply.
   ``I welcomed and supported (this action) because my efforts of
many years at a normal life for the church and for believers had
yielded almost no results,'' Tomasek said.
   He criticized media attacks on the petition and its backers for
what he called a return to the vocabulary of the Stalinist 1950s,
when the Cardinal and thousands of other believers and clergy were
imprisoned.
   ``We demand a change in the position of the state towards the
church,'' Tomasek wrote. ``Let us not go further along the path of
confrontation, but move towards a dialogue.''
   A speech made by a Communist official in Brno last weekend,
however, indicated the party will continue to crack down on
believers.
   South Moravian party chief Vladimir Herman revealed that the
party's ruling Presidium is sending local party cells information
on ``the endeavor of some illegal structures to interfere with our
efforts'' in church-state relations.
   Herman did not specify what ``illegal structures'' he had in
mind.
   He charged these were part of an attempt to revert to a
non-Communist regime and to thwart the party's declared policy of
reform.

<TEXT>
   Nearly three years after he died as a hostage
in Lebanon, William Buckley, a former CIA official in Beirut, was
honored today in a military ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.
   CIA Director William Webster joined the families of four
American hostages now held in Lebanon in remembering Buckley as a
man who loved his country.
   ``Bill did things that none of the rest of us would have done,''
Webster said. ``He lived by example.''
   Webster brought along a letter from President Reagan, which said
that Buckley ``loved the United States. ... He cherished liberty.''
   Buckley, Reagan noted, had been seized in March 1984, by
terrorists who ``tortured him and finally killed him.''
   Buckley died June 3, 1985, in captivity, but his body was never
recovered. He was 58.
   Buckley never married but the ceremony in a shaded valley of the
cemetery near Washington was attended by a longtime friend, Beverly
Surratt of North Reading, Mass., and two sisters, Maureen Moroney
of Salem, Mass., and Joyce Wing of Saugus, Mass., and their
families.
   One of the speakers at the 40-minute ceremony was Peggy Say,
sister of hostage Terry Anderson, who has been held in captivity
longer than any of the other nine Americans.
   Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent,
was captured in March 1985.
   Mrs. Say, who returned from France after seeing former French
hostages on Thursday, said it was important for her to come to the
ceremony.
   Her voice choking with emotion, she said Buckley's family ``have
been there for me for three years.''
   The ceremony, known as a full honors ceremony, included the
drawing of a caisson, the playing of Taps and the firing of three
rifle shots.

   Another man died and at least 14 people were injured when a bomb
exploded Tuesday at the Citibank offices on the third floor of a
12-story building. All the victims were Indians. Citibank is based
in New York.
   Two of the victims were reported in critical condition.
   No one claimed responsiblity for the blast. Police said the bomb
was concealed in a briefcase.
   The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi issued an advisory telling
employees of American companies ``to take security precautions.''

   A Kuwaiti banker paid a record $864,000 for a
single pearl that Napoleon gave to his wife, and jewels of the late
Moslem spiritual leader Aga Khan III sold for $3 million at auction.
   Katharina Feller, a spokeswoman for Christie's auction house,
said the price paid for the Regente pearl Thursday night was more
than double the previous record for a single pearl.
   Napoleon had the pearl set in the center of a tiara for Empress
Marie Louise, his second wife.
   Ms. Feller said the buyer, who did not want to be named, bought
the piece as a birthday present for his sister.
   The Aga Khan collection included a 33-carat pear-shaped diamond.
It fetched about $1.8 million, nearly twice its estimated value. A
brooch and diamond bracelet, both including emeralds with Koran
inscriptions, went for almost $1 million.
   The buyers remained anonymous.
   Of wealthy Iranian descent, the Aga Khan died in 1957 and was
succeeded by his grandson as leader of the Ismaili Moslem faith.

   Swimmers and surfers were allowed
to return today to a five-mile stretch of beach evacuated when a
20-foot great white shark cruised within 20 yards of the shore,
lifeguards said.
   The shark was eventually frightened by a police helicopter sent
to track it and swam out to sea, authorities said.
   About 30 people were ordered from the water in this Orange
County beach town 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles after the
sighting Thursday afternoon, said lifeguard Eric Bauer.
   ``We have verified it as a great white, about a 20-footer,''
Bauer said. The water along the entire 5-mile length of Newport
Beach was evacuated, he said.
   The beach was reopened this morning, said lifeguard Don Stewart.
   The shark was first spotted by the crew of a boat operated by
Vessel Assist, which provides assistance to boaters at sea.
   Bauer said the appearance by a great white in Newport Beach
waters was unusual, noting that ``a couple of years ago we had a
15-foot hammerhead shark, but nothing since.''

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine European nations that profess
neutrality or non-alignment proposed compromise language Friday
that they hope will lead to a final document at the stalled
Helsinki follow-up conference.
   Foreign Minister Alois Mock told reporters the compromise
``contains all the necessary elements of a future concluding
document'' for the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
   The conference began in November 1986. It is one of several
called to review compliance with 1975 Helsinki accords on military
security, economic cooperation and humanitarian issues signed by
the Soviet Union, United States, Canada and all European countries
except Albania.
   Mock, who led the effort by the nine nations, said: ``The draft
offers compromise solutions to those questions which could not be
resolved by the conference up to now.''
   Mock said it includes some ``innovative'' steps to improve
implementation of human rights provisions, including verification
procedures, exchange of information and bilateral meetings to
discuss violations.
   Mock said the compromise provides for a human rights conference
and three follow-up meetings for contined monitoring.
   He said the ``comprehensive and balanced'' proposal resulted
from more than a year of negotiations among Austria, Cyprus,
Finland, Liechtenstein, Malta, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland and
Yugoslavia.
   A spokesman for the U.S. delegation said privately of the
proposal: ``We are definitely not ruling it out.''
   Yuri Kashlev, chief of the Soviet delegation, described it as a
positive step.
   ``It may create all conditions for finishing the meeting in a
couple of months with positive and balanced results,'' he said. ``I
hope we could do that probably by the end of July.''
   Delegates to the Vienna conference have worked since Febrary
1987 on a final document expending upon the original accords.
   Western nations insist that progress on disarmament and military
security be balanced by progress on human rights. The Soviet bloc
accuses the West of holding security issues ``hostage'' to human
rights.
   Some Western delegates criticized the compromise on human rights
grounds, but Mock said:
   ``I don't share the view that the draft falls far short of what
was proposed originally'' by the West. ``It's a compromise paper,
and compromise means that everybody has to give a little bit
compared with the original positions.''

   Police opened fire and wounded at least

port city said Friday.
   About 500 workers had occupied the privately owned Makbulur
Rahman jute mill for three days to demand bonuses to help pay for
an Islamic feast next week, according to officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   On Thursday, the mill owners asked riot police to disperse the
workers. When the police arrived, the workers hurled rocks and
homemade bombs, the officials said. Police then opened fire, the
officials said.
   They said the workers were demanding at least $10 apiece to
celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, a monthlong
period of dawn-to-dusk fasting for Moslems.
   Jute is a strong fiber used for making burlap, sacks, mats and
rope.

<TEXT>
   The magazine Ash-Shiraa said today that
foreign hostages were moved to a less vulnerable prison as
Iranian-backed fighters and pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem rivals clashed
in south Beirut.
   It said the blindfolded hostages were taken last Saturday to the
house of Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin, the spokesman for Hezbollah, or
Party of God, believed to be an umbrella group for kidnappers.
   Hezbollah is battling the Amal militia of Justice Minister Nabih
Berri for control of south Beirut's slums, where many of the 18
foreign hostages were believed to be held.
   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut-based weekly, said the hostages were moved
to al-Amin's house in a relatively safer south Beirut area, but did
not name the neighborhood where the house is located.
   Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
al-Amin's house is in Manshieh Street in the Harek Hreik slum about
50 yards from the residence of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah.
   The weekly, which was the first to report the secret U.S. arms
sales to Iran in November 1986, did not say where in south Beirut
the hostages were imprisoned before they were moved.
   It said the hostages were blindfolded when they were taken to
al-Amin's house in several civlian cars with a heavy militia escort.
   The magazine cited no sources and the report could not be
independently verified. Al-Amin was not available for comment.
Hezbollah's press office in south Beirut's district of Bir el-Abed
did not answer telephone calls.
   Ash-Shiraa has good sources in the Iranian government and among
the Shiite community in Lebanon, but many of its recent reports on
foreign hostages have not panned out.
   Nine Americans are among the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   This week's departure from Vietnam of
22 Amerasians brought to more than 4,000 the number of Amerasians

Bangkok said Friday.
   The 22 children, including one American citizen, arrived in

   They and 58 accompanying family members will spend a few days in
Bangkok before flying to the Bataan refugee processing center in
the Philippines for several months of language study and cultural

   More than 4,000 Amerasians have left Vietnam under the U.S.
Orderly Departure Program since regular processing of Amerasians
began in September 1982, the release said. More than 6,000 family
members have accompanied them, it said.
   The United States and Vietnam have agreed in principle that all
of the remaining Amerasians _ estimated at 8,000-12,000 _ should go
to the United States as quickly as possible.
   The Amerasians were fathered by U.S. servicemen and civilians
during the U.S. intervention in the Vietnam War.

<DATELINE>OZARK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted murderer R. Gene Simmons, who has
asked to be swiftly executed, had hoped for the death penalty from
the outset and mounted a defense only because it was his best
chance to get it, his attorney says.
   ``We got what he wanted,'' defense attorney John C. Harris said.
Simmons, 47, was convicted of capital murder on Thursday and
sentenced to die for gunning down two people in Russellville on
Dec. 28. He still faces charges of killing 14 members of his family
during the Christmas holidays.
   After the jury recommended lethal injection, Simmons shocked
Judge John S. Patterson by publicly forsaking his right to appeal.
   Patterson today set a hearing for Monday to satisfy himself that
Simmons is competent to waive his appeal.
   If he concludes that Simmons is competent, ``I'm going to set an
execution date,'' the judge said.
   ``His mind was made up from the outset. For weeks and months we
have had this bottled up inside of us,'' Simmons' lawyer said
Thursday night.
   In a brief statement read to the court, Simmons asked that his
execution ``be carried out expeditiously. I want no action that
will delay, deny, defer or denounce this very correct and proper
death sentence.''
   Simmons said that in his case, ``anything short of death would
be cruel and unusual punishment. ... I only ask for what I deserve.
Let the torture and suffering in me end. Please allow me the right
to be at peace.''
   Simmons was found guilty of capital murder, five counts of
attempted capital murder and first-degree false imprisonment in
connection with the Dec. 28 shooting spree. The jury deliberated
less than 1{ hours before finding him guilty and another two hours
before recommending the death penalty.
   Patterson, following the recommendation, sentenced Simmons to
die and to 147 years in prison on the other charges.
   Simmons is to stand trial in July in the deaths of his wife,
four daughters, three sons, two spouses of children, three
grandchildren and a child officials said Simmons fathered by his
oldest daughter. All had been shot or strangled. Police found their
bodies when they searched Simmons' home at Dover following his
surrender in Russellville.
   Killed in the Russellville shootings were Kathy Kendrick, 24,
who reportedly had spurned Simmons' advances a year before the
shooting, and James Chaffin, 33, described by police as a chance
victim. Miss Kendrick was shot at the law office where she worked.
Chaffin was shot at an oil company.
   Patterson was not sure whether he had the power to set an
execution date because Arkansas law provides for an automatic
appeal in death sentence cases. Attorney General Steve Clark said
he thought Patterson could set the date.
   As an alternative, Simmons may be required to get a state
Supreme Court order defending his right not to appeal and
compelling Patterson to set an execution date.
   ``If he can waive his appeal, I say let him waive his appeal and
go on with it,'' Prosecutor John Bynum said. However, he added,
``in death-penalty cases, it may be that the interests of the state
are so great that an automatic appeal will run regardless of what
the defendant wants.''
   Simmons didn't plead guilty, Harris said, because ``he felt like
his best chance of getting the death penalty was to vigorously
defend.'' Arkansas law permits a death sentence only upon a jury's
recommendation.
   Simmons' lawyers rested his case without calling a witness.
   Harris said his client ``never intended to survive this
ordeal.'' Simmons intended to take his life after the Russellville
shootings, Harris suggested, but then did not do so ``because of
the trouble he was having killing people. ... He shot seven people
_ only two of them died.''
   Harris said Simmons realized during the shooting spree that he
was failing to kill all the people he was shooting at.
   ``I don't think he knew that much about guns.''

<TEXT>
   Colonial historians want to restore a
five-mile stretch of road where Paul Revere was captured and the
first shots of the American Revolution were fired to the way it
looked circa 1776.
   But people who live along Battle Road don't exactly revere the
idea of reverting the highway to a cow path. ``You call turning a
paved road into dirt progress?'' asked one.
   The section of Route 2A that connects Lexington and Concord is
just another highway to most, but American history buffs consider
it a hallowed site.
   British troops clashed with the Minutemen along the route on
April 19, 1775, in the first battle of the Revolutionary War. The
British captured Paul Revere on the road as they retreated toward
Boston.
   Supporters of a National Parks Service plan to restore Battle
Road include retired House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill and
Thomas Boylston Adams, scion of the family that produced two U.S.
presidents and revolutionary firebrand Samuel Adams.
   O'Neill lives on Cape Cod and Adams lives in Boston.
   ``This is the most important road in America and deserves to be
treated as such,'' the 78-year-old Adams said in a recent
interview, likening Battle Road's significance to already restored
historic sites like the battlefield at Gettysburg.
   But few people living and working along the road share Adams'
enthusiasm, arguing that they may be forced to leave land they've
worked for decades.
   ``We're history, too,'' says Kathleen Cook, whose farm was first
worked by her husband's grandfather.
   ``I don't consider this progress, and most people here agree
with me,'' said Lou Snay, head chef at the Willow Pond Kitchen in
Concord, the last remaining business on Battle Road. ``You call
turning a paved road into dirt progress?''
   Under the Parks Service plan, to be made public May 20, traffic
on most of Battle Road would be rerouted and the segment would be
restored to its original dirt state.
   Trees now crowding much of the unoccupied land along the road
would be cut to recreate the pastures of Revolutionary days. The
crumbled stone walls built by the colonists would be rebuilt to
waist height.
   The Parks Service has overseen restoration of a dozen historic
buildings along the roadway since 1959, after being empowered by
Congress to buy much of the property abutting the highway between
Meriam's Corner in Concord and Route 128 in Lexington.
   More modern stores and houses are being razed under lease terms
that specify state ownership after 25 years or on the death of
elderly owners.
   More than 100 buildings have been torn down since the creation
of Minute Man National Historical Park in 1959, leaving only
several dozen homes still occupied.
   Mrs. Cook said federal officials ``first told us that we could
stay in our homes as long as we wanted to and leave them to our
families ... but then they decided we had to sell.''
   She said the family was told the land would be confiscated if
they didn't.
   ``I probably have seven or eight years left to stay,'' she said,
when asked about her lease. ``I'd like to stay here, but I can't,
so I'm just taking one day at a time.''
   Her 26-year-old son, Peter, gestured from atop his tractor at a
just-plowed field and said, ``They'll keep this like it is. But
they're tearing down our house because it's not old enough. Guess
you can't fight the government, though.''
   Parks Service Chief Ranger Fred Szarka declined to discuss
costs, time schedules and other details of the proposed project
before May 20, but suggested that an alternate roadway might result
in others losing property.
   ``There are people who think it's a terrific idea closing the
road to all vehicles, (but) I think the issue would be whose
backyard it (the new road) is going to go through,'' he said.

   Transplant patient Tabatha Foster will
be buried Monday following services at her family's church, a
funeral director said Friday.
   Willie Mae Elliot, owner of Elliot Mortuary, said the funeral
was scheduled at Oak Grove Baptist Church.
   Tabatha, the world's longest survivor of a five-organ
transplant, died Wednesday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
Doctors said an infection caused her heart, kidney and liver to
fail.
   The girl's mother, Sandra Foster, was choir director at Oak
Grove before leaving to work full-time raising money for medical
bills.
   The girl received a new liver, small intestines, pancreas and
parts of a stomach and colon during an experimental operation that
ended Nov. 1.
   Doctors had to remove almost all of her small bowel three days
after birth because of an intestinal deformity. She was placed on a
highly concentrated liquid diet, which damaged her liver.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ending
rumors that he had died, voted in the final round of Iran's
parliamentary elections Friday. Demonstrators burned effigies of
President Reagan and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd.
   Khomeini cast his vote in a special mobile polling booth outside
his heavily guarded residence in north Tehran's Jamaran suburb soon
after polls opened at 7 a.m.
   The revolutionary patriarch is 87 and rarely leaves his
residence and adjoining mosque. Iranian state-run television,
monitored in Cyprus, showed him casting his ballot.
   Hours earlier, rumors swept the Hong Kong stock market that
Khomeini had died.
   In the first round of voting April 8, 188 of the 270 seats in
the Majlis, or parliament, were elected. Friday's election was to
fill the other 82 electoral districts, including 16 of the 30 in
Tehran, where no candidate got a clear majority last month.
Candidates are elected to four-year terms.
   IRNA said final results would not be known until Tuesday.
   Among the 168 candidates fighting it out in Tehran and other
cities were President Ali Khamenei's brother Hadi, seeking
re-election in the northeastern city of Mashhad. He survived a
grenade attack by leftist guerrillas last year.
   Another was Habibollah Asgar-Owladi, an Islamic zealot jailed
for life during the reign of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi
for involvement in the 1965 assassination of Prime Minister
Hasan-Ali Mansur.
   Asgar-Owladi was freed when Khomeini toppled the shah in 1979.
   IRNA said that Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
received more than 1.3 million votes in April, and other Khomeini
aides cast their votes in Jamaran after the bearded patriarch.
   President Khamenei and Prime Minister Hussein Musavi voted in
south Tehran mosques, which were used as polling stations, IRNA
said.
   They later joined big marches in the capital to mark Qods
(Jerusalem) Day, proclaimed by Khomeini in 1979 to protest Israel's
seizure of the Arab half of the holy city in 1967.
   IRNA reported that millions of men, women and children, chanting
``Death to Israel! Death to America!'' marched through Tehran and
other cities, carrying huge portraits of Khomeini and burning
effigies of Reagan and King Fahd.
   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran last month, citing
``terrorism and subversion.''
   The Parliamentary election is the third since Khomeini's Islamic
revolution toppled the monarchy in 1979.
   The April 8 voting was held amid Iraqi missile and air attacks
on Iranian cities. But both sides in the 7{-year-old war have
observed a cease-fire in the so-called ``war of the cities'' since
April 21.
   Friday's voting took place amid Iran's growing isolation,
deepening economic troubles and major military setbacks in the war.
   These included the loss of the Faw peninsula in southern Iraq _
recaptured by the Iraqis April 18 after two years of Iranian
occupation _ and naval clashes the same day in which the U.S. Navy
sank or crippled six Iranian vessels.
   Radicals and Moslem extremists were expected to widen the
sizeable gains they made in April when several leading
conservatives lost their seats.
   The main election issues have been economic and social reform.
   The radicals seek centralized state control of the economy and a
broad spectrum of reforms.
   The cleric-led conservatives, who favor a strong private sector,
are supported by the ``Bazaaris,'' the weathy merchant class which
has survived the revolution.
   Philip Robbins, an Iran specialist with the Royal Institute of
International affairs in London, said in a telephone interview that
the new Majlis will be ``a far more radical body than it was
before, particularly on the important issue of economic policy.''
   Khomeini, who wants to see his revolution set on a firm course
before he dies, strengthened the radicals' hand before April's poll.
   He delivered a series of edicts widening state powers that
opened the way for reformist legislation vetoed by the 13-member
council and last year disbanded the Islamic Republic Party, the
conservatives' main power base.

   Rescue teams tunneled through tons
of concrete today searching for missing victims after four floors
of a downtown building collapsed. Police said 10 people were killed
and 46 injured.
   About 25 people were believed to be trapped.
   The rubble buried the ground floor offices of a furniture
factory. Authorities said it was not immediately known what caused
the building, whose upper floors were under construction, to
collapse Thursday.
   ``Up to now, we have nine bodies of people who died there who
were identified and one is still without being identified,'' said
first officer Gilberto Sanchez, the radio officer at police
headquarters.
   ``There are about 25 people still missing, believed to be under
the wreckage and debris, but the number is not certain,'' Sanchez
said in a radio interview. He said earlier Red Cross reports that
18 people were killed and 96 injured were wrong.
   Red Cross duty officer Juan Manuel Diaz acknowledged an error in
the Red Cross count.
   Sanchez said troops from the local army garrison had been
brought in to help rescue workers remove debris from the collapsed
building. He said rubble-moving equipment was brought in from as
far away as Salamanca, 78 miles southwest of here.
   Diaz and Juan Jose Navarro Rincon, another police duty officer,
said the furniture factory was operating while the upper floors
were still being built. Both said the building was a reinforced
concrete structure.
   ``From some reports I heard here, they were apparently pouring
fresh concrete when it caved in. Apparently the building did not
resist the weight,'' Navarro Rincon said in a telephone interview.
   Margarito Rodriquez, a spokesman with the Aguascalientes police
department, said construction workers were on each of the floors of
the unfinished structure when it collapsed at about 5 p.m. (7 p.m.
EDT) on Thursday.
   One of the dead was an unidentified boy about 10 years old, said
Esperanza Cardenas, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
   Rescue workers were using specially trained search dogs and
tunnelling equipment to locate any missing people, said Commander
Marco Cerilla, chief of the Aguascalientes police department.
   He said personnel from the Mexican army, national Red Cross
headquarters and federal Public Security department arrived to
coordinate the search effort.
   Aguascalientes, capital of Aguascalientes state, is about 320
miles northwest of Mexico City. Its population is about 500,000.
   Jorge Alberto Castaneda Alvarado, head of the Aguascalientes
Civil Engineers Association, said today that a committee of
engineers and architects was being organized to investigate the
collapse.

   An explosion and fire ripped through
a production unit at a chemical plant today, killing one person and
injuring at least two, authorities said.
   The blast occurred in a building at the American Cyanamid plant
at Willow Island, Pleasants County sheriff's officials said.
   One man was killed and two or three people were injured in the
11:15 a.m. explosion, said Vane Deem of the Belmont Volunteer Fire
Department.
   The fire was contained by shortly after noon, according to the
sheriff's department.
   A department spokeswoman said she did not know what material had
exploded.
   ``They make all kinds of things down there. I'm not sure what
was involved,'' said the woman, who would not give her name.

   Moslem demonstrators chanting against Israel
and for a Palestinian homeland paraded past the White House and
through the center of Washington Friday.
   More than 1,000 men, women and children were in the throng,
carrying large banners, some with photographs of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary leader.
   The demonstration occurred on the last Friday of the Islamic
holy month of Ramadan. Various Palestinian, Pakistani, Iranian and
other groups, including students, took part.
   Participants with portable loudspeakers led the orderly paraders
in chants such as ``Cancer of the Middle East, Israel must not
exist,'' ``Israel is the hate state,'' ``Superpowers are the same.
Down with all of them,'' ``Zionism is terrorism'' and ``Stop the
Holy Land holocaust.''
   Some of the banners protested U.S. support of Israel and
denounced Israel and South Africa as ``twin racist regimes.''

   Riot police stormed the sacred Temple Mount
complex Friday and fired rubber bullets at protesting Moslems on
the final Sabbath of the holy month of Ramadan. Twenty Arabs and
three policemen were reported injured.
   Soldiers closed off large parts of the occupied territories, and
the turnout for Moslem prayer services was drastically reduced. The
army, fearing violence, sealed off the Gaza Strip and turned back
West Bank Arabs at roadblocks into Jerusalem.
   As an army helicopter buzzed overhead and police snipers perched
on rooftops, about 1,000 worshipers emerged from prayers and
marched around the mosques on the city's Temple Mount, or Haram Al
Sharif (Noble Enclosure) in Arabic.
   ``Jews out!'' the marchers chanted. ``We don't want to see any
Zionists!'' Others cried: ``No fear! No fear! The stone is better
than the Kalashnikov (rifle)!''
   The marchers burned Israeli flags and raised the outlawed red,
green, black and white Palestinian flag. Israel radio said a U.S.
flag was set afire.
   A few hundred youths threw stones at the police station that
faces the Al Aqsa mosque, which is at the Temple Mount. Seconds
later, about 100 police wearing riot helmets and carrying clubs and
assault rifles charged the complex, firing rubber bullets into the
crowd.
   Some witnesses said they heard brief bursts of automatic
gunfire, apparently fired in the air.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said three policeman were slightly
injured by stones during the melee. Doctors at Jerusalem's Mukassed
and Augusta Victoria hospitals said they treated 20 Arabs for
rubber bullet injuries.
   Ten injured worshipers were across the mosque complex on
stretchers. One of them, an elderly man, had blood streaming down
his face. He shouted ``Allahu Akhbar!'' (``God is Great!'') and
flashed a victory sign.
   Four or five women, their heads covered in white religious
scarves, also were carried out on stretchers.
   Some witnesses said they saw Arabs throw shoes at police from
large piles at the mosque entrance. The wearing of shoes is
forbidden in mosques.
   As police and demonstrators clashed, many worshipers remained
inside the Al Aqsa mosque, afraid to leave. The Moslem prayer
leader appealed to police through loudspeakers to withdraw.
   ``Go away!'' prayer leader Mohammed Hussein called out. ``Allow
the Moslems to leave peacefully.''
   The prayer services took place amid strict security precautions
that prevented thousands of worshipers from reaching Jerusalem as
Ramadan came to a close. Ramadan, a month of dawn-to-dusk fasting,
is due to end Monday or Tuesday with the sighting of the new moon.
   Last year, an estimated 200,000 worshipers came to the city from
the West Bank, Gaza and Arab towns in Israel, said Hashem Ashayer,
head of Jerusalem's Islamic Council. Estimates of Friday's crowd
ranged from 5,000 to 10,000.
   The army, meanwhile, said 300 Palestinians were being released
from West Bank prisons Friday in a holiday gesture. A spokesman
said the prisoners were chosen from areas that had been calm
recently.
   But the government imposed restrictions on Palestinians starting
Thursday night to thwart possible violence on the ``Night of
Fate,'' marking the revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book, to
the prophet Mohammed.
   Police Commissioner David Kraus said 3,300 policemen were
deployed in Jerusalem to maintain order.
   The army also clamped curfews Friday morning on 120,000
Palestinians in Nablus, the largest West Bank city, and neighboring
refugee camps.
   Curfews were clamped on parts of Gaza City and the Dheishe
refugee camp near Bethlehem.
   The army later lifted the curfew in Gaza City, but the entire
coastal strip, home to 650,000 Palestinians, remained sealed off.
The West Bank city of Ramallah, home to 40,000, also was declared a
closed military area.
   Arab reporters in Gaza City said the army prevented worshipers
from entering the El Salam mosque there Friday and that troops were
stationed around most of the mosques in the Gaza Strip.
   Along the 10-mile stretch of road between Bethlehem and
Jerusalem, police and soldiers set up three roadblocks and were
seen turning back cars with blue West Bank license plates.
   Authorities have expressed concern about violence over the
weekend and during the Id El Fitr holiday, which follows Ramadan.
   Officials also said trouble may erupt Sunday, the 40th
anniversary of the founding of Israel. It is also Jerusalem Day,
the anniverary of the capture of Arab east Jerusalem in 1967.
   A total of 187 Palestinians have been killed since the beginning
of the Arab uprising Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a teen-age girl
have also died.

<HEAD>IRS Loosens 1986 Restrictions on Deductions for Artists, Writers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service on Friday gave
writers, painters and other artists a partial exemption from a
provision in the 1986 tax law that had severely restricted
deduction of expenses of creating their works.
   The IRS said artists will be allowed to write off operating
expenses over three years, with a 50 percent deduction permitted in
the first year and 25 percent in each of the next two. The rule
will apply, the IRS said, only ``where the personal efforts of the
individual are mainly responsible for the creation of a work of
art.''
   The change will allow artists to deduct expenses even before a
book or other artwork begins producing income. It also will free
artists from a significant amount of recordkeeping and paperwork.
   ``It certainly alleviates the complexity concern these people
have had,'' Tom Evans, a tax counsel for the Treasury Department,
told reporters. He predicted the ruling will have little effect on
government tax collections.
   Bills pending in Congress would go even further than the relief
provided by the IRS. They would allow artists to deduct all
creative expenses in the year incurred.
   Best-selling biographer Kitty Kelley, a leader in the fight to
overturn the 1986 provision, was less than cheered by Friday's
ruling. ``But I guess 50 percent is better than nothing,'' she said.
   Ms. Kelley spent four years working on a biography of Frank
Sinatra and recalled that under the pre-1986 law, she was able to
deduct travel, copying, government information and similar research
expenses each year. ``Now I am working on a Nancy Reagan book and
before today's ruling, I wouldn't be able to deduct anything until
after that book is published,'' she said.
   ``I'm fairly established, but the young writers won't be able to
stay in business long enough to get their books published,'' she
said. ``I wonder whether Mark Twain, Faulkner or O'Neill would have
produced what they did if they had had to operate under these
rules.''
   A provision in the giant 1986 tax overhaul was designed so most
taxpayers would be subject to a basically uniform set of
requirements for capitalizing, or writing off, certain expenses.
The catchall change, designed to produce about $35 billion in
revenue over five years, generally subjected artists to the same
capitalization requirements affecting a large retailer or
manufacturer.
   The 1986 law allowed artists to deduct creative expenses only
after the work produces income. That, in turn, required an artist
to forecast how much income a work of art would produce in the
future. In cases when an artist was working on two or more creative
projects simultaneously, it required that expenses be split among
the projects.
   Thus, a writer working simultaneously on a book and a magazine
story, for example, would have to account separately for the
expenses associated with the two projects. No expenses of creating
the works, including research-related travel and costs of an
assistant, could be deducted until the projects earned money.
   Free-lance writers, authors, photographers, painters, sculptors
and other artists banded together to protest, claiming the
paperwork was an undue burden and that many would have to give up
their careers, since often many years pass before a work of art
creates income.
   The IRS said the option is available for artistic expenses
incurred in 1987. A person who already has filed a tax return using
the tougher law may file an amended return.
   The option may be used by taxpayers who incur production
expenses associated with films, recordings, books, photos,
paintings, sculptures and other fine-art products. Jewelry is
specifically excluded.
   Eligible expenses include business travel, depreciation,
equipment rental and repair, labor and office overhead.
   In most cases, an artist whose creative output is sold in the
same year it is produced likely would not excercise the option
outlined Friday. That artist probably would continue writing off
all expenses in the year they are incurred.

   The NATO allies told Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on Friday that settlement of technical disputes
over the U.S.-Soviet arms treaty should spur the Senate to ratify
it before the superpower leaders meet in Moscow.
   ``We think the way is now open for the treaty to be ratified''
before President Reagan meets Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
May 29, said David Mellor, a British minister of state.
   American and allied officials have expressed concern that
failure to ratify the treaty before the summit could spoil the
atmosphere in Moscow and set back efforts to reach other arms
control deals. Reagan and Gorbachev signed the pact in Washington
in December.
   Shultz briefed allied officials on his two days of talks in
Geneva with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. In
Geneva, the two sides resolved differences over how to ensure
compliance with the treaty.
   A further dispute arose after Shultz and Shevardnadze had
pronounced the problems resolved, and lower-level officials on both
sides argued through the night before settling the matter shortly
after dawn.
   Shultz told reporters he was pleased with the outcome, but he
declined to say whether he thought the Senate would be satisfied.
The Senate on Monday postponed debate on the treaty after some
members accused Moscow of backsliding and leaving loopholes for
possible cheating.
   ``All the issues that anyone has raised have been squared
away,'' Shultz told a news conference before flying back to
Washington.
   ``It is the unanimous view of the allies that ratification prior
to the summit is very desireable from their standpoint,'' Shultz
said, adding that this view was made clear in his meeting at NATO.
   The treaty calls for elimination of the superpowers'
medium-range land-based nuclear missiles, which have ranges of 310
to 3,100 miles.
   Shultz also told allied officials, in a closed meeting at North
Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters, that there was no chance
of the superpowers concluding before the Moscow summit a Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks, or START, treaty cutting long-range missiles
by half.
   He and Shevardnadze told reporters the same thing Thursday.
   Mellor said Shultz had given NATO allies ``no further insights''
into how long it might take to wrap up a START agreement.
   Shevardnadze flew to East Berlin on Friday to brief Warsaw Pact
leaders and East German leader Erich Honecker on the talks. East
Germany's state-run ADN news agency said Shevardnadze told Honecker
he was optimistic the superpowers would achieve ``substantial
results'' in reducing strategic weapons at the Moscow summit.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, told
reporters that his government's central concern was that the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty being considered
by the Senate be ratified and implemented.
   Genscher said the importance of the INF deal went beyond
security considerations.
   ``It is also a significant contribution to unity, firmness and
cohesion of the Western alliance,'' he said.
   The bulk of the missiles to be eliminated by the INF treaty are
based in West Germany. The others are in Britain, Belgium and
Italy. No weapons that would be affected by a START accord are
based in Western Europe.
   Shultz told reporters he was not troubled by the emergence of
unexpected disputes with the Soviets over INF treaty provisions on
compliance.
   ``They're hard bargainers, and I guess they keep trying us on
for size to see if we will let go of things that we thing are
important ... and so we, I think, simply need to follow the
practice of sticking to our positions when we believe our positions
are right,'' he said.
   The dispute that erupted in Geneva on Thursday night centered on
the question of the size of canisters that could leave a Soviet
missile assembly plant at Votkinsk without being subject to U.S.
inspection.
   The Soviets wanted to increase the allowable length to 67.7
feet, but in the end both sides agreed on 46.2 feet, an increase of
26.4 inches, a U.S. official said.
   The United States was concerned about missile parts possibly
being illegally shipped from the plant in canisters, according to
the U.S. official, who discussed the matter on condition he not be
identified.

   The Soviet foreign minister expressed optimism
Friday that ``substantial results'' in reducing long-range nuclear
weapons will be achieved at the superpower summit, the official
East German news agency reported.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze briefed President Erich Honecker and the
other Warsaw Pact foreign ministers on two days of talks in Geneva
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   On Thursday, he and Shultz said it would not be possible for
President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign a treaty on
long-range, or strategic, arms at the summit scheduled for May
29-June 2 in Moscow.
   The news agency, ADN, said: ``Eduard Shevardnadze came away
(from Geneva) with the impression that progress and substantial
results can be made at the Moscow summit in all areas that have
been under discussion.''
   It said Shevardnadze told Honecker ``there is the determination
on both sides to cut in half the number of strategic nuclear
weapons, as has been agreed in principle. Intensive work is being
done in this regard.''
   ADN added that Shevardnadze told Honecker the Kremlin is aware
that ``results are expected from the Moscow summit which would give
the process of disarmament and detente a new impulse.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Shevardnadze met with Honecker soon after his arrival, then
briefed the foreign ministers.
   A communique issued by the ministers said they ``gave their full
support to the Soviet Union's efforts in negotiations with the
United States, and voiced hope that the talks between Gorbachev and
Reagan will result in the halving of strategic offensive weapons
and achieve results in other disarmament areas.''
   After the Geneva talks, Shultz said he and Shevardnadze resolved
a dispute over verification procedures for a treaty eliminating
intermediate-range nuclear missiles. It was signed in December but
has yet to be ratified by the Senate.
   Foreign Minister Ioan Totu of Romania did not attend the
briefing, an East German Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding:
``I don't know why he decided not to come.'' Romania was
represented by its ambassador, Gheorge Caranfil.
   Shultz met with NATO foreign ministers Friday in Brussels.
   He told the allied officials, in a closed meeting at North
Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters, that there was no chance
of the superpowers concluding before the Moscow summit a treaty
cutting long-range missiles by half.
   David Mellor, a British minister of state, said Shultz had given
NATO allies ``no further insights'' into how long it might take to
wrap up such an agreement.

   A Hong Kong magistrate sentenced 67 illegal
immigrants from China to jail Friday under a new government policy
to prosecute such offenders before returning them to China.
   Sixty-six of the defendants entered this British colony
illegally for the first time and received jail terms of 15 months.
The remaining defendant, who was caught for the second time, was
sentenced to 18 months. They are to be returned to China after
serving the time.
   The illegal immigrants pleaded guilty to the charge of staying
illegally in Hong Kong. Maximum penalty for the offense is a fine
of $625 and three years imprisonment.
   The government introduced the new policy in an attempt to stem
the flow of such illegal immigrants. Previously, illegal immigrants
were immediately repatriated.
   According to police figures, 2,704 illegal Chinese immigrants
entered Hong Kong in April, compared to 1,694 in the same month
last year.

   A police officer held hostage in a motel
room by two robbery suspects escaped unharmed today after seizing a
gun and shooting at least one of his captors, police said.
   Both suspects were later found dead in the room, said police
spokesman Henry Groepper.
   The hostage officer, Larry Strayer, fired about five shots
inside the room before fleeing shortly before 4 a.m., eight hours
after the hostage incident began, said Groepper. Strayer was
investigating a supermarket robbery when he was taken captive,
police said.
   About two hours later, with the men still holed up in the room,
five gunshots were heard. Police drove an armored truck into the
motel courtyard, and more gunfire followed.
   Police later fired tear gas into the motel room, but the men did
not emerge, Groepper said. When police broke down the door and
entered the room, they found the men's bodies.
   Groepper said he didn't know whether the men had died from
gunshot wounds nor did he know whether the deaths were
self-inflicted. There was no exchange of shots between the men and
police stationed outside the room in the motel's parking lot, who
only fired the tear gas, he said.
   Authorities had blocked off all lanes of Interstate 5 and Barbur
Boulevard, a major roadway, causing a massive traffic tieup several
miles southwest of downtown Portland during the morning rush hour.
   The two men had threatened to kill the officer unless
authorities met their demands for drugs and safe passage out of the
motel. Groepper said no drugs were given the men.
   Strayer said over his radio while he was held hostage that the
suspects had threatened to kill him.
   ``Please get me out of here,'' he said during the standoff.
``They indicated this is the last time I can talk on the radio. If
anybody rushes the door I'm dead.''
   Late-night television news reports, broadcast live from a nearby
parking lot, irritated the suspects, and Groepper asked television
reporters to play down the story.
   With the officer inside acting as an intermediary, police
negotiators talked with the suspects on the telephone and over the
police radio.``On the radio he sounds like he's doing real well,''
Groepper said.
   Police said the gunmen were asking for Dilaudid, a form of
morphine used in cough syrup.
   Strayer was taken hostage while he was investigating a robbery
that occurred about 7 p.m. at a Safeway store.
   About an hour after the robbery, the officer was checking a tip
that two suspicious men were staying at the nearby Portland Rose
Motel. He was admitted to a room at the motel by one man.
   Groepper said other officers brought witnesses from the store
robbery who identified the man as a suspect, but as the officers
were handcuffing the suspect, another man emerged from the bathroom
and pointed at gun at police.
   ``Don't anyone do anything foolish,'' Groepper quoted the man as
saying.
   He said the gunman took Strayer hostage and forced the others
out of the motel room.
   The suspects set one deadline for delivery of the drugs they
requested, but it passed at about 9:15 p.m. and they continued
negotiating with police, Groepper said.

   North Korea's official news agency on Friday denied
Japanese allegations that Pyongyang helped a Japanese terrorist
return to Japan.
   ``The Japanese authorities are hurling groundless slanders at
our republic,'' the Korean Central News Agency said,
   Japanese police arrested Yasuhiro Shibata, 34, near his Tokyo
apartment last Friday after identifying him as one of nine alleged
Red Army members who commandeered a Japan Air Lines Boeing 727 to
North Korea with 129 people aboard in 1970.
   After the hijacking, the nine stayed in North Korea, and
Japanese police and Foreign Ministry officials said Shibata's
return could only have taken place with the approval of the North
Korean government.
   ``It is a well known fact that several Japanese youths belonging
to the Red Army group came to our country in the incident of the
JAL plane,'' the news agency said in a report monitored in Tokyo.
   ``As they entered the territory of our country, the (North
Korean) government only provided them conveniences for their life
and treated them as foreigners from the humanitarian stand,'' the
news agency reported.
   ``As for their going outside the (North Korean) boundary, we did
not mind where they went, regarding it as their right proceeding
from their free will.''
   The news agency charged the Japanese government is trying to
shift the responsibility for the hijacking to North Korea, even
though ``the Japanese government is to blame.''
   It also said Shibata may have wanted to return to Japan because
he was homesick.

   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan says that in the confusion following the 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan he erroneously told Cabinet members
that presidential press secretary James Brady had died.
   The president, Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy J. McCarthy
and a Washington police officer, Thomas K. Delahanty, were wounded
in the assassination attempt outside the Washington Hilton.
   John W. Hinckley Jr. was arrested but was found innocent by
reason of insanity. He is in St. Elizabeths Hospital, a mental
institution in Washington.
   There were erroneous news reports at the time that Brady had
died.
   In his new book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington,'' Regan, who was secretary of the treasury at the time
of the attempt on Reagan's life, included what he said were notes
that he made a few days after the March 30, 1981, shooting.
   He said in the notes that he received information from the
Secret Service, which is part of the Treasury Department, and
relayed it to other members of the Cabinet gathered in the White
House Situation Room.
   ``An unfortunate message came to me from the Secret Service, and
it caused confusion and consternation,'' Regan said. ``At the end
of a message describing the president's condition, someone had
added the words `Brady died.' I announced this sad news to a
stunned group.''
   He said Richard Allen, the president's national security
adviser, asked for a moment of silent prayer.
   ``Apparently someone relayed this information to the group at
the hospital and we got word back that it was not true,'' Regan
said.
   In his book, ``Speaking Out: Inside the Reagan White House,''
former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes gives substantially the
same account and adds that Regan relayed the word to Howard Baker,
then the Senate majority leader and now the White House chief of
staff, at his Senate office.

<TEXT>
   Astrologers, UFO buffs, health
enthusiasts and other assorted New Age advocates, apparently
undaunted that the calendar read Friday the 13th, converged for the
Whole Life Expo.
   About 40,000 people were expected at the Pasadena Convention
Center for the three-day event, featuring 200 speakers who will wax
loquacious on such topics as ``The Magic World of Crystals,'' ``The
Feminine Warrior: Embracing the Goddess,'' ``Channeling: A New Way
of Looking at Reality'' and ``Tibetan Gongs, Singing Bowls &
Voices.'' A panel discussion on UFOs also is scheduled.
   Convention-goers can snack on blue-green algae, tofu shakes and
meatless hot dogs as they stroll among exhibits on spiritual
healing, numerology, fire-walking and colon cleansing.
   Celebrity guests include Michelle Phillips, Susan Strasberg and
Timothy Leary.
   Uri Geller, the psychic guru best known for his purported
ability to twist spoons mentally, will take the stage, as will
Elizabeth Clare Prophet, a Montana-based religious group's leader
who will lecture on the lost years of Jesus.
   The expo, first held in 1978, is sponsored by tofu maker
Mori-Nu, a company called Naked Juice and Whole Life Times magazine.
   ``It's a show about health and awareness,'' said Brian Duggan,
president of Teamwork Promotions, the concern managing the Whole
Life Expo. ``Our goal is to provide a variety of viewpoints and
choices. There seems to be a willingness for more people to try
this. I think people want more fulfillment in their lives.
   ``The fact that so many people are interested and ga-ga over
Nancy Reagan and astrology shows just what an interest there is in
this.''
   He said more people are attending the expo each year. And he
pointed to the expo's more conventional seminars on AIDS awareness,
health insurance, clean water processing and business.
   ``You can find places in any city where you can buy health foods
and buy New Age music,'' Duggan said. ``It's not just a
California-weirdo phenomenon. It's part of mainstream society.''

<TEXT>
   Police sharpshooters firing from high
vantage points killed five Sikh militants inside the Golden Temple
compound Friday and tightened their siege, taking over about
one-third of the sacred complex.
   About 100 extremists in the temple grounds, the holiest shrine
of Sikhism, rejected a government demand for surrender.
   Twenty-seven people, including at least five civilians, have
been killed since Monday, when 2,500 police and paramilitary
troopers surrounded the Golden Temple and its walled compound.
   The gunmen inside are part of a separatist movement that has
waged a terror campaign since 1982 seeking an independent Sikh
homeland in Punjab, a rich northern agricultural state where the
sect has a majority. Thousands of people have been killed.
   K.P.S. Gill, police chief of Amritsar, said government forces
took control of a narrow road that runs through the complex and
seized the temple offices and hostel. The complex covers the
equivalent of about five city blocks.
   The temple offices and hostel are on one side of the road and
the temple, its residential quarters and the dining hall are on the
other.
   Gill said police and troopers controlled ``all dominant
features'' around the compound, including a 150-foot water tower
with a sweeping view over the walls, which are 20 feet high.
   No food or people have been allowed into the temple since the
siege began, and the militants have let no one leave since Tuesday,
when about 800 pilgrims were evacuated.
   Some civilians remained in the compound Friday but no estimate
of their number was available.
   Government forces and the gunmen inside exchanged intermittent
fire during the day, then police announced over a loudspeaker at 4
p.m. that they would stop shooting so women and children could come
out.
   Sarabjeet Singh, deputy police commissioner, said the response
was four shots, apparently fired into the air. He said a Sikh
gunman was guarding the main gate to keep anyone from leaving.
   The siege began Monday after Sikhs inside shot at paramilitary
forces outside the complex, wounding five officers. The
400-year-old Golden Temple is the political and military center of
the Sikh militants.
   Killings by the separatists have increased dramatically in
recent months. At least 955 people have been killed in Punjab so
far this year compared with 1,032 in all of 1987.
   If the government storms the Golden Temple, it risks the wrath
of many moderate Sikhs who would consider the action a desecration
of holy ground.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent soldiers into the temple in
1984 to dislodge militants, and about 1,200 people, most of them
Sikhs, were killed. Five months later Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated
by her own Sikh bodyguards.
   On Friday, at least three companies of Black Cat commandos from
the National Security Guard joined police and paramilitary troopers
at the temple, a police officer reported.
   He said the three companies, totaling about 270 men, had
submachine guns and the kind of drills used to bore through walls.
Some had rifles equipped with night-vision scopes, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Soon after midnight, half a dozen Sikhs tried to shoot their way
out of the temple complex, according to Gill, the police chief. He
said one was killed, two escaped and the others apparently
retreated inside.
   How long the militants' ammunition and food would last was not
known, but they keep large supplies of both on the grounds.
   Reporters allowed into the compound Wednesday saw many
containers of water. The temple also is surrounded by a vast pool
in which pilgrims immerse themselves.
   Sikhs, whose men can be recognized by their turbans and beards,
make up only 2 percent of India's 800 million people and Punjab is
the only state with a Sikh majority.
   They claim discrimination by Hindus, who account for 82 percent
of the population. Sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam.

   Friday the 13th did not begin well for Gov.
Ted Schwinden. His first appointment was with a goat.
   The animal's presence in the gubernatorial office launched the
annual fund-raising project by Helena's Big Brothers and Sisters
program.
   The goat, dubbed ``Half-Pint'' and accompanied by his own
paper-lined box to prevent public indiscretions, was sent to
Schwinden by Jonas Rosenthal, a former aide and one-time director
of Big Brothers and Sisters in Bozeman.
   As with each recipient of the goat throughout the day, Schwinden
had two choices _ either baby-sit the unpredictable animal for an
hour or offer a $10 contribution to send him to someone else.
   Schwinden wasted little time in choosing Half-Pint's destination
_ Highway Department Director Gary Wicks, who is known as a
jokester himself.
   ``I'd love watching dust shake lose from Wicks' $10,'' Schwinden
said gleefully. ``Wicks doesn't like to pay for anything.''
   A certificate sent along with the goat calls for the sender to
identify himself from several categories: friend, associate,
employee, archrival or detested enemy. Schwinden settled on ``none
of the above'' and bid Half-Pint goodbye.

   For Kermit and Beatrice Shelton Friday the
13th is a lucky day and always has been.
   The Sheltons were both born on Friday the 13th _ he in March
1914 and she in April 1917. They got married on Friday the 13th in
May 1938. And 50 years later, they celebrated their golden wedding
anniversary on Friday the 13th.
   ``I never thought about the 50th anniversary being on a Friday
the 13th,'' said Shelton, a retired government employee who
continues to work in real estate.
   ``I never thought about being here for the 50th,'' he admitted.
   The couple have always gone out of their way to flout
superstition.
   There were 13 in their wedding party, and each year they have
tried to get the number 13 included in their automobile license
plates. But they balked at friends' suggestion that they have 13
children.
   ``I had one and she's worth 13,'' said Mrs. Shelton.

   A USA Today reporter who once described
Lincoln as a polyester-loving town was given a grand tour of the
capital that left her feeling, in her words, ``polysaturated.''
   Karen S. Peterson, in a May 3 article in her newspaper, called
Lincoln ``the edge of nowhere, a city still comfortable with
fulsome waistlines and polyester.''
   That struck a chord with two radio personalities and Rita
Bennett of the city's visitor and convention bureau, who organized
a drive to collect polyester clothing to send to the reporter.
Things snowballed, and 10,000 pounds of polyester clothing were
collected in two days.
   Peterson was invited to Lincoln from her home base in Arlington,
Va., and on Thursday she was serenaded at lunch at the Cornhusker
by Attorney General Bob Spire, engineered the train at the
Children's Zoo, and received an admiralship in the Nebraska Navy by
Bill Orr, husband of the governor.
   Peterson, interviewed by a flock of reporters, said she meant no
harm by her sentence and was just trying to set the scene on a
story about Cliff Hillegass. The founder of Cliffs Notes prefers to
run his publishing dynasty from Lincoln rather than New York City.
   Although the bales of polyester clothing will be donated to
charity, Peterson retained one souvenir _ a neon green, textured
polyester double-knit vest with metal buttons.
   ``It's a classic,'' she said.

   Senate leaders voiced optimism today that the
anti-cheating arms control bargain struck by U.S. and Soviet
negotiators at Geneva will remove the final roadblock delaying
debate and ratification of the medium-range missile treaty.
   Senate Majority leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said debate
could begin early next week, after a trio of Senate committees
examine the agreements and formally approve them.
   ``They are the experts in their fields,'' Byrd said.
   Commenting after a 90-minute luncheon briefing by National
Security Adviser Colin Powell, Byrd said Senate leaders were told
the agreement was significant and ``enhances the national security
of this country.''
   ``The briefing was positive and good,'' Byrd said.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it is clear
Byrd's decision last week to postpone action on the treaty while
negotiators addressed concerns that the Soviets were backing away
from effective implementation of inspection provisions ``played a
very constructive role.''
   ``It did make a difference,'' Dole said.
   Several other senators who attended the briefing also said the
results of the Geneva talks between Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze do seem
positive and constructive.
   ``Im optimistic we can move ahead,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``I think at this moment there is more optimism for the passage
of this treaty than at at any other time during this long
process,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking GOP member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Warner said that it appears the Soviets agreed to change their
position on all issues raised by the U.S. side.
   ``I'm confident my colleagues on Monday will come to a similar
conclusion,'' Warner said.
   Some senators said there is now at least a possibility that the
Senate will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the time
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev convene
their Moscow summit on May 29.
   Since most vote counts show overwhelming Senate support for the
pact, the leading question is whether Reagan will have a ratified
treaty in hand as incentive for the two superpowers to make further
progress on arms reduction.
   Byrd said the treaty is too important to national security for
either him or the Senate to be ``driven by artificial, automatic,
arbitrary calendar deadlines.''
   Byrd said he will try to push the treaty through the Senate as
quickly as possible once debate opens but will not guarantee that
can be done before the summit.
   He said he will not permit debate to begin until the on-site
inspection plan worked out in Geneva is examined and approved by
the Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence committees.
   ``We were told all the I's were dotted and all the T's were
crossed,'' Byrd said of the Reagan administration's position on the
treaty before the latest furor.
   ``It was through the examination of these committees that it was
found that this was not the case,'' he said.
   ``If we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have been
hoodwinked or outsmarted, then you can kiss the next arms treaty
goodbye,'' Byrd said. ``Let's do this thing right.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said Shultz will testify before that panel Monday
afternoon with the Senate's bipartisan leadership and the chairmen
and ranking GOP members of the two other committees invited to
participate.
   Pell said that if no further snags are uncovered, Senate debate
could open Tuesday.
   Earlier this week, Byrd postponed action on the new treaty until
Shultz and Shevardnadze resolved a serious dispute over the
implementation of anti-cheating provisions.
   The dispute centered on what U.S. inspectors will be permitted
to see and do as they try to learn whether the Soviets live up to
the requirements of the treaty to eliminate all their medium-range
missiles.

   The United States is encouraged by the
willingness of Lebanese leaders to reach a power-sharing agreement
that would enable orderly elections in Lebanon this summer, the
State Department said Friday.
   The remarks by deputy spokesman Phyllis Oakley marked the first
time the Reagan administration has expressed optimism publicly
about the five-month shuttle that veteran diplomat April Glaspie
has carried out between Lebanon and Syria.
   Privately, officials cautioned that agreement was not yet at
hand.
   ``It's a very plodding process,'' said one administration
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Glaspie is mediating between Syria's President Hafez Assad
and Lebanese President Amin Gemayel for Syrian-backed reforms that
would grant more political influence to Lebanon's Moslem majority.
   Gemayel and his Christian backers have been reluctant to cede
their dominance over Lebanon's political system in which the post
of president has traditionally been reserved for a Christian.
Gemayel and Assad have not spoken for more than a year.
   Assad yields broad influence in Lebanon because more than 30,000
Syrian troops controlling the eastern part of the country and some
sections of Beirut.
   ``I would say we're encouraged in our conviction that
responsible Lebanese leaders want to find fair guidelines for a
process to establish a central government exercising full authority
over a unified sovereign state,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``In that state, all Lebanese would enjoy comparable
opportunities for advancement,'' she said.
   ``Accordingly, we believe an agreement on such guidelines is not
only possible, but we hope can occur before the presidential
election this summer,'' she said.
   Under Lebanon's constitution, elections must be held before
Sept. 23. No date has been set. Gemayel is not running for a second
six-year term.
   U.S. officials are concerned that unless some arrangement is
worked out between Damascus and Beirut, elections may be disrupted
or not held at all. In that case, they fear, the ensuing power
vacuum might send the war-torn country into anarchy.
   The recent fighting in southern Beirut between the pro-Syrian
Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah faction ``demonstrates
the urgent need to restore the authority of a central government,''
Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``We abhor the loss of innocent lives and consider tragic the
new wave of diplaced persons,'' she added.
   The latest truce between the fighting factions, arranged by
Syrian and Iranian mediators, collapsed Friday.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo on Friday vetoed
restoration of the death penalty in New York Friday, making it 12
straight years that capital punishment has been blocked by the
state's chief executive, six by Cuomo.
   Assemblyman Vincent Graber, the Democratic-controlled Assembly's
chief death penalty advocate, said last week he lacked the votes to
override the veto.
   But state Sen. Dale Volker, the bill's sponsor in the
Republican-controlled Senate, said Friday that he'd attempt an
override even if one didn't appear likely in the Assembly.
   Cuomo said once again that he would urge the Legislature to pass
his alternative proposal to give life without parole to the state's
most violent criminals.
   His predecessor, Gov. Hugh Carey, vetoed death-penalty
legislation for six consecutive years until 1982, and Cuomo
subsequently has followed suit.
   The last criminal to die in New York's electric chair was Eddie
Lee Mays in 1963. Federal and state court rulings have since
rendered capital punishment statutes still on the books in New York
to be unenforceable.
   The legislation would have allowed the death penalty in cases
where an on-duty policeman or prison guard was murdered, when the
murder was committed to prevent a person from testifying at a
criminal proceeding, in murder-for-hire cases or when the defendant
committed murder along with another violent felony such as
kidnapping, rape or robbery.

<HEAD>CIA Officer Slain In Lebanon Honored At Memorial Service</HEAD>

   The former CIA station chief in Beirut was
honored Friday during a memorial service at his symbolic tombstone
in Arlington National Cemetery, nearly three years after he died as
a hostage in Lebanon.
   CIA Director William Webster eulogized William F. Buckley as a
man who ``did things that none of the rest would have done ... he
lived by example.''
   Buckley, the 51th CIA agent to die in the line of duty, had the
``ability to handle tough situations,'' Webster said. ``Bill
Buckley made a difference to those who worked with him.''
   President Reagan, in a letter read to Buckley's friends and
family at the outdoor ceremony, said the CIA man ``loved the United
States ... he cherished liberty.''
   The terrorists who seized Buckley ``tortured him and finally
killed him,'' Reagan said. The body of Buckley, 58 when he died on
June 3, 1985 after 15 months in captivity, was never recovered.
   An Army veteran who had earned two Silver Stars and two Purple
Hearts in Korea and Vietnam, Buckley was accorded full military
honors at the tradition-laden, 40-minute service attended by Army
Secretary John O. Marsh, Sophia Casey, the widow of former CIA
Director William J. Casey, and the families of four hostages still
held in Lebanon.
   In keeping with military custom, six white horses _ three
without riders _ drew a black caisson carrying a flag-draped casket
to the tree-shaded valley where Buckley's white headstone is
located.
   It reads: ``William Frances Buckley, Jr. Maj. U.S. Army. May 30,
1928-June 3, 1985.''
   The tombstone, similiar to thousands of others in the rolling
cemetery in nearby Virginia, is in a place for those people whose
bodies were never recovered, who were missing in action or lost at
sea.
   The smell of gunpower permeated the areas after three shots were
fired, and the Army band played the national anthem and ``Taps.''
   An American flag was unfolded, then folded over the tombstone,
and finally handed to Beverly Surette, one of Buckley's long-time
friends from North Reading, Mass.
   Buckley never married, but his two sisters, Joyce Wing of
Saugus, Mass., and Maureen Moroney of Salem, Mass., sat in the
front row with their families during the ceremony. Buckley's home
was Stoneham, Mass.
   Lt. Cmdr. Chip Beck, who first met Buckley in Vietnam 19 years
ago and saw him the week before he was kidnapped, helped organize
the ceremony and talked about his friend.
   ``Fate did not overcome Bill Buckley. He predicted what was to
happen when I last saw him, and he met fate head on. He endured,
far longer than he had to. His body finally failed in captivity,
but his spirit won,'' Beck said.
   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the
American hostages in Lebanon, said she felt compelled to attend the
ceremony to comfort Buckley's family.
   ``They have been there for me for three years ... They have
shared hope, tears and despair,'' she said, her voice choking with
emotion. Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was captured in March 1985.
   Mrs. Say, of Batavia, N.Y., returned from France Thursday where
she talked with three Frenchmen who were recently released from
captivity in Lebanon. The families of hostages Joseph Cicippio,
Frank Reed and Alec Collett were also in the audience.
   Sixteen foreigners remain hostage in Lebanon, nine of them
Americans. They are thought to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems.
   The memorial service was organized in part by No Greater Love, a
humanitarian group that works to support children whose families
were killed in war, and other victims.

   It wasn't as lavish as Charles and Di's, but
when two ``Sesame Street'' characters exchanged vows Friday, it was
the wedding of a lifetime, at least for those whose lifetime was
less than 10 years.
   Eight pairs of eyes were locked on the television set in Shirley
Foster's home as Maria and Luis got married in the season finale of
the children's program.
   As in most ``Sesame Street'' segments, there was a lesson to be
learned.
   ``Love is when somebody likes another person and they decide to
get married,'' said Shemeka Fennell, 7, who had the day off from
school and got to join the group at Mrs. Foster's house in New York
City.
   ``It's when you like somebody in a special way,'' chimed in John
Davy, 9.
   ``Big Bird looks nice,'' said Brandon Taylor, 5, who noticed
that the leggy yellow character looked, well, different. Big Bird
wore a giant turquoise flowered tie.
   ``Ernie and Bert look nice, too,'' Brandon said. They wore
tuxedo shirts and bow ties.
   Cookie Monster, in a relatively crumb-free shirt and tie, and
Oscar the Grouch, resplendent in a garbage-splattered tuxedo, also
were on hand.
   The show presented various preparations for the big event. While
Maria and Luis expressed cold feet in song, the fuzzy red Muppet
Elmo, the ring bearer, was concerned only with whether he would
drop the rings.
   The story line evolved after actress Sonia Manzano, who is
married in real life, told producers she and her husband were
thinking about starting a family and wondered how this would affect
Maria, her ``Sesame Street'' character.
   The answer was to have Maria get married, the first wedding in
the show's 19 years.
   ``One of the major questions we were faced with was what do
preschool children know about love and marriage and would they be
interested,'' said Valeria Lovelace, the show's director of
research.
   She said the decision to go ahead was made after researchers
found ``no books, no journals, no articles on preschoolers'
conception of love.''
   ``There were books on divorce, but they didn't really address
the issue of love and why people get married,'' Ms. Lovelace said.
``We really felt there was a void.''
   Some 90 Manhattan preschoolers questioned by researchers chose
kissing, hugging and picking flowers as ``behaviors of loving,''
Ms. Lovelace said, but ``they just didn't have any verbal responses
for it.
   ``We wanted to give them that verbal information: that marriage
is a promise; love is a very special feeling.''
   And so, Maria and Luis fell in love. The courtship began last
Christmas when they found a sick kitten and Luis, played by Emilio
Delgado, nursed it tenderly back to health. Maria was smitten.
   Over the TV season, the relationship developed, showing children
different stages of love including hand-holding, kissing, hugging
and even arguing _ all leading up to Maria and Luis' wedding day.
   The show, produced by the Children's Television Workshop, was
taped in November and aired on public television stations
nationwide Friday.
   The pint-sized viewers who gathered at Mrs. Foster's home gave
the affair a thumbs up, except for 19-month-old Ryan Holder.
   He snored through the hourlong show.

Moved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian troops clashed with Iranian-backed
fundamentalists on Beirut's airport highway Friday in the first
Syrian intervention in the battle over south Beirut. Six people
were reported killed.
   The Ash-Shiraa magazine said the Iranian-backed guerrillas have
spirited foreign hostages, who are believed held in the slums of
south Beirut, from one hiding place to another to prevent their
liberation.
   The fight between the Syrian troops and Hezbollah guerrillas
came as Hezbollah pushed Syrian-backed Amal fighters out of one
slum neighborhood, police said.
   Hezbollah guerrillas, moving behind a heavy barrage of
howitzers, fought deep into the Raml el-Ali section and seized the
Mosque of the Great Prophet from Amal troops, a police spokesman
said.
   The rival militias battled with tanks, mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades over the area, which abuts the main
Beirut airport highway.
   Hezbollah's victory brought portions of the airport and the
airport highway, controlled by the Syrian army, within the army's
firing range, said the spokesman, who under standing rules cannot
be named.
   Shortly thereafter, a Hezbollah sniper killed an aide of a
senior Syrian officer on the highway.
   ``A group of Hezbollah fighters clad in Iranian flags over their
battle fatigues later attempted to cross the highway. The Syrians
opened fire and killed five Hezbollahis,'' the spokesman said.
   All roads to the airport were closed, but planes continued to
land and take off even though stray bullets whizzed over the
runways and tarmac.
   ``We shall wipe out any attempt to re-establish any militia
presence in any Syrian-policed territory and shall crush any
encroachment on our lines or soldiers,'' said Brig. Gen. Ali
Hammoud, commander of the Syrian contingent.
   The Syrians maintain a 7,500-strong contingent in Moslem west
Beirut. Until Friday, they had stayed out of the Hezbollah-Amal
confrontation, but the warned they would not tolerate any attack
against them.
   Police said Amal's positions in the slums were ``rapidly falling
one after another'' into Hezbollah's hands after the fighting broke
out at 1 p.m.
   In all, police said 10 people were killed and 18 wounded in
Friday's fighting, which ended a 36-hour truce, one of several
cease-fires brokered by Syria and Iran. The figure included those
killed in the Syrian-Hezbollah battle.
   The overall toll was 198 killed and 561 wounded since the
confrontation for control of the 16-square-mile shantytown began
last Friday.
   Lebanon's Ash-Shiraa magazine said the blindfolded foreign
hostages were taken last Saturday to the house of Sheik Ibrahim
al-Amin, the spokesman for Hezbollah, which is believed to hold
most of the 18 hostages _ including nine Americans _ missing in
Beirut.
   Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut-based weekly, said the hostages were moved
to al-Amin's house in a relatively safer south Beirut area, but it
did not name the neighborhood where the house is located.
   Shiite sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
al-Amin's house is about 50 yards from the residence of Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's spiritual leader.
   The weekly, which was the first to report the secret U.S. arms
sales to Iran in November 1986, cited no sources, and the report
could not be independently verified.
   Al-Amin was not available for comment. Hezbollah's press office
in south Beirut's district of Bir el-Abed did not answer telephone
calls.
   Ash-Shiraa has good sources in the Iranian government and among
the Shiite community in Lebanon, but many of its recent reports on
foreign hostages have not panned out.
   Amal, Arabic for hope, accused Hezbollah of using the four-day
truce, called by presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Ali Khamenei
of Iran, to prepare for the latest onslaught.
   Police said the personal representatives of Assad and Khamenei,
Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Hussein Sheikholeslam, were holding talks with delegates from the
two warring factions at the Iranian Embassy.
   Hezbollah's fighters won control of 70 percent of the slums
before the latest cease-fire was proclaimed Wednesday. Police said
Friday's drive left only the Shiyah district under Amal's control.
   Meanwhile, Christian militia leader Samir Geagea, a pro-Israeli
foe of Syria, was reported Friday to have escaped an attempted
assassination by a car bomb in Lebanon's Christian heartland north
of Beirut.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station said the
bomb exploded as a Lebanese Forces militia motorcade was passing
through the tiny village of Mastita near the ancient port of Byblos
at 10 p.m. Tuesday.
   It said Geagea, who commands the 4,000-strong Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main paramilitary machine, was supposed to be
traveling in the six-vehicle motorcade but wasn't.
   Police confirmed that a car packed with 330 pounds of TNT
exploded in Mastita, 20 miles north of Beirut, wounding five people.

   A boy was sentenced on his 17th birthday to
five consecutive life terms in prison after pleading guilty but
mentally ill to five murders.
   Clinton Bankston Jr. will be eligible for parole in 25 years,
Clarke County District Attorney Harry Gordon said Thursday.
   Bankston told Clarke County Superior Judge Joseph Gaines: ``I
want to tell you, judge, I'm sorry I killed those people.''
   Bankston laughed loudly as he was escorted from the courtroom.
His attorney, Edward Tolley, said the laugh under stress is
symptomatic of his client's mental illness.
   Bankston pleaded in the April 1987 stabbing deaths of retired
University of Georgia professors Glenn and Rachel Sutton in their
home and the August hatchet slayings of Sally Nathanson, 59, her
daughter, Helen, 22, and Mrs. Nathanson's sister, Ann Orr Morris,
63.
   Bankston was 15 when the Suttons were killed and 16 at the time
of the other murders.
   Tolley said he decided to enter the plea because evidence of
both guilt and mental illness were overwhelming and because of a
recent Georgia Supreme Court decision barring execution of people
who were under age 17 when they committed their crimes.

<HEAD>Ireland to Resume Extraditing Terrorists to Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland has agreed to resume extraditing terror
suspects to Britain after a five-month disagreement over
procedures, the Attorney General's Office said Friday.
   The governments long have been at odds over the Irish Republic's
reluctance to extradite people sought for trial in connection with
the Irish Republican Army's bloody campaign to drive the British
from Northern Ireland.
   Britain has refused to abide by an Irish extradition law that
took effect Dec. 1. It requires London to provide detailed
evidence, including names of witnesses, to support warrants and
empowers the Irish attorney general, currently John Murray, to pass
on all extraditions.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the legislation a ``step
backward'' that would make it harder for Britain to secure
extradition of IRA suspects.
   Under new arrangements, the British attorney general, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, will send a summary of evidence and his Irish
counterpart will decide ``on a case-by-case basis'' whether
suspects should be arrested, Mayhew's office said in a statement.
   Ireland's government declined comment on the new procedures,
which news reports said were agreed upon earlier this week when
Mayhew and Murray met in Dublin.
   Mayhew's office said: ``The Irish attorney general has modified
certain stipulations which in the United Kingdom's view went beyond
the requirements of the legislation.
   ``The Irish have accepted the validity of British concerns that
there must be no prejudice to the administration of justice in any
eventual proceedings in the United Kingdom on the return of the
fugitives.
   ``We understand that the Irish attorney general has already
authorized the backing of warrants in one particular case under the
new procedure.''
   Relations between the governments have deteriorated in recent
months because of several disputes over the quality of British
justice.
   Those include the British Appeal Court's refusal to grant a
retrial to six Irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb
attacks that killed 21 people in 1974. The six claim they were
convicted on the basis of faulty forensic evidence and confessions
that they claim were beaten out of them.

   The state of the economy seems almost
too good to be true less than seven months after the stock market
plunge, business leaders said Friday.
   The Business Council, composed of 61 executives from the largest
U.S. corporations, predicted modest growth, low unemployment and
moderate inflation this year in a report issued at its meeting at
the Homestead resort.
   ``The economy and our businesses are doing quite well in spite
of that problem,'' said John F. Akers, chairman of International
Business Machines Corp., referring to the Oct. 19 stock market
crash. ``Nobody is talking about that anymore.''
   In fact, the economic forecast of the business group, which
represents the consensus of member corporations' chief economists,
paints a more optimistic picture than the prediction issued just
before the crash.
   The business executives projected somewhat slower growth in the
economy as measured by the gross national product _ 2.4 percent
this year compared with a forecast of 3 percent made when they last
met in early October.
   But they said both inflation and unemployment will be lower than
they thought seven months ago and that growth will be more balanced
than the 3.8 percent expansion in 1987.
   A buildup in inventories contributed almost one percentage point
to last year's growth. That is expected to moderate, with increased
exports and spending by businesses on new equipment filling in the
gap.
   Consumer spending, although growing at half of the 4 percent
annual rate of the early 1980s, is expected to hold steady through
1989, providing room in the economy for the production of exports.
   ``I don't want to go on record saying (the crash) was a good
thing, but there were certainly good aspects to it,'' said John S.
Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding
company.
   It relieved an unhealthy buildup of tensions in the financial
markets and provided the world's central bankers an opportunity to
lower interest rates, Reed said.
   But underlying the optimism was a sense of unease among some
executives that they attributed to two of the principal problems
blamed for causing the crash: the federal budget deficit and the
trade deficit.
   ``Many of us continue to feel we must be living on borrowed time
to be having such good business conditions when the underlying
fundementals are so questionable,'' said Edmund T. Pratt Jr.,
chairman of Pfizer Inc., a diversified health care company.
   The stubbornly high trade deficit will drop from a record $171.2
billion in 1987 to less than $150 billion this year, the executives
said.
   But they said that will not be enough to prevent a further slide
in the dollar, which has already lost half its value in two years
when measured against the Japanese yen. The executives said the
dollar, now trading at about 125 yen, will drop to 115 yen by the
end of next year.
   The budget deficit was predicted to remain ``disturbingly high''
at $154 billion in 1988, up from $150.2 billion in 1987.
   ``Clearly nothing will be done about it in an election year,''
said Robert D. Kilpatrick, chairman of CIGNA Corp., an insurance
company.
   The executives' report also sounded a warning about rising
interest rates. Major banks this week raised their prime lending
rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent.
   Too much economic growth ``could produce an unavoidable rise in
interest rates and a recession before the end of 1989,'' it said.
   However, Willard C. Butcher, chairman of the Chase Manhattan
Bank, said he was not overly concerned about the increase in the
prime rate and said rates may fall back slightly by the end of the
year. ``I think we're overdoing fears of inflation,'' he said.
   The Business Council saw consumer prices rising 3.9 percent in
1988, down from the 4.4 percent rate in 1987. It said unemployment,
which was 5.4 percent in April, would remain under 6 percent
through 1989.
   Opening their two-day meeting, the executives were briefed in
private by Commerce Secretary C. William Verity and U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter. Other speakers on the scheduled
included Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the assistant Republican
Senate leader, and Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., the ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.

   A jury was seated Friday to hear the trial
of a man charged in the kidnapping and death of a businessman who
was buried alive in a box.
   Daniel J. Edwards, 31, is charged with kidnap and murder in the
death of Stephen Small, 40, of Kankakee who was abducted Sept. 2.
Small's abductors demanded $1 million ransom, but the family never
received clear instructions for delivery of the money and he
suffocated before he could be found.
   Edwards and Nancy D. Rish, 26, who lived together in
Bourbonnais, were arrested two days after the abduction and hours
before police found Small's body in woods.
   The Illinois attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the
case, has said it plans to seek the death penalty for Edwards.
   The jury and two alternates were selected from a pool of 53
people, who were questioned about their knowledge of the case and
their views on the death penalty.
   Kankakee County Circuit Judge John Michala was to hear further
motions in the case Friday afternoon. Opening statements were
scheduled Monday in Kankakee.
   Jurors were chosen from Winnebago County to avoid possible
prejudice. Michala planned to sequester the jury in Kankakee.
   Four jurors were chosen Thursday and the rest Friday.
   The body of Small, great-grandson of former Illinois Gov. Len
Small and a member of a family with major media holdings, was found
in a homemade box buried in 3 feet of sand. The box was equipped
with a jug of water, candy bars and an unconnected battery-powered
light.
   Ms. Rish also was charged with murder and kidnapping. No trial
date has been set for her.

   Tokyo District Court has dismissed a suit filed by
a 48-year-old man who demanded $73 for mental damages he claimed he
suffered when a concert by Madonna was canceled due to bad weather,
a court official said Friday.
   In the suit, filed against the concert tour sponsor, Tokyo
Broadcasting System, office worker Kazunari Igarashi demanded that
Madonna return for a make-up concert, according to the official who
spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Madonna's Tokyo debut performance, one of the five concerts
scheduled, was canceled June 20, 1987, because of rain and wind.
The court ruled the suit ``inappropriate'' because a make-up
concert is impossible without cooperation from Madonna, the
official said.

   ``I used to stand there and make up bald-faced lies. I'd stand
there and say, `Well, here's a song about ...,' and I'd just ramble
on, making it up as I went,'' Prine said in an interview published
Thursday in the Nashville Banner.

   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould is writing a
book about the Baby M case, and the child's father and his wife
want to know what the surrogate mother plans to say before the book
comes out.
   William and Elizabeth Stern filed a motion, released Thursday,
asking for the right to final approval and to prohibit the use of
any baby pictures of 2-year-old Melissa Stern, who lives with the
Sterns.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has been working on the book for a year
with a Pennsylvania writer, Loretta Schwartz-Nobel. St. Martin's
Press has said it will publish it next year.
   Attorney Harold J. Cassidy has written Superior Court Judge
Birger M. Sween to say his client, the surrogate mother, feels the
judge's order of April 6 that the parties cannot publicly discuss
the case does not apply to her relationship with Baby M before the
date of the order.
   But the Sterns said in an April 28 motion that they should be
allowed to review the manuscript and if necessary seek restraints
on discussion of the child.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould agreed in 1985 to bear a child for Stern
for $10,000. She later sought to keep the baby, setting off a
widely publicized court case. The child lives with the Sterns in
Tenafly, and her mother sees her one day a week.

   Sandy Duncan says she fit into ``Valerie's
Family'' so well, the producers are thinking of putting her name on
the show that once starred Valerie Harper.
   ``People were wary at first,'' Ms. Duncan says in the May 15
issue of Parade magazine about her initiation as Sandy Hogan on the
show Ms. Harper walked out on in a contract dispute.
   ``But the Valerie thing was not of global importance, and I said
so, and now nobody asks me about it anymore.''
   She said the show was doing well and ``will probably be renewed
for next season, but they're thinking of calling it `The Hogan
Family.' We already got sweaters and jackets with Hogan labels.''

<HEAD>Boston Judge Could Be Summit Topic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boston Housing Court judge may become a topic of
conversation at this month's U.S.-Soviet summit because a
defendant's wife wrote to Soviet officials that the judge had
treated her husband unfairly.
   Judge George E. Daher got a call this week from the State
Department's Human Rights Bureau asking for details of a case in
which he jailed James Lynch, a Boston man who reportedly cursed him
and charged the bench.
   The man's wife, Virginia, wrote to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington complaining that his rights had been violated.
   U.S. officials fear the letter could end up on the agenda of the
Moscow summit, Daher said Thursday.
   ``I can't believe they will raise this as a civil liberties
issue,'' Samuel Kreiter, the Human Rights Bureau staff member who
talked to Daher, said. ``If it does come up, it won't last very
long. We have evidence she and her husband were afforded due
process.''
   Daher said Lynch was not denied his rights.
   ``Any time the Russians want to play back the tapes (of the
hearing), we'll gladly play them back,'' he said. ``His due process
rights were protected.
   ``I'm so proud of our judicial system. We can stand the scrutiny
from the Russians or Martians or anyone. I am sure the Russians can
learn from it,'' Daher said.
   Lynch appeared before Daher last October after officials
complained he was violating city codes by operating an auto repair
shop out of a residential garage.
   Daher dismissed the case after the city dropped the complaint,
but court records indicate Lynch began arguing with police officers
as he was walking out of court.
   Daher reprimanded him, and Lynch swore at him and charged the
bench, according to the records.
   Daher ordered Lynch to undergo psychiatric evaluation, and when
he was found mentally competent, sentenced him to 90 days for
contempt of court.
   The judge freed Lynch for Christmas and canceled the rest of the
sentence.
   It was after Lynch was released that his wife wrote to the
Soviets.
   She was fired as a police officer in 1981 after being found
``unfit for duty,'' records show. She sued the city, contending she
had a nervous breakdown from being harassed by colleagues after
reporting three officers beat a handcuffed prisoner.
   She got a $93,000 settlement in court this year, but officials
said she had not picked up the check. She also was reinstated as an
officer but placed on disability leave.
   Last Dec. 27, Pravda, the Communist Party's daily newspaper,
published an article about Mrs. Lynch under the headline, ``Help
Virginia Lynch.''
   The newspaper said she was ``the victim of unjust repressions,''
and that police ``behaved themselves like gangsters'' for firing
her.

<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan rebel leader
acknowledged that dissidents are seeking to oust their military
leader, Col. Enrique Bermudez, but played down reports of an
uprising within the ranks.
   In an interview Thursday night, Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros
also accused the Nicaraguan government of fueling the discontent
and criticized the United States for not being a better ally.
   Matamoros said a small group of dissidents wrongly accused
Bermudez, a former national guard commander and the ranking Contra
military leader, of cronyism and corruption.
   The U.S.-backed rebels are fighting to overthrow the leftist
Sandinista government, which has been in power since 1979.
   Some reports have said that up to 4,000 fighters were engaged in
a mutiny at a Contra base camp in Yamales, 20 miles north of the
Honduran border.
   ``That's one of the most fantastic things I've heard,''
Matamoros said.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed because
Honduran authorities barred journalists from traveling to the
isolated region.
   According to the spokesman, only 726 combatants were at the base.
   Sources claimed some of the Contras charged Bermudez with
corruption and inefficiency. Matamoros acknowledged there were
gripes but said reports of a rift in the rebel movement were
exaggerated.
   ``They have the legitimate right to differences of opinions,''
Matamoros said. ``But from that to conclude that the organization
is at the breaking point ... would be to ignore the fact that this
organization has 17,000 men.''
   The Sandinista government in Nicaragua claims there are 6,000
Contras. Other sources say there are up to 10,000.
   Bermudez, and civilian Contra leaders Pedro Joaquin Chamorro and
Maria Azucena Ferrey met with the troops at Yamales this week.
   ``There is not a climate of confrontation there,'' the spokesman
said.
   The apparent rift was highlighted last week after Honduras
deported seven Contras to the United States. Matamoros said the
soldiers were deported becaus they were publicly discussing rebel
issues, a sensitive point for the Hondurans, who for years have
barely acknowledged the existence of the base camps.
   One of the dissidents, Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, known as
Comandante Fernando, reportedly evaded the authorities and fled to
Yamales, which until last year was the Contras' strategic command
post. Matamoros said he was briefly detained by Hernandez
Membreno's troops along the road to the camp Sunday.
   Matamoros said the grumblings about Bermudez surfaced last
month. In response, the joint chiefs of staff sent a letter April
20 requesting a meeting to discuss the allegations. That letter, he
said, was followed by one two days later from the Council of
Commanders, made up of the 27 regional commanders.
   The spokesman said three Contras, Hernandez Membreno, Walter
Calderon and Tirzo Moreno responded in a letter April 26 that their
allegations were ``not unfounded'' but did not elaborate.
   ``They say they oppose Bermudez's authority. But there is no
material proof, just allegations,'' Matamoros said.
   Matamoros said the Council of Commanders would make the final
decisions regarding the allegations. Bermudez could be removed only
by the five-member national directorate, headquartered in Miami.
   The internal problems come at a time when the Contras are
attempting to work out a permanent truce with the Sandinistas to
end the more than six-year war. Both sides have made little headway
since they signed a temporary cease-fire agreement March 23.
   The 60-day temporary cease-fire started April 1.
   The two pro-Sandinista newspapers in Managua have been giving
front-page displays to the Contra squabbles.
   The cease-fire pact called for the rebels to move into seven
zones. In exchange, the Sandinistas would allow them to receive
supplies and send representatives to take part in national talks to
resolve some of the nation's problems. The government also was to
gradually release more than 3,000 political prisoners.

<HEAD>Cash-For-Food Plan For Rebels Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, contending that
many Contra rebels inside Nicaragua are desperately short of food,
will begin sending them cash at the rate of about $1 a day per
rebel for food purchases, it was announced Friday.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley brushed aside
complaints from House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, that the rebels
might use the money illegally to buy weapons.
   ``They already have weapons. What they need at this moment
desperately is food, and we're confident that they will naturally
use these small funds to provide for their basic survival,'' she
said.
   An agreement signed between the Contras and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government on March 23 permits humanitarian aid for the
rebels, but no shipments have been made thus far because of a
dispute over how the assistance should be delivered, among other
reasons.
   Meanwhile, many Contras inside Nicaragua were said to be
suffering from an inadequate diet. As an interim measure, the
administration about three weeks ago began arranging deliveries by
truck and air drop of food to rebel camps in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Contras have fled Nicaragua for
Honduras in search of food in recent weeks.
   Officials from the Agency for International Development, in a
preliminary discussion with reporters of the plan announced Friday,
had said Monday that most of the aid will be in the form of
Nicaraguan currency delivered by Contra couriers based in Honduras.
   Some food also will be delivered, but the emphasis will be on
cash transfers because of limits on the amount of food that can be
carried.
   AID was designated to manage the $48 million humanitarian aid
program approved by Congress in late March, a week after the
Contras and the Sandinistas reached a truce agreement that allows
for such aid to the rebels.
   The secretary general of the Organization of American States,
Joao Baena Soares, has criticized both deliveries of food to Contra
camps in Honduras and the cash-for-food plan.
   Baena Soares, a member of a verification commission assigned to
ensure compliance with the Contra-Sandinista agreement, has said
that neither plan falls within the limits of what the two sides
have approved.
   But an administration official said Wednesday that the other
member of the commission, Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo, has raised no objections to the cash-for-food plan.
   The administration has accused the Sandinista government of
using delaying tactics during negotiations in a bid to starve the
Contras into submission.
   But Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez said Thursday his
government is willing to allow immediate delivery of humanitarian
supplies to rebels in Nicaragua. He denied that the government is
trying to starve the Contras.
   ``We are in full disposition to accept that the Contra forces
could receive humanitarian aid inside Nicaragua tomorrow, if
possible,'' Ramirez told reporters after a 1{-hour meeting with
Wright and other Democratic congressional leaders.
   Ramirez did not discuss his views on the cash-for-food plan.
Wright has described the plan as a ``last resort'' because there
are no guarantees the money won't be used to buy weapons. He also
expressed concern that the cash might be used to buy weapons in
violation of both the Contra-Sandinista agreement and the terms of
the $48 million aid package.
   The package provides for food, clothing, shelter and medical
supplies as well as treatment for children who are war victims.
Money also was set aside to finance the work of the verification
commission.

<HEAD>Math Contest Winner Hardly Touches Pencil and Paper To Answer
Questions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Andrew Shultz, a 13-year-old Evanston, Ill.,
math whiz, hardly lifted a pencil Friday as he shut out the
competition and won the title of the nation's top grade school
``mathlete.''
   Shultz left rivals scratching their heads as he called out
answers while they were still jotting down the questions in the
final, frenetic rounds of a contest called Mathcounts.
   Seeded fifth, he made short work out of five contestants he
faced one-on-one by correctly answering 10 of 11 questions, doing
most of his calculations in his head.
   The only seventh-grader in the finals, Robert Kleinberg, 12, of
Iroquois Middle School in Wales Center, N.Y., captured second.
Daniel Hanish, 13, of Omaha, Neb., was third.
   Asked to explain his prowess at mental mathematics, Shultz said,
``I don't know. It just comes.''
   ``When I was 4, I couldn't write with pencil and paper,'' said
Shultz, an 8th grader at Haven Middle School in Evanston. ``My
writing's still pretty messy.''
   Some of that talent may be in the genes.
   His mother, who embarrassed him by penetrating a circle of
reporters and planting a kiss on his cheek (``MOM! You had to do
that?''), is an elementary math teacher and his father a professor
at Purdue University.
   The contest drew more than 200 contestants from around the
nation.
   Shultz won a gold medal, a computer and a week at the U.S. Space
Camp in Huntsville, Ala. He also led a contingent of the math
champions who met with President Reagan in the Oval Office.
   The final questions ranged from the score a bowler needed to
maintain his average to complex algebraic functions.
   Shultz ended the contest by answering ``Four square root two''
to the question: ``If f(x) equals x plus the absolute value of x,
find the distance between points A(2,f(2)) and B(-2,f(-2)).''
   Hanish, the third-place finisher, said, ``After he won three
rounds in a row, I knew he was probably going to take first. One of
the questions he answered so fast normally would have taken 20 to
30 seconds.''
   Shultz finished 71st at last year's finals, after ``I ate too
much food at breakfast,'' he recalled.
   ``You can't prepare a lot. If you prepare too much, you're up
too late and you wake up the next morning and you feel terrible,''
said Shultz, who likes ``chess and computers and playing a bit of
sports, although I'm not very good.''
   The other finalists, all 8th graders, in fourth to tenth place
were: Matthew Bruce, 13, Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Okla.; Akira
Negi, 15, East Northport Junior High School, N.Y.; Matthew Carle,
13, North Davie Junior High, Advance, N.C.; Richard Chung, 12,
Southern Junior High, Lexington, Ky.; Matthew Sakai, 13, Murray
Junior High, Ridgecrest, Calif.; Nathan Wilmes, 13, J.F. Kennedy
Junior High, Plantsville, Conn.; and Melissa Chen, 13, Lincoln East
Junior High, Lincoln, Neb. Melissa was the only girl in the finals.
   Some of the questions Shultz answered were:
   _``Joel's bowling average was 132 per game. Today his scores on
the first three games were 112, 182 and 142. What is the score he
must get on his fourth game in order to maintain his average
exactly?'' Ninety-two.
   _``A family has four children. If male births and female births
are equally likely, what is the probability that at least two of
the children are girls?'' Eleven-sixteenths.
   The contest is sponsored by the National Society of Professional
Engineers, the National Council of Teachers of Mathmatics, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Department
of Education and CNA Insurance Cos.
   The contestants were divided into teams of four by state or
territory. The top 10 state teams were: New York, North Carolina,
Illinois, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Kentucky,
California and Maryland.

<TEXT>
   British critics are throwing brickbats at the
Royal Shakespeare Company after several poorly received productions
at home and the belated Broadway opening of its musical ``Carrie,''
which was panned.
   ``The RSC is a national asset. I think it's time to sound the
alarm,'' John Peter wrote in The Sunday Times after giving bad
reviews to two new productions in the company's home theater at
Stratford-upon-Avon, William Shakespeare's birthplace.
   Peter, who had harsh words for the new stagings of Shakespeare's
``Much Ado About Nothing'' and William Wycherley's ``The Plain
Dealer,'' wrote: ``There was a time, not that many years ago, when
you could look to the RSC for expertise, excellence, and
enjoyment.''
   Now, he said, ``the Royal Shakespeare Company is in trouble.''
   Michael Billington of the Guardian said the Stratford season had
an ``unnervingly shaky start.'' Of six productions since March 30,
only ``Across Oka,'' a new play by Robert Holman, received
favorable reviews.
   Negative reaction to ``Carrie'' in New York probably will
generate further talk of a decline. Peter lamented the prolonged
devotion of director Terry Hands to a show the critic called
``frightful.''
   In 1984-55, Hands' productions of ``Much Ado About Nothing'' and
``Cyrano de Bergerac'' took New York by storm, but he spent much of
the past year on the rock musical adaptation of the Stephen King
horror novel. ``Carrie'' opened May 12 at Broadway's Virginia
Theater after several delays.
   The $7 million musical received some sharp notices in New York,
and its initial reception in Stratford in February was harsher
still. Several critics wondered in print whether the company had
lost its sense of purpose.
   Michael Coveney in The Financial Times said ``Carrie'' was
``enjoyable in a masochistic way'' and decried Hands' participation
in ``an utter cultural vacuum of dance studio robotics with a hint
of cultural and classical pretensions.''
   Hands has fared little better in the non-musical area. His
productions of Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar'' and Jean Genet's
``The Balcony'' were received with little enthusiasm.
   In an interview with The Associated Press before taking
``Carrie'' to New York, he said: ``I know it is fashionable for
everybody to know how to run the RSC and therefore to use their
pens and their newspapers to demonstrate their own particular area
of special interest.''
   He said the company has a ``tradition of music theater'' linked
to the extensive use of music in Shakespeare's plays. More
recently, the Royal Shakespeare won plaudits and profits with ``Les
Miserables,'' which premiered at the Barbican in October 1985 and
swept New York's Tony Awards last June.
   A trade newspaper, The Stage, said in the company's favor:
``Personally, and in spite of the somewhat spiky personalities of
certain people in charge of its affairs, we have a good deal of
sympathy with the RSC. To maintain that the RSC should be wound up,
as one or two of our readers suggest, is unthinkable.'' The Royal
Shakespeare's output is formidable. It opened 39 productions in six
theaters in 1987-88 and will open 37 this year. All of Broadway
averages about 30 shows a year.

<HEAD>Agreement Near on Budget, But Senate Panel Wants To Ignore It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators neared agreement
Friday on a $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget, but the Senate's main
spending committee voted to ignore it.
   The budget negotiators, deadlocked a month past their deadline,
were near approval of a plan that would delay a decision on whether
to add more spending for the space program or for education.
   With the Senate favoring more for space and the House more for
education, the budget proposal being circulated Friday would leave
the matter unresolved. Minimum amounts would be set for broad
spending categories, and a pot of $500 million would be left
uncommitted.
   A House vote on the compromise was expected next week. But the
budget, normally an important guidepost for Congress' production of
its annual spending bills, was taking the appearance of a
procedural exercise.
   Last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with President Reagan,
created in the wake of the stock market crash, pre-set the overall
totals for domestic, military and foreign aid spending. The House
and Senate spending committees, eager to finish their work this
election year, have gone ahead without the budget blueprint to
divide up the domestic pie.
   The House Appropriations Committee this week sent to the full
House three of the 13 annual appropriations bills, using its own
vision of how domestic spending should be allocated.
   On Friday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a set of
priorities sticking more closely to President Reagan's budget than
the one passed by the Senate.
   The committee approved a proposal drafted by Sens. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., to reject the
budget's tight restraints on water projects and interior programs,
and cut back on health, education and poverty programs.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., also a
member of the appropriations panel, offered an amendment to shift
money back to the budget priorities, but was defeated 14-11.
   ``Water projects are important, but I thought education was
important. I thought health was important,'' he said.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, a liberal Republican from Connecticut, said
in the past he was always fighting against the White House but now
it was the Democratic-controlled Congress providing less money for
education and AIDS research.
   ``Now I can train my guns on your party, and not my own,'' he
said.
   Johnston, who has been running the appropriations committee for
the ailing Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., said his proposal reflected
the Senate's priorities better than the budget, which he called
``virtually meaningless.''
   He claimed the Senate did not understand the spending plan when
it approved it last month.
   The committee was relying on the budget resolution only for
technical definitions of how to comply with the deficit-reduction
agreement with Reagan, Johnston said.
   One of those technical disputes was settled Friday when
lawmakers and the White House tentatively agreed to allow about
$1.9 billion in total domestic spending beyond the level first
envisioned in the president's budget.
   Both the House and Senate budgets had sought to expand spending
by redefining some domestic accounts so they would not count
against the spending caps. The White House agreed to accept the
Senate level, which allowed slightly less new spending than the
House plan.
   The added spending would put the fiscal 1989 budget closer to
violating the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Although exact
figures were not available Friday, budget aides said if the deficit
swelled only $2 billion to $3 billion more, the spending plan might
hit the $146 billion threshold for triggering automatic spending
cuts as required by Gramm-Rudman.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly urged the United
States on Friday not to close the PLO Observer Mission, which
represents the Palestinian people at the United Nations.
   In a 136-2 vote, Israel and the United States were the only
countries to oppose the resolution calling on the United States to
allow the Palestine Liberation Organization Mission to operate
under an international treaty.
   It was the third time since March the General Assembly had sent
the United States such a message.
   The United States is seeking a federal court order to close the
PLO Mission. The United Nations considers the mission the sole
legal representative of the Palestinian people at the 159-member
world body.
   The PLO is invited to speak on all Middle East issues, but it
cannot vote.
   The resolution calls on the United States to honor the U.S.-U.N.
Headquarters Treaty of 1947 requiring it to allow all U.N.
missions, including the PLO representative, to operate and
discharge official functions.
   But a U.S. anti-terrorism law passed by the Congress in 1987
requires closure of the PLO Mission and is in conflict with the
treaty.
   The International Court of Justice in the Hague last month
decreed that the United States is obligated to take the PLO dispute
to court. The United States has defied the court order.
   PLO Ambassador Zehdi Labib Terzi told the assembly that
international law must take precedence over domestic legislation.
   ``Can the U.N. Headquarters in the U.S.A. still be able to
discharge its responsibilities fully and effectively if its host
country is violating the headquarters treaty?'' Terzi asked. ``Will
missions accredited to the U.N. be able to function
independently?'' he asked.

   Dorothy Jean Brown, 44, barely spoke above a whisper in telling
U.S. District Court Judge Frederic N. Smalkin that she was unaware
Kendol Kernes was not her child when she took him nearly a year ago
but now accepts he is someone else's boy.
   Smalkin said Ms. Brown exhibited ``aberrant behavior'' and
recommended she receive continued psychiatric treatment.
   ``Somehow or other Ms. Brown has come to believe that she had a
baby,'' Smalkin said. ``We're not dealing here with somebody who
acts out of typical criminal motivation.''
   Smalkin said he would not impose fines against Ms. Brown, a
former Baltimore Museum of Art security guard, because she had not
held a job since the kidnapping. He said time she already served
will be included in her sentence. She has been in jail since her
arrest in October.
   Ms. Brown will become eligible for parole after serving at least
one-third of her sentence. She could have received a maximum
penalty of life imprisonment.
   Ms. Brown, pleaded guilty March 25 to a kidnapping charge that
accused her of taking the infant she abducted in Baltimore across
state lines. She had fled to Philadelphia with the baby. While
agreeing to a plea bargain, Assistant U.S. Attorney Carmina S.
Hughes said she would recommend ``substantial'' incarceration for
Ms. Brown.
   The child was taken from his mother's room June 18, a week after
another widely publicized baby-snatching in nearby Prince George's
County.

   Gertrude Brown dropped out of high school to
have a baby and returned to her own education four children later
at the age of 49. On Sunday, the 61-year-old mother-in-law of
Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson will get her degree
from Hampton University.
   ``I went back to school to get the skills to help people,'' Mrs.
Brown said at a Friday news conference with her daughter, Jackie
Jackson, at her side.
   Mrs. Brown is receiving her degree in social work and plans to
eventually open a center for teen-age parents.
   ``I was a teen-age mother,'' she explained.
   While working full time at the Veterans Administration in the
dietetics department, Mrs. Brown saw four of her children through
college, returned to get her high school degree and finally her
college degree.
   ``She has been the chief example in my life,'' said Mrs.
Jackson. ``I can remember her as a struggling young woman, who as a
positive person, a realist. I can also remember a number of
whippings because my vocabulary contained phrases like `I can't.'''
   Mrs. Brown was born in the Bahamas and raised in Flordia before
moving to Virginia.
   ``This is such an exciting time. I'm finally getting this
degree,'' she said. ``I was an honor student until this last
quarter. ... I think I was worrying too much about my children and
the campaign.
   ``But I'm not going to stop here,'' she said. ``I'm going to get
my masters now.''
   Mrs. Jackson said that when she was growing up, she considered
her mother to be overly strict and old fashioned. Now, she said,
she imposes on her own children the same rules as her mother
imposed on her.
   ``It has been an exciting summer, '' Mrs. Jackson said. ``Two of
my sons graduated from college and another from high school. ...
Now we have a rare occasion to see our parents fulfill a dream.''
   Jackson will give the commencement address to his
mother-in-law's class Sunday morning.
   Mrs. Brown's only comment about the Jackson campaign was that
she was excited.

   A $300 expense check that blew out of a
broken airplane window will complete its trip to Cleveland the
conventional way _ through the U.S. mail.
   The check was in Robert J. Yaroma's suitcoat in the back of a
small plane flying at 16,000 feet Monday night when a rear window
blew out on the flight from Philadelphia to Cleveland. The jacket
and his raincoat were sucked out of the plane.
   On Tuesday, a worker mowing the grass at a former nuclear fuel
reprocessing plant about 30 miles south of Buffalo spotted the
check, said Mickie Andrus, a spokeswoman at the West Valley
Demonstration Project, which is cleaning up the site.
   A plant security official traced the check to Yaroma, an
investment counselor who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Westlake,
and first spoke to his wife. ``She just couldn't believe the check
was here,'' Ms. Andrus said.
   Later, Yaroma called back. ``He was just very, very polite and
couldn't thank us enough. He even wanted to send our security
official a reward,'' Ms. Andrus said.
   Yaroma said the coats are still missing.
   ``I figured my suitcoat is on the back of some cow or hanging in
a tree,'' he said.
   When the plane window blew out, thunderstorms were moving across
northeastern Ohio and into Pennsylvania and western New York. The
airplane landed safely at Cleveland without further incident and
nobody was injured, Yaroma said.
   Donald Wuerch, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather
Service office at Buffalo, said: ``I suspect the check was probably
caught up in a thunderstorm line that moved through the area. It
was probably caught in the atmospheric turbulence, with its
updrafts and downdrafts, until the storms died down Monday night
and the check settled to earth over western New York.''
   Ms. Andrus said the check was in surprisingly good condition.
``It had the stub on it and everything,'' she said.
   Because the check was found in an area where low-level
radioactive waste is stored underground, it was tested for
radioactivity and found to be safe before being mailed back to
Yaroma, she said.

   Sarah Brady said she learned the invaluable role
loved ones play in the care and curing of the critically ill
following her husband's disabling injuries sustained during an
assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   ``It really can be a wonderful experience,'' she said Thursday
at a gathering of the American Associaton of Critical Care Nurses.
   Mrs. Brady said straight talk and compassion from the staff at
George Washington University Hospital, where White House Press
Secretary Jim Brady and Reagan were rushed after the shooting seven
years ago, made the time in the waiting room bearable.
   Brady was shot in the head by John W. Hinckley Jr., who also
wounded Reagan.
   Brady, once a garrulous, bearish man, is still fighting to
recover from the attack. After three operations and two bouts of
pneumonia, he relies on a cane or wheelchair and can work only a
few hours a week. His doctors say he will never regan use of his
left arm.

<TEXT>
   Business sales climbed 1.9 percent in March,
the largest advance in more than a year, while the buildup of
business inventories slowed, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said total business sales rose to a
seasonally adjusted $479.5 billion in March. It was the largest
advance in 13 months and followed an equally strong 1.1 percent
rise in February.
   Business inventories were up 0.3 percent to $720 billion, the
smallest rise since last August. Inventories had grown by 0.4
percent in February and 0.7 percent in January.
   Analysts said the combination of booming sales and the slowdown
in the growth of inventories should translate into continued
strength in factory orders and production in the months ahead.
   The 0.3 percent rise in inventories included a tiny 0.1 percent
increase in unsold goods at the retail level, a 0.2 percent rise at
the manufacturing level and a 0.6 percent increase at the wholesale
level.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said the fact
that inventories were rising at the wholesale level meant part of
the buildup was occurring in imported goods and thus any needed
production cutbacks in this area would not hurt domestic
manufacturers.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, attributed
the small increase in retail inventories to the success car
manufacturers have had with their sales incentives at reducing
backlogs of new cars.
   The 1.9 percent rise in total sales was the largest increase
since a 4.1 percent jump in February 1987.
   It included a 1.7 percent rise in sales at the retail level.
However, the government reported Thursday that retail sales fell
0.6 percent in April as bad weather and an early Easter cut into
demand.
   Sales in March at the wholesale level were up 0.8 percent, while
sales by manufacturers rose 2.6 percent.
   The combination of rising sales and slower growth in inventories
left the inventory-to-sales ratio at 1.50 in March, down from 1.53
in February. That means that it would take 1.50 months to exhaust
inventories at the March sales pace.

<HEAD>Honest Sanitation Workers Turn in Bundles of Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sanitation workers who found a stash of cash
in a barrel of trash turned in the $48,900 and were rewarded with a
thank you. That's all.
   The garbage collectors are not entitled to a nickel of the loot
_ 410 $100 bills and 158 $50s neatly bound with rubber bands, which
they found during regular pickup rounds Thursday in an alley in the
borough of Queens.
   Under state law, ``if the finder is an officer of New York state
or a public corporation, he or she is not entitled to money found
in the performance of their duty,'' police Sgt. John Clifford said
Friday.
   And instead of kind words, the do-gooders have been ridiculed by
people who think they were chumps to turn in the money.
   ``We have been getting calls that have been derogatory,'' said
Donald Koubek, their supervisor. ``They've been called dummies,
stupid, jerks.''
   The two, who joined the department in 1969 and 1970, have
refused to talk to reporters and their names have been withheld,
according to Vito Turso, a Sanitation Department spokesman.
   ``They have taken their fair share of ribbing from people who
try to second guess what they did,'' Turso said. ``But they did the
right thing. They followed department regulations and they are to
be commended, but at this point they are being commended
anonymously.''
   Koubek admitted it's tough to choose between kind words and cold
cash.
   ``It's what I would call a sanitation worker's dream,'' he said.
``Still, I think most people would turn it in after a little bit of
thought. These guys had no other thought than to turn it in. They
immediately called their garage and I was notified.''
   Koubek said that among co-workers, ``they are getting more
positive (reaction) than negative.''
   So far, no one has claimed the cash, Clifford said.
   There is no indication that the money was ill-gotten: The bills
were not marked, the serial numbers were not consecutive and they
were not counterfeit.
   ``As far as I know it's not ours,'' said Marianne Bosted of the
two bundles of bills that fell out of a trash can Thursday in the
alley behind her house.
   ``I keep saying to my aunt, `Are you sure you weren't saving
this in a box to give to me?' '' Ms. Bosted said.

<HEAD>Program Aims To Spark Youth Interest In Archaeology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While some youngsters plan to be spending
their summer playing at the beach, others will be sifting through
the mud in search of ancient relics, thanks to a program for
budding archaeologists.
   The University of West Florida hopes its 1988 Summer Youth
Archaeology Program will encourage youths to enter the field and
will teach them the basics of literally digging into the past.
   ``It's dirty, but it's also exciting as archaeology gets,'' said
UWF associate anthropology professor Judy Bense, who heads the
school's Office of Archaeological Research.
   ``It isn't pretend or showcase. The most important aspect about
this project for youth is they get a chance to see real
archaeology,'' she said.
   Between June 20 and July 8, 15 to 20 youths will help excavate
and do lab analysis of artifacts recovered from previous digs of
American Indian and European culture sites.
   Pensacola lays claim to being the second-oldest continually
occupied American city, behind St. Augustine, and is rich in
artifacts. Actually, Spaniards settled Pensacola first, in 1559,
but then abandoned it for a few years, letting the title slip to
the Atlantic Coast city, settled six years later.
   The summer session costs $150.
   The program aims to give special attention to students who show
an interest in archaeology as a career, said Ms. Bense, who became
interested in her life's calling when she attended Bay County High
School in Panama City, another Florida Panhandle town.
   ``It had everything to do with the teacher we had,'' she recalls
of her earliest interest. ``He opened our eyes to the fact that
just because you are in Panama City _ which essentially is nowhere
_ and went to Bay County High School, which was a so-so school,
didn't mean you couldn't be an archaeologist.
   ``And there are seven archaeologists with Ph.D.'s from that tiny
little town,'' she said, adding that she hopes to similarly inspire
Pensacola students.
   Ms. Bense said she's optimistic about that happening.
   ``There are a couple that are real young ... that are really
eager beavers ... that I really think may be budding
archaeologists,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two giant pandas from the People's Republic
of China were making their way to the Toledo Zoo on Friday amid an
international war of words over whether the animals were being
exploited.
   Toledo Zoo officials called the dispute a ``slap in the face''
to the Chinese.
   In Washington, U.S. District Judge Norma Johnson refused
Thursday to grant a temporary restraining order being sought by the
World Wildlife Fund and the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums. Those groups sought to prevent the pandas from
being shipped by air from Shanghai.
   But the judge said she would hold a hearing next week on a
preliminary injunction that, if granted, could send the pandas back
to China or restrict how the zoo can display them.
   The pandas, Le Le and Nan Nan, were to arrive in Toledo shortly
after midnight Friday and go on display by May 24. They are
scheduled to spend at least 100 days at the zoo.
   The zoo, which has spent nearly $3 million preparing for their
visit, gave the Chinese about $300,000 in equipment and technical
help in exchange.
   In the suit, the Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Association
said exhibition of the pandas violates an international convention
that prohibits trafficking in endangered species for commerical
purposes.
   ``We think the Fish and Wildlife Service proceeded in a very
hasty and inappropriate manner,'' said Ken Cook, executive director
of the World Wildlife Fund.
   He said the exhibition would increase the demand for such
transactions from other zoos and hurt the effort to breed pandas.
   Meanwhile, The Blade of Toledo reported Friday that a
high-ranking Chinese wildlife official said he might never again
allow pandas to come to the United States without a full apology
from the U.S. government for what he considers a breach of
sincerity and mutual trust.
   The newspaper said Li Gui Ling, secretary general of the China
Wildlife Conservation Association, told members of the Toledo Zoo
delegation traveling with the pandas that he is insulted by policy
questions leveled at China by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The
agency, which issued permits for the visit and was named as a
defendant in the federal court suit, has questioned the way China
uses fees it charges for panda loans.
   The Wildlife Fund has been pressuring the Wildlife Service to
stop what it calls China's rent-a-panda policy until China can
prove it is using those fees for panda conservation efforts.
   At the same time, Edwin Bergsmark, president of the zoo board
and head of the zoo's panda delegation, told The Blade his lawyers
had filed a countersuit against the Wildlife Fund in federal court
in Washington.
   Pandas are the national symbol of China and long have been
regarded by the Chinese as an ultimate gesture of good will, trust
and friendship.

   A 10-year-old schoolyard preacher who said
he'd rather ``get gold and silver up in heaven than an education
down here'' was suspended a fourth time Friday after refusing to
stop proselytizing and go to class.
   Duffey Strode, wearing a black jacket and carrying a zippered
case apparently containing a Bible, spent 20 minutes on the grounds
of Eastfield Elementary School quoting Scripture and hurling
biblical epithets in a steady rain before Assistant Principal
Shirley Ramsey handed out the suspension.
   Duffey's younger siblings, Matthew, 5, and Pepper, 6, also have
been suspended for defying school officials earlier this month in
this western North Carolina town. Their mother, Robin Stode, said
they also will likely be suspended again when they return to school
May 19.
   Mrs. Strode predicted the dispute would wind up in litigation.
   ``It's gone too far now,'' she said, adding that she has
contacted an attorney through the Rutherford Institute, which she
described as a non-profit Christian legal foundation based in
Manassass, Va.
   Mrs. Strode said the family moved to North Carolina in January
1987 after winning a lawsuit against city officials in a
Pennslyvania town who had tried to prevent her husband, David, from
street preaching.
   ``We came here to relax after winning the fight,'' she said of
their earlier legal problems in Chambersburg, Pa. ``All we want is
to have the right, the freedom to preach. We might lose it some day
and we want to preserve it.''
   Strode, a machinist, and the children preached at high school
football games from a pickup truck last fall, and Strode has been
seen proselytizing in business areas around town.
   Mrs. Strode said it was her children's decision to preach.
   ``I told them if they want to go back and preach, that's fine,''
Mrs. Strode said in an interview at home Friday as Duffey and his
sister watched a videocassette of ``The Goonies.'' Matthew stopped
playing with a basketball long enough to nod his head when asked if
he planned to preach again when his suspension ends.
   Earlier, when asked if he felt pressured by parents, Duffey had
said, ``No. They ain't. I want to do it.''
   ``After the first suspension, we asked them to stop preaching
for a couple of days,'' Mrs. Strode said. ``It just about broke
their hearts.''
   The Strodes' battle with Eastfield Elementary began earlier in
the spring. Strode said his sons had preached ``three or four
times'' outside the school before Duffey was suspended on March 29
after refusing to be paddled for a scuffle with three other
students. The fight apparently concerned Duffey's preaching.
   Duffey was suspended a second time for five days for refusing to
stop preaching on April 22. His third suspension, for 10 days, was
April 28.
   Mrs. Ramsey said students and teachers alike are showing signs
of stress at Duffey's outbursts, in which he has called faculty
members ``whoremongers,'' ``queers,'' ``fornicators'' and
``adulterers.''
   ``It bothers them (the teachers); it gives the reputation of the
school and their reputation personally as being attacked,'' she
said. ``If I had to go into a classroom right after that, I'm
afraid I wouldn't be worth a great deal.''
   She said parents have told her their children come home feeling
upset. She also said the boy's behavior Friday may have been fanned
by media attention.
   Duffey arrived Friday morning by bicycle in a pouring rain to
about 40 reporters and camermen awaiting his arrival and two
satellite dishes erected on the front lawn.
   When Mrs. Ramsey asked him to enter the school, he began:
   ``Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. Thou
shalt not commit adultery! You're guilty! Even your eyes are filled
with adultery! Men can't keep their eyes off women and women can't
keep their eyes off men. Adulterers shall be put to death and their
blood shall be upon them!''
   Ignoring further pleas to come inside, he said, ``I'd rather get
gold and silver up in heaven than an education down here.''
   His mother told him to go inside and hand in his homework, which
he did, emerging five minutes later with the letter of suspension.
   The letter did not mention preaching but said Duffey was
suspended for being insubordinate, refusing to abide by school
policies, refusing to go along with Mrs. Ramsey into the school and
disruptive behavior.
   Mrs. Strode said the letter gave no indication about what future
action would be taken against Duffey if he continued preaching upon
his return.
   ``I guess the same thing will happen,'' she said.

<HEAD>Huge International Effort Needed To Resettle Afghan Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helping the world's largest population of
refugees return to their homes in Afghanistan will require a
mammoth international effort against huge logistical and political
odds, according to a congressional study of the problem.
   ``The transition will be complex and problematic, but
possible,'' concludes the report from the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration and refugees.
   Sunday marks the official beginning of the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan under accords signed April 14 in Geneva,
which subcommittee chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called
``the first glimmer of peace for the people of Afghanistan in
nearly nine years.''
   The accords call for half the Soviet troops to be pulled out of
Afghanistan by Aug. 15, and for the pullout to be completed by Feb.
15, 1989.
   The congressional report said it was likely that no major
movement of the estimated 5 million refugees who fled their country
into Pakistan and Iran would occur before this fall or next spring.
   ``For the very reason refugees flee their homelands _ conflict,
violence and political strife _ they are not likely to return until
those conditions are resolved,'' the report stated.
   The panel hailed Pakistan's program to handle the refugees,
including support from the United Nations, and said it easily could
be converted into a repatriation mechanism. But it will face major
challenges in providing food supplies, seeds and farm implements
and medical care inside Afghanistan.
   ``Therefore the U.N. and the international community must be
prepared to function within Afghanistan to the maximum degree
possible, even in the absence of clear governmental authority,''
the committee concluded.
   It noted that the political situation was likely to remain
volatile and that the current Soviet-backed regime of Najib may
resist repatriation, particularly since most refugees oppose the
government.
   Some Afghan resistance leaders also may hinder the relocation
efforts in an attempt to use the refugees as political leverage,
the panel said.
   Costs of such a large-scale repatriation program have been
estimated from as low as $46 million to a high of $1.5 billion, the
report noted. The United Nations has put the cost of returning 2
million refugees _ the number expected to participate in a U.N.
program _ at about $226 million.
   Working to the advantage of the repatriation effort is the fact
that some 80 percent of the refugees previously resided within
about 150 miles of the border in rural, agrarian communities.
   ``The vast majority of the refugees will return to retill the
lands their families have farmed for generations,'' the report
noted.
   ``It is likely that many refugees will be able simply to walk
home,'' it said.
   But the challenges are daunting, the subcommittee said.
Officials in the region are particularly concerned about large
numbers of land mines and other explosives still buried throughout
Afghanistan.
   And roads needed to haul supplies and food to returnees, and the
irrigation systems needed to support agriculture once they return,
will have to be rebuilt, it said.

<TEXT>
   After two delays, scientists successfully
detonated a powerful nuclear weapon Friday 1,500 feet beneath the
desert floor at the Nevada Test Site.
   The third announced nuclear test of the year went without
incident, shaking the remote desert site 85 miles northwest of Las
Vegas and registering 5.0 on the Richter scale at the National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   ``It was pretty good-sized, but some register as much as 6.0,''
said Bill Schmieder, a geophysicist at the center.
   The weapons-related test had a yield of up to 150 kilotons, the
largest allowed under existing treaties with the Soviet Union.
   The Energy Department said the test went smoothly, with no
apparent release of radiation.
   ``It appears to be a success,'' said department spokeswoman
Barbara Yoerg. ``Everything was contained underground.''
   Ms. Yoerg said ground motion from the explosion was not felt at
the blast's command center, 13 miles from ground zero.
   Seven Soviet scientists, who are staying at the site while
preparing for joint verification experiments sometime this summer,
were not allowed to monitor the blast, the spokeswoman said. They
stayed in Mercury, a small settlement 40 miles away.
   The Energy Department had warned managers of high-rise buildings
in Las Vegas, about 85 miles away, to keep workers out of
precarious positions because of possible ground motion.
   The weapon was buried 1,500 feet beneath the surface of Yucca
Flat when detonated at 8:35 a.m. It was classified as having a
yield of between 20 and 150 kilotons.
   The test was initially set for Wednesday but was delayed a day
because of winds. It was postponed again Thursday after a security
safeguard designed to prevent accidental explosion froze and
scientists were unable to detonate the weapon.
   Five demonstrators gathered at a boundary to the site, about 45
miles from ground zero, to protest the test. Ms. Yoerg said the
demonstration was peaceful.
   The blast, code-named Shellbourne, was the third announced test
of the year at the nation's nuclear proving grounds and the 678th
since testing at the desert site began in 1951.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   A ground quake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' quake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<HEAD>New Premier Says France Must Call Assembly Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>ASsociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard said Friday that
National Assembly elections must be called soon because centrist
leaders are refusing to support his new government.
   ``I have the feeling that we should hardly delay,'' Rocard told
a news conference. He said President Francois Mitterrand,
re-elected Sunday to a seven-year term, had not yet decided whether
to dissolve the assembly and call early elections.
   In a television interview later, Rocard said Mitterrand would
``finish his consultations'' on the question Saturday _ an
indication that a decision could come over the weekend.
   The constitution gives the president the power to dissolve the
assembly and call new elections.
   ``If we do not dissolve, that would mean the government of the
French Republic does not have a majority,'' Rocard told Antenne 2
television.
   The current 577-member assembly, elected for five years in March
1986, has a center-right majority that backed the conservative
government of Jacques Chirac, who resigned Tuesday after losing the
presidential election to Mitterrand.
   Before the election, Mitterrand had said he wanted a new
Socialist-led government to try to work with the current assembly.
   But Rocard said he sought support from centrists in the assembly
for his new government ``and received a public negative response.''
   The leadership of the centrist Union for French Democracy
decided at a meeting this week to stay aligned with the right.
   The Socialists control only 211 seats, so Rocard's government
would be constantly in danger of falling if it lost an important
vote.
   There was increasing speculation that elections could be held in
mid-June, the first possible date.
   The calendar leaves barely two weeks for the decision. If the
two-round elections are to be held before the end of June,
Mitterrand must dissolve the assembly before May 30.
   No one seriously considers holding elections during the
traditional vacation months of July and August, when many French
people leave home for weeks and pay little attention to the news.
   The newly-appointed French Cabinet, dominated by senior
Socialist Party leaders, joined Rocard for the first time at the
presidential Elysee Palace on Friday. Mitterrand appointed his
Cabinet on Thursday night amid speculation that it was transitional
and would not last.
   All key posts went to well-known Socialists, many of them
members of the previous Socialist government in power from 1981 to
1986.
   Of the 26 full ministers, 17 are Socialists.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said Mitterrand had wanted to draw
centrists into the government but leading centrists, wary of
participating in a Socialist government, had declined Cabinet posts.
   Mitterrand and Rocard managed to woo over only three centrists _
two ministers and a deputy minister _ none with a significant
political base of his own.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand TWA's $48 Million Judgment Against Summa Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice Friday refused to
block a $48.35 million judgment awarded Trans World Airlines
against a company formerly run by the late Howard Hughes.
   Justice William J. Brennan denied an emergency request by Summa
Corp. and William R. Lummis, administrator of the Hughes estate, to
suspend the judgment pending a formal appeal to the full court.
   The Delaware Supreme Court on April 4 upheld the award in a case
that began in 1962.
   Summa Corp., formerly called Hughes Tool Co. or Toolco, owned 78
percent of the stock of TWA when it was sued by other TWA
shareholders.
   The minority shareholders said TWA, which Hughes founded, was
denied an opportunity to be competitive and profitable because
Toolco refused to allow the airline to purchase its own jets in the
1950s. TWA was forced to lease jets and buy some from Toolco, the
suit said.
   ``For reasons clearly attributable to the eccentric or
idiosyncratic business methods of Howard Hughes, TWA was unable to
establish a jet fleet as quickly as its competitors,'' the Delaware
Supreme Court ruled.
   It upheld a lower court ruling that awarded TWA more than $17.2
million plus interest of about $31.1 million.
   The case is Summa Corp. vs. TWA, A-859.

<HEAD>Some Steelworks Strikers Reported Freed; Journalists Warned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two people detained last week in
the police raid that ended a strike at the Lenin steelworks in
southern Poland have been freed, a spokesman at a church
sympathetic to the strikers said Friday.
   Sixteen others are believed still in custody, said the spokesman
for the ``Solidarity congregation'' at St. Maksymilian Kolbe Church
in Nowa Huta, just outside Krakow.
   The government, meanwhile, told a group of Western journalists
who entered the strikebound Lenin shipyard in Gdansk that they will
lose permission to work in Poland if such an incident occurs again.
   Police raided the steelworks in Nowa Huta before dawn on May 5,
and authorities said 38 people were detained.
   Six people were freed Thursday and one on Friday, said the
church spokesman, who asked that his name not be used.
   He said 15 people were freed last weekend after 48 hours'
detention and fined up to $202 by a misdemeanor court.
   He said six people were considered under arrest, which allows
them to be held for up to two months under arrest warrants. The
remaining 10 people in custody have been sentenced by misdemeanor
courts to two to four weeks' imprisonment, he said.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak paid visits to the sites of
the two longest strikes during Poland's wave of labor unrest that
began April 25 and ended Tuesday.
   Kiszczak, a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers
(communist) Party, Friday visited the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, the
official PAP news agency said. A strike there ended Tuesday after
strikers voluntarily left without a settlement.
   The strike had been for higher pay and for recognition of a
local chapter of Solidarity, the trade union federation.
   While in Gdansk, Kiszczak met with shipyard managers and
representatives of various official workers' groups as well as
Gdansk Roman Catholic Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski.
   On Thursday, Kiszczak met with management and workers at the
steelworks in Nowa Huta, PAP said. He also met with Cardinal
Franciszek Macharski, archbishop of Krakow.
   In Warsaw, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which accredits
foreign journalists in Poland, warned representatives of six news
organizations _ The Associated Press, Reuters, Deutsche Presse
Agentur, the Financial Times of London, Newsweek magazine and the
West German television station ARD.
   The government said it was illegal to enter the shipyard without
a pass issued by management, and that taking photographs in the
shipyard is banned by signs posted on its grounds.
   The 10 journalists employed by the six organizations entered the
shipyard on Monday morning and emerged together through a side gate
about four hours later. They were detained by police immediately
upon leaving the shipyard, held for about 2{ hours and released
after questioning.
   Film, tape recordings and some notes of the journalists were
confiscated.
   The group included six Poles employed by the Western news
organizations, one German, one Briton, one American and one
Yugoslavian.

<HEAD>Workers Hired By Farmers Up This Spring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers hired by farmers is up
this spring, and so are their wages, an Agriculture Department
report said Friday.
   A survey last month indicated 958,000 hired workers were
employed by farmers, compared with 885,000 in the comparable period
of April 1987.
   Those did not include 224,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. Those were up from
188,000 a year earlier, the report said.
   Field work was hampered in some parts of the country by rain and
wet ground when the survey was taken during the week of April
10-16, the report said. But corn planting was getting under way in
most major production states and was about 6 percent completed by
the end of the week.
   Planting of cotton, spring wheat and other crops also took place
during the week surveyed.
   ``Lettuce harvest was just beginning in Salinas, Calif., and was
very active in the San Joaquin Valley,'' the report said. ``Harvest
of cantaloups, watermelons and honeydew melons progressed well in
Arizona. Florida's valencial orange harvest continued, and
grapefruit movement was strong.''
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 4.5 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5 per
hour, up from $4.90 a year earlier, the report said.
   For those workers provided by contractors, there was no national
wage rate available. However, workers in California averaged $5.68
per hour, down from $6.15 a year ago, while those in Florida
received an average of $6.15 per hour in April, up from $5.85 a
year ago, the report said.

<HEAD>Spanish Priest Faces Trial On Drug Trafficking Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Spanish priest and a defrocked
comrade face drug trafficking charges in Venezuela's first
narcotics smuggling case involving a Catholic Church official,
newspapers reported Friday.
   Authorities said Father Jose Luis Gil Fernandez, arrested with
45 pounds of the drug, told them the thousands of dollars he made
from earlier drug sales were spent on his chapel, school and
charity.
   Judge Francisco Caracciolo Lamus of the 40th Penal Court in
Caracas issued an arrest warrant late Thursday charging Gil
Fernandez, 57, former priest Jose Rojano Martinez, 54, and
Martinez' wife, Graciela de Rojano, 46, with trafficking in illegal
drugs, local newspapers reported.
   The defendants could each be sentenced to 10 to 20 years in jail
if convicted.
   ``The investigation is still open regarding other (suspects) and
the circumstances of the events,'' El Universal newspaper quoted
Caracciolo quoted as saying.
   Gil Fernandez was detained by police April 26 as he prepared to
board a plane for Madrid at Maiquetia International Airport outside
Caracas. More than 45 pounds of cocaine were found in his baggage.
   Rojano Martinez and his wife were detained hours later in a
Caracas residence. Police seized an apparently false passport and
four false $100 bills from the house but did not find drugs.
   The Spanish-born Gil Fernandez was parish priest in San Mateo, a
small town 35 miles west of Caracas, for 24 years.
   Following his detention he confessed to having carried drugs to
Spain on two previous occasions since 1984, officials said. He said
the money he received, around $41,000, was invested in the parish
chapel and school and in charity for poor parishioners.
   Initial investigations show the priest traveled repeatedly to
the United States, Panama, the Dominican Republic and several
European countries since 1980, Caracciolo said.
   Police are also investigating a travel agency in Maracay, the
city nearest San Mateo, that Gil Fernandez may own, Caracciolo said.
   The three suspects were being held in separate Caracas jails.

<HEAD>Judge Concerned About Cross Erected on Hawaii Marine Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge voiced concern Friday over
whether a 65-foot Latin cross erected more than 20 years ago at a
Marine base in Hawaii is an unconstitutional endorsement of
religion by government.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan made no ruling on a lawsuit
against the cross' presence at Camp H.M. Smith, but he expressed
doubts about the government's contention it served the purely
secular purpose or honoring Marines killed in the Vietnam war or
are missing in action.
   ``The court has concerns over the legitimacy of the cross,''
Hogan said at the conclusion of a hearing on the issue. ``There is
not a case where a cross has ever been accepted'' by federal courts
as a permissible symbol on government property.
   The Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. contends that the wooden
cross on a prominent point at the Marine base violates the
Constitution's ban on governmental endorsement of a particular
religion.
   The group's lawyer, Ronald Koerner, said the Latin cross cannot
be considered a secular object because it is the ``symbol of the
passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.''
   ``It is one of the great ironies of the case that the government
has taken a profoundly religious symbol to devout Christians and
turned it into a secular symbol,'' Koerner said.
   ``Here a particular religion or a particular view is accepted, a
minority religion's view is disregarded,'' he said. Non-Christian
war dead are not honored by the cross, he added.
   ``Will non-Christian people have the right not to enter military
service because they are accorded no respect, honor and dignity?''
Koerner said.
   Justice Department attorney Frederick Morgan did not deny the
religious significance of the Latin cross, but he said ``the
history of the memorial is clear; it was erected as a secular
monument.''
   Although courts have ruled that Latin crosses on government
property are impermissible, Morgan said the Hawaii case is
different because it involves a cross that is part of a war
memorial.
   ``There is no religious purpose here,'' he said.
   But Morgan conceded under questioning by Judge Hogan that his
argument would be harder to prove if the cross were a crucifix _ a
representation of Christ on the cross that is a common symbol in
the Roman Catholic Church.
   Hogan noted a Marine press release issued in 1983 stated that
the original cross was built in 1966 for an Easter sunrise service.
But Morgan questioned the accuracy of the press release, which he
said was disavowed in deposition testimony by Marine officials,
including a former base chaplain.
   Hogan also noted that the press release referred to the cross
being rebuilt, after a fire, in time for it to be lit at Christmas.
   Morgan said the cross, located on a high point of land from
which it can be seen at sea, has become ``a beacon of hope for the
community and a landmark.''
   When there was a move to take it down three years ago, the
Marine base received 3,200 letters from local residents who wanted
cross kept where it was, Morgan said. Only one writer called for
its removal, he said.
   The cross has been a source of controversy for several years.
   In 1985, the Navy's judge advocate general, Rear Adm. Thomas E.
Flynn ruled that the cross' presence on the base was
unconstitutional and recommended that it be removed.
   Marine commanders ordered its removal, but Gen. P.X. Kelley,
then the Marine commandant, countermanded those orders.
   In the margin of a routing slip attached to Flynn's opinion,
Kelley wrote: ``And the cross came crashing down. Victory for the
forces of evil.''
   Kelley, now retired, said during a deposition taken in the case
that he was merely referring to lawyers as the forces of evil.
   Kelley's order keeping the cross was issued after retired Lt.
Gen. Victor Krulak wrote to say he had erected the cross in the
mid-1960s as a monument to Marines killed or missing in action in
Vietnam.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that the city of Pawtucket,
R.I., could erect a creche that depicts the nativity scene in a
park along with other symbols of Christmas such as reindeer.
   Since that decision, however, the high court has left
undisturbed court rulings by federal judges that ordered the
removal of crosses from municipal buildings in St. Charles, La.,
and Birmingham, Ala. In both cases, the lower courts held that the
crosses, which stood alone, were undiluted religious symbols that
should not be displayed on government property.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan plans to nominate Edward
Djerejian, a career foreign service office, to be ambassador to
Syria, the White House announced Friday.
   Djerejian, who will succeed William L. Eagleton pending Senate
confirmation, has been serving as the principal deputy assistant to
the secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs.
   From 1985-86, he was assigned to the White House as a special
assistant to the president for foreign affairs.
   Djerejian's last overseas assignment was in Amman, Jordan, where
he was deputy chief of mission at the American Embassy from 1981-84.
   In other personnel moves, Reagan:
   _Announced his intention to nominate Kenneth P. Bergquist to be
an assistant secretary of the Navy for manpower and reserve affairs
at the Defense Department. He would succeed Charles G. Untermeyer.
   _Said he plans to nominate David C. Chu to be an assistant
secretary of defense for program analysis and evaluation. This is a
new Pentagon position. Since 1981, Chu has been director of program
analysis and evaluation at the Defense Department.
   _Designated Becky Norton Dunlop, deputy under secretary of
interior, as a special representative to deal with relations
between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands.
   _Named Peter M. Robinson to be a special assistant to the
president for speech writing. Since October 1983, Robinson has
served as a speech writer in the White House. Previously, he was
chief speech writer for Vice President George Bush.

<TEXT>
   An American specialist tangled with his
Soviet colleagues Friday over the consequences of telling those
exposed by the Chernobyl nuclear accident that they face a greater
risk of developing cancer.
   ``Many people in Kiev worry about what will happen to them. They
don't want to have children,'' said Robert Gale, a U.S. doctor who
helped treat the sickest victims of the April 26, 1986, accident at
the nuclear power station 80 miles north of here.
   The American specialist, a spectator, spoke at the end of a news
conference by Soviet specialists winding up a three-day meeting on
the medical effects of the accident.
   Gale urged a widespread discussion of the possibility of future
cancer deaths, as well as other medical problems, as a result of
the accident that has already killed 31 people.
   ``I believe a healthy discussion ranging from no effects to
millions of effects ... is good,'' he told the conference
participants.
   An explosion and fire at the No. 4 reactor of the plant exposed
thousands to high levels of radiation and released a cloud of
radioactive material that eventually circled the world.
   Gale said Wednesday that specialists calculated the Chernobyl
accident could add as many as 30,000 cancer deaths to the 600
million expected worldwide in the next 50 years.
   But he stressed the number was based on calculations only. He
said he thought that the projections were high, perhaps even 10
times too high.
   Soviet scientists say they are dealing with a widespread fear
among their citizens about the dangers of nuclear power that they
have termed ``radiophobia,'' and they complain that forecasts like
Gale's contribute to it and threaten the future of the Soviet
nuclear power industry.
   The scientists also acknowledged that rumors of another accident
at the Chernobyl plant sometimes spread around the region.
   Viktor Knizhnikov, head of a Soviet radiation safety laboratory,
said Gale's initial projections of Chernobyl's health consequences,
made on Soviet television after the accident, ``contributed to
anxiety of the people.''
   On Wednesday, Leonid Ilyin, director of the Soviet Institute of
Biophysics, said rejection of nuclear power reflects a ``lack of
understanding of reality of today, when there is no alternative.''
But Gale said the way to control the fear of nuclear power is to
prevent nuclear accidents and nuclear war.
   Soviet nuclear power officials, who were severely criticized in
the West for not providing more timely information about the
Chernobyl accident, also are reeling from sharp criticism published
April 24 in the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   For months, official Soviet publications had nothing but praise
for the cleanup effort at Chernobyl. But Pravda said the plant was
plagued by poor workmanship, nepotism and drunkenness.
   Officials said Friday that some of the criticism was true of
work in the 18-mile exclusion zone around the plant, but not in the
plant itself.
   In another development, a government spokesman said Friday that
the head of a commission that investigated the accident committed
suicide a day after the second anniversary of the disaster.
   The April 27 death of Valery A. Legasov, 52, was unrelated to
his work, said Alexander P. Kovalenko, information hief of the
government agency overseeing the power station in the northern
Ukraine.
   ``Why, only he knew,'' Kovalenko told reporters visiting agency
headquarters. ``His suicide depended on psychology. We should not
connect it with work.''
   Legasov had been praised for his openness in discussing the
accident's causes and effects.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen members of the Friday the 13th club
sought to bring good luck to the Reading Terminal Market Friday by
breaking seven mirrors and dancing under a ladder with raised black
umbrellas.
   ``The idea is to spoof the whole idea of Friday the 13th bad
luck,'' said club member Ed Wohlmuth, who teaches fashion
merchandizing at the Art Institute of Philadelphia.
   But the club, which began its celebration at the market at 12:13
p.m., has its own superstitions.
   Max Buten did only two spins under the ladder with his umbrella.
``Any more than that is bad luck,'' he said.
   Friday's meeting, the club's second this year and 90th since its
founding in 1936, was designed to aid the Reading market, which is
located beneath a huge train barn last used as a commuter rail stop
two years ago.
   ``We want this place to survive,'' Wohlmuth said of the Reading
market, which has been mentioned as the possible site of a
convention center. ``Where else in America do you have a farmer's
market in the middle of a city?''
   Bob Boyle, executive vice president of the Reading Real Estate
Co., which manages the market, joined in the anti-superstition
ceremony. He said he wasn't sure whether the club's antics would
save the market, but he added, ``It can't hurt.''
   The club, founded in 1936 by Philadelphia ad man Harry Klein, is
exclusive. Membership is by invitation only, and is limited to 13.
``You have to wait for somebody to die to get in,'' Wohlmuth said.
   He also said the club has set its own expiration date, Friday
the 13th of October, 1988, ``to give the world a break.''
   Club members conceded bad luck had struck occasionally. Wohlmuth
said the club helped initiate an aquarium in South Philadelphia in
the mid-1960s. The aquarium closed by the end of the year. Then
there was the time they were invited to initiate a new subway
station below the market. ``That night they had stalled trains in
the tunnel,'' recalled member Henry Klein, brother of the founder.
   But who knows. On this Friday the 13th, a City Council committee
recommended limiting city support for the costly convention center.

   Willie B. found it's a jungle out there.
   Zoo Atlanta's famous gorilla saw something Friday he hasn't seen
since he was captured in Africa 27 years ago: green grass beneath
his feet and open sky above his head.
   As reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and
across a protective moat, the 30-year-old lowland gorilla stepped
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters, a $4.5 million simulated
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of
other apes.
   Skeptical of those watching him, he spent almost an hour
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed
secure enough to run atop his hill, scamper for food and begin
ripping down tree limbs.
   ``I think he has responded well. He came through. He seems to be
enjoying his environment,'' beaming Zoo Atlanta Director Terry
Maple said.
   Last month, Willie B. was moved from his tile-walled,
steel-barred cage _ his home since he arrived at the zoo in 1961 _
into the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter.
   After five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure, with his
keeper of 14 years often sleeping nearby to keep him company, he
was allowed to roam free. Zoo officials don't know if he can
remember being outdoors.
   In a physical last month, Willie weighed in at 460 pounds, about
60 pounds overweight, but not too bad after 25 years in a cage,
Maple said.
   For now, Willie will live in an area of his own, adjacent to
three ``families'' of gorillas on loan from Emory University's
Yerkes Primate Research Center. They're all separated to prevent
fights. Zoo officials hope that within a year, he can be introduced
to another gorilla _ probably a female, with whom they hope he'll
breed.
   The new exhibit, according to Zoo Atlanta officials, is the most
advanced gorilla habitat at any zoo. Named the Ford African Rain
Forest and built with $1 million from the automaker, it's the
latest stage in a $26 million renovation at the 99-year-old zoo.
   The exhibit will open to the public June 11.
   Just four years ago, the U.S. Humane Society named the zoo one
of the nation's worst. The U.S. Department of Agriculture slapped
sanctions on the zoo for poor record-keeping on animal care. The
deaths of star animals made national headlines and political
turmoil gripped the city-owned attraction.
   In 1985, Maple, a Georgia Tech animal behavior specialist who
helped turn around the New Orleans zoo, was named director, and
operations were handed to a non-profit agency. Maple took to
calling Zoo Atlanta ``the world's next great zoo,'' and proceeded
to convert the old facility into a modern, natural animal habitat.
   ``It's a great day for Zoo Atlanta,'' Maple said.``As of this
moment we have arrived as a big-league zoo.
   Plans call for a complete renovation by 1991, with animals
roaming in natural habitats rather than cages.
   As for Willie B., Friday was not his first time in the
limelight. In 1981 an Atlanta TV station handed him a suitcase to
recreate a popular luggage commercial which showed an ape bashing _
but not breaking _ the product.
   Willie ripped the leather cover off the suitcase, ripped the two
sides apart from the hinges, filled one half with water and drank
from it.

   Hearings into a fatal train wreck raised
serious questions on working conditions and equipment safety in the
rail industry, a ranking National Transportation Safety Board
official said Friday.
   James L. Kolstad, the board's vice chairman who's heading a
panel investigating the Jan. 14 Conrail accident in Thompsontown,
said new testimony and data from previous accidents ``clearly
suggest that irregular and unpredictable shift work is
fatigue-producing and detrimental to safe railroad operations.''
   The board will issue a report in about seven months on the
accident, in which two trains collided head-on, killing the
engineer and brakeman on both.
   Scheduling train dispatchers without work breaks also is unsafe,
Kolstad said as three days of hearings concluded.
   Early in the hearings, witnesses said dispatchers often cannot
leave their computers to eat or go to the bathroom because no one
else is experienced enough to relieve them.
   R. B. Hasselman, a Conrail vice president, said the company
indeed promotes safety in its scheduling practices.
   And Pat Linskey, a Conrail spokeswoman in Philadelphia, cited
exhibits submitted to the board that the engineer and the brakeman
on the one train that apparently ran a stop sign before the
accident both had had a break of nearly 38 hours since their
previous work assignment.
   An industrial psychologist said during the hearings that he
reviewed the crew's work schedules and concluded they were overly
tired and fell asleep while running the train.
   Kolstad also called on the industry to improve the working
environment and safety of locomotive cabs, adding, ``Industry
studies have been under way for improvements in these areas without
producing significant results.''
   He said a committee representing the interests of industry,
unions and the federal government has failed to initiate any
substantial safety changes in locomotive cabs.
   Donald Lindsey, vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, said recommendations for important safety changes ``have
fallen on deaf ears.''
   Lindsey said train manufacturers should improve the interior cab
by decreasing the noise level to prevent hearing loss, changing the
heating and cooling systems, and padding the interior to better
protect employees in case of an accident. He said locomotives also
need exterior changes such as stronger and larger crash equipment
and measures to prevent the cab from being crushed if it rolls over
during an accident.
   ``The companies don't want to put the money out,'' Lindsey said
after his testimony. ``It would range anywhere from $6,000 to
$16,000 for each cab and the industry doesn't want to spend that
kind of money.
   William Bogett, an official with General Motors, which makes
locomotives, said the committee on improving locomotive cabs is
well-intended but often makes recommendations that are unrealistic.
   He said the committee has been ``asked to do the impossible'' _
make a high-speed locomotive withstand the impact of another
locomotive.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-eight members of Congress have joined in
a protest to Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko over his banishment
of a prominent opposition leader to internal exile.
   A letter circulated by Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., urged
Mobutu to rescind his banishment of Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, who was
sent last month to a remote town in northeastern Zaire.
   ``This internal exile is a clear violation of internationally
recognized civil and political rights,'' the letter said. It was
dated May 3 and made available Friday by the Rainbow Lobby, which
has been pushing to reverse the U.S. policy of support for Mobutu.
   Tshisekedi, a former interior minister who now leads the
opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress, was seized
April 8 after writing a letter calling Mobutu the ``Zairian
Caligula,'' a reference to the Roman despot.
   The letter criticized Mobutu for failing to implement promises
of greater democracy.

<TEXT>
   American jazz trumpeter Chet
Baker, famed for his 1950s appearances with Gerry Mulligan, died
Friday after falling from the second floor of his Amsterdam hotel.
   Baker, 59, fell from the hotel window shortly after 3:10 a.m.
and was found dead in the street by police, according to Amsterdam
police spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   No precise reason for Baker's fall was disclosed.
   Baker was scheduled to make several appearances as part of a
tour of the Netherlands.
   The jazz trumpeter was born Chesney Baker in Yale, Okla., in
December 1929. His early career contained phenomenal luck which
turned very sour.
   Famed for the thin, cool tone of his trumpet playing, Baker set
the the standard for what jazz buffs knew as the ``cool school.''
   In 1952, he was working with Charlie Parker on the West Coast
when he joined Mulligan, a baritone saxaphonist, and the rest of
his piano-less quartet.
   In 1953, Baker topped the Metronome trumpet poll and started his
own quartet. His work became more assured and outgoing. In 1955 he
took a group to Europe that showed high promise. Then his career
started to suffer, from narcotics, arrests, headlines and a
backlash against the fact he'd been overrated at the beginning.
   He had a cult following in the 1950s, because of his good looks
and youth and his fragile and introverted tone. He looked something
like James Dean and sounded something like Bix Beiderbecke. As a
player, Miles Davis was his main inspiration.
   In recent years, Baker said he had stopped taking drugs and
started making records again, appearing on an Elvis Costello album.
   He sang sometimes in a rather weak voice but was appealing to
female audiences.
   In San Francisco in 1968, Baker he was the victim of a beating
by hoodlums and suffered severe injuries that included loss of his
teeth, a terrible thing for a trumpet player. For two years he
didn't play.
   In 1974, critic John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times that
had developed ``more range and assertivedness within the wistfully
ruminative style with which he has also been associated.''

   The Soviets have lost control of a
nuclear-powered military spy satellite, and two American experts
said Friday it will shower the Earth with radioactive debris.
   The satellite, Kosmos 1900, ``has been in a steadily decaying
orbit for the last month. If nothing is done to correct its orbit,
it will decay'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, said Maj. Alex
Mondragon, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command, in Colorado
Springs, Colo.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that Kosmos 1900
has a nuclear power plant aboard and would fall to Earth in August
or September, but that the radioactive material on board would not
present a danger.
   However, two American experts on the Soviet space program, James
Oberg and Nicholas Johnson, said it was unlikely that the
radioactive material would burn up on re-entering the atmosphere,
as Tass implied.
   ``It is a certainty that the radioactive debris will come down.
The question is where,'' said Johnson, author of the annual study,
``Soviet Year in Space.'' He said it was likely to fall in the
ocean or in a sparsely populated area.
   ``We will know the date a few weeks before, but we won't know
the exact time or general area until a few hours before,'' Johnson
said. The orbit of Kosmos 1900 covers the Earth between 65 degrees
south and north latitude, excluding only Antarctica in the south
and a swath in the north bounded by the inhabited areas of Alaska,
Greenland, Scandanavia and Siberia.
   Johnson and Oberg said the satellite is believed to have a
system to eject the reactor core so that it would burn up rather
than reach Earth. But that safety system did not activate after the
Soviets lost contact with Kosmos 1900, between April 10 and April
14, Johnson said in an interview.
   ``You could set that system up on a fail-safe system'' to eject
as soon as the satellite stopped working, he said, ``but it would
have activated shortly after the malfunction.''
   Neither Tass nor the U.S. Space Command spokesman described the
mission of Kosmos 1900, but Oberg and Johnson said it was a RORSAT,
an English-language designation which stands for Radar Ocean
Reconnaissance Satellite. They are used to monitor the movement of
U.S. warships.
   Two other Soviet RORSATS have fallen to earth.
   In January 1978, Kosmos 954, powered by 110 pounds of uranium,
re-entered the atmosphere and spread radioactive debris across
Canada. The class was then redesigned to allow the reactor to be
jettisoned so that it would not have the protection of the
satellite body as it re-entered the atmosphere and thus would be
more likely to burn up.
   One of the newly designed RORSATS, Kosmos 1402, dropped from
orbit on Jan. 25, 1983 over the Indian Ocean, and no radioactive
debris is known to have fallen to Earth.
   In the case of Kosmos 1402, said Johnson, ``the core was ejected
very shortly after the malfunction,'' in contrast to the current
situation.
   A top Soviet space scientist, Roald Sagdeyev, told a news
conference in Washington that Kosmos 1900 was designed so that the
radioactive material would vaporize and remain in orbit. But he
said he had been in the United States for several weeks and did not
have fresh information on Kosmos 1900.
   Sagdeyev, who is director of the Soviet Space Research Institute
and an adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was appearing
with the private Federation of American Scientists to urge a ban on
nuclear reactors in orbit.
   Sagdeyev and Frank von Hippel of the American federation said
that the proposal was aimed largely at crippling the U.S. ``Star
Wars'' program, which many scientists say would use nuclear
reactors to power lasers and other exotic weapons to knock down
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   Sagdeyev said the only knowledge he had of the RORSAT program
came from what he read in Western publications.
   The Tass announcement, made available by the agency's office in
Washington, said that ``the artificial earth satellite Kosmos 1900,
with a nuclear power plant aboard, was launched Dec. 12, 1987.
   ``According to competent Soviet oranizations, radio contact with
the satellite was lost in April 1988. The satellite is continuing
in its oriented flight, and the main service systems are
functioning according to the program.
   ``The satellite will fly in orbit until August-September 1988,
after which it will cease to exist. The satellite Kosmos 1900 has
systems insuring radiation safety on completion of the flight,''
Tass said.
   The Soviets have launched about 50 RORSATs. Two of them have
fallen to earth, Kosmos 1900 is on the way down, while Kosmos 1824
remains in low orbit. The remainder have been boosted into higher
orbit where there is less danger they will fall, acording to Oberg
and Johnson.
   Oberg and Johnson said the Soviets apparently have developed a
new type of ocean reconnaissance satellite, a follow-on to RORSAT,
one that uses solar rather than nuclear power.
   The development of a RORSAT replacement that does not rely on
nuclear power would explain the Soviet decision to call for a ban
on reactors in orbit.
   ``They are willing to give up something they are about the scrap
in return for something we have not built,'' said Oberg.

   British traitor and master spy Harold ``Kim''
Philby was buried in a Moscow cemetery Friday with full military
honors after being praised as a courageous man who did his utmost
to defend the Soviet Union.
   Four speakers eulogized Philby, calling him ``Comrade Kim,'' and
lauding him as an outstanding agent of the KBG, the Soviet
espionage and state security police.
   Double agent Philby, 76, died on Wednesday in Moscow, his home
since he fled the West in 1963.
   BBC radio correspondent Jeremy Harris, who attended Philby's
funeral at Kuntsevo Cemetery in western Moscow, said the red-draped
coffin was open and the body was dressed in a dark suit and red tie.
   A 12-member honor guard from the Soviet border police fired a
volley of shots in salute as the coffin was lowered into the grave,
Harris said.
   Philby's fourth wife, a Soviet, wept.
   While spying for Moscow as a mole inside British intelligence,
Philby sent many Western agents to their deaths. The British secret
service valued him so highly that at one time it was considering
him for the top job, chief of MI6.
   For his services to the Soviet Union, Philby was awarded the
nation's highest decoration, the Order of Lenin, and other medals.
   Philby told Radio Moscow last November that he wanted to be
buried in the Soviet Union, ``which I consider to be my country
since the 1930s.''
   The official Tass news agency on Thursday praised Philby as a
``remarkable Soviet intelligence officer'' who accomplished
seemingly impossible feats to defend the Soviet Union and the world
progressive movement against Western spies.

   A former thrift executive has been sentenced to
four years in prison for embezzling more than $1 million and
donating some of it to gay charities in the mistaken belief he was
about to die of AIDS.
   ``I made an awful mistake, and now I'm trying to live with it,''
said Patrick Wayne Debenport, sentenced Thursday by U.S. District
Judge Barefoot Sanders.
   Debenport, 27, former manager of First Texas Savings and Loan's
Oak Cliff branch, was charged in March with 15 counts of
misapplication of funds after an FBI investigation found $1.1
million missing.
   Under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to three counts, and the
rest were dropped. Debenport, who admitted stealing the $1.1
million, had faced up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
   Debenport said his five-month embezzling spree began in 1987
after he was told he had AIDS and just three months to live. Later,
he found he had only tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus
but did not have the disease.
   The former bank manager said he had used the thrift's computer
system to transfer 15 bogus loans to his bank account in suburban
Mesquite.
   He used most of the money to buy a new home, a car and other
luxuries but donated $175,000 to the People With AIDS Coalition to
help buy a home for AIDS victims and gave $20,000 to a church.
   Thrift officials say most of the money has been recovered except
for the $175,000 that Debenport gave to the AIDS charity.
   Coalition directors said they did not know the money was stolen
and have already spent it to renovate the city's only home for AIDS
patients. The thrift has sued the coalition for repayment.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels proposed Friday
a resumption of talks with the U.S.-supported government on ending
the civil war that began 8{ years ago.
   Roberto Viera, a spokesman for President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
said the government had not received formal notification of the
offer.
   In a statement distributed to news media, the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front guerrilla coalition and the political
Democratic Revolutionary Front suggested the first meeting be held
May 30-31.
   They said Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the Roman Catholic
archibshop of San Savlador, should act as a mediator.
   The statement did not suggest a site for the meeting, but
proposed that it include delegates of Duarte's administration, the
national legislature and the armed forces.
   It called the proposal ``a contribution to the search for a
political solution to the crisis'' in El Salvador.
   Several meetings have been held since 1984 between the rebels
and Duarte administration, with Rivera Damas and other church
leaders mediating, but accomplishing nothing.
   The rebels broke off the last talks in October after a prominent
human rights activist was killed. Human rights groups and the
church say most of the 65,000 people killed in the civil war were
civilian victims of rightist death squads or paramilitary forces.
   Friday's statement proposed a meeting with an open agenda ``to
discuss ... concrete measures for ending the armed conflict,
together with measures to give continuity to this effort and
incorporate all the nation's sectors into a dialogue.''

   Redford said the agreements resulted from meetings he had in the

   He also moderated a two-day conference in Moscow on depletion of
the ozone later in the the upper atmosphere.
   Redford said the first conference, dealing with ecology, will be
held this fall at his Institute for Resource Management in
Sundance, Utah, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences has agreed to
exchange information with the institute.
   Two Soviet movie makers will visit his Sundance Institute for
Independent Filmmakers in 1989 to confer with American

   He told reporters about the ecological exchange: ``It seems very
appropriate that these two countries with their experts should take
a leadership role, determining the correct information to be
presented to the public.''

   A judge on Friday ordered six people
executed for the murders of two boys killed in an occult ritual
intended to bring the defendants better political jobs.
   Criminal Court Judge George Tulay set May 27 as the date for
hanging.
   Defense lawyers won a stay of execution, however, when the
Supreme Court agreed to review the case. The high court set no
hearing date.
   The defendants included David Clarke, a former county boss of
the governing National Democratic Party of Liberia, and former
county attorney Faikai Bedell.
   All six were convicted of the October 1986 murders of Samuel
Johnson, 6, and Emmanuel Daliah, 7. The boys were killed in Harper,
490 miles east of the capital city of Monrovia.
   According to trial testimony, parts of the victims' body were
used to make charms that were supposed to guarantee the defendants
high positions in the government and the party in power.
   Police arrested the defendants by using an occult practitioner
of their own known as Madam Mary. Ten years earlier, she helped
police track down and convict seven people in the same county in
the ritual killing of a musician.
   The seven were hanged.

combustion among and lye-soaked bundles of straw placed along the
barn.
   The blaze also destroyed an older farmhouse, two silos and a

   The governors of Mississippi, Louisiana
and Arkansas signed an agreement aboard a Mississippi River barge
Friday to wage war on poverty in the region and work together to
woo foreign business.
   Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi said the three states for too long
had left untapped the potential of their rich Delta areas and ``not
claimed our fair share of the prosperity that is America.''
   ``If we are successful, the country succeeds,'' Mabus said. ``We
cannot have a truly vibrant country if we have pockets of despair,
if there are places which do not fully share in the American
dream.''
   Mabus, along with Govs. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana and Bill
Clinton of Arkansas, signed an agreement to work together to
``promote friendly and working relations with foreign countries in
the areas of international trade, industry, technology and tourism,
education and culture.''
   Their pact also aims to improve conditions in the impoverished
agricultural flatlands along the river. The governors did not
specify how they would fight poverty and said the details would be
worked out later.
   ``Together we can do so much more. Our problems are bigger than
a single state,'' Roemer said.
   Political and business leaders and Japanese ambassador Nobuo
Matsunaga joined the governors for the barge trip from the port of
Rosedale to the main river channel, where the agreements were
signed.
   The governors said the agreements would not end competition
among the three states but represented a realization that big
investors decide first on a region and then a specific site.
   ``We have always assumed that if Mississippi won something,
Arkansas lost it,'' Clinton said. ``That is not so. States in good
shape are parts of regions in good shape.''
   ``We can do so much as a team. We are too poor to compete
individually,'' Mabus said.

   The King of the Witches for 25 years is dead and
his designated heir has fled.
   So the Witchcraft Council of Elders, which claims 100,000
members in Britain and thousands of adherents worldwide, voted
unanimously not to pick a successor.
   Alex Sanders was the first formal King of the Witches in about
500 years, said council spokesman, High Priest Nigel Bourne.
   The witch king, who died earlier this month at age 61, decreed
in a tape recording played at his funeral that his 16-year-old son,
Victor, should succeed him as king, said his widow, Maxine.
   But his son apparently has no interest in the job and has gone
to live with friends in the United States, she said.
   In any case, she suggested, perhaps a king is no longer needed.
The Council of Elders voted to that effect Thursday night.
   ``In the old days you had a king of witches because the crops
wouldn't grow, because the country was in danger or at war, or
something like that,'' she said.
   ``After a period of seven years he would be sacrificed. In
modern times we don't sacrifice them, but nobody in their right
mind wants the job. ... It is not necessary at this time. The crops
are doing very nicely, the babies are doing nicely.''
   The Sanders family clearly regard their brand of witchcraft as
the white, or benevolent, sort.
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, told the
House of Commons last month that he believed witchcraft was
sweeping the country and endangering children. He said many people
convicted of offenses against children had been involved in
witchcraft initiation ceremonies.

<HEAD>U.S. Rabbi Bids East Berlin Jewish Community Farewell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. rabbi, who drew the ire of Communist
officials and Jewish leaders during his eight months as Jewish
spiritual leader in East Germany, said Friday he was leaving East
Berlin with ``mixed feelings.''
   Rabbi Isaac Neuman, 65, took over the post in September 1987,
after retiring as rabbi in Champaign, Ill.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Neuman had criticized
East German news media coverage of recent events in Israel. He also
attacked leaders of East Berlin's Jewish community, saying they had
thwarted his work.
   The state-run media later attacked Neuman, saying East Germany
did not tolerate anti-Semitism.
   Neuman told East Berlin Jews Friday night he had had
disagreements with people within the community ``who had different
views about Judaism.''
   He said he hoped that those involved in the disputes had not
been hurt.
   Neuman, who said two weeks ago he was returning to the United
States on May 16, said Friday, ``I am leaving with mixed feelings.
Not everything was wonderful, but not everything was bad either.''
   Neuman was the first rabbi to take over the East German post in
more than 20 years.
   The East German Jewish community has less than 350 officially
registered members and about 100 people ``on the fringes,'' Neuman
said.
   Some estimates say there are as many as 2,500 other Jews in East
Germany who are non-practicing.
   East Berlin has the largest number of Jews, with other
communities in Halle, Leipzig and Dresden.

<HEAD>Producers Wheel and Deal Soviet TV Ad Time out of Remote Farmhouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLRAIN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The agents who made the deal that will
bring singer Michael Jackson to 150 million Soviet television
viewers via Pepsi Cola ads operate out of a 200-year-old farmhouse
on a dirt road here.
   The Jackson spots, to be broadcast next week, will be the first
paid American commercials on Soviet television.
   ``We're a very small outfit,'' said David Nussbaum of Global
American Television Inc., a big name for the little television
production company housed in the hills of western Massachusetts.
   Global American's founders, Pam Roberts and Ed Wierzbowski, seem
to have found an unlikely place for big-time wheeling and dealing
in their 1780 house with a half-finished addition and two young
children underfoot.
   But they had the inside edge: a long and trusting relationship
with the Soviet Union's primary TV network, Nussbaum said Friday.
The company's only full-time employee, Nussbaum is also helping
build the addition, watch the children, write scripts and negotiate
other commercial deals.
   ``We would rather be helping share ads for sweet drinks than
bombs,'' Nussbaum said.
   The company has worked with the government-controlled Soviet
network Gosteleradio since 1982 on such projects as ``Citizens
Summit,'' a talk show featuring Phil Donahue and his Soviet
counterpart, Vladimir Pozner, linked by satellite.
   Wierzbowski landed in Moscow on Friday and went immediately to
Soviet studios to begin editing Pepsi ads, including two featuring
Jackson. All the ads have already appeared on American television.
   Among other tasks, he must put the company logo and slogan
``Choice of a New Generation'' into Cyrillic script _ those
distinctive Russian letters _ and add a Soviet voice-over narration.
   The ads are to appear next Tuesday through Saturday on five
one-hour broadcasts of ``Pozner in America,'' in which the Soviet
commentator talks with Americans on such topics as U.S. family life
and attitudes toward Soviets.
   Roberts and Wierzbowski began their business with amateur
videotapes of protests at the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New
Hampshire and moved on to documentaries, including one on a uranium
plant strike in Tennessee.
   In 1982, they began traveling to the Soviet Union for
``Dialogue,'' a documentary on the visit of 40 Americans to
Siberia. That film gave them the idea for a live conversation
between Soviets and Americans that became ``Citizens Summit.''
   When Gosteleradio decided to air ``Pozner in America,'' it
turned to Roberts and Wierzbowski for help in choosing an
advertiser to defray the costs.
   ``They know us,'' Nussbaum said simply.
   He wouldn't reveal financial details of the deal, but the going
rate was reported to be $10,000 for a 30-second ad.
   ``The amounts of money we've gotten ... are not large amounts by
the standards of American markets,'' Nussbaum said. ``But the
Soviets will be receiving currency and that's what they want,
interest-generating currency with which to expand their programs.''
   Several U.S. companies that sell products in the Soviet Union
were approached, but Pepsi was the natural choice, since the
company pioneered in marketing there, Nussbaum said. The soft drink
has been sold there since 1974.
   A company spokesman said a Pepsi ad ran on Soviet television
during telecasts of the 1986 Goodwill Games, but that commercial
aired free of charge.

   A judge sentenced a rapist Friday to the longest
prison term ever imposed in Colorado _ 326 years _ and called him a
``savage parasite'' for his sexual assaults on six women in
Denver's Capitol Hill area.
   Quintin Wortham, 28, convicted Monday of 14 counts of sexual
assault, burglary and theft for the attacks in 1985 and 1986, drew
the maximum sentence from Judge Lynne Hufnagel.
   ``The possibility is remote that Quintin Wortham will be
anything but a savage parasite,'' she said.
   The sentence is the longest ever imposed in Colorado, said
District Attorney Norm Early.
   ``It sent a very definite, clear, easy-to-hear and appropriate
message,'' Early said.
   All but the two theft charges against Wortham brought
consecutive sentences.
   After reciting what Hufnagel described as Wortham's ``sordid
record,'' the judge said, ``The record is devoid of any positive
contributions to family or society.''
   Wortham's criminal record dates back to 1972 and included
numerous arrests for burglary and theft, and two earlier counts of
sexual assault. He was on parole at the time of the Capitol Hill
assaults.

<TEXT>
   A man who says he lit up absent-mindedly in an
airplane bathroom has become the first person accused of violating
the 3-week-old ban on smoking on domestic flights of two hours or
less, officials said Friday.
   Darryl Seigel, 38, of Seattle, faces fines of up to $4,000 if
the Federal Aviation Administration files charges, said FAA
spokeswoman Elly Brekke.
   Seigel admitted taking a few puffs on a cigarette during a
100-minute Seattle-to-Reno flight on USAir Thursday.
   ``He's not the first one to smoke on an airplane when they
weren't supposed to, but he's the first person to be accused of
breaking this new law,'' Brekke said.
   Brekke said statements were taken Friday from the plane's flight
and maintenance crews. The investigation should be completed within
60 days, she added.
   A flight attendant had spotted smoke coming from the lavatory
after Seigel left it about 20 minutes into the flight, Reno Cannon
International Airport spokesman Rich Peacock said.
   The flight attendant had explained the ban to passengers before
the plane took off. Seigel was detained for questioning by Reno
airport security for two hours.
   Seigel said he did not break the law intentionally. ``It was an
honest mistake,'' he said.
   Brekke said Seigel faces three possible charges: smoking when a
no smoking sign is on, which carries a $1,000 fine; smoking in the
lavatory, which also carries a $1,000 fine, and tampering with a
lavatory smoke detector, which carries a $2,000 fine.
   The smoking ban went into effect April 23.

<TEXT>
   George P. Shultz on Friday attacked
kiss-and-tell books by former Reagan administration officials as
violating presidential trust and defended President Reagan as being
``very much in charge'' of the country.
   The U.S. secretary of state also implied that such books affront
``common human decency'' as well.
   Without identifying the books he had in mind, Shultz called them
``a disservice'' and said he found the disclosures ``very
disappointing.''
   Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and later chief of staff
for Reagan, has the latest book out about his years in the White
House. One of his most sensational disclosures was that first lady
Nancy Reagan, and also the president, consulted an astrologer.
   Regan also portrayed the president as a passive chief executive
who did not question him about economic policy while Regan was
treasury secretary.
   In an earlier book, former White House spokesman Larry Speakes
revealed that he attributed to Reagan quotes which Speakes himself
fashioned.
   Shultz was in Brussels to brief North Atlantic Alliance
ministers on his talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   He told a news conference, ``Books that are written, especially
when an administration is in office, that essentially are gossipy
things, particularly about the first family, are very disappointing
and distressing to me.''
   He said a person who accepts a position close to the presidency,
with access to ``intimate discussion,'' should observe standards of
``common human decency'' and also preserve an atmosphere in which
the president can talk freely to his aides.
   He said that otherwise free discussion is inhibited.
   In response to a reporter's question, the secretary praised the
president and Mrs. Reagan, saying the administration had changed
the presidential agenda ``for the better'' and Mrs. Reagan had
worked hard to combat drugs.
   Shultz said, ``It's hard for me to see how anybody who takes
part (in discussions with the president) can come to any conclusion
other than _ on these basic issues that are presidential in nature
_ that the president is very much in charge. He has his views. He
expresses them. One of the reasons he is respected so much is that
he sticks to his positions.''

   Reagan administration officials rejected an
Air Force plan for a U.S.-Soviet mission that would involve
astronauts and cosmonauts using a Russian spacecraft to recover a
device from a Star Wars satellite, an industry magazine reported
Friday.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology, in an edition dated for
Monday, said Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, director of the Air
Force's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, proposed the
joint mission as a way of demonstrating U.S. willingness to share
the SDI (Star Wars) technology.
   The plan called for the launch in August or September of an SDI
satellite that would carry a breadbox-sized materials package
attached to its hull.
   The package would be recovered in a joint U.S.-Soviet mission
that would involve flying an astronaut and an American manned
manuevering unit with cosmonauts aboard a Russian spacecraft. The
manned manuevering unit, or MMU, is a backpack with compressed gas
jets that permits astronauts to fly around untethered in space.
   Aviation Week said the Soviet craft would be launched and then
linked up with the Soviet Mir space station. The astronaut or a
cosmonaut then would fly from Mir to the SDI satellite and recover
the package.
   Aviation Week did not name its source for the story.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Edwina Palmer of the SDI office refused to
confirm or deny the magazine story, saying she couldn't comment on
``internal deliberations.''
   Bill Sheehan, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said he also was unable to confirm or deny the
story.
   ``I have not been able to determine if that happened or not,''
Sheehan said.
   Aviation Week said NASA officials, including some astronauts at
the Johnson Space Center, were opposed to the idea. But the
magazine said engineers at Johnson and at a Martin Marietta plant
did study the feasibility of adapting the manned manuevering unit
so it would fit through the hatch of the Mir space station.
   Brian Welch, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center, declined
comment.

   A federal jury Friday began deciding
whether Carlos Lehder Rivas led efforts to flood the United States
with Colombian cocaine or was a simple businessman duped by
American smugglers.
   After seven months of trial, the panel began deliberating
shortly before noon on 11 charges against Lehder and one against
co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed. The jury recessed five hours later
and will return on Saturday.
   The jury, which will be sequestered, heard 22 weeks of testimony
from 115 government witnesses and saw mountains of documents and
carts of packaged cocaine. The defense called no witnesses, relying
instead on closing arguments.
   Lehder, reputed to be one of the leaders of Colombia's violent
Medellin cartel, has been called the most important foreign drug
smuggler to face trial in the United States, a man who pioneered
the idea of mass shipments of cocaine.
   Wrapping up his prosecution, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle told
the jury: ``You either convict him of everything in this case of
convict him of nothing in the case.''
   In his closing statement, chief defense attorney Edward R.
Shohat argued that Lehder was simply a businessman who wanted to
develop the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as a tourist resort but
was victimized by a conspiring group of Americans who told the jury
``a litany of lies.''
   Shohat said that group's leader was Ed Ward, a convicted drug
smuggler who served served six years of a 20-year sentence and is
now in living under a new identity in the federal witness
protection program.
   He charged that Ward, a former Jacksonville area salesman and
insurance agent, was ``given the break of a lifetime.'' By agreeing
to cooperate against Lehder, Ward reduced a possible 215-year plus
life sentence and a $5.9 million fine to less than six years in
prison, Shohat said.
   If convicted, Lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison,
$250,000 in fines and forfeiture of his assets in the Bahamas.
   Shohat also hammered away at what he said were inconsistencies
in the testimony of other witnesses, many of them smugglers who
also got reduced sentences or immunity for their testimony.
   ``These people planned to dump on Mr. Lehder. These people knew
how to get an American Express card to freedom,'' he said.
   Lehder, 38, was specifically charged with one count of
conspiracy to import cocaine, two counts of importation of cocaine
and seven counts of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute. Upon conviction, each count carries a penalty of up to
15 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
   He also was accused of engaging in a continuing criminal
enterprise, a charge that carries a sentence of 10 years to life.
   Reed faced only one charge of conspiracy, and a maximum penalty
of 15 years in prison and a $25,000 fine.
   The indictment said Lehder and Reed conspired to smuggle some
3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via
Norman's Cay from 1978 to 1980. Actual testimony, however, alleged
that nearly 20 tons was smuggled by Lehder's organization, earning
him about $20 million.
   Lehder, the son of a German father and Colombian mother, grew up
on the streets of New York. He was sentenced to federal prison in
1974 on a charge of auto theft and marijuana possession.
   He was deported to Colombia in 1975.
   Lehder was indicted in 1981 but remained at large until Feb. 4,
1987, when he was arrested by Colombian officials at a ranch near
Medellin, Colombia, following a brief gunfight. He was immediately
put on a plane and brought to the United States.
   Reed, known as ``Smilin' Jack,'' was arrested two days later in
a jungle hut on the east coast of Panama.
   Jury selection began in October and testimony started on Nov.
17, 1987, six weeks later.
   The indictment says Lehder is one of the leaders of the Medellin
cartel, which is reportedly responsible for the importation of 80
percent of the cocaine into the United States, valued at $8 billion
a year.

   A prominent scholar said Friday the growth of
the centralized national state in the 20th century threatens the
United States with the same death suffered by ancient empires of
the past.
   Robert Nisbet, retired humanities professor at Columbia
University and resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, praised villages,
families, churches, lodges and other forms of local communities as
the best defense against excessive centralization of power.
   ``It is in these intermediate groups and associations that the
truest forms of community will be found,'' Nisbet said in a speech
text distributed to reporters in advance. ``They must be preserved,
strengthened, honored.''
   Nisbet, a widely published historian and sociologist, delivered
the 17th annual Jefferson Lecture, the highest honor conferred by
the federal government for outstanding achievement in the
humanities.
   Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, an
independent federal agency that underwrites research, scholarship
and education in the humanities, the lecturer receives a stipend of
$10,000.
   ``The danger of large, centralized bureaucracies is simply what
we already see, what is already obvious: the suffocation or
strangling of genuine thought, of genuine leadership, of genuine
consensus,'' Nisbet said.
   The lecturer saw hope in Americans' dislike for the ``massive,
circuitous, maze-like federal bureaucracy,'' and what he called a
growing preference for ``localism,'' with reliance on the family,
cities and states, organized neighborhoods and volunteer
associations.
   If those true forms of community are not nourished, he said,
``if we continue to worship the national state and the national
community, we risk exposure to the fatal diseases of empires in
history: apoplexy at the center and anemia at the extremities.''

<HEAD>Iraqi Planes Hit Iranian Cargo Ship With Missiles; 11 Injured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi aircraft fired Exocet missiles at
an Iranian cargo ship in the Persian Gulf and later damaged a
tugboat towing the stricken vessel, a London-based maritime agency
said Friday.
   The attack on the cargo ship injured 11 crewmen, one seriously,
said Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit.
   Iraq reported another attack by its warplanes on a ``large naval
target'' off the Iranian coast on Thursday afternoon, its ninth
such claim in the past two weeks. The latest claim appeared to
coincide with the attack on the tug, the Sea Sapphire.
   However, a gulf-based shipping source said he had received
information that the Iranian cargo vessel, the Iran Nahad,
``exploded'' during an attack about 1:20 a.m. Thursday and may have
been carrying arms.
   The source, who has shipping connections in the area but spoke
on condition he not be identified, also quoted his informant as
saying the tugboat was searching for survivors of the blast, but
was not itself attacked.
   There was no way immediately to reconcile the conflicting
reports. Iran does not divulge details of Iraqi raids on its
coastal waters.
   Lloyd's said that in the first attack at 1 a.m. Iraqi Exocet
missiles hit the 16,580-ton Iran Nahad, setting a fire that gutted
the crew quarters.
   Thirteen hours later, as the ship was being towed to Lavan
island, an oil terminal along Iran's central Gulf coast, Lloyd's
said, it was attacked for a second time.
   It did not indicate whether the Iran Nahad was hit again, but
said the Liberian-owned and Panamanian-flagged Sea Sapphire, which
was towing the vessel, ``sustained damage to the wheelhouse,'' and
would go to a United Arab Emirates shipyard for repair.
   Iraq, locked in a 7{-year-old war with Iran, attacks Iranian
tankers. Iran retaliates with attacks on neutral shipping. Its last
such attack was on a Saudi Arabian tanker on April 24.
   A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Forrestal
sailed through the Suez Canal, en route to the Arabian Sea, where
it will operate in support of the U.S. escort operations in the
gulf.
   The 60,000-ton Forrestal becomes the fifth U.S. aircraft carrier
to serve in the Arabian Sea since the United States expanded its
naval presence in the gulf in July last year to furnish escort for
11 Kuwaiti oil tankers re-registered under the American flag.
   Three of those tankers are currently en route down the gulf in
the 31st convoy this year and the 53rd since the operation began.
   The Forrestal's Atlantic coast-based battle group, including
three destroyers, two frigates and two supply vessels, replaces a
Pacific coast group headed by the nuclear-powered carrier
Enterprise.

   A city council member who touched off a
dispute by proclaiming himself council president after the death of
Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri had no right to do so, the city's legal
adviser said Friday.
   Councilman Ben Woods, who on Thursday had declared that ``I can
do what I want'' because he was the rightful acting council
president, said Friday that he would abide by the ruling of city
Solicitor Dan Pellegrini saying that it wasn't so.
   ``Some members of city council are obviously jockeying for
position,'' Pellegrini said. ``They believe they can get some
advantage out of it.''
   Caliguiri, a popular politician who had been mayor since 1977,
died May 6 at age 56 of a rare, incurable illness. The city council
president, Sophie Masloff, was sworn in as the mayor's successor,
and Woods argued that as council president pro tem he should
automatically take Mrs. Masloff's job.
   Pellegrini said Friday that Mrs. Masloff would retain the
council president title but will not exercise those powers, which
include appointing committee heads and hiring council employees.
   The city council will decide next week who will exercise those
powers instead, Pellegrini said. Woods said he expected the eight
members of council, not including Mrs. Masloff, would vote Monday
to hand the reins to him.
   ``I'll live with it (Pellegrini's ruling),'' Woods said Friday.
``I don't agree with it. ... He's the city solicitor. I'm not going
to challenge it in court.''
   Woods began exercising the powers of president the day Caliguiri
died. Among other things, he rescinded the $100 fine Finance
Committee Chairman Mark Pollock had levied against Councilman Jim
Ferlo and the $60 fine against Councilman Jack Wagner. Pollock
accused his two political adversaries of disrupting a committee
meeting.
   ``Most concerned citizens were thinking of the mayor and his
family,'' Pollock said. ``Ben was thinking about rescinding fines
and taking power, which tells a great deal.''
   Another critic on the city council, Michelle Madoff, accused
Woods of ``causing a circus.''
   ``Here we are, not even a few days after the burial, and Ben's
coming in and dividing us, saying, `I'm in charge. I'm running this
place.' He hasn't even waited for a legal opinion,'' she said
Thursday.
   The city charter is vague on the succession issue. Woods cited
precedent for his position. Pellegrini cited precedent and prior
solicitors' opinions for his legal opinion.
   Both council president and president pro tem are elected by the
city council. ``Pro tem'' is short for the Latin phrase pro
tempore, which means temporary or temporarily.

   A 7-year-old boy who has recovered from
serious automobile accident injuries missed out on a White House
meeting with President Reagan on Friday because of a mix up in time.
   But presidential aides will arrange for a make-up visit soon for
young Chris Dunning and his family of Alexandria, Va., Deputy Press
Secretary B.J. Cooper said.
   Reagan showed up 12 minutes late for a ``Safe Kids'' program in
the Rose Garden and explained it was because ``we were waiting for
one very special person, who apparently is not going to be able to
get here.''
   Safe Kids is an organization backed by the National Safety
Council and Children's Hospital here to conduct a national campaign
to fight preventable injuries to children.
   The Dunning boy was hit by a car while playing near his home in
August 1985.
   ``Suffering serious neck and leg injuries, Christopher could
easily have been paralyzed had any of the people who treated him
made the slightest mistake,'' Reagan told the group. ``But
fortunately, the paramedics had completed a pediatric trauma
course. And today, he is fully healed.''
   About the time the president was saying these words, Chris's
father, James Dunning, was telephoning Children's Hospital to
confirm the time that the family was supposed to be there for the
trip to the White House.
   He was told that the event already was going on.
   Cooper said the program, originally planned for 1:45 p.m., had
been changed to 11:45 a.m. and the Dunnings hadn't been told,
although other families who were to be present were notified.
   Kim Haddow, a spokeswoman for Safe Kids, confirmed that ``that
is what happened.''
   So, instead of going to the White House, young Chris went off to
the beach with friends, his father said.
   ``I don't think he actually realized what a big deal it was,''
said Haddow.
   He said the White House already had called to say that the
family would be getting an invitation to call on the president soon.

   A convoy of logging trucks so long that
it took at least a half-hour to pass a given point rolled through
western Montana on Friday to protest U.S. Forest Service
regulations lumberjacks say are strangling the industry.
   The trucks began in Eureka, Mont., and proceeded along a
twisting, 200-mile stretch of road through this heavily timbered
area. Motorists pulled to the side of the road and waved in support
as the big trucks passed.
   By the time the trucks rolled through Arlee, the convoy
stretched for 15 miles. Seventy-three lumber trucks, interspersed
with a 100 to 150 support vehicles, were counted. More trucks
joined the convoy along the route.
   Most of the trucks carried slogans spray-painted on their logs,
including ``Save our American timber industry,'' ``Jobs not
wilderness'' and ``Donated to save a mill, not a grizzly.''
   In Kalispell, hundreds came to the curb and waved as the convoy
stopped traffic in the town of 10,000.
   It took the convoy 30 to 45 minutes to pass a given point on the
highway, roadside observers said.
   One logger, Ken Howard of Whitefish, said he hoped
environmentalists will ``back off a little bit after today's event
and let us keep working. They're killing us every day.''
   The protest was aimed at the appeals process that must be
followed in every sale of timber from land in the national forests.
Loggers say environmentalists now routinely file appeals, blocking
timber sales for months or years.
   The trucks traveled at 40 to 45 mph. Organizers said the intent
of the convoy was not to delay traffic needlessly, but the Montana
Highway Patrol warned motorists that the convoy would be impossible
to pass.

World War II</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An embattled Cabinet minister who said Japan was
not at fault for World War II resigned Friday after complaints at
home and abroad hurt Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
administration.
   Seisuke Okuno, chief of the National Land Agency, handed in his
resignation late Friday afternoon, said officials in the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Former Construction Minister Hideo Utsumi, 66, was named his
successor. Utsumi told reporters Japan should try to promote good
relations with China, Kyodo News Service reported.
   The affair comes four months before a scheduled visit by
Takeshita to China late this summer.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda acknowledged
Thursday that Okuno's statements ``give very serious damage to our
heart-to-heart relations between the two peoples.''
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, who tried to soothe China's
irritation during a visit to Beijing last week, said only, ``We
would like to try harder to promote friendly ties with neighboring
countries.''
   The 75-year-old Okuno, who headed the justice and education
ministries under previous administrations, was widely regarded as
the No. 3 man in the government after Takeshita and Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
   At a news conference, Okuno said he stepped down ``not because I
erred,'' but because his remarks had disrupted parliamentary
business.
   The announcement came three weeks after Okuno claimed Japan was
not an aggressor in World War II and had ``fought to protect itself
at a time when the white race had turned Asia into a colony.''
   China, South Korea and North Korea condemned the statements. In
Japan, opposition political parties united in calling for his
resignation. The largest opposition groups, the Japan Socialist
Party and the Komeito (Clean Government Party), were prepared to
submit a no-confidence resolution in Parliament, a Komeito official
said.
   News reports Friday said Takeshita, who avoided disputing
Okuno's remarks or taking action against him, wanted him to step
down voluntarily. Kyodo reported that he put the request to Okuno
in a meeting Friday morning.
   Opposition leaders hailed Friday's outcome as appropriate.
   ``Okuno's remarks violated the spirit of the ... Sino-Japanese
Peace and Friendship Treaty, so his resignation is proper,'' said
Yuichi Ichikawa, parliamentary policy head of the Komeito. ``It was
long overdue.''
   Okuno was the third politician in Takeshita's six-month-old
government to resign amid controversy.
   In February, Koichi Hamada, chairman of the lower house Budget
Committee, resigned after a five-day parliamentary stalemate
following an outburst in which he called an opposition legislator a
``murderer.''
   In November, days after Takeshita became prime minister, lower
house Justice Committee Chairman Hideyuki Aizawa stepped down after
he was charged with evading taxes. Both were ranking officials in
Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party.
   China and Japan waged an eight-year war beginning in 1937 that
killed an estimated 571,000 Japanese and 1.3 million Chinese
soldiers and an untold number of civilians.
   The two countries signed a treaty in 1972 that says in part,
``The Japanese side is keenly aware of Japan's responsibility for
causing enormous damages in the past to the Chinese people through
war and deeply reproaches itself.''
   It was the hawkish Okuno's third major brush with controversy in
his political career. As Kakuei Tanaka's education minister, he
faced a no-confidence motion in the early 1970s after he called the
Japan Teachers Union a ``dissident group.''
   As justice minister a decade later under Prime Minister Zenko
Suzuki, he was criticized for urging revision of the constitution,
which renounces the use of war.

<HEAD>Army Chief Of Staff Granted Amnesty on Human Rights Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court gave Gen. Jose
D. Caridi, the army chief of staff, amnesty Friday for any human
rights violations he may have committed while serving under the
former military government.
   The case stemmed from charges of kidnapping, torture and murder
against Caridi and 11 other officers while he was an army colonel
at the Military Institute under former Gen. Santiago Omar Rivero.
Details of the charges were not available.
   Amnesty also was extended by the court action to the other
officers, who include three former generals.
   Under the ``due obedience'' law passed in June 1987, only top
commanders _ in this case Rivero _ can be prosecuted for ordering
violations of human rights during the ``dirty war'' against
leftists in 1976-83.
   The law was proposed by President Raul Alfonsin, whose civilian
government replaced the military regime in December 1983.
   It has resulted in amnesty for about 300 lower-ranking officers
accused of abuses. Court sources say only 20-30 officers, most of
them generals, face prosecution, court sources say.
   At least 9,000 people vanished during the ``dirty war'' and are
presumed dead, according to a government study ordered by Alfonsin
shortly after he took office. Rights groups say the number is
nearer 30,000.
   Five former junta members, including two presidents, were
convicted in 1985 and are serving prison terms ranging from four
years to life.
   Caridi, 56, became chief of staff in April 1987, a few days
after an unsuccessful military revolt at three Army camps. He
replaced Gen. Hector Rios Erenu.

   Slavery was abolished 100 years
ago in Brazil and the country celebrated emancipation Friday with
speeches, concerts, protests and a national holiday.
   President Jose Sarney ordered the expropriation of 250 acres in
northeastern Brazil for the construction of a monument to the 17th
century rebel slave leader Zumbi.
   The Brazilian Symphony Orchestra in Rio put on a free open-air
concert in honor of black contributions to Brazilian culture.
   In cities across the country, all-black groups dressed in white
danced traditional African dances and put on exhibitions of
capoeira, a martial art created by black slaves centuries ago.
   Major Brazilian newspapers carried ads paid for by dozens of
corporations _ including foreign multinationals such as General
Motors and Olivetti _ in honor of emancipation.
   Pele, Brazil's great black soccer star, said in an interview
with the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil, ``I'm black and proud of
it. Color never was a problem for me.''
   But he added that blacks should ``try to attain an equality that
doesn't exist.''
   On Thursday night about 300 prominent black actors, musicians
and dancers shouting ``slavery never again'' gathered in downtown
Rio for a mass in celebration of the centennial.
   In Brasilia, the nation's capital, the Congress held a special
session honoring Brazilian blacks. Legislators praised South
African black rights leader Nelson Mandela and condemned that
country's apartheid regime.
   In the northeastern city of Salvador, considered the center of
black culture in Brazil, about 5,000 protesters held a ``march
against racism'' Thursday night and burned a picture of Princess
Isabel, who freed the slaves on May 13, 1888.
   Blacks and mulattoes make up about 80 percent of Brazil's 143
million people. However, they lag far behind whites in education
and earning power and black rights groups say the government
encourages inequality by promoting a false image of the country as
a ``racial democracy.''

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday ordered the former
administrator of Drake Memorial Hospital to spend 30 days in jail
for falsifying the personnel file of Donald Harvey, the former
nurse's aide who has admitted killing 48 people.
   Former Administrator Jan Taylor was sentenced after he pleaded
no contest to falsifying a public document, a misdemeanor offense.
Taylor was indicted last year on four felony charges of tampering
with evidence for adding information to Harvey's file, but he
pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor count as part of a bargain
with prosecutors.
   Families of Harvey's victims were unhappy that Taylor, 50, was
able to avoid a trial that could have developed information for use
in their civil suits stemming from the killings.
   Harvey, 35, is serving three consecutive life terms in the state
prison at Lucasville after pleading guilty to killing 21 patients
when he worked as a nurse's aide at Drake, a hospital for long-term
care, from 1983 to 1987.
   Harvey used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of his victims,
often putting it in the hospital food he served them, authorities
said.
   Harvey also is serving a simultaneous life sentence for
admitting killing nine people at Marymount Hospital in London, Ky.,
while he worked there in 1970-71. The FBI is looking into Harvey's
claims that he also killed 18 people while working at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati before he was hired at
Drake.
   Taylor was accused of putting in the personnel file that
Harvey's references had been checked out with previous employers.
Defense attorney R. Scott Croswell said the information was added
because Taylor believed it was his duty to update the file and make
it complete.
   Taylor, who did not hire Harvey, has said that after the
investigation of Harvey had begun, he noticed the information about
references was lacking and had another Drake employee check the
references and add them to the file.
   Precisely what the hospital had done to check Harvey before he
was hired is a matter of dispute in civil suits by victims'
relatives.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Robert Gorman gave Taylor the
maximum sentence of 180 days in jail, then suspended all but 30
days. He declined to fine Taylor, who could have received up to a
$1,000 fine.
   Gorman said he was giving Taylor a jail sentence because he was
a public figure held to a higher standard than private citizens in
such matters.
   ``This sentence is offered as a deterrent more than a
punishment, and it's a message to others who hold similar office,''
Gorman said.
   Taylor declined to talk to reporters as he left the courtroom.
Gorman said he can remain free for 30 days while he decides whether
to appeal the sentence.
   Relatives of some of Harvey's victims, who sat in the courtroom
Friday, said Taylor and other Drake officials should have stood
trial for their handling of the Harvey case.
   ``I don't really quarrel with the judge as much as I quarrel
with the prosecutor's office,'' said Michael Pike, whose father,
Joseph, 68, was killed by an injection of cleaning fluid last year.
   ``It's a slap in the face to everyone murdered out there,'' Pike
said. ``It's a slap in the face to the families.''
   The victims' families had fought the prosecutor's office to try
to get information obtained in the criminal investigation of
Harvey. The no-contest plea that resulted in the sentencing Friday
cannot be used against Taylor in the civil suits.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Friday that a Securities
and Exchange Commission attorney was sexually harassed by her
bosses and got a bad evaluation and a transfer for complaining
about the hostile work environment.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt upheld Catherine A.
Broderick's complaints that she was harassed by managers of the
agency's Washington regional office and denied promotions when she
complained about the unit's ``sexually hostile'' environment.
   Pratt held that the SEC had violated the section of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 that forbids sex discrimination and he scheduled
a May 26 hearing to determine what sanctions to impose on the
agency.
   ``Plaintiff, without any doubt was forced to work in an
environment in which the WRO (Washington regional office) managers
by their conduct harassed her and other WRO female employees, by
bestowing preferential treatment upon those who submitted to their
sexual advances,'' Pratt said.
   ``The record is clear that plaintiff and other women working at
the WRO found the sexual conduct and its accompanying
manifestations which WRO managers engaged in over a protracted
period of time to be offensive,'' Pratt said.
   Pratt ruled that Ms. Broderick, 35, received a negative
evaluation and was transferred to another division after
complaining that male supervisors had sexual relationships with
women employees. This socializing included on-the-job drinking and
long lunch hours.
   The judge also found that former SEC Commissioner John Shad, now
ambassador to the Netherlands, and the agency's executive director,
George Kundahl, were aware of Ms. Broderick's complaints in early
1984, when she filed a memo outlining her allegations.
   The agency, which conducted its own internal investigation,
ruled against Ms. Broderick in 1986.
   S. Beville May, Ms. Broderick's attorney, called the ruling ``an
absolute, unparalleled victory.''
   Ms. May said the ruling means that Broderick, who works in the
corporation finances section, will be entitled to back pay and
promotions denied as a result of sex discrimination.
   SEC spokesman Mary McCue said the agency did not have any
comment on Pratt's ruling.
   Pratt found that within a week of joining the SEC staff in 1979,
Ms. Broderick spurned repeated offers of a ride home from staff
counsel John Hunter.
   At a farewell party for a co-worker in 1982, Ms. Broderick was
kissed by the regional administrator, Paul F. Leonard, after he
came up to her and untied her sweater.
   The judge also accepted Broderick's testimony that Leonard and
trial counsel Jack Kiefner made suggestive remarks about her dress
and figure.
   But ``it was the occurrence of numerous other incidents of which
plaintiff early on became aware which, for her, created a sexually
hostile or offensive working environment,'' Pratt ruled.
   ``This in turn poisoned the possibility of plaintiff's having
the proper professional respect for her superiors and, without any
question, affected her motivation and her performance of her job
responsibilities,'' Pratt ruled.
   The Washington regional office closed and many of the SEC
officials named in Ms. Broderick's complaint were transferred to
the newly created Philadelphia regional office.
   Pratt discounted the testimony of Leonard, now retired, and
Cliff Kennedy, the agency's Philadelphia regional administrator and
Hunter ``as deserving little credence.''
   The judge found that the testimony of Herbert F. Brooks Jr., now
assistant regional administrator in Philadelphia, ``was in material
respects false and incredible.''
   The judge ruled ``there is compelling evidence that Brooks had a
sexual relationship'' with a secretary who received two promotions
and a $300 cash award and a perfect evaluation.
   Pratt also found that a woman staff attorney received several
promotions during a time she socialized on the job with Kennedy.
   Pratt also found that Hunter had an affair with a secretary who
received three promotions, a commendation and two cash awards.
   Despite Hunter's admissions that he contributed to the
secretary's evaluations, Pratt found he ``was never disciplined for
this conduct, but instead received 10 salary increases between
October 1983 and January 1987.''

   Jewelers say it's plain old tarnish,
but at least 18 Roman Catholics say it's a miracle: They report
that their rosaries have changed from silver to gold or copper.
   The believers dismiss the scientific explanation of the
phenomenon, instead crediting the Virgin Mary for the yellowish
color of their formerly silver rosaries.
   ``It was like Mary came to me,'' said Lila Somers of Novato,
clutching her rosary in a church's Bible study room where she went
this week to hear other tales of rosary miracles.
   ``The rosary was in my hand and it was glowing,'' she said.
   Somers and 17 others have reported the color change since a
retreat in Burlingame last month that focused on Mary. About 50
members of the Mother of God Queen of Peace Prayer Community of the
Carmelite Monastery in Marinwood, encompassing two prayer groups,
attended.
   They say the experience has changed their lives and encouraged
them to pursue their faith in a deeper way.
   ``Chills went through my whole body,'' said Mary Senour of
Petaluma, who said she saw her rosary turn from silver to gold as
she drove home from the retreat 15 miles south of San Francisco.
``I just felt humbled, like God was really blessing us.''
   Jewelers say the erosion or tarnishing of the silveer coating is
influenced by body moisture and environmental factors such as
humidity and climate.
   ``The one that we inspected is made out of brass and white base
metal, and under certain conditions base metals will oxidize and
corrode,'' said Evan Hacker, a Mill Valley jeweler who examined one
of the rosaries. ``It's an oxidation process better known as
tarnishing.''
   Miraculous changes in the prayer beads have been reported in
other parts of the world.
   In Portsmouth, R.I., at least 50 parishioners reported their
rosaries had changed from silver to gold after a man returned last
June from a pilgrimage to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia. Children in that
community claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary many times.
   Mary Ann Serrano, a San Rafael evangelist, has visited
Medjugorje and said there are numerous other associated phenomena,
including a crackling fireball and the sun spinning across the sky.
   ``Maybe we're a little too enthusiastic,'' she said of the local
incident. ``But it's real. It's the realest of the real.''
   The Rev. John McGregor, a part-time chaplain for the Carmelite
sisters, also dismisses the scientific explanation.
   ``I don't really think it's a chemical reaction from their
sweaty hands ...,'' he said. ``I think the phenomenon is much like
Moses and the burning bush. It calls people's attention to prayer.''

   Scattered rain and thunderstorms hit the East from the Florida
Keys to New York State on Friday, while a cold front brought strong
gusts to the West.
   Rain also fell over the Pacific Northwest. Sunny skies prevailed
over much of the rest of the nation.
   Thunderstorms developed across the Florida Keys and over western
Pennsylvania in the morning and extended into Ohio and New York
State. Youngstown, Ohio recorded one-third of an inch of rain in
the six hours ended 2 p.m. EDT.
   Showers also stretched from the South Carolina coast across
Georgia and northern Florida.
   A cold front from central Montana to southern Nevada whipped
strong winds over several states and sent temperatures falling
sharply in its wake.
   Livingston, Mont. recorded gusts to 64 mph, and blowing dust
reduced visibility to 3 miles. Winds gusted to 55 mph in Milford,
Utah.
   Wind advisories were posted for parts of the southern California
desert and for southeast Idaho.
   Behind the cold front, temperatures were in the 50s and 60s in
Idaho, well below Thursday's readings in the 80s and low 90s.
   At 3 p.m., temperatures around the nation ranged from 36 degrees
at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. to 103 at Tucson, Ariz. The nation's
morning low morning was 22 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Rain and thundershowers were forecast Saturday over the northern
Plains and from eastern South Carolina into Florida. Scattered
showers were predicted for northern Maine and northern Washington
State.
   Highs were predicted in the 50s and 60s from New England across
the Great Lakes; in the 60s from the northern Rockies to the
northern Pacific Coast; in the 90s from western Kansas to western
Texas, and in the 90s to about 105 over inland southern California
and the desert Southwest. Highs in the rest of the nation were
forecast in the 70s and 80s.

   The leaders of a new political group formed to
challenge the Communist Party unveiled their platform Friday and
said they planned to try to register with authorities but expected
to be rebuffed.
   At a crowded eighth-floor apartment in northwest Moscow,
organizers of the Democratic Union gathered to discuss their plans
for political action. At least a dozen uniformed policemen milled
around the building entrance but made no attempt to stop those
entering or leaving.
   The declaration of goals and principles followed a week of
meetings in which the organizers said more than 150 Soviets from 27
cities took part in deciding political stands for the party formed
on May 7.
   Yuri Denisov, one of the party's 15 Central Coordinating Council
members, said the Democratic Union would try to comply with laws
requiring groups to register their activity.
   ``We will soon make an attempt to register our party,'' he told
journalists. ``But of course we expect problems with that and we do
not expect to succeed.''
   Another of the coordinating council members, Alexander Lukashev,
outlined broad party policies, summing up the new group's goal as
presenting an ``opposition'' to the current Communist Party
monopoly on power and political thought.
   The group opposes the ``Soviet occupation'' of the Baltic states
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and Soviet actions in Eastern
Europe that have helped keep Communist government in power there,
he said.
   The party has called for independent trade unions, and on Friday
issued a statement denouncing Polish officials' actions to halt
industrial strikes in the Soviet-allied country.
   ``The Democratic Union comes out in opposition to
totalitarianism of political parties,'' the group's statement of
principles declares as its first objective.
   The party program sets out methods for calling elections and
filling leadership positions, and says funds raised by the group
will be used for ``informational activity, agitation, printing
costs and organizational needs.''
   Party activists complained that their first week was marred by
``repressive'' and ``unconstitutional'' actions of the KGB, local
police forces and the state-run press. The official Tass news
agency denounced the party on Wednesday, accusing the activists of
``slanderous, anti-social activity.''
   Dozens of participants were detained by police after the
organizational meetings last weekend, with sentences of five to
seven days in jail handed down summarily to four of them, including
dissident magazine editor Sergei Grigoryants.
   Grigoryants, who edits the unofficial magazine ``Glasnost,''
remained jailed Friday night and no one had been permitted to see
him, the activists said.
   Denisov said the party planned a political conference in the
fall, but that details of that gathering had not been worked out
yet.

<HEAD>Cyanide Tampering Jury Questioned; Attorney To Ask for Mistrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The attorney for a woman convicted in the
nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial said Friday that he
will ask for a mistrial in the case.
   Federal public defender Thomas Hillier gave notice of his intent
to ask for a mistrial as jurors in the Stella Nickell case were
ordered back to court to answer questions about whether they were
improperly influenced in reaching a verdict. The formal motion for
a mistrial is expected to be filed next week.
   Hillier did not elaborate on his reasons for seeking a mistrial,
except to say that there was no way to know how the jury's
deliberations were affected by a juror who was privy to information
that was not presented to jurors during the trial.
   Suspicion over juror impartiality had increased since the
verdict Monday.
   Questions were raised when juror Laurel Holliday said an
anonymous phone caller had told her that Mrs. Nickell had failed a
lie-detector test, and later when it was revealed that Ms. Holliday
had filed a lawsuit of her own last year alleging that a product
had been contaminated.
   Under questioning by U.S. District Judge William Dwyer, however,
Ms. Holliday denied she had been improperly influenced in any way
in reaching her verdict.
   The jury took five days to convict Mrs. Nickell, 44, of Auburn,
of contaminating over-the-counter medicine capsules with cyanide.
They included two counts of spiking the capsules that killed her
husband, Bruce Nickell, 52, and a stranger, Susan Katherine Snow,
40, of Auburn, in June 1986.
   She faces possible life imprisonment at a June 17 sentencing.
Prosecutors said she killed her husband to collect $176,000 in life
insurance benefits.
   Her trial was the first under federal anti-tampering statutes
enacted after seven people died in Chicago in 1982 from
cyanide-laced Tylenol. No one was ever charged in that case.
   Ms. Holliday had said she received the anonymous phone call May
6, when jurors were still deadlocked 11-1 in favor of convicting
Mrs. Nickell. Ms. Holliday was the lone holdout.
   Ms. Holliday told Dwyer on Friday, however, that she had
dismissed the information about the lie-detector test from her mind
during deliberation and judged the case on the facts.
   She also said she did not mention her own lawsuit when she was
questioned during jury selection because she did not think it was
relevant.
   After listening to Ms. Holliday's testimony Friday, Hillier said
it raised ``very serious and troubling questions on her ability to
sit on this jury.''
   The other 11 jurors were also questioned. All of them said they
had been unaware during the deliberations of the phone call to Ms.
Holliday or the lie-detector test, and had no idea who could have
placed the call.
   Potential jurors had been asked whether they had ever been party
to a product-tampering case. But Ms. Holliday said she considered
her case one involving a manufacturing error.
   Ms. Holliday had sued Pepperidge Farm Inc. in 1987 after she
allegedly bit into a cracker in 1986 that contained an
aspirin-substitute pill. The matter was settled out of court for
$500, less than two months prior to Ms. Holliday's selection for
Mrs. Nickell's jury.
   ``I still don't see how that relates to Stella Nickell and how I
would determine guilt or innocence,'' Ms. Holliday said.

<HEAD>Witnesses: Police Fire On Moslem Protesters; One Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on the island of Zanzibar
opened fire on rock-throwing Moslems demonstrating Friday against
criticism of polygamy under Islamic law and one person was killed,
witnesses said.
   The trouble started as the marchers approached State House, the
official residence of the president of this semiautonomous Indian
Ocean Island, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Moslems were demonstrating against Sofia Kawawa, head of
Tanzania's national women's organization, who this week criticized
a section of Islamic law which allows a man to have four wives.
   The protesters shouted ``God is great'' and cursed Mrs. Kawawa
as the marched.
   ``There was a commotion between police and the people when the
procession tried to reach State House,'' said one witness reached
by telephone. ``The marchers were stopped and told not to go any
farther.
   ``When they continued, police opened fire. One fellow has died
and several are injured,'' the witness said.
   About 250 police who ringed the presidential residence tried to
stop the procession and some in the crowd began throwing stones,
witnesses said.
   There was no estimate of the number of protesters.
   Another witness said the man who was killed was shot in the
chest and at least three other people were wounded. The witness
said he also saw police clubbing protesters.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the leader of the march,
Sheik Ali Yani, was arrested Friday evening.
   The twin islands of Zanzibar and Pemba together with the
mainland form the Republic of Tanzania.
   The protest march began shortly after the Moslems completed
their noon prayers. Nearly 12 hours after the rioting, the official
government media still had not reported the trouble.
   During a three-day seminar on women and development sponsored by
the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Revolutionary Party), Mrs. Kawawa
urged Tanzania to abandon all forms of discrimination against
women. She criticized, in particular, Islamic views on polygamy and
inheritance.
   Party chairman Julius Nyerere and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi
spoke in general against the denial of women's rights.
   Nyerere, the most powerful political figure in Tanzania,
deplored people who wrongly use religion to exercise and justify
injustice against women and said it would not be accepted.
   During Friday's prayers, Yani made a scathing attack against the
ruling party. He told his followers that the party had no power to
change the Koran and then led followers on a march toward State
House.

   Republican George Bush labeled Michael
Dukakis naive on defense Friday, equating him with 1972 nominee
George McGovern and saying ``even Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale''
supported military systems Dukakis opposes.
   ``The Dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful thinking. And
it is bad thinking,'' the vice president told a crowd of defense
plant workers here. ``The Soviets...respect only strength. To think
that they would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventional
arsenals in the face of unilateral American abandonment of major
weapons programs is the height of folly.''
   Bush portrayed Dukakis, his likely Democratic opponent in the
fall election, as more extreme than former President Carter and
1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale.
   ``The governor's views are naive at best and if implemented
would be dangerous to the defense of this country,'' Bush said.
``It is the thinking of George McGovern, not Harry Truman. Even
Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale supported systems that Governor
Dukakis opposes.''
   At a rally later in Escondido, Calif., Bush said the 1988 choice
will be crystal clear.
   ``It will be like the McGovern race in 1972,'' he told a
Republican rally. ``It's that clear.''
   The Hughes Aircraft plant, where air traffic control systems and
military radars are made, was the second defense plant in as many
days for the GOP nominee-to-be. He emphasized his defense policies
anew at a San Diego air show on Friday before flying to Portland,
Ore., in advance of the Tuesday primary there.
   Standing in the brilliant sunshine before several thousand
Hughes employees, Bush tossed out almost a third of his prepared
speech to wind up with a ferverent patriotic appeal.
   ``If I am elected your president...I will never ever apologize
for the United States of America. I will help keep her strong,''
Bush declared. ``I will protect our vital freedoms. I will help
those around the world who are struggling for freedom and democracy.
   ``Never take for granted the blessings that we have in this, the
greatest country on the face of the earth.''
   As in previous speeches, Bush criticized the Democrats for
opposition to various Reagan defense programs, this time aiming the
accusation directly at the Massachusetts governor.
   ``Gov. Dukakis _ and Jesse Jackson as well _ opposes virtually
every step we are taking to keep our defenses at the technological
edge,'' Bush said, adding Dukakis' name to a charge he initiated
Thursday. ``Dukakis opposes the MX. He opposes the Midgetman. He
opposes testing of nuclear weapons. He opposes flight-testing of
ballistic missiles. He opposes testing of anti-satellite weapons.
He opposes the building of a strategic defense.''
   Dukakis aides were quick to respond.
   ``What Bush is trying to do is use 1970s arguments to face the
challenges of the 1990s,'' said Madeleine Albright, a Dukakis
foreign policy adviser.
   ``It's perfectly understandable that Bush is trying to shift
attention away from Noriega,'' said Chris Edley, Dukakis' top
issues adviser, in a reference to stories about Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Noriega.
   Bush told reporters when asked about a proposal to drop drug
trafficking charges against Noriega if he leaves Panama, ``I said I
would not comment on it ... I'm not willing to answer
hypotheticals.'' But Bush went on to say ``I want to see change. I
want to see him brought to justice.''
   Bush aides denied that the vice president was implying criticism
of any deal with Noriega that would involve dropping the indictment.
   McGovern proposed a 20 percent cut in defense spending when he
was the nominee in 1972. Dukakis has not proposed any such
across-the-board cuts in defense, targeting specific programs for
reduction and some for increases.
   Bush also pushed another theme that he plans to use in the fall
election, linking defense spending to the jobs it creates in this
country.
   ``Some are saying that the government should look elsewhere to
serve the needs of our people,'' Bush said. ``They ignore the
importance of defense research to science and technology,
manufacturing and trade...and contributing to our prosperity.''
   ``Undermining America's aerospace and defense industry will come
back to haunt us _ not just in terms of our national security, but
in terms of our economic security,'' he added. ``The labor force of
tomorrow depends on the technology that we produce today.''

<HEAD>Two More Candidates Killed, Sinhalese Extremists Blamed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen thought to be Sinhalese
extremists killed two more political candidates and wounded a third
despite government overtures to end such attacks, a military
official said Friday.
   All three targets were Sinhalese running for seats on provincial
councils in elections next month and all were from parties
supporting a July 1987 peace accord with Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
three separate attacks on Thursday appeared to be the work of the
People's Liberation Front.
   At least 15 candidates in the provincial elections have been
assassinated. All the killings have been blamed on the
Marxist-oriented Front, which is composed of Sinhalese who think
the Sinhalese-dominated government has been too lenient with Sri
Lanka's Tamil minority.
   On July 29 the government proclaimed a peace plan for ending a
bloody four-year guerrilla war by Tamil separatists, who claim the
Sinhalese majority discriminates against them. Efforts to make
peace with the Tamils caused a backlash among the Sinhalese.
   On Tuesday, President Junius R. Jayewardene announced that a
5-year-old ban on the Front's political activities was lifted.
   Minister of National Security Lalith Athulathmudali said he and
Front leader Rohanna Wijeweera signed a peace accord. Later,
letters issued in Wijeweera's name denied the underground group
reached any understanding.
   The agreement called for the Front to surrender all arms by May
29 and to cease all guerrilla activities immediately.
   In the Thursday attacks, W.K. Siripala, of Jayewardene's United
National Party was shot to death near Ranna, 42 miles south of
Colombo; K.S.L. Fernando, of the United Socialist Alliance, was
killed near Hapugalle, 67 miles south of Colombo, and A.S.
Abeywardene, a United National member, was shot and wounded near
Aluthgama, 36 miles south of Colombo.
   The Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
and the Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   The peace accord with the Tamils was brokered by India, which
now has more than 50,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to disarm Tamil
rebels.
   On Friday, Tamil rebels released Lance Cpl. Dilip Bali Shagakar,
an Indian soldier who had been held captive for more than two
months, in the northern village of Shastrikulankulam.

   The helicopter stunt coordinator for ``Magnum,
P.I.'' was injured Friday when one of the choppers used in the TV
series crashed in a pineapple field during a cargo-hauling flight,
authorities said.
   Steve Kux, 41, was listed in fair condition at Queen's Medical
Center with broken bones and cuts.
   Kux, who did much of aerial work for the CBS series that ended
May 1 after an eight-year run, was hauling equipment for the
Hawaiian Electric Co.
   The Hughes 500-D helicopter, still painted brown with orange and
yellow stripes as it appeared in the series starring Tom Selleck,
apparently experienced electrical problems, said Capt. Elmo Lincoln
of the Waialua Fire Station.
   Two Hawaiian Electric Co. employees pulled Kux from the
wreckage, he said. Lux was the only person aboard.
   Calls to the aircraft's owner, Cherry Helicopters of Honolulu,
were not immediately returned.
   The crash is under investigation.

<HEAD>Judge To Hold Another Hearing Monday In Simmons Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL SIMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLARKSVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said Friday that he will grant
R. Gene Simmons' wish to set a quick execution date if he is
convinced that Simmons is mentally competent to waive his appeal of
the death sentence.
   Simmons, 47, was convicted Thursday of killing a man and a woman
during a 45-minute rampage Dec. 28 in Russellville. After he
surrendered, police found the bodies of 14 relatives on his
property at nearby Dover.
   He is scheduled to stand trial July 18 on those slayings. But
Circuit Judge John S. Patterson said he would hold a hearing Monday
on Simmons' competence and would set an execution date of before
July 18 if he concluded Simmons was not mentally incompetent.
   After he was convicted and the jury set a death sentence
Thursday, Simmons surprised the court by reading a statement
emphatically requesting a quick execution date.
   ``I want no action that will delay, deny, defer or denounce this
very correct and proper death sentence,'' Simmons said in a calm
voice.
   Simmons said that in his case, ``anything short of death would
be cruel and unusual punishment. ... I only ask for what I deserve.
Let the torture and suffering in me end.''
   Simmons' lawyers said they had tried to talk him out of making
the request but had eventually concluded that they had to accede to
his wishes.
   Patterson, who presided over Simmons' four-day trial, refused to
be specific about a sentencing date, except to say it would be
before July 18. State law says the execution date must be at least
30 days after a judgment is entered in a case, which in the Simmons
case is expected to take place Monday.
   The last execution in Arkansas was in 1964.
   John Bynum, who prosecuted Simmons, said Friday that there is no
automatic or mandatory appeal of a death sentence in Arkansas and
that the state would resist any outside group's attempt to block
the execution despite Simmons' stated wishes.
   Under Arkansas law, he said, a person can waive his right to
appeal. He said it would be his position, based on a hearing
conducted Thursday after the sentence was handed down, that ``Mr.
Simmons has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to
appeal.''
   ``My position is that if he demands an immediate execution, he
should be executed,'' Bynum said.
   Simmons was found guilty of capital murder, five counts of
attempted capital murder and first-degree false imprisonment from
the Dec. 28 spree. The jury deliberated less than 1{ hours before
finding him guilty and an additonal two hours before recommending
the death penalty.
   Patterson, following the recommendation, sentenced Simmons to
die by lethal injection and to 147 years in prison on the other
charges.
   The bodies found at the Simmons home included his wife, four
daughters, three sons, two spouses of children, three grandchildren
and a child officials said Simmons fathered by his oldest daughter.
All had been shot or strangled.
   Miss Kendrick, 24, shot at the law office where she worked,
reportedly had spurned Simmons' advances a year before the
shooting. Chaffin, 33, shot at an oil company, was described as a
chance victim.
   ``We're satisfied he's sane and competent ...,'' said Robert E.
Irwin, one of Simmons' attorneys. ``What would you say to people
who contend that you have an obligation to save his life, no matter
what?
   ``The death penalty is here. It's the law of the land. Mr.
Simmons believes what he did warrants the death penalty. He is a
supporter of that penalty.''
   Harris said Simmons didn't plead guilty because he felt like his
best chance of getting the death penalty was to mount a defense.
   Lew Neal, a psychiatrist who examined Simmons, said Simmons told
him that he would have killed himself Dec. 28 if one of his guns
hadn't malfunctioned.

   A judge Friday ordered the former
administrator of Drake Memorial Hospital to spend 30 days in jail
for falsifying the personnel file of Donald Harvey, the former
nurse's aide who has admitted killing 48 people.
   Former Administrator Jan Taylor was sentenced after he pleaded
no contest to falsifying a public document, a misdemeanor offense.
Taylor was indicted last year on four felony charges of tampering
with evidence for adding information to Harvey's file, but he
pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor count as part of a bargain
with prosecutors.
   Families of Harvey's victims were unhappy that Taylor, 50, was
able to avoid a trial that could have developed information for use
in their civil suits stemming from the killings.
   Harvey, 35, is serving three consecutive life terms in the state
prison at Lucasville after pleading guilty to killing 21 patients
when he worked as a nurse's aide at Drake, a hospital for long-term
care, from 1983 to 1987.
   Harvey used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of his victims,
often putting it in the hospital food he served them, authorities
said.
   Harvey also is serving a simultaneous life sentence for
admitting killing nine people at Marymount Hospital in London, Ky.,
while he worked there in 1970-71. The FBI is looking into Harvey's
claims that he also killed 18 people while working at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati before he was hired at
Drake.
   Taylor was accused of putting in the personnel file that
Harvey's references had been checked out with previous employers.
Defense attorney R. Scott Croswell said the information was added
because Taylor believed it was his duty to update the file and make
it complete.
   Taylor, who did not hire Harvey, has said that after the
investigation of Harvey had begun, he noticed the information about
references was lacking and had another Drake employee check the
references and add them to the file.
   Precisely what the hospital had done to check Harvey before he
was hired is a matter of dispute in civil suits by victims'
relatives.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Robert Gorman gave Taylor the
maximum sentence of 180 days in jail, then suspended all but 30
days. He declined to fine Taylor, who could have received up to a
$1,000 fine.
   Gorman said he was giving Taylor a jail sentence because he was
a public figure held to a higher standard than private citizens in
such matters.
   ``This sentence is offered as a deterrent more than a
punishment, and it's a message to others who hold similar office,''
Gorman said.
   Taylor declined to talk to reporters as he left the courtroom.
Gorman said he can remain free for 30 days while he decides whether
to appeal the sentence.
   Relatives of some of Harvey's victims, who sat in the courtroom
Friday, said Taylor and other Drake officials should have stood
trial for their handling of the Harvey case.
   ``I don't really quarrel with the judge as much as I quarrel
with the prosecutor's office,'' said Michael Pike, whose father,
Joseph, 68, was killed by an injection of cleaning fluid last year.
   ``It's a slap in the face to everyone murdered out there,'' Pike
said. ``It's a slap in the face to the families.''
   The victims' families had fought the prosecutor's office to try
to get information obtained in the criminal investigation of
Harvey. The no-contest plea that resulted in the sentencing Friday
cannot be used against Taylor in the civil suits.

   Funny lady Lucille Ball is healthier than her
doctors had thought and will probably be released from the hospital
this weekend, a spokesman said.
   Miss Ball, 76, fell ill at home Wednesday and checked herself
into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   Doctors were still unable to diagnose the cause of the illness,
but she was transferred to a private room Friday and ``should be
released over the weekend,'' said Cedars spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``Her physicians were concerned she had cardiac condition but
now are finding she is basically in pretty good health,'' Wise
said. ``She is feeling much better and it looks like she is going
to be fine.''
   Wise said the hospital had been swamped with phone calls and
flowers for Miss Ball: ``There is obviously an awful lot of
affection for her out there. I know she appreciates it.''

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of pilgrims prayed at
the Roman Catholic Shrine of Fatima on Friday to mark the 71st
anniversary of the reported appearence of the virgin Mary to three
shepherd children.
   Pilgrims walked tens, sometimes hundreds, of miles to the shrine
in central Portugal to fulfill vows made in thanksgiving for the
recovery of a sick relative or in faith of a cure. Many approached
the basilica on their knees.
   Portuguese newspapers quoted church sources as saying Pope John
Paul II may make a brief visit to the sanctuary in August to
beatify two of the shepherds who died in their childhood.
Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
   The Pope visited Fatima in 1982 to give thanks for his recovery
from bullet wounds inflicted by Turkish assailant Mehmet Ali Agca
in Rome's St. Peter Square exactly one year before.
   A rebel Spanish priest tried to stab the pontiff at Fatima. He
was overpowered by security guards and was sentenced to six years
and six months in jail, then expelled from the country.
   The shrine is built near the site of a holm-oak tree where the
three children, then aged 10, nine and seven, said they saw Mary
appear in visions several times between May 13 and Oct. 13, 1917.
   Lucia, the eldest of the children and the only one still alive,
said Mary gave them a message, part of which the Vatican has kept
secret ever since.
   Another part of the message was said to be a description of the
coming horrors of World War II.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said Friday she would not consider running as a vice presidential
candidate on the Republican ticket.
   ``I've said since I went on the bench I'm in my last job,''
O'Connor said while making an appearance at a ground breaking
ceremony at the University of Nevada-Reno.
   O'Connor, 58, has been mentioned by some political speculators
as one of several possible running mates for Vice President George
Bush, the certain GOP presidential nominee.
   O'Connor was selected in 1981 to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court
and was President Reagan's first high court appointee.
   She was in Reno to help university, state and judicial officials
announce the start of construction of a $3.5 million building as
the site of a National Center for Judicial Education.
   The National Judicial College trains a majority of the nation's
judges. O'Connor attended classes there 14 years ago in preparation
for her job as a state judge in Arizona.
   ``The training I received at the National Judicial College must
have been all right,'' she told about 200 people gathered for the
ground breaking, ``because I seem to have progressed somewhat up
the rungs of the judicial ladder.''

<HEAD>Report: Deposed President Would Support Aquino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
said in an interview Friday he would support the government of
President Corazon Aquino if he were allowed to return to his
homeland.
   Marcos made the pledge in an interview with ABC News in which he
again expressed a wish to return to the Philippines for the funeral
of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4 at the age of
95.
   Mrs. Aquino has rejected earlier pleas to allow his return,
saying he is a threat to national security.
   ``My mother is dead and I'd like to go home,'' Marcos said in
slow, somewhat slurred speech from his home in Honolulu.
   ``I will support the Aquino government to prevent any
adventurism or prevent any attempt at the takeover by the
communists,'' he said.
   ``There is nothing that Madame Aquino should fear from me,'' he
said. ``I mean well. And if I should be any obstacle, we will be
able to work it out.''
   Marcos fled to Hawaii after a civilian-military uprising toppled
his 20-year administration and brought Mrs. Aquino to power in
February 1986.
   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attempts
against the Aquino government.
   The Reagan administration barred Marcos from leaving Hawaii
without permission after the Aquino government claimed he had
chartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attempt
succeeded.
   About 8,000 people marched in Manila on Sunday in support of
allowing Marcos' return for the funeral, and more than 1,000
gathered Sunday in Honolulu for a memorial service.

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis on Friday dismissed Jesse Jackson's accusation that
he is too vague, pointing to his record as governor and saying that
Jackson's comparison of him with George Bush ``will come as a
surprise to the White House.''
   Hitting back at Jackson on another topic, Dukakis suggested his
Democratic rival's call for a big spending increase for education
``doesn't make any sense'' in the face of federal budget deficits.
   The Massachusetts governor also spoke to students at a high
school in this San Francisco suburb, warning against illegal drugs
and calling for increased public emphasis on education.
   His wife, Kitty, told students of her own 26-year dependency on
diet pills.
   As he began his California campaign, Dukakis came under fresh
attack from Jackson, who is making a last stand in that state's
June 7 primary.
   Jackson called Dukakis' anti-drug programs ``a farce,'' rejected
his education proposals as inadequate and said, ``Like Bush,
Dukakis almost brags about putting forth no plans.''
   Dukakis responded, ``It will come as a surprise to the White
House and Mr. Bush if my views on the world and my style of
political leadership has any similarity to his. One of the things I
have is a record. People don't have to guess about it.''
   He spoke favorably of a Massachusetts drug abuse education and
prevention program that he contended had reduced drug abuse among
students.
   Speaking to about 200 students at Jefferson High School in Daly
City, Dukakis called for more pay for teachers and said, ``That
means we've got to tax ourselves.''
   He later said he was not advocating a federal tax increase for
education. He said that states and local governments were putting
more tax money into education and that teachers should be a
priority.
   At the same time, he responded negatively to Jackson's call for
greatly increasing the federal education budget.
   ``You can't go around talking about $20 billion more for public
education out of the federal budget when you've got a $170 billion
deficit. That doesn't make any sense,'' he said. ``You've got to
pick your priorities and pick them carefully.''
   With a seemingly insurmountable lead in delegates, Dukakis began
campaigning in California, the state with the biggest delegate
prize, a week after Jackson entered the state.
   The Massachusetts governor stopped briefly in Portland, Ore.,
and was campaigning across California Friday and Saturday with one
more stop in Oregon where he faces Jackson in a primary Tuesday.
   He was endorsed by California state Controller Gray Davis, who
praised his commitment to protect the coastline against oil
drilling.
   Dukakis turned aside questions about a running mate, saying he
would not focus on that until after the California primary.
   When asked if he could choose someone who had supported aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras _ aid that Dukakis opposes _ the governor
said no single issue would be a disqualification.
   ``I'm not going to be looking for a clone of Mike Dukakis,'' he
said.
   Dukakis later called for a renewed commitment to education in a
speech to students at California State University-Long Beach.
   He offered a few details on his plan for a $250 million National
Teaching Excellence Fund, including spending to forgive college
loans if students become teachers, and a network of retired
teachers providing specialized classroom instruction in math and
science.
   ``We all know that the next president will inherit an ocean of
Republican red ink,'' Dukakis said. ``He and the Congress will have
to make hard choices on spending. ... And for me, the highest
priority is teaching.''
   For a second day, Dukakis jabbed at Reagan over disclosures the
president's wife consulted an astrologist in determining his
schedule. Dukakis said he had checked the horoscope for himself and
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and in both cases, ``It said we
were going to be changing our positions.''

<HEAD>Tennis Coaches Removed after Racial Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORREST CITY, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school tennis coach was fired
and another resigned after one had a visiting black athlete play
her match at a city court while her white teammates competed at an
all-white country club, officials said.
   Teresa Whitfield, a 16-year-old ninth-grader and the only black
on the Earle High School tennis team, was to play a Forrest City
High School opponent April 26 at Forrest City Country Club.
   But Forrest City coach Charles Bowlin told her she would have to
play her match on a city court, school officials said.
   Bowlin announced his resignation as tennis coach but will remain
on the teaching staff. Calls to his home were not immediately
returned Friday.
   On Thursday night, Earle tennis coach Jack Hosford was relieved
of his coaching duties but kept on as a teacher. Hosford's number
is unlisted, and he could not be reached for comment.
   ``We felt his decision not to bring the whole team home
following the incident was not a wise one,'' said Earle's school
superintendent, Bobby Clark. ``He has done a good job teaching for
us. He will not be penalized beyond the coaching duties.''
   Embarrassed members of the Forrest City School Board drafted a
formal apology to the black teen-ager Thursday night, said board
President Marlene Zaleski. The board ``deeply regrets this
incident,'' she said.
   In addition, the board adopted a policy that calls for the
firing of those who disobey board policies on racial equality. It
also calls for training of school personnel ``so that there will
not be any form of discrimination.''
   School officials at Earle refused to allow a reporter to talk to
Miss Whitfield by telephone. Calls to her home Friday went
unanswered.
   Dan Dennis, president of the country club, said the Forrest City
High School golf team has used the club's course for two years and
has hosted teams with black players without incident.
   Dennis said he assumed Bowlin ``knew it was all right'' for
blacks to play at the club. He said the club has no written policy
prohibiting black members but has no black members.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said
Friday that talks with the United States about his departure from
power have collapsed.
   At ceremonies in this rural town marking the anniversary of the
death of a revolutionary hero, Noriega also told The Associated
Press he could run for president in elections next year.
   ``Everything fell apart. Everything fell apart. Everthing
apart,'' Noriega repeated when asked about the talks between Panama
and the Reagan administration to try to resolve the Panamanian
crisis.
   Noriega is chief of Panama's defense forces and the power behind
the civilian government. He was charged in Miami in February with
taking at least $4.6 million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellin
cartel to protect cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug
laboratories and shelter the gang's leaders from law enforcement.
   Reagan administration officials had said they were discussing
with Noriega the possibility of dropping the drug charges if
Noriega relinquished power.
   When asked in Washington about Noriega's remarks, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater replied, ``He says that all the time. He
said `fall apart' or something similar before. ... We are still
talking. We are still negotiating.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Friday presented Reagan with
arguments against dismissing drug charges against Noriega,
according to U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner of Miami, who obtained one
of the indictments.
   Kellner told reporters he met Meese twice this week to argue
against such a move and that Meese told him ``he also opposed''
dismissal and ``would convey my thoughts to the president.''
   ``He told me he did that today,'' Kellner added.
   Kellner said it ``would send the wrong message'' to Americans
because the government is cracking down on drug traffickers and
users.
   ``How do we continue ... going after the little fish when the
big fish can walk away?'' Kellner asked.
   U.S. Customs Service Chief William von Raab, whose agency's
investigative efforts contributed to the drug indictments against
Noriega, also said on Friday that Noriega ``should be prosecuted.''
   Noriega visited La Negrita, 90 miles from Panama City, where
Victoriano Lorenzo, a populist revolutionary, was executed by
Colombian authorities on May 15, 1903.
   Although Panama did not gain independence from Colombia until
six months later and although Lorenzo was not fighting for
independence, he is considered a precursor and martyr of Panamanian
nationalism.
   Noriega did not address the crowd of several hundred peasants
and other supporters from nearby towns. Instead, he listened to
three speeches by local authorities denouncing ``Yankee
aggression.''
   As he descended the platform, Noriega was asked if he could run
for president in elections scheduled for next May.
   ``Legally, yes,'' he answered with a broad smile, surrounded by
an adulatory crowd.
   Asked if he was actively considering running for president,
Noriega merely laughed.
   On hand was a ``dignity battalion'' of about 100 men. They had
vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans, T-shirts printed
with ``not one step backward,'' and red-and-white baseball caps
saying ``I don't sell out my country.''
   Several such battalions have been formed in recent weeks as the
U.S.-Panamanian crisis deepened and authorities warned of the
danger of a U.S. invasion.
   ``Here, there, the Yankees will die,'' chanted the crowd.
``Against the aggression, popular militias,'' they also chanted.
   Accompanying Noriega, who was dressed in a camouflage combat
uniform, were acting chief executive Manuel Solis Palma, several
Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen military officers.
   Later Friday, during a meeting in Rio Hato, 60 miles southwest
of Panama City, Noriega said of State Department envoy Michael
Kozak: ``Mr. Kozak is here. I have not talked with Mr. Kozak.''
   ``The dignity of Panama is not negotiable while there are
foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while there
is economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long as
there is psychological war ... as long as (U.S.) Ambassador Arthur
Davis does not get out.''
   He spoke with journalists during a meeting with representatives
of local governments from around the country.
   Noriega's lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal
of the drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges are
politically motivated.
   Noriega and Panamanian government officials contend there simply
is nothing to negotiate with Washington.
   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle, now in
hiding, as Panama's legitimate president. Noriega dismissed him
Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   In New York, Panamanian opposition leader Ivan Romero, who was
expelled from his country May 6, told The Associated Press in an
interview that he plans to return to Panama on Monday to continue
his struggle against the government.
   Romero, secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Party,
said Friday he was arrested, beaten with a rock, questioned and
held overnight in prison May 6 before being forced onto a plane to
Miami.

   A co-executor of the
George Rose estate arrived Friday to survey property owned by the
slain Broadway actor, a U.S. Embassy official said.
   The New York attorney may also take care of the final deposition
of Rose's body, placed in a funeral home in the capital Santo
Domingo, said the embassy official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It was not known when the body might be returned to New York. A
memorial service is planned at the Shubert Theater for May 25.
   Rose was 68 when he was slain May 4.
   According to the embassy spokesman, the attorney did not want to
be identified, had no plans to meet with the news media and did not
know when he planned to leave the Caribbean island and return to
New York.
   The attorney traveled 160 miles northwest to the tourist town of
Sosua, where Rose owned a beach home for nine years. It was also
near Sosua, where he was beaten to death.
   Police had announced Thursday that four men, including Rose's
18-year-old adopted son and the youth's father, had been charged
with murder in connection with Roses's death and one of the four
was being sought by authorities.
   The three _ Rose's adopted son, Domingo Antonio Ralfe Vazquez,
called Juan; the young man's natural father, Juan Antonio Vazquez
Padilla, and the youth's uncle, Maximo Padilla Vazquez _ appeared
at a news conference and told reporters they plotted the actor's
slaying.
   The natural father accused Rose of being involved in homosexual
activity and of prostituting his son, which he said prompted him to
plan the slaying.
   Still at large is Luis Manuel Toribio.
   The natural fathers' sworn statement also said the Broadway
performer was held for eight hours before he was killed and
attempts were made to make the death look like an accident.
   The death of the British-born Rose, winner of Tony awards for
``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' and a revival of ``My Fair Lady,''
had originally been blamed on a single-car accident.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly Friday to
order the U.S. military to enter the war against illegal drug
trafficking, approving a plan to give the Navy the power to stop
drug boats on the high seas and make arrests.
   The chamber voted 83-6 approval of an amendment outlining a
wide-ranging anti-drug plan for the military.
   The proposal provides more surveillance by Air Force and Navy
planes, a bigger anti-drug role for the National Guard and more
Pentagon helicopters for the Coast Guard and Customs Service.
   The most controversial provision would require Navy vessels to
track suspected drug boats in international waters and would allow
Navy officers to arrest suspected drug traffickers. The officers
would be temporarily ``deputized'' by Coast Guard officers who
would be aboard for that purpose.
   The anti-drug provision was the main unresolved issue as the
Senate worked toward approval of a bill authorizing defense
spending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Passage by the Democratic-controlled chamber will send the bill
to a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile differences
between it and the separate Pentagon bill approved Wednesday by the
House. Both measures authorize $299.5 billion for the Pentagon.
   One major difference will be the anti-drug provision. The House
measure orders President Reagan to have the military
``substantially halt'' the flow of illegal drugs into the United
States.
   ``I think we have a chemical war being directed against the
United States,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed
Services Committee.
   But he warned that the military help won't solve the problem.
``Let no one believe that we're going to pass a piece of
legislation and solve the drug problem, but we can improve it. ...
I think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far past
the stage where interdiction came stop it.''
   Other senators warned that drugs have become a national security
menace, but they also acknowledged that the military plan won't
solve the problem.
   The loudest critic was Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who accused his
colleagues of ``posturing on this.''
   ``We all get up, posture, make our little statements, and it
isn't going to make any difference,'' said Glenn, arguing that the
U.S. lacks a coordinated or effective nationwide anti-drug program.
   ``It's absolutely ludicrous to think this will solve the
problem,'' he said.
   The Pentagon has resisted a larger role in the war against
drugs, saying the military is not trained or equipped for the
assignment.
   The Senate anti-drug plan was hammered out in three days of
meetings by senators who put together parts of two competing
proposals. Also involved in the talks were Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said, ``We have reached a point
where drugs are becoming an enemy equal to any foreign enemy.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said he formally opposed involving
the military, but said he changed his mind because ``the drug flow
has reached flood tide.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the plan
``shows that we're serious about drugs.''
   An 1878 law, the Posse Comitatus Act, prohibits the military
from enforcing civilian laws, although it was amended in 1981 to
permit the military to provide more help to civilian anti-drug
agencies. Military planes and ships now pass along surveillance
information on suspected drug traffickers to law enforcement
officials.
   But the Posse Comitatus Act is only effective inside the
territorial borders of the United States.
   Voting against the amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.;
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Dan Evans,
R-Wash.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.
   Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Albert Gore,
D-Tenn.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.; Chic Hecht,
R-Nev.; David Karnes, R-Neb.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; John Kerry,
D-Mass.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.
   All other senators voted in favor of the amendment.
   As it worked through the bill Friday, the Senate:

carriers Midway and Coral Sea faster than the Navy wanted.

proposes $3.5 billion for SDI.

<HEAD>Art Institute Draws Up Public Apology For Mayor-In-Lingerie
Picture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Art Institute of Chicago and its school drew
up under pressure from City Councial a full-page advertisement
Friday apologizing for a student painting of the late Mayor Harold
Washington in lingerie.
   ``It contains an apology for the distress and concern that the
painting caused to the community,'' Art Institute spokeswoman
Eileen Harakal said of the advertisement, which will run in Sunday
newspapers.
   The prestigious museum and school have been under fire since
Wednesday, when City Council approved a resolution threatening to
cut off subsidies to the institute if it did not take down the
painting and apologize publicly.
   Later Wednesday, a group of black aldermen stormed into the
school to remove the picture by David Nelson. Police subsequently
impounded the painting.
   Titled ``Mirth and Girth,'' the painting depicts Washington in a
frilly white bra, panties and stockings, with a pencil in hand.
   At a meeting of black ministers Friday, the Rev. Willie Barrow,
executive director of the civil rights group Operation PUSH,
described the painting as ``the latest in a series of escalating
attacks and insults against the black community.''
   Washington was black; the artist is white.
   ``We would like to see calm in the community,'' said Ms.
Harakal. ``We never intended for there to be any unrest in the
first place and want to put the entire incident behind us and move
on.''
   The amount received by the institute in city subsidies was not
immediately known.
   Meanwhile, the Art Institute received dozens of calls Friday
from people supporting an artist's right to show his work, Ms.
Harakal said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and students at the school
have threatened to sue the police and aldermen for allegedly
violating the artist's civil rights.
   A group of 200 students approved a statement Thursday saying the
Constitution guarantees the right to display the painting, whether
or not its content is offensive.
   The painting, which was defaced with a five-inch gash on
Washington's left shoulder, was returned to Nelson by police
Thursday after the ACLU intervened with the city corporation
counsel, said Jay Miller, ACLU executive director.

<HEAD>Appeal to Halt `Chain Reaction' of Asylum Refusals in Southeast
Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees should
call an international conference to stem a ``chain reaction'' among
Southeast Asian countries toward cutting off temporary asylum for
people fleeing Vietnam, a private U.S. refugee relief organization
said Friday.
   The United States, which has taken in about 1 million refugees
from Indochina, must strongly support the move, said the
Washington-based U.S. Committee for Refugees.
   Unless the U.S. government gives the problem new priority, it
will be to blame for ``permitting a vital, humanitarian initiative
to drift into dissolution,'' the group added.
   ``Thailand lit the fuse in January, when it began to push back
Vietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines,''
committee director Roger Winter said in a statement.
   ``What we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction to
bar asylum throughout the region,'' he said, citing increased
resistance to temporary asylum on the part of Indonesia, Malaysia,
Hong Kong and the Philippines.
   ``We have known for some time that Indonesia has been pushing
boats back'' to sea, but the first evidence that it was costing
lives came April 24, when Indonesian soldiers shot and killed one
refugee and wounded another as a boat carrying 125 people attempted
to land, Winter said.
   The vessel finally managed to land at the Malaysian camp of
Pulau Bidong four days later, he said. But he added that Malaysia
has announced it will close this camp within a year and intends
``no longer to adopt a soft attitude to these illegal immigrants.''
   Hong Kong and the Philippines also are reviewing their temporary
asylum policies, Winter said, declaring, ``first asylum countries
in the region are seeking a new, restrictive consensus'' on
tightening of their policies.
   He gave these data on refugee problems since the start of 1988:
   _Thailand: More than 1,500 Vietnamese have been pushed back in
operations that caused 170 deaths.
   _Malaysia: In the first quarter of the year, 2,921 Vietnamese
landed.
   _Hong Kong: The year began with a camp population of 9,532, more
than 40 percent of whom had been in camps more than three years. A
Hong Kong official has urged that future arrivals be detained for
return to Vietnam.
   The U.S. State Department has said it is in close consultation

permanent resettlement to follow temporary asylum.

   The swift cooperation between China and Taiwan in
handling the hijacking of a jet from the mainland is the latest
sign that tensions are easing between the rival governments.
   Taiwan on Friday returned the hijacked Boeing 737 to China hours
after it landed at a Taiwanese military base with 118 people aboard.
   The Nationalists in Taipei and the Communists in Beijing have
been bitter enemies since they fought a bloody civil war in the
1930s and 1940s. The Nationalists fled to the island province of
Taiwan in defeat in 1949. Each side continues to call itself the
legitimate ruler of all of China.
   Contact between Chinese on the two sides of the 100-mile wide
Taiwan Straits was forbidden by both governments for decades, and
the two sides technically remain at war. But since about 1980,
China has made peace overtures, and Taiwan has begun to ease its
stubborn resistance to all links with the mainland.
   Unofficial contacts between the two sides have increased due to
China's decade-long pursuit of an ``open-door'' policy and Taiwan's
lifting of martial law last fall.
   The greatest step in re-establishing ties came in October when
Taipei loosened a 38-year-old ban on travel to China and began
allowing those with relatives on the mainland to return for family
reunions.
   Since then, more than 65,000 Taiwanese have come to China and
another 75,000 have received permission to make the trip, Taiwan's
Interior Ministry reported last week.
   Indirect mail contact also has been established, with the
International Red Cross relaying mail from Taiwan to the mainland
and correspondence in the other direction going through Hong Kong.
   China's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in April again
urged that direct mail contact be established.
   Indirect trade is flourishing, also with Hong Kong as an
intermediary. Such trade totalled at least $1.51 billion last year,
up 58.7 percent from 1986.
   Merchants on Taiwan, who in the past surreptitiously invested in
businesses in their mainland ancestral towns, have begun openly
putting millions of dollars into mainland enterprises. China's
official Xinhua News Agency said last week that 36 Taiwanese
businesses had invested a total of $28.5 million in Xiamen, a
leading southeastern port.
   Both the Nationalists and the Communists seek reunification, but
only on their own terms. China says Taiwan's capitalist system
could remain untouched under the same ``one-country, two systems''
reunification plan that will be put into effect when Hong Kong, a
British colony, returns to China in 1997.
   Under that program, China says Hong Kong will be able to keep
its capitalist system for at least 50 years following reunification.
   The first signs of softening between the governments came in
1986, when the pilot of a Taiwanese airliner flew his plane to
Canton.
   Representatives of the Communist and Nationalist authorities met
in Hong Kong to arrange the return of the plane in their first
official contact since 1949. It took nearly three weeks to reach an
agreement.
   A desire to avoid a repeat of the 1986 negotiations may have
been behind Taiwan's swift handling of Thursday's hijacking.
   Taiwan granted political asylum to the two young hijackers but
quickly refueled the plane and allowed it to return across the
Taiwan Straits to Xiamen, where the flight originated.
   The head of China's national airline, CAAC, who earlier
requested the return of the plane, crew and hijackers, sent a
message to the Civil Aeronautic Bureau of Taiwan thanking it for
its cooperation. He made no mention of the two air pirates left
behind.
   Taiwanese officials said Friday morning they ``allowed'' the
plane to leave and said it was flying to Hong Kong. It actually
flew directly to China.
   On Saturday, Taiwanese military officials said the Taiwan
Garrison Command recommended that two hijackers _ Zhang Qingguo,
27, and Long Guiyun, 26 _ be prosecuted for the air piracy.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
command recommended Friday that the Taipei District Court charge
the two with endangering flight safety.

   Aerial acrobats filled the skies here Friday at
the opening of the country's first large-scale international
aerospace exposition, Air@Space America '88.
   Vice President George Bush, Gov. George Deukmejian and Mayor
Maureen O'Connor praised the 10-day event at Brown Field as a
showcase for American aviation and space know-how.
   A stunt pilot warmed up the crowd of several thousand with
climbs, dives and rolls, then flew his 1940 Waco biplane
upside-down, eight feet off the ground, and cut a red ribbon
stretched across the runway with the plane's tail.
   A Navy precision parachute team and flyovers by the B-1 bomber
and World War II-vintage aircraft followed.
   The air and trade show, patterned on the biennial expositions at
Paris and Farnborough, England, opened with an invitation-only
preview for dignitaries and representatives of more than 300
aviation and electronics companies.
   Representatives from 48 foreign countries also were invited as
prospective customers for the exhibitors, which include aerospace
and defense companies such as General Dynamics, Hughes Aircraft,
Martin Marietta and Teledyne.

   The Taiwan Garrison Command recommended
that two Chinese hijackers, already granted political asylum here,
be prosecuted for forcing a Chinese jetliner to Taiwan, officials
reported Saturday .
   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
command recommended Friday that the Taipei District Court charge
Zhang Qingguo, 27, and Long Guiyun, 26, with endangering flight
safety. The maximum sentence for committing such a crime is the
death penalty.
   Lawmakers of the governing Nationalist Party said in a statement
issued Friday, ``They (the hijackers) had noble goals, but their
methods were mean.'' The two young workers commandeered the Boing
737 shortly after it took off Thursday evening with 118 people
aboard from communist China's coastal city of Xiamen in Fujian
province. The two men made the pilot fly to a military air base in
central Taiwan.
   After more than five hours in Taiwan, authorities allowed the
plane to return to Xiamen early Friday morning with everyone aboard
except the two hijackers, who were quickly granted asylum. No one
was hurt.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said Friday the two hijackers
were allowed to stay because they would have faced ``their doom''
if sent back home. While denouncing hijacking, he called their
motives ``simple and noble.''
   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan from the
Chinese mainland after losing a civil war to the communists in
1949, still claims to be the rightful ruler of all China and
remains technically at war with Beijing.
   A group of nine legislators, however, condemned the two
hijackers for threatening the lives of passengers aboard the plane
and urged the government to treat them as criminals and put them on
trial.
   It was reported earlier that authorities and lawmakers here were
concerned that the quick granting of asylum would tarnish Taiwan's
image.
   The incident was the first hijacking of a Chinese commercial
airliner to Taiwan.
   ``We would have been sending them to their doom if we turned
them back to the communists,'' Shaw said.
   ``They have risked their lives to seek freedom and democracy. We
must respect their wishes and offer them protection.''
   In a television interview, the air pirates triumphantly detailed
their do-or-die mission.
   Zhang, a worker at an arsenal in south China's Yunnan province,
told the official Chinese Television Service he and his companion,
Long, a steelworker from neighboring Guizhou province, used a toy
pistol and a bottle of fake explosives to force the plane to Taiwan
late Thursday.
   ``We would have committed suicide if we failed,'' Zhang said in
the televised interview. ``We never planned to return (to China).''
   In 1983, six Chinese hijacked a Chinese airliner to South Korea
and spent less than a year in jail there before resettling in
Taiwan, where they received a hero's welcome and financial support.

<HEAD>Cyprus Turns Back Lebanese After Car Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Friday turned back 13
Lebanese who arrived from Beirut, in line with toughened security
checks after a car bomb explosion killed three people and wounded
15 in the Cypriot capital.
   President George Vassiliou said police would take ``greater
steps to check foreigners'' who enter Cyprus following the
Wednesday blast, which police said was planned by two Lebanese men
and was a bungled attack on the Israeli Embassy.
   The 13 were among 53 passengers, mostly Lebanese, who were
aboard the regular Middle East Airlines Flight 261 that landed at
Larnaca Friday.
   Buland Sadek, Cyprus station manager for the Lebanese national
airline, said police told him the 13 were declared not welcome and
ordered to return to Lebanon. Their passports were not given entry
stamps and they later flew back to the Lebanese capital aboard the
same plane when it made its return flight.
   An immigration department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said entry was refused because the 13 had ``not enough
reason for staying in Cyprus.''
   Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
sent a message to Vassiliou denouncing the bombing.
   A government announcement said Arafat's message also expressed
condolences for the victims.
   The explosion brought angry demands for strong action against
Middle East terrorism on this Mediterranean island nation.
   Vassiliou said counter-terrorist units would be reinforced,
``particularly with a view to follow up the activities of Arab
visitors.''
   The local PLO office issued a statement shortly after the blast
denying involvement and denouncing ``this ugly crime.''
   Earlier, an anonymous caller telephoned the American television
network NBC in New York claiming responsibility for the blast in
the name of the notorious anti-Arafat Palestinian terrorist leader
Sabri al-Banna, better known as Abu Nidal.
   Police kept the explosives-laden car from parking in front of
the embassy, and it exploded on a bridge 200 yards away, killing
the driver and two Cypriot passers-by.

   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis came under
attack from his right and left Friday as Republican George Bush
labeled him ``naive at best'' on defense and Jesse Jackson said the
Massachusetts governor has failed to come up with an effective plan
for fighting drugs.
   Dukakis kept up his criticism of the administration's handling
of negotiations aimed at persuading Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to relinquish power. Noriega is under indictment in the
United States on drug charges.
   The vice president told reporters when asked about the
negotiations, ``I said I would not comment on it.'' But he went on
to say, ``I want to see change. I want to see him brought to
justice.''
   Bush told workers at a Hughes Aircraft Corp. plant in Fullerton,
Calif., that ``the Dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful
thinking.'' He said the Soviets respect only strength and ``to
think that they would agree to cuts in their strategic and
conventional arsenals in the face of unilateral American
abandonment of major weapons programs is the height of folly.''
   Jackson met privately in San Francisco with New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, who afterward praised both Democratic candidates and
restated his belief that ``the front-runner after California and
New Jersey should be supported at the convention.''
   Cuomo, appearing with Jackson at a news conference following
their 1{-hour meeting, said the Democrats ``need Jesse Jackson
personally. If not as the nominee, and he is surely the underdog,
we need his wholehearted participation in the process.''
   Cuomo hailed Dukakis as ``a man of great intelligence, great
sensitivity and great practicality.''
   In keeping with Cuomo's unified-party theme, Jackson muted his
criticism of Dukakis during the joint appearance, saying he and his
Democratic rival ``fundamentally are on the same side of history.''
   But in an interview published Friday, Jackson said Dukakis' drug
war plan is ``a farce,'' and he described the Massachusetts
governor as sounding little different from Bush on various issues.
   All three presidential candidates were in California, the last
big prize of the primary season and, more importantly, the biggest
bloc of electoral votes at stake in the general election.
   Strategists in both parties regard California, with 47 electoral
votes, as crucial to the prospects of both Bush and Dukakis. The
two likely rivals appeared to be campaigning with an eye to
November rather than to the June 7 primary.
   With more than enough delegates for the GOP presidential
nomination, Bush was using his campaign appearances as to attack
Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee.
   The Massachusetts governor expects the final round of Democratic
primaries on June 7, including New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana
as well as California, to give him the delegate majority he needs
for the nomination.
   Dukakis said he has not begun to consider the selection of a
running mate.
   Asked if he would consider someone who had supported aid to the
Contra rebels in Central America, Dukakis replied that no single
issue would be a disqualification.
   ``There's no way under the sun I could possibly pick a running
mate who agreed with me on every single issue,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to be looking for a clone of Michael Dukakis.''
   Jackson refused to let up on his criticism of the party
front-runner.
   In an interview with The New York Times, Jackson compared
Dukakis to Bush:
   ``Both of them brag about being vague. Both of them are trying
to make bland beautiful. ... Like Bush, Dukakis almost brags about
putting forth no plans. Like Bush, Dukakis says I have not said
anything concrete to anybody about anything.''
   In an appearance at a drug treatment center in Los Angeles,
Jackson said Dukakis ``has not put forth a comprehensive plan and
the president's plan is limited.''
   Dukakis was in Daly City, a San Francisco suburb, and he
responded to Jackson's statements by saying, ``It will come as a
surprise to the White House and Mr. Bush if my views on the world
and my style of political leadership has any similarity to his.''
   Dukakis said the Massachusetts program of drug prevention and
education had brought a significant reduction in drug use among
students.
   He used a speech to high school students about drug abuse to
renew his attack on reports the administration was considering
dropping drug charges against Noriega if he agrees to relinquish
power.
   ``We are not talking about stealing hubcaps,'' he said.
   Bush portrayed Dukakis' views on defense as similar to those of
George McGovern and to the left of those of former President Carter
and former Vice President Walter Mondale.
   ``Even Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale supported (weapons)
systems that Governor Dukakis opposes,'' Bush said. ``The
governor's views are naive at best, and if implemented would be
dangerous to the defense of this country.''
   Madeleine Albright, a Dukakis foreign policy adviser, responded,
``What Bush is trying to do is use 1970s arguments to face the
challenges of the 1990s.''

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo on Friday praised
Jesse Jackson's leadership, vision and contributions to the
Democratic Party, but firmly restated his neutrality until after
June 7 in the race between Jackson and Michael Dukakis for the
Democratic nomination for president.
   Cuomo and Jackson held a joint news conference following a
1{-hour private meeting, which Cuomo said he requested.
   Cuomo, who ranked near the top of many polls of presidential
contenders until he unequivocally ruled out a draft on his behalf,
praised both Jackson and Dukakis and said the differences between
them were minor.
   Agreeing with Cuomo's unified-party theme, Jackson muted his
recent criticism of Dukakis during the news conference and joined
in praise of the Massachusetts governor, saying, ``We fundamentally
are on the same side of history.''
   ``I do not believe Michael Dukakis would handle (allegations of
impropriety by Attorney General) Ed Meese the way (Vice President)
George Bush has. Mike Dukakis would handle South Africa quite
differently from George Bush,'' Jackson added.
   Jackson was campaigning in San Francisco for California's June 7
Democratic primary, where 336 delegates are at stake. Cuomo was in
the city to deliver a fund-raising address for Democratic Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.
   Cuomo brushed aside questions of why he asked Jackson to meet
with him by joking that it helps him politically with some groups
to be seen with Jackson.
   The two described their topics of discussion as politics and
unifying the Democratic Party after the nominating convention in
July.
   Cuomo said he didn't think Jackson's recent criticism of Dukakis
as someone who lacks vision would hurt the party, saying: ``I think
this is a legitimate and productive process.''
   Responding to questions about his plans for endorsing a
candidate, Cuomo repeated his earlier statement that ``the
front-runner after California and New Jersey should be supported at
the convention.''
   That position almost guarantees Cuomo's eventual endorsement of
Dukakis. According to The Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis
has 1,597 and Jackson has 944. A total of 2,081 delegates are
needed to nominate.
   But Jackson immediately praised Cuomo's stand on an endorsement,
saying that ``waiting until after June 7 is the appropriate thing
to do. That was the governor's commitment, and he has remained true
to his position.''
   Cuomo balanced his references to what appears to be a future
Dukakis endorsement with lavish praise of Jackson.
   ``The Democratic Party needs (the) Rev. Jackson for his personal
input, for his personal capacity, for his ability to deal with the
issues intelligently _ not just to articulate them, which he does
with eloquence and effectiveness, but understanding the issues,
especially questions of foreign policy,'' Cuomo said.
   He said the party needs ``Jesse Jackson personally. If not as
the nominee, and he is surely the underdog, we need his
wholehearted participation in the process.
   ``If anyone fails to see that, then they don't deserve to be in
positions of leadership in our party,'' Cuomo said.
   Dukakis is ``a man of great intelligence, great sensitivity and
great practicality,'' Cuomo said, adding, ``I'm certain he knows as
clearly as I do, and perhaps more clearly, how important Jesse is
to the process.''
   In other appearances Friday, Jackson continued to put the fight
against drugs at the center of his presidential platform, and he
criticized the ``Just Say No'' anti-drug campaign sponsored by the
administration.
   Earlier at a Los Angeles-area treatment center, Jackson shook
hands with addicts, blasted street gangs and said Dukakis lacks a
strong anti-drug policy during a campaign stop at a narcotics
treatment center.
   ``So far, the governor has not put forth a comprehensive plan,
and the president's plan is limited,'' Jackson said. ``There is the
Jesse Jackson proposal, there is the Reagan-Bush proposal. At this
time there is no other for the war on drugs.''
   As he campaigned in Oregon and Los Angeles, Jackson criticized a
proposed deal between the Reagan administration and Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under indictment on drug
charges.
   ``It's not enough to just say no out of one side of the White
House, then have drug dealers on the CIA payroll on the other side
of the White House,'' he said at a Portland, Ore., news conference.
``Our children's lives are at stake.''

   A Royal Air Force training jet crashed
Friday less than 300 yards from this village, which escaped a
similar crash two years ago, the RAF and police said.
   The instructor and trainee pilot parachuted to safety and no
injuries were reported.
   Lawmakers called for an inquiry of the incident in which a Hawk
training jet that had taken off from a nearby RAF base at Brawdy
crashed after developing engine trouble.
   Barbara Jones, a resident of the village, witnessed the crash.
   ``I saw the plane shaking uncontrollably,'' she said. ``The next
second it hit a field and plowed through a hedge before exploding.
Another few hundred yards and it would have hit our village.''
   In July 1986, a U.S. Air Force Phantom jet crashed into the sea
off Newgale during the base's annual air display. Two U.S. airmen
died.

   Poets lit candles and released 11 balloons
Friday to mark the moment three years ago that police bombed a
rowhouse held by the radical group MOVE in a fiery battle that left
11 people dead.
   Meanwhile, police girded against the possibility of violence by
MOVE members in the now-rebuilt neighborhood devastated by 1985
fire. Barricades manned by police officers were erected at either
end of one street.
   At a memorial service, about 50 people listened to poetry about
the battle. At 5:27 p.m. about 40 lit candles at the exact time
police dropped the bomb to dislodge a rooftop bunker. The bomb
touched off a fire that destroyed 61 houses.
   Lamont B. Steptoe released 11 white balloons and his voice
echoed off nearby Independence Hall as he recited a poem in which
he said, ``The fire has never gone out _ there will always be a
fire for us.''
   The tone at the ceremony was decidedly bitter, with participants
criticizing the long-awaited report of a grand jury that
investigated the event for two years. The grand jury last week
blasted blasted Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other city officials for
``morally reprehensible behavior'' but recommended no criminal
charges.
   ``Justice has to be served before you can forgive, I think,''
said Bob Small, who read some of his poetry. ``It's like they had
the Nuremberg trial, then found the Nazis innocent.''
   At Osage Avenue, the site of the shootout and fire, 5:27 p.m.
came and went with few people noticing the time. Children rode
bikes and scooters in the narrow street and a number of people sat
in front of rowhomes rebuilt two years ago.
   A MOVE member not involved in the battle was released from
prison Friday after serving time for her role in an earlier
confrontation with police, and there was concern that MOVE members
would gather on the street as they had done for the last two years
on May 13.
   Earl Watkins, sitting in front of his rebuilt house almost
directly across from the site of the old MOVE house, said he hoped
they would not show.
   ``This is my prayer that nothing happens tonight _ in fact I'm
hoping that this is the end of it anyway,'' said Watkins, 76.
   ``We went through all that mess and then every year we have to
put up with this,'' Watkins said, gazing down the street at the
barricade where a TV truck had pulled away. ``I think this is the
end of it _ I think it will be if the media let it go.''

   A lethal computer virus called ``Black Friday''
was timed to destroy thousands of computer files in Israeli
businesses and homes on Friday the 13th, but experts said most
users were alerted in time.
   No early reports of damage surfaced.
   ``Virus'' is computer jargon for a fragment of computer program,
or software, that can copy itself into other programs and usually
is destructive.
   An unidentified saboteur planted the Black Friday virus and it
spread to thousands of personal computers this year as users copied
or used each others' software.
   Infected computers were hit in two ways. The virus slowed down
the computer and also specified that programs activated on Friday,
May 13, would be wiped out.
   Data stored in the computers would not be affected.
   ``It's a time bomb that penetrates your computer without your
being able to know about it,'' said Shay Bushinsky, a Tel
Aviv-based computer consultant.
   ``The perfect analogy is AIDS. If you don't exchange programs
with others, you remain immune, but if you freely copy your
friend's software, you are in danger of being contaminated.''
   No figures were available on the extent of the contamination
among Israel's 90,000 personal computer users, but Bushinsky
estimated that the infection rate reached 100 percent among heavy
users.
   Hebrew University researchers detected the Black Friday virus on
Dec. 24 because of a flaw in its design, said Yisrael Radai, a
senior programmer at the university.
   Instead of infecting each program once, the virus attached
itself to the program every time it was used, consuming increasing
amounts of memory space.
   Computer experts noticed that supposedly static programs were
growing in size. After an intensive search they isolated the virus.
   The university then developed ``anti-viral'' software and made
it available to the school's hundreds of personal computer users
free of charge, said Radai.
   To be on the safe side, users affiliated with the university
were also urged not to activate their computers on Friday, May 13,
he added.
   Software companies joined the fight.
   The Tel Aviv-based Iris company developed an anti-virus program
and sold 4,000 copies, said President Ofer Ahituv. He estimated
that 30 percent of his company's 6,000 customers, most of them
businesses, had been infected.
   Ahituv and other computer experts said they had no immediate
reports of damage Friday, apparently because most users were warned
in time.
   Black Friday was the first destructive virus to contaminate
personal computers in Israel, but programmers predicted there would
be others.
   They said one reason Israeli users are vulnerable is that
software prices here are about twice as high as in the United
States, and many Israelis freely copy programs, often disregarding
copyright restrictions.
   Ahituv speculated that the saboteur may have been a frustrated
programmer ``who finally got fed up because everyone was copying
his software, and then said `let all the software be destroyed.'''

   A Middlebury College council Friday
recommended a year's suspension for a fraternity that hung a
mutilated, bloodied female mannequin from a balcony during a toga
party.
   The council, made up of students, faculty members and staff,
deliberated four hours before reaching the decision.
   The recommendation goes to college President Olin Robison, who
has the final say on the fate of Delta Upsilon, which dangled the
mannequin from its fraternity house last weekend.
   The council recommended the fraternity be banned and its members
prohibited from living in the house for a year, after which the
council would decide whether to close the fraternity, suspend it
another year or allow its return on probation.
   The council also recommended that fraternity members and others
at the 1,950-student liberal arts college participate in a
sexism-awareness program, said college spokesman Ron Nief.
   ``I'm definitely pleased that some sort of awareness program
(will begin),'' said Jennifer Weiss, a student who wrote a letter
of complaint about the incident. ``I think that the point I was
interested in making was brought to light. Hopefully, the awareness
will continue.''
   The president of Delta Upsilon at Middlebury said that the
punishment was too stiff and that publicity about the incident
influenced the council's decision.
   ``I felt in some ways we were guilty before we were even
tried,'' said Mark Lahive. ``It was not aimed to be a public
display against women at all. ... There was no harm intended. ...
It wasn't a statement at all.''
   Lahive said the fraternity would ask its alumni to lobby on the
group's behalf.
   Weiss and six other students wrote a letter to Robison that said
the mannequin was hung with a rope around its neck, its head bashed
in and its breasts dripping with what looked like blood.

   Chet Baker, 59, an American jazz
trumpeter famed for his 1950s appearances with Gerry Mulligan, died
Friday after falling from the second floor of his Amsterdam hotel.
   Famed for the thin, cool tone of his trumpet playing, Baker set
the the standard for what jazz buffs knew as the ``cool school.''
   In 1952, he was working with Charlie Parker on the West Coast
when he joined Mulligan, a baritone saxaphonist, and the rest of
his piano-less quartet.
   In 1953, Baker topped the Metronome trumpet poll and started his
own quartet. His work became more assured and outgoing. In 1955 he
took a group to Europe that showed high promise. Then his career
started to suffer, from narcotics, arrests, headlines and a
backlash against the fact he'd been overrated at the beginning.

   Sidney ``Cap'' Hebert, a well-known jazz
musician and a founder of one of the first Dixieland bands in Cajun
Louisiana, died Friday at the age of 87.
   Hebert, whose melodic phrasing and mellow tones were reminiscent
of the Bix Beiderbecke style, played trumpet and piano.
   He helped found The Louisiana Six, one of the first Dixieland
bands in Acadiana. The band, organized in the early 1920s, was
built around three Hebert brothers and one sister.
   The group played mostly in south Louisiana dancehalls, before
nightclubs became popular and cut an album long before recordings
became popular.
   After retiring from his musical career, Hebert continued to play
at the annual New Iberia Sugarcane Festival.

   Virginia's attorney general Friday said
that an ex-Marine cleared by a military jury in the 1983 rape and
attempted murder of another soldier's wife cannot be tried in state
court for the offense.
   Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, responding to an inquiry from
Prince William County Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Ebert, said that
bringing former Cpl. Lindey Scott to trial in state court would
amount to double jeopardy.
   Scott, 32, of Louisville, Ky., was convicted in a court-martial
in 1983, but the verdict was overturned on appeal. He was found
innocent at a second court-martial Feb. 19 after more than four
years in prison.
   He was discharged from the Marines after his acquittal.
   Earlier this week, Ebert, whose jurisdiction borders Quantico
Marine Corps Base, where the alleged attack took place, said he was
unconvinced of Scott's innocence, and he asked Terry if he could
prosecute Scott.
   After Ebert questioned Scott's innocence, John Leino, one of
Scott's defense attorneys, charged, ``Apparently, they're going for
the best two out of three.''
   ``Here we are months after the trial and the state prosecutor of
Prince William County wants to take a shot at him,'' he said.
``Who's next, Manhattan South?''

   A policeman held hostage for eight hours
by two robbery suspects escaped unharmed Friday after he grabbed a
gun and killed one of his drug-impaired captors, police said.
   The second suspect later killed himself, state Medical Examiner
Dr. Larry V. Lewman said after autopsies on the two men.
   Officer Larry Strayer, 43, a seven-year veteran of the force,
was unharmed, police said.
   ``Please get me out of here,'' the officer said at one point
during his ordeal. ``They indicated this is the last time I can
talk on the radio. If anybody rushes the door, I'm dead.''
   The dead men were identified as Michael Richard Ager, 37; and
Albert Wesley Reinhart, 42, both of Tacoma, Wash.
   Lewman said Reinhart was shot three times by Strayer, dying from
wounds to his chest and lungs. Strayer shot Ager once in the leg,
and Ager later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest,
Lewman said.
   The officer was taken hostage about 8 p.m. Thursday when he went
to the Portland Rose Motel to question the men about the robbery of
a nearby supermarket earlier in the evening. The men demanded
Dilaudid, a form of morphine, and safe passage out of the motel.
   At 4 a.m., Strayer seized a gun from his captors, firing about
five times and wounding at least one of them before escaping, said
police spokesman Henry Groepper.
   The men's drug problems may have made it easier for Strayer to
flee, Groepper said.
   ``The individuals ... apparently had a strong need for drugs,''
he said, and were ``very irritable.''
   ``I think the time just wore them out.''
   Gunshots were heard inside the motel room on two occasions after
the officer escaped, but there was no exchange of gunfire with
officers outside, Groepper said.
   After lobbing tear gas into the room and getting no response,
police sent a remote-controlled, camera-equipped robot device into
the room and discovered the bodies at about 10:30 a.m.
   Reinhart was arrested April 22 on robbery, theft and weapons
charges and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, said Multnomah
County sheriff's spokesman Jim Davis. Reinhart posted bail on the
firearm charge May 4 and the remaining charges were dropped because
there was no complainant, Davis said.
   Ager was arrested May 2 on robbery and weapons charges and
unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. The charges against him also
were dismissed, Davis said.
   During the 14{-hour standoff, authorities closed a two-mile
stretch of Interstate 5 and nine blocks of Barbur Boulevard, a
major roadway. Traffic was backed up for miles during the morning
rush hour, and several businesses on Barbur were unable to open
Friday morning.
   Strayer was checking a tip that two suspicious men were staying
at the motel, located near a grocery store that was robbed about 7
p.m. He was admitted to the motel room by one man, Groepper said.
   Groepper said other officers brought a witness from the store
robbery who identified the man as a suspect. But as the officers
were handcuffing him, another man emerged from the bathroom and
pointed a gun at police.
   He said the gunman took Strayer hostage and forced the other
officers out of the motel room.
   Groepper said Strayer was unavailable for interviews.

   The number of AIDS cases jumped at least 72
percent worldwide, with the epidemic concentrated in the Americas
and spread in three distinct geographic patterns, the World Health
Organization reports.
   In a report published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, the WHO says 34,913 cases of AIDS had been reported for
1987 as of March 21.
   That brought the global total to 88,091 in the seven years since
the disease was detected, the report said. It also noted that 1987
reporting is not yet complete and the total so far represents a 72
percent increase over 1986.
   By comparison, the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome increased 92 percent from 1985 to 1986 and 110 percent
from 1984 to 1985.
   The report came on the eve of a meeting here on how to stop AIDS
from spreading among U.S. school-age youth. More than 100 educators
from across the country were expected to attend the three-day
conference, which begins tonight and is co-sponsored by the CDC and
the National Education Association.

   Federal scientists are abandoning efforts to

than a quarter-billion dollars, because every use of such devices
has resulted in the eventual death of the patient.
   From now on, government research support will concentrate
instead on developing a smaller pump that can assist, rather than
replace, a failing heart.
   ``There are still a lot of problems'' that cannot soon be solved
with a total heart replacement device, Dr. Claude Lenfant, director

   Every attempt at total heart replacement has resulted in a
patient dying of either infection or stroke caused by blood clots
that develop within the mechanical heart, said Lenfant.

   The discovery of chemical abnormalities in
depressed teen-agers intent on killing themselves could provide a
better understanding of suicide and help identify those likely to
self-destruct, researchers say.
   ``The things we learn on this may well help future tests to
identify the highest risk for suicides, and that can make a
difference in the treatment,'' said Dr. Neal D. Ryan, assistant
professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.
   The brains of suicidal adolescents secrete smaller amounts of a
growth hormone than those of healthy teen-agers, according to
research by Ryan and Dr. Joaquin Puig-Antich, professor of
psychiatry at Pitt.
   The study, reported Thursday at the American Psychiatric
Association's annual meeting in Montreal, is believed to be the
first to demonstrate neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal
adolescents.
   ``It's not purely a mind phenomenon,'' Ryan said. ``There's
something that goes on with the brain, and there are environmental
phenomena that impinge on that.''

   Close to 900,000 acres of national forest and

federal employees, officials at a Senate hearing said.
   William L. Rice, deputy chief of the Agriculture Department's

forests has become a ``billion-dollar'' industry since the early
1970s and is increasingly violent.
   He told a Senate Agriculture subcommittee that 886,000 of the
191 million acres of the government land were closed because of the
threat posed by growers. Rice said his law enforcement agents are
hampered by the legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana
growers for investigative purposes.

   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in April despite the biggest jump in energy prices in more than 15
months, the government said Friday.
   The April increase in the Producer Price Index was down from a
0.6 percent March advance, leading many analysts to conclude that
worries over inflation had been overstated by the March increase.
   They said if the volatile energy and food sectors were removed,
the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent.

   Willie B. found it's a jungle out there.
   Zoo Atlanta's famous gorilla saw something Friday he hasn't seen
since he was captured in Africa 27 years ago: green grass beneath
his feet and open sky above his head.
   As reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and
across a protective moat, the 30-year-old lowland gorilla stepped
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters, a $4.5 million simulated
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of
other apes.
   Skeptical of those watching him, he spent almost an hour
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed
secure enough to run atop his hill, scamper for food and begin
ripping down tree limbs.

   It wasn't as lavish as Charles and Di's, but
when two ``Sesame Street'' characters exchanged vows Friday, it was
the wedding of a lifetime, at least for those whose lifetime was
less than 10 years.
   Eight pairs of eyes were locked on the television set in Shirley
Foster's home as Maria and Luis got married in the season finale of
the children's program.
   As in most ``Sesame Street'' segments, there was a lesson to be
learned.
   ``Love is when somebody likes another person and they decide to
get married,'' said Shemeka Fennell, 7, who had the day off from
school and got to join the group at Mrs. Foster's house in New York
City.

<HEAD>Arquette Didn't Want to Meet Character in `Promised a Miracle'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It would seem unlikely that a woman who allows
her son to die could be a sympathetic character, but she is when
Rosanna Arquette plays her in the CBS movie about obsessive
religious belief, ``Promised a Miracle.'' So it was surprising to
hear Arquette say with some vehemence that she was so repulsed by
what Alice ``Lucky'' Parker and her husband, Larry, did that she
didn't even want to meet them.
   ``Promised a Miracle'' is based on Larry Parker's book, ``We Let
Our Son Die.'' The Parkers were so convinced that their diabetic
son, Wesley, had been healed by God that they stood by while he
lapsed into a coma and died. Even then, they thought he would rise
from the dead, like Lazarus.
   The movie, airing Thursday, is a simple, highly emotional story
and therefore a real actors' vehicle. Judge Reinhold, best-known
for such comedies as ``Beverly Hills Cop'' and ``Ruthless People,''
takes a rare dramatic turn. He and Arquette turn in stunning
performances as the fundamentalist couple clinging to their beliefs
rather than facing the horror of what they have done.
   Arquette played a real-life character before, in her critically
acclaimed performance as convicted killer Gary Gilmore's
girlfriend, Nicole, in the made-for-TV movie ``Executioner's
Song.'' For that role, Arquette met the real Nicole. This time she
didn't meet the real-life characters until playing the role
convinced her they weren't monsters.
   ``I had such strong reactions to the script and what they did, I
didn't really want to meet them in the beginning,'' said Arquette.
``I think this was a terrible tragedy and what they did was
horrible thing. I ended up meeting them towards the very end, like,
the last day of shooting.
   ``When I first read the script, my initial reaction was like
shock, and I was so angry. How could people let this happen? Then I
found out from the producers that it's happening all around the
country. It happened yesterday. A 2-year-old girl had bowel
obstruction, her parents prayed over her, and she died.
   ``In a situation like that, when you could save a child's life,
especially with something like insulin for a diabetic, it's wrong.
It really is. So I didn't have a sympathetic point of view at all
until I started playing the character.''
   In a touching courtroom scene, Lucky is on the witness stand
trying to explain why she believed so fervently in the ``miracle.''
The family had fallen on hard times after Larry was laid off.
   ``This miracle, this wonderful thing came along, and it was
gonna lift us up,'' Lucky says. ``It was gonna put us back on our
feet _ if we believe it. We had to believe it or give up on life.''
   The Parkers had help believing, from their pastor (John
Vickery), who finally, reluctantly suggested they should consult a
doctor to ``verify'' the healing, and from Lucky's prayer group.
They all believed that Wesley's worsening symptoms were the work of
Satan, testing their faith.
   The Parkers accept their son's death only after a wrenching
revelatory scene that so mortifies Larry he bolts from the house
and runs down the road, leaving Lucky screaming in the front yard.
   ``So it was very powerful,'' Arquette said. ``Judge Reinhold and
I had a very hard time. We shot it in 20 days, intense schedule.
And also, as we were doing those scenes, I could not believe that
this was happening, how could they have let this happen? And I got
ill from it, really.''
   The movie was ably directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, who also
directed the NBC-TV movie ``Open Season: The Abduction of Kari
Swenson.''
   Arquette is best-known for her starring role opposite Madonna in
``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' but she won praise for her earlier
work in John Sayles' independent feature film, ``Baby It's You,''
and she also starred in Martin Scorsese's black comedy ``After
Hours.''
   After a stop in New York to plug the CBS movie, she was on her
way to the Cannes Film Festival in France where her latest feature,
a French-American film directed by Luc Besson, ``The Big Blue,''
was set to premiere.

<HEAD>Small-Business Survey Points to Expansion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economic outlook continues to improve,
although with a growing bias toward higher wages and prices,
according to the latest quarterly survey of small businesses.
   Based on written responses to a detailed questionaire, the
business people expressed faith in higher sales over the next three
months and supported that view with plans to expand employment.
   The survey, for the 500,000-member National Federation of
Independent Business, also found a record-low level of planning to
borrow, suggesting smaller businesses are finding profits and cash
flow sufficient for their needs.
   The low level of borrowing tends to insulate smaller businesses
from the impact of the recent tightening of monetary policy, and
separates them sharply from the heavy borrowing by government,
consumers and financial markets.
   In releasing the results, Professor William Dunkelberg, dean of
Temple University's business school and originator of the survey,
commented that ``monetary policy does not appear to have been
particularly restrictive during the last four years, nor is credit
availability a problem now.''
   Other commentators have observed that the reliance on internal
financing rather than borrowing, reflects not only a distaste for
the level of interest rates but a lingering fear of the tight
credit conditions of the 1970s.
   The small-business survey is closely watched for indications of
things to come, since the companies involved employ about one-half
the private non-farm work force and produce about 50 percent of
gross national product.
   Dunkelberg reported that the small-business optimism index,
compiled since 1974, rose to 102.2 from 101.8 in January on a
seasonally adjusted basis, continuing a pattern of slightly above
or below 100 since 1985.
   The index, which assumes conditions that existed in 1978 equal
100, reached a seasonally adjusted high of 108.7 in January 1984
and a low of 81.1 in April 1980.
   The index is compiled from data distilled from the survey and
includes expected business conditions, the climate for expansion,
earnings, job openings and hiring plans and plans for capital
outlays.
   While the April report was generally bullish, and even stronger
than that of January, Dunkelberg observed that companies have
become decidedly less optimistic about future expansion each April
since 1983.
   ``Apparently, many believe that the law of gravity applies to
economic statistics as well as apples,'' he said, noting that
``views about the possibility of further growth are about as weak
now as in 1980.''
   However, he added, that while the numbers might be similar, the
reasons for them are not.
   In 1980, he said, 48 percent of respondents expected a
deterioration of the economy, ``while in 1988, particularly in many
regions of the country, businesses just figure it can't get any
better.''
   Among details of the report:
   _Twenty-five percent of all companies plan to increase total
employment in the next three months, while 5 percent plan
reductions.
   ``These are the second strongest hiring plans recorded since
1978 on a seasonally adjusted basis. The strongest were recorded
last January.''
   Hiring plans were especially strong in manufacturing, with 33
percent planning to increase employment and only 4 percent planning
reductions.
   _Although plans to raise prices fell from January levels, over a
longer period ``there has been a clear upward shift'' in such
plans. Dunkelberg based this conclusion on a comparison with
figures for April in the prior two years.
   _``With job openings at expansion-high levels, there is still
little evidence that compensation might be responding to any
tightness in the labor market.''
   Nevertheless, Dunkelberg observes that this year ``could deliver
a bit more inflation than currently expected.''

<HEAD>Reagan by the Books: The Portraits Generally Agree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen men and women who know
Ronald Reagan or have served him in the White House have written
books, and they largely agree on a portrayal of an affable yet
hesitant chief executive manipulated by a protective wife and an
image-conscious staff.
   From the White House chef to the Reagan offspring, Michael
Reagan and Patti Davis, from the disenchanted economic whiz, David
T. Stockman to the secretary of state who left in a huff, Alexander
M. Haig, almost all sing the tune sung by Michael Deaver, who was
so close to the Reagans they considered him a son.
   ``Ronald Reagan sort of glided through life,'' Deaver said in
``Behind the Scenes.'' He said he and Nancy Reagan ``became a team,
united by our shared belief that her husband needed to be
protected, whether he wanted it or not.''
   Over and over, the books make the point _ Reagan is a benign
president who had to be manipulated for his own good:
   _Haig, in ``Caveat: Realism, Reagan and Foreign Policy''
describes the president as a sort of shadowy figure. ``Because of
his (Reagan's) habitual courtesy, it is at times difficult to know
when he is agreeing or disagreeing, approving or disapproving,''
Haig wrote, describing the president as ``a listener, absorbing the
views of his advisers'' who ``gave little indication of his own
position.''
   _Larry Speakes, the former presidential spokesman, caused a
sensation in his book, ``Speaking Out,'' in disclosing that he felt
he knew Reagan so well he could feed the press quotes on crucial
international matters that Reagan never made.
   _Stockman portrays Reagan as a well-meaning, yet simple man.
Reagan ``did not appreciate the vast web of confusion and
self-delusion I was creating'' in 1981 when he concocted the tax
and budget cuts to be pushed through Congress, Stockman wrote in
``The Triumph of Politics.''
   _Donald T. Regan, former chief of staff, in the most recent and
most devastating book, ``For the Record,'' says Reagan was
programmed by his staff to run through a daily schule as a movie
actor runs through a shooting schedule. ``This fascination with
image produced a strange effect,'' Regan wrote. ``Ronald Reagan
seemed to be regarded by certain members of his inner circle not as
the powerful and utterly original leader that he was, but as a sort
of supreme anchorman whose public persona was the most important
elements of the presidency.''
   _Scholar Martin Anderson, former assistant to the president for
policy development, in ``Revolution,'' complains of Reagan's
undemanding nature: ``Ronald Reagan ... had one distinctive
personality trait that was highly unusual, perhaps unique for
someone who rose to the high level of managerial responsibility he
attained. He made no demands and gave almost no instructions.''
   _From former White House chef Henry Haller comes the tamest,
most harmless, expose: Chef Haller confides that the man who loves
``simple home-style meals'' of macaroni and cheese, hamburger soup
and meat loaf, also sneaks in duck a l'orange at stag lunches or
dinners when his wife is out of town.
   There are contradictions in these portraits. If Reagan is such a
voracious newspaper reader _ as both Deaver and Regan contend in
their works _ how can the president say he didn't know Speakes put
those dramatic words in his mouth?
   Yet even when many profess personal admiration for the
president, the descriptions that emerged were less than kind.
   Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a
specialist on the presidency, says each book ``must be read through
the filter of who these guys are and what's bugging them,'' but
that each one also provides ``a piece of the mosaic.''
   ``It's the parable of the blind men and the elephant _ each one
is touching a different part and describing it differently,'' Hess
said.
   Taking note of Regan's and Stockman's books, Hess pointed to
their underlying common theme.
   ``What comes through in all the books, from the earliest on, is
what at best could be called a hands-off presidency and at worst,
an inattentive one,'' said Hess. ``It's interesting that the same
president who is on the cover of Fortune Magazine touting his
management style, is also the same president who presided over the
problems of the Iran-Contra affair.''
   The most recent book to capture the headlines has been Regan's,
primarily for its revelation that the first lady controlled the
president's schedule, in consultation with an astrologer.
   Regan bolsters the negative image put forward by Stockman,
Deaver and Speakes.
   In his book, Regan faults the president for a ``distaff
presidency'' that was hesitant and indecisive. He charged that
Reagan ``laid down no rules and articulated no mission'' for his
cabinet officers. ``This ... is dangerous,'' Regan wrote.
   He describes a president so unwilling to bother others that he
sat in his West Wing office, eyes smarting, even though smoke
billowed from a clogged chimney.
   Here is how Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute on
the campus of Stanford University in California, characterizes
Reagan: ``He is highly intelligent, with a photographic memory. He
has a gift for absorbing great amounts of diverse information and
is capable of combining various parts of that information into new,
coherent packages and then conveying his thoughts and ideas clearly
and concisely in a way that is understandable to almost anyone.''
   But Anderson says Reagan made decisions ``like an ancient king
or a Turkish pasha, passively letting his subjects serve him.
Rarely did he ask searching questions and demand to know why
someone had or had not done something.''
   Stockman, recalling a 20-minute lecture he gave the president on
taxes, wrote: ``What do you do when your president ignores all the
palpable, relevant facts and wanders in circles? I could not bear
to watch this good and decent man go on in this embarrassing way.''

   And if Reagan is faulted for being an out-of-touch president,
adopted son Michael hits him for being a distant father. ``I've
spent my life trying to figure out how to make Ronald Reagan my
friend,'' Reagan said after publication of his book, ``From the
Outside Looking In.'' He quoted his father as saying, ``My God, I
though just telling you I loved you was all I had to do.''
   Lou Cannon, the White House correspondent for the Washington
Post who has covered Reagan since his days in California, says no
one should be surprised by the descriptions of Reagan's hands-off
style.
   ``If anyone interested in the presidency didn't know we had a
laid-back president, they must have been on Mars,'' Cannon said.
``I never could understand Stockman's book, that he was surprised
Reagan was such a delegator and a softie.''
   Cannon also pointed to another theme running through the books.
``This administration had done a lot to foster the notion that
greed is good, and these authors clearly demonstrate that,'' he
said, noting the million-dollar advances some books have garnered.
   Cannon, who wrote the authoritative ``Reagan'' in 1981 and has a
second book on the president due a year after he leaves office,
said books by administration aides show how much Reagan depended
upon the people he chose to work with. It functioned well with
someone like James Baker III working as his chief-of-staff, but not
someone like Regan, Cannon contended.
   ``Regan's management style was to eliminate everybody else,''
Cannon said. Ever since his days in California, Reagan worked with
a round-table style where he heard his advisers out and then made a
decision, the writer said. ``He did it in California, and he's
doing it today ... (These books) won't change his style.''
   Ironically, Education Secretary Terrel H. Bell, whose department
was targeted for destruction in the early days of the
administration, comes to Reagan's defense in his book, ``The
Thirteenth Man.''
   Bell takes issue with Stockman, contending the embittered
director of the Office of Management and Budget really didn't
understand the president and how he worked.
   Reagan ``often made decisions on budget and other matters that I
did not like, some of which made me angry. But I never felt that
his policies were aimless or wandering or lacked clear focus,''
Bell wrote. ``Ronald Reagan made decisions David Stockman did not
like. Maybe this was the source of Dave's complaints .... Ronald
Reagan was a decisive leader and it is inaccurate to portray him
otherwise.''
   Regan does manage to defend Reagan _ and himself _ from the
charge that they knew anything about the diversion of funds to the
Contra rebels from the sale of weapons to Iran.
   And at times, Regan's book did give the president credit for
being alert and interested in complicated issues. Four days after
his surgery for colon cancer, the president held a 45-minute
discussion of ``the budget, the tax reform bill and the future of
Social Security'' during a visit with Vice President George Bush,
Regan wrote.
   The former chief of staff also contended that the process Reagan
used ``created an atmosphere of confidence and political dynamism''
that allowed the longest period of economic recovery and the
highest levels of employment ever to flower.
   Stockman argued, however, that Reagan's dream of a minimized
central government never had a chance because the president lacked
the stomach to take on the welfare state. ``He was a consensus
politician, not an ideologue,'' Stockman said. Revolution ``wasn't
in his bones.''
   Deaver, who had worked with Reagan since his days as governor of
California, warned in his book that many have underestimated Reagan
because of his uncomplicated ideas and style.
   ``There it is again _ a man whose simple tastes are said by his
enemies to match his intellect. That judgment has cost them many a
victory,'' Deaver wrote.
   Another theme threading through the Deaver and Regan books is
the invasive role of the first lady.
   Regan asserts that Mrs. Reagan checked ``virtually every major
move and decision'' with an astrologer. ``By humoring her, we had
given her control,'' Regan wrote. ``No one except me, and least of
all the president, was disposed to interfere with that.''
   It has received little notice in the rash of stories zeroing in
on the first lady's fascination with astrology, but Regan wrote in
his forward that the practice ``did the country no irreparable
damage.''
   Although Deaver never told of the star-gazing, he described the
first lady as a woman who had a pervasive amount of influence, in
personnel matters as well as policy.
   Because Reagan was ``completely unable to deal with close
personal conflict,'' Deaver wrote, ``when problems arose related to
the family or with the personnel in his office, Nancy had to carry
the load.''
   ``She lobbied the president to soften his line on the Soviet
Union; to reduce military spending and not to push Star Wars at the
expense of the poor and dispossessed. She favored a diplomatic
solution in Nicaragua and opposed his trip to Bitburg. Nancy wins
most of the time. When she does, it is not by wearing him down but
by usually being on the right side of an issue,'' Deaver wrote.
   The reading public has only to wait to find out more secrets _
not only is former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane
reportedly working on a book, Education Secretary William Bennett
promises one, too.
   Both the president and the first lady have warned they'll tell
their side of the story _ and they say they are taking notes.

   Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, the
first setback in six months, with the decline blamed on an early
Easter, bad weather and a bigger federal tax bite for some people.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that consumers spent a
seasonally adjusted $131.6 billion at retail stores last month, a
drop of $815 million from the revised March figure.
   Economists said they weren't concerned by the weakness,
especially because sales in March were revised upward to show an
increase of 1.7 percent. That was the fastest sales advance since
last August and almost twice the originally estimated 0.8 percent
gain for the month.

   These economists maintained Thursday that unlike the in 1970s,
when price spirals became ingrained, the economy of the 1980s has
been reshaped by fundamental changes that have restrained costs and
wages, two key components of inflation.

   The FCC plan, announced on Thursday, calls for scrapping current
limits on the profits American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and local
phone companies can earn on the interstate portion of their
businesses and setting caps on prices the companies can charge. The
companies could opt for price caps or for current regulation.

two days after Lorimar agreed to become part of Warner
Communications Inc.
   Davis, who previously offered $17 per share for the maker of
such hit TV series as ``Dallas'' and ``Knots Landing,'' notified
the company Thursday that he would pay $15 cash per share, or
$679.5 million.
   Lorimar values the tentative stock swap agreement it made with
Warner Tuesday at $1.18 billion, including assumption of $550
million in Lorimar debt.

   Oil prices have slipped lower in listless
trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, June contracts for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude grade, closed at
$17.48 per barrel, down 1 cent from Wednesday's close.
   Among refined products for June delivery, contracts for
wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.33 cent to 51.92 cents per
gallon, while wholesale heating oil dropped 0.23 cent to 47.23
cents per gallon.
   John H. O'Connell, an analyst at the Refco Inc. commodities
trading firm, said trading was slow due to a lack of market-moving
news.
   ``It got a good-sized runup yesterday, and gave some of that
back today,'' he said.
   O'Connell was referring mainly to the June unleaded gasoline
contract, which rose 0.63 cent per gallon Wednesday after a report
by the American Petroleum Institute showed heavy stock drawdowns
last week.
   Shrinkages in inventories and production encouraged traders to
buy in anticipation that shorter supplies might lead to higher

<TEXT>
   Levolor Lorentzen Inc., which pioneered the
manufacture of decorator window mini-blinds, may be up for sale
because of a rift among family members who own the 77-year-old
Parsippany-based company.
   The privately-held company has hired an unidentified broker to
evaluate its worth and marketability, according to a company
spokesman.
   ``There's a family dispute. The family dispute does not affect
day-to-day operations,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The problem apparently centers on the stake controlled by Jane
Lorentzen, the widow of one of the company founder's three
children. She holds between 40 percent and 49 percent of Levolor's
stock, said Levolor's general counsel, Bohdan Porytko.
   The other major shareholders are Chairman Eric Lorentzen _ who
has majority voting control _ and his sister, Karen Lynam. They and
Jane Lorentzen's husband H. Peter Lorentzen, who was vice chairman
and died three years ago, are the offspring of company founder Hans
K. Lorentzen.
   Porytko would not comment in detail on the family squabble, but
did say Jane Lorentzen had approached other stockholder family
members ``to discuss what could be done to make the shares held by
(Peter Lorentzen's) estate more liquid.''
   Family discussions, after the broker's evaluation, could lead to
a number of options, he said. Porytko would not rule out sale of
the Jane Lorentzen stake to other family members or the company's
sale to an outsider.
   According to an industry source who spoke on condition of
anonymity, several home furnishing concerns have examined the
possibility of buying Levolor, but have dropped the idea.
   Eric Lorentzen could not be reached for comment Thursday and did
not return a telephone message.
   But in a statement last week, he said:
   ``My father who founded the company, Hans K. Lorentzen, would
state that everything is for sale at the right price except my wife
and children. It should be pointed out, given that philosophy, that
the company has remained in the Lorentzen family for 77 years.''
   Levolor has become one of the most recognized brand names in the
so-called ``alternative window covering'' business with its
colorful and fashionable mini-blinds, replacing the image of
old-fashioned wide, dusty Venetian blinds.
   Through marketing that captured the imagination of designers,
interior decoration magazines and consumers, Levolor has taken a
major portion of the more than $1.2 billion wholesale market for
``hard'' window coverings with its 1-inch mini-blinds, half-inch
micro-blinds, vertical blinds and pleated blinds.
   The company did a ``brilliant job of marketing, of developing, a
product consciousness as well as a brand consciousness,'' said
Donald Hogsett, business editor of the trade publication Home
Textiles Today.
   Levolor claims as its innovations an early device that better
lowers and raises blinds evenly and a plastic wand to operate the
slats.
   In fact, the company derives its name from the leveling device,
``Lev;'' a wheel symbol representing it, ``o;'' and the first three
letters of the family name, ``lor.''
   Porytko said 1987 sales were between $200 million and $300
million. The company has been valued at $100 million, but Porytko
disputes the figure.
   Levolor's 3,000 employees work at 20 locations nationwide. Its
major buyer is Sears, Roebuck and Co.

<HEAD>Ford Looking for 30 Percent Contribution to Earnings From
Financial Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is building its financial services
division as well as it core automaking business and is seeking a
major acquisition in the electronics industry, Ford Chairman Donald
Petersen said.
   The No. 2 automaker has about $10 billion in cash reserves and
has been seeking a major acquisition for some time, but Petersen
said he's in no hurry.
   ``We've become quite impressed by how many more poor
acquisitions have been made than good ones'' by other companies,
Petersen told reporters after the company's 33rd annual
shareholders' meeting on Thursday.
   Petersen estimated Ford's Financial Services Group eventually
would contribute as much as 30 percent of corporate profits due to
expansion and acquisitions. He did not give a time frame, however.
   The financial services division, which includes Ford Motor
Credit and First Nationwide, currently contributes about 18 percent
to Ford's earnings.
   At General Motors Corp., financial services contributed 42
percent of 1987 earnings, but GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the
figure was higher than usual because of very low automotive
earnings.
   By contrast, General Motors Acceptance Corp., the subsidiary
which contains GM financial service businesses, contributed about
26 percent of GM's earnings in 1985.
   Petersen also said Ford would reduce its equity in Hertz. He
said the company bought the auto rental and leasing firm as ``a
defensive move.''
   ``Hertz could have been acquired by a company that would not
continue the close relationship with Ford'' in buying Ford cars, he
said after the meeting.
   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said Ford owns at least 90 percent of
Hertz, with Hertz management holding the rest of the company.
   Petersen said Ford has raised its forecast of 1988 auto industry
sales, imported and domestic, to 15.3 million _ 10.2 million cars
and 5.1 million trucks _ from 15 million forecasted earlier.
   ``We think the general economy is going on quite well,''
Petersen said after the meeting, adding ``there's every reason to
believe our economy will continue its modest growth in 1989.''
   Attendance at Friday's annual meeting was the lowest in Ford's
history, coinciding with a year in which Ford's earnings were the
highest in automotive history.
   Ford earned $4.6 billion in 1987 and another record $1.6 billion
in the first quarter of 1988.
   It also was the first meeting since Henry Ford II's death and
the first meeting since Ford's son, Edsel Ford II, and his nephew,
William Clay Ford Jr., were elected to Ford's board of directors in
January.
   Henry Ford II died in September at age 70. Edsel Ford II, 39, is
general sales manager of the Lincoln-Mercury Division. William Clay
Ford Jr., 30, is chairman and managing director of Ford Switzerland.
   The two young Fords and William Clay Ford Sr., vice chairman of
the board, represent the Ford family's 40 percent voting interest
in the company.

<HEAD>Officials: Halliburton To Acquire Gearhart In Stock, Cash Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Halliburton Co. has agreed to acquire
Gearhart Industries for about $275 million in cash and stock, the
oilfield services companies have announced.
   But a Houston-based oil service company, challenging the merger
plan, has doubled its position in Gearhart senior debt notes, and
the businesses face other hurdles in the plan.
   Energy Service Co. has acquired $37.2 million in principal
amount of the 8|-percent senior subordinated notes issued by
Gearhart, officials said. That raises Ensco's ownership of senior
notes to $66.7 million in principal amount, which represents a
majority of that debt series class, officials said.
   The additional debt notes acquired ``gives us a controlling
position in that class of Gearhart debt,'' said Cris Gaut, Ensco's
chief financial officer. The Halliburton-Gearhart merger plan
``wasn't a done deal,'' Gaut said.
   The acquisition was contingent on final agreements with Gearhart
creditors, and approval by Gearhart shareholders and federal
regulators.
   U.S. Justice Department officials said they were reviewing the
plan.
   In the plan, Gearhart common and preferred shareholders would
receive less than proposed in an earlier offer, so that Halliburton
can increase the payout to holders of Gearhart debt and redeemable
preferred stock.
   Halliburton, under the definitive agreement, would exchange
.02917 of a share of its own stock for each outstanding share of
Gearhart common stock and three series of Gearhart preferred stock.
   Target date for completing the merger is Aug. 31, according to
Chairman Marvin Gearhart.
   Halliburton closed Thursday at $32.37{ a share, up 87{ cents on
the New York Stock Exchange. Based on that price, the stock swap
would be worth about 94 cents per share of Gearhart, which closed
at about 87{ cents a share, down 6.25 cents, on the NYSE.
   In a tentative agreement announced Feb. 24, the initial exchange
ratio was for .03575 shares of Halliburton for each Gearhart share.
   Officials said the exchange ratio was lowered in order to
increase the amount paid to holders of certain Gearhart senior
debt, subordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock. These debt
and securities holders would receive about $230 million in cash.
   In late February, the companies first announced merger plans.
The much-smaller Gearhart is based in Fort Worth and provides
wireline and geophysical services to the oil industry that aid in
the location of petroleum deposits.
   It posted a loss of $3 million in the year ended Jan. 31 on
revenue of $297.3 million. Gearhart had a $337 million loss in its
previous fiscal year.
   Dallas-based Halliburton provides oilfield services and also is
involved in construction, engineering and insurance. Halliburton
posted a first quarter profit of $31.8 million, or 30 cents a
share, on revenue of $1.04 billion.

<HEAD>Navistar Deal To Sell Off Wisconsin Steel Called `Sham'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp.'s sale of its
money-losing Wisconsin Steel unit in 1977 was part of a strategy to
leave the steel business, not an attempt to avoid pension
obligations to workers, a company attorney says.
   But lawyers for two plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the
Chicago-based manufacturing concern said Thursday they would prove
Navistar misled Wisconsin Steel's buyer into believing the company
could be profitable.
   The long-awaited U.S. District Court trial that began Thursday
is considered an important test case to determine whether _ and to
what extent _ a company can be forced to honor pension-plan
obligations to workers.
   Navistar faces two lawsuits resulting from the ill-fated 1977
sale of Wisconsin Steel to Envirodyne Inc., a Los Angeles-based
engineering company with no previous steel-making experience.
   The South Side Chicago steel mill went bankrupt eight years ago,
putting 3,500 employees out of work and leaving the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., the federal insurer of pensions, with the tab for
unpaid pension benefits.
   In the bench trial before U.S. District Judge James Moran, the
pension insurer is seeking $140 million from Navistar to cover the
unpaid benefits plus interest.
   And Wisconsin Steel creditors, led by an Envirodyne unit, the
EDC Holding Co., have filed a separate lawsuit seeking triple
damages of nearly $475 million from Navistar.
   That suit alleges fraud and racketeering in the sale of the
steel company in 1977, when the company had a string of five years
of financial losses.
   Navistar attorney Philip Beck said in his opening argument that
Wisconsin's steel demise was the result of ``a combination of
external factors,'' including a six-month strike against Navistar,
a Wisconsin steel customer, immediately before the mill collapsed
in 1980, and the effects of two successive harsh winters.
   And he denied that Navistar, known as International Harvester
Co. in 1977, intended to dupe Envirodyne in the sale _ for which it
lent Envirodyne $50 million of the $65 million acquisition price.
   Rather, Beck said, the sale was part of Navistar's move out of
the steel business in order to concentrate on its core
farm-equipment and truck-manufacturing businesses.
   But pension-insurer attorney William O. Bittman said company
officials ignored recommendations from their investment bankers,
Lehman Bros., that the sale was financially questionable because
Envirodyne lacked the experience and funds to turn the steel
company around.
   He said company officials were aware at the time that the deal
might lead to lawsuits if the steel company went bankrupt, but went
ahead with the sale to Envirodyne in order to avoid $167 million in
losses it faced by liquidating Wisconsin Steel.
   ``I think Navistar sold Wisconsin Steel to a buyer that they
knew did not have the experience or the financial wherewithal to
run the steel division in an economic way,'' Bittman said in an
interview Thursday.
   Navistar has already reached a $14.8 million out-of-court
settlement with 2,700 former employees of the steel company.
   The case adjourned late Thursday until Monday.

<HEAD>Skilled Trades Workers Reject Chrysler Pact; Leaders Meeting in
Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. skilled trades workers rejected a
United Auto Workers contract that was ratified despite their vote,
and union officials scheduled a meeting to determine the reason for
the rejection.
   The two-year contract, covering 66,000 hourly and salaried
workers, was ratified Wednesday by 54 percent of those voting. But
skilled trades workers, more than 10,500 of Chrysler's UAW
employees, voted against ratification.
   The skilled trades rejection has no effect on the overall
ratification, but could lead to new negotiations solely on skilled
trades issues.
   The problem is that skilled trades workers, like salaried
workers, are covered both by the main contract and by a separate
pact the deals only with skilled trades issues, such as
apprenticeships.
   Skilled trades and salaried workers cast one vote each that
covers both pacts.
   So at a meeting in Chicago today called by UAW President Owen
Bieber and UAW Vice President Marc Stepp, union leaders must
determine whether the skilled trades' rejection was based on issues
in the main pact, such as economics, or issues in their separate
contract.
   ``The agreement has been accepted'' despite the skilled trades
rejection, ``and we are going to review the skilled trades
situation according to our procedures,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce
said Thursday.
   If the rejection was based on issues contained in the main
contract, then neither new negotiations nor a new skilled trades
vote will occur, union sources said.
   Union officials who asked not to be identified said they
believed the rejection was economic. That means the meeting would
be the only action on the rejection and skilled trades workers will
have to live with the contract.
   The meeting includes those delegates on the UAW's 140-member
national Chrysler council who represent skilled trades workers.
There is at least one skilled trades delegate for each of
Chrysler's nearly 50 UAW local unions.

<TEXT>
   A state official said 900 workers will
be laid off from the General Electric ordnance systems plant here
over the next 18 months because of cutbacks in defense contracts.
   But a company executive, Defense Systems Division Vice President
Arthur Glenn, said GE has not yet decided how many workers will be
laid off or when, although he predicted ``a significant number'' of
layoffs was coming because of forecasts of a troubled future.
   ``The market we serve we thought, up to a year ago, to be at
least on a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis,'' said
Glenn, blaming the sudden turnaround on anticipated government
cutbacks.
   ``As pressure gets tough on defense budgets, government
customers have to make difficult decisions,'' he said at a news
conference in a GE building.
   A Dukakis administration official who asked not to be identified
said GE executives had told the state 900 workers would be fired
beginning in July because of an expected decrease in
defense-related orders.
   The surprise announcement by the largest employer in this city
of 52,000 people came only three months after GE had promised
stable employment at the Pittsfield businesses this year.
   The company had laid off more than 1,000 workers last year when
it closed its transformer plant because of losses in the highly
competitive market.
   The ordnance systems division, which employs 4,700 of the 6,700
employees at the GE operations in Pittsfield, makes guidance
systems for Trident II ballistic missiles systems, components of
the Bradley fighting machine, which carries infantrymen, various
high-speed guns and other military products.
   Neither managers nor union officials answered their telephones
Thursday afternoon.
   GE employs the same number of workers in its Pittsfield defense
systems and plastics plants as it did in 1983, when the company
began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1,400 new
employees. It announced the shutdown of the transformer
manufacturing plant in November 1986 after months of rumors about
the closing.

<HEAD>Computer `Viruses' are Modern-Day Equivalent of Black Cats,
Programmers Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also ran on general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black cats, ladders and cracked mirrors
move over. The Friday-the-13th superstition of the 1980s is
computer viruses, say some computer experts.
   Computer viruses are devious programs created by computer
whizzes that ``infect'' the computer's hardware and reproduce
themselves onto other software. Once confined to flashing a
harmless message on private terminals, they have been known to
erase sensitive files.
   Yet some programmers say they don't believe in computer viruses.
   ``I'm not that superstitious and I really don't see any problems
_ knock on wood,'' said Jim Gogan, research and development
director at the Microcomputing Support Center for the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``We are about as secure as things
can get.''
   ``Viruses are like the bogyman,'' said Byron C. Howes, a
computer systems manager at the UNC Educational Computing Service.
   He compared programmers who believe in them to ``people who set
little bowls of milk outside our doors to feed the dwarfs.''
   According to published reports, viruses have infected computers
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, IBM, the U.S.
House of Representatives, universities and computer networks in
businesses overseas.
   Last year, hundreds of computers in Israel were hit with a
``time bomb'' virus designed to activate today. The virus, which
was detected and believed to have been wiped out, would have spread
and destroyed all data in any computer it had infected.
   ``I just think that the whole thing is a joke,'' said Barry B.
Cooper, owner of Commercial Software in Raleigh.
   Virus rumors, he said, were like the prediction by medieval seer
Nostradamus of a major earthquake on May 8, 1988.
   ``That didn't come true, and this won't come true,'' he said.
   He and others said they were unconcerned because they inspect
new software before using it. Some programmers have ``vaccine''
programs that alert them to someone trying to break into the system
or other tampering, Cooper said.

Styrofoam building insulation by next year, a spokesman said today.
   Dow will substitute non-fully halogenated CFCs for the fully
halogenated CFCs linked in studies with damage to the world's ozone
layer, spokesman Steve Reiher said.
   The ozone layer of the atmosphere, about 15 miles above the
ground, helps protect the Earth from harmful rays of the sun.
   The fully halogenated CFCs also are used in some Dow packaging
and industrial foams, and substitutes also will be sought for the
manufacture of those materials, Reiher said.
   ``We don't have a substitute that is as far along as we do in
the Styrofoam, so we can't give a timetable,'' Reiher said. But he
added that the company is giving top priority to finding
alternatives.
   Styrofoam is a brand name for Dow's blue sheet insulation for
buildings, and though the name often is used for other products
such as plastic foam cups or food packaging, Dow does not
manufacture those, he said.
   Dow purchases the CFCs used in its insulation and other products
from various producers, Reiher said.
   ``So we are also depending on DuPont and Pennwalt and the other
CFC producers to come up with and produce these alternatives,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Wall Street Bulls Say Inflation Fears Overdone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many analysts who are bullish on the
stock-market outlook right now base their optimism on a common
central theme _ that their peers are wrong about inflation.
   Fears of a resurgence of inflation have been spreading in the
financial world since early this year, when it become apparent that
the economy was not slowing significantly in the wake of the stock
market crash last fall.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has
spoken of the need to be watchful for signs of revived upward
pressures on prices.
   Bond traders have registered their uneasiness by pushing the
yield on long-term Treasury bonds up from about 8\ percent to
nearly 9\ percent over the past several weeks.
   One of the big concerns is that economic growth may soon strain
the capacity both of production facilities and the available supply
of workers, so that businesses' costs will start to rise at an
accelerating pace.
   Those worries intensified when the Labor Department reported
that the unemployment rate fell to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in
April.
   Hardly anybody is talking about a return to the double-digit
annual increases in the cost of living that bedeviled the economy
in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Even a moderate increase in inflation, however, could create big
problems for stocks by prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten
credit and interest rates to rise in the credit markets.
   That, in turn, could pose the threat of an eventual recession
and prompt investors to shun stocks in favor of alternatives such
as interest-bearing money market investments.
   The problem with this by-now-familiar refrain, says Charles
LaLoggia, a Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser, is that it is out
of tune with other trends taking place in the financial world.
   Commodity prices are not rising sharply. Gold, which LaLoggia
describes as ``the financial market equivalent of an inflation
weather vane,'' has been going nowhere lately.
   In addition, Laloggia believes tax reform will work as a
counter-inflationary force with its removal of such things as the
incentive for consumers to spend using borrowed money.
   ``I seriously doubt that inflation will reach levels sufficient
to touch off a major rise in interest rates,'' he concludes.
   Argues John Rutledge, a Claremont, Calif., economist, ``The
research we have done suggests that the tight-capacity argument for
inflation is a yawner.
   ``For example, in last year's labor market, wages in the tight
capacity sectors of the economy _ paper, chemicals and steel _ rose
LESS than average wage rates.
   ``It seems that there is still a sizable army of workers who
lost their jobs to restructuring over the past five years but still
want to work at current wage rates.''
   If inflation is indeed sneaking up on the economy, most analysts
agree it would spell trouble for both the stock and bond markets.
   There might have been times in the past, observers acknowledge,
when a little bit of inflation was no problem, or maybe even a
plus, for stocks.
   But these days, they say, ``real'' interest rates _ in other
words, nominal interest rates as compared to the inflation rate _
remain at stubbornly high levels, and the bond market is
hypersensitive to any change in the inflation outlook.
   If interest rates move up from their current levels, they could
quickly put a damper on both the stock market and the economy.
   This same hypersensitivity suggests, however, that if inflation
fears prove to be unfounded, interest rates could fall
substantially.
   ``One of the surest ways to make money in the financial markets
is to identify a consensus and to bet against it,'' LaLoggia
maintains. ``And right now we have a beauty of a consensus which I
believe will turn out to be incorrect.''

   The stock market staged a broad rally today,
inspired by falling interest rates and a steady dollar in foreign
exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.76 to 1,982.76
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 7 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 743 up, 207
down and 440 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 36.95 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   As the dollar strengthened against leading foreign currencies,
prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value in the credit markets.
   Analysts said investors around the world were encouraged by the
successful completion late Thursday of the Treasury's three-day
auction of $26 billion in bonds and notes.
   Brokers also noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in
the Labor Department's report this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent last month.
   In addition, Japan reported a continued narrowing of its
international trade surplus. The Commerce Department is due to
report next week on the latest monthly U.S. trade balance.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &
Telegraph, up \ at 27|; Exxon, up { at 44{; General Electric, up ]
at 39], and Ford Motor, up | at 47~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed .94 to 144.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .43 at 297.04.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 2.15
points to 1,968.00.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 778 up, 628 down and 530 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 143.88 million shares, down from 176.72 million in the

<HEAD>Newspaper: Sunbelt Savings Association Indicates $1.2 Billion Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas apparently
posted a $1.2 billion net loss last quarter, leaving regulators to
face what could be the most expensive bailout in savings and loan
history, a published report said today.
   The loss, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, would be
among the largest quarterly shortfalls ever for a thrift, and
leaves Sunbelt with negative regulatory capital, a lenient measure
of net worth, of almost $1.7 billion, the Wall Street Journal
reported in Friday editions.
   The cost of closing Sunbelt could rival last November's record
$1.3 billion bailout of Vernon Savings & Loan Association, another
Texas thrift. Regulators have speculated that Sunbelt, however,
could be merged with other troubled Texas thrifts and recapitalized
with a combination of private capital and federal assistance.
   The ``Southwest Plan,'' a blueprint developed by federal
regulators for rebuilding Texas' ailing thrift industry, was
expected to be announced this week. The strategy calls for
combining healthy institutions with about 140 ailing Texas thrifts,
including 104 declared insolvent.
   On Wednesday, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that the
thrifts had capital losses of $3.3 billion in the quarter ended
March 31, including the $2.4 billion loss in March. Regulators said
one Texas thrift caused much of the hit to capital, but they
refused to identify the thrift.
   Thomas J. Wageman, Sunbelt's chairman and chief executive
officer, told the Wall Street Journal the thrift is closely held
and does not report its numbers publicly.
   Wageman's secretary told The Associated Press he was not
available for further comment. FHLB-Dallas officials did not
immediately return the AP's calls.
   Wageman told the Journal new accounting rules imposed by federal
regulators have hurt all savings and loans because the thrifts are
less flexible in deferring possible losses on foreclosed property.
   ``From the point of view of balance sheets, it's a revolution in
the industry,'' he said.
   Experts, though, said the new accounting rules don't fully
explain Sunbelt's loss, and cited declining Texas real estate
values as a factor.
   For the nine months ended Dec. 31, Sunbelt had a net loss of
$406.2 million, giving the thrift an indicated loss for the year of
about $1.6 billion. Sunbelt had $3.3 billion in assets as of Dec.
31.
   Wageman, a former banker who came to Sunbelt in 1986, has been a
critic of Texas savings and loan lending practices. He was
installed at Sunbelt after H. Joe Selby, a former federal bank
regulator who had worked with him, took over thrift supervision at
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.
   Sunbelt, meanwhile, lost a $62.9 million-plus suit filed by one
of the thrift's borrowers after Sunbelt foreclosed on the
borrower's real estate loans, Dallas County court records show.
   A Dallas jury decided the case Tuesday against Sunbelt, but the
court has not issued a formal judgment and neither the developers,
the lenders, nor either side's attorneys would comment about the
case.
   The amount of damages will be decided by a state district judge
after a hearing.
   T.F. Stone-Liberty Land Associates, the former owners of the
Liberty Plaza II office buildings and 42 acres of land in north
Dallas, said in their lawsuit that Sunbelt wrongfully foreclosed
the properties in August 1987.
   The partnership, led by Tommy F. Stone, said in its suit that
Sunbelt used its financial leverage to force the partnership into
unwanted deals, then foreclosed to acquire the property.
   The suit asked for the return of the foreclosed building and
land, cancellation of the loans, and up to $62.9 million in damages.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale costs rose a moderate 0.4 percent in April, while
business sales and inventories moved in opposite directions in the
previous month, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said the steepest energy price gain in 15
months pushed wholesale costs upward, while food prices were
modestly higher.
   If the April increase held for 12 straight months, inflation at
the wholesale level would register an annual increase of 4.6
percent, more than double the 2.2 percent 1987 wholesale price rise.
   The April increase, coming after a 0.6 percent gain in March,
the sharpest rise in almost a year, seems certain to add to
concerns that inflation is reheating.
   But the combination of booming sales and a slowdown in the
buildup of inventories was considered good news for the economy,
pointing to expected increases in production in the months ahead.
   The Commerce Department said business sales shot up 1.9 percent
in March, the biggest advance in more than a year, while business
inventories rose 0.3 percent, the smallest gain in seven months.
   Separately on Thursday, an early Easter, bad weather and a
bigger federal tax bite for some people combined to push retail
sales down 0.6 percent in April, but economists were unfazed by the
decline, which was the first setback in six months.
   In other economic news, the stock market was little changed and
bond prices edged slightly lower amid increasing inflation worries.
   The Commerce Department reported that consumers spent a
seasonally adjusted $131.6 billion at retail stores last month, a
drop of $815 million from the revised March figure.
   Sales had not fallen since a 0.8 percent setback last October,
but economists said they were not particularly concerned by the
weakness, especially because sales in March were revised upward to
show an increase of 1.7 percent. The March rise was the fastest
sales advance since last August and almost twice the originally
estimated 0.8 percent gain for the month.
   Retail sales are regarded as an important indicator of economic
activity, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the
gross national product.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
37.80 on Wednesday, recovered 2.15 points to 1,968.00 in light
trading.
   Brokers said traders continued to be concerned that persistent
strength in the economy would lead to upward pressure on interest
rates and inflation.
   In the credit markets, the price of the government's 30-year
issue fell, pushing its yield to 9.22 percent from 9.20 percent
late Wednesday. Those yields are the highest since mid-December.
   Separately, the dollar finished slightly lower against most
major currencies in dull domestic dealings; oil prices edged
slightly lower and soybean futures closed sharply lower after a
five-day rally.

   Most grain and soybean futures opened slightly
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade as slack export demand
and forecasts for weekend rains lent a bearish tone to the markets.
   Weather continues to be the dominant market factor as the winter
wheat crop nears maturity and the growing season begins in earnest
for corn and soybeans.
   Market analysts predicted a fairly quiet session, citing
traders' reluctance to go out on a limb by establishing new
positions before the weekend.
   ``Just because of uncertainty about the weather forecast, I
think people will stand aside and then pick it up again after the
weekend,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to { cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.01 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1 cent lower with May at $1.96 a bushel; oats were \ cent lower
to { cent higher with May at $1.55 a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 3 cents lower with May at $7.04 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
to lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .50 cent higher with June at 73.57

   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday.

   Five van-loads of Girl Scout cookies finally got
past Japanese customs inspectors and into the hands of the U.S.
Navy Friday after a persistent Brownie troop resorted to diplomacy
to get their shipment delivered.
   The cookies arrived at the New Tokyo International Airport at
Narita and were taken by vans to the Atsugi Naval Air Station to be
forwarded to sailors aboard the USS Midway.
   Brownie troop 807 in Beeville, Texas, sold 402 boxes of cookies
to the crew of the Midway, with free shipment provided by American
Airlines.
   However, the plan crumbled when Japanese customs officials said
they would have to levy a $2,000 duty on the cookies. The cookies
were returned to Texas.
   Senator Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, stepped in and went through
diplomatic channels to clear up the matter, and the Japanese agreed
to let the cookies into the country as long as they were not sold
locally.

   Citing possible safety problems, federal
regulators have ordered 38 nuclear power plants to inspect and, if
necessary, replace piping materials for which the supplier
allegedly falsified test reports.
   Some of the suspect flanges and fittings are used in
safety-related systems, whose failure could thwart the shutdown of
a reactor in an emergency, said Edward Baker, a section chief in
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Reactor Regulation.
   ``The fact that (the plants) are listed doesn't necessarily mean
that the materials are not good. What it means is because of facts
we have found, the materials are suspect,'' Baker said by telephone
Thursday from Bethesda, Md.
   Baker said inspecting and replacing the suspect materials could
pose some difficulty for operating plants, where the materials
could be in high-radiation areas. Plants generally must complete
the inspections and make replacements during their next refueling
outages.
   In a bulletin sent to the plants this week, the NRC said the
suspect piping came from Piping Supplies Inc. of Folsom, N.J., and
West Jersey Manufacturing Co. of Williamstown, N.J. Piping supplied
since 1976 is covered by the bulletin.
   West Jersey and Piping Supplies claimed in test reports that the
piping met standards set by the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, but in many cases could not provide supporting
documentation, Baker said. Some piping material was traced to a
foreign company, which required additional tests that were not
done, he said.
   A man with ties to both companies, Joseph Walker Sr., today
denied that Piping Supplies falsified any information, but
acknowledged that West Jersey's reports were falsified. He said he
brought that information to the NRC's attention.
   ``At no time did Piping Supplies knowingly use false information
about materials supplied to the nuclear industry,'' the company
said this week in a letter to NRC officials and nuclear plant
quality assurance managers.
   ``The documents that the bulletin is referring to were obtained
from West Jersey Manufacturing as a result of (voluntary
disclosure). None of this material was purchased by Piping
Supplies.''
   Walker, who was West Jersey's president, said West Jersey closed
in December 1986 after he and other top officials were indicted on
mail fraud and tax fraud charges. Walker said his son, Joseph
Walker Jr., helped open Piping Supplies the following month.
   The senior Walker said he pleaded guilty to the charges, paid
more than $400,000 in fines and served probation. He said the
indictments were among at least 200 handed down nationwide in
investigations of widespread commercial kickbacks in the power
piping industry.

<HEAD>Posts 63 Percent Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atari Corp., the computer and video
game manufacturer, said Friday its earnings fell 63 percent for its
first fiscal quarter because of losses at a chain of retail outlets
it acquired last fall.
   The company said sales of its computer and video games were
strong.
   Atari reported a profit of $5.7 million, or 10 cents a share,
for the three months ended April 2 compared with earnings of $15.3
million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The 1987 results included from $5.9 million in accumulated tax
credits.
   Revenue for the quarter soared to $169.2 million this year from
$65.1 million a year earlier.
   Atari said its retail chain, Federated Group Inc., which
operates 68 consumer electronic stores in California, Texas,
Arizona and New Mexico, had an operating loss before taxes of $9.6
million in the quarter.
   Atari bought Federated last October for $64 million.
   Sam Tramiel, preident of Atari, said the unit is approaching
breakeven and said he foresees a small loss or small profit in the
second and third quarters and a modest profit in the fourth quarter.
   ``Further action is being taken to reduce costs, improve product
mix and margin and to increase sales,'' he said.
   Excluding results from Federated, Atari said it would have had
earnings of $15.2 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $15.3
million, or 26 cents a share, in the same period in 1987.
   Its sales for the quarter, excluding Federated, rose to $97.7
million from $65.1 million.

<HEAD>U.S. Joins Whistleblower's Suit Alleging Overcharging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has joined in a lawsuit
alleging that McDonnell Douglas Corp. overcharged the Army by up to
$175 million for the Apache attack helicopter.
   A company spokesman on Friday denied any wrongdoing.
   The decision by the U.S. Justice Department to join an updated
version of the suit filed by whistleblower Rod Stillwell was
contained in a U.S. District Court filing April 28, but never
formally announced.
   The department had previously joined Stillwell in accusing the
defense contractor of $1.1 million in overcharges on one
subcontract for the Apache, which is the Army's newest anti-tank
and anti-armor attack helicopter.
   The latest filing in the year-old suit means the government also
supports new allegations by Stillwell that the company engaged in a
pattern of overcharging on the program.
   The company hasn't been served with the latest legal paperwork,
but denies there was any overcharging, said Jim Ramsey, spokesman
for McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., a subsidiary with
headquarters in Mesa, Ariz.
   ``We continue to believe the allegations in the case are without
merit and we continue to cooperate with the government in a review
of these matters,'' Ramsey said Friday.
   Stillwell first made his allegations in 1984, when he was a
subcontracts administrator at Hughes Helicopters Inc., which has
since been bought by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. He filed
the original suit in March 1987.
   The suit was brought under the U.S. False Claims Act, which
allows a court to award the government treble damages. Depending on
which legal theory is applied, that could amount to between $500
million and $750 million, the suit says.
   Under the act, which is intended to encourage employees to point
out fraud, Stillwell could get up to 25 percent of any damages
awarded.
   Stillwell's attorney, William Ramsey, alleged that the
overcharges represented an effort by the company to ``buy into''
the Apache program by keeping costs artificially low early in the
program.
   ``They figured they could make it back later on,'' said Ramsey,
no relation to the McDonnell Douglas spokesman.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Up 9.5 Points</HEAD>

   Share prices rose on the London Stock Exchange
Friday, spurred by new buying on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 9.5
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,781.8.
   Volume was a modest 372.9 million shares, compared with
Thursday's 340.8 million shares.
   Dealers said the market was encouraged by Wall Street's strong
start and Tokyo's better finish Friday. By the end of the London
session, the Dow Jones industrial average was more than 20 points
higher.
   In addition, several equity analysts said the market seems to be
on a sound technical footing and looked fundamentally healthy.
Share prices have shown ``remarkably good resilience'' since
Wednesday's 35.8-point drop, one dealer said.
   ``The sentiment is such that the market doesn't want to rush
ahead too terribly fast, nor give up its recent gains,'' he said.
   Fears of rising interest rates that were prevalent in the market
earlier in the week have dissipated, one analyst said.
   Institutional buyers were spotted in the market Friday, helping
to boost sentiment and encourage other players to step in off the
sidelines.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed at 1,428.6, up 11
points.
   The Financial Times 500-share index rose 6.63 points to close at
1,010.23.

<HEAD>Atlanta Banks Respond To Race Bias Charges With Loan Pool</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlanta's banking community, acting to counter
reports of racial bias in its lending practices, on Friday
announced a series of programs to provide $65 million in
low-interest, low-cost loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers
on the city's predominantly black south side.
   Although denying that racial bias has played a part in lending
decisions, D. Raymond Riddle, president of First Atlanta Corp.,
said, ``In (racial) matters, Atlanta is like Caesar's wife, it must
be above suspicion.''
   Also, one of the organizers said he hoped the programs will
forestall federal investigators.
   U.S. Justice Department officials have said they will look into
the allegations of racial bias, but James C. Mynatt, spokesman for
the newly created loan pool, said he hoped an investigation would
not now be needed.
   Bankers said the loan project, which includes subsidies for
police officers to live in the target neighborhoods, is the first
of its kind in the nation.
   Included in the programs are promises to extend banking hours in
the targeted neighborhoods and to aggressively market the
availability of the money.
   The decisions, some of which bankers said had been in the works
for about a year, were applauded by Atlanta politicians who had
been angered by newspaper reports suggesting area lending
institutions included racial considerations in making loan
decisions.
   Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax, who is black,
praised the nine banks and savings and loans that ``stepped forward
aggressively and met the challenge that the problem has provided to
the community.
   ``This is the Atlanta tradition at work: black and white, public
and private. This problem has been transformed into an opportunity.
What's been done here today is an important first step,'' said
Lomax, whose own problems getting a home improvement loan were
detailed in news articles.
   The reports in The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution
indicated that white neighborhoods receive five times as many home
loans as black neighborhoods with the same income level.
   ``Race relations in our city not only set the standard for the
South, but for the United States, and the entire free world,''
Riddle said at a news conference announcing the lending programs.
   ``And indeed the banks here have set standards that are
worldwide standards in race relations, as well as industry
standards in profitability and soundness,'' he said.
   The programs include:
   _A $20 million loan pool from nine banks and savings
institutions, with low interest rates in targeted working-class
neighborhoods. The pool will be managed by the newly created
Atlanta Mortgage Consortium.
   The pool would make 30-year, fixed-rate loans for 97 percent of
appraised value, with no private mortgage insurance required.
Interest rates would be from half a point to 1{ points below market
rates, with no discount points charged.
   _A $25 million commitment for low-interest loans from Citizens
and Southern National Bank to include $10 million for home-purchase
loans and $15 million for home-improvement loans, at low interest
rates and low closing costs, to families with incomes of $35,000 or
less.
   _A $10 million commitment for low-interest loans from First
National Bank of Atlanta at low interest rates and low closing
costs, for home-purchase and home-improvement loans to families
with incomes of $30,000 or less in specific working-class
neighborhoods.
   _A similar $10 million program from Trust Company Bank, which
also is making the largest commitment to the loan pool.
   The programs include lower loan costs and more flexible
qualifying procedures.
   Bankers said they would work with attorneys and others involved
in the loan process to attempt to hold down those costs as well, to
make entry into the market easier.
   In addition, First Atlanta and C&S each announced plans to set
aside up to $15,000 a year for the ext five years to help subsidize
housing costs for police officers who choose to live in specified
areas. Joe Patterson, a spokesman for First Atlanta, said the banks
would adopt specific neighborhoods and pay up to $200 per month to
encourage police officers and their families to live in the areas.
   The consortium will consider a similar program, Mynatt said.
   Other participating lenders include Bank South N.A., Citizens
Trust Bank, First American Bank of Georgia, First Union National
Bank of Georgia, Fulton Federal Savings and Loan Association and
Georgia Federal Bank.
   The banks will begin taking applications for the new loans May
21.

   A coalition of consumer-interest groups is
calling on the public to nominate the year's worst advertising.
   Each year the groups issue what they call the ``Hubbard''
trophies, an effort to draw attention to advertising they consider
misleading or irresponsible.
   The fourth annual Hubbard trophy ceremonies will be held next
month, and the organizers are calling on the public to send in
nominations. The deadline is June 10.
   Ads from newspapers or magazines, and tapes or detailed
descriptions of broadcast ads, can be sent to Hubbard Awards, 1501
16th St., N.W., Washington, D.C., 20036.
   The trophies are named for Harlan Page Hubbard, a 19th century
advertising pioneer who designed campaigns for snake oils and
patent medicines.
   Coordinating the event is the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   Other participating groups include the American Association of
Retired Persons, Consumer Affairs Committee of Americans for
Democratic Action, Aviation Consumer Action Project, Center for
Auto Safety, Coalition on Smoking or Health, Consumer Federation of
America, National Consumer's League, National Council on
Alcoholism, National Women's Health Network and the Safe Energy
Communications Council.

   Soybean futures prices skyrocketed Friday and
grain futures also closed higher after the National Weather Service
predicted a month of drier-than-normal growing conditions.
   Soybean futures, which have risen sharply during the past week,
leaped as much as 14{ cents a bushel and set new contract highs
across the board.
   Large speculative firms such as Refco Inc. and C&D Commodities
led the trade, analysts said.
   The National Weather Service said in its 30-day outlook that the
Ohio River valley, central Mississippi River valley and the
Mississippi Delta region would all be drier than normal.
   ``They were using that forecast as an excuse to rally the
(soybean) market,'' said Jon Horton, an analyst at Research
Department Inc. in Chicago. ``It's still a bull market, so
everyone's back in it on the long side.''
   The soybean market is particularly sensitive to weather concerns
because of indications that the U.S. stockpile is dwindling and a
large crop is needed to meet expected demand.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 4} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.06 a bushel; corn was } cent to

<TEXT>
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. said its shareholders plan
to sell 22 percent of their stock to the public for $18 a share,
cheaper than originally planned.
   The sale to the public of shares in Sotheby's, the world's
largest art auctioneer, was supposed to have taken place last year
but was postponed after the collapse of world stock markets on Oct.
19.
   Sotheby's has been controlled by U.S. property developer Alfred
Taubman since 1983.
   Initially, Sotheby's said it would sell 7.2 million shares, with
limited voting rights, for between $23 and $26 a share. It later
said it would sell 5.5 million shares at $18 to $21 each.
   The sale of 5.5 million shares at $18 each is expected to raise
a total of $99 million.
   The company said 2.9 million shares are being offered in New
York and 1.5 million are being sold in London, simultaneously at an
undetermined date. The remaining 1.1 million shares will be sold on
the international market at another time.
   The newly issued shares carry one vote each, while the shares
retained by the current holders are entitled to 10 votes each. As a
result, the current shareholders will retain 97 percent of the
voting rights, but the new ones will be entitled to elect 25
percent of the board of directors.

<HEAD>Incentives Boost Domestic Car and Truck Sales 35.2 Percent in
Early May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rush to beat widespread buyer-incentive
deadlines boosted sales of domestic-made car and light trucks 35.2
percent in early May compared with a year ago, industry analysts
said Friday.
   Automakers sold 204,270 domestic-made cars and light trucks in
the eight-selling days from May 1-10, up from 151,131 in the
identical period a year ago, the companies reported.
   Last year, the incentives expired in April, depressing sales in
early May, said David Healy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert in
New York.
   ``Sales at the end of an incentive period are always exaggerated
because of the rush to buy'' encouraged by heavy dealer and
automaker advertising, said Chris Cedergren, analyst with J.D.
Power and Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   General Motors Corp., the industry leader, sold 35.1 percent
more cars and light trucks, while No. 3 Chrysler Corp. sales jumped
48.6 percent from the low performance of a year ago.
   Chrysler's sales rose on most vehicles, but particular
improvements included a 72 percent increase in Jeep sales from
sales by American Motors Corp. a year ago and a 55 percent increase
in minivan sales.
   Chrysler held 57 percent of the minivan market in April, said
Chrysler spokesman Baron Bates.
   Bates and Chrysler's director of sales operations planning,
Steve Torok, attributed the increase in Jeep sales to increased
production and greater consumer confidence in Jeep since Chrysler
bought AMC in August.
   For Ford Motor Co., the No. 2 maker, combined car and truck
sales were up 31.5 percent and set a company record for the period.
Ford's truck sales also passed GM's and set a separate company
record for the period, said Ray Windecker, a Ford company analyst.
   The Big Three extended their incentive programs after May 11 but
reduced the numbers of models covered in some cases and cut the
size of rebates on many vehicles because inventories of unsold
vehicles have been cleared out.
   ``Incentives are a way of life at the moment. The only question
are they big ones or small ones,'' Healy said.
   GM's domestic-made car sales rose 36.4 percent, Ford's were up
30.5 percent and Chrysler's rose 44.8 percent from a year ago. GM
light truck sales increased 32.1 percent, Ford's rose 32.9 percent
and Chrysler's jumped 53.1 percent.
   Nissan Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. all also reported increased sales of U.S.-made cars
and, for Nissan, light trucks.
   Volkswagen of America Inc., which is closing its Westmoreland,
Pa., factory in July, has begun phasing down production there,
leading to a decline in its domestic-car sales.
   Automakers have boosted their 1988 industry forecasts from
rather pessimistic projections issued in the fall after the Oct. 19
stock market crash. Ford, for example, has increased its industry
forecast from 15 million cars and trucks, imported and domestic, to
15.3 million.
   But Cedergren predicted sales will slow during the second half
of the year and said Big Three production plans show a similar
expectation by the companies.
   ``The manufacturers are not assuming that sales are going to
stay at the same high rate as they were the first quarter,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Boeing Called Big Winner In $4 Billion Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. is being called the big winner in
an order for more than $4 billion worth of aircraft, and industry
analysts say they aren't surprised.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, reported
Friday that International Lease Finance Corp. is expected to
announce Monday that Boeing has won 80 percent of the order for up
to 120 planes, and that the European consortium Airbus Industrie
will get the rest.
   ILFC Vice President Kenneth Taylor said in a telephone interview
today that he knew news of a decision had leaked out, but he said
no formal announcement would be made by the company until Monday
morning.
   He said company President Steven Udvar-Hazy was in Seattle to
pick up a previously ordered 747 at Boeing's Everett plant _ the
company's fourth.
   ILFC, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., recently announced it
intended to buy as many as 120 planes, including options, in a
combination of medium- and long-range aircraft. The company's board
reportedly met Tuesday to decide which companies would get the
order.
   Tom Cole, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle,
said the company didn't have details of the order yet and wouldn't
say anything until International does. David Venz, Airbus U.S.
spokesman in Herndon, Va., said the same thing.
   But Judith Comeau of Goldman, Sachs in New York said Friday that
suppliers had received the orders already.
   ``I don't know why they're waiting so long'' to announce it, she
said of International Lease.
   Ms. Comeau said she was quite sure four companies would get a
piece of the action _ Boeing and Airbus for the aircraft, and
General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for engines _ and that she
wouldn't be surprised if Boeing got most of it.
   ``According to International Lease Finance, they wanted a full
range of aircraft, including the 747,'' she said. ``No other
aircraft can take that many passengers. In terms of volume, Boeing
obviously has the largest capacity and would be in a better
position to bid this contract.
   ``Also, International Finance Corp. leases its aircraft to
airlines, and it's easier to maintain aircraft with some
commonality. Boeing already has a large share of the market.''
   George Shapiro of Salomon Bros. in New York agreed.
   ``I've kind of expected Boeing would be the winner,'' he said.
``If you're leasing airplanes to airliners ... you're best off
using the most known and most familiar. Boeing has a dominant
market share.''
   A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. told the
Wall Street Journal that the company never seriously considered
itself a candidate for the order.
   The planes would meet ILFC's fleet needs between 1991 and 1995,
Udvar-Hazy has said. The company's biggest previous order was last
year's 19-plane purchase of several Boeing models worth $1.15
billion.
   Udvar-Hazy earlier indicated the coming order would be for
all-Boeing aircraft or a combination of Airbus or McDonnell Douglas
aircraft. But he said Thursday that the order had been changed to
mix sources.
   The largest aircraft order to date is thought to be British
Airways' $2.3 billion purchase of 16 Boeing 747s in 1986, which
would have a value of $4.1 billion if 12 options for other jumbo
jets are exercised.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
inspired by falling interest rates and a steady dollar in foreign
exchange.
   As the dollar strengthened against leading foreign currencies,
prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value in the credit markets.
   Analysts said investors around the world were encouraged by the
successful completion late Thursday of the Treasury's three-day
auction of $26 billion in bonds and notes.
   Brokers also noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in
the Labor Department's report this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent last month.
   In addition, Japan reported a continued narrowing of its
international trade surplus. The Commerce Department is due to
report next week on the latest monthly U.S. trade balance.

   The stock market recouped some of its recent
losses with a broad rally Friday, aided by declining interest rates
and a steady dollar in foreign exchange.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.55 to
1,990.55, cutting its loss for the week to 16.91 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,076 up, 446 down and 462 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 147.24 million
shares, against 143.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades at
regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled
166.48 million shares.
   As the dollar strengthened against leading foreign currencies,
prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value in the credit markets, putting their yields in
the 9.1 percent to 9.2 percent range.
   Analysts said investors around the world were encouraged by the
successful completion late Thursday of the Treasury's three-day
auction of $26 billion in bonds and notes.
   Brokers also noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in
the Labor Department's report Friday morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 0.4 percent last month.
   In addition, Japan reported a continued narrowing of its
international trade surplus. The Commerce Department is due to
report next week on the latest monthly U.S. trade balance.
   Though the news background was generally favorable, however,
analysts said the market was still listless. Most of Friday's gains
came early in the session, and from midday on prices drifted in a
narrow range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up 1 at 45; General
Electric, up ] at 39]; International Business Machines, up 1| at
110], and Ford Motor, up } at 48.
   Tobacco issues lost ground, with Philip Morris down 1] at 84 and
RJR Nabisco down } at 45}. On Monday, Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop is expected to issue a report describing smoking of tobacco
products as a form of drug addiction.
   Niagara Mohawk Power led the active list, up [ at 14| on
turnover of more than 25.7 million shares. Most of the activity in
the stock was attributed to strategies pegged to the company's
impending quarterly dividend.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $25.74 billion, or
1.77 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.52 to 145.30.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 3.52 to 298.23, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.93 at 256.78.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.25 to 372.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.94, up 1.33.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Skyrocket On Dry Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices skyrocketed Friday and grain futures also
advanced after the National Weather Service predicted a month of
drier-than-normal growing conditions.
   On other markets, precious metals were higher; cattle futures
rose while pork futures were mixed; energy futures were slightly
higher; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Soybean futures, which had posted strong gains in five of the
six previous sessions, leaped as much as 14 cents a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade and set new contract highs across the board.
   The National Weather Service said in its 30-day outlook that the
Ohio River valley, central Mississippi River valley and the
Mississippi Delta region would all be drier than normal.
   The large speculative firms Refco Inc. and C&D Commodities led
the trading, analysts said.
   ``They were using that forecast as an excuse to rally the
(soybean) market,'' said Jon Horton, an analyst at Research
Department Inc. in Chicago. ``It's still a bull market, so
everyone's back in it on the long side.''
   Some private forecasters also reduced their predictions for rain
over the weekend, said Mickey Luth, soybean analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The soybean market is particularly sensitive to weather concerns
because of indications that the U.S. soybean stockpile is dwindling
and a large crop is needed to meet expected demand.
   Some analysts have called the recent soybean speculation
excessive but Luth questioned that opinion.
   ``Who knows? From an overall balance sheet point-of-view, maybe
the soybeans should have been up here anyway,'' he said.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 4} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.06 a bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ cents
higher with May at $1.97 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2 cents
higher with May at $1.57\ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 14
cents higher with May at $7.19{ a bushel.
   The surge in soybean futures supported expectations for higher
inflation, which helped boost precious metals futures prices,
analysts said.
   Platinum futures led group, which had been flagging in reaction
to a government report issued early Friday that said wholesale
prices had risen a moderate 0.4 percent in April. The
inflation-sensitive metals markets had expected a greater increase.
   ``Better buying emerged late in the session as soybean and some
other markets firmed,'' said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst in
Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That mitigated the effects
of the Producer Price Index for April and tended to fuel
inflationary expectations that have been building recently.''
   Platinum settled $6.70 to $7.20 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with July at $550.30 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $1.50 lower
to 40 cents higher with June at $453.70 a troy ounce; silver was
4.8 cents to 5.8 cents higher with May at $6.632 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures gained due to strong cash prices while pork
futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Advances in the cattle pit were limited by position-evening
ahead of Monday's seven-state cattle-on-feed report, which is
expected to show fewer feedlot placements during April compared to
last year and a nearly equal number of April marketings, analysts
said.
   Support for the hog and pork belly contracts stemmed from
expectations that cash markets will remain firm as hog slaughters
experience a seasonal decline, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in
Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .65 cent higher with June at
73.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .48 cent
higher with May at 80.77 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent lower to
.43 cent higher with June at 53.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent lower to .38 cent higher with May at 54.40
cents a pound.
   Most energy futures prices inched higher in lackluster trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 4
cents higher with June at $17.49 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
to .30 cent higher with June at 47.47 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent lower to .42 cent higher with June at 52.34
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures posted substantial gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 3.75 points higher at 257.55.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Continues To Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus fell to $6.75 billion in
April, the 12th consecutive monthly decline, the Finance Ministry
said Friday.
   The surplus in Japan's worldwide trade during April declined
from $7.54 billion a year ago and from $7.46 billion in March, the
ministry said.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States also continued to
fall, dropping to $4.13 billion in April from $5.13 billion a year
earlier.
   Ministry officials attributed the steady decline mostly to the
rise in value of the yen, which makes Japanese products more
expensive overseas and tends to make imports less costly in Japan.
   ``In the background of this trend is, of course, the yen's
appreciation for more than two years,'' a ministry official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Still, however, surveys show that much of the savings from
cheaper exports has not been passed on to consumers.
   Imports surged 31 percent from the previous year's level to a
record $15.67 billion for the month, while exports rose 15 percent
to $22.42 billion, the ministry said.
   Officials said manufactured goods accounted for a record 49.9
percent of imports in April, surpassing the previous record of 48.8
percent set in February.
   Officials noted an increase in imports of manufactured goods
from newly industrialized Asian countries such as Taiwan and South
Korea, attributing the rise to improved quality and price
competitiveness.
   The reduction in the trade imbalance with the United States was
encouraging to the Japanese government, which has been under
pressure from the United States to reduce its large trade surplus.
   Exports to the United States fell 1.2 percent from the previous
year to $7.34 billion, while imports shot up 39.7 percent to $3.21
billion, the ministry said.
   Imports of a wide range of U.S. products increased. Textile
materials surged 62.1 percent to $67.6 million, while imports of
business machines climbed 51.2 percent to $158.9 million.
Audio-video products shot up 288.1 percent to $15 million, and car
imports accelerated by 325.9 percent to $34.7 million.
   Japanese trade figures are calculated on a customs-clearance
basis, which includes transportation and insurance costs in imports
but not in exports. If the costs were added to both, Japan's trade
surplus would be higher.

<HEAD>British, California Companies Raided In Loan Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint U.S.-British investigation of companies
that allegedly fail to deliver promised loans and reap fees from
their clients prompted raids in Great Britain and California,
authorities said.
   British and U.S. officials said Thursday's raids were among
their largest cooperative campaigns against white-collar crimes in
recent years.
   They said the targets were part of an alleged scheme bilking
clients out of tens of millions of dollars a year by charging fees
to help them get loans that are never made.
   ``It's one of the most successful loan schemes there has been,''
Sgt. Nigel Lane of Scotland Yard told The Boston Globe. ``The whole
fraud is designed to cross boundaries to capitalize on problems of
jurisdiction.''
   The Globe reported six weeks ago that First Boston Charter Corp.
in Boston and other companies around the world allegedly would
promise to help clients get low-cost loans, charge them large fees.
The companies then allegedly passed the applications among
themselves, making new promises and charging more fees.
   The Globe said none of the clients it interviewed got the loan
or recovered the fees paid.
   Shortly after the articles appeared, First Boston Charter was
evicted from its offices in Boston, and the Globe said two
executives of First Boston Charter were seen at one of the
companies raided Thursday in California.
   Thursday's actions began with simultaneous raids in London and
Lincolnshire, about 130 miles north of London.
   Police in Lincolnshire searched offices of United Kingdom Loans
& Insurance Services Ltd. and arrested its top executive, Lawrence
W. Hill, and Scotland Yard officers raided Westminster & London
Investments Ltd. in London and arrested David Morgan.
   Lane said both were arrested on ``suspicion of criminal
deception'' and released.
   Eight hours later, FBI agents raided a suite of offices in
Irvine, Calif., while others raided the offices of Euro-Kredit N.A.
in Newport Beach, Calif.
   The Globe said the suite in Irvine housed three companies: Zuger
Ltd., Charter Federal Ltd., and Mercantile General Corp.
   The newspaper said agents saw Paul J. Gilbert, who had been a
top First Boston Charter executive, and Marc W. Anderson, president
of First Boston Charter, at the Zuger office.

<HEAD>Energy Prices Fueled Moderate Boost in Wholesale Prices in April</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: new throughout to UPDATE with market activity; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in April despite the biggest jump in energy prices in more than 15
months, the government said Friday.
   The April increase in the Producer Price Index was down from a
0.6 percent March advance, leading many analysts to conclude that
worries over inflation had been overstated by the March increase.
   They said if the volatile energy and food sectors were removed,
the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent.
   ``It is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is taking
off based on these kinds of numbers,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc.
   For the first four months of the year, wholesale prices have
risen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, not much changed from the
2.2 percent increase for all of 1987.
   ``The earlier fears that inflation was taking off were
substantially overstated,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist
of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``This report
confirms that most of the price increases we have been getting
recently have been in oil. There is no reason to believe that OPEC
will be able to enforce control over oil markets enough to keep
energy prices rising.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the report
``good news. Producer price inflation remains low.''
   The report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investors
concluded there will be no additional pressure on the Federal
Reserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each
$1,000 in face value to yield 9.17 percent. On Thursday the
bellwether 30-year issue's yield jumped to its highest point this
year at 9.22 percent.
   The Fed recently moved to make credit less available to the
banking system because of fears the economy was overheating. That
tightening prompted the nation's major banks to boost their prime
lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent on Wednesday, the first
increase since last October's stock market crash.
   Other economists, however, insisted that the April price report
contained some troubling signs that price increases will be
accelerating in the months ahead.
   ``It would be a mistake to look at this report and say
inflationary pressures have abated,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting firm. ``I don't think this relief is going
to last.''
   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from September
through February, accounted for half of the increase in the overall
index in April, rising 3.1 percent, the biggest jump since a 3.2
percent rise in January 1987.
   Gasoline costs advanced 0.7 percent, while home heating oil shot
up 5.2 percent. Natural gas, which had declined in price in five of
the last six months, rose 4.3 percent.
   Analysts blamed the price pressures on rising world crude oil
prices in late April. But since that time, oil prices have
retreated somewhat, leading some economists to predict the April
price surge will be temporary.
   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in April, down from a 0.7 percent
March increase, as a sharp 16.3 percent drop in the price of eggs
and smaller declines in the price of fruit, fish and beef offset
price increases for pork, chicken, vegetables and coffee.
   The financial markets took the economic news in stride. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.55 points to
close at 1,990.55.
   Brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in the
producer price index and instead drew inspiration from falling
interest rates and a steady dollar.
   The dollar finished slightly higher in domestic dealings but
fell against the British pound, which has been gaining ground
despite central bank intervention to stem its rise.
   In another economic report Friday, the government said total
business sales surged 1.9 percent in March, the biggest advance in
more than a year, while business inventories were up a modest 0.3
percent.
   Analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declines
in inventories should translate into continued strong industrial
production in the months ahead.
   The Labor Department gave these additional details on its PPI
report for April:
   _New car prices fell 0.5 percent in April, a big turnaround from
a 1.0 percent increase in March.
   _Capital equipment costs were up a moderate 0.2 percent, half
the increase of the previous month.
   _Children's clothing prices gained 0.6 percent, while men's
clothing costs gained 0.1 percent, the same as the gain recorded
for women's apparel.
   The April increase brought the overall wholesale price index to
106.9. This means a selection of wholesale goods costing $100
during a 1982 base period would have cost $106.90 last month. This
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations, as are other
figures in the report.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished slightly higher against most
major currencies Friday in dull trading, as no significant
developments emerged to move the currency market and the British
pound stole the spotlight from the dollar.
   Gold prices edged higher in New York after falling in London.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold of
$451.10 a troy ounce at around 4 p.m. EDT, up from $450.90 late
Thursday.
   Traders said the dollar's fractional rise against most
currencies except the pound was mostly due to technical market
factors with participants balancing their positions in anticipation
of the weekend.
   ``There was really nothing going on; it looked like they were
just buying (pounds),'' said Joseph Cally, a currency trader for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The pound surged in European trading earlier in the day, despite
reported central bank intervention to stem its rise.
   A report from the Bank of England late Thursday indicating that
the central bank would prefer higher interest rates led currency
traders to conclude that the British government was limiting its
intervention against the pound's rise. That sentiment was
reinforced by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's apparent continued
opposition to massive intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
   ``The market feels safe pushing for higher sterling,'' said
Nigel Green, an assistant director at EBC-Amro Bank in London.
``They feel free from intervention.''
   The Bank of England did come into the market to sell pounds
several times Friday, dealers reported, but they said the
intervention was not heavy.
   Late in the day in London, the pound was quoted at $1.8910, up
from $1.8823 late Thursday. Later in New York the pound fetched
$1.8903, more than $1.8833 late Thursday.
   The most significant economic news of the day, the government's
report that U.S. wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in
April, failed to shake the currency market out of its lethargy,
dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.31 Japanese yen to a closing 124.70 yen. Later, in
London, it fell back to 124.68 yen. By the end of trading in New
York, the dollar was quoted at 124.77 yen, up from 124.53 yen late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6835 West German marks, up from 1.6816;
1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3987; 5.7107 French francs, up from
5.7005; 1,251.50 Italian lire, up from 1,251.00; and 1.2333
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2300.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.6830 West German marks, up from 1.6813; 1.4000 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3987; 5.7063 French francs, up from 5.7020;

   The federal government is investigating
whether real estate company Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. may have
violated federal securities laws related to corporate takeover
bids, according to documents released Friday.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it has information
suggesting that Paul A. Bilzerian, chairman of Singer Co., may have
entered into illegal arrangements with certain broker-dealers to
purchase stock in Carter Hawley Hale Stores, Cluett Peabody & Co.,
Hammermill Paper Co. and other publicly owned companies.
   The SEC also said documents suggest that Edward J. Bartolo Sr.,
head of Youngstown, Ohio-based DeBartolo Corp., may have entered
into undisclosed arrangements with Bilzerian with regard to the
acquisition of Cluett and Hammermill securities.
   ``These documents suggest that, among other things, DeBartolo
Sr. may have loaned millions of dollars to Bilzerian, to employees
of EJDC (DeBartolo Corp.) and to relatives of DeBartolo Sr. to be
used by them to purchase Hammermill and Cluett securities,'' the
SEC said.
   The agency also said the documents suggest that Bilzerian and
DeBartolo Sr. may have entered into an undisclosed profit-sharing
arrangement regarding Cluett securities.
   Bilzerian launched unsuccessful takeover bids for Cluett Peabody
in 1985 and Hammermill in 1986 and made millions in stock profits
and reimbursed expenses when he was outbid.
   A spokeswoman for DeBartolo Corp. referred calls to Stephen
Flood, DeBartolo's attorney. Several calls to Flood went unreturned.
   ``We have no comment,'' said Ted Levine, a partner at Wilmer,
Cutler & Pickering, a law firm representing Bilzerian.
   The SEC's assertions were contained in documents filed in U.S.
District Court last month as part of a bid to compel the senior
DeBartolo, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and other DeBartolo Corp.
officers to comply with subpoenas seeking brokerage account
information and records of contacts with Bilzerian.
   Federal law requires investors to disclose holdings in a
takeover target within 10 days of the time they exceed 5 percent of
the target company's shares. It also requires the disclosure of
anyone else acting in concert with the investor.
   Disclosure of a 5 percent stake alerts the investment community
and often sends a stock price up in anticipation of a high-priced
takeover bid.
   Bilzerian did not disclose any loans from or arrangements with
DeBartolo Sr. in his filings with the SEC on stock holdings in
Cluett or Hammermill, the agency said.
   The SEC investigation is part of a wide-ranging probe of
so-called ``stock parking.''
   Stock parking is an arrangement whereby one person sells
securities to another with the understanding they will be held and
later sold back. The SEC said it is frequently used as a vehicle to
conceal a beneficial ownership of securities and to evade
disclosure requirements.
   Herbert Janick, an attorney in the SEC's division of
enforcement, said in a declaration filed with the court that
several documents on their face reflect that DeBartolo Sr.
purchased Cluett and Hammermill securities in his own name and
loaned funds to relatives, Bilzerian, and DeBartolo Corp. employees
to buy the securities.
   Janick also said a page of handwritten notes suggests that
DeBartolo Sr. and Bilzerian entered into a profit-sharing
arrangement concerning Cluett securities and indicates that the two
men discussed a purchasing strategy.
   In addition to shopping centers and other real estate, DeBartolo
owns the San Francisco 49ers football team and the Pittsburgh
Penguins hockey team.

<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., the
financially troubled toy company, announced Friday that it was
extending until Wednesday an exchange offer made to the holders of
$335 million of its bonds in an effort to restructure its debt.
   The company, maker of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, has proposed
that investors exchange those securities for 6 million shares of
Coleco stock and new bonds worth $119 million. The company is in
default on that $335 million debt.
   Coleco Chairman Morton E. Handel has said the company might have
to seek protection from its creditors unless it can restructure the
debt and raise working capital.
   The company said in a statement it expected to improve the
exchange offer before the new deadline of 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday ``to
respond to discussions held between the company and
debentureholders over the past few weeks.
   ``The modified offers will substantially preserve the face
amount of the outstanding debentures, sharply reduce the company's
annual interest cost and provide debentureholders with a more
substantial interest in the company,'' the statement said.
   The company has extended the exchange offer twice before.
   Coleco also said it had terminated its agreement with Hallwood
Group Inc., the Cleveland company Coleco had hired to help it
restructure and avoid bankruptcy proceedings.
   Coleco also said it has cancelled its May 25 stockholders
meeting, which will be rescheduled.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles and board games such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
Industry souces say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rallied Friday as traders breathed a
sigh of relief that the government's latest round of borrowing was
over and that a new government report on inflation contained no
alarming disclosures.
   The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose { point, or $5 for
every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield fell to 9.17 percent from
9.22 percent late Thursday.
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis,
said traders were relieved that the Treasury's auction of $26
billion in notes and bonds had been completed.
   The three-day auction was completed on Thursday with the
Treasury's sales of $8.5 billion in 30-year bonds.
   Sohn said it appeared that Japanese investors, who have been
important figures at such auctions in recent years, had bought a
sizeable amount of both 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
   Sohn said the Labor Department's report of a 0.4 percent rise in
producer prices in April had been widely expected.
   The bond market was cheered, he said, with the tiny 0.1 percent
rise that occurred after excluding increases in the volatile food
and energy categories.
   Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank PLC in New
York, said the report appeared to place no additional pressure on
the Federal Reserve to tighten its credit policy.
   ``There has been a great deal of anxiety about the inflation
rate kicking up and the Fed having to respond more than it has.
This was very positive. The Fed won't move any further next week
when its policymakers meet,'' he said.
   Many analysts concluded that the Fed had tightened slightly
earlier this week in an effort to curb economic growth and head off
inflation.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 2-32 point, intermediate maturities rose \ point
and 20-year issues rose 13-32 point, according to figures provided
by the financial information firm Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.26 to 109.57. The Shearson Lehman Hutton
composite index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 2.27 to
1,146.51.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.87 to 277.40.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices of dollar and municipal bonds
rose ] point.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 3 basis points to 6.19
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.43 percent and one-year bills
fell 3 basis points to 6.81 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7 3-16 percent, up from 7 percent late Thursday.

   Government forecasters again have lowered
their prediction of oil prices and sharply raised their
expectations for imports this year.
   In the quarterly publication ``Short Term Energy Outlook,''
analysts of the Energy Information Administration said crude prices
for the rest of this year and next should run $15 to $18 a barrel,
a reduction of $1 to $2 from their January predictions.
   The average for this year should be about $16 as opposed to
$17.30 predicted in January, the forecasters said in the April
edition made available Friday.
   L%anwhile, imports of crude should rise 11 percent compared with
last year, from 4.57 million barrels per day to 5.06 million
barrels, the forecasters said. In January, the EIA, a
semi-independent arm of the Energy Department, predicted that crude
imports for 1988 would rise 2.6 percent to 4.71 million barrels per
day.
   Counting refined products, net petroleum imports this year
should increase 8.7 percent, from 5.77 million barrels per day to
6.27 million barrels. The January prediction was for a 4.1 percent
increase to 6.04 million barrels per day.
   Overall petroleum use should rise 1.8 percent this year, from
16.55 milion barrels per day to 6.85 million barrels, the
forecasters said. Earlier, they had predicted a 0.8 percent
increase to 16.66 million barrels. That would mean the import share
of the market would rise from 35 percent to 37 percent instead of
36 percent.
   Much of the predicted increase in consumption already has
occurred as a result of colder-than-normal temperatures in January
and February and as higher-than-expected demand by the chemical
industry.
   The revisions in forecasts included a boost in expected gross
national product this year, adjusted for inflation, of 2.2 percent
over last year. January's ``Outlook'' envisioned a 1.8 percent
increase.
   Similar upward revisions were made in several categories in the
January forecasts as it became clear that the October stock market
crash did not mean a slowdown in economic activity.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Banc Savings Association of Houston
acquired four insolvent Texas thrifts Friday in the first
consolidation under the government's plan to clean up the troubled
industry in Texas.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board will end up spending $138.3
million to merge the following thrifts into Coastal: Alliance
Savings and Loan Association, Houston; Colorado County Federal
Savings and Loan Association, Columbus; Security Savings and Loan
Association, Dickinson; and Cameron County Savings Association, San
Benito.
   The cost to liquidate the four thrifts would have been $160
million. All deposits will be protected, even those that exceed the
federally insured limit of $100,000, officials of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board said.
   The consolidation, part of the government's so called
``Southwest Plan,'' boosts Coastal's assets from $68 million to
$600 million, and adds 15 offices to its current five locations.
   Coastal will continue to operate all branches for three to five
months, but the arrangement then calls for the elimination of half
of the 20 branches.
   ``This is the beginning and we will begin to see a number of
future transactions that will provide stability to Texas thrifts,''
said FHLBB member Lawrence J. White. He called it a good deal for
the FSLIC, the agency that insures deposits, and for depositors.
   FHLBB Chairman M. Danny Wall said the transaction ``accomplishes
the Southwest Plan's key objectives of consolidation, strong
management and the infusion of new capital.''
   Private investors will provide Coastal with about $3.5 million
in fresh capital in the months following the transaction.
   The consolidation is the first since the FHLBB three months ago
announced its Southwest Plan to restructure the crippled Texas
thrift industry and cut the number of thrifts in the state by
one-third.
   ``The important thing here today _ we got the first olive out of
the jar, indicating the rest should come a lot easier,'' said FHLBB
member Roger Martin.
   Wall said allegations any merger decision would be based on
political favoritism was an ``absurdity.''
   In Texas, Gov. Bill Clements praised the action.
   ``The savings and loan industry is an important part of the
Texas economy. The announcement today by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board is a positive step in the direction of restoring health to
the industry,'' Clements said. ``Continued negotiations and
completed mergers under the Southwest Plan need to proceed in an
expeditious manner.''

<HEAD>Federal Investigators Probe Alleged Kickbacks at Intelsat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has subpoenaed records of Ford
Aerospace Corp. in what federal law enforcement sources said Friday
was an investigation of allegations that consultants of Ford
Aerospace and Hughes Aircraft Co. paid kickbacks to former
officials at the Intelsat satellite consortium.
   Documents relating to consultants hired by Ford Aerospace from
1973 to 1978 were subpoenaed in April by the U.S. attorney's office
in Washington, Ford Aerospace spokeswoman Susan Pearce said.
   The U.S. attorney's office is presenting evidence to a federal
grand jury, said the government sources, speaking on condition they
not be named.
   The sources said the investigation focuses on payments made by
Hughes and Ford Aerospace to consultants with ties to former
Intelsat director general Richard Colino and his former deputy,
Jose L. Alegrett.
   Pearce said the company has no reason to believe it was involved
in any improprieties and that it has ``cooperated fully'' with the
investigation. She said an internal inquiry by the company has
revealed no wrongdoing by Ford Aerospace or its employees.
   Colino pleaded guilty last year to siphoning kickbacks out of
construction and financing contracts for Intelsat's new Washington
headquarters. He is serving a six-year federal prison term.
   Colino's attorney, Nathan Lewin, said his client had disclosed
all he knew about wrongdoing at Intelsat.
   Alegrett lives in Venezuela. His Washington attorney, Mark
Shaffer, was not in his Washington office Friday afternoon,
according to a secretary.
   Intelsat legal counsel Arnold Weiss said Colino and Alegrett
were fired by Intelsat in December 1986 and that ``we're not
aware'' that any people currently with the consortium are involved
in ``whatever matters are under investigation'' by the U.S.
attorney's office.
   Ford Aerospace and Hughes Aircraft, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp., are the two main suppliers of satellites to the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization.
   Ford is completing a $600 million contract to build 15
satellites for Intelsat, while Hughes has an $875 million contract
for new satellites. Intelsat channels international telephone,
video and data communications on a system of satellites.
   In a civil suit filed against Colino last year, Intelsat accused
him of arranging for the agency to pay half a million dollars to
Ford Aerospace to have the company study Intelsat's satellite
needs. As part of the agreement, Ford was to pay $125,000 to
Ingetel S.A., a Chilean consulting firm, the lawsuit said.
   The pending suit said Ingetel agreed to kick back to Colino and
an associate $100,000. Colino and the associate, according to
Intelsat, provided Ingetel confidential traffic data developing by
Intelsat, which Ingetel used with few changes in a report to Ford.

<HEAD>New Brazilian Constitution Limits Interest Rates for Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the surprise and dismay of many
bankers and economists, the Brazilian congress has voted to limit
interest rates to 12 percent annually under the nation's new
constitution.
   The 559-member congress, sitting as a constituent assembly to
rewrite the constitution, approved the measure Wednesday night
despite protests by economic experts that the limit was unworkable.
   The article says banks may not charge on any financial operation
more than 12 percent a year plus ``monetary correction'' for
inflation, which this year is estimated will reach 600 percent.
Banks now charge as much as 100 percent a year interest in addition
to monetary correction.
   The congress also voted to bar banks from activities outside the
financial market, such as selling insurance or operating travel
agencies.
   The measure drew sharp criticism from government officials and
the financial community.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said he was ``stupefied'' by
the legislators' decision.
   Rep. Antonio Delfim Netto, a former finance minister who voted
against the measure, told his colleagues on the congressional
floor, ``if we can't control the price of a can of sardines, why do
we have the pretension to control interest rates?''
   Former Central Bank President Fernao Bracher called the measure
``generous, but extremely harmful.'' He predicted the interest
ceiling would lead to a consumer spending boom, hyperinflation and
capital flight.
   The author of the amendment, Rep. Fernando Gasparian, a wealthy
farmer and businessman, told the newspaper Jornal do Brasil of Rio,
``my amendment is neither poetic nor leftist. The banks are digging
into everyone's pocket... And because of this, many farmers are
going under.''
   The constitution is Brazil's eighth and will replace the
authoritarian document handed down in 1969 by a military regime
that ruled from 1964 to 1985. The new constitution is expected to
be ready late this year.

<HEAD>Court Hears Koppers, Beazer Injunction Arguments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court heard arguments
Friday on a temporary injunction suspending a $1.7 billion hostile
takeover attempt of Koppers Co. by British industrialist Brian
Beazer and the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   After hearing both sides of the issue, the three-judge panel of
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal will rule later whether U.S.
District Court Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles was correct to
order the injunction in April because of antitrust questions.
   The injunction effectively put on hold a $60-per-share hostile
tender offer for the Pittsburgh-based Koppers by the Beazer group.
The offer has been extended week-to-week and now has a May 18
deadline.
   Koppers contends that competition could be weakened in the
Southern California aggregate market for sand, gravel and hard
stone for construction if properties owned there by Koppers and
Beazer are combined.
   Attorney John Bodner Jr. said appointment of a trustee to
oversee the aggregate portion of the company while competition and
other questions are resolved would be ``very difficult if not
impossible.''
   While Koppers has an aggregate facility in Irwindale, he said
most of the personnel connected with it work in Long Beach,
Pittsburgh or other Kopper offices.
   Bodner also said that Koppers is involved in ``high secret,
sensitive negotiations'' relating to increasing its reserves of
sand, gravel and hard stone. And the Beazer group has a similar
business, almost as big as Koppers, he said.
   ``The competitors would love to know what we're up to,'' he
said, predicting that if the takeover was allowed some employees
would feel obligated to discuss those matters with the new owners.
   ``They will learn it the instant they acquire us,'' Bodner said.
   Mark Leddy, an attorney representing the Beazer group, called
the injunction ``extraordinary and unprecedented'' and said it
should be thrown out.

   Ninety-two employees at the Federated
Department Stores Inc. corporate offices in Cincinnati were laid
off Friday as part of the retailer's acquisition by Campeau Corp.
of Canada.
   Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the layoffs range from
senior management to clerical staff.
   She said many workers were relieved that the layoffs weren't
more extensive at the headquarters, which has 530 workers in
downtown and regional offices.
   ``Pretty much all departments are going to be affected,'' she
said. ``What is happening is a restructuring of the integrated
organization. The key is that all department functions are going to
be maintained, which again is a much better position than we had
originally anticipated.''
   Campeau officials have said repeatedly that some Federated
workers would lose their jobs at the corporate headquarters as part
of the acquisition.
   ``It's been no secret from the outset that there would be
cutbacks, and people are ready to get on with their lives and
probably will feel some relief today that their futures are
defined,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   She said those who lost their jobs Friday will receive severance
packages ranging from at least 13 weeks of pay to as many as 20
weeks. The company also will help employees with job placement
counseling.
   Federated was acquired by Toronto-based Campeau following a
two-month takeover battle. Control of Cincinnati-based Federated
passed to Campeau last week when the developer announced it had
accepted more than 87 million shares tendered by the retailer's
stockholders. The merger is expected to be completed in about a
month.
